# The Story of the Scepter of Command
*As sung by the halfling storytellers in the Year of Honeyed Sun*

(A translation note: English does not have a good way to translate the "past/current/future" tense that is common in halfling stories. I have done the best I can.)

*It began at an inn in a small village in the desert; it began in the hands of a madman; it began in the  heart of an evil king. It begins with a burning need for revenge, it begins with the shame of the good-heart fool, it begins with the fear and pain of a mother. It will begin with demons, and devils, and gods, and the prayers of humans.*

*It is a story of generations, of echos, of the wanderer Wellby whose song burned bright, burns bright, will burn bright, of his companions who travel, traveled, will travel with him, of the people and places and hearts they touched, will touch, have touched.*

*Long ago, now, tomorrow, an emperor wishes to rule: Apollyon he is called. His song is, was, will be one of anger, of arrogance, of the violence of hate; his soul breeds darkness, a vision of sterile purity  that corrupts all it touches.*

*A devil he sought, seeks, will seek. The power of enchanting and twisting, of coercion and control. It is no easy thing to trick a devil, to bind it, to sear away its essence, and yet the Emperor does this, did this, will do this. The devil is caught, a servant of Fierna, a champion of the twisting of minds, and yet its mind is the one bound into the fresh silver of the scepter. And unbound too, for even now the there are echoes of the story's end. 

*The scepter sings, its violent harmonies ripping consent from all who hear it. You will, you did, you become. You must, it sang, and none can silence the song it shouts from Apollyon's hand. Except the Great Enemy, the Bringer of Silence, the Breaker of Songs. But that bleak harmony is not this song. 

*In our song, there is quiet for a time, for all time, for no time. The Great Enemy roars and empires fall, and yet not all is destroyed. The scepter lives, in quiet, in silence.*

*Until another shattered melody starts, has started, will start, the broken songs of those yearning for madness. In the desert they howl, howled, will howl, incoherent, until their howls grow to a chorus, a symphony, and suddenly join in awful harmony. A leader sees, saw, will see, and binds the cacophony to a purpose. An old purpose, renewed, under the light of the Betrayer Moon, the Mad One to summon, a curse to spread.*

*But the howls are trapped, for the mystical will of the people of the land of the desert is strong, was strong, will be strong.*
