# Wend
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> An [[Fey|archfey]] (she/her)  
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

Wend, the Silence That Follows, an archfey and the ruler of [[Hollowdark]]. She is often spoken of in the same sentence as [[Harrow]], the Shadow That Looms, ruler of [[Darkfall]]; whether these are truly two separate entities, or two aspects of the same dread, is not known.
