One of the guardians of the [[Land of the Dead]], wounded in battle by [[Grash]] and driven to the material plane, in pain and draining the spiritual essence from the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]]. Healed by [[Kenzo]], although not yet returned to the [[Land of the Dead]]. Motua is a Giradi, a creature that is native to the [[Land of the Dead]], a guardian, a protector, and also a guide who makes sure that the souls of the dead reach their destination beyond the veil and prevents interference with the journey of souls through the transition from life to death.Â
