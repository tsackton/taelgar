An elder wyrm, one of the original children of the [[Divine Presence]]. 

Sought to overthrow the gods, breaking the order of things that has held since the [[Riving]], freeing the elder races from the binds and power of the Embodied Gods. 

Cha'mutte was defeated by the [[Heroes of the Great War]] at the [[Battle of Urlich Pass]]

%% Tim: I set this as just status/tim as I am not really sure that we need a detailed note here, although obviously you might have either secret stuff to add that relates to his fight with Apollyon or alternatively might want to set the status to wip or external or something to indicate we intend/should include more details here %%
