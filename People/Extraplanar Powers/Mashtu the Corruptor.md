![[mashtu-the-corrupter.png|right|420]]A powerful demon of the [[Abyss]], known for desiring the defiling of sacred waters across the [[Green Sea]].  

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
Mashtu was the patron of the warlock [[Urgall the Black]], and charged him with a [[Urgall's scroll|quest]] to aid in corrupting a number of holy sites across the [[Green Sea]]. However, the quest stalled in [[Vetta]], and in DR 1748, Mashtu was [[Session 81 (DuFr)|destroyed]] by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], banished back to the [[Abyss]] to brood.
