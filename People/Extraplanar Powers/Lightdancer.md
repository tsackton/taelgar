Lord Egon, the Lightdancer, is the ruler of the domain of [[Shimmersong]]. Most of the time, they are vibrant, vivacious, obsessed with color and light and the beauty of the realm, but they have a dark side. For some time each year the Lightdancer retreats to hidden caves underground, and color fades from [[Shimmersong]], while the Winter Knights patrol the borders protecting the realm from dangers.
