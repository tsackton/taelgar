The Queen of Sunset was once the ruler of [[Amberglow]], known for spinning beautiful, magical thread from the clouds and sky. But long ago she vanished, and her realm has fallen into decay since that day.Â  

Her memories opened [[Session 61 (DuFr)]]: ^97cec2

*As a group of travelers gathers here, some reunited after a long separation, others newly met, the Cloudspinner feels their presence even from her prison, far away, and she drifts in thought.

*She remembers the days of plenty in [[Amberglow]], when she ruled as the Queen of Sunsets, when the glorious colors of the evening sun turned the sky and the grass and the water and the rocks to ever-changing paintings, when she spun threads of magic and color from the colors of the sky, when her court dazzled any who came with their beauty and elegance.

*She remembers the fateful day she was tricked, bound and captive, her tools stolen, her life constrained, [[Amberglow]] slowly falling into ruin. She remembers how she could feel the footsteps of decay, a constant reminder of her fate as the color ran out of [[Amberglow]], her magnificent cloud palace fell into disarray, her court and servants fled, or lost, save the few who hung on, in desperation or fear or confusion, slowly turning as pale and colorless as the land itself.

*She remembers the darkness that crept over her realm then, the cursed ones, the hags and tricksters and malicious spirits of the Unseelie Court, who came after she was gone, who conquered and claimed [[Amberglow]] as their own, who filled the realm with darkness and despair. She remembers how they hunted down her remaining subjects, and how they desecrated the places that once held such beauty and light.

*But she also remembers the resistance, the brave Fey and other creatures who fought back against the invaders, who formed secret alliances and underground networks, who kept the spark of hope alive in [[Amberglow]], even in its darkest days. [[Typhina]], the protector of the Heartwood Grove; Lirien, the Lady of the Lake, who drained the river of time; Bellator, the changeling king who sacrificed himself to hide the ruins of the Cloud Palace from those who would mean harm.

*So she watches, and she waits, and she hopes, for the day when she will be free, and when [[Amberglow]] will once again be a realm of beauty and wonder. Until then, she will continue to fight, and to dream, and to hold onto the memory of what once was, and what could be again.

*And our story fades from the Cloudspinner, and turns now to the travelers at Lastlight Falls, who may yet have a small role to play in the story of [[Amberglow]].
