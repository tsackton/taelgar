![[abha-v2.jpg|right|400]]Abha is a [[Sonkar Mystai|mystai of Sonkar]], a truthspeaker who has the divine ability to see the true nature of the world. She is a powerful spellcaster and is often called to resolve difficult or complicated requests for judgement and justice. 

Abha, like [[Sonkar]], sometimes appears cold and distant, but her isolating demeanor masks a deep concern for the world and for [[Dunmar]]. 

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
During the [[Siblings War]], Abha served as an ally and advisor to [[Nayan Karnas]], using her divine powers to attempt to disentangle the truth, or lies, of rumors of [[Agata]]'s influence on [[Sura]]. She was increasingly discredited by [[Nayan Karnas]] as he descended into paranoia, until the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] was able to at least partially get through to him. In the aftermath, she helped negotiate the end of the [[Siblings War]] between [[Sura|Nayan Sura]] and [[Nayan Karnas]].
