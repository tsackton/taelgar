A Dunmari pastoralist.

%%^Date:1748%%

* (DR:: 1748-03-15) Devana's family was attacked by marauding axebeaks, supernaturally enraged by an ancient amulet from the Great War, which had been buried inactive for centuries until uncovered by [[Arcus]] in the [[Dunmari Fort (Gomat)|old Dunmari fort]] east of [[Gomat]]. One of his sons and nearly half his animals were killed in this attack (date is approx).
