%% story

[[Kirian]], the innkeeper of the eponymously named [[Kirian's]] in [[Tokra]], grew up in [[Tokra]], and rode off in his youth with a war band, raiding [[Kobolds]] along the [[Myraeni Gap]] to the west, around [[Songara]], until he was wounded in an ambush. After that he returned to [[Tokra]] with his gold and treasure, and opened the inn. That was maybe 15 years ago, and now he is proud of what he built, and enjoys reminiscing about the time in camp with his companions, talking and laughing about what they would do with all the gold they would find.
