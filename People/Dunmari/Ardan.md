The middle-aged Dunmari Head Archivist at the [[Tokra]] [[Archives]]. Cautious to a fault and rather uninterested in administration, allowing many basic functions of the [[Archives]] to drift into disorganization and uselessness through lack of attention during his tenure. 
%%^Date:1748%%
As of mid-July 1748, has allowed [[Govir]] to take over some of the administrative burden, at the urging of [[Dunmar Fellowship]], and has secured funds for [[Govir]] to hire additional scribes and clerks.
