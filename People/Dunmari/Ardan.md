The middle-aged Dunmari Head Archivist at the [[Tokra]] [[Archives]]. Cautious to a fault and rather uninterested in administration, allowing many basic functions of the [[archives]] to fail, or at least drift into disorganization and uselessness through lack of attention, during his tenure. 

As of mid-July 1748, has allowed [[Govir]] to take over some of the administrative burden, at the urging of [[The Dunmar Fellowship]], and has secured funds for [[Govir]] to hire additional scribes and clerks.
