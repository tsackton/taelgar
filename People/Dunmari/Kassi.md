Librarian of the Lakan Monastery. Partner to Basu. Shy, reclusive, hides in the library a lot. Some "traditional librarian" properties.
 
Deeply religious and dedicated to Laka; takes an intellectual form for her. Smart.

Spoke with her July 1st after helping Basu; she was grateful and accomondating. Discussed names of gods, gods without worshippers, and other topics.
 
Has promised information and research on Rai, Anida/Yezali, and maps of the Tokra area, but needs 2-3 days to collect research and copy information.
