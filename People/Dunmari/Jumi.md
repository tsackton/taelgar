%% Notes

Cintra's daughter. A young girl, maybe 3 years old, with light brown skin and dark shoulder-length hair, big, curious brown eyes, and a chubby face. Also a powerful divine soul sorcerer who can already cast Mold Earth. Was a prisoner of Agata for 3 1/2 months, from early Feb through late May 1748. During this time partially turned to a wooden puppet. Rescued by party, cured by Seeker's dispel magic. 

PC Interactions
 
Party saved her and her mother, will be forever grateful. Especially fond of Seeker who removed the puppet curse from her. Likely won't remember much of her ordeal later in life but will always remember Seeker.
