A mystai of Laka, based at the [[Lakan Monastery]] in [[Tokra]]. Though old and mostly retired from daily activities at the monastery, he remains surprising fit and skilled in hand to hand combat, and is still a valued trainer. 

Later became notable beyond the mystai community, for his role as one of the early mentors of [[Kenzo]], of the [[Dunmar Fellowship]].
