A goat herder from the area around Karawa. 

In April 1748, she and the group of herders she traveled with were delayed returning to [[Karawa]] for the [[Festival of Rebirth]] because of a large fire, started by lightning from the endless storm around [[Stormcaller Tower]]. She met [[Dunmar Fellowship]] on the road, and warned them to flee east.
