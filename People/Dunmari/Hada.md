The head scribe of the military section of the [[Tokra]] [[Archives]]. He was researching, with [[Govir]], the events surrounding [[The Exile of Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] in DR 1625 from [[Tokra]] in the [[Archives]], in support of [[Govir]]'s planned treatise on the miracles of the [[The Five Siblings|The Five Siblings]] in aid of the Nayan dynasty. 

In 1748, Hada was captured by werewolves of the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]], along with [[Govir]], his superior at the [[Archives]]. Imprisoned in the werewolves' hidden lair in [[Tokra]], he was eventually killed by [[Govir]] while [[Govir]] was transformed into a werewolf and unaware of his actions under the curse of lycanthropy.
