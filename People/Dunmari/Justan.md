A Dunmari man, from a family of horse herders traveling on the lands around Tokra. 
%%^Date:1748%%
In the spring of 1748, his family lost much of their wealth from famine and disease, associated with the Tokra refugee crisis caused by the [[Summer Gnoll Raids of 1748]]. He left his home and joined with a group of other disillusioned and unsavory Dunmari in the Copper Hills, and began raiding travelers on the Tokra-Darba road. On July 21, 1748, encountered [[The Dunmar Fellowship]] and was intimidated into joining them to fight the rumored dragon (actually wyverns) on the road by [[Delwath]]. Survived the wyvern battle only to be killed by [[Casian]]'s fireball on July 23rd, 1748. 

His story was heard by [[Kenzo]] and collected for the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]]: [[Justan's Story]].
