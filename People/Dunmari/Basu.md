%%Notes
Eccentric artisan creating magic items at the Lakan monastery. Specializes in extradimensional objects, which he makes with infused energy from the weak spot to Arborea below the monastery.
 
Crotchety and a bit rude even, fairly gruff. Not the most popular in the monastery and struggles to get acolytes to train with him. But very knowledgabe about the fabric of reality.
 
PC Interactions
 
After aiding him in dealing with the power of Arborea in the elven ruins, he has promised to make a portal hole for the party with stone walls and a hanging organizer included. It will be done around July 15th.
