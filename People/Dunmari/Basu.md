The grumpy craftsman of the Lakan monks, known for creating magic items that channel extradimensional space, like bags of holding and portable holes. 

With [[Kassi]], although not formally married. 

Made the [[Portable Hole]] for the party after they helped him gather extraplanar energy of [[Arborea]] from the [[Elven Arborea Workshop]] beneath the monastery.
