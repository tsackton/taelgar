One of the few remaining masters of the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]]. Lives in the [[Garamjala Desert]] with his partner [[Pava]] and apprentice [[Amil]]. 

Lives an isolated life in the desert, concerned with [[Pava]] and with what is left of the Order's mission. 

Born in DR 1670s near [[Karawa]].Â Apprentice through DR 1690s, wanderer through DR 1710s, and master since DR 1720. He was a loner as a kid, drawn to stories, back when the Mystai of [[Bhishma]] traveled around gathering tales and histories of the people, and drawn to this life. Met [[Pava]] at the [[Feast of Bhishma]] the year they were both raised out of their apprenticeship, and have been traveling together since.

After the breaking of the Order in 1717, took up residence in the desert, watch the comings and goings on the plains, rescue the lost and the desperate who come seeking treasure, glory, or death in the desert. Quiet life but time for contemplation and still many stories of lives lived on these lands that are forgotten.
