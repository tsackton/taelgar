![[candrosa-portrait.png|right|400]]Candrosa serves as Speaker of the [[Shakun Mystai]], acting as the leader of the [[Temple of Shakun]] in [[Karawa]] and the public face of the mystai. He oversees rites, initiations, and dream-visions; and serves as a councilor to the temple hierarchy in Karawa. 
## Personality & Outlook
Candrosa is proudly Dunmari and protective of temple secrets, second-guessing himself whenever his caution endangers others. He is at is best preaching to a crowd, but doubts himself when forced to make strategic decisions, especially concerning the [[Shakun's Protection|magical protections of Shakun]].

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
The loss of the [[Heart of Shakun]] exposed a streak of desperate improvisation: he will risk trust, even [[Session 26 (DuFr)|manipulating visions]] if the alternative is watching the mesa crumble. Since the Heart’s recovery he is humbler, quicker to confer with allies, and intent on rebuilding a wider circle of initiates.
