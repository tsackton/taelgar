Candrosa serves as Speaker of the [[Shakun Mystai]], acting as high priest, civic voice, and guardian of [[Karawa]]’s mesa-top temple. He balances political diplomacy with the desperate work of keeping [[Shakun's Protection]] functioning while the borderlands reel from gnoll incursions and otherworldly threats.

## Overview
- Oversees rites, initiations, and the weaving of dream-visions that guide mystai acolytes and border sentinels.  
- Coordinates with [[Elder Kisa]], [[Havdar]], and visiting leaders to align temple magic with the town’s survival needs.  
- Wields the [[Dreamweaver Staff]], channeling dreams to scout echo realms, inspire allies, and—when his judgment falters—nudge companions toward actions he feels the goddess demands.

## Personality & Outlook
Pragmatic yet devout, Candrosa carries the weight of Karawa’s safety on little sleep. He is proudly Dunmari and protective of temple secrets, second-guessing himself whenever his caution endangers others. The loss of the [[Heart of Shakun]] exposed a streak of desperate improvisation: he will risk trust, even manipulating visions (as with [[Delwath]] in [[Session 26 (DuFr)]]) if the alternative is watching the mesa crumble. Since the Heart’s recovery he is humbler, quicker to confer with the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], and intent on rebuilding a wider circle of initiates.

## Role in Recent Events
- **Hyena Rampage (Session 1):** Called on the newly formed Fellowship after the hyena assault, granting them authority to investigate and defend Karawa.  
- **Festival Crisis (Sessions 4–6):** Confided that Shakun’s wards were failing, convened the April 4th council, and chose to remain in the temple when most townsfolk fled.  
- **Siege & Aftermath (Sessions 17–19):** Endured the gnoll siege, coordinated relief with [[Tharandros]] and [[Havdar]], and safeguarded party treasures while new sorties probed the desert.  
- **Heart of Shakun Quest (Sessions 26–29):** Admitted to steering Delwath’s visions, revealed [[Cintra]]’s disappearance with the Heart, and empowered the Fellowship with an abbreviated initiation plus a scroll of sending for the rescue mission.  
- **Restored Web (Session 32):** Led funerary rites for fallen mystai, resumed full initiations once Cintra returned, and orchestrated the [[Feast of Bhishma]] as a public renewal of Shakun’s covenant.

## Relationships & Resources
- **[[Cintra]] & [[Jumi]]:** Reveres the Supreme Oracle and her daughter; their absence forced him into reluctant command, and he now defers to Cintra on strategic uses of the restored Heart.  
- **[[Dunmar Fellowship]]:** Relies on their broad reach—dream-walks with them via the staff, hides contraband relics for their expeditions, and trusts them to speak truths he cannot reveal publicly.  
- **[[Havdar]] & town elders:** Acts as moral authority within councils, tempering Havdar’s militancy with long-term spiritual stewardship.  
- **[[Tharandros]]’ herd:** Maintains a fragile alliance forged through shared defense of the land’s vitality; he keeps the secret of the Heart’s web to a narrow list that now includes the centaur chieftain.  
- **Mystai Initiates:** Mentors acolytes like [[Alesh]] and, more recently, [[Drikod]] and [[Kenzo]], tying their memories into the lattice that powers the mesa wards.

## Timeline Highlights
- **1748-03-22:** Summons the party after the hyena raid and begins sharing intelligence on border attacks ([[Session 1 (DuFr)]]).  
- **1748-04-04:** Oversees the evacuation council and pledges to defend the temple when the populace flees west ([[Session 5 (DuFr)]], [[Session 6 (DuFr)]]).  
- **1748-04-24:** Briefs the Fellowship on gnoll movements, demonic rumors, and the taboo topic of Shakun’s waning protection ([[Session 18 (DuFr)]]).  
- **1748-05-23:** Confesses the Heart’s absence, shares the truth of the initiation network, and equips the party for the Wellspring mission ([[Session 26 (DuFr)]]).  
- **1748-06-01:** Welcomes the Heart back to Karawa and begins coordinating the rebuilding of the warding web ([[Session 29 (DuFr)]]).  
- **1748-06-18:** Guides the Feast of Bhishma, publicly backing [[Sura|Nayan Sura]]’s push to rally Dunmari forces while quietly tasking the Fellowship with the next leg toward [[Tokra]] ([[Session 32 (DuFr)]]).  

## Story Hooks
- Seek his dream-guided insight on lingering traces of [[Agata]]’s curses or on the Chardonian expeditions skirting Dunmar’s borders.  
- Broker dialogue between Candrosa and skeptical allies (such as [[Tharandros]] or Tokran officials) to widen the network powering Shakun’s wards.  
- Investigate whether Candrosa can safely replicate the emergency initiation that gave the Fellowship partial access to the Heart’s lattice—he fears both the cost and the necessity.  
- Unearth the limits of the Dreamweaver Staff: Candrosa suspects its prior owners left safeguards that a skilled artificer could reactivate, strengthening his ability to watch the echo realms.
