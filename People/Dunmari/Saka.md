%% notes
 
Mystai of Bhishma. One of the few masters who didn't seek to help with the cleansing of the land. Grew up outside Tokra and always said she'd return there when she could no longer travel; north and east of the city in the fertile land outside, gathering the stories of the horse herders there.
 
**Age: unknown, but old, at least 70**  
**Current Location (June 1748): unknown, but probably north of Tokra**

Have not met her, but learned of her from Pava and Avaras.
 
Also saw her briefly in the Hall of Stories:  
"An older woman talking to a middle-aged man, the older woman saying that this is going to fail, it is too big a risk, and she will not go. The corruption, the pestilence of evil planes that lingered in this land is not so easy to remove, and a failure will be devastating."
