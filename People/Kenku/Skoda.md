![[skoda.png|right|400]]A kenku woman in late middle age, who travels the islands of the [[Eastern Green Sea]] with her partner [[Nahto]]. She is fey-touched and has a hint of magic about her. 

%%^Date:1748-10-14%%
In early October 1748, she was captured by a recently awakened aboleth and dragged to its undersea lair with [[Nahto]]. She was rescued, along with other captives, by [[Wellby]] and his companions on October 14, 1748. However, she suffered from the aboleth's curse, and could no longer survive without frequently being immersed in water. After telling [[Wellby]] of her friend [[Arryn|Arryn the Wanderer]], a wizard living in the northern part of the islands who could aid him with magic to make his way to the [[Feywild]], she traveled with other victims of the aboleth to the sea elf village off the coast of [[Quanyi]], where she remains a guest until a cure for the aboleth's curse can be found.
