Geoffrey, possibly a false name, was an traveler who arrived in [[Roscombe]] from [[Valcroix]] in the autumn of 1714, taking a room at [[The Traveler's Rest]] for roughly six months. According to [[Bertrand LeBlanc]] and [[Emma Cole]], he kept largely to himself, ate alone with his nose in a book, and made repeated solo excursions into the [[Highmoor]], sometimes staying out for a week at a time. Shortly before the spring thaw he outfitted himself with ropes, ladders, and other climbing gear, and left for parts unknown.
