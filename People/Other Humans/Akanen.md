>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

One of the Spice Lords of Medju, and a collector of rarities, especially the weird, wild, and wonderful. He is especially interested in collecting rare monster parts, and is reasonably well known for this across the [[Eastern Green Sea]].

Through various backchannels and merchant contacts, Artem has learned about Lord Akanen (ak-ah-nen, rhymes with pen), one of the Spice Lords of Medju, a group of extremely rich merchants / oligarchs who are suspected of being the real power in Medju, making their wealth and holding on to power by controlling the caravan routes across the desert to the south. 
 
Lord Akanen is a collector of rarities, especially the weird, wild, and wonderful, the stranger the better. He is especially fascinated by monstrosities, and is known as both the patron of the Hall of Wonders (name is just a rumor, it probably has a more elaborate / better name in Medju that doesn't matter for this adventure), and the owner of a renowned private collection. His interest in rare monster parts is well known.

What is less well known is that he maintains his wealth and power in part by a deal with a branch of a royal family of djinn. Some claim this is because in his youth, Lord Akanen was secretly a powerful sorcerer and freed two djinn trapped against their will. Others claim he swore himself to the prince of this house of djinn as a servant. Still others claim he learned the secret arts of controlling air elementals in hidden places deep in the desert and used those to bind a djinn to his service for 100 years. Whatever the truth, it is rumored that he can command the djinn to grant a wish to those he particularly favors, or in exchange for a particularly valued treasure. 
 
Artem, then, is seeking Lord Akanen, with the reasonable hope (probably validated by several contacts) that the fiery heart of the rare remorhaz of the northern wastes will be of sufficient value to earn a wish in return.
