![[roman-portrait.png|right|400]]Roman is a dapper, silver-haired gentleman who runs [[The Silver Wolf]], a high-end inn and restaurant frequented by merchants in town for the famous markets of [[Zvervinka]]. His impeccable manners mask his self-centered perspective; Roman is always on the lookout for an angle to improve things for himself. Nonetheless, he knows how to run a high-end inn, and his establishment is a hub for gossip and intrigue.
