%% Meta: 3rdish level ranger swarmkeeper birds 
halflings and cousins, from everywhere, but originally from numerous small towns and villages in the Mostreve Hills. Both restless types, more at home in the forests and valleys of the Mostreve Hills than a bustling inn. Adra has a faint ghostly bird that sometimes lands on her, often changing form between different types of sparrows , songbirds, and hummingbirds and other times splitting into two or three. Her cousin, when the number of ghostly birds is in danger of growing, will sometimes tap her and point it all, and they all disappear for a moment. These two clearly work together, but have not travelled with Vahaiya much before.

Showing interest in the birds perks up Adra, the bird loving halfling woman. She clearly prefers her birds to people, but will introduce Celyn to six ghostly birds:
 

Featherfoot, a brown and white sparrow

Whistle, a large black crow who seems to like to look at everything and is always releculant to vanish.   

Snapper, a  blue jay with a viciously sharp beak  

Glide, a small kestrel who is constantly in motion  

Buzzglow, a green and red hummingbird, who seems to sparkle in the firelight  

Goldsong, a yellow warbler, who seems to twitter and sing a lot, but silently. Celyn can't hear its song, but Adra looks pleased and whispers to it, "A beautiful song".  

  

(At this, Damien jokes that if only he could learn from Whistle's music he'd be twice the singer he is today)

  

These birds vanish quickly after each introduction, although Celyn can just glimpse them occasionally out of the corner of his eye, if he doesn't look too hard.
