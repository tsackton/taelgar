### **Wendel Quickstep** 
(male halfling, late 70s)

The proprietor of *The Windward Sail*, a busy sailor's tavern in Fiskurth, and a place where Wellby presumably hung around a bit in his youth. Known as a place for tales and stories - some true, many not - and a place for gossip, as well as a place to find a crew. Has a few dirty, cramped rooms stacked with "human sized" bunks, and some slightly more comfortable halfling rooms.
