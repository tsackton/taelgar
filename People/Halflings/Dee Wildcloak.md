## Event
Dee was part of a party of adventurers (herself, [[Dain Goldhammer]], and [[Alban]]) who traveled to [[Stormcaller Tower]] and returned to Chardon with several treasures, including [[Hralgar's Eyes]] and the [[Binding Stones]]. 

- (DR:: 1747-12-23): Arcus, Servius, Dee Wildcloak, Dain Goldhammer, and Alban leave Chardon together, on a mission to find treasure for the Society of the Open Scroll, funded by [[Fausto]].
