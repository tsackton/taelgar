An old, wrinkled halfling, often quiet and sleepy, but with surprising wit. The most important of the three current inn keepers of [[The Crossroads Inn]] in [[Cleenseau]] along with [[Venra Stonebridge]] and [[Willow Stonebridge]]. Often called Grandmother Marigold, she is considered the matriach and wisest of the [[Stonebridges]]. 

She knows much of the history of The Crossroads Inn and is proud of its ancient heritage.
