A young, rambunctious and excessively curious [[Halflings|halfling]], traveling with the [[Charmhearts|Charmheart]] trading caravan as a scout and general hand. 

In March 1748, was taken with madness by contact with Abyssal energy during a demon summoning at [[Raven's Hold]], on the northern border of [[Dunmar]]. While partially cured by the defeat of the demon by [[The Dunmar Fellowship]], as of the summer of 1748 he still struggles with speech, and nightmares.
