![[willow-copperharp.jpg|right|250]]Willow Copperharp is a halfling sailor, formerly part of the crew of the [[Stormdancer]], who joined the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] out of a desire to witness and document their quest to end [[Apollyon]]. She is a storyteller, a poet; serious and soft-spoken, but eloquent. She is religious as halflings go, devoted to the [[First Ones]].
