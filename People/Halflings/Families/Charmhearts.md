# The Charmhearts

The Charmhearts are a prominent family of [[Halflings|halfling]] overland traders. They trace their history to the [[Greater Sembara]] region, but for the past several generations they have made their living on long distance trade, bringing spices, furs, and dyed cloth from [[Sembara]] to [[Dunmar]], as well as sometimes apple brandy from Adderfell. 

Their traditional route brings them across the lower elevation eastern passes across the [[Sentinel Range]] on the road to [[Karawa]], often crossing as early as the middle of March, aiming to arrive in [[Karawa]] in time to trade at the [[Festival of Rebirth]], usually in early April. After a year circuiting [[Dunmar]], they return to [[Sembara]] via the high passes from [[Tokra]] in late spring when the snows melt. 

They are a serious trading family, and always travel prepared for danger, especially across the passes and the open frontier north of [[Karawa]]. 
%%^Date:1748%%
In 1748, the Charmhearts encountered trouble on the road from [[Ausson's Crossing]] to [[Karawa]]. Descending the passes on March 19, 1748, the Charmheart caravan stopped to rest and recover after the hard journey, at a well-used campsite near the old Dunmari fortress called Raven's Hold. [[Ander Charmheart]], a young and sometimes foolish member of the clan, went exploring, and was caught in a wave of demonic energy from a demon summoning. Driven mad, the Charmheart caravan was forced to deal with the situation in [[Karawa]]. 

The demon at Raven's Hold was later killed by [[The Dunmar Fellowship]], but [[Ander Charmheart]] only slowly and partially recovered. What is more, during this time, gnoll raiders rampaged across [[eastern Dunmar]], and little trading was possible. The Charmhearts made their way to [[Tokra]] with crowds of Dunmari refugees, but the sickness and war seriously disrupted their trading year, causing significant losses. Later, they left [[Tokra]] for [[Darba]], hoping for better luck.
