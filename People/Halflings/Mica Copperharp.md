![[mica-copperharp.jpg|right|250]]Mica Copperharp is a halfling sailor, formerly part of the crew of the [[Stormdancer]], who followed his wife, [[Willow Copperharp]], to join the crew of [[Vindristjarna]]. He is a comic, a joker, good with his hands and the drums, but not always the most subtle or careful with his words. He is a good brewer, and likes a mug of ale and meeting new people.
