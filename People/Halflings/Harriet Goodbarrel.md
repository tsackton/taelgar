Harriet's melodious voice graces *[[The Singing Fox]]* on performance nights, drawing an enthusiastic crowd of locals and passing halflings. Though initially reserved, she truly shines when on stage, and alongside her wife, [[Chenna Goodbarrel|Chenna]], she's made the tavern a warm haven for many.

Harriet married into the [[Goodbarrel]] clan; while she never had her own children, she feels a matronly duty to all the scattered [[Wellby|Goodbarrel youth]].
