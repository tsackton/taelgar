![[pippa-greenbarrow-portrait.png|right|400]]Pippa is a cheerful halfling woman, with a warm, welcoming smile, often seen wearing a wide-brimmed hat. She has a love of good food, great ale, and great company, and attracts like-minded crew to her ship, the [[Summer's Breeze]]. 

She has no fixed route or typical path, but is welcome is every port along the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] and the [[~Emerald Coast~]] for her genial nature, and her tendency to throw impromptu parties on deck.
