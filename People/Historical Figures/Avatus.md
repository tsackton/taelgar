### Emperor Avatus

The ruler of an autocracy established on the southern edge of Sembara in the DR 1420s. Commissioned the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]. 

%% Tim: is he a human or hobgoblin or do you care? I've been thinking of him as a hobgoblin but I'm not sure it matters. He has come up a bunch in my game though so I'd like to decide. 

Don't have strong feelings human vs hobgoblin; feel free to choose, or he could be something else entirely. 

I think the exact history of where this dominion came from can probably be left a bit unclear. I do think the vibe kind of suggests that in the aftermath of the fall of Drankor, Sembara is a bit of a backwater, initially. Especially once the Dunmari arrive in late 1100s and clear up the lingering curse, you have a pretty powerful set of realms from Cymea - Isingue - Dunmar - Chardon. The Skaer in a more raiding phase, and the Dominion of Avatus, really kind of hem in Sembara pre-Derik I.

Mike: He was used as an important historical source in Cleenseau and there are a bunch of hints I dropped that should probably be pulled in, but they could also have been wrong/misinterpreted, someone else/garbled history, etc. 

Only important canonical bit is that he conqueored cleenseau in the 1400s briefly
