%% set as died 1 but a more accurate death date is presumably possible given known to have died in fire war %%

%% a bunch of history connects Mavdyr, the [[Fire War]], and the Chalice of the Runepriest, currently mostly in DM notes and background for Riswynn solo. Leaving as dm_notes: important until this is incorporated. %%

A fire giant, who came out of the east in the early days of the [[Blood Years]], with a large army devoted to him. Defeated outside [[Tokra]] in the [[Fire War]].
