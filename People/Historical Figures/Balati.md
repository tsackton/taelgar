A hero of the Deno'qai during the [[Events/1500s/Great War]], and the man who once bore the armor and shield [[Delwath]] now carries.

He was a young warrior, blessed by [[Nisir]], the tanshi of eagles and far sight, and by [[Yezali]], in his prime. He is said to have been able to sense enemies a mile away, and hunt them with implacable skill. When [[Cha'mutte]]'s forces first probed the defenses of the Red River (the [[K'eye]], the northern of the two rivers that cross what was once the northern edge of the [[Forest of Dreams]]), Balati led the ambush that drove back the [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] vanguard, and his legend grew as it was said he called upon the tanshi to guide his spear and pierced the [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] wizard's heart, killing him dead, from 1000 feet. But no mere mortal could stand against the forces of the [[Abyss]] summoned by [[Cha'mutte]], and Balati fell with many others. It was only by a miracle that Balati's armor was preserved undamaged, blessed by the tanshi.
