### Apollyon

The last emperor of Drankor, who is said to have wanted to become a god. Creator of the [[Things/Artifacts of Power/Scepter of Command]], as well as the [[Mantle of Protection]] and perhaps other artifacts of power. Was a very successful general and commander. 

Originally allied with [[Cha'mutte]], although towards the end of his reign this relationship turned to conflict and when he died, he was imprisoned and prevented from resurrection by [[Cha'mutte]].
