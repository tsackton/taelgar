The founder of the [[House of Sewick]], he established modern Sembara at the [[Treaty of Wisford]] in the fall of 1429 and reigned over a united Sembara and Tyrwingha until his death in DR 1462.

He had five children, and was succeeded by his second son, [[Derik II]].  His third child, Matilda, inherited the Duchy of Telham, and after his reign the Sembaran royalty no longer styled themselves "Dukes of Telham".
