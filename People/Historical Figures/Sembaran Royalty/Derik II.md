The second king of modern Sembara. He reigned from his father's death in DR 1462 until his death in DR 1496. He had three children, and was succeeded by his youngest daughter, [[Charlotte I]].

%% not really clear why Charlotte succeeded as his youngest but he was 38 when she was born so probably not his eldest %%
