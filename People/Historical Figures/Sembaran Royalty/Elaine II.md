%% tagging check/mike, check/tim as I'm not sure we need/want to commit to the dated section, that her reign was a time of peace and prosperity? I agree the vibe of Sembara is clearly fairly stable in the 1720-1749 timeframe, and I think it is sensible to commit to the House of Lis as it stands, but maybe soften the "her reign was a time of peace and prosperity" and the connection to Cece %%

The first monarch of the [[House of Lils]], descended from, Derik, the youngest son of [[Elaine I]], and [[Morgaine]], a Tyrwinghan [[Oracle of the Riven|oracle]].

%%^Date:1722%%
Her reign was a time of peace and prospertity, and an intentional throwback to the glorious years of [[Cece I]]. 

She was succeeded by her son [[Arryn III]]
