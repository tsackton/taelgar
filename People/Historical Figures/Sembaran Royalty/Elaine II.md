## Elaine II
*she/her*, b. 1670, d. 1745

The first monarch of the [[House of Lils]], descended from, Derik, the youngest son of [[Elaine I]], and [[Morgaine]], a Tyrwinghan [[Oracle of the Riven|oracle]].

Her reign was a time of peace and prospertity, and an intentional throwback to the glorious years of [[Cece I]]. 

She was succeeded by her son [[Arryn III]]
