A ruler of Sembara and Tyrwingha. The eldest son of [[Elaine I]] and [[Cynan]]. As a young prince of Tyrwingha, while on a royal tour with his father, he was an early victim of the [[Cursed Cold]], which left the lower half of his body withered and skeletal. His allegiances were more closely aligned with Tyrwingha than Sembara, and he rarely left his palace in [[Tafolwern]]. He was rarely seen without heavy blankets covering his lower body, and he was very self-conscious about his injuries.

Rumors persist in Tyrwingha to this day that he never really died, and instead fled to [[Twilight's Grace]] to seek healing.
