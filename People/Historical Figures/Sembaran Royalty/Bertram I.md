Bertam I, [[Derik III|Derik III’s]] youngest son, came to the throne in December of 1549, a boy of 11. His mother, [[Jane of Tollen]], was appointed regent, and Bertram’s entire kingship is dominated by her, a shrewd woman who disliked waste.

He did not live long enough to have children. He is believed to have died of the effects of the [[Blood Plague]].
