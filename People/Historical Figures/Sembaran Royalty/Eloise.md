The youngest daughter of [[Charlotte I]], she lived a long life and had eight children, who married into many of the noble families of Sembara and Tyrwingha.

Her eldest son, [[Wisym I]], briefly ruled the kingdom after the [[Interregum of 1568]], as a compromise between the warring camps of his cousins, the twin sisters [[Anne]] and [[Elaine I]].
