A king of Tyrwingha who, by marrying [[Elaine I]], reunited the crowns of Sembara and Tyrwingha. He married [[Elaine I]] in DR 1567. 

%% 
No canonical information exists about him; exists to reunite Sembara and Tyrwingha through his children. It is noted in some places that he was known as a great king.
Further development of him should emphasize his joint rule with Elaine and his skill as a king. I suspect he is not the place to sprinkle fey blood or other fey relationships (that shows up in the later [[House of Lils]] via [[Morgaine]]). 

I also suspect he had no great love of Elaine and that they were basically business partners (although ones who respected each other). Potentially a place for bastards/non-recognized kids, although it is long enough ago that it probably doesn't matter.
