An early ruler of Sembara, of the [[House of Sewick]]. She ruled from the death of her father, [[Derik II]],  in DR 1496 until her passing in DR 1519. Her reign is most famous for the heroism of second son, [[Derik III]], who succeeded her to the throne.

Her eldest son, [[Hugh of Sewick]], predeceased her in the chaos of the times, but her youngest, [[Eloise|Eloise]] lived a long life.
