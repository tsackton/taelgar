The second wife of [[Derik III]], from a powerful and rich merchant family in [[Tollen]]. She was Queen Regent in the immediate aftermath of the Great War, and history has not always been kind to her reign. Many consider her short-sighted and overly concerned with promoting her son, [[Bertram I]], at the expense of his older half-siblings, [[Reginald]] and [[Hugh of Sewick|Hugh]]. Others argue that her intelligence and careful stewardship of the throne prevented further deterioration of Sembara in the aftermath of the [[Great War]].

All agree that she was shrewd, at times spiteful, and always economical. She was known for her dislike of waste: wasted effort, wasted money, wasted time.
