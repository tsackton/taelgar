The twin sister of [[Anne]], her disputes with her sister over the throne dominated the 1560s and 1580s.

Elaine spent much of the 1570s in Tyrwingha, and married the King of Tyrwingha, [[Cynan]], thus reuniting the crowns that had been sundered on [[Derik III|Derik III's]] death at the end of the Great War. 

Her three children were: [[Arryn I]], [[Blanche II]], and [[Derik of Lils|Derik]].
