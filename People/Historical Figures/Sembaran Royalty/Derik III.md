The king of Sembara during the [[Great War]]; of the [[House of Sewick]]. He reigned from his mother [[Charlotte I|Charlotte I's]] death in DR 1519 until his death, shortly after the end of the Great War, in DR 1549. 

He is known as one of the greatest kings in Sembaran history, a hero and legendary commander during the Great War, and the savior of his kingdom.

He had two sons ([[Reginald]] and [[Hugh of Wisenfold|Hugh]]) with his first wife, [[Sarabet]], and one son ([[Bertram I|Bertram]]) with his second wife, [[Jane of Tollen]]. 

Mostly due to the influence of his powerful second wife, [[Bertram I|Bertram]] succeeds him upon his death.
