%% probably status/cleanup/text ??%%

The twin sister of [[Elaine I]] and daughter of [[Reginald]], she was executed for treason after attempting to force her sister to abdicate he throne by magic.

Her three children were allowed to live in exile: Wilhema and Eloise in [[Tollen]], and her youngest, Peregrin, in Chardon.

%%% Anne, with stronger ties to the Volta river valley, was proclaimed Queen of Breva 

Some thoughts - I think it works relatively well to have Anne crowned Queen of Breva - the weakest and most closely aligned to Sembara of the highland kingdoms, but basically a weak queen always more interested in pursuing her dynastic claims in Sembara than in governing Breva. She is ultimately a tragic figure and the final geas attempt probably violated Brevan sensibilities quite dramatically, and there were revolts in country against her, as well. 

Perhaps Sembara demands her children be exiled from Breva and give up all dynastic claims to any throne held by the House of Sewick, and the Brevan barons accept these turns, in part because it ends up suited the independence-minded barons

That is, throughout the highland kingdoms in the 1560s-1580s the trend was towards the local barons not seeing the benefits of alliegence ot the Sembaran throne. Breva is the most "Sembaran" of these, and the "loyal to Sewick" barons narrowly overcome the opposition from the "break away" barons in 1568 but Anne's ultimate treason/crimes weakens that faction enough that the "break away" barons win
