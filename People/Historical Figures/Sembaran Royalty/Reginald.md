The eldest son of [[Derik III]] by his first wife, [[Sarabet]]. Although he never reigned, largely due to the influence of [[Jane of Tollen]] to support her son during the chaos of the end of the Great War, he had five children, three of who reigned as monarches.

His children were: [[Bertram II]], [[Blanche I]], the twin sisters [[Elaine I]] and [[Anne]], and [[Gyles of Teckberg|Gyles]].
