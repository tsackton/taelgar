The father of [[Wymar Essford]] and the founder of [[Essford Manor]]. The husband of [[Celine Essford]]. He was granted the lordship of the newly recreated [[Manor of Cleenseau]] for valiant service during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]]. 

He was known as a careful steward of the town, and Cleenseau thrived and grew under his leadership. He was generous with lease terms and other land grants of relatively large and intact buildings in the [[Garrison Quarter]], especially in the 1660s, as a well to reestablish a wealthy clientele in [[Cleenseau]] after the devastation of the wars. 

%% Some hints that he knew [[Essford Manor]] was built on the ruins of a hobgoblin site of mass human slaughter and that he was afraid of the dead and perhaps was responsible for some of the wards beneath Essford Manor %%
