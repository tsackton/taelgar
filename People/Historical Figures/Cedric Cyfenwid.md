A paladin of [[The Wildling]] and friend to the fey, although born in [[Tyrwingha]] he spent much of his life in [[Addermarch]], [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], and the [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]].

%% 
Intended as a vaguely important historical person as an inspiration/backstory figure for [[Robin of Abenfyrd]] but hasn't come up as much as I intended. Either way though should be considered active although there are no details made up about him not in Obisidian shared notes 

The original owner of the [[Lantern of the Bright Hearth]] which was gifted to him by [[Aelirios Sunblade]]
He must have lived before the [[Refuge of the Gossamer Veil]] fell to [[Lord Umbraeth]]. Why he was connected to Amberglow and Aelirios instead of Ethlenn is totally not made up, and could be for any reason at all. Other than a heroic vibe (i.e. he can't have had a secret murder in his background or something) and a lose possibility of him being queer in some fashion (to play to my mostly-queer gaming group) I have no details about him and anything could work.
