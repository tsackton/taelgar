%% Intended as a vaguely important historical person as an inspiration/backstory figure for [[Robin of Abenfyrd]] but hasn't come up as much as I intended. Either way though should be considered active although there are no details made up about him not in Obisidian shared notes 

the original owner of the [[Lantern of the Bright Hearth]] which was gifted to him by [[Aelirios Sunblade]]
