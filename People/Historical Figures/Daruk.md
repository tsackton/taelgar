A dwarven scholar, who lived and died before the [[Events/1500s/Great War]], and was fascinated with lost runic magic. Rumors and tales say he traveled the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild]] and to many other exotic places, seeking to understand how to create runic magic that would permanently change the essence of things. 
%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
[[Agata]], while pretending to be the fey creature [[Typhina]] whiled trapped in the [[Ring of the Warded Mind]], claimed that Daruk created the [[Ring of the Warded Mind]] and gifted it to [[Typhina]] as a present for her aid in helping him understand the nature of the magic of the Heartwood Grove. But whether there is any truth to this story, no one knows.
