![[elder-godfrey-portrait.png|right|400]]Godfrey is an Elder of the Sibyl, strongly blessed and capable of channeling powerful miracles. He is associated with the large Temple of the Sibyl in Tollen. He is a serious, deeply religious man, knowledgable both in the lore of magic and the rituals and miracles of the Sibyl. 

Godfrey grew up in a small village in [[Sembara]]. In his teenage years, it became obvious that he had a powerful and unusual connection to [[the Sibyl]]. He traveled to [[Embry]], and then later to [[Tollen]], where he stayed.
