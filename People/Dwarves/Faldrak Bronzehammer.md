![[faldrak-portrait-1.png|right|400]]Faldrak Bronzehammer is an aged dwarf runecrafter and tinker, with a touch of Feywild whimsy.
## Overview
Faldrak Bronzehammer, with his eccentric blend of traditional dwarven craftsmanship and fey magic, has become a subject of both admiration and curiosity. Born in [[Fahnukan]], a strange northern dwarven kingdom, his life took an unexpected turn during an accidental sojourn in the [[Feywild]]. Although he emerged with peculiar behaviors, his enhanced craft bearing fey enchantments has left many in awe. 
## Description
Despite his aging exterior and graying, rune-braided beard, Faldrak's eyes sparkle with mischief. His wardrobe—a combination of dwarven armor and fey fabrics—reflects his diverse experiences. A small pouch, perpetually moving, is always by his side. He walks with a cane, which seems to be magical and multipurpose. 
## Events

- In DR 1748, during [[Pyravela]] in [[Tollen]], Faldrak attended the party hosted by The Dunmar Fellowship on [[Vindristjarna]], where he met and bonded with Seeker, requesting his aid in journeying to the Edge of Echoes, a mysterious place where the boundaries between the planes (especially between Taelgar and the elemental planes) are thin.
