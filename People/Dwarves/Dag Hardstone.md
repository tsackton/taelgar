Dag is the youngest member of the Hardstone clan, an extended family of dwarves that have lived at and worked for the [[Tokra]] [[Archives]] for generations, helping to maintain the building. 

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
In the summer of 1748 DR, Dag was caught by werewolves when the [[Archives]] were raided, and wounded, becoming cursed by lycanthropy. After he was subdued by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], he was cured by [[Delwath]], with the blessing of [[Yezali]].
