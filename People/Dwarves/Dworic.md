A dwarven smith, born in [[Ardith]] before the [[Great War]]. He was trapped there after the war, but rescued by an expedition sent from [[Nardith]] in DR 1575, led by [[Nora Silverspark|Nora]] Silverspark and [[Hagrim]] Firebrand. Trapped in the [[shadowfell]] realm of [[Bleakhold]] after the rescue mission failed. 

In DR 1748, he was freed from [[Bleakhold]] by [[Riswynn]] and her companions, after the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]] was recovered. Joined the [[Bleakhold]] refugees who traveled with [[Riswynn]] to [[Nardith]], and is now settled there. While time passes differently in the Shadowfell, the years were hard on those trapped there, and he looks his chronological age. 

He has a nervous habit of sharpening his sword to the point of their being no edge at all, which he has found hard to shake even after being freed from [[Bleakhold]].
