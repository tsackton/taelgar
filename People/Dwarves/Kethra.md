![[kethra-final-option1.png|right|400]]Kethra Silverspark, great-grandaughter of [[Nora Silverspark]], is a proud dwarven smith and novice adventurer from [[Tharn Todor]]. 

Inspired by the tales of [[Riswynn]]'s heroic adventures in returning the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]] and putting to rest the ghosts of [[Nora Silverspark]] and [[Hagrim]], among others, she decided to leave home and put herself in Riswynn's service.
