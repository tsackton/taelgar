Part of the group that explored [[Stormcaller Tower]] and brought [[Hralgar's Eyes]] and the [[Binding Stones]] back to [[Chardon]].

%% One Note

**Trait (Aspiration):** to be famous, as discussed below
 
Dwarven Oath of Glory paladin, often found hanging out with Dee Wildcloak.
## Appearance
 
Young dwarf, strong build, buff and athletic. Braided blonde beard, long blond hair in a ponytail. Dresses in traveling clothes usually, or plate armor on adventures. Warrior caste.
## Mannerisms
 
Boastful, but kind of in an awkward teenage way in the sense that he is always like cutting into stories to talk about his deeds / adventures but in a way that often falls flat. But this comes across as charming not annoying, and there is something about him that holds your attention.
 
## Motivation
 
Dain wants to be famous. He grew up in Chardon and the tales the humans tell of the great heroes of the past age are all about humans and elves and even lizardfolk and stranger creatures but never really about dwarves. What’s worse is that the dwarven elders don't seem to care, they just tell there stories of ancient days and never give a second thought to the humans.
 
So he is adventuring to become the dwarven hero for the modern age, the larger-than-life figure dwarven children can look up to and recount the great deeds of Dain Goldhammer.
 
He thought working for the Open Scroll explorer's guild would give him opportunities for glory, but so far it has been disappointing. Fausto (his and Dee's patron) is too secretive, never boasts of their exploits, even asks them to slip in quietly when they return.
