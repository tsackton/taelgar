%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
Captured in battle in May 1748 by [[Dunmar Fellowship]], and interrogated before using magic to convince [[Seeker]] to kill him, seemingly because he insisted he could not die under [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]]'s power. After his death, his body was burned and did not reanimate.
