A young man of 14, current heir to the kingdom. The family resemblance to [[Lubash]] is apparent, but Uzgul is full of the vigor of youth, with a mohawk of wiry black hair, a dangling silver earring on a chain in one ear, and vibrant green skin. He has a nervous excitement to him, and has a hard time sitting still.

%% SECRET

Speaks Common and Sylvan.

Believes the [[Orcs]] of [[Xurkhaz]] can do anything, and will have no sense of the danger [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]] poses.
