Azogar is an old [[Orcs|orc]] loremaster from [[Xurkhaz]], one of the unchained [[Orcs|orcs]] of the [[People of the Rainbow]]. He has dark green skin, which is almost black in patches, and long, but thinning white hair. He is frail and uses a cane to walk. Generally prefers simple robes and understated dress. Although he speaks with a wavering voice, he is clear and precise in this language. 

Azogar is very knowledgable about the history of his people, and can tell many stories of the [[People of the Rainbow]], both before and after the founding of [[Xurkhaz]]. He serves as one of the primary advisors to [[Lubash]], the chief of [[Xurkhaz]].
