An old orc loremaster from Xurkhaz. Dark green skin, almost black in patches. Long, but thinning white hair. Frail, walks with a cane. Wears simple robes. Speaks with a wavering voice, but clear and precise. 

Very knowledgable, can tell many stories and history. Low level wizard magic. Greatly respects [[Lubash]] and will look to him for acknowledgement before revealing anything to outsiders.
