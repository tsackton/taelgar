The formely disgraced Godcaller of the [[Bek'eni]], out of favor due to [[Mezzar]]'s influence. Aided the party in their travels and fights in the [[Elderwood]], and agreed to take charge of rebuilding the relations among the Deno'qai after [[Mezzar]]'s meddling. This seems to be going well, in Oct 1748 at least.
