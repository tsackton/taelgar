The old Godcaller of the [[Te'kula]], who found the fragment of [[Jade]]. Refused to turn it over to [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]], prompting Grimbaskal to attack and Rai and the tanshi [[Aasimti]] to work together to protect the Te'kula in a pocket dimension. 

Some of his stories were recorded by [[Gnaeus]] in [[On the Lost People of the Forests]].
