An elderly woman with stark white hair pulled back in a loose pony tail and wrinkled skin. While she is arthritic and slow, her mind is sharp and she has a clear memory of the stories of her youth, the tales of the Meswati and the [[Great War]]

She is a member of the [[Shu'anra]] tribe, who make their home far to the north, in the [[Forest of Dreams]], between the[[ Blackwater Fens]] and the [[Sentinel Range]]. 

She knows many stories of the northern [[Deno'qai]]: how they were scattered during the [[Great War]]; how her tribe, the [[Shu'anra]], survived the [[Great War]] but fled into the [[Sentinel Range]] during the [[Blood Years]] in the face of [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] armies and [[dragons]]; how her great-grandmother used to tell her tales of dragonfire raining from the sky when no where was safe; how when she was very young, many people ventured forth from the marginal lands the tribe had hidden in, seeking a better life, and how her extended family ended up in [[Elderwood|the Elderwood]]. 

She also knows many tales from the north about the [[tanshi]]: about [[Yezali]], who protected the people of the far north, even further north than her tribe's territory, and other [[tanshi]] called the Meswati who were lost, with [[Yezali]], in the [[Great War]]. The stories of the lost [[tanshi]], she says, are still told in whatever enclaves of [[Deno'qai]] survive beyond the Blackwater Fens, in the northern reaches of the [[Forest of Dreams]].
