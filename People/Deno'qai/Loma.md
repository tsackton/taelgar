Loma is a young Deno’qai scout from the village of [[Raha]], quick and quiet in the woods and familiar with paths along the Sentinel foothills. Locals say she is favored by [[Wenba]], and leaves small offerings before dangerous journeys. 

She is slim, quick on her feet, and wears her red hair long, in tight braids. 
## Events
- (DR:: 1747-11-24) - (DR_end:: 1747-12-03): Guided the [[Silver Tempests]] south from [[Raha]] toward the [[Thordun|western gates]] of [[Am'khazar]]. En route the company investigated nearby [[Tirnessa|elven ruins]] and narrowly escaped banshees before continuing on.
