Lady Eventide is a fey who once held significant influence in [[Amberglow]] as a member of the [[Cloudspinner]]'s court. Now, she remains as one of the few notable fey figures, working diligently to preserve the remnants of the realm.
## Overview

Lady Eventide was once a respected member of the [[Cloudspinner]]'s court. Now, she stands as one of the few prominent fey still residing in [[Amberglow]], striving to protect what little remains of this magical domain. Her home is the ancient cloud palace, which has lost most of its vibrancy.
## Description

Lady Eventide is often seen in ornate courtly gowns adorned with jewelry. However, much like her surroundings, her attire predominantly comprises muted gray and white shades, giving an impression that its colors have been sapped away.
## Events

- In DR 1748, Lady Eventide met [[Seeker]], trading the color from a streak of [[Seeker]]'s hair for a magical [[Sunset Thread|thread]] from her gown, which was crafted by the renowned [[Cloudspinner]], famed for her talent in weaving threads infused with the enchanting colors of the sunset.
