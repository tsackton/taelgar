A fey warrior and knight. The original companion to [[Greymalkin]], and forger of the [[Lantern of the Bright Hearth]].

%% There is some background in [[Greymalkin's Story]] but I haven't really made anything up.  The key vibes of Aelirios are:
* Was a heroic defender of the [[Refuge of the Gossamer Veil]]
* Cared for (at least) one mortal ([[Cedric Cyfenwid]]) - either in a specific way (i.e. they were lovers) or perhaps in a general way (he had some reason to care about Tyrwinghans and/or worshippers of the Wyrdling and/or Cedric did something useful to the Aelirios)
* Died at Umbraeth's hands when Umbraeth conqueored the [[Refuge of the Gossamer Veil]]
* Could have originated as a knight of the Cloudspinner in the 800s or 900s; could have also been a born in the [[Refuge of the Gossamer Veil]] much later, as late as the 1300 or 1400s, although he was clearly powerful, although nothing like an Archfey of course.
* He is not even required to have been the "leader" of the [[Refuge of the Gossamer Veil]], he could have been a lieutant or solider or whatever

In the [[Cleenseau Campaign]] he is intended to be sort of a mythic forefather to [[Robin of Abenfyrd]], and to serve as source, in some mystical way, of Robin's fey-touched feat. He is definitely not alive in any sense, but the idea is that fey might see Robin as a inheritor of Aelirios. He could also be potentially used to drive a question around blocking Umbraeth's plans (i.e. find Aelirios' MacGuffin That Stops Umbraeth's Bad Plan) but I haven't determined anything about that.
