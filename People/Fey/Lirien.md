Lirien is a willowy, flame-haired fae with a presence that flickers between fierce determination and quiet sorrow. Her hair shifts in hue, from the deep gold of sunset to the dying embers of a hearth, its glow dimming or flaring in response to her emotions. Her eyes are a molten amber, catching and reflecting light like polished gold, though in moments of despair, they dull to the color of old brass. She wears a cloak of deep red and umber, tattered at the edges as if burned away by time, and carries a lantern wrought from delicate silver filigree, within which a single, flickering light still struggles to shine. 

She is the last Lanternkeeper of [[Redsun Watch]], a minor member of [[Redsun Watch]], charged with using the [[Amberlight]] to seal cracks in the [[Sunset Gate]] that would sometimes appear from [[Darkfall]]. When [[Redsun Watch]] finally fell, she fled, taking the [[Amberlight]] with her and running to [[Everlight's Bloom]]. 

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
When the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] brought the [[Cloudspinner]] out of [[Cha'mutte]]'s prison on the [[~Circular Island~]], Lirien's [[Amberlight]] flickered to life again, and she left [[Everlight's Bloom]] to search for the [[Cloudspinner]]. She found [[Vindristjarna]], but was tragically killed in an attack by minions of [[Harrow]] and [[Wend]].
