![[areschera.jpg|right|400]]A servant of [[Lord Umbraeth]], and a shapeshifter. Mischievous and cruel, she especially enjoys using her disguises and shapeshifting to bring ruin to mortals.

She was a major villain for two sessions in the Cleenseau campaign, so some color and game mechanics information was developed for that.

She was a key participant in a more complex plot of Umbraeth's which is not captured in Obsidian outside my DM notes, but is not very relevant to her life prior to coming to Veltor (whereabouts dates are accurate)
