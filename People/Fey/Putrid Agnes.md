# Putrid Agnes

>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

Putrid Agnes is a hag with a morbid fascination with beets. She lived for some time on the outskirts of [[Shadowkeep]] under the protection of [[Rhodar von Glauer]], feasting on the minds of those deemed unworthy of being turned to vampire spawn. 

She is rumored to have spend time in Ursk, but was driven out by [[Rodnya Voknaz]] some time ago, and her beet necklace stolen and locked away in [[Voknaz Manor]], which she is desperate to recover. 

She is known for her [[Hush Little Beet|creepy lullabies]].
