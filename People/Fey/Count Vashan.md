>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

Count Vashan, who calls himself by the epithet "The Broken Mask", is a drunken hanger-on in the court of [[Lord Soven]]. He does not recall his origin any longer, and most have ceased to ask, leaving him to his forgetfulness. Persistent rumors claim that he was once a respected member of the [[Cloudspinner]]'s court, long ago.

In a brief moment of lucidity, Count Vashan spoke of how he was once a trusted advisor to the [[Cloudspinner]], but -- whether due to stupidity, or carelessness, or some hidden treachery in his heart, he no longer can recall -- he betratyed her, allowing [[Cha'mutte]] to surprise her in a moment of weakness. Now, he seeks to forget what he did, drowning his past in the wines of [[Sunwine Hall]].
