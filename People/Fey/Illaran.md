Illaran, the guardian of Crystal Peak in the [[Feywild]], is a whimsical fey who wields power over the very stones of his domain.
## Overview

Illaran guards and protects Crystal Peak, a magical fey mountain made of solid crystal between the [[Feywild]] domains of [[Fortune's Rest]] and [[Shimmersong]]. He is known for his curious and innovative nature. He displays a strong connection to the stones of his home, manipulating them with ease.
## Description

Physically, Illaran is dwarf-like: short and stout. His most distinguishable feature is his untamed, vibrant hair that fans out in a frizzy, multi-colored spectacle.
## Events

- During DR 1748, Illaran inadvertently caused a wild magic storm in the [[Feywild]]. [[Seeker]], assisted by two guardians from [[Shimmersong]] and a wandering fey samurai, managed to quell the tempest. Recognizing their efforts, Illaran bestowed upon [[Seeker]] shards of crystallized magic as a token of appreciation.
