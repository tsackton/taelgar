Fascinated by strange magic and collector of magic items, from the common to the extraordinary. 

Thought killed in [[Shakunâ€™s Wellspring]] in [[Session 28]]. Hid in the [[Ring of the Warded Mind]], pretending to by [[Typhina]], for months. She told her tale to Seeker in (check session). 

Until the party brought her to the [[Feywild|Feywild]], where she met her final end imprisoned in [[Session 61]].
