Agata Dustmother, often referred to as the "Old Woman of the Dusts," is an ancient and cunning fey hag, based for many years on the edge of the [[Garamjala Desert]], near [[Eastern Dunmar]]. 
## Overview

Agata Dustmother, known as the Old Woman of the Dusts, is an ancient fey [[Hags|hag]] renowned for her plotting and deal-making skills, who always seems to emerge victorious in her bargains. She has dwelt at the edge of the [[Garamjala Desert]], in [[Eastern Dunmar]], for as long as anyone can remember, luring the desperate and unwary into bargains. She is fascinated by strange and especially gruesome magic, and is a collector of magic items, from the common to the extraordinary. 

In DR 1748, she was imprisoned in the Heartwood Grove in the [[Feywild]] realm of [[Amberglow]] by [[The Dunmar Fellowship]]. 
## Description
![[agata-portrait.png|400]]
Agata takes the appearance of a withered old woman, with dry, dusty skin, wearing white robes. Her lair is magical and seemingly un-scryable hut hidden on the edge of the desert, surrounded by brambles and rocks, and only approachable if one follows the correct path. 
## Events

- Agata was known as Dasoclese in the [[Feywild]] realm of [[Amberglow]]
- Agata was rumored to have been an ally of [[Cha'mutte]] in the [[Events/1500s/Great War]], focusing on the pain of war refugees and survivors. It was suggested by [[Hralgar]] and by [[Delios the Sage]] that she never forgave the Dunmari for their role in the [[Events/1500s/Great War]], and her later actions were often driven by vengeance. 
- In the early 1740s, Agata imprisoned Nayan [[Sura]] in a magic mirror, triggering a chain of events that led to the ascension of [[Nayan Karnas]], [[Sura]]'s brother, to the Dunmari throne, for mysterious ends.
- Acquired the [[Scepter of Command]] from the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] sometime in 1747 or early 1748, in exchange for assisting the Fraternity in their plan to draw the energy of [[Pandemonium]] closer to Taelgar, strengthening the curse of lycanthropy and causing madness to spread across [[Dunmar]]. 
- Thought to be killed by [[The Dunmar Fellowship]] at [[Shakunâ€™s Wellspring]] on [[Session 28 (DuFr)|May 29th, 1748]].
- Masqueraded for months as a fey named [[Typhina]] in the [[Ring of the Warded Mind]], recounting [[Typhina]]'s story to [[Seeker]].
- Was finally imprisoned in the Heartwood Grove in [[Amberglow]] in the [[Feywild]] in [[Session 61 (DuFr)|November 1748]].

## **Other Notes**

- Agata possessed a magical substance called living wood, that she used to turn her victims into wooden puppets and worse. [[Jumi]], [[Cintra]]'s daughter, was in the process of being turned into a wooden mannequin when she was rescued by [[The Dunmar Fellowship]] in [[Session 29 (DuFr)| May 1748]]. Also freed were:
	- [[Garret Tealeaf]], who had been forced into Agata's service as a wooden scarecrow before being turned back by [[The Dunmar Fellowship]] on [[Session 30 (DuFr)|June 2, 1748]]
	- [[Shandar]], an old man who had been trapped as a table for decades, freed by [[The Dunmar Fellowship]] on [[Session 30 (DuFr)|June 4, 1748]]
	- [[Kaya]], a Dunmari woman who had been trapped as a chair for decades, freed by [[The Dunmar Fellowship]] on [[Session 31 (DuFr)|June 8, 1748]]
