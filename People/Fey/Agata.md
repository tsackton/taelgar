A fey creature, a hag sometimes known as the Old Woman of the Dusts. A plotter and dealmaker who always seems to get the better end of the bargain. 

Fascinated by strange magic and collector of magic items, from the common to the extraordinary. 

Thought killed in [[Shakunâ€™s Wellspring]] in [[Session 28 (DuFr)]]. Hid in the [[Ring of the Warded Mind]], pretending to by [[Typhina]], for months. She told her tale to Seeker in (check session). 

Until the party brought her to the [[Feywild|Feywild]], where she met her final end imprisoned in [[Session 61 (DuFr)]].
