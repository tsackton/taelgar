### Typhina

A member of the court of the [[Cloudspinner]], killed by [[Agata]]. 

[[Agata]] later stole her identity and pretended to be her, trapped in the [[Ring of the Warded Mind]], until she was freed in the [[Cosmology/Multiverse/Echo Realms/Feywild/Feywild]] and defeated once again by the party in [[Session 61 (DuFr)]].
