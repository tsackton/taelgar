A fey woman from across the mountains, from the fey realm of [[Dreamhaven]], who has been living in [[Tollen]] for many years, although whether a hundred or a thousand is the matter of much debate. 
## Overview

Caelynn the Seer, a fey woman from the [[Feywild]] domain of [[Dreamhaven]], has lived in [[Tollen]] near the [[University of Tollen]] for an indetermine time -- at least a century, perhaps much longer. She is a mysterious presence, known for prophecy and lore and understanding of dreams, but rarely sharing her vast knowledge without a price of some kind. 
## Description

![[caelynn-portrait.png]]

Caelynn is an elegant elfin woman of ambiguous age, with long silver hair and strikingly vibrant green eyes.  She resides in an unassuming house close to the University. Inside, there's a perpetual feeling of twilight. She often greets guests in a tea room, which boasts a unique circular table, which always seems to have space somehow to accommodate anyone who she invites to sit, while never feeling large. 
## Relationships

- Caelynn is well known across [[Tollen]], although few would consider her even an acquaintance, much less a friend. 
- According to [[Delios the Sage]], the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]] does not appreciate her presence in the city
## Events

- Acquired the "[[Legendary Gates of Kenzo]]" from [[Seeker]] in DR 1748, an adventure story granting readers the freedom to navigate their journey.
