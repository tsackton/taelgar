# Caelynn the Seer

A fey woman from across the mountains, from the fey realm of Dreamhaven, who has been living in Tollen for many years, although whether a hundred or a thousand is the matter of much debate. 

She lives in an elegant house near the University, unassuming on the outside but surprisingly spacious on the inside, with a sense of permanent twilight. She greets people in a small tea room, with a circular table which seems to always have space for one more person, but never feel large.

Many rumors circulate about her:
- she has lived in Tollen since it was founded
- she is just the latest in a long line of fae living as Caelynn
- she is actually the seer who founded the Ancient and Honorable Order of Shanachie (called the Shanachs, a philosopher's guild that supposedly dates to the original settling of Tollen)
- her prophecies always come true
- her prophecies never come true, and ill befalls all who ask a prophecy of her
- she only speaks to those who give her a memory in exchange
- she collects secrets, and will only grant you a boon if you tell her something no one else knows
- she collects secrets, and will only grant you a boon if you gift her a secret, forgetting it in the process

She is knowledgable about many things, often in surprising ways, but rarely, if ever, gives knowledge for free. She is also a powerful magic user, and can dispel enchantments as well as seek information with magic.

In DR 1748, she acquired a book from Seeker, called the Legendary Gates of Kenzo, an adventure story that lets the reader choose their own path through the tale.
