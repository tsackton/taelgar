A fey woman from across the mountains, from the fey realm of [[Dreamhaven]], who has been living in [[Tollen]] for many years, although whether a hundred or a thousand is the matter of much debate. 
## Overview

Caelynn the Seer, a fey woman from the [[Feywild]] domain of [[Dreamhaven]], has lived in [[Tollen]] near the [[University of Tollen]] for an indetermine time -- at least a century, perhaps much longer. She is a mysterious presence, known for prophecy and lore and understanding of dreams, but rarely sharing her vast knowledge without a price of some kind. 
## Description

![[caelynn-portrait.png]]

Caelynn is an elegant elfin woman of ambiguous age, with long silver hair and strikingly vibrant green eyes.  She resides in an unassuming house close to the University. Inside, there's a perpetual feeling of twilight. She often greets guests in a tea room, which boasts a unique circular table, which always seems to have space somehow to accommodate anyone who she invites to sit, while never feeling large. 
## Relationships

- Caelynn is well known across [[Tollen]], although few would consider her even an acquaintance, much less a friend. 
- According to [[Delios the Sage]], the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]] does not appreciate her presence in the city
## Events

- Acquired the "[[Legendary Gates of Kenzo]]" from [[Seeker]] in DR 1748, an adventure story granting readers the freedom to navigate their journey.
## Rumors and Information

Many rumors circulate about Caelynn
- she has lived in [[Tollen]] since it was founded
- she is just the latest in a long line of [[Fey]] living as Caelynn
- she is actually the seer who founded the Ancient and Honorable Order of Shanachie (called the Shanachs, a philosopher's guild that supposedly dates to the original settling of [[Tollen]])
- her prophecies always come true
- her prophecies never come true, and ill befalls all who ask a prophecy of her
- she only speaks to those who give her a memory in exchange
- she collects secrets, and will only grant you a boon if you tell her something no one else knows
- she collects secrets, and will only grant you a boon if you gift her a secret, forgetting it in the process
%% SECRET
- she cannot die: if she is killed she is reborn in the [[Feywild]] and comes back to hunt the one who killed her
- she is a collector of dreams, and those who ask favors of her forget how to dream
- or, conversely, those who ask favors of her suffer unwanted dreams
- she does not eat or sleep and patrols the city as a cat at night, watching people's dreams
- she can see the past and the future, but will never tell which is which
## Roleplaying Notes

- Generally perceived as mysterious, ancient, and secretive
- Unpredictable: Might suddenly favor someone due to a trivial reason, like the color of their aura.
- Vastly knowledgeable with a touch of whimsy.
- Always on the lookout for secrets.
- Tends to speak swiftly, possibly with a lilting, vaguely British accent.
- In interactions, she might require something in exchange for her insights or magical abilities, be it incense, dreams, secrets, or specific magical items. 
- She's known to dispel enchantments: her tea room will automatically dispel any magic of 5th level or low
- While polite, she'll push guests to expedite matters, sometimes hinting at other "obligations" if she is bored with a conversation
- She is knowledgable about many things, often in surprising ways, but rarely, if ever, gives knowledge for free. 
## Secrets

- Despite the air of mystery, she's genuinely interested in helping others.
- Has an uncanny ability to dispel enchantments and seek out information using magic.
- In truth, her stay in [[Tollen]] is driven by the rich vibrancy of [[Humans|human]] life and her fascination with dreams and prophecies.
- Her magic prowess is notable, though she isn't particularly inclined towards combat.
## Other Notes

Caelynn is a fey from across the mountains, who has been living in [[Tollen]] for at least 300 years, but possibly much longer (she is coy about her actual age and history). 

In reality, she is fascinated by dreams and prophecies, and she stays in [[Tollen]] because of the rich vibrancy of the [[Humans|human]] life here. 

She is a powerful magic user, although not particularly combat adept. She can cast legend lore easily enough, and learns more than usual from it, and also remembers quite a bit of lore.
