# Benat
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> A salt [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] (he/him)  
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

A lizardfolk man in the prime of his life, clean blue-green scales, wise eyes, but walks slowly and rubs his hands a lot. Particularly curious about local history. 

Benat serves as an informal liaison between the people of Hamri and the various coastal lizardfolk villages.
