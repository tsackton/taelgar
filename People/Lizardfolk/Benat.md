%% One Note

A lizardfolk man in the prime of his life, clean blue-green scales, wise eyes, but walks slowly and rubs his hands a lot. Has a joint problem that makes him slow and in pain, but deals with it by focusing his curiosity on mysteries.
 
Lives in a small, neat house just above North Dock, near the waterfall on the Mirmir, that has a great terrence with an amazing view. Rarely leaves his house; the town supports him in exchange for the valuable connection to the lizardfolk communities.
 
Knows of Trok, and asked him to send a letter to his family in exchange for help.
