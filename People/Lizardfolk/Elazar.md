## Elazar
(he/him)

A lizardfolk man in the prime of his life, a prophet, seer, and spirit guide who has deeply felt visions and exceptional perception into the spirit realms. [[Kenzo]]’s teacher. A bit of an outcast in his village, seen as someone who sees trouble in everything, although with the recent events in the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]] this reputation is changing.
