![[lizardfolk-erdu.png|right|320]]The spokesperson for the village of [[Ganboa]] when dealing with humans. Older, with graying scales. Has a relatively low opinion of humans, all things considered. His family has lived along the Enst for hundreds of years (he says), and he is skeptical of [[Sembara|Sembaran]] claims to the land.
