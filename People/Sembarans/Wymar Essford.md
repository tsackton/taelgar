### Wymar's Story of Childhood

>[!info] Childhood Story, as told to [[Viepuck]] under the influence of his patron's mind-probe
In his childhood, he recalled overhearing his parents (Reginald and Celine). Reginald was very drunk, and was weeping. Wymar recalls hearing his father sobbing to Celine: "I can't forget it. That day, the bodies just kept walking up out of the tower,Â just below us, and he was grinning even as we struck him down. Mother help me, I want to forget. Sometimes in my dreams I still see it. Was it wrong to build here? Is this place cursed?".
