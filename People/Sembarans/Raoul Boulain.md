Excluded / not escalated: Brainstorming design docs and speculative DM planning notes about phylactery dungeons (non-diegetic), any causal amplification of magic beyond explicit text, unrecorded strategic councils.

Raoul Boulain was a Sembaran cleric of [[The Night Queen]] recognized as an Elder during the latter phase of the lich crisis. He publicly revealed that the figure acknowledged as King [[Robert I]] had already died and been supplanted by the lich [[Malach]]. Not long after, royal proclamations named him (with [[Lenora Belles]]) among wanted Night Queen elders. Earlier he had cast a great ward (identified by witnesses as a Forbiddance) at the battle outside Fellburn, and he was later described as the “terrifyingly” or “mega‑powerful” cleric whose presence and blessings steadied allied forces. His retinue included the lay bodyguards [[Julien Marteau]] and [[Sveta Dragunov]], and the disciple Yolande Leclair; he operated in close coordination with the paladin Lenora.

In the field Raoul conjured a compact, warded temple for secure counsel, briefed trusted agents that Malach had divided its phylactery into three concealed parts, and coordinated parallel efforts to recover and destroy them—directing others to claim the fragment hidden in the barony while allied parties pursued the remaining two. Accounts note his interest in unusual undead remains (such as a great eel corpse moved to the Night Queen’s temple in Rinburg). A recovered fragment was later delivered back to him and Lenora before the final push. He is recorded as dying on DR 1720-03-20 in the concluding confrontation with Malach.
