The heir of [[Sarabeth Asa]] and biological child of the Valbert family in Embry. He disappeared, along with his three grown children, in 1715. His father's family inherited the [[Manor of Asineau]] on his disappearance after a lengthy legal dispute, and ended up nominating a cousin, [[Lorin Valbert]], for lord.
