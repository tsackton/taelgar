![[marguerite-deschamps.png|right|320]]The chief clerk of the Barony of Aveil, she is originally from [[Rinburg]] and her family has longstanding ties to the [[Duchy of Wisford]]. Her appointment was widely seen as an attempt to ensure the [[d'Aslains]] did not dominate the barony for their own benefit.

The real Marguerite Deschamps was killed by [[Areschera]] on January 2nd 1720. Since then, Areschera has been working to undermine the barony's response and win points in her fey competition.

Her two assistants:  Gracien and Martine were both killed in an unlucky zombie attack on the road between Veltor and Cranmere a few days after Marguerite fell ill.
