![[thomas-dyerson.png|right|200]]One of three assistants to [[Victorine Rosseau]], Thomas is an important magistrate in the [[Barony of Aveil]] and often travels to investigate and adjudicate crimes on behalf of the Barony. He is dedicated to his job, if a bit uncreative, and willing to look beyond the obvious when pushed.
