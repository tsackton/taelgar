![[sabine-de-brune-valit.png|right|320]]The aging castellan of [[Valit]], a vassal of the [[Baron of Aveil]]. Organized about managing the manor, but with a soft spot for bardic tales and romance. Never married, although is rumored to have had several great loves in her youth. She is also the magistrate for the village of Valit.

The de Brune family has long roots in the Cleenseau family and owns extensive land across all four of the manors in the region. Recently, the family under [[Catherine de Brune]] has grown to include some mercantile interests.
