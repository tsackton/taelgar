%% end date of Valit needs to be confirmed with session notes for Cleenseau - when she left Veltor %%

![[sabine-de-brune-valit.png|right|320]]The aging castellan of [[Valit]], a vassal of the [[Barony of Aveil|Baron of Aveil]]. Organized about managing the manor, but with a soft spot for bardic tales and romance. Never married, although is rumored to have had several great loves in her youth. She is also the magistrate for the village of Valit.

The de Brune family has long roots in the Enst river valley, and although [[Eskbridge]] is their primary area of operations, there are several outposts along the Enst including a longstanding one in the Cleenseau region. Recently, the family under [[Catherine de Brune]] has grown to include some more diverse mercantile interests in this region.

She was appointed as the castellan by [[Reginald Rusebek]] and still feels disgust and guilt that she was such a loyal supporter of his. She doesn't like to talk about baronial affairs much, and focuses on the village and doing her duties diligently. 

%%^Date:1720%%
In early February of 1720, she was summoned by [[Isabeau D'Aslain]] to [[Veltor]] and never returned to [[Valit]]. Although the reasons for her disappearance are unclear, rumors suggest that her health is poor and she returned to Eskbridge to die.

%%^Campaign:clee%%
For much of the fall and winter of 1719, Sabine was the host to [[Istarias]], the Squire of the Whispering Wind, who was on a mission from his lord, [[Lord Serenveil]], to make sure Celyn made it to [[Cleenseau]] and stayed in the region. Who sent Istarias and why remains a mystery. 

Sabine and Istarias fled towards Tywingha after escaping from [[Areschera]] (who was really the one who had summoned them) with the help of the [[Merriweathers]] and the [[Heroes of Cleenseau]].

%%^Campaign:None%%
Istarias was sent by his lord as a favor to [[Archfey Ethlenn]], who had a prophecy or foretelling that Celyn would save [[Elaine II]] if he grew attached to [[Cleenseau]].
