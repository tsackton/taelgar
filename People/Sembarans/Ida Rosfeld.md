![[ida-rosfeld.png|right|320]]Ida is the captain of the [[Army Garrison of Cleenseau|Cleenseau Garrison]] of the [[Army of the West]]. She is a no-nonsense commander who respects very few people other than [[Rosalind Essford]] and is known for her sharp tongue.

%%^Campaign:clee%%
Since the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]] she has created an independent force based around the [[Army Garrison of Cleenseau]], much augmented by local recruits, and has worked closely with the [[Heroes of Cleenseau]] to defend the Cleenseau region.

She has moved the garrison to [[Asineau]] which has become something of a base of operations for defense and patrol activities in the region.
