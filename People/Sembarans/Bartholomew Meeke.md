# Bartholomew Meeke
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> A [[Humans|human]]


%% 
A tin trader who had left the northern Aveil region before Vitalae, and was spending the quite period in Aslain. 
Left for Rinburg after Quintarum and was captured by fey dude ; one of his first enchantment attempts - a learning exercise - which he has since perfected, and the stream of false messengers is going to start heading out soon

Some more info in my head from the sessionwhere PCs met him that is crucial to his character; premetively setting DM notes no as once the minimal details are
