![[mabel-cleenseau.png|right|320]]The granddaughter of [[Nicholas the Beggar]], her family died in a winter illness in 1702, and for a while she was a scullery maid at the [[Essford Manor]]. But sleeping in the kitchens gave her nightmares, she said, of bones and she left after a few years. Always a bit of a loner, she prefers to sleep outside, and ended up living with and taking care of her grandfather in [[Beggar's Way]]. She eked out a living for the two of them fishing and gathering herbs for [[Alain LeBouillon]], and learned the lands around [[Cleenseau]] well. She has a fierce streak and a strong temper, and has not done well with steady employment.

During the [[Battle Against Wakog]] she volunteered to help scout.

%% Note: The reference to "nightmares of bones" is a hint that she knew there were skeletons under Cleenseau and that perhaps she might have some small magical gift; nothing came of it in the Cleenseau game though %%
