A prominent merchant in [[Cleenseau]], his grandmother, [[Lizette Ausson]], traces her family to [[Isingue]] and he and his wife Alessia are the heart of a small community of Isinguen transplants in [[Cleenseau]]. He is well connected with the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] and well known to the merchant caravans that come from places like [[Laicon]] with recovered dwarven metals. 

He remains close to his aunt, [[Giselle Ausson]], who runs [[Ausson's Crossing]], and important inn in [[Laicon]].
