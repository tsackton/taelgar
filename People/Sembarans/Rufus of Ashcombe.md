%%
- Rufus, Alban's adopted son and apprentice. A transman, from one of the small villages along the Enst, who doesn't speak about his family background. Learning rapidly from his adopted father and clearly the next generation of local knowledge, although some say he has a dark anger about him sometimes. Unclear if he has the temperment to take over the temple administrator, butÂ  Alban doesn't have a better candidate (yet).
