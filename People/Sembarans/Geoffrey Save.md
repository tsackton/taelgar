![[geoffrey-save.png|right|320]]A compatriot of [[Rinault Essford|Rinault]], his family came to [[Cleenseau]] when he was a young boy as part of [[Wymar Essford|Wymar's]] efforts to attract a larger market population. Recently inherited a thriving brewery and bakehouse from his parents at an unexpectedly young age, and also a significant landlord in [[Underhill]]. 

His wife Annabelle, has been ill frequently, and miscarried twice recently. Geoffrey has spent much time with [[Rinault Essford|Rinault]] instead of caring for his holdings, and often talks about how his family is cursed. His brother Jacques and his brother's husband, Ari have recently taken over the bakehouse and brewery, leading Geoffrey to complain even more to whoever will listen.
