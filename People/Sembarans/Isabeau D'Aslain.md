![[baroness-isabeau.png|right|320]]The baroness of the [[Barony of Aveil]]. 

%% 
Just a name for the current Baron -- and a note, sheâ€™s newly appointed this spring after the old baron was charged with treason (for embezzling crown funds) and executed 
old Baron was Reginald Rusebek
Current thinking is that the old baron was actually a "good guy" and killed by the lich; whether Isabeau is working with him, a dupe, or something else is not clear

She became baron in April 1719, so ~10 months ago.
Rosalind never had any complaints about her, and until the undead rising no one would have thought to describe her as "ignoring" Cleenseau, just... preoccupied elsewhere. Or a "big picture" sort of person.

Sabine de Brune (the catellan of Valit, a baronial manor) was in regular contact with the baroness' household for various management things. But since the undead rising she has been a lot more scarce

Brother: Giles who has several children, two of whom she is fostering as heirs

the current Baroness, Isabeau d'Aslain, is from a large merchant household in Aslain, which several lordships and manorial holdlings across central Aveil, and was chosen by the king as something of a compromise "steady hand" type new baron
This Baroness seems to be more of the delegating type. A letter giving Rosalind the authority to appoint all magistrates in Cleenseau, no need to tell me who.
And no invitation to her investiture (whereas a more normal baron might have invited two dozen important manoral lords to come throw them a party when they take the baron-ship)
 So it isn't _mismanagement_ all the proper forms are followed, it just isn't good management

Sabine - who you probably talked to in the aftermath of Asieneau being abandoned - had the sense that she just doesn't leave Veltor much, and is probably ignoring the whole barony equally.

Baroness household:
* [[Isabeau d'Aslain]]
* captain of her guard ([[Thomas Dyerson]]) (m)
* chief magistrate of barony [[Victorine Rosseau]] (f)
* chief clerk of the barony [[Marguerite Deschamps]] and her two assistants
* secretary ([[Robin D'Aslain]]) (m)
* chamberlain ([[Perette]]) (f)
* steward ([[Emeric]]) (m)
* captain of the horse [[Marceline Dupont]] (f)
