![[gisele-ausson.png|right|320]]The youngest of [[Lizette Ausson|Lizette's]] children, a seamstress, weaver, and childminder. She is the youngest daughter of Lisette and Roland was widowed and never remarried in 1687 when the shaking fever gripped [[Ausson's Crossing]] and killed her husband Matthieu. She is a seamstress, weaver, and cook, and clearly loves children, and has run the inn in [[Laicon]] for several years.

Her son Pierre is her constant companion, and she is the teacher and surrogate mother for many of her nieces and nephew and now grandchildren. She keeps in touch with a wide range of Isinguens across [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], [[Sembara]], and even as far north as [[Tollen]].
