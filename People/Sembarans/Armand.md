![[armand-night-queen-new.png|right|400]]A warrior and disciple of the Night Queen. 

%% Meta: 3rd-5th lvl cleric of the Night Queen 
a miracle worker and disciple of the Night Queen. He is quiet most of the night, and the only one of the group not part of the Rangers. He seems much more deeply worried about the undead events than anyone else. He is originally from Embry, and does know of a paladin, Lenora Belles, who seems likely to be the woman who saved Viepuck several years ago. She is deep in the councils of the Night Queen these days. Last time he was in Embry (about five or six weeks ago), she was out of town, he didn't know where or why.%%

%% Backstory notes. None of it really came up the day I was playing him, up to you want to incorporate

basic outline of Armand backstory:

- mother was from Fellburn, fled the sack (probably around 11-12) but was separated from her family, ended up in Embry, found her way onto a ship and became a sailor
- father from local middle class Embry family, maybe a scribe or something
- grew up with mostly absent mother, but always eager to hear stories of the sea, and her stories of Fellburn
- as soon as he was old enough, left home to become a sailor, and traveled on merchant ships around the Green Sea
- was a sailor for several decades, into his 40s or so
- maybe 6-7 years ago, something happened; not sure exactly what yet, but something to do with undead that (a) triggered / opened his mind to latent divine magic and (b) left him deeply concerned with protecting the world from the wandering dead
- returned to Embry and became an acolyte at temple of Night Queen, practicing magic and learning about undead

tim: Early Dec sometime (5-6 weeks ago, per your comment in Armand's obisidan note), he left Embry based on bad premonitions about undead and such. Reaches Wisford and then heads upriver, towards Gowerbourne and eventually aiming for Ainwick. This could be (a) on orders of the temple in Embry, if there is an organized effort to send people investigating premonitions; (b) because he knows someone he wants to connect with, someone with Night Queen connections he feels might have insight; (c) perhaps because of dreams / visions. Probably (b) is cleanest but I don't know the relevant context. 

It is ~250 miles from Wisford to Ainwick, so say is not pushing hard and gets there in ~2 weeks, mid/late December. Spends Pyravela in Ainwick. It is only 50-60 miles from Ainwick to the Aveil Hills, so when rumors reach him in Ainwick (maybe Jan 6-7) of undead, he heads south, hurrying, reaching Aveil Hills perhaps in 2 days, by Jan 8-9. (note this requires delaying the emergence of Ainwick undead so he has left by the time they emerge, or deciding this didn't happen) In Aslain, rumors are flying about all kinds of badness, mostly to the south, so he heads south. At this point, probably trying to get to Fellburn and help there, but hears of the lake monster in Rinburg and does not think he can face it alone, so swings west to gather news and hopefully allies. At that point, either meets Vahaiya and their crew in Eftly and helps with the monster there, or ends up in Champimont looking for news and allies heading east.

mike: actually think it works better if he is local to Aveil in the Jan 5-8th timeframe. What if instead of going up the Wistel, he ends up in Aveil. Same idea (seeking a recluse/hermit type) but this person lives in the eastern eaves of the Cleenseau Wood, a bit upriver from Aslain say

For him, the undead outbreak starts with a few zombies arising in the village next door, or whatever, and for ~3-4 days he is busy in the local area around just helping folks. Around Jan 10th he hears of (a) some trouble in the Aveil Hills (b) the siege of Fellburn And he dithers for a bit but ultimately is compelled to head towards Fellburn. He heads south along the Auberonne

But before he reaches Rinburng, he gets pulled along a series of villages with problems and ends up finding it faster to get back on track by heading due south from some village west of the Auberonne, which puts him smack into Eftly. He basically runs into Vahayia and their group hunting the ghast just outside Eftly
