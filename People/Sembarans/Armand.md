![[armand-night-queen-new.png|right|400]]A warrior and disciple of the Night Queen. 

%% Meta: 3rd-5th lvl cleric of the Night Queen 
a miracle worker and disciple of the Night Queen. He is quiet most of the night, and the only one of the group not part of the Rangers. He seems much more deeply worried about the undead events than anyone else. He is originally from Embry, and does know of a paladin, Lenora Belles, who seems likely to be the woman who saved Viepuck several years ago. She is deep in the councils of the Night Queen these days. Last time he was in Embry (about five or six weeks ago), she was out of town, he didn't know where or why.%%
