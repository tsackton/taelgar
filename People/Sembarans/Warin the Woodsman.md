![[warin-the-woodsman.png|right|320]]A tracker and woodsman from [[Valit]], and confidant of [[Sabine de Brune]].

%%^Campaign:clee%%
He has helped the [[Heroes of Cleenseau]] several times, both as a tracker in the forest hunting giant spiders, and as a a leader during the [[Battle Against Wakog]]. He is skilled with a bow, but comes across as no-nonsense, all-business and never talks about his personal life.
