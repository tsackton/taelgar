Reginald Rusebek was charged with treason & murder in February 1719. He was embezzling crown funds and was found to have murdered a group of halfling traders who discovered his embezzlement. . His family (three children, a sister and brother-in-law, two nieces, a niece-in-law, and his wife) was never found to be complicit, but there were suspicions from some of the halflings that his nephew and daughter were involved in at least the cover up. 

At least partially to appease the hafllings, the whole family was declared unable to inherit, and the Rusebeks mostly ended up leaving Sembara for Maseau.
