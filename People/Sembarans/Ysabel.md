A striking and comely woman with a rough scar running from her eye to her neck. She is the sheriff of [[Cleenseau]] and leads a part of the [[Lord's Guard of Cleenseau|Lord's Guard]]. She has many opinions about her employers, in particular [[Rinault Essford]], and does not always successfully keep them to herself.
