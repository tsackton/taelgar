Lorin Valbert is the lord of [[Asineau]]. He is the second cousin of the old lord, Robert Assante, who was much beloved before his death in 1715. Lorin did not expect to inherit a manorial lordship, and regards it as beneath his station, being a backwater far from the centers of power. 

%%^Campaign:Clee%%
During the [[Battle Against Wakog]] he was notably unhelpful and did not wish to strip his manorial guard to aid the attack on [[Wakog|Wakog's]] camp.
