![[lorin-valbet.png|right|320]]Lorin Valbert is the lord of [[Asineau]]. He is a cousin of the old lord, [[Lucas Asa]] ,via Lucas' biological father. Lorin did not expect to inherit a manorial lordship, and regards it as beneath his station, being a backwater far from the centers of power. 

He has a wife and two young children who often reside in [[Embry]].

During the [[Battle Against Wakog]] he was notably unhelpful and did not wish to strip his manorial guard to aid the attack on [[Wakog|Wakog's]] camp.
