A lumberjack and leading person in [[Ashcombe]]

%% Notes from session
one of the main lumberjacks in ashcombe, and effectively the steward/"union boss", who is still upset about his missing husband. He is caring but a bit headstrong.

His husband taken by fey; leading figure in the aftermath; some more notes in my email
