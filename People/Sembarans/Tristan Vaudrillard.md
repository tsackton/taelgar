![[tristan-vaudrillard.png|right|400]]A devotee of [[The Sibyl]] and student of magic.

%% Meta: a 4th or 5th level divine soul sorcerer 
a strange man, fascinated by tales of magic, with compelling eyes and a deep presence_._ He seems young at first - he doesn't look more than 20 or 25 - but the more you talk to him, the odder his stories seem. He grew up in Tyrwingha, in Tafolwern, he says, but in the course of your talking about home, he talks about one of his earliest memories, the birth of Cece I's youngest daughter - which happened 57 years ago. When Izgil, at one point, starts talking of the moon, he is clearly interested. He is devoted to the Sibyl, and she and her guidance often feature in his stories. He has travelled with Vahaiya before.

additional notes from email convo:
- strange memories are not his, they are fragments of other people's memories, either devoted worshippers of the Sibyl who have since died and somehow the Sibyl's power flowing through him also leaks the memories of souls she has brought to her realm; or they are previous divine soul sorcerers who are linked in some mystical way to him; or perhaps something else, the vibe is these strange memories are intrusive
- left home around 14/15, after something not-yet-determined happened to trigger his magic ability
- spent time in Tollen, trying to understand his power (vibe is that his power was somewhat / completely unwanted), from ~1715 - 1717. Met [[Godfrey of Marburgh]] there. 
- left after gaining some measure of control around 1717, at some point later connecting with the Rangers
