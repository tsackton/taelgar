![[anselm-portrait.png|right|320]]The temple administrator of the [[Temple of the Warlord in Cleenseau|Temple of the Warlord]] in [[Cleenseau]]. An ambitious man and not very religious.

%% 
In recent Clee sessions he has become involved in the administration of Asieneau after the departure of [[Lorin Valbert]], and he has been debated as someone who could potentially become castellan. In general, there has been a roleplaying vibe of him wanted to find ways to have more power, as well as some backstory where he is close to [[Wymar Essford]] but not his daughter. %%
