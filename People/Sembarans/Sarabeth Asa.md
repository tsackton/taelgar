 The manor here and the village was refounded just after the war, by Lady Sarabeth Asa. I think I've told you her story before? She was from a small village in the Mostreve Hills, near the source of the Clavert River, in the Barony of Brumecliff. When she was granted this manor, a number of refugees from her old village settled here, including my mother. We brought with us the memories of the Wyrdling, from our old village, and still remember their miracle here, each September.
