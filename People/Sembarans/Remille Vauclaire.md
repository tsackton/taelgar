%% 
Meta: lowish level fighter 
a quiet woman, who barely talks to you but spends most of the time watching the room, watching for danger, watching you, watching Vahaiya. She is also from Adderfell, you learn (from Emilie), and is a patient teacher and skilled swordswoman

She spent some time in the guerilla caves in the [[Aveil Ridge]] helping [[Tristan Vaudrillard]] and [[Damien Montrichard]] deal with zombies in the caves. Not clear what happened to her after that or when she left
