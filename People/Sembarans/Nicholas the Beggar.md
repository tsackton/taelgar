An old man with a thick grey beard, a beggar who lived in the ramshackle Beggar's Way outside of [[Cleenseau]]. His body was found in the [[Cleansing of the Ettercap Lair]] by [[Viepuck|Najeer]], [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil]], [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]], and [[Celyn]]. He was believed to have been killed by spider's on or around October 14th.
