### Jonathon's History Lesson
Before [[Cleenseau - Session 08]] Jonathon shared several facts and stories about Cleenseau:
- The hobgoblins occupied Cleenseau during the 3rd Hobgoblin War and built a motte and bailey castle / fortification here, but it was destroyed except for the actual hill of the motte by Cece's troops but a lot of rubble was left behind 
- Cleenseau was an army camp for a couple of years in the 1649 - 1651 period while Cece was still fighting the hobgoblins to the south.
- There are probably some records or information about this war hidden away in the garrison
- Essford Manor was built by [[Reginald Essford]] shortly after he became lord in the early 1650s on top of the hobgoblin-built motte  
- Underhill (the poor neighborhood where Tumbledown Manor is) was mostly built on top of the ruins of the hobgoblin fort in the 1660s and 1670s as the town grew.
