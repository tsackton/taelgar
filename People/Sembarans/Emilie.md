![[emilie-adderfell.png|right|400]]A fighter.

%% a brash young woman, full of vim and vigor and bravado. She talks of her home -- Adderfell, the main city of Addermarch -- frequently, and her large family. She is starstruck by Robin in particular, and talks of awe about Vahaiya as well. She takes to Odo immediately, and bonds with him (quite platonically) over being amongst such amazing heroes. She tells you this is her first time outside of Addermarch, and she seems fascinated by the new places and people. Her prized possession is her axe, which she calls Sharp Justice, and which features prominently in various stories.

Some roleplaying and color notes from the Cleenseau session she was an NPC to incorporate
