Elbeth, a younger woman, not quite 30. She came to the village from Embry with Lord Valbert, and no one in the village knows her that well. She is aloof and withdrawn most of the time. She has broken off three engagements with various men in the village, and is rumored to spend a lot of her free time watching the lizardfolk in Ganboa, and has been heard to express a desire to see fairies, or elves. Skilled with a sword, the best fighter of the three guards.
