A transman who lived in [[Underhill]], he was killed by a zombie during the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]] along with his unborn child. He lived at [[Tumbledown Farm]], and was quiet and preferred the company of his husband (a solider in the [[Army Garrison of Cleenseau]]) to large groups. 

He was found near [[Auloutte]] by [[Gideon Thorne]] and some other fishers.
