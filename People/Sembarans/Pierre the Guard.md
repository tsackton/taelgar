# Pierre the Guard
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

%% guard who the PC convinced to lie to help them smuggle Sabine de Brune out of the Veltor castle. Bit of a dwarf fanboy in that he likes stories about them, admires, them etc. 
Really proud to have helped "the heroes of Cleenseau"
