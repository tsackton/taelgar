A newcomer to town and acolyte of the Night Queen. Eremon is well-travelled and a personal friend of [[Rosalind Essford|Rosalind's]]. He walks with a pronounced limp.  He was from [[Fellburn]] originally and left shortly after [[Cece I]] died. What he has been doing for the last seven years is not clear.
