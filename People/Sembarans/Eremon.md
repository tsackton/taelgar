He was from [[Fellburn]] originally and left shortly after [[Cece I]] died. What he has been doing for the last seven years is not clear.

A few notes on him - he is the one that was dreaming of the Redcap, and also who signed Rosalind's letter with a PS. He was the one who told you about Wymar and about a dozen other border lords all getting dementia around Mar/Apr of this year, and he clearly thought it was suspicious. He came to Cleenseau shortly afterwards. He is currently with Rosalind and always stayed a little out of the spotlight, so you don't have as good a sense of him as some of the other folks in Rosalind's orbit. He seemed have had a change of heart or other desire to bring you more fully into his council's after the redcap dreams, but he left with Rosalind almost immediately after that. You could write him a letter though.
