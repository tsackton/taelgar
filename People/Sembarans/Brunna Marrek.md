%% tagging status/check/mike for metadata and header %%

Gruff woman who runs the Granite Mug in Veltor. Fond of gossip and quick to lean on a heavy wooden ladle she keeps at hand. Known to be practical, not especially trusting of nobility, and surprisingly well-informed about local guard movements. Often referred to simply as "the proprietor" in passing notes.
