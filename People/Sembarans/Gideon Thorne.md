![[gideon-thorne.png|right|320]]A fisherman and the most prominent person in the small hamlet of [[Auloutte]]. Much of his family lives in the North Close of Cleenseau, including his son [[Gabriel Thorne]] and his nephew [[Jon Thorne]]. He lives with his two grown daughters and their families, both of whom are also fisherfolk. 

He knows the river well, and is an admirer of the lizardfolk of [[Ganboa]]. He went with [[Rinault Essford|Rinault]] on his ill-advised trip searching the river after the [[Tragic Flood of the River Enst]].
