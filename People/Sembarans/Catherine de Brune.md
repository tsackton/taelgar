![[catherine-de-brune.png|right|320]]The cousin of [[Sabine de Brune]] and an trading agent for a number of Embry trading families, including the [[Garay Family]]. She is a confidant of [[Rinault Essford|Rinault]] and it is a rather open secret that she has an on-again, off-again affair with him.

Her husband Emmanuel is a doting father to their four children, and somewhat bookish.
