![[catherine-de-brune.png|right|320]]The cousin of [[Sabine de Brune]] and an trading agent for a number of Embry trading families, including the [[Garay Family]]. She is a confidant of [[Rinault Essford|Rinault]] and it is a rather open secret that she has an on-again, off-again affair with him. She has bought numerous landholdings in [[Asineau]] from [[Lorin Valbert]], but is concerned at his mismanagement and questioning whether it is a profitable investment.

Her husband Emmanuel is a doting father to their four children, and somewhat bookish, but their relationship seems cool at best.

%% Nothing about the de Brune's is canon, could use a crosscheck here against what you have invented. In particular, she could just be a trading agent for her own family interests rather than the Garays %%

%%^Campaign:Clee%%
Her husband enjoys discussing books and the moon with Izgil. She also was interested in discussing business with Viepuck, and appreciated the opportunity to talk, rather than just be asked for things.
