%% Per [[de Brunes]] note, I would actually leave her as a trading agent for other families, which would set up the de Brunes to have grown from reasonably wealthy and well-connected in 1705-1720 to famous and very rich in 1730-1745. I kind of like the trajectory of them being relatively "new rich" and upwardly mobile but not necessarily having very ancient wealth; this works for Nathaniel's backstory as he tends to play Fazoth more as "famous for being rich" than "rich because they are famous/old" %%

![[catherine-de-brune.png|right|320]]The cousin of [[Sabine de Brune]] and an trading agent for a number of Embry trading families, including the [[Garay Family]]. She is a confidant of [[Rinault Essford|Rinault]] and it is a rather open secret that she has an on-again, off-again affair with him. She has bought numerous landholdings in [[Asineau]] from [[Lorin Valbert]], but is concerned at his mismanagement and questioning whether it is a profitable investment.

Her husband Emmanuel is a doting father to their four children, and somewhat bookish, but their relationship seems cool at best.

%%^Campaign:Clee%%
Her husband enjoys discussing books and the moon with Izgil. She also was interested in discussing business with Viepuck, and appreciated the opportunity to talk, rather than just be asked for things.
