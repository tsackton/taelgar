![[catherine-de-brune.png|right|320]]The cousin of [[Sabine de Brune]] and an trading agent for a number of Embry trading families, including the [[Garay Family]].

Her husband Emmanuel is a doting father to their four children, and somewhat bookish, but their relationship seems cool at best.

#### Roleplaying Notes
She is sharp, charming, and beautiful, and resents being dismissed as a trophy or pretty head, but also not afraid to use sexuality to get what she wants. She secretly wishes she had more opportunity to prove herself, and resents somewhat her growing family connections, but is too attached to wealth and prominence, and the ability to do what she wants, to truly set off on her own or do anything other than play her part.
