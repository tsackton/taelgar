Known as the Queen of Ships, she lives with her partner Iesha on Glittercliff. Owns a large fraction of the fishing fleet of [[Hamri]], and is the most important boat builder in the region. She inherited and greatly expanded the family business and has been a fixture in Hamri for many decades. She also owns the North Dock, and makes a good profit from the rents collected for tie ups here. She controls a tollhouse (known as Sulifi's Tollhouse) on the North Dock and pays for guards that collect rents and walk the dock at night.
