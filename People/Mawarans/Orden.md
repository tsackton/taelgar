Orden is a beach bum of sorts, who lives in a shack on the beach,  north of the main port of [[Hamri]]. While he came from wealth, something happened that he refuses to talk about, and he now ekes out a living on salvage and what fish he can catch. He is short and stocky, with great bushy hair and a bushy beard, with many piercings and proud eyes. 

He is a friend of [[Trok]]; they often work salvage together, and sometimes smoke [[gatza]] on the beach late at night, each seeking their own solace. 

He is also [[Hiyasa]]'s father.
