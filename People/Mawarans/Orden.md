Orden is a beach bum of sorts, who lives in a shack on the beach,  north of the main port of [[Hamri]]. While he came from wealth, something happened that he refuses to talk about, and he now ekes out a living on salvage and what fish he can catch. He is short and stocky, with great bushy hair and a bushy beard, with many piercings and proud eyes. 

He is a friend of [[Trok]]; they often work salvage together, and sometimes smoke [[Gatza]] on the beach late at night, each seeking their own solace. 

He is also [[Hiyasa]]'s father. 

%% One Note

A friend of Trok's, a beach bum who lives in a shack north of the main port of Hamri.
 
Short and stocky, great bushy hair and beard, piercing proud eyes. Many piercings. Orden was born a prominent local family but is now an outcast living on the beach. He was a rebellious youth, shipped out as a teen with some "merchants" who turned out ot be mercenaries or maybe just pirates, narrowly escaped, joined a criminal gang to survive for a while in a nearby coastal city, and later returned to Hamri, hoping to be welcomed by his family, but they rejected him. He subsists on what the ocean offers, or what he can beg or maybe steal, and fraternizes with the local lowlifes.  Trok and Orden sometimes work salvage together, and often smoke gatza on the beach late at night, each seeking their own solace.
 
Has a daughter, Hiyasa, who returned to Hamri in early October and vanished treasure hunting in the interior.
