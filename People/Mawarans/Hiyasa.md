%% Tim needs to incorporate notes from OneNote, has some backstory that connects to Chardon that I like %%

Daughter of [[Orden]], recently returned from 10 years away with a treasure map, possibly stolen from Chardon or Chardonians in some way. Promptly headed for one location, got stuck, and then rescued by the PCs.

%% One Note

Orden's daughter. Thief of some skill, recently returned from "away" with stolen maps, presumably acquired from Chardonians although exact details as yet unrevealed.
 
Rescued from the tomb of Yerkir-Khor by the party in Episode 3.

Hiyasa, daughter of Orden, returned home destitute a few weeks ago, had been traveling for the past 10 years or so at least. Came with rumors and information but no money. Finding Orden in his current state, vowed to do something about it.
