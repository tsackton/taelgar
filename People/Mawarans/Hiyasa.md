%% Tim needs to incorporate notes from OneNote, has some backstory that connects to Chardon that I like %%

Daughter of [[Orden]], recently returned from 10 years away with a treasure map, possibly stolen from Chardon or Chardonians in some way. Promptly headed for one location, got stuck, and then rescued by the PCs.
