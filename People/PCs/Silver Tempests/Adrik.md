Adrik was born in [[Nardith]], the Dwarven kingdom in the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], to a small branch of the [[Boulderbeards]], living near the surface and tending goats and sheep on the high peaks. He was the oldest of three children, and the wildest, spending his childhood outside and away from the cities below. Adrik loved the high mountain peaks and open skies of his home, the small dwarven village of [[Narazara]]. 
 
As a boy in the mountains, Adrik caught the attention of [[Morgana Stoneclaw]], an annis hag. She appeared to him as a elderly Dwarven woman, slowly getting him to do worse and worse things, until one day he ran off from home in a rage, and in his anger saw through the hag's illusion and had a vision of her true form. He ran off shouting "It's a monster!" Morgana Stoneclaw was driven off by the villagers, and Adrik recovered, but the experience left him forever suspicious of authority. 

Adrik's live was fairly typical for many productive years after that, as he learned his thuhr ([[Stoneworker Thuhr|Stoneworker]]) and joined his family in their farming and animal husbandry. Until it all changed, dramatically. A severe pestilence struck the small community, destroying crops and food stores, and spreading a devastating sickness among the animals. The village, small to begin with and heavily dependent on their surface farms and herds, nearly starved, and was forced to retreat deeper under the mountains, seeking refuge and charity in [[Tharn Todor]] and other cities of [[Nardith]]. 

Adrik, convinced this was the act of [[Morgana Stoneclaw]], seeking revenge for his family, vowed in a flash of anger to seek vengeance and restore the family fortune. Carrying the family heirloom (an ancient treasure map), and channeling the power of the thunderstorms and his fury at the fate of his family, Adrik set of north towards [[Chardon]] and glory, where he quickly joined the [[Great Library]] to earn money and gain power in order to fuel his revenge.
