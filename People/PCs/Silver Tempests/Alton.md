Alton grew up poor on the streets of [[Chardon]], disconnected from the halfling community. He did not know who his parents were, or how he was separated from them, and can't remember much of his early life, except that he was always alone. Trying to escape his poor childhood, he eventually joined a group of traveling merchants, leaving the city and wandering the roads of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. It was an educational experience, and Alton learned to scout and keep himself hidden, but it was not a very lucrative experience. 

When Alton heard that the [[Great Library]] was recruiting adventurers to search for treasure and lost knowledge, he returned to [[Chardon]] and joined up. He was sent north, where he briefly joined [[Samso]], [[Adrik]], and [[Brelith]] to recover a scroll from some [[Kobolds]]. However, he did not stay with them, and instead wandered a bit, doing a variety of odd jobs for the [[Great Library]], especially focusing on tasks that required stealth and subtlety.

Nearly a year later, in March of DR 1748, Alton joined a group of adventurers, including [[Cassia]], a human paladin, and [[Brottor]], a dwarf, to investigate the depths of the ruined mines under [[Goldpeak Mountain]]. During the mission, [[Brottor]] was killed by minions of [[Vilaxes]], and Alton and Cassia only survived because of the [[Silver Tempests]], who found them and joined forces to defeat [[Vilaxes]]. 

Since then, Alton has been living in [[Voltara]] and occasionally traveling with the [[Silver Tempests]].
