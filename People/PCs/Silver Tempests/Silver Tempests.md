The Silver Tempests are a renowned adventuring party based out of [[Voltara]], on the northern frontier of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. Originally hired by [[Lyra]] to seek the [[Elemental Scrolls of Airion]], the Silver Tempests became famous after their role in [[Grumella's War]], and have since established an elaborate manor, the [[Tempest Towers]] in the center of [[Voltara]], near the baths and market. 

The core members of the Silver Tempests are:
- Adrik Boulderbeard, a lightning-touched barbarian from the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], far to the south
- Samso, a lizardfolk druid from the [[Yeraad River Basin]]
- Brelith, a dwarven cleric from [[Zarkandur]], who retired to open a restaurant in Voltara
- Aelar, an elven shadow monk, who grew up an orphan wandering around Chardon, and has since grown so stealthy that he disappeared into the background

Recently, the Silver Tempests have been joined by:
- Alton, a halfling rogue and proprietor of a dive bar outside Voltara known for offering recreational axe throwing to its patrons. Alton was originally hired by Lyra and traveled briefly with the Silver Tempests in their early days, but left her service and traveled alone for some time before rejoining the group in the Goldpeak Mines.
- Mabist, a changeling warlock from the [[Feywild]], with a mysterious past

The Silver Tempests traveled with two other adventurers in the past:
- Scordith, a human sorcerer, who briefly joined the Silver Tempests on a few early quests; and
- Aglath, a stoneborn warrior, who was born far away in the deserts of the east, and left to find his kin in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]
