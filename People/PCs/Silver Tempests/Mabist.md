Mabist is a changeling from the [[Feywild]]. He grew up in a time of war, a war between the fey and fathomless. He constantly yearned for it to cease and wished he could make a difference, so finally, when he came of age he volunteered to be a knight. Years of battle, bloodshed, and loss went by as Mabist rose through the ranks and gaining respect and trust from all. Eventually Mabist was even promoted to be a general of a full platoon. One day Mabist was tasked to take his men into the forefront of enemy lines, and so Mabist was gifted means of protection against the enemy's psychic powers, directly from the queen.

Mabist tore through the enemy lines, leading his men. But as he reached their leader, his men quickly dwindled due to the unforeseen defenses and sheer power of the enemy. Somehow, although only a dozen of them were left, Mabist and his knights were able to reach their leader. The battle was quickly ended due to the leaders unforeseen abilities, so seeing his comrades on the verge of death, he conceded himself to the enemy, allowing them to fully control him.

Mabist is a changeling from the an unknown area. He trained in the abyss during a time of war, a war between the fathomless and fey. He constantly yearned for victory and wished he could be the one to end the queen, so finally, when he gained enough power, he became a warior. Years of battle, bloodshed, and deaths went by as Mabist rose through the ranks and gaining fear and respect from all. Eventually Mabist was even promoted to be a general of a full platoon. One day Mabist was tasked to take his men into the forefront of enemy lines. So Mabist was gifted means of protection against the enemy's mystical powers, directly from the leader.

Mabist tore through the enemy lines, leading his creatures. But as he reached their queen, his men quickly dwindled due to the unforeseen defenses and sheer power of the enemy. Somehow, although only a dozen of them were left, Mabist and his monsters were able to reach the queen.  Mabist was quickly subdued by their queen though he was, for some reason spared.

Mabist's vision went dark and his thirst for blood calmed. He only could remembered crying then a faint glow. Then, everything went blank, his memories and his life anything from his mental banks were gone. Only his common knowledge and proficiencies remained.

The queen was saddened to see one of her greatest warriors was reduced to a savage blood craving beast, he had even changed his appearance. The queen only recognized her knight when he had  been knocked out. It seemed Mabist's bloodthirst was calmed and he became at a strange form of discomforting peace. For the queen, she only saw a husk of her former warrior, for she whipped Mabist's memory. In an attempt to return Mabist to his former self, she instead created a blank sheet of paper. For Mabist, this is where everything went dark.

The queen decided it was best for Mabist to not rejoin the feywilds and instead find his own story. So he was dropped off unconscious in an unknown area near a commoner hut. From then on Mabist was rehabilitated by Dinia.
