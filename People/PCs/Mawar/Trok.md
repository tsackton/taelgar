Trok grew up in a nearby lizard folk salt marsh village, a promising young star. The family for generations has specialized in ritual wrestling matches that accompany the coming of age ceremony, at which a young lizard folk warrior receives their first tattoo. Great prestige comes with winning the tournament, and Trok was rising through the ranks, as the family traveled from village to village. He was very close to his great grandmother, Sokara, a legendary tattoo artist. She taught him to master the delicate art of making the tattoo inks and breathing magic into finely stippled designs on the scales. This work is done best under the influence of a carefully controlled dose of the ritual preparation of gatza tea. When she passed on Trok was despondent, quit fighting, and befriended a local human hunter, who helped him find better sources of gatza closer to the sea. For a time he lived alone on the beach, addicted to gatza, trying to reach Sokara, his health wasting away. Gradually he developed relationships with some of the humans of the town, and came to serve a role as a sea watcher, using his extraordinary powers to make rescues, salvage wrecks, and defend the harbor.
