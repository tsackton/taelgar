# Players of Taelgar

Many groups have adventured in Taelgar over the years. 

Major campaigns have included:

- The [[Heroes of the Great War]], a campaign run by Tim and featuring [[Rai]], [[Kyr]], [[Aerin]], and [[Beryl]], were active in DR 1544-1545 in Taelgar, and 1993-1997 in the real world
- The [[Silver Tempests]], a campaign run by Tim and featuring Adrick, Samso, Brelith, Mabist, Alton, and others, were active from DR 1747- in Taelgar, and from 2019-2023 in the real world, with sporadic adventures from 2023-.
- The [[Dunmar Fellowship]], sometimes known as the Side Quests, a campaign run by Tim and featuring [[Wellby]], [[Seeker]], [[Delwath]], and [[Kenzo]], with frequent appearances by [[Riswynn]], and many other guests, were active from DR 1748- in Taelgar, and from 2020- in the real world.
- The [[Heroes of Cleenseau]], a campaign run by Mike and featuring [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil]], [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]], [[Celyn]], and [[Viepuck]], were active in DR 1719- in Taelgar and from 2023- in the real world
- The Addermarch Mercenaries, a campaign run by Tim and featuring [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]], and [[Drou]]. Active from 2024- in the real world, and not yet canonically placed in Taelgar, but happening sometime between DR 1720 - DR 1740.

In addition, several shorter adventures and series of one-shots have included:

- The [[Mawar Adventures]], following the exploits of the heroes and adventurers of [[Hamri]], in the [[Mawar Confederacy]]
- The [[Labyrinths of the Lost]], a short adventure in [[Western Cymea]]
- The Murder in [[Ausson's Crossing]], a short adventure in the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]], featuring [[Izar]], [[Roe DoTorka]], and [[Soraine]], set in DR 1688, which ran in Sept 2022 - Jan 2023 in the real world %% Note this included a fourth PC but the character concept was reused for the Cleenseau campaign; so although the locations and people of Ausson's Crossing are canonical, it is not clear if the adventure actually is or not, and it certainly isn't exactly the way it happened  %%
- The Stone Titan, a short adventure set in [[Dunmore]] and the [[Western Marches]] during the wars in the years following the [[Great War]]. %%note - which of the Sembaran wars this is set during was never canonically established, all it needs is (a) a war on the western frontier during which Dunmore is occupied by Sembarans, and (b) weird magic and mind flayers are involved. Sentinel Ranger War, or the First Hobgoblin War, are the most likely culprits%%
- Tollen Adventures, a pair of one-shots set in the city of [[Tollen]]. %%note - likely somtime in the 1740s but never canonically placed in time. %%
- A variety of adventures featuring [[Riswynn]] and [[Oskar]] set in and around the [[Yuvanti Mountains]]. %%note - these were Riswynn adventures during the time the rest of the party was traveling around the desert, the first journey to Kharsan, and dealing with Agata%% 

%% to add:
- Ausson's Crossing Mini Series
- Plaguelands Campaign (potentially non-canonical, as it faded before the climax)
