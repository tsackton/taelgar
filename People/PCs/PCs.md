# Players of Taelgar

Many groups have adventured in Taelgar over the years. 

Among the most famous are the [[Heroes of the Great War]]. While many of the details of their adventures are lost to time, now told as legends and myths, the names of [[Rai]], [[Kyr]], [[Aerin]], and [[Beryl]], the heroes who defeated the shadow dragon [[Cha'mutte]] and ended the [[Great War]], are widely known. 

In the DR 1700s, four groups of adventurers are most active in Taelgar:
- The [[Dunmar Fellowship]], a renowned group of adventurers who met in [[Karawa]] in DR 1748, and have since [[Dunmari Frontier Campaign|traveled across much of the world of Taelgar]] in their flying skyship [[Vindristjarna]]. 
- The [[Silver Tempests]], whose exploits are [[Great Library Campaign|chronicled elsewhere]], a group of heroes made a name for themselves in the [[Northern Provinces]] of the [[Drankorian Empire]] in the late DR 1740s. 
- The [[Heroes of Cleenseau]], a party of heroes who met in [[Cleenseau]] in DR 1719, and have since made a name for themselves as they [[Cleenseau Campaign|work to defend]] the people of southern [[Sembara]]. 
- The [[Addermarch Mercenaries]], a group of chance-met travelers, whose exploits in the service of [[Caradoc]] the alchemist are [[Addermarch Campaign|chronicled elsewhere]].

Other adventurers include:
- The [[Adventurers of Mawar]], united by their shared home of [[Hamri]], and whose exploits are [[Mawar Adventures|told elsewhere]].
- The [[Oskar's Companions|companions of Oskar and Riswynn]], who [[Oskar in Tharn Todor|solved some problems]] around [[Tharn Todor]] in DR 1748
- The [[Labyrinth Prisoners|prisoners of Grimstone]], who [[Labyrinths of the Lost|escaped]] from an abandoned manor in [[Western Cymea]].
- [[Izar]], [[Roe DoTorka]], and [[Soraine]], who investigated a murder in [[Ausson's Crossing]] in DR 1688.

- The [[Dunmar Fellowship]], sometimes known as the Side Quests, a campaign run by Tim and featuring [[Wellby]], [[Seeker]], [[Delwath]], and [[Kenzo]], with frequent appearances by [[Riswynn]], and many other guests, were active from DR 1748- in Taelgar, and from 2020- in the real world.
- The [[Heroes of Cleenseau]], a campaign run by Mike and featuring [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil]], [[Robin of Abenfyrd|Robin]], [[Celyn]], and [[Viepuck]], were active in DR 1719- in Taelgar and from 2023- in the real world

In addition, several shorter adventures and series of one-shots have included:

- The [[Mawar Adventures]], following the exploits of the heroes and adventurers of [[Hamri]], in the [[Mawar Confederacy]]
- The [[LL - Player Background]], a short adventure in [[Western Cymea]]
- The Murder in [[Ausson's Crossing]], a short adventure in the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]], featuring [[Izar]], [[Roe DoTorka]], and [[Soraine]], set in DR 1688, which ran in Sept 2022 - Jan 2023 in the real world %% Note this included a fourth PC but the character concept was reused for the Cleenseau campaign; so although the locations and people of Ausson's Crossing are canonical, it is not clear if the adventure actually is or not, and it certainly isn't exactly the way it happened  %%
- The Stone Titan, a short adventure set in [[Dunmore]] and the [[Western Marches]] during the wars in the years following the [[Great War]]. %%note - which of the Sembaran wars this is set during was never canonically established, all it needs is (a) a war on the western frontier during which Dunmore is occupied by Sembarans, and (b) weird magic and mind flayers are involved. Sentinel Ranger War, or the First Hobgoblin War, are the most likely culprits%%
- Tollen Adventures, a pair of one-shots set in the city of [[Tollen]]. %%note - likely sometime in the 1740s but never canonically placed in time. %%
- A variety of adventures featuring [[Riswynn]] and [[Oskar]] set in and around the [[Yuvanti Mountains]]. %%note - these were Riswynn adventures during the time the rest of the party was traveling around the desert, the first journey to Kharsan, and dealing with Agata%%
