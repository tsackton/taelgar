Celyn is a slightly short, pale, blond young human man, probably in his early twenties, with quick hands and a wide, open blue-eyed attention.  His demeanor is generally cheerful if perhaps a bit naive; he appears to be amiably accepting of a number of the foibles of other people around him where someone else might make comment.  Perhaps this is related to the way he is utterly unapologetic about his own quirks, which are reasonably numerous and include frequent references to luck and good fortune, current objects of his apparently infinite curiosity, and off-the-wall commentary.  He does not make eye contact but is very clearly attentive to conversations he’s in; he has small brief rituals that he does when drinking wine.  
  
He wears studded leather armor, and where his leathers are not brown they are largely done in colors of blue and yellow, perhaps because they go with his hair and eyes.  While he is kitted out like a rogue in general, he also carries a small wooden shield (not routinely, but when he’s anticipating trouble), which has been painted (not skillfully) with two blobs of color which vaguely resemble birds and has some interesting nature-y bits tied to it.  He also has a drum which has been painted with dots and swirls and zigzags and which has a lot of sticks, feathers, and such dangling from its lacings; he is not particularly proficient with its use but he can at least keep time.  
  
He has a distinct rural Tyrwingan accent and, unsurprisingly for someone from [[Tyrwingha|that nation]], makes commentary about the fey.  He has explicitly claimed that the fey taught him how to misty step, in fact, and that they sent him to this area by dropping acorns on his head.  To anyone with a familiarity with Tyrwingan culture, “fey-touched lunatic” is a solid guess here.

> Celyn comes from a vineyard working family and was apprenticed to a boundary-walker/fey tender/fairy faith shrine keeper because he was obviously more suited to that than the vineyard; he had a difficult adolescence and “found peace” with [[The Wyrdling]].

>[!Info]- Additional Context (Chris' Eyes Only)
>Celyn is an avid dice gamer.  He is not an avid _gambler_, he just _really loves dice_.  We’re at “the shiny math rocks go clicky-clack” levels of joy at dice.  He is very judicious about the gambling part, clearly only staking what he can afford; it’s all about the throwing the dice and seeing what happens, not the money or even the possibility of winning money, and he accepts all results with that same wide-eyed enthusiasm that he does everything else.  
  > 
He did some work with a traveling theatre troupe at some point but parted ways with them because “they went the wrong way”.  He does not appear to have been a performer, but rather some kind of backstage worker.

> [!INFO]- Celyn's Background (For Kiya\'s Eyes Only)
> The child who would become Celyn is from a small village in Tyrwingha.  He was a middle-younger child in a large family who mostly worked in the local vineyard.  He started out as rather a troublesome mooncalf child and rapidly wound up in something of an apprenticeship to the local who was responsible for maintaining the fairy-faith customs, as that is the sort of job that gets given to the people who struck the locals as being fey-touched in some way.  
>
His deeply mischievous nature continued to cause trouble, especially when he got more difficult rather than sweet-natured about it after puberty hit and dysphoria made him cranky.  He threw himself more thoroughly into his devotions, spending time at sacred sites to try dream incubation (which at least kept him out of other people’s hair), learning how to alter his appearance to look more fey or more masculine or both, and generally wishing for some power - fey or divine - to Make It Better.  
  >
After one of those pilgrimages, he came back changed, including in insisting on a new name (‘Celyn’ means ‘holly’, for the record*), and most people thought for the better; something, at least, had shifted in him to make him less furious at the shape of the world and thus much less likely to be difficult.  It was not clear for some time what the change *was*, though, given his return to minding the fey rites and minor mischief, until he healed someone after a farming accident.  He has resisted having his clerical magic bent into some sort of orderly role or hierarchy, both on his own account and because he will not impose order on his relationship with his god.  
>  
He has a deep devotion that is, in manner, almost childlike: there is an innocence about it that is easy to mistake for naivete.  That simplicity, however, and purity of hopefulness and a willingness to trust to chance, led to his cultivation of actual divine attention.  He is still a bit of a bundle of amiable chaos - as one might expect of a Wyrdling devotee - but his teenaged anger is more or less resolved by his embrace of that chaos and ambiguity.  
>  
He is not entirely blown by the wind; he trusts his intuition profoundly, along with the guidance of the fey and his god.  (Which puts him in a good position to be at the whims of higher powers.)  It’s likely he wandered out of his home turf a bit ago, following some impulse or other, and those impulses and occasional directives from the Wyrdling or friendly fey eventually steered him to where he is.

Celyn’s Personal Miracle Story  
  
  
Celyn pours himself another cup of wine, and dips his fingers into it, flicking three drops onto the earth. "I have another one to tell," he says, staring up into the branches of the tree. "I, it's not one I've told before so I probably won't do a very good job of it." He flicks a few more droplets onto the ground, and takes a drink, as if fortifying himself.  
  
"I told you I was difficult when I was younger. There were times that I was really, really difficult. Not just fae-touched mischief. I was never that good at keeping up with my chores in the vineyard at the best of times, but there was a bit where I was just angry, all the time, about everything. Sometimes I broke things. Sometimes I stole things, and didn't leave something shiny where they'd been. I'd probably have gotten into a lot more trouble except the fey liked me and that meant that people were nervous about punishing me too much, you know?”  
  
He clearly cannot tell this story when looking at Robin, the way he's continuing to stare up into the tree, not even in the paladin's direction. "I apprenticed to the boundary-keeper and learned how to take care of the shrines for the fey. Which … I was a lot better at than the chores. That's when they taught me a little magic, when I was out there. And it wasn't that I wasn't angry all the time, but … the things that I could do about it were more useful. I wasn't breaking pots, I was cleaning muck off stones that shouldn't have muck on them, and practicing fighting my shadow, and sometimes some fey or other would make my shadow move so it was more fun. But I was angry, and it wasn't getting better.”  
  
He does take a glance over at Robin before continuing. "I'm not sure if they worried about me, or what. The fey, I mean. But one day they sent me deeper into the woodland, and I'm not sure if the place they sent me was quite here or there or what. But it was a holy place. I knew that when I got there. I don't know if they thought it was holy, or if they just knew that I could be healed there.”  
  
He looks up at the branches again. "It was a tree. But it wasn't a tree like a tree. It was... it was getting along towards time for harvest, but the tree was still in spring bloom. Had been in spring bloom for months, from all the flowers that had fallen off and were scattered around the roots. It was... all out of season. Just like me." He lets out a long breath. "It was a holy place for the Wyrdling. I knew it like I knew anything, and I just, I laid down under the tree and went to sleep.”  
  
He scrubs the side of his face with one hand. "I dreamed of birds. Two birds. They're painted on my old shield but I'm not very good at painting so they're not very good birds, but that's what they're supposed to be. In the dream, when they sang in my ears, I understood them. One of them told me why I was angry. The other one told me that I was loved." He gestures softly. "The two faces of the Wyrdling, they came to me in a dream, as birds, and when I woke up, the … the angry I had been for years, it was gone. And so was my old name. The Wyrdling took it away.”  
  
Celyn chuckles to himself. "So when I woke up, I needed a name. Celyn. I took Celyn as a name. It means holly, you know. And I wasn't angry anymore. That was my miracle, the finding my place. And that's how I became a priest."

This is all good. The only change I might make is around the line "the shrines of the fey" and the word "boundary-keeper" (temple steward would be the right in-game word).  Even in Tyrwingha where the fey are relatively common and a lot of the political hierarchy is formally structured as obedient to Ethleen*, the fey aren't _worshipped_, per se. I would imagine it more like....

    
I would expect that the major home temple was a Wildling temple, honestly, given agricultural village, hence why the fey had to take Celyn *somewhere else* to put him in touch with the Wyrdling?

In Celyn's village, the temple steward** would have had the additional responsibility of keeping on eye on the relations with the fey, and formally at least, helping those who took Ethleen's bargain**** make it to the Feywild (although no one from Clawyn has taken the bargain even in the memory of Rhys, who attended Queen Cece's coronation celebrations in Tafolwern as a teenage almost 70 years ago). This would involve lots of different things -- tending to a certain oak grove, setting aside the first bloom from a certain tree, leaving exactly thirteen grapes by the village well before pressing, cleaning stones, and yes, fighting your shadow and drumming and singing songs at first moonlight every third full moon on a certain grassy knoll, But shrines feels like the wrong word for these kinds of places, as folks don't really pray to the fey. There is probably a mixture of appeasement, caretaking, and duty in the normal Tyrwinghan's relationship with the fey....

  

appeasement, because of course the fey are powerful and tricky and you don't want them on your bad side

caretaking, because these are also Ethleen's subjects, even if they are somewhat mysterious ones, and part of the culture of Tyrwingha is a loving connection to Ethleen. So some Tyrwinghans might feel quite possessive of their local fey and quite inclined to see themselves as the supporters/providers for the fey

duty, because again, Ethleen, and even if you don't love the fey personally, or find there mystery/mischivery a bit distasteful, it is still a Tyrwinghan's duty to look out for all of Ethleen's subjects

  

So anyway that is a long diversion to basically say it all sounds fine :-D

  

------------------------

  

* The monarch of Tyrwingha is elected by the Oracles of the Riven, a group of six powerful and somewhat mysterious figures, usually warlocks. It is said that when an Oracle dies, Ethleen appoints their successor, although whether this is true or not, Celyn doesn't know. It would certainly be plausible to believe it, or not, or be somewhat unsure -- Tyrwinghans are all three. But it is undisputed historical fact that Ethleen has appointed _some_ of the historical Oracles, especially in the period around the Great War about 150 years ago. There is also a longstanding understanding in Tyrwingha that anyone may 

  

** Remember, the basic temple hierarchy of Mos Numena (the religion of the Eight Divines***) has two parts: the administrators and managers of the temple, called temple stewards, are not necessarily particularly well connected to the gods, and are usually employed by the town, city, village, etc to provide upkeep, social organizing, event planning, etc. Then there are the priests, who have very little hierarchy and are pretty disorganized, but who are the ones with real connections to the gods. Some small villages could easily have both a temple steward and a priest, but it's somewhat random -- priests are not members of some kind of large hierarchy and are assigned out, it is all more personal than that.

  

*** In both Tyrwingha and Sembara, each divine is worshipped separately, and temples are always to a specific divine. In Sembara though, they have this odd tradition of asking "their" god to talk to the other gods, whereas in Tyrwingha although each shrine or temple is dedicated to a single god, many people worship many different gods. So in Clawyn there is probably just one temple (to the Wyrdling, I guess). But in a larger town in Tyrwingha there would be multiple temples, and even in Clawyn Celyn's neighbor the midwife had a small altar to the Mother in her garden, and the village cemetery a small shrine to the Night Queen. One of the weirder things about Cleenseau is that they all seem to worship the Warlord and they ask him to talk to all the other gods. So even during Vitalae, which is dedicated to the Wanderer, you'd here all of these Sembarans say things like, "Warlord, please tell the Wanderer I am in need of charity this night.." or whatever.

  

**** There is a longstanding story in Tyrwingha that there is a place in Ethleen's court for any Tyrwinghan who desires to renounce the human realm and come live in the Feywild. This is said to have been part of her condition for allowing Drankor (the ancient empire, long gone, vague Roman analog) to rule the land.
