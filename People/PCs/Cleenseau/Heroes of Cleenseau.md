A group of four fate-blown adventures who met in [[Taviose]] during the [[First Spider Attack on Tavoise]]. Since then, have become well-known in the region. 

The heroes consist of:

* [[Robin of Abenfyrd]], a paladin of [[The Wanderer]] from the small town of [[Abenfyrd]] in [[Tyrwingha]]
* [[Celyn]], a rogue and devotee of [[The Wyrdling]], from the small vineyard town of [[Clawyn]], also in [[Tyrwingha]]
* [[Izgil Moonseeker]], a dwarf from [[Nidzahar]], a lunar socerer
* [[Viepuck]], an teenaged orphan from [[Embry]], a devotee of a mysterious mind from far away
