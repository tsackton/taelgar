The Greenrabbits have long traveled the roads of Sembara, meandering and trading what strikes their fancy: dyed cloth from Tollen, silverwork from Tyrwingha by way of Eskbridge, ceramics from Rinburg. Yvan was born into this comfortable, if not particularly elaborate, life. He spent his youth traveling: a caravan of three large wagons, many ponies, and dozens of family. 

Even from a young age, Yvan was blessed with supernatural luck. Things always seemed to go right for him: getting lost on a farmland path meant finding a patch of ripe blackberries, and tripping and falling meant finding a dropped coin. In towns, whatever he said to people seemed to be exactly what they wanted to hear, and Yvan quickly found himself on a path to a comfortable life as a trader with his family.

This all changed one afternoon on the road between Fellburn and Wisford. It was a rainy day, and a wagon got stuck in the mud. Trying to help shift the wheel, Yvan felt magic surge through him and suddenly fire erupted underneath the wagon. The horses spooked and ran, and the wagon caught fire. Fortunately, in the rain, the fire didn't spread and was quickly doused, but the damage to the wagon was considerable. No one blamed Yvan, not exactly, but there was a newfound caution around him at camp that night. The next day, fearing that if something like this happened again, people would die, he left his family.

Since then, Yvan has wandered, mostly heading gradually south, eventually ending up in Addermarch. Without his family, it has been a struggle to survive, doing what odd jobs he could here and there. Until recently, when he heard rumors of Caradoc, an alchemist in the hills that was offering steady contract work for mercenaries. Eager for steady pay, Yvan headed up the Aben towards Roscombe.
