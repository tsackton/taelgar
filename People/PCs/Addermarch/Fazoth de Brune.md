![[assets/fazoth-full.png|right|400]]Fazoth de Brune, a younger scion of the wealthy de Brune family, grew up with a life of privilege on the outskirts of [[Eskbridge]], thanks to his family's wealth and position. At the age of 22, he left [[Sembara]] for [[Addermarch]]. 

%% BACKSTORY

Fazoth de Brune, a younger son of the wealthy de Brune family, was born on his family's manor on the outskirts of Eskbridge, a fortified town along the Enst river. Fazoth grew up in relative luxury, supported by his family's extensive mercantile connections along the river valley, and trading network reaching into Addermarch even. 

Unknown to outsiders, the de Brune family also had a secret: they were powerful supporters and members of a secret cult connected to the archfey [[Lord Serenveil]]. When he turned 18, Fazoth was inducted into the cult, and soon found himself advancing quickly, due to his natural charisma and his family connection.

Recently, he was summoned by [[Lord Serenveil]] himself, who appeared before Fazoth as a tall, towering figure, with long flowing silver hair and dark skin, dressed in robes that shifted colors between deep purples, dusky blues, and silvery grays. Staring at Fazoth with fiery eyes like a fading sunset, he offered a deal: power, the magic of the Feywild, in exchange for service. 

Fazoth accepted, and learned his first mission: travel to Addermarch, and make your way to the village of Roscombe, where there is an alchemist named Caradoc. Join his service, and learn what you can about him.

(currently 22 years old)

[[Lord Serenveil]], Prince of the Vesperwind, Guardian of Twilight's Edge:

Tall, towering figure, long flowing silver hair, dark skin, dressed in robes that shift colors between deep purples, dusky blues, and silvery grays. Fiery eyes, like fading sunset.
