From Orenlas, ka 37
Wandering around Tyrwingha and Addermarch
Want to be useful to the world. People need joy in their lives and songs and music bring cheer.
Somewhere in Addermarch here about the alchemist / possible fey
Decide to go - partly out of curiosity, partly out of a sense of doing good, helping the world

Drou was born in DR 1637, of the 37th ka, in the elven forest of Orenlas. She woke from the dreaming with her generation-mates in DR 1712, and quickly showed a talent for music and dance, even to the extent of channeling the magic of the elves through her art. After spending a few years learning the songs of Orenlas, Drou left, wanting to be useful to the world, and bring joy to people's lives.

Drou traveled through Tyrwingha, Addermarch, and southern Sembara for a few years, learning songs and sharing music. She was peripherally involved in the Undead Attacks on Sembara, when zombies rose all along the Enst and attacked many settlements. Drou helped tend the wounded and was on the outskirts of several battles along the Enst, and in the foothills of the Mostreve Hills, near the borders of Addermarch.

After that, she wandered for some time, mastering her art, and perhaps occasionally returning to Orenlas. 

Until recently, when she heard of the alchemist Caradoc recruiting mercenaries to his cause. Curious, and motivated by sense of wanting to help the world, Drou left for Roscombe.
