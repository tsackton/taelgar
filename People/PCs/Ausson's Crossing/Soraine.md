Notes:
Soraine and Viepuck similar things
lots in email for pc background

Your family has been retainers of the Duke of Marseau for several generations (perhaps dated back to the Great War ~150 years ago -- during which time Maseau became its own duchy populated mostly with refugees from Insingue). You are not the favored son (a father/mother/brother/sister is the one in the duke's favor).  In your recent background (last couple of years) you had some adventure (will provide more details if the basic background works) which ended with you gaining mysterious magical powers - anchored by an odd gray marking on your skin. 

 After gaining these powers, you had some adventures (can work out details if you like, or leave it vague). In the last month, however, your gray marking has been telling you (somehow, again, if the basic idea works I will give more details) that something terrible is happening, and like a compass, has led you to it.
  
The morning the game will start you would ride into the Last Inn, knowing that somewhere nearby is the source of foreboding.
