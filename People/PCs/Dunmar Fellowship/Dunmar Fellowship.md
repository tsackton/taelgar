# The Dunmar Fellowship

An adventuring party who met in Dunmar and have traveled together from April 1748 through the present.

- The elven warlock [[Delwath]]
- The halfling scout [[Wellby]] and his axebeak mount and companion [[Baxter]]

They frequently travel with the dwarven cleric [[Riswynn]]. The stoneborn druid [[Drikod]] traveled with them from May 23 1748 through June 20 1748. 

In the fall of 1748, they were split up due to magical effects. During this time, they traveled alone.

- Kenzo traveled with [[Izzarak]] in the lizardfolk jungles to the south
- Delwath traveled with [[Iascaire]] and [[Aristaea]] in the battlefields of the far north

- Riswynn traveled with [[Thror]], [[Rothfis]], and [[Merash]] in the [[shadowfell]] domain of [[Morkalan]].

Kenzo, Seeker, and Wellby were reunited in the Feywild and traveled with [[Caulaus]] briefly.

The group was reunited on Nov 15 1748 in Dunmar.
