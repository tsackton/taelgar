FInnan Oakstride is a halfling storyteller, a wanderer, and a collector of tales. 

(backstory - to flesh out a bit)

Born in lowlands somewhere - maybe Tollen, maybe Vostok. probably not Sembara. 

Family traveled a lot, like many halflings, but they were not merchants or traders; instead, they told tales, did tricks, sang songs. Usually they could get room and board, at least, even in the small villages along the teft or volta, or the little towns on the southern vostok coast. 

Finnan learned a touch of illusion magic young (minor illusion cantrip)

from his parents he learned how to play (the fiddler was his normal show instrument, but a small clay flute was his personal favorite), and how to perform, how to put on a show

but what he actually loved to do was listen to the people of each village. he started writing down songs at first, collecting the melodies of the little villages he passed through, many of which had never been written down before.

(vibe here is Olive Dame Campbell a little bit)

he always wanted to go to smaller and smaller places, more and more isolated villages. the further north, the deeper in the words, the better, for it was there that he found old tales of the kestavo, old songs of the ancient people. even, he thought, lingering mentions of the great lizardfolk swamp from ancient days that the stories of his people say once was here. 

of course the rest of his family - his parents, his two siblings (one older sister, one younger brother), and several cousins, aunts, and uncles (i imagine the troop was about 12-15 in all) - never wanted to go into the woods. the tiny villages couldn't feed them all, and even if they could, it was a burden on them. 

the family would always drift back towards the coast, or at least the lower reaches of the volta, especially in the winters, often ending up in tollen or some such place. these had no interest to finnan. the tales were interested, but there were few new stories to hear in tolllen. 

(the family probably traveled frequently by riverboat, heading up the volta in the spring and coming back to more shelered lands in the winter; sometimes venturing to the teft or one of the vostok rivers)

by the time he reached his late 20s/early 30s he amicably parted ways with his family and heading inland towards the mountains. 

over next ~20 years presumably had some adventures, and met justas

i think maybe it took him 10ish years to kind of settle in, wandering a lot, but for the past 10 years or so he has traveled mostly with justas, occasionally drifting off when curiosity took him. 

during this time, he has been composing the tales of the kestavo and the songs of the zimka, mostly committing them to memory and setting them in the halfling style, but i would assume he has a reputation around the area for his tales. 

the vibe is not really a musician, although he does play, but rather spoken word / chanted storytelling set to fiddle music.
