![[finnan-oakstride.png|right|360]]Finnan Oakstride is a halfling storyteller, a wanderer, and a collector of tales. 

Finnan was born on the road outside [[Telham]], and spend his childhood on the road, like many halflings. His parents were not merchants, or traders. Instead, they told tales, sang songs, and did some juggling and acrobatics, traveling with a group about about 10 other halflings in three small wagons, sometimes trading them for a riverboat. They moved around, usually drifting among the small towns along the [[Teft]] and [[Volta]], sometimes as far east as coastal [[Vostok]], occasionally as far northwest as [[Breva]]. In most small towns, they could at least get a good night's dinner for their time, and sometimes a place to sleep, if there was space -- but when there wasn't, the wagons sufficed. 

It was a happy childhood, and Finnan loved the wonder of it. He learned to sing, and play (the fiddle was his usual performance; a small clay flute was his personal favorite), and even how to weave a touch of illusion magic into his stories. But what he actually loved to do more than anything was listen to the people in each small village. He started writing down songs, collecting the melodies of the folk tunes people sang at work, or in prayer, or for entertain in the long winters. 

As he grew into his young adulthood, he kept pushing to go to smaller and smaller places, the more isolated, the better. For it was in the isolated tiny villages in the hills where he found people who still sung old songs in an ancient language and told tales of the kestavo. Of course, these places rarely could manage to feed the full group, and even if they did, Finnan knew they couldn't really afford to. The family humored him, but always drifted back towards the coast, towards Tollen and Telham, and the smaller market towns dotting the lower reaches of the great rivers. 

When Finnan was 28, he amicably parted ways with his family and headed into the highland woods, on the slopes of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]].

over next ~20 years presumably had some adventures, and met justas

i think maybe it took him 10ish years to kind of settle in, wandering a lot, but for the past 10 years or so he has traveled mostly with justas, occasionally drifting off when curiosity took him. 

during this time, he has been composing the tales of the kestavo and the songs of the zimka, mostly committing them to memory and setting them in the halfling style, but i would assume he has a reputation around the area for his tales. 

the vibe is not really a musician, although he does play, but rather spoken word / chanted storytelling set to fiddle music.
