Hero of the [[Great War]]. 

%%NOTES
A mage of immense power, one of the Peronar, the half-born, the descendants of the elves who lived on Hkar with humanity. The last of the High Peronar, the magical elite of Hkar and later Drankor.

Known for his familiar, Dimataur, a winged lizard-like creature, and a hand that was slowly turning to jade.

Current whereabouts unknown, but was active in the Plaguelands after the Great War, despite having largely turned to stone in the act of killing Cha'mutte.
