A powerful frost giant king who ruled the frost giant realm of [[Kaldhalla]] in its heyday. He established [[Kaldhalla]] as a refugee for the people of the north, and led his armies in many battles against dragons and other creatures of the north to keep the [[~Northern Boreal Forest~]] safe. 

He led the giants of [[Kaldhalla]] into [[Vimfrost's War|war]] against the ancient white dragon [[Vimfrost]], ultimately falling in battle.
