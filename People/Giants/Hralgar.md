## Hralgar

%%SECRET
#### Personalities

The sage of old: in this mood, try to make clear confusion with questions about [[Dunmar]], [[Cha'mutte]], anything post-fall of Drankor. Omens should warn of a great disaster coming, the downfall of the powerful and the rise of the meek, the scattering of knowledge to the winds, great waves of death spreading from the heart of the empire. Chardon is a minor outpost, [[Dunmar]] doesn't exist, etc. But in this mood, his knowledge of the Dreamworld and other planes is unparalleled and could go on about that. Desires above all stories and tales of omens - he collects these, searching for linked meaning in odd dreams, unusual visions, prophecies, and curses. He will be happy to trade knowledge for knowledge but will be increasingly confused about what he is hearing. Will refer to Eudomes and such.

The wild storm: In this mood, try to make clear both the helpful and chaotic and very quickly changing nature of Hralgar. This is similar to how he has been so far - sometimes helpful but in a demanding, unfriendly way; sometimes chaos driven. But also should be quick to anger and have somewhat unclear criteria for judging worthiness. In this state, he has some vague sense of the current day but this is also the most Dreamworld-dominate state and memories of the past bleed in sometimes, such as the sky.

The trapped giant: In this mood, Hralgar is completely aware of the situation in the present day. His main concern is getting free, and he is angry. He is willing to bargain but this should be in many ways the least friendly mood. He is ashamed that he was caught and so lashes out, and also this whole experience has made him disdainful of the little folk; all he wants is to retreat into the far reaches of the world and watch for signs of changing times, exploring the dreamworld.

#### Backstory and History

Hralgar Skaldjotendur is an elder storm giant from the days of Drankor, who was bound to this tower by Eudomes in the latter days of the Drankorian Empire, and then descended into madness during his long days of captivity after the fall of Drankor. Recently, he was partially awoken by Chardonian explorers, but cannot free himself until the eyes and crown created by Eudomes are destroyed.

Eudomes and his allies used the energy of the ley line and powerful magic in the iron sphere and the manacles to bind Hralgar. The effect was in some ways like a modified version of the Imprisonment spell, combined with Magic Jar. Hralgar does not need to eat or sleep or breath, and doesn't age, while under the effects. His soul / mind / awareness was captured in the crystals on the statue (2 eyes, 5 in crown), and the idea, born of extreme desperation, was to use him as a weapon of last resort against Apollyon.

When the Society of the Open scroll adventurers explored the tower, they found the statue and removed the gems, destroying the magic jar like effect and sending Hralgar's soul back to his body, but in a very damaged state. He awoke, and went mad.

Now, Hralgar is using the power of the "phase stone" inn ancient skyship to bolster his hold on reality and anchor this area to the material plane. When he loses control, dreams and reality mix. The stone itself is a special storm giant ore used to manipulate the boundaries between planes, especially the dreamworld, and to share and experience waking omens. Also used to power skyships by imagining a different physics.

#### The Statue

Hralgar was bound to a human-sized stone bust of a giant, with two crystal eyes and five crystals set in its crown.

The eyes control his perception of the world. The crown controls his mental state / emotions.

Restoring all crystals would allow him to free himself. Restoring the eyes gives him sight but not control. Restoring the crown gives him control but not sight, although if all five crown crystals are restored that might be enough?
