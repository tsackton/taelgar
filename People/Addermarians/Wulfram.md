# Wulfram
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> An Addermarian [[Humans|human]] (he/him)

%% cleanup AI-generated content %%
## Overview
Wulfram served as temple steward of [[The Warlord]] at [[Torvaine Watch]], tending the chapel and advising the garrison on matters of faith and honor. When the cursed [[Serpentine Dagger]] appeared, he urged it be locked away and carried word to the wider church—actions that put him in the path of the dagger’s corruption.

## Personality & Outlook
Steady, devout, and practical, Wulfram believed faith must be coupled with sensible precautions. He favored duty over glory, counseling restraint even as tensions mounted at the watch. His final acts were shaped by compassion, attempting to comfort families like that of [[Piri]] and to warn allies before disaster struck.

## Relationships
- **Marshal [[Hildo Brask]]** – Partner in maintaining morale; they coordinated letters and relief for the troops’ families.  
- **[[Bartoz]]** – Collaborated to secure the dagger and calm fears spreading through the barracks.  
- **Sir [[Einrik Arpaad]]** – Commander he tried to counsel, unaware the dagger had already ensnared him.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-04-27)** – Advises Brask and Bartoz to contain the dagger and prepares letters to families of the fallen.  
- **(DR:: 1715-04-28)** – Killed when the corrupted Sir Einrik turns on the garrison.  
- **(Aftermath)** – Remembered through surviving letters and testimonies recovered by the adventurers.

%% _DM_ note: Session 2 excerpts include Wulfram’s Drankorian journal entries—dreaming of stabbing Brother Aravis with the jeweled dagger—and his plan to send the relic to Valcroix once the rains eased (see [[Session 2 - DM Notes|Session 2 - DM Notes]]). %%
