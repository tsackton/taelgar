![[|right|360]]Temple steward of [[The Warlord]] at [[Torvaine Watch]], who urged the containment of the [[Serpentine Dagger]] and is remembered through accounts of the fort’s fall.

## Overview
Wulfram served as temple steward, tending the chapel and advising the garrison on matters of faith and honor. When the cursed dagger appeared, he urged it be locked away and carried word to the wider church—actions that put him in the path of the dagger’s corruption.

## Relationships
- [[Hildo Brask]] — Partner in maintaining morale; they coordinated letters and relief for the troops’ families.
- [[Bartoz]] — Collaborated to secure the dagger and calm fears spreading through the barracks.
- [[Einrik Arpaad]] — Commander he tried to counsel.

## Events
- (DR:: 1715-04-27): Advised Brask and Bartoz to contain the dagger; prepared letters to families of the fallen.
- (DR:: 1715-04-28): Killed when the corrupted Sir Einrik turned on the garrison.
- Aftermath: Remembered through surviving letters and testimonies recovered following the fall of the watch.
