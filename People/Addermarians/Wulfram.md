Wulfram was the temple steward of [[The Warlord]] at [[Torvaine Watch]], who urged the containment of the [[Serpentine Dagger]] and is remembered through accounts of the fort’s fall. He tended the chapel and advised the garrison on matters of faith and honor. When the cursed dagger appeared, he urged it be locked away, but was killed in the  confrontation created by the dagger's cursed influence.
