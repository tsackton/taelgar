![[|right|360]]A dairy farmer of [[Fontwick]] who stood her ground during an ankheg attack and helped guide the Addermarch Mercenaries to the farmstead.

## Overview
Samatha operates a dairy farm west of [[Roscombe]] alongside her husband [[Godfrey of Fontwick]]. When an ankheg slaughtered their cattle, she stood her ground while the Addermarch Mercenaries and her husband rode for aid, guiding the group back to the farmstead and helping coordinate the defense.

## Personality
Practical, hospitable, and resilient; treats crises as problems to solve—not reasons to flee. Her gratitude for the Addermarch Mercenaries’ assistance manifested in warmth and generosity, yet she remains determined to rebuild her livelihood through steady work.

## Relationships
- **[[Godfrey of Fontwick]]** – Husband and partner; together they manage the herd and barter with nearby towns.  
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Local ruler whose judgments she trusts; Samatha expected Duval’s agents to respond once warned.  
- Addermarch Mercenaries — Benefactors she now considers friends, repaying them with provisions and heartfelt thanks.

## Events
- (DR:: 1715-05-11): Encountered the Addermarch Mercenaries while fleeing the ankheg’s attack and led them back to the farm.
- (DR:: 1715-05-12): Stood watch during the night battle and received funds from [[Yvan Greenrabbit]] to restock her herd.
- Ongoing: Works to restore the dairy, spreading word of their deeds to neighbors and traders.
