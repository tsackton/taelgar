## Overview
Samatha operates a dairy farm west of [[Roscombe]] alongside her husband [[Godfrey of Fontwick]]. When an ankheg slaughtered their cattle, she stood her ground while the adventurers and her husband rode for aid, guiding the heroes back to the farmstead and helping coordinate the defense.

## Personality & Outlook
Practical, hospitable, and resilient, Samatha treats crises as problems to solve—not reasons to flee. Her gratitude for the party’s assistance manifested in warmth and generosity, yet she remains determined to rebuild her livelihood through steady work.

## Relationships
- **[[Godfrey of Fontwick]]** – Husband and partner; together they manage the herd and barter with nearby towns.  
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Local ruler whose judgments she trusts; Samatha expected Duval’s agents to respond once warned.  
- **Addermarch adventurers** – Benefactors she now considers friends, repaying them with provisions and heartfelt thanks.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-05-11)** – Encounters the party while fleeing the ankheg’s attack and leads them back to the farm.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-12)** – Stands watch during the night battle and receives funds from [[Yvan Greenrabbit]] to restock her herd.  
- **Ongoing** – Works to restore the dairy, spreading word of the heroes’ deeds to neighbors and traders.

%% _DM_ note: Adventure 4 records Samatha sharing cheese, apples, and bread after the ankheg fight and being overwhelmed by Yvan’s 25 gp gift (see [[Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark|Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark]]). %%
