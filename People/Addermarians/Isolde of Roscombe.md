## Overview
Isolde manages the day-to-day affairs of the Temple of the Sibyl in [[Roscombe]], handling visitors, records, and logistics so [[Owen Tavish]] can focus on scholarship and ritual. She keeps the sanctuary secure, curates relics, and ensures sensitive items—such as the cursed [[Serpentine Dagger]]—are catalogued and protected.

## Personality & Outlook
Practical and composed, Isolde prizes order and preparedness. She has little patience for theatrics in sacred spaces, yet treats guests with cordial efficiency. Her calm demeanor steadies the clerical staff during crises, and her meticulous records prove invaluable when odd relics surface.

## Relationships
- **[[Owen Tavish]]** – Superior and collaborator; she manages the temple’s front lines while he pursues research.  
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Works closely to secure Roscombe’s spiritual assets, especially when noble matters intersect temple concerns.  
- **Addermarch adventurers** – Serves as their primary temple contact, arranging meetings and safeguarding artifacts they deliver.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-05-06)** – Welcomes the party to the temple and ushers them to Owen to discuss the Serpentine Dagger.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-08)** – Receives the glowing-poison recipe and oversees its secure transfer to the vault.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-09)** – Helps stage the sanctum for the use of [[Trueflame]], keeping curious congregants at bay during the dagger’s destruction.  
- **Ongoing** – Maintains temple operations, from alms distribution to artifact cataloguing.

%% _DM_ note: Adventure 2 identifies Isolde as the steward ready to lock the Serpentine Dagger in the temple vault while Owen rides south with Sir Gareth (see [[Adventure 2 - Caves of the Cockatrice|Adventure 2 - Caves of the Cockatrice]]). %%
