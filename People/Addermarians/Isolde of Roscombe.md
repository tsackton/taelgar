Isolde is the temple steward of the Temple of the Sibyl in [[Roscombe]]. She manages the day‑to‑day affairs of the Temple of the Sibyl in [[Roscombe]], handling visitors, records, and logistics so [[Owen Tavish]] can focus on scholarship and ritual. She keeps the sanctuary secure, curates relics, and ensures sensitive items—such as the cursed [[Serpentine Dagger]]—are catalogued and protected.

Practical and composed, Isolde prizes order and preparedness. She has little patience for theatrics in sacred spaces, yet treats guests with cordial efficiency. Her calm demeanor steadies the clerical staff during crises, and her meticulous records prove invaluable when odd relics surface.

## Relationships
- **[[Owen Tavish]]** – Priest and collaborator
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Works closely to secure Roscombe’s spiritual assets, especially when noble matters intersect temple concerns.  
- [[Addermarch Mercenaries]] — Serves as their primary temple contact, arranging meetings and safeguarding artifacts they deliver.

## Events
- (DR:: 1715-05-06): Welcomed the [[Addermarch Mercenaries]] to the temple and ushered them to Owen to discuss the Serpentine Dagger.
- (DR:: 1715-05-09): Helped stage the sanctum for the use of [[Trueflame]] to destroy the [[Serpentine Dagger]], keeping curious congregants at bay during the dagger’s destruction.
