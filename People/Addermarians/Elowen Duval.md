## Overview
Lady Elowen Duval governs [[Roscombe]] and its surrounding marches from a manor that doubles as administrative hub and safe haven. A poised stateswoman, she balances frontier threats, trade routes, and noble expectations while cultivating capable agents—including the Addermarch adventurers. Her swift response to the [[Torvaine Watch]] disaster and subsequent commissions reflect a leader intent on stabilizing the region through decisive, well-funded action.

## Personality & Outlook
Elowen is pragmatic and unflappable, favoring diplomacy and delegation over theatrics. She values competence more than pedigree, listens closely to briefings, and pays promptly for results. Beneath her composed demeanor lies a protective streak for Roscombe’s folk, motivating bounty offers, loans to distressed farmers, and public recognition of those who safeguard her domain.

## Relationships
- **Sir [[Gareth Howell]]** – Commanding knight and chief of her household guard; she trusts his field reports and relies on his tactical sense.  
- **[[Owen Tavish]]** – Spiritual adviser whose counsel she seeks on supernatural matters such as the [[Serpentine Dagger]].  
- **Addermarch adventurers** – Emerging troubleshooters she increasingly treats as champions of Roscombe, inviting them to court functions and entrusting sensitive missions.  
- **Roscombe citizenry** – Maintains open channels through stewards and market days, reinforcing her reputation as a hands-on castellan.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-05-01)** – Receives the party’s account of Torvaine Watch, commissions further investigation, and urges consultation with [[Owen Tavish]].  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-02)** – Dispatches a letter formally thanking the heroes and requesting their assistance against new threats.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-04)** – Rewards the return of Duval family jewels recovered from the cockatrice lair.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-07)** – Hosts a manor dinner to coordinate efforts against the Highmoor goblins and hear news of Roscombe’s defenses.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-11)** – Sends support to [[Fontwick]] after word of the ankheg attack reaches Roscombe, reinforcing her commitment to the outlying farms.
