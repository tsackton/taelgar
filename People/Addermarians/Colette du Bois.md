# Colette du Bois

## Overview
Colette du Bois serves as a squire in Lady [[Elowen Duval]]’s household guard, apprenticed to Sir [[Gareth Howell]]. Restless and eager to prove herself, she scouted the goblin tunnels of the [[Highmoor]] ahead of official orders and was captured for her boldness. Freed by the adventurers, she quickly returned to duty, sharing her hard-won knowledge of the western [[Stonewolds]] to aid further expeditions.

## Personality & Outlook
Colette balances knightly discipline with youthful impatience. Stints in the saddle and on patrol have made her practical, but she still hungers for chances to distinguish herself. Her captivity has tempered that drive with a healthier respect for caution, though it has not dimmed her willingness to lend expertise to those defending Roscombe.

## Relationships
- **Sir [[Gareth Howell]]** – Mentor who sanctioned her scouting forays; she strives to regain his full confidence after her capture.  
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Castellan whose approval she values; Colette takes Duval’s requests as personal missions.  
- **Addermarch adventurers** – Grateful to [[Fazoth de Brune]], [[Drou]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit]] for her rescue and happy to share regional lore with them.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-05-08)** – Rescued from the goblin queen’s cells during the assault on the Highmoor lair.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-09)** – Witnesses the destruction of the [[Serpentine Dagger]] at the Temple of the Sibyl.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-10)** – Provides cave-system intelligence in Roscombe, guiding preparations for the Uligium quest.  
- **Ongoing** – Resumes patrol duties and serves as the garrison’s go-to source for Stonewolds trail rumors.

%% _DM_ note: Session 5 prep records Colette’s stat block (AC 15, dagger signature attacks with Weaving Knives/Sneak and Stab) and pronunciation “ko-LET doo BWAH” (see [[Session 5 - DM Notes|Session 5 - DM Notes]]). %%
