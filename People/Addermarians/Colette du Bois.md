Colette Du Bois is a squire of in [[Elowen Duval]]'s household guard, apprenticed to Sir [[Gareth Howell]].
## Overview
Colette du Bois serves as a squire in Lady [[Elowen Duval]]’s household guard, apprenticed to Sir [[Gareth Howell]]. Restless and eager to prove herself, she scouted the goblin tunnels of the [[Highmoor]] ahead of official orders and was captured for her boldness. Freed by the [[Addermarch Mercenaries]], she quickly returned to duty, sharing her hard‑won knowledge of the western [[Stonewolds]] to aid further expeditions.

## Personality
Colette balances knightly discipline with youthful impatience. Stints in the saddle and on patrol have made her practical, but she still hungers for chances to distinguish herself. Her captivity has tempered that drive with a healthier respect for caution, though it has not dimmed her willingness to lend expertise to those defending [[Roscombe]].

## Relationships
- **Sir [[Gareth Howell]]** – Mentor who sanctioned her scouting forays; she strives to regain his full confidence after her capture.  
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Castellan whose approval she values; Colette takes Duval’s requests as personal missions.  
- [[Addermarch Mercenaries]] — Grateful to [[Fazoth de Brune]], [[Drou]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit]] for her rescue and happy to share regional lore with them.

## Events
- (DR:: 1715-04-29): Captured by goblin bandits while scouting in the [[Highmoor]]
- (DR:: 1715-05-08): Rescued from the goblin queen’s cells by the [[Addermarch Mercenaries]] during their assault on the [[Highmoor]] lair.
