# Einrik Arpaad
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> An Addermarian [[Humans|human]] (he/him)

%% cleanup AI-generated content %%
## Overview
Sir Einrik Arpaad commanded [[Torvaine Watch]], the frontier fort guarding Roscombe’s western road. Trusted for decades of service, he fell when the cursed [[Serpentine Dagger]] twisted his will, driving him to slaughter his garrison and, in turn, binding him as the fort’s wrathful ghost. The adventurers escaped his haunt, and cleric [[Owen Tavish]] later laid the spirit to rest, leaving only a cautionary tale about the dagger’s malign influence.

## Personality & Outlook
Einrik was a disciplined soldier who prized duty and order above all. The curse exaggerated those traits into paranoid absolutism, convincing him only he could protect the watch. Even in undeath his spectral vigilance centered on keeping the gates sealed, punishing anyone who touched the dagger or questioned his command.

## Relationships
- **Marshal [[Hildo Brask]]** – Loyal second whose death at Einrik’s hands epitomizes the dagger’s corruption.  
- **[[Bartoz]]** – Smith who opposed the dagger’s presence and ultimately struck Einrik down.  
- **[[Owen Tavish]]** – Priest who faced Einrik’s ghost in prayer and released him from the dagger’s thrall.

## Timeline
- **(Before DR:: 1715-04-28)** – Commands Torvaine Watch through winter storms and rising bandit threats.  
- **(DR:: 1715-04-28)** – Succumbs to the Serpentine Dagger, murders the garrison, and is slain by [[Bartoz]].  
- **(DR:: 1715-04-28)** – Rises as a vengeful spirit that confronts the Addermarch adventurers.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-06)** – Spirit appeased and dispersed by [[Owen Tavish]] with the party’s aid.

%% _DM_ note: Session 2 prep preserves Einrik’s formal note to Lady Duval about executing a nameless mage who refused the toll, underscoring his rigid gatekeeping even before the dagger’s corruption (see [[_DM_/_Addermarch/Session 2 - DM Notes|Session 2 - DM Notes]]). %%
