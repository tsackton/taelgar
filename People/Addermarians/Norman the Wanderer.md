![[|right|360]]A rag‑clad hermit of the western [[Stonewolds]] who trades warnings and guidance for simple provisions, and led the Addermarch Mercenaries to the [[West Stonewolds Caves]].

## Overview
Norman the Wanderer roams the western [[Stonewolds]], living off the land and observing the comings and goings of monsters, hunters, and travelers. He offered to guide the Addermarch Mercenaries to the [[West Stonewolds Caves]], warning them about the ogre—his “double‑big man”—and the wolf that guarded the entrance.

## Personality
Eccentric yet sharp-eyed, Norman jealously guards “his hills” but can be persuaded to help those who show respect. He distrusts civilization’s rules, preferring the freedom and constant watchfulness of the wilds. His speech drifts between rambling stories and unexpectedly precise warnings.

## Relationships
- Addermarch Mercenaries — Values them as capable listeners who paid heed to his cautions; may trade guidance for supplies.  
- **Local farmers and trappers** – Keeps a distant eye on them, occasionally leaving cryptic warnings when danger approaches.  
- **Predators of the Stonewolds** – Treats them as neighbors; sometimes leaves offerings to keep larger beasts away from campsites.

## Events
- (DR:: 1715-05-12): Encountered the Addermarch Mercenaries at their campsite and shared tales of the cave’s monstrous residents.
- (DR:: 1715-05-13): Guided them to the West Stonewolds Caves before vanishing back into the forest.
- Ongoing: Continues patrolling the hills, trading information for food, drink, or simple conversation when it suits him.
