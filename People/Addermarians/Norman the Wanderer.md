## Overview
Norman the Wanderer is a rag-clad hermit who roams the western [[Stonewolds]], living off the land and observing the comings and goings of monsters, hunters, and travelers. He offered to guide the Addermarch adventurers to the [[West Stonewolds Caves]], warning them about the ogre—his “double-big man”—and the wolf that guarded the entrance.

## Personality & Outlook
Eccentric yet sharp-eyed, Norman jealously guards “his hills” but can be persuaded to help those who show respect. He distrusts civilization’s rules, preferring the freedom and constant watchfulness of the wilds. His speech drifts between rambling stories and unexpectedly precise warnings.

## Relationships
- **Addermarch adventurers** – Values them as capable listeners who paid heed to his cautions; may trade guidance for supplies.  
- **Local farmers and trappers** – Keeps a distant eye on them, occasionally leaving cryptic warnings when danger approaches.  
- **Predators of the Stonewolds** – Treats them as neighbors; sometimes leaves offerings to keep larger beasts away from campsites.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-05-12)** – Encounters the party at their campsite and shares tales of the cave’s monstrous residents.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-13)** – Guides them to the West Stonewolds Caves before vanishing back into the forest.  
- **Ongoing** – Continues patrolling the hills, trading information for food, drink, or simple conversation when it suits him.

%% _DM_ note: Adventure 4 describes Norman as an impulsive, tactless hermit shouting “these are my hills,” warning of the “big big big man,” and ultimately guiding the party to the cave (see [[_DM_/_Addermarch/Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark|Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark]]). %%
