# Owen Tavish
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> An Addermarian [[Humans|human]] (he/him)  
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

## Overview
Owen Tavish is the senior priest of [[The Sibyl]] in [[Roscombe]], a scholar of prophecy who pairs pastoral care with research into ancient relics. He trusted the adventurers with the cursed [[Serpentine Dagger]], advising them on safe containment until he could accompany Sir [[Gareth Howell]] to cleanse [[Torvaine Watch]].

## Personality & Outlook
Warm, inquisitive, and quietly competitive (especially at chess), Owen approaches problems as puzzles to be solved with lore, faith, and a dash of humor. He is fascinated by unusual magic but tempers curiosity with respect for divine mysteries. His letters reveal a man who balances urgency with pastoral reassurance.

## Relationships
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Provides counsel on spiritual matters affecting Roscombe’s governance.  
- **[[Isolde of Roscombe]]** – Relies on her stewardship to keep the temple running smoothly.  
- **Addermarch adventurers** – Allies he trusts with dangerous artifacts, seeing in them both courage and a thirst for knowledge.  
- **Sir [[Gareth Howell]]** – Collaborator in frontier missions; Owen accompanies his sorties when holy wards are required.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-05-01)** – Sends a letter urging the party to safeguard the Serpentine Dagger and arrange a meeting upon his return.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-05)** – Rides south with Sir Gareth to lay [[Einrik Arpaad]]’s ghost to rest at Torvaine Watch.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-06)** – Meets with the heroes at the Temple of the Sibyl to examine relics and discuss destroying the dagger.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-09)** – Supervises the application of [[Trueflame]] that finally unmade the Serpentine Dagger.  
- **Ongoing** – Continues cataloguing sacred artifacts and advising on magical anomalies around Roscombe.

%% _DM_ note: Adventure 2 includes Owen’s hurried letter (OH-en TAV-ish) describing his pre-dawn ride to meet Sir Gareth, urging secrecy, and offering to pay for the party’s lodging (see [[Adventure 2 - Caves of the Cockatrice|Adventure 2 - Caves of the Cockatrice]]). %%
