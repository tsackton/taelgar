## Overview
Godfrey runs a dairy farm on the outskirts of [[Fontwick]] with his wife [[Samatha of Fontwick]], supplying cheese and milk to markets as far as [[Roscombe]]. When an ankheg devastated their herd, Godfrey rode hard for Lady [[Elowen Duval]]’s aid, crossing paths with the adventurers who ultimately slew the creature.

## Personality & Outlook
Level-headed and community-minded, Godfrey meets crises with action rather than panic. He trusts Roscombe’s leadership to safeguard the frontier, yet he will risk himself if it means keeping his neighbors and family secure.

## Relationships
- **[[Samatha of Fontwick]]** – Wife and partner in the family dairy; he defers to her practical wisdom on farm matters.  
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Local ruler whose justice he respects enough to petition directly.  
- **Addermarch adventurers** – Grateful for their swift defense of his farmstead.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-05-11)** – Encounters the party while fleeing the ankheg attack and rides to Roscombe to alert Lady Duval.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-12)** – Returns home to find the monster dead and his wife supported with coin and supplies.  
- **Ongoing** – Continues rebuilding the herd and spreading word of the heroes’ intervention.

%% _DM_ note: “Into the Underdark” prep flags Godfrey as the dairy farmer who raises the alarm while Samatha guides the heroes during the ankheg encounter (see [[_DM_/_Addermarch/Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark|Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark]]). %%
