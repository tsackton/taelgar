![[|right|360]]A dairy farmer of [[Fontwick]] who sought aid after an ankheg devastated his herd, crossing paths with the Addermarch Mercenaries.

## Overview
Godfrey runs a dairy farm on the outskirts of [[Fontwick]] with his wife [[Samatha of Fontwick]], supplying cheese and milk to markets as far as [[Roscombe]]. When an ankheg devastated their herd, Godfrey rode hard for Lady [[Elowen Duval]]’s aid, crossing paths with the Addermarch Mercenaries who ultimately slew the creature.

## Personality
Level‑headed and community‑minded; meets crises with action rather than panic. He trusts Roscombe’s leadership to safeguard the frontier, yet he will risk himself if it means keeping his neighbors and family secure.

## Relationships
- **[[Samatha of Fontwick]]** – Wife and partner in the family dairy; he defers to her practical wisdom on farm matters.  
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Local ruler whose justice he respects enough to petition directly.  
- Addermarch Mercenaries — Grateful for their swift defense of his farmstead.

## Events
- (DR:: 1715-05-11): Encountered the Addermarch Mercenaries while fleeing the ankheg attack and rode to Roscombe to alert Lady Duval.
- (DR:: 1715-05-12): Returned home to find the monster dead and his wife supported with coin and supplies.
- Ongoing: Continues rebuilding the herd and spreading word of their intervention.
