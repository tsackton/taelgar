## Overview
Bartoz served as the master smith and informal quartermaster of [[Torvaine Watch]], keeping the garrison’s arms battle-ready and the gate winches oiled even through winter storms. When the cursed [[Serpentine Dagger]] surfaced, he insisted it be locked away and sought temple steward [[Wulfram]]’s guidance. Sir [[Einrik Arpaad]] fell to the weapon’s malice regardless, and Bartoz paid with his life stopping his commander’s rampage—only to rise again as the fort’s undead smith until the adventurers cut him down.

## Personality & Outlook
Plainspoken and dutiful, Bartoz valued discipline over rank and looked first to the welfare of the ordinary soldiers. He distrusted strange magic, preferring to consult priests before risking arcane tools, yet when the watch faltered he confronted the crisis head-on. Even in undeath he clung to the forge, a grim echo of the responsibility he refused to abandon.

## Relationships
- **[[Wulfram]]** – Spiritual confidant who helped him quarantine the dagger.  
- **Marshal [[Hildo Brask]]** – Partner in garrison logistics; Brask’s death hardened Bartoz’s resolve.  
- **Sir [[Einrik Arpaad]]** – Commander he respected until the curse forced Bartoz to strike him down.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-04-18)** – Mortally wounds Sir Einrik while defending Torvaine Watch and falls in the smithy.  
- **(DR:: 1715-04-28)** – Undead remains defeated by [[Fazoth de Brune]], [[Drou]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit]] during the watch’s liberation.  
- **(DR:: 1715-04-30)** – Lady [[Elowen Duval]] recounts Bartoz’s sacrifice, cementing his legacy in [[Roscombe]].

## Legacy & Hooks
- Torvaine’s surviving families may seek to recover Bartoz’s masterwork tools—or a journal hidden in the smithy’s rubble.  
- Rumors in Roscombe cast him as either a tragic guardian or a lingering revenant, inviting future adventurers to set the story straight.

%% _DM_ note: Bartoz’s unfinished letter (see [[_DM_/_Addermarch/Session 2 - DM Notes|Session 2 - DM Notes]]) recalls his grandfather reforging a warhammer into a smith’s hammer, his plan to melt the dagger in his furnace, and his suspicion that Wulfram never left Torvaine Watch as Sir Arpaad claimed. %%
