%% DM (campaign references and conflicts)
- Source conflict: Gazetteer/Greater Sembara/Addermarch/Haldrenn notes Olay was gored by his own boar, while session material and this note record death by enraged bull. Retain both as reported; boar vs. bull unresolved.
- Additional context: Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 11.md mentions villagers preparing Olay’s funeral and a “Hollow Men” rhyme linked to the [[Morlaith|Briarheart]].
