Caradoc is alchemist and scholar, who lives by himself in an isolated hamlet near the small village of [[Brantor]], outside [[Roscombe]]. He is has neatly trimmed white hair, a short well-groomed beard, and is going a little bald on the top of his head, but otherwise does not seem to be particularly old or frail despite his age. His piercing green eyes are always alert, and walks and speaks with purpose. He dresses plainly, in carefully mended brown robes. 

Caradoc has a wide reputation across much of [[Carlinshire]] as a skilled alchemist. He rarely sells his potions and concoctions, though is free with gold to pay those who bring him alchemical materials. It is rumored he is fabulously wealthy from adventures in his youth, though no one has ever claimed to have seen this reputed treasure. 

%% NOTES

Additional rumors that may circulate:
- he is actually hundreds of years old, and a fey lord
- he is recruiting mercenaries to send for strange monstrosities in the Plaguelands
- he once returned a young woman from the dead, but when she awoke she found her body had the form of a dwarf
- he was betrayed by a trickster fey who pretended to work for him and then stole his magic
- he once saved the entire village of Brantor from a terrible plague by crafting a cure from rare ingredients gathered from the dangerous Plaguelands
- he is secretly a protector of the realm and a powerful member of the Rangers, and recruits mercenaries to train them for this noble duty
- he can speak to animals, and the birds and beasts of the forest are his spies, watching everyone who comes near his home.

Backstory:

Caradoc was born the year the Third Hobgoblin War ended, and grew up in the prosperity of the Peace of Circe. 

From a young age, however, he was marked by the fey. As a teenager, he traveled to the Feywild and into the realm of [[Morlaith]], where something happened. He won't speak of this (details TBD). 

But, he emerged with an uncanny ability to see alchemical reactions, and prematurely white hair. 

Over the past forty years, he has quietly looked for signs of trouble with Morlaith, trying to keep rumors out of the ears of the Earl of Westcliff and the lord of the manor at Roscombe. 

The exact reason for this is not yet determined, but likely has to do with some secret knowledge, possibly something he stole from the Feywild that he does not want examined too closely. 

For the purposes of the adventure:
- Caradoc is very connected to rumors of fey
- Caradoc wants to deal with these troubles quietly, without involving the authorities
- Definitely seems to be on the side of the rural people of [[Carlinshire]], but might seem a little old fashioned. Cares about maintaining the "old ways" for example.
