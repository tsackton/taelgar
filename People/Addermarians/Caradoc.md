- Piercing green eyes
- Walks and speaks purposefully
- Has a reputation as a skilled alchemist, but never lets anyone into his home, which is isolated about a 30 minute walk from the village (Brantor), and about a 4 hour walk from town (Roscombe)

	- he was betrayed by a trickster fey who pretended to work for him and then stole his magic
	- he once saved the entire village of Brantor from a terrible plague by crafting a cure from rare ingredients gathered from the dangerous Plaguelands
	- he is secretly a protector of the realm and a powerful member of the Rangers, and recruits mercenaries to train them for this noble duty
	- he can speak to animals, and the birds and beasts of the forest are his spies, watching everyone who comes near his home.
