## Overview
Caradoc is a reclusive alchemist who maintains a cottage laboratory outside [[Brantor]], trading coin and commissions for rare reagents while keeping his discoveries close. Despite his sixty-plus years, he moves with crisp focus, white hair cut short and green eyes always measuring the worth of a sample. He bankrolls expeditions rather than travelling himself, relying on proven adventurers to secure exotic ingredients such as cockatrice gizzards, the glowing-poison recipe stolen by goblins, and the living mineral [[Uligium]].

## Personality & Outlook
Pragmatic, exacting, and politely distant, Caradoc weighs every bargain against the risks of stirring up fey or frontier politics. He dislikes drawing attention to his work, preferring discreet operatives and prompt results. Though rumors paint him as fabulously wealthy—or secretly fey-touched—he lives simply and treats alchemy as both scholarly calling and civic duty, rewarding competence with generous pay.

## Relationships
- **Addermarch adventurers** – Employs [[Fazoth de Brune]], [[Drou]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit]] for hazardous ingredient retrievals, trusting their reliability.  
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Maintains a cordial distance from Roscombe’s court, preferring to keep noble oversight out of his dealings.  
- **Local farmers and traders** – Sources of gossip and raw materials; he repays information with fair coin rather than tinctures.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-05-02)** – Hires the party to slay a cockatrice and procure its gizzard as proof of capability.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-08)** – Exchanges Trueflame for the reclaimed glowing-poison recipe after the goblin queen’s fall.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-09)** – Commissions an Uligium expedition, briefing the party on deep-cave hazards.  
- **(Ongoing)** – Acts as a discreet patron for frontier threats too small—or too delicate—to involve Roscombe’s soldiery.

%% _DM_ note: Prep notes describe Caradoc’s Sunday stays at the Raven’s Roost, his habit of scouting “oddities” like the Haldrenn rumors, and his escalation to deeper cave contracts (see [[_DM_/_Addermarch/Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark|Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark]] and [[_DM_/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey Incursion|Adventure 5 - Fey Incursion]]). %%

%% NOTES

Additional rumors that may circulate:
- he is actually hundreds of years old, and a fey lord
- he is recruiting mercenaries to send for strange monstrosities in the Plaguelands
- he once returned a young woman from the dead, but when she awoke she found her body had the form of a dwarf
- he was betrayed by a trickster fey who pretended to work for him and then stole his magic
- he once saved the entire village of Brantor from a terrible plague by crafting a cure from rare ingredients gathered from the dangerous Plaguelands
- he is secretly a protector of the realm and a powerful member of the Rangers, and recruits mercenaries to train them for this noble duty
- he can speak to animals, and the birds and beasts of the forest are his spies, watching everyone who comes near his home.

Backstory:

Caradoc was born the year the Third Hobgoblin War ended, and grew up in the prosperity of the Peace of Circe. 

From a young age, however, he was marked by the fey. As a teenager, he traveled to the Feywild and into the realm of [[Morlaith]], where something happened. He won't speak of this (details TBD). 

But, he emerged with an uncanny ability to see alchemical reactions, and prematurely white hair. 

Over the past forty years, he has quietly looked for signs of trouble with Morlaith, trying to keep rumors out of the ears of the Earl of Westcliff and the lord of the manor at Roscombe. 

The exact reason for this is not yet determined, but likely has to do with some secret knowledge, possibly something he stole from the Feywild that he does not want examined too closely. 

For the purposes of the adventure:
- Caradoc is very connected to rumors of fey
- Caradoc wants to deal with these troubles quietly, without involving the authorities
- Definitely seems to be on the side of the rural people of [[Carlinshire]], but might seem a little old fashioned. Cares about maintaining the "old ways" for example.
