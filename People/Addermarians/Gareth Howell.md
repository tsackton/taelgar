## Overview
Sir Gareth Howell leads Lady [[Elowen Duval]]’s household guard, patrolling the roads between [[Roscombe]] and [[Torvaine Watch]] and coordinating local militia responses. He first met the adventurers while investigating the watch’s silence, and quickly pressed their talents into service against roaming goblins and other frontier perils. Gareth balances knightly discipline with pragmatic field sense, valuing any ally who keeps Roscombe safe.

## Personality & Outlook
Gareth is duty-driven, thoughtful, and measured. He listens before acting, but once convinced, moves decisively. Years of defending border villages have made him wary of rash heroics; he prizes preparation, reliable intelligence, and the welfare of his people, especially the squires and scouts under his command.

## Relationships
- **Lady [[Elowen Duval]]** – Castellan he serves with loyalty; he executes her directives while offering candid assessments of regional threats.  
- **[[Colette du Bois]]** – Squire he mentors; her capture by goblins reinforced his protective instincts toward trainees.  
- **Addermarch adventurers** – Partners he now trusts after their success at Torvaine Watch and the goblin lair; he channels missions their way when official forces are stretched thin.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-04-30)** – Encounters the party south of [[Roscombe]] while marching to relieve Torvaine Watch.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-07)** – Shares intelligence over Lady Duval’s dinner, requesting aid for the missing squire and goblin stronghold.  
- **(DR:: 1715-05-08)** – Receives news of Colette’s rescue and the recovery of the stolen poison recipe.  
- **Ongoing** – Oversees Roscombe’s patrols and monitors threats emerging from the [[Highmoor]] and [[Stonewolds]].

%% _DM_ note: Session 2 prep tags Sir Gareth Howell (GAR-eth HOW-ell) as the knight leading the relief column that meets the party, establishing his role in Roscombe’s command (see [[Session 2 - DM Notes|Session 2 - DM Notes]]). %%
