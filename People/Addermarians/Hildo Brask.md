![[|right|360]]Marshal of [[Torvaine Watch]] and second to Sir [[Einrik Arpaad]], remembered for steady leadership during the fort’s last days.

## Overview
Marshal Hildo Brask served as Sir Einrik’s second, overseeing discipline, patrol schedules, and the garrison’s morale. As the Serpentine Dagger’s curse spread through the fort, Brask tried to keep order and coordinate with [[Wulfram]] and [[Bartoz]]; he was murdered when the dagger took hold of Einrik.

## Personality
Devout and steadfast; led by example, drilled recruits, and leaned on faith—symbolized by the holy emblem that kept his corpse from rising with the rest of the fallen.

## Relationships
- [[Einrik Arpaad]] — Commander he supported until the dagger’s corruption.
- [[Bartoz]] — Collaborated on keeping the watch supplied; Bartoz’s report on the dagger was among Brask’s final acts.
- [[Wulfram]] — Religious adviser; together they urged caution about the cursed relic.

## Events
- (DR:: 1715-04-27): Debated the fate of the dagger with Wulfram and supported securing it.
- (DR:: 1715-04-28): Killed by the corrupted Sir Einrik while defending Torvaine Watch.
- (DR:: 1715-04-28): Body recovered and honored by the Addermarch Mercenaries before leaving the fort.
