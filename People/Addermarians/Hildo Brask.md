# Hildo Brask
>[!info]+ Biographical Info  
> An Addermarian [[Humans|human]] (he/him)

%% cleanup AI-generated content %%
## Overview
Marshal Hildo Brask served as Sir [[Einrik Arpaad]]’s second at [[Torvaine Watch]], overseeing discipline, patrol schedules, and the garrison’s morale. As the Serpentine Dagger’s curse spread through the fort, Brask tried to keep order and coordinate with [[Wulfram]] and [[Bartoz]]; he was murdered when the dagger took hold of Einrik.

## Personality & Outlook
Devout and steadfast, Brask was known for steady leadership rather than flair. He led by example, spent evenings drilling recruits, and leaned on faith—symbolized by the holy emblem that kept his corpse from rising with the rest of the fallen.

## Relationships
- **Sir [[Einrik Arpaad]]** – Commander he supported until Einrik’s possession turned them adversarial.  
- **[[Bartoz]]** – Collaborated on keeping the watch supplied; Bartoz’s report on the dagger was one of Brask’s final acts.  
- **[[Wulfram]]** – Religious adviser; together they urged caution about the cursed relic.

## Timeline
- **(DR:: 1715-04-27)** – Debates the fate of the dagger with Wulfram and supports securing it.  
- **(DR:: 1715-04-28)** – Killed by the corrupted Sir Einrik while defending Torvaine Watch.  
- **(DR:: 1715-04-28)** – Body recovered and honored by the adventurers before leaving the fort.

%% _DM_ note: Session 1’s unfinished condolence letter from Brask to Piri’s sister shows his compassion—pooling coin for the family and sending along a carved keepsake (see [[Session 1 - DM Notes|Session 1 - DM Notes]]). %%
