Hildo is the marshal of [[Torvaine Watch]]. He serves as Sir Einrik’s second, overseeing discipline, patrol schedules, and the garrison’s morale. As the Serpentine Dagger’s curse spread through the fort, Brask tried to keep order and coordinate with [[Wulfram]] and [[Bartoz]]; he was murdered when the dagger took hold of Einrik. Devout and steadfast, he led by example and relied on his faith in [[The Mother]].

## Relationships
- [[Einrik Arpaad]] — Commander he supported until the dagger’s corruption.
- [[Bartoz]] — Collaborated on keeping the watch supplied; Bartoz’s report on the dagger was among Brask’s final acts.
- [[Wulfram]] — Religious adviser; together they urged caution about the cursed relic.

## Events
- (DR:: 1715-04-18): Killed by the corrupted Sir Einrik while defending Torvaine Watch.
- (DR:: 1715-04-28): [[Addermarch - Session 02|Body recovered]] and honored by the [[Addermarch Mercenaries ]]before leaving the fort.
