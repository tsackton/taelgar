# Tulvak

A sailor and ferry captain, a man of 30. Expert sailor, and for a long time served as the captain of the ferry that would take pilgrims from Pyhlla to Vetta. Knows the coast of Vetta like the back of his hand. 

Was on Vetta during Urgall the Black's attack, and was the only survivor. Not sure if it was fate or luck: he was outside pissing when the fireballs began to fly, and fled watching the longhouse burn with all the pilgrims inside. Still carries the trauma of that night.
