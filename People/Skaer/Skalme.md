Skalme is the Priestess of Fire, the divine protector of the elemental fire, the volcano known as  Kuaine (coo-ine-a), on the Skaer volcanic island of [[Antaka]]. She is a powerful divine magic user. 

She is a very tall, dark skinned woman, with bright red facial tattoos in place of the blue that most priests wear.
