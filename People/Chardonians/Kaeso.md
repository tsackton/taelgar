[[Kenzo]]'s mentor and friend. A Chardonian, but widely traveled. Former student of [[Roscelia]] and member of the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], but expelled for keeping secrets, specifically about Dunmari magic. 

Secretly a member of the [[Shakun Mystai]]. 

%% One Note

## Two-Note Summary
 
**Purpose:** ally to Kenzo, information-giver and supporter  
**Trait (Value):** The exploitation and commercialization of magic in Chardon is a mistake. This manifests both in his doubts about the Society of the Open Scroll and its mission to learn everything about everything; and in his concern about the influence of chalyte on the imperial side of things.
 
Kenzo's mentor/patron/protector in Chardon. Lives in the Panemsgate neighborhood, south of the Kylos market.
 
Trained at the university, including higher learning from the faculty of Magic, but never a great caster [he is probably something like a level 3-5 melee bard], more an adventurer type, "practical magician". After his training, left to seek knowledge elsewhere, eventually ending up in Karawa and joining the Shakun Mystai.
 
When he returned, he refused to speak of his travels, holding is oath to the Mystai sacred. Was expelled from the Society of the Open Scroll for this, and left the academy, although retains some old contacts, especially his master from his university days, Roscelia.
 
## Appearance
 
In his late 50s - some wrinkles but still a lively face, scraggly black hair, and a few day's stubble. Olive skin, plain dress.
 
## Mannerisms
 
Uses his hands a lot - for emphasis, also to pull people close, create space.
 
## Motives
 
He is fully on Kenzo's side, just wants him to thrive. Has already burned most of his bridges in the academy so not concerned about burning more.
 
He still respects some people in the Society and especially at the University, but can't agree with the combination of arrogance and passivity - wishes the Hetaeri Magica and others would take a more active role against the chalyte trade, instead of just looking down on it. Even maybe helping those who burn themselves out using it, doing something to stop overdoses and deaths.
 
But these days his focus and concern is really on the political side of things -- control of the chalyte trade consolidated under the Auratan family has given them too much power.
