A barbarian. A huge Chardonian man, muscled and over 6 feet tall. Silent. Does not wear any armor, just a simple sailorâ€™s cloak, and carries a clearly well-loved and dangerous-looking halberd. 

According to [[Marcella]], he was once a sweet sailor with a beautiful singing voice, but was turned somehow by [[Kadmos]] and now is his devoted servant.
