A Chardonian adventurer, treasure hunter, and sellsword. Rescued by the party from imprisonment in Raven's Hold. 

Vola was born on the streets of [[Chardon]], living a life of squalor, disease, and poverty. Grew up in the Riverside slurms, near the chalyte refineries. Eventually discovered by [[Agon]], who helped her grow into her power and fulfill her potential. 

Dedicated to the cause of the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], but friendly with the party and especially [[Kenzo]], given their similar childhoods.
