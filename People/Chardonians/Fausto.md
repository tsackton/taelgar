A poweful enchanter and a major funder of treasure hunters associated with the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], and also apparently a member of a secret organization called [[The Cleansed]]. 

Funded many of the expeditions across [[Dunmar]], including [[Kadmos]] and company (rumored); [[Servius]]; and [[Dee Wildcloak]], [[Dain Goldhammer]], and [[Alban]]'s expedition to [[Stormcaller Tower]]. Probably also funded [[Arcus]], given that he traveled with many of these people. 

Tricked the party, attempting to capture or kill them when they came to his tower to make an exchange for [[Hralgar's Eyes]].
