A boy of about 5, who lives with his mother, [[Livia]], in the village of [[Luminatia]], near [[Lake Valandros]] in the [[Chardonian Empire]]. He found a stone, in which he believes his imaginary friend Benji lives, in his [[Claudio|father's]] study, after his father abandoned the family. 

- (DR:: 1749-01-08) Lucius' imaginary friend Benji spoke to him from the stone he carries, and asked him about his life.
