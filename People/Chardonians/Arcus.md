An adventurer and treasure hunter from the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], found petrified in the fort east of [[Gomat]]. 

Left Chardon with [[Servius]], [[Dee Wildcloak]], [[Dain Goldhammer]], and [[Alban]]. Argued constantly with [[Servius]], acording to [[Dee Wildcloak]]. Parted ways with other travelers in [[Songara]], presumably to press ahead. 

Passed through Karawa alone in late February or early March, according to [[Jasu]] and [[Ikram]].
