A showman, scholar, academic rival of sorts to [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]], and member of the Faculty of Magic at the [[University of Chardon]]. 

Known for elaborate lectures on the magic of the planes, with a particular focus on elemental magic. The party saw a lecture in [[Session 49 (DuFr)]]. 

Had possessed the [[Chalice of the Runepriest]], but sold it to [[Riswynn]] for a large sum of money in [[Session 49 (DuFr)]].
