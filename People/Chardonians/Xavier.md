A childhood friend of [[Kenzo]]'s, Xavier lost his father to a refinery accident and was drawn into the [[chalyte]] trade at a young age to supplement the income his family got from mending and piece-work sewing. A street tough from his youth, now often serves as hired muscle for the [[Eightfold Flame]]. 

He lives with his mother and sister in a small apartment near the [[Foundry Market]].
