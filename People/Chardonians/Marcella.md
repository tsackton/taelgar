### Marcella

A nondescript Chardonian woman, short brown hair and a plain face. An archer, skilled with a bow, wears well-tended leather armor under a traveling cloak. 

Traveled uneasily with [[Kadmos]], [[Hektor]], [[Casian]], and [[Antonia]]. 

Felt forced to try to steal from party in [[Session 44]], but when given the push by [[Wellby]] to flee for herself at the end of battle figures out how to make her escape. Disappears when [[Kadmos]] and company are fighting kobolds in the [[Myraeni Gap]], heading for the Stoneborn and then Sembara.
