An elderly magician, prim and proper, a member of the Faculty of Magic at the [[University of Chardon]] and [[Kaeso]]'s mentor.

Still somewhat friendly with [[Kaeso]], despite her disappointment in his path and refusal to share secrets with the [[Society of the Open Scroll]]. 

%% One Note

**Trait (Personality/Belief**): excessively polite, proper, clings to the proper forms and protocols as a way to avoid dealing with politics
 
Title: Roscelia Verinus, Professor of Magic, Argent Chair of Theurgy
 
Kaeso's old teacher, on the faculty of Magic at the University of Chardon but mostly retired from teaching. Definitely has some wizard levels. A member of the Hetaeri Magica as well as the University. Not associated with Great Library, but is a member of the Society of the Open Scroll. Disappointed in Kaeso but still likes him as a friend, and they have mostly agreed to disagree about his experiences.
 
## Appearance
 
Older woman, probably 70 or so, refined features, sharp nose. Gray hair tied up in a bun, elegantly dressed, with jewelry that shows off wealth - wearing a long string of pearls around her neck, and diamond earrings.
 
## Mannerisms
 
Polite, proper. Think like the grandmother from Dowton Abby or something. Will expect the proper forms to be made, and not to be rushed.
 
## Motives/Challenges
 
She will be inclined to be friendly if the party is polite and doesn't seem impatient or put out or rude, and is always willing to do a favor for Kaeso as long as it does not involve his "wild ideas".
 
She can be easily charmed by a gracious and "proper" approach, especially with a bit of flattery and buying into the ritual. But rude, hostile, or rushed conversation will get the party the cold shoulder.
 
Perfectly willing to speak of Galen and (if she finds the party polite and charming) would be happy to invite him over to meet them at a gathering. Certainly knows about the Chalice.
