>> %%^Campaign:DuFr%% Imprisoned by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] on December 8th, 1748, in the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], [[Uzgukhar]], [[Xurkhaz]] %%^End%%

A lanky, red-haired Chardonian woman, wearing a probably-magical heavy suit of plate armor that seems perfectly molded to fit her body. 

Seemed to have mixed feelings about [[Kadmos]] actions to charm the party in [[Session 44 (DuFr)]], and was not involved in the battle in [[Session 45 (DuFr)]]. 

As far as you know, still traveling with [[Kadmos]].
