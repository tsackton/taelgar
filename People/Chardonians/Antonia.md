>> %%^Campaign:DuFr%% Imprisoned with the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] on <target> The Mirror of Soul Trapping, Vindristjarna, Uzgukhar, Xurkhaz, The Garamjala Desert, Nashtkar, The Desolation of Cha'mutte %%^End%%

A lanky, red-haired Chardonian woman, wearing a probably-magical heavy suit of plate armor that seems perfectly molded to fit her body. 

Seemed to have mixed feelings about [[Kadmos]] actions to charm the party in [[Session 44 (DuFr)]], and was not involved in the battle in [[Session 45 (DuFr)]]. 

As far as you know, still traveling with [[Kadmos]].
