General Soria Caronius is the current commander of the [[~Voltara East Border Fort~]], the northeastern-most fortification in the [[Chardonian Empire]]. 

She is a middle aged woman, heavily armored and tough, with a bit of a chip on her shoulder about the challenges and value of defending this forgotten corner of the world.

DM notes

In DR 1747, during Grumella's War, the eastern defenses were neglected as resources shifted to Voltara and the chalyte trade, and Soria was somewhat overwhelmed by the challenges arising from [[Nymthrax]]'s territory to the north. The [[Silver Tempests]] aided her in dealing with [[Great Library Session Notes - Arc 4|bullywug troubles and ultimately Nymthrax]], but did not spend much time talking to her.
