# Kadmos
>[!info]+ Biographical Summary
>human (Chardonian), he/him
>`$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PageDatedValue", {"currentYear" : (dv.current().yearOverride ? dv.current().yearOverride : FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0].current.year)})`
>> Based in: [[Chardon]], [[Chardonian Empire]]
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_CurrentWhereabouts", {"config": await app.vault.adapter.read(app.vault.configDir + "/taelgarConfig.json")})`

A mysterious figure who doesn't speak unless necessary, the leader of this company, with [[Hektor]], [[Marcella]], [[Antonia]], and [[Casian]]. 

A tall Chardonian man, cloaked and hooded, wearing dark, travel-stained leather armor, without obvious weapons. A spellcaster, who took on an undead visage in combat and whose spirit seems touched by a darkness. 

A character of dubious morality, clearly willing and able to use enchantment magic to get what he wants, and happy to provoke a fight.
