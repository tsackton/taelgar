A mysterious figure who doesn't speak unless necessary, the leader of this company, with [[Hektor]], [[Marcella]], [[Antonia]], and [[Casian]]. 

A tall Chardonian man, cloaked and hooded, wearing dark, travel-stained leather armor, without obvious weapons. A spellcaster, who took on an undead visage in combat and whose spirit seems touched by a darkness. 

A character of dubious morality, clearly willing and able to use enchantment magic to get what he wants, and happy to provoke a fight.
