%% add campaign info, reformat text to isolate campaign stuff, check and see if secrets still need to be secret%%

A Chardonian wizard on loan to the Dunmari army of [[Nayan Karnas]], commanded by [[Illyan]], in [[Tokra]]. 

Does not particularly like the party given their attempt to scry on [[Illyan]], which Drusa detected, and their refusal to agree to simple magic protocols.
