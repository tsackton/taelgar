# Dustthorn Horde

The group of orcs gathered under the leadership of Agata Dustmother, who served as her allies and servants when needed, and were in turn supported by her in the desert. 

After Agata was killed in DR 1748, the Dustthorn Horde largely disbanded. Some remnants attacked the Dunmari border in fall DR 1748, desperate for food, and were defeated.
