# The Fraternity of the Empty Moon

A werewolf cult, originally based outside [[Tokra]] but driven from the city during [[The Exile of Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] in the DR 1610s. 

Returned, with [[Agata]]'s aid, in DR 1748, with a goal to draw the power of [[Pandemonium]] closer to Taelgar, which was foiled by the party.
