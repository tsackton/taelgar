![[cateline.png|right|400]]Cateline is a prominent member of the [[The Rangers]], a devotee of the [[Fox and Hunter]], and a guardian of the secrets of [[Isingue]], widely regarded as a spiritual leader on the [[Aurbez Plateau]]. She is closely associated with the guardianship of the [[Heartroot]] and is known for the rite of “water before words” observed at councils in [[Three Wells]]. Her guidance blends pragmatic defense with reverence for the land’s old blessings.

She is a middle-aged woman, sinewy, with dark skin and braided black-silver hair. She typically wears a weathered cloak over plain mail; a beryl bead on thong; and carries iron-ferruled staff.
