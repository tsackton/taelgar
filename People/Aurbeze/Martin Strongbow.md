![[martin.png|right|400]]Martin is an Isinguer human and a captain of the [[The Rangers]]. He is a a seasoned tactician and often serves as the coordinator of Ranger operations within the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]].

## Background

Martin was the eldest son of wildcat miners on the northern edge of the [[Aurbez Plateau]], raised with stories of his [[Isingue|Isinguer]] heritage. He grew up poor, and joined [[The Rangers]] young, with a zeal for the cause of [[Isingue]] instilled by his parents. Although sometimes rash, his brilliant tactical acumen and daring style served him; he led numerous raids into the ash storms of the [[Plaguelands]] during his 20s, making a name for himself across the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]]. 

More recently, he has honed a reputation for disciplined scouting and clear‑headed command. Within [[The Rangers]] he is very popular with the rank-and-file, and widely deferred to on questions of deployment, timing, and the use of irregular forces. His leadership emphasizes mobility, concealment, and decisive strikes, though at times he is too eager to hear all sides and encourage lengthy discussion. 

Martin is a well-built, dashing man in his 30s, with dark hair and a tidy beard. He generally wears chain mail and a river-green cloak.
