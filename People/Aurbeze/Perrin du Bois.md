![[perrin-du-bois.png|right|400]]Perrin is an Aurbeze beekeeper, father of four, and smallholder, elected to represent the scattered smallholds and isolated farms across the [[Aurbez Plateau]] in Alliance councils. 

Perrin advocates for rural households and waterâ€‘rights concerns, lending a steady if anxious voice to Alliance deliberations. He is regarded as a practical delegate who presses for civilian safety and realistic defenses for outlying farms.

Perrin is rarely seen without his straw hat, and has a weathered look of someone who works the land for a living. 

## Events
- (DR:: 1749-08-07): Joined the war council at [[Three Wells]], where he cautioned against plans that gambled civilian safety on uncertain outcomes, while acknowledging the need to protect the [[Heartroot]].
