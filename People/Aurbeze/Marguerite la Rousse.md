![[marguerite-la-rousse.png|right|400]]Marguerite is an Aurbeze militia captain and capable fighter, formerly a highland shepherd on the [[Aurbez Plateau]]. She commands respect among the plateau militias, bringing practical experience and resolve to local defense. Her leadership emphasizes endurance, coordination with the [[The Rangers]], and protection of rural households.

She is a sun-browned woman with red hair, typically wearing her worn but carefully maintained brigandine armor. She carries an ash halberd and often wears a homespun scarf knotted like a banner.
## Events
- (DR:: 1749-08-07): Joined the war council in [[Three Wells]], called to answer the [[Empress of Chaos]], where she argued for resistance and for defending the plateau approaches.
