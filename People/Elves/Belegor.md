Belegor is a solitary [[Elves]] wander, who has travelled across the forests of the western region of Taelgar for many years, not wanting hide in isolation as many of his generation chose after The [[Great War]]. 
## Overview

Belegor is an [[Elves]] of the 36th ka, the generation that came of age during the [[Great War]]. He chose to wander in his later years, after fathering children, and is driven by a sense of wanderlust but also melancholy for what was lost. 
## Description

Belegor is a tall, ageless [[Elves]], with medium length copper hair, pale skin, and green eyes. He wears elegant clothes in greens and yellows, with high collar and long, wide sleeves. Graceful.
## Events

- In DR 1748, Belegor met the green dragon [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]], who was posing as an [[Elves]], [[Mezzar]], at the time, in [[Elderwood|the Elderwood]]. Realizing the deception, he fled, hiding in a [[Te'kula]] village. Here, he met [[The Dunmar Fellowship]].
