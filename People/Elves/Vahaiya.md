![[vahaiya-portrait.png|right|400]]Vahaiya is a warrior, traveler, adventurer, and veteran of the [[Great War]]. They fought with the Sembaran Army in the in the [[Battle of Urlich Pass]], and survived. After the Great War, they traveled extensively around [[Addermarch]], the [[Aurbez Plateau]], [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], and other Sembaran borderlands for many years. They made a name for themselves in the Sembaran hobgoblin wars.

![[vahaiya-2.jpg|right|400]] %% notes below
A well-connected collector of elven painting, of the 36th ka. They survived the Great War, fighting alongside Sembarans in the Battle of [[Urlich Pass]]. After the war, could not settle, and did not return to have children during his first mela. Traveled and fought with the rangers for a time, spent time around Massau, Addermarch, fighting hobgoblins, until by 1700 was tired of fighting. Had amassed some considerable skill in arms, and favors and knowledge from a wide swath of people, including many rangers. Word of their deeds spread, and returns to [[Orenlas]] - which is particularly close to Addermarch - in the early 1700s, tired, feeling out of cycle, uncertain about having missed their first mela, wanting the strength of Aldanor's roots just as Elmerca's winds are scattering the newly awakened elves of the small and uncertain 37th ka. Decides to stay in [[Orenlas]]. Given their fame, attracts a number of gifts, and finds particular joy in painting. Even has one of Beryl's paintings, a very rare piece if not particularly amazingly crafted, and a gift from the Rangers. 

 the elf, a skilled fighter, proud of their bow and clearly quite good with it. They tell you several tales of the Great War, especially the [[Battle of Urlich Pass]], when it seemed like an endless horde of hobgoblins would overwhelm the elven and Sembaran armies, until the earth and mountains shook as the great skeletal dragon Cha'mutte died, and everyone hobgoblin and human and elf alike fled from the battle as the mountains started to fall. They also tell smaller stories, of their attempts at painting, of a victory over a dust creature on the plains south of Cleenseau (you gather they have some magical ability related to their bow, as part of this story). They also tell of the fine walking in the woods of Addermarch, of the kindness of Marcel de Valarin, a paladin of the Wanderer who spent much time in the 1660s and 1670s in the northern reaches of Maseau, trying to help the war torn land recover. They speak highly of the order he founded, the Order of the Charitable Wanderer.
