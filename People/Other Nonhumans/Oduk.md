Oduk is a demon created with the ability to corrupt animals into gnolls. 

%% Potentially one of the many spawn of ~Yeenoghu~, the Demon Lord of Gnolls, but haven't decided about what demon lords exist in Taelgar particularly %%

%%^Date:1748-03-01%%
He was summoned into the material plane, in the abandoned Dunmari stronghold of [[Raven's Hold]], in the spring of 1748, where he was charged by his summoner to spawn as many gnoll warbands as possible and release them into the Dunmari frontier. He was [[Session 11 (DuFr)|banished back to the Abyss]] by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] in April, 1748 DR.

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
Later, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] learned he had been summoned with the aid of the [[Ivory Scroll Cap Vision|demonic summoning scroll ]]provided by the hag [[Agata|Agata Dustmother]] as payment in exchange for the [[Scepter of Command]]. This was part of a complicated plan by the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] to sneak into [[Tokra]] with a flood of refugees, and complete a ritual to summon the madness of [[Jinnik]] into the material plane using the [[Extraplanar Weak Point]] north of [[Tokra]], connected to [[Pandemonium]], as a focal point.
