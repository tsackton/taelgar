####  **Roleplaying Notes**

- **Eccentric and Grandiose**: Zibzig constantly refers to himself in the third person and exaggerates his achievements. "Behold! The brilliance of Zibzig, Master of Light and Shadow!"
- **Skittish but Curious**: He’s wary of outsiders but cannot resist showing off his magical creations or asking invasive questions about the surface world.
- **Inventive and Resourceful**: Always fiddling with small contraptions or sketching runes in the dirt. He mutters to himself about “theoretical combustive resonance” and other arcane nonsense.
- **Emotionally Complex**: He’s proud of his independence but sometimes lonely, leading to mixed reactions to visitors—both suspicion and excitement.
- **Speech Quirks**: Talks rapidly, often mixing Draconic words with Common. Throws in sound effects ("POOF!") to emphasize his points.
#### **Desires and Goals**

**Annoyed because cave fisher just moved in, and is preventing him from using the river**

- **Recognition**: Zibzig wants to prove he’s more than a raiding kobold—he dreams of being remembered as a great wizard or alchemist in some grand tome.
- **Self-Sufficiency**: He left his clan to escape the endless cycle of raiding, but he’s determined to show he can thrive on his own.
- **Creation of a "Perfect Spell"**: Zibzig is obsessed with inventing a signature spell that will make him famous. He might ask for input or test early (chaotic) prototypes on visitors.
