![[image-grash-1.png|right|320]]Known as Grash the Undying, an undead warrior and commander of a large [[Orcs|orc]] army in Kharsan. He possessed the [[Ring of Undying]], and used it to create a large army of orcs and undead. 

Grash was rumored to once have been a knight from an unknown land, a warrior, skilled in battle, who sought glory in the [[Nashtkar]], and never returned. He became something of a rumor and legend, a haunted ghost to frighten children with. A knight of shadows who could cut wounds that would not heal with his glaive. A cursed warrior, who could summon chains of darkness to bind your heart and drag you closer to death. 

How he acquired the [[Ring of Undying]], and how he found himself in [[Apollyon|Apollyon]]'s service, are not known.
