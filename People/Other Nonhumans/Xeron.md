Xeron is an ancient aboleth entombed within the rock beneath the Yuvanti Mountains, near Tharn Todor. The being is believed to have mineralized, and is now more stone than flesh. Reports from explorers indicate it shows no evident interest in meddling with affairs beyond its cavern.

%% DM

An ancient aboleth, now more stone than anything else, that no longer cares to meddle in the world. Trapped in rock that was once under the sea beneath the Yuvanti mountains.
 
Introduced in: [[Ep 1 Chuul]]: 

- The vibe was that when the Yuvanti was uplifted, some things that were in the ocean got trapped. 
- Vibe: a crystallized aboleth that no longer cares to meddle in the world. 
- Mining under Tharn Todor uncovered ancient runes and a lost temple to an aboleth god; “Ancient aboleth now nearly a statue … still exists beneath Tharn Todor.”
- Relics mentioned in notes: a golden idol of Xeron; very old coins from Hkar found with it (Agnor’s possession in DM notes).
