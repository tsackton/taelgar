![[tharandros.png|right|500]]A centaur, the leader of a wandering herd. Wise and knowledgable.

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
The Dunmar Fellowship met this herd traveling across the [[Samtal]], the northern plains of [[Dunmar]], and convinced them to aid [[Karawa]], which proved crucial in driving off gnoll attacks. 

Tharandros stayed in Karawa for a time, but left to travel north with his herd in June, 1748.
