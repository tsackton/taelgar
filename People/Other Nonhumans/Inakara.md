%% One Note

Leader of the derro output that was in the dwarven side of Raven's Hold.
 
A short, dwarf height creature, with bruised skin and bedraggled white hair, currently living in the dwarven outpost at Raven’s Hold with about 30 other creatures like her.

The leader of the thralls, Inakara is completely mad, believing that she has been sent here by mind flayers to take control of this outpost and hold it for an invasion to come. But she will not reveal this (take a bit of a page from gollum, she will talk to herself and say things like "sssshh, we mustn't say, ssshh they cannot know"). She does not speak fluent Dwarven, and tends to drop articles and click her teeth or hiss or make other verbal tics while she speaks. She also pauses to lick her hands, or the air, or taste objects, quite frequently cutting herself off mid sentence.
 
She does not know about the secret door and is not that smart so will potentially think they appear out of nowhere. Won't immediately attack but will be nervous and touchy, if the party does not immediately placate her.
 
She will eventually get across that she'll let the party leave if they kill the beast in the cavern. If they try to head for vault, she'll threaten to attack unless they agree to give her some treasure.
 
**Age: unknown**  
**Last location (June 1748): killed by dwarven mission**
