![[motua.png|right|400]]One of the guardians of the [[Land of the Dead]], a [[Gidari]], who is native to the [[Land of the Dead]] and serves as a guide and protector of souls on their journey beyond the veil. 

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
In DR 1747, Motua fought [[Grash]] in the [[Land of the Dead]], and was wounded, and driven to the material plane. They arrived at the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], in pain, wracked by spiritual chains created by the [[Ring of Undying]], and unconsciously draining the spiritual essence of [[Azta Lekua]], the Footprint of the Gods. Motua was healed by [[Kenzo]] and his [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] allies in DR 1748.

- (DR:: 1747-06-11) [[Grash]] enters the [[Land of the Dead]] to activate the [[Ring of Undying]], and encounters [[People/Other Nonhumans/Motua]]. They fight, and [[People/Other Nonhumans/Motua]] is wounded.
- (DR:: 1747-07-02) [[People/Other Nonhumans/Motua]] lands, disoriented, in the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]].
- (DR:: 1748-11-06) [[Kenzo]], [[Izzarak]], and [[Enari]] heal [[People/Other Nonhumans/Motua]].
