Arvanko is a reclusive, prickly, and slow-to-trust Stoneborn ranger who lives alone on a hilltop east of [[Roscombe]], near the eaves of the [[Torvaine Forest]], about a day’s walk from town. Now in his later years, he has turned from hunting threats to carving a monument to the fallen: the unfinished, but massive, sculpture forms a a low circular wall nearly 200 feet in diameter, inscribed with the names of Rangers who died protecting Addermarch over the centuries. 

%% backstory 
Born not long after the Avatus wars, Arvanko grew up in a small Stoneborn village in the high mountains, only to see it destroyed during later conflicts. He wandered for years before joining the rangers along the western marches, serving primarily around Westcliff and the Highmoor. Decades of service left him worn and wary; roughly fifty years ago he withdrew from active duty to focus on “creating, not destroying,” slowly reclaiming his old stone‑carving craft and planning the memorial he now works to complete.

Though prickly and slow to trust, Arvanko knows the history of the frontier. He remembers that  the rangers once kept a detailed ledger recording cursed blades and their fates. He believes local copies of that ledger are lost, though he suspects others may survive in [[Adderfell]] or [[Sembara]] or elsewhere.
