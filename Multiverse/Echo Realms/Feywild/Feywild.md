### The Feywild

The echo realm of the fey, home to the realms of the Archfey and many other creatures. 

The people of the Feywild are generally referred to as fae or faerie as a whole, but within that category there are distinctions both obvious and subtle. 

-   The most common fae are the humanoid, generally human looking people just know as “fae”. The [[Fae]] are usually elegant and grace humanoids, generally human-like or elf-like in appearance, who could pass for humans in the right circumstances, although usually their eyes and demeanor give them away. 
    
-   The sometimes mischievous, sometimes helpful, and always magical flying fairies are also found in the feywild. These fey are usually small, and include creatures like the pixies, sprites, brownies, and other fairies.

-   The original archfey, at the dawn of the multiverse, were responsible for the awakening of many animals. Some of these now inhabit the Feywild as beastfolk of various kinds. Most famous and most common are the horned satyrs; rarer are the harengons (rabbit-folk) and owlins (owl-folk), and perhaps other creatures. While many of these fey have a fixed animal form, others are more like humans with animal features. 
    
-   [[Centaurs]], are more likely to be found in the material world of Taelgar, however some are found in the Feywild for various reasons.

%% Notes on centaurs: They were created by the archfey in the early days of the multiverse, just as satyrs and others. However, when the feywild was separately from the material plane, the centaurs stayed, becoming tied to the world of Taelgar itself, seeing themselves as the guardians of Taelgar. In the current day, most centaurs remain in the material plane, traveling and protecting the land of Taelgar itself. However, they are fey creatures, and some do find their way back to the feywild, for various reasons.  %%
    
-   Throughout the feywild, there are also innumerable dryads, nymphs, and other spirits of the land. These fey are typically strongly tied to a particular place, rarely traveling. 

The politics and political organization of the Feywild is based around the realms of the Archfey, such as [[Shimmersong]], [[Amberglow]], [[Fortune's Rest]] or other lesser known realms.

%% Notes on how the feywild works: 
. Some basic facts of the layout and workings of the plane are detailed here:

-   The layout and terrain of the Feywild very loosely matches the layout and terrain of the material plane of Taelgar; so where there are big mountain chains in Taelgar, there are usually mountains of some kind in the Feywild. But this matching is very loose, and often based more on vibes or history than physical geography.
    
-   Distances are very different in the Feywild than in Taelgar. Two portals to the Feywild could be 1000 miles apart in Taelgar and only 100 miles apart in the Feywild, or vice versa. 
    
-   Time works strangely in the Feywild. First, there is no night or day; the sun does not move in the sky. However, as you go further west it gets more and more "morning" and as you go further east it gets more and more "evening". So for example, there is a point in the far east where it is constant midnight, and a point in the west where it is always dawn. Second, the Feywild itself is somewhat timeless -- it is hard to track the passage of days without the sun moving, for example. When you travel between the Feywild and another plane, it is never clear how much time will have passed. The same thing is true for journeys in the Feywild itself - moving from one location to another might take a week, but then going back might take only a day.
    
-   The feywild runs on emotion: flowers might wilt if an argument is happening, or bloom if people are laughing nearby 
  

The fey themselves also follow specific rules and customs.

-   The feywild runs on bargains and gifts. The fey don't really use currency, and the place is magical enough that food, water, and shelter are simple to obtain, albeit often with a cost as unknowingly eating the bounty of a fey lord's domain can also bind you to their service. Generally speaking, going back on a deal is a huge crime in all domains across the feywild, and can get you cursed in nasty ways. In some places, the culture is to try to weasel out of things or take as much as you can by being as literal as possible (e.g., if you say "Can I have your name?" implying you just want to know what it is, and someone says "Sure, it's So-and-so", you. might literally take their name away from them). In other places, the culture is much more friendly and less mischievous / tricksy. However, this is balanced by reciprocity and hospitality - taking something from someone, or accepting a gift, binds you to them and you must then give them something of approximately equal value in return to maintain the balance.
    
-   Many fey also cannot or will not tell an outright lie, although they will happily lie by omission or implication. Generally speaking, this is the fey of medieval folklore, of the original fairy tales, not so much the Disney-esque modern versions. 

-   Pretty much all of the feywild is part of realms of various Archfey and Fey Lords. Each fey lords domain can be fairly different - some have glittering courts, even cities, while others are extremely wild, and many are in between; some are largely pleasant and friendly, others hostile or malicious. Some are pretty strict about policing their boundaries, others let anyone pass, still others are hidden and cannot be found by ordinary means. The transitions are often not obvious to non-fey (but all fey can easily sense these borders) and catching someone trespassing is an easy way the fey lords use to lure the unknowing or unwitting into deals and bargains.
    
-   The archfey and fey lords that rule the domains of the feywild generally owe their allegiance to either the Seelie Court or the Unseelie Court. While crudely considered "good" and "evil" fey by unknowing humans, the real differences between them are subtler and more complicated, with the Seelie Court generally associated with protocol and the trappings of civilization, and the Unseelie Court generally associated with indulgence of primal instincts and a much more chaotic vibe. There are also independent archfey that shun the conflict of the Seelie and Unseelie courts and hold themselves neutral.
