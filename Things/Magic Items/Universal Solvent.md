# Universal Solvent

Universal Solvent is a rare alchemical liquid capable of dissolving even stubborn magical bindings. It is typically stored in small crystal vials and used sparingly.

A vial containing four doses was recovered from the [[Elemental Forge]] and used to destroy the silver threads binding a trapped elemental. The last known dose was later used in the fighting near [[Uzgukhar]] to dissolve the otherworldly bonds wrapped around the [[Ring of Undying]], allowing the ring to be destroyed.
