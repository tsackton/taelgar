Universal Solvent is an exceptionally rare alchemical liquid capable of dissolving anything, even planar connections and powerful magical artifacts. It is typically stored in small crystal vials and used sparingly.

The last known dose was later used in the fighting near [[Uzgukhar]] to dissolve the otherworldly bonds wrapped around the [[Ring of Undying]], allowing the ring to be destroyed.
