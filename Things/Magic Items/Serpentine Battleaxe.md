The Serpentine Battleaxe is a heavy, magically sharp battleaxe set with sinuous green serpent‑stone along the haft and head, forged in the era of the [[Dominion of Avatus]]. It bears significant similarity to the [[Serpentine Dagger]]; both weapons are tied to Avatus‑era wars, were likely wielded by trusted commanders of [[Avatus]]' armies, and bear enchantments that twist their wielders toward obsession, isolation, and escalating violence.
