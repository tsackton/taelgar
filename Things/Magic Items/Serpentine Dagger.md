%%^Campaign:none%%

Full timeline:

- (DR::1715-03-09): A Torvaine Watch scout returned from a forage with the jeweled dagger and slew his companion Piri, the curse’s first known victim (People/Addermarians/Piri.md:25).
- (DR::1715-03-23) The soldier—still unnamed in official records—confessed to steward Wulfram that he had stolen the blade from an unblessed Avatus tomb and had become obsessed with checking on it daily, so he left it in Wulfram’s care ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 1 - Torvaine Watch/Session 2 - DM Notes.md:34; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 1 - Torvaine Watch/Session 2 - DM Notes.md:38).
- (DR::1715-03-28) Wulfram suffered a nightmare of divine abandonment, recognized the dagger as evil, and resolved to melt it down or send it to a distant temple once the rains cleared, planning to involve Commander Arpaad personally ( _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 1 - Torvaine Watch/Session 2 - DM Notes.md:44).
- (DR::1715-03-29) Wulfram disappeared (later recorded as dead) while Bartoz’s letter noted the hilt’s snake-like gems, his failed attempt to incinerate the relic, and his suspicion that Arpaad lied about sending Wulfram away, prompting him to alert Marshal Brask (People/Addermarians/Wulfram.md:9; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 1 - Torvaine Watch/Session 2 - DM Notes.md:75; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 1 - Torvaine Watch/Session 2 - DM Notes.md:79; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 1 - Torvaine Watch/Session 2 - DM Notes.md:81).
- (DR::1715-04-01) The Serpentine Dagger fully subverted Sir Einrik Arpaad; he murdered Marshal Hildo Brask and the entire garrison before Bartoz mortally wounded him, dying in the effort and leaving Einrik’s soul bound as a ghost (People/Addermarians/Einrik Arpaad.md:38; People/Addermarians/Hildo Brask.md:33; People/Addermarians/Bartoz.md:38).
- (DR::1715-04-28) The Addermarch Mercenaries fought through Torvaine Watch’s undead, destroyed Bartoz’s revenant, grabbed the dagger from Einrik’s quarters while his ghost hurled debris, and confirmed its mind-warping power when a familiar touched it and turned on its master (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 02.md:25; Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 02.md:63; Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 02.md:65).
- (DR::1715-04-30 to 05-01) On the road they secured Sir Gareth Howell’s cooperation to keep the relic hidden, then briefed Lady Elowen Duval in Roscombe; she ordered them to consult Owen Tavish and relayed the rider’s full account of the dagger’s discovery, containment attempts, and massacre (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 02.md:29; Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 02.md:31; Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 02.md:82; People/Addermarians/Elowen Duval.md:24).
- (DR::1715-05-02) Owen Tavish’s letter reached them while he rode with Sir Gareth to cleanse Einrik’s ghost, warning them to keep the dagger secret or lock it with Isolde until he returned (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 03.md:25; _dm_notes/_Addermarch/Adventure 2 - Cockatrice/Adventure 2 - Caves of the Cockatrice.md:20).
- (DR::1715-05-05) - (DR_end::1715-05-06) After finishing the rite at Torvaine, Owen met the party, confirmed they needed extraordinary heat to unmake the blade, and pointed them to the alchemical fire Trueflame; they immediately traveled to Caradoc’s workshop, paid a deposit, and commissioned the brew (People/Addermarians/Owen Tavish.md:26; Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 04.md:26; Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 04.md:28; People/Addermarians/Caradoc.md:30).
- (DR::1715-05-08) Clearing the goblin lair yielded the glowing-poison recipe Caradoc demanded; that evening they stopped in Brantor, paid the balance, and received the completed vial of Trueflame (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 05.md:26; Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 05.md:27; People/Addermarians/Caradoc.md:31).
- (DR::1715-05-09) In the Temple of the Sibyl, Isolde secured the sanctum while Owen oversaw the application of Trueflame that finally unmade the Serpentine Dagger, ending the threat that began with the Torvaine tomb (Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 05.md:28; Campaigns/Addermarch Campaign/Addermarch - Session 05.md:57; People/Addermarians/Owen Tavish.md:27; People/Addermarians/Isolde of Roscombe.md:31).
