The Serpentine Dagger was a cursed jeweled dagger associated with [[Avatus]]. Those who handled it fell under a paranoid compulsion to keep the blade close, eventually descending to violent madness, and the curse drove multiple murders at [[Torvaine Watch]] in DR 1715.

Recovered by the [[Addermarch Mercenaries]] after the fall of the watch, the dagger was ultimately unmade in the Temple of the Sibyl in [[Roscombe]] using the alchemical fire [[Trueflame]], under the supervision of [[Owen Tavish]].
