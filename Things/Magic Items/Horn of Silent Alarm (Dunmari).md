A common magic item created in large numbers by the Dunmari during the [[Dharajun Dynasty]], especially in the years before and during the [[Great War]]. Typically carried by Dunmari scouts and outriders, and used to alert trailing forces of danger. These items are often associated with the blessings of [[Chidya]]. Although a variety of designs are common, all feature a horse motif.

%%Campaign:DuFr%%
The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] has found two of these horns.

One, carried by [[Delwath]], [[Session 45 (DuFr)|was taken]] from [[Justan]], a perhaps-reformed Dunmari bandit, after he and his companions were cruelly murdered by [[Casian|dastardly]] [[Kadmos|Chardonians]].

A second, once carried by [[Kenzo]], [[Session 3 (DuFr)|was found]] in the ruined Dunmari [[Dunmari Fort (Gomat)|fort]] east of the [[Gomat]] oasis, on the body of Dunmari scout who apparently died more than a hundred years ago. This horn has an etched running horse design. It was [[Session 69 (DuFr)|sacrificed]] as part of the ritual to free [[Kenzo]] from the cursed soul chain that [[Session 57 (DuFr)|he acquired]] while freeing [[Motua]].
