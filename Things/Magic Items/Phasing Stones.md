# Phasing Stones

Phasing stones are ancient fragments of magical energy that power the reality-twisting constructions of the giants. Each phasing stone is a unique construction, that embeds something of another plane into its very fabric, and allows the attuned user, with enough skill and practice, to manipulate that planar energy in a potent way.
