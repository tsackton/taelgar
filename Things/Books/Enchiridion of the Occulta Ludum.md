# The Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum

The Enchiridion of the Occulta Ludum appears to be a blank handbook of the [[Occulta Ludum]], a Drankorian secret society. These books radiate faint illusion magic, and were clearly produced using magical means. 

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] has recovered two of these books in their travels. One, they found in among the surviving books and papers in [[Stormcaller Tower]], presumably once owned by [[Eudomes]]. 

The second, they found at the [[Elemental Forge]], probably once owned by the unnamed [[Occulta Ludum]] mage who staffed that place in the days of the Drankorian Empire.
