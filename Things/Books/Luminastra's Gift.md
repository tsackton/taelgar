# Luminastra's Gift

A popular comedic play written by [[Thomas Hawke]], a playwright in [[Tollen]]. The play tells the story of Geoffrey, a down-on-his-luck sailor shipwrecked by carelessness in a storm on the Green Sea, as Luminastra, a whale endowed with magic, who rescues him and takes him to a magical world beneath the ocean. Over the course of the play, Geoffrey encounters various strange wonders far beneath the ocean, and comes to earn a second chance. By the end, he is returned to the surface world a changed man. 

The inspiration for this play, according to [[Thomas Hawke]], was in part the rumors and songs from [[Apporia]] of a garden of magical jade beneath the oceans, tended by [[Merfolk]] who could grow names.
