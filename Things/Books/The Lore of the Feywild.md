# The Lore of the Feywild
>[!info]+ Information  
> (book)  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

A book of collected [[Feywild]] lore written by [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]]. 

This extensive tome contains a large diversity of stories and tales, many contradicting each other, collected from many sources around the west coast and the [[Chardonian Empire]]. It is a rambling opus, full of digressions. 

While it contains several maps of the Feywild and its relationship to the material world of Taelgar, these also tend to contradict each other, and the truth is hard to discern. However, four portals are consistently reported and claimed by eyewitness accounts to lead to the Feywild:
- [[Lastlight Falls]], a portal to [[Amberglow]] in what is now the [[Nashtkar]], northwest of [[Kharsan]] and south of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] in the material plane
- [[Deepforest Stones]], a portal between the [[Elderwood]] and [[Dreamhaven]], located near the source of the [[Kayan]]
- [[Tangled Vale]], a portal between the [[Tawir Forest]] and [[Wildrun]], located in the center of the forest. 
- [[Golden Door]], a portal to [[Fortune's Rest]], located near where the Chardon Road crosses the northern tributary of the [[Yeraad]].
