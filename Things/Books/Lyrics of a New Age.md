# Lyrics of a New Age

This is a collection of poems and songs by a relatively little-known Drankorian era Elvish poet. Notable in Elvish literary history in that Nelawe was an early example of Elvish works departing from the tradition poetic and epic forms, playing with spacing and language in echo and response to the classics. Of particular note  is her fascination with responding to and playing with themes of the forgotten past, which for elves often meant giants and the lore of the timeless days of during the Age of Creation. 

Found in [[Stormcaller Tower]], later sold in Darba to [[Albus]]. The book is clearly well-read, and a few poems mentioning storm giants and their connection to dreams and prophecy seem to be particularly starred. 

Stanza that Eudomes used as the key to unlock the chains:

A Lament for Lost Thunder

Gone are the days of giants striding, thunder in hand, earth    (shaking
their roars through the ages, their fury, a memory) unchanging--
dreams of ancient lore, the skies ablaze with storms, their 
gaze
upon the distant cloud on which they soar, a force unbowed
