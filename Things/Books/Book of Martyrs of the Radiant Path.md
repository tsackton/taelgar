The Book of Martyrs of the Radiant Path is a hidden memorial record that was kept by the priests of the [[Radiant Path]] in [[Drankor]]. It records those who vanished or were taken during [[Apollyon]]’s reign, preserving their names and brief life stories for the faithful. One copy was recovered from the [[Temple of the Eight Divines]] in [[Drankor]] by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] in DR 1749; whether other copies exist is not known.

In DR 1749, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] recovered a copy of book from the administrative complex of the [[Temple of the Eight Divines]] while seeking the souls bound in [[Apollyon's Phylactery]]. The surviving pages included accounts of [[Antonius Patrius]], [[Floria of Aphasium]], [[Marius of Drankor]], and [[Valanthe]], four of the seven souls bound to [[Apollyon's Phylactery]].

%% DM Note
The Sembaran church is supposed to have been fairly radical and oriented as a resistance to Apollyon; it is plausible, and perhaps likely, that more copies of the Book of Martyrs, and probably other records of the Radiant Path, survive in Embry at least, and possibly elsewhere.
