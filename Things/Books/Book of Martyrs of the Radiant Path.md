# Book of Martyrs of the Radiant Path

The Book of Martyrs of the Radiant Path is a hidden memorial kept by the priests of the [[Radiant Path]] in [[Drankor]]. It records those who vanished or were taken during [[Apollyon]]’s reign, preserving their names and brief life stories for the faithful.

In DR 1749, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] recovered the book from the administrative complex of the [[Temple of the Eight Divines]] while seeking the souls bound in [[Apollyon's Phylactery]]. The surviving pages include accounts of [[Antonius Patrius]], [[Floria of Aphasium]], [[Marius of Drankor]], and [[Valanthe]].
