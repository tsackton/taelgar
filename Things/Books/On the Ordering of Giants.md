# On the Ordering of Giants
>[!info]+ Information  
> (book)  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

An ancient scholarly treatise on [[giants]], written in a strange language presumed to be the first tongue of humans. Only one copy is known to exist: it was preserved in the library of [[Eudomes]] at [[Stormcaller Tower]], recovered by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], and now is kept in the moving library on [[Vindristjarna]]. 

The book describes the magical and metaphysical underpinning thought, by human scholars at least, to result in the well known differences among different types of giants.
