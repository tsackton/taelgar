# Tales Before the Fall

Tales Before the Fall is a large book, standing 4 feet tall, written in Giant, that preserves ancient myths and legends telling of the origin of giants and their deeds in age days. Only one original copy, now kept in the library on [[Vindristjarna]], is known to survive outside of giant strongholds, though others may yet be discovered; the myths and legends, however, are recorded elsewhere in translation.  

The extant copy was originally discovered by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] in the library of [[Eudomes]] at [[Stormcaller Tower]], alongside other rare and ancient works on giants.
