![[dreamweaver-staff.jpg|right|300]]The Dreamweaver Staff is a carved wooden staff with an intricate pattern of swirling shapes. It has been carried by the Speaker of the [[Shakun Mystai]] for many generations, and is said to be able to allow the bearer to manipulate dreams. It is even possible, supposedly, to transport subjects into the [[Dreamworld]] with this staff. 

%%Campaign:DuFr%%
Currently, this staff is carried by [[Candrosa]], and was used by Candrosa after the return of the [[Heart of Shakun]] to send the members of the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] on journeys to the [[Dreamworld]]
