### The Scepter of Command

This scepter is about a foot long and is constructed in silver, with five loops of silver forming a ball at the head, set with diamonds that seem to catch the light. It feels very old, and yet doesn't seem tarnished or worn at all. 

Seen in [[Eudomes' Mirror]]: [[Scepter of Command Vision]]

From the mirror, you learned this is of Drankorian origin, constructed by [[Emperor Apollyon]], an emperor of [[Drankor]] in a tall black tower on a perfectly circular island, and used to enhance his command of his armies. It was carried by the fire giant who destroyed [[Kharsan]], you presume [[Mavdyr]] who led an [[Orcs|orc]] horde to attack [[Tokra]] in 1552 by the Drankorian Reckoning, 7 years after the death of [[Cha'mutte]]. [[Agata]] apparently obtained it in trade with the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]], in exchange for a scroll that would summon (and presumably bind) a demon from the [[Abyss]] who had the power to create gnoll armies, as well as a [[Pandemonium Scroll|scroll]] with the power to enhance the essence of [[Pandemonium]]. 

From the little you have learned, it seems it wants to be used.

#### Properties

You have identified the following properties of this item so far, although its full powers seem much more vast than these:

-   Intimidating Presence. While attuned to this scepter, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. 
-   Aura of Command. While attuned to the scepter, you can, as an action, expend one charge to summon an aura of command. This aura lasts for 1 minute, and while it lasts you can issue a command, as if casting the command spell at 1st level, as a bonus action, with a DC of 15. This command is spoken in all languages simultaneously.

## Destruction

The Scepter of Command was destroyed in 1748, by [[The Dunmar Fellowship]]. It was immersed in the sacred waters on the island of [[Gazetteer/The Green Sea Region/Western Green Sea/Skaerhem/Vetta|Vetta]] in the Skaer Islands for 24 hours during a full moon, and then shattered with the combined power of [[Kenzo]]'s staff and the might of [[Kaikkea]]'s waters.
