One of the relics of Apollyon. Now possessed by Fausto, and used to enslave and mind control troublemakers. 

The Crown of Purity is an ancient relic whose form shifts to match its bearer. In the days of the [[Drankorian Empire]], it was part of Apollyon’s imperial regalia and a focus for his dominion over the people of [[Drankor]]. After his fall it passed out of sight, resurfacing centuries later in [[Chardon]].

In modern times the cult known as [[The Cleansed]] used the crown to enthrall and command those they deemed impure, including forcing several Chardonian allies to serve [[Fausto]]. When claimed by [[Riswynn]] in DR 1749, its magic quieted and its appearance changed again, reflecting a new bearer and purpose.

The mask is sitting on a table, next to a black crown, seemingly made of some kind of matte black iron with dark gems, black pearls or opal of some kind, set in the points. A faint dark smoke seems to be seeping from the crown.
