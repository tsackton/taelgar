# The Crown of Purity

One of the relics of Apollyon. Now possessed by Fausto, and used to enslave and mind control troublemakers. 

The Crown of Purity is an ancient relic whose form shifts to match its bearer. In the days of the [[Drankorian Empire]], it was part of Apollyon’s imperial regalia and a focus for his dominion over the people of [[Drankor]]. After his fall it passed out of sight, resurfacing centuries later in [[Chardon]].

In modern times the cult known as [[The Cleansed]] used the crown to enthrall and command those they deemed impure, including forcing several Chardonian allies to serve [[Fausto]]. When claimed by [[Riswynn]] in DR 1749, its magic quieted and its appearance changed again, reflecting a new bearer and purpose.

## DM notes

### At-a-glance

- **Current campaign state (DuFr, DR 1749):** Although this note’s lead text says “Now possessed by Fausto”, campaign notes indicate the crown was taken from Fausto and subsequently worn by [[Riswynn]] (see [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 117 (DuFr)|Session 117]], [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 124 (DuFr)|Session 124]], and [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Party Treasure|Party Treasure]]).
- **Primary antagonist tie-in:** The crown is consistently treated as one of Apollyon’s key relics and a major tool used by [[The Cleansed]] to enthrall targets (see [[People/Chardonians/Fausto]], [[Groups/The Cleansed]], and `_DM_/_Dunmari Frontier/Dunmari Frontier OneNote/Campaign Notes/The Relics of Apollyon.md`).

### Origin and timeline (with inconsistencies)

This vault contains multiple overlapping origin stories:

- **Riving-era relic:** The [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Mirror Visions/Crown of Purity Vision|Mirror of the Past vision]] presents the crown as a fragment of primordial power formed during the Riving (“something was caught when the world was pulled apart … curled itself into a circlet”), pre-dating humanity.
- **Downfall War use on Hkar:** The same vision shows the crown used by priests of the Eight Divines to animate/raise a walking island as Hkar faced invasion; this matches a note in [[Gods and Religions/Religions/Mos Numena/Mos Numena]] describing the crown being used during the Downfall War to create/animate/summon a massive walking island refuge for Hkar’s population.
- **Apollyon-built artifact:** This note’s existing `%%SECRET[2]%% Open question for review: decide whether Apollyon *created* the crown outright, or *recovered/repurposed* a much older Riving-era circlet into the Crown of Purity as imperial regalia. Current notes support both framings. %%

### Known manifestations and “forms”

The crown is repeatedly described as a chameleon-like relic that changes shape to match bearer/context:

- **Unformed / inert forms:** The vision shows it as a plain circlet/band in multiple materials (steel, iron, wood) at different times (see [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Mirror Visions/Crown of Purity Vision|Crown of Purity Vision]]).
- **Apollyon’s regalia:** The vision shows an elaborate black-metal imperial design with “thousands upon thousands of tendrils of magic” reaching into a controlled populace (see [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Mirror Visions/Crown of Purity Vision|Crown of Purity Vision]]). The manacles vision also shows Apollyon wearing the crown alongside the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] while forging the phylactery and infusing the lich-potion (see [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Mirror Visions/Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles Vision|Apollyon’s Soulbinding Manacles Vision]]).
- **Cleansed-era form:** The vision includes the crown shifting toward a black-metal design with dark stones as an older robed mage takes it up (explicitly “this is not Fausto”) (see [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Mirror Visions/Crown of Purity Vision|Crown of Purity Vision]]).
- **Fausto-era table description (in this note):** matte black iron with dark gems; faint dark smoke seeping.
- **Riswynn-era form:** The vision shows the crown as silver with ruby insets, seven points, dwarven runes and hammer motifs, once it is removed from the Portable Hole and shown to the mirror (see [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Mirror Visions/Crown of Purity Vision|Crown of Purity Vision]]).

%% Potential continuity note: the vision depicts the crown “shattering” when thrown during Apollyon’s fall; later scenes still show it as an intact wearable crown. Treat “shattering” as symbolic/vision logic unless/until clarified. %%

### What the crown does (as currently written across notes)

The crown is consistently tied to coercion/identity-magic, plus additional “amplifier” effects:

- **Mass dominion / enthrallment:** The crown is presented as the focus by which Apollyon controlled thousands in Drankor (vision), and in modern times as the tool used by [[The Cleansed]] to enthrall “impure” targets (this note; [[Groups/The Cleansed]]).
- **Cleansed initiation / “purification”:** `_DM_/_Dunmari Frontier/Dunmari Frontier OneNote/Campaign Notes/The Relics of Apollyon.md` frames the crown as a centerpiece of Cleansed initiation rituals; this is consistent with this note’s `%%SECRET[3]%%SECRET` chronology; campaign summary notes say she was mind controlled using the crown (see [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Dunmar Fellowship Associates]]).
- [[People/Chardonians/Amelia]]: controlled by Fausto using the crown; left mentally adrift when control was broken.
- Chardonian officials/oligarch-adjacent bureaucrats: campaign notes describe multiple “mind-broken” bureaucrats formerly controlled by Fausto, and a list of affected citizens obtained when Kenzo briefly controlled the crown (see [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 126 (DuFr)|Session 126]]).

### Related relics and “suite” context

Multiple DM and campaign notes treat the crown as one of several linked Apollyon relics:

- `_DM_/_Dunmari Frontier/Dunmari Frontier OneNote/Campaign Notes/The Relics of Apollyon.md` lists “five relics” and positions the crown as the Cleansed/Chardon-linked one.
- The crown appears in mirror visions alongside the [[Cloak of Rainbows]] and in scenes involving the [[Scepter of Command]] (see [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Mirror Visions/Crown of Purity Vision|Crown of Purity Vision]] and [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Mirror Visions/Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles Vision|Manacles Vision]]).

### DM-only mechanical notes (from `_DM_` planning)

- `_DM_/_Dunmari Frontier/Session 111-117 (Drankor)/Fausto - DM Notes.md` suggests Fausto can “negate a spell as a reaction — it is absorbed into the crown.”
- That same DM note states: “Cleansed can be freed by destroying the Crown,” but flags uncertainty about whether Apollyon must also be destroyed / whether the crown’s destruction is constrained by Apollyon’s tomb foundations.
- `_DM_/_Dunmari Frontier/Session 83-97 (Ursk)/Session 95 - DM Notes.md` describes an intended plan: start a war and use the dead “via a magical link from the Crown of Purity” to charge Apollyon’s phylactery until he can break free.

### Campaign beats explicitly tied to the crown

- **Post-Apollyon fallout:** [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 117 (DuFr)|Session 117]] includes the party receiving news via Riswynn’s control of the crown about violence among chalyte workers in Chardon.
- **Chardon unrest loop:** [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 121 (DuFr)|Session 121]] describes Riswynn receiving troubling news through the crown about riots and a power vacuum in Chardon.
- **Release of enthralled captives:** [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 124 (DuFr)|Session 124]] notes releasing prisoners from the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] “now free of The Cleansed control,” with Riswynn’s reorientation of the crown’s magic implied in the associated campaign summaries.

### Cross-links to revisit later

- `_DM_/Timelines/Apollyon Endgame Timeline.md` and `_DM_/Timelines/Cloak of Rainbows Timeline.md` include additional DM chronology hooks involving the crown.
- `History/Background/Historical Framework.md` contains a note that the Riving (or its aftermath) created powerful artifacts “most notably the Crown of Purity and the Heartroot.”
