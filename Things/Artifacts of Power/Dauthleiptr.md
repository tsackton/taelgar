Dauðleiptr, literally "Death Lightning" in the Giant tongue, is a chalyte-powered death ray constructed by the stone giant [[Dhrukmir]] to protect his territory in the [[Chataan Mountains]]. Capable of vaporizing dozens and dozens of soldiers, and with a scrying-based ability to target enemies at some large distance away, Dauðleiptr kept the chalyte mines of [[Ulgrathar]] in [[Dhrukmir]]'s hands for many years.

%%^Date:1749-07-05%%
In DR 1749, Dauðleiptr was destroyed by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], on a quest to discover new chalyte resources for [[Mitus Verina Auratan]].
