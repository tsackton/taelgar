%% note my "private notes" are piles of notecards and journals in a box so may not be relevant %%

A staff carried by [[Beryl]] during the Great War, now said to be part of the [[Fox and Hunter]]. It was said to have granted [[Beryl]] extraordinary perception and willpower.

%% From high school game, my main memories are it was a quarterstaff and the focus of Beryl's fox familiar. Leaving the status blank though until such a time as I want to dig up / retcon / reinvent stuff %%
