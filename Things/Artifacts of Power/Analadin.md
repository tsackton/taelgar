%% set status/cleanup/external but could decide this is too annoying and/or high school notes don't count, and remove but leave dm_notes: important and dm_owner: joint %%

A staff carried by [[Beryl]] during the Great War, now said to be part of the [[Fox and Hunter]]. It was said to have granted [[Beryl]] extraordinary perception and willpower.

%% Mike; From high school game, my main memories are it was a quarterstaff and the focus of Beryl's fox familiar. Leaving the status blank though until such a time as I want to dig up / retcon / reinvent stuff 

DM nots are largely piles of notecards and journals in a box so require significant effort to dig up.
