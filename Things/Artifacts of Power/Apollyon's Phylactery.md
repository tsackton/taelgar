Apollyon's Phylactery was the soul vessel of the lich [[Apollyon]]. It took the form of a simple, unmarked dagger forged of [[adamantine]], forged by the binding of seven innocent souls in a dark rite. Through it, Apollyon anchored his undeath and sustained his power.

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
The dagger was forged by Apollyon in his tower, using layered metal and [[adamantine]], and [[Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles Vision|fed by sacrifices]] restrained in [[Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles]]. 

Long hidden and protected by [[Rai]] within the ruins of the [[Temple of the Eight Divines]] in [[Drankor]], the phylactery was recovered in DR 1749 by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]]. The dagger was later carried into the [[Land of the Dead]], where mementos tied to each soul helped them remember who they were, and pass on. With their release, the phylactery unraveled and ceased to exist.

The seven souls bound within, named in Apollyon’s notes: [[Antonius Patrius]], [[Floria of Aphasium]], [[Marius of Drankor]], [[Valanthe]], [[Seraphina Appleblossom]], [[Khemut of Targu]], and [[Minarith]].
