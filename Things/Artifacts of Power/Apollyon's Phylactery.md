# Apollyon's Phylactery

Apollyon's Phylactery was the soul vessel of the lich [[Apollyon]]. It took the form of a plain dagger forged of [[Adamantine]], layered and inscribed with incantations to bind souls around Apollyon’s essence. Through it, Apollyon anchored his undeath and sustained his power.

Long hidden within the ruins of the [[Temple of the Eight Divines]] in [[Drankor]], the phylactery was recovered in DR 1749 by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]]. The dagger was later carried into the [[Land of the Dead]], where the souls bound within were freed; with their release, the phylactery unraveled and ceased to exist.

## DM notes

- The [[Dunmar Fellowship]]’s visions in the [[Mirror of the Past]] show Apollyon forging the dagger in his tower, using layered metal and an adamantine sheath. The phylactery was fed by sacrifices restrained in [[Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles]].
- The seven souls bound within, named in Apollyon’s notes: [[Antonius Patrius]], [[Floria of Aphasium]], [[Marius of Drankor]], [[Valanthe]], [[Seraphina Appleblossom]], [[Khemut of Targu]], and [[Minarith]].
- Destruction method (DR 1749-05-24): carry the dagger to the Land of the Dead and use mementos tied to each soul to help them remember and pass on, unraveling the cocoon around Apollyon’s essence.
