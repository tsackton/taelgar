# The Chalice of the Runepriest

A elaborate rune-carved chalice that was found when the [[Dwarves]] fleeing the destruction of the kingdom of [[Ardith]] at the end of the [[Events/1500s/Great War]] reached the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], in a chamber carved and prepared deep beneath the ground, reminiscent of [[The Heart of the Mountain]]. When it was first found, it flowed with salt water (some say, the tears of the [[Bahrazel]]; others a memory of the ocean that once covered the land), and marked where [[Tharn Todor]] was constructed. 

In DR 1575, it was taken north by a large rescue mission that went looking for survivors from Ardtih, as many [[Dwarves]] were lost at the beginning of the [[Blood Years]]. It was hoped the Chalice could be a beacon, a guide to survivors who could still be rescued. But tragically, the rescue mission itself was lost, and despite the pain of losing the Chalice, it was decided that no more dwarven lives could be risked in the ruins of Ardith. Until, in the past year, rumors of its recovery surfaced, and led to [[Chardon]].Â

## History of the Chalice
(as seen in images in the pool of [[The Heart of the Mountain]] by [[Riswynn]] and companions in [[Session 53-54 (DuFr)|Riswynn's adventure]])

The chalice started as a mark of safety, a place of refuge from war in the new kingdom of [[Nardith]]. It was taken north, later, by a group of soldiers, traveling to find refugees, gathering lists of names of those who were lost in the [[Events/1500s/Great War]], with the hope the chalice can help lead them to safety. 

In the north, these warriors found success, finding hundreds upon hundreds of refugees, hiding in the dark. On the way back, the long march across the plains, they are sustained by the chalice. 

Until a fire giant, [[Odim Mavdyrson]], attacked the refugees, screaming about vengeance for his father, trolls with him. 

The refugees flee with the chalice, to a massive Stoneborn statue on the plains. They build hasty fortifications, a grim warrior bearing a large two-handed axe and an iron helm leading the way. Carrying the chalice. 

Then flames flickering at the end of the fight. The grim warrior turning on his companions, dwarf fighting dwarf, the warrior screaming that death is all that is left. The chalice, lying forgotten. The smoke gradually growing thicker and thicker as the grim warrior, the refugees, the trolls, all flicker out one by one and vanish. The chalice left, abandoned.
