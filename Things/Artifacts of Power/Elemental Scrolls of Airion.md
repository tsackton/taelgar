# Elemental Scrolls of Airion

The Elemental Scrolls of Airion are four legendary scrolls of elemental power crafted by the wizard [[Airion Mistspeaker|Airion]] before the [[Great War]]. Lost amid the upheavals of the [[Blood Years]], they became the subject of a long search by the [[Great Library]].

The four scrolls are known as the [[Flamekeeper Scroll]], the [[Stonemaster Scroll]], the [[Skyborn Scroll]], and the [[Deepwater Scroll]]. In DR 1747, the adventurers later called the [[Silver Tempests]] recovered all four for Archivist [[Lyra]] of the Great Library, an exploit that first brought them renown.

## DM notes

- The Great Library’s commission to the Silver Tempests began with known locations for the Flamekeeper and Stonemaster scrolls, while the Skyborn and Deepwater scrolls were missing.
- The recovery of the full set formed the core of the Silver Tempests’ first major adventure.
