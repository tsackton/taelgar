The Elemental Scrolls of Airion are four legendary scrolls of elemental power crafted by the wizard [[Airion |Airion Mistspeaker]] before the [[Great War]], but lost amid the upheavals of the [[Blood Years]]. The four scrolls are known as the [[Flamekeeper Scroll]], the [[Stonemaster Scroll]], the [[Skyborn Scroll]], and the [[Deepwater Scroll]]. 

%%^Date:1747%%
In DR 1747, they became the subject of a long search by the [[Great Library]]. A group of treasure seekers, who would later become known as the [[Silver Tempests]], were hired by [[Lyra|Archivist Lyra]] of the [[Great Library]] to recover these scrolls, from various locations associated with [[Airion]] in [[Greater Voltara]] and environs. They succeeded, and all four scrolls were returned to [[Chardon]] in the summer of DR 1747.
