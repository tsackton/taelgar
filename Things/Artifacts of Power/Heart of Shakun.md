A rough hewn ochre stone heart, a focus for [[Shakun]]'s power in the mortal realm. 

Allows the maintenance of the web of illusions that protects [[Dunmar]]'s eastern border from enemies. 

Must remain in the [[Red Mesa]], the physical embodiment of [[Shakun]] in this world, in order to function as the heartbeat of the [[Shakun Mystai]] and allow Dunmari's protections to be maintained.
