# The Ring of Undying

A ring, worn by [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]], that supposedly lets one cheat death forever, and control death around you. 

Presumably the source of [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]]'s ability to resurrect dead [[Orcs]] into undead. 

Also theorized to be a relic of [[Apollyon]].
