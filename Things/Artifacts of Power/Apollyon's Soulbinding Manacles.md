# Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles

These ancient enchanted manacles were kept in [[Apollyon]]’s tower on the [[~Circular Island~]]. They were fashioned to hold victims in place during the rites that created [[Apollyon's Phylactery]], drawing their souls and life into the dagger.

In DR 1749, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] examined the manacles through the [[Mirror of the Past]], witnessing echoes of the sacrifices that fed Apollyon’s transformation into a lich.

## DM notes

- Mirror vision shows a bound victim repeatedly slashing their wrists while chained in the manacles; sparks of soul‑energy flowed from the manacles into the forming phylactery.
- The spilled blood pooled into a central well and was later infused with power from the [[Crown of Purity]] to brew Apollyon’s lich‑potion.
