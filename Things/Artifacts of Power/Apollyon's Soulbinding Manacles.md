# Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles

These ancient enchanted manacles were chained to the wall in [[Apollyon's Tower]] on the [[Circular Island]]. They were fashioned by [[Apollyon]] to hold victims in place during the rites that created [[Apollyon's Phylactery]], drawing their souls and life into the dagger.

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
In DR 1749, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] examined the manacles through the [[Mirror of the Past]], [[Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles Vision|witnessing echoes]] of the sacrifices that fed Apollyon’s transformation into a lich. The mirror visions showed a bound victim repeatedly slashing their wrists while chained in the manacles; sparks of soul‑energy flowed from the manacles into the forming phylactery. The spilled blood pooled into a central well and was later infused with power from the [[Crown of Purity]] to brew Apollyon’s lich‑potion.
