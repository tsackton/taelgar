The Flaming Tempest is a well-built, double-masted [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] longship, with space for a crew of 40 and seaworthy for long voyages over open ocean. 
%%^Date:1747-04-09%%
Captained by [[Urgall the Black]], the Flaming Tempest gained a reputation as a notoriously dangerous pirate ship, raiding shipping traveling towards the [[Straits of Cymea]], aided, in reports of the few survivors, by demonic magic.

When the Flaming Tempest docked at the holy island of [[Vetta]], it was partially destroyed in the storm that was summoned by [[Kaikkea]], in an unsuccessful attempt prevent [[Urgall the Black]] from summoning the demon [[Mashtu the Corruptor]] to consume the sacred waters. However, the storm did trap the demon on the island.

After the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] [[Session 81 (DuFr)|defeated]] [[Mashtu the Corruptor]], The Flaming Tempest was claimed as salvage and brought by to [[Tollen]], where it was sold for raw materials used to help refit [[Vindristjarna]].
