%%could use whereabouts update%%

A spritely halfling trader, sailing a meandering route around the [[Gulf of Chardon]], going where the winds and tides lead. Captained by [[Pippa Goodbarrow]], and crewed by a lively group of mostly young halflings, with a distinct preference for fine food, regular meals, and good ale. 

Unlike many halfling trading ships, this is not really a family operation.
