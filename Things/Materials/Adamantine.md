Adamantine is a valuable and extremely hard metal, prized for the making of arms, armor, and durable magical devices. It can also be used to help stabilize and channel other magical effects and is often incorporated into magical items.

Before the [[Great War]], dwarven miners near [[Raven's Hold]] extracted adamantine from deep veins in their outpost and mines. Though much of that complex lies in ruin, some adamantine was recovered there by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] and later used by the smith [[Jasu]] in [[Karawa]] to reinforce the [[Dunmari Heirloom Shield]]. That shield was eventually destroyed so the adamantine could be reclaimed and forged into the phasing stone harness for [[Vindristjarna]].

Fragments of adamantine were also found in [[Apollyon]]’s tower, and the metal was used in the forging of [[Apollyon's Phylactery]], an adamantine dagger that anchored the lich’s soul.
