# Inkaye

Inkaye is a strange metal that can absorb and repurpose extraplanar energy. 


[[Umli]] described it as a rare shadow‑touched ore that can be purified and reshaped to hold new enchantments.

A fragment of inkaye was embedded in [[Delwath's Elven Breastplate]] after his time in Cha'mutte’s shadow realm. Umli later removed and purified that fragment, and it was used by [[Faldrak Bronzehammer]] and [[Seeker]] at the [[Elemental Forge]] to construct the planar prism for [[Vindristjarna]].
