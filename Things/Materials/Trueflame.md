Trueflame is an alchemical substance that burns with exceptional heat, hot enough to unmake certain enchanted metals.

%%^Campaign:none%%

The alchemist [[Caradoc]] of [[Brantor]] brewed Trueflame for the [[Addermarch Mercenaries]] in DR 1715, first to destroy the [[Serpentine Dagger]] under the supervision of [[Owen Tavish]] in the Temple of the Sibyl at [[Roscombe]]. Caradoc later prepared further doses to help unmake another cursed battleaxe recovered by the same company.

Established that it:
- takes a couple days to make
- requires expensive ingredients, including mercury ash (Caradoc charged the party 150 gp, but that may likely reflect only the portion of the cost he sought to recover, and it could cost considerably more to purchase)
- can be used to destroy certain magic items, particularly weapons of metal
