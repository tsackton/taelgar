Created for Elderwood arc; never introduced in game. 

## Arkad

Provincial capital of the Elderwood border province. A former city-state in the orbit of Kin-Aska, but was not completely destroyed. The name, Ara-qai, was "Chardonized" to Arkad.
 
This area is much more militarized, and the most notable feature of Arkad is the large garrison housed here (larger, even, than Arendum, as these are the reinforcements that cycle through the front lines). The city is defended with high quality walls, and there is a central fort / castle that houses the administration and military command.
 
There is also a frontier outpost of the Hetaeri Magica here, supported by an outpost of the Great Library, a minor provincial archive. This makes Arkad a center of magic in the frontier and a place where it would be possible to pay for someone to cast _Sending_ if desired (and also a place where rumors from Chardon academics will spread quickly, so the party may have some notoriety here already).
 
Vibe is Imperial/magic/military.
