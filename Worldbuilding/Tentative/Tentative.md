This is a good place for stubs that should go in Time, Things, or Gazetteer but where even making a stub isn't sensible because it is not clear what exactly the thing is. This also includes things that so little detail is known about, it is hard to know where to place them. 

Do not include places here that canonically exist (i.e. are important map features on the player map) but that do not have a clear name. For those things, create a ~Place~ page in the proper location. However, if the thing is on the edge of the world, and it isn't super clear what the details could possibly be, tentative is fine. It's a grey area...
