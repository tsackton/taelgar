You've got some really cool stuff, there, mike.  One thing I would wonder
about is the plague- I seem to have this feeling that somewhere along the
line we must have actually done something to stop it that worked.  Granted,
it was probably around 5 or 6 in the morning when it happened, so we don't
remember.  In your history, it seems to just stay there.  If your players
can come up with some kind of temporary plague protection (doubtful, since
the only way we managed was through plane of consciousness tricks, I
think), it might be fun to have them wander through the plague area,
unexplored for over a hundred years- but I think it somehow should have
disappeared when the age ended.  There's nothing wrong with a little
revisionism, if we can't exactly remember- say, um, the shockwave of
magical energy blasted outward when Ch'ummy died was enough to overload and
destroy all the foci (including the one(s) supporting plague) within a few
thousand miles, but another side effect was that it tainted the nearby
nodes with 'evil dragon magic,' so they're really powerful but a little
dangerous. . .
anyway, pretty soon I'll have a more thorough description of Lizardmen,
like how the whole healing, plane of consciousness and prophecy disciplines
are related.  You know, Kyr is definitely still around when your campaign
is happening.  You'll have to work me in somehow.  Ooh. . .
