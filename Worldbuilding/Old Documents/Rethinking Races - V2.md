Feel like post-Tasha's and with 2 years testing/experience I have a much better handle on good race design for D&D now, and also a much better sense of Taelgar lore.
 
A few thoughts. First, just scrap all weird ability score nonsense. Every race gets either three +1 or two +1 depending on strength of the racial package, and you can never increase a single ability score more than +2 with these racial ASIs. There is no real benefit / goal here.
 
Second, scrap subraces. They don't add anything to the game IMO. Instead, have each race offer a choice of options. More interesting, more flexible, and no need for weird lore about why there are multiple different kinds of elves which otherwise doesn't fit into the lore.
 
Third, don't worry about balance so much. No race should have a build-defining trait, but also there should be no reason to try to make everything exactly equal, just make them all flavorful and interesting without being flat/boring.
 
## Categories of Races
 
### Elder Races
 
These are elves, lizardfolk, dwarves, halflings, and stoneborn. They are defined by the racial magic from their connection to the firstborn, as follows:
 
Elves: innately magical, should focus on at will rituals and cantrips or cantrip-like effects, no use per day stuff
 
Stoneborn: disciplines that strengthen mind and body, thematically appropriately to have a use per day or use per short rest when it makes sense
 
Lizardfolk: spiritual connection / augury, can be more use per day stuff but should focus on divination, nature spirits, etc
 
Dwarves: runes, working on a charge system
 
Halflings: racial telepathy and racial memory
 
### Younger Races
 
Humans: probably just revert to variant human as written and give them a free feat, the whole trying to restrict feats is a bit annoying and complicated.
 
Hobgoblins, orcs, etc: probably don’t want these to be PC races, certainly don't invest time right now.
 
### Exotic Races
 
Gnomes, liontaurs, kenku, and peronar ("half-elves") at least exist somewhere in the world.
 
Kobolds of various stripes / draconic descendants appeal and could make a good addition; canonically kobolds are not particularly evil or even enemies of humans like orcs and hobgoblins (descending from elder dragons, not the Void Mind offspring).
 
Fey races like centaurs, satyrs, and fairies should be an option too. Could consider changelings
 
Ravenloft lineages seem fine, any of these can be 'added' to an existing race and at least the vampire and hag ones are a fine fit to Taelgar. Not sure about the reborn lineage.
