Organizing some thoughts on magic and Taelgar here.
 
Key premise: **Magic is the manifestation of extraplanar energy on Taelgar, and all magic or magical effects are associated somehow with extraplanar energy**
 
So the question is how is each 'type' of magic connected to the planes. From D&D tradition and rules, we have arcane magic vs divine magic. In addition, there are magic-like effects, such as ki, and variants of divine magic like druidic magic. And there are racial magics, and things like psionics.
 
For the purposes of the Taelgar Revisited campaign, the most important questions are halfling/elf/dwarf racial magic, ki, and arcane magic, as well as how warlocks work.
 
A general overview, based on planes:
 
**Arcane magic** clearly comes from the Plane of Magic, which intersects with Taelgar at ley lines and ley pools, and permeates the fabric of reality. So this would be bards, wizards, many sorcerers, arcane tricksters, eldritch knights, many magic items. Dwarven and Elven racial magic is also arcane.
 
**Divine magic** ultimately comes from the Void, which is where Eru and Melkor dwell, but is granted by aspects of the divine presence. Clerics and Paladins get their divine magic from aspects of the Divine, whereas Druids and Rangers tap into the direct resonances between the Void and Taelgar.
 
**Psionics** ultimately come from the Plane of Consciousness, which intersects with Taelgar at minds. Halfling racial magic is also connected to the Plane of Consciousness. Although not psionics, ki and Stoneborn racial magic also draws from the Plane of Consciousness.
 
**Prophecy** ultimately comes from the Dreamworld. Lizardfolk racial magic is also connected to the Dreamworld.
 
So generally, the kind of flashy external magic of wizards is arcane magic, connected to the 'upper planes' and the plane of magic. Internal magic, magic that draws upon the innate energy and 'soul' of its caster, or the mental energy of its caster, is connected to the 'lower planes' and the plane of consciousness (which is really more a plane of souls).
 
Ultimately, however, all magic is just the application of extraplanar energy. So anything that can channel extraplanar energy can create magic. Warlocks, for example, may not derive magic from a typical source, as their patron could be any kind of powerful extraplanar individual.
