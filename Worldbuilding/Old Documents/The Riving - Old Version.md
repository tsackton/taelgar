## The Long Breath

The Age of Myth came to an end as Arha and Malik perceived the world they spawned had become consumed by chaos, with little fixed form and endless change wrought by their divine creations. With a gesture, in a moment that was both instantaneous and eternal, they reached out into the world and reshaped reality. 

#### The Embodied Gods

In this extended moment, Arha and Malik created the embodied gods, into whom they imbued some of their Divine energy, the raw power of creation and destruction of their Divine Realm, and tasked them with bringing order to the chaos of the material plane. These Embodied Gods are now known as the Firstborn of the Elder Races: Aldanor and Elmerca, the Living Tree and the Wild Star of the elves; Entamba, the Elder Mountain of the stoneborn; Hazkunde, Bero, Udazkena, and Negu, known as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, the four Tharzen Anzinakoa of the lizardfolk; the Ruler, Runemaster, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, and Farmer, the seven Bahrazel of the dwarves; and Nwana, called the Stranger-Child, Obito, called the Merchant-Musician, and Jemghari, called the Traveler-Storyteller, the two-faced First Ones of the halflings.

The Embodied Gods strode into the world of Taelgar, and reshaped it. Striding through the empires of the children of the Divine, they brought form and order to chaotic realms of pure energy. From their steps, the land was formed and reformed: forests grew in the steps of Aldanor; mountains sprung from the footprints of Entamba; rains followed the wanderings of the Tharzen Anzinakoa, as rivers and marshes grew behind them; vast caverns of beauty and light grew from the hammers of the Bahrazel, and the First Ones followed, weaving stories and memories of the world as it changed. In this new world, all manner of beasts and living things emerged from the divine purpose of Arha and Malik, and the desires of the embodied gods, and the magic of the children of the divine.

#### The Three Despairs

The Void mind had been waiting, and watching, and as Arha and Malik shaped the embodied gods and bestowed them with Divine power, the Void mind stole the breath of the Divine, and out of itself spun the Three Despairs: Umidzka, the Empty; G’Zab, the All Consuming; and Jinnik, the Madness. Through these beings -- not quite gods, unable to reach the world, but imbued with the fundamental energy of the Void -- this mind worked against the creations of the Divine, in the shadows, slowly, never revealing its form or alien thoughts, always seeking to undo the works of Arha and Malik, to bring emptiness back to the Void.

#### The Riving

The long pause, the moment out of time during which the Embodied Gods reshaped the world, ended with the Riving. Drawing on the full strength of their endless Divine power, Ahra and Malik sundered the multiverse, ripping the planes apart, making the world round and the land fixed in form, and, some say, spawning an endless number of parallel realities. Before the Riving, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, all the echo realms, were intertwined with the material plane, but at the moment of the Riving the layers were pulled apart and the echo planes separated into their own realms, still resonating and vibrating with the material plane, but no longer part of it.

Through this moment of shattering, the Three Despairs tested their power, and embodied their own gods. Out of the union of G’Zab and Umidzka, Thark, the God of War Without End was born. Rumors of other creations of the Despairs persist: the Goddess of the End, the Hopeless One, the offspring of G’Zab and Jinnik; the Endless Chaos, the offspring of Umidzka and Jinnik; the Mad One, the embodied avatar of Jinnik. But whether these creations are real, or merely rumor, even the wisest elves do not know. Some have even speculated that the Three Despairs unleashed embodied curses into the world, attributing the curse of undeath and necromancy to Umidzka, and the curse of lycanthropy to Jinnik. 

Diminished in power as the boundaries around the material plane grew thicker and the influx of magic to the world of Taelgar grew weaker, many of the children of the divine fled, or were banished, in this instant. Scholars and loremasters have long sought to catalog and understand the full story of this exodus. While much is not known, most loremasters agree that the archfey and their spawn followed the dreams and shadows into the echo realms, the Feywild and the Shadowfell; and the elder elementals and their creations fled to the Elemental Planes that were the source of their energy and power. Where the great wyrms and titans went, and whether indeed all left the material plane, is a subject of great debate. 

As the multiverse was sundering in the Riving, the realms of the embodied gods spun from the [[Plane of Souls]] and their imaginations, where the form of the land could still be reshaped with a thought.
