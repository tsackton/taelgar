-Dunmari mystery cults kind of like Eberron dragonmarks, especially associated with producing magic items in Dunmari culture; but much of this knowledge is lost
 
-Chalyte powers powerful magics from the lost era, Chardon just now learning to use chalyte again (could power things like airships, etc, if I go that route)
 
-Green Sea has less magic, although Free City of Tollen is Chardon-esque in some ways. Sembara is not anti-magic, exactly, but perhaps a little more mistrusting? Or maybe Cymea?
