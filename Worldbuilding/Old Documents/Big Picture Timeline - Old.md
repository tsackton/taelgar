Drankorian Era: dated starting from the founding of Drankor, ends with the fall of Drankor  
Dark Years: fall of Drankor to establishment of Chardon as new  
Age of Chardon: starting 250 years pre-Cha'mutte, continuing to now
 
1 D. E. (Drankorian Era): founding of Drankor  
~700 D.E.: height of Empire  
~900 D.E.: first plague, fall of Drankor  
~1000 D.E.: Dunmari settle Dunmar  
~1400 D.E.: Great War against Cha'mutte, second plauge  
~1450 D.E.: Chardonian Empire established  
~1612 D.E.: Current day
 
## By Dunmari Reckoning￼

Dated from founding of Dunmar, which was 1200 T.A  
So currently it is ~612 post-Dunmar
 
Maybe 3000 years pre-Hkar, Elder Days type stuff  
Hkar: about 1000 years  
Drankor: about 1000 years  
Post-Drankor: about 500 years to Great War  
About 200 years from Great War to now
 
So say total age of the world is roughly: 5700. Let's just arbitrarily say it is 5881 years old, with some ageless time before the first year that is 'before time' when the Firstborn walked the earth, etc. Years of Myth perhaps.
