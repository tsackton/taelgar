These are old halfling brainstorming notes kept for posterity. 

## Ship Notes

Halfling ship notes - not sure where else to put for now: Halfling ships are organized like large halfling caravans. Usually, members of the clan that owns the ship make up at least half the crew, and fill most, although often not all, the officer positions. The rest of the crew is often made up of various individuals with their own reasons for travel: children of sedentary halflings who want adventure, or land-based clans that want to experience the sea; survivors of shipwrecks and other disasters; partners of the main clan; and other idiosyncratic folks.

Profits of the journey are usually split evenly, after the needs o the ship have been taken care of, although typically excess funds are retained in a ship's account and paid out based on time served on departure of a crew member, or to their clan on death. Purchases with ship funds are typically agreed by majority vote, and all halflings who are part of the crew share equally, and are treated as family.

### History

Halflings don’t record their history; they remember it. The tale of years is told, and told again, created and recreated by the history-tellers and story keepers of each generation, and then recalled as their memories join the racial awareness when they pass on from their individual lives. This living relationship to history means that years are not numbered and dated from fixed points in time. Instead, halflings refer to the song of years and the sagas of eras to mark their history. However, these tellings are held close to the halfling race, and they use more standard reckoning of dates when talking with the outside world. 

For halflings, remembering their history and the worship of the First Ones are deeply connected. History-bearers, those who are especially deeply connected to the racial memory through long practice, tell stories of the past, and often dedicate themselves to composing a great story or song as their life’s work. These songs become the songs of years -- some spanning eras, others a single year. While few know the full song of years, the history-bearers and their connection to the racial mind are part of the fabric of halfling culture and ensure that the old stories are not forgotten. 

### Culture

As reflected in the nature of the First Ones, much of Halfling identity is based around encounter with other. Halflings are wanderers and the traders, seeking outward-facing encounters with other communities and races and cultures. They are also storytellers and musicians, inward-facing bearers of cultural history and identity, and the keepers of the secret halfling language, not taught to outsiders.

As people always on the road, halflings have a very expansive notion of family and hospitality, at least among their own kind. One halfing can always expect to share another’s camp and companionship, and notions of the obligations of hospitality to fellow halflings are deeply ingrained in their culture. 

The traditions of hospitality are in part as strong as they are because of the reality of the halfling racial consciousness. Although the First Ones are centrally important in halfling life and culture, much of their centrality arises from their role as the guardians, shapers, keepers, and ultimately creators of the halfling soulmind, the joint racial consciousness of all halflings. This consciousness is central to halflings’ self conception as race. In significant ways, halflings see themselves not solely as individuals: they are also always part of this whole. Some halflings describe it as like waves on the ocean: individuals are patterns that arise, and come together, and move and come apart, distinct, but fundamentally part of one ocean. This conception of a shared soulmind, a shared racial consciousness, profoundly shapes their encounters with each other:  that they're one single family, connected even if they haven't met. It's not a belief in personal reincarnation, exactly, but it's a different sort of relationship with death to have that sense of how individual and collective meet.

Halfling art and culture embraces the idea that permanent and unchanging things get expressed in unique and changing forms, that the journey, the next step, is always different, and even the same road changes with the seasons and years. They do not build much in the way of permanent structures, and their art does not seek to create artificial perfection. Instead, they see an embrace of imperfection is more reflective of life-as-it-is than something artificially made to be perfect. 

Halflings are noted musicians and bards and storytellers. Halfling artists and musicians, in particular, tend to embrace the notion of music as unique and improvised experience which expresses a universal form -- that the musical changes are the changes but the thing created over them is always unique -- which mirrors halfling understanding of selfhood: that each individual is both unique and, at the same time, merely an expression of an undifferentiated universal oversoul of halfling-ness. Halfling music is usually improvisational because of this, and, in Taelgar, they are the originators of jazz and related musical traditions. 

### Magic


Halfling magical traditions draw heavily on the embodied power of the First Ones and the halfling soulmind. Because of this, halflings are drawn to magic focused on on telepathy, charm, communication, and illusion; as a general matter halfling magic is subtle and halflings that embrace flashy wizard magic are rare, although not unheard of. 

### Law

#### For Outsiders


Halflings have no homeland, and spend most of their lives traveling through and across the lands of others. As they are small people, noted more for their good nature and quick feet than any strength in arms, if a community of larger, stronger folks decides to rob or kill them, there is often little they can do in the moment. 

However, it is hard to get away with murder when the memories of those you kill don’t end with their death, and halflings are deeply concerned with righting those of their kind that are wronged. While most halflings tend towards nonviolence themselves, those that don’t often justify their actions as vengeance and retribution for those of their kind that were wronged.

Between the risk of a quiet dagger and the possibility of economic retribution, most human communities tend to treat halflings well, and give them legal privileges others don’t have. Rumors of places it is not safe to go spread quickly through the halfling community, and these places soon find themselves with no halfling caravans willing to bring goods to market there, or buy goods to take to market elsewhere.

Think about how time flows for halflings

Halfling gods connection to time -- the story of the years already exists and the telling is remembering in a sense

Connection to firstborn, the “memories of the future”

Racial consciousness connects here too, perhaps somehow they can remember the future? 

Halflings count the days since time began, in a long cycle that repeats.
