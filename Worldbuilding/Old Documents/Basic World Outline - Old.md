## West of Mountains
 
**Chardon / Chardonian Empire:**
 
basically set, spans region around Chardon, to the Dunmari border, but largely in the area south of Chardon to south coast and then north up in the interior.
 
**Illoria**
 
Smallish islands off the western coast of Dunmar. Mostly new land. Settled by refugees from the north, a mix of Northlanders, Chardonians, and some Dunmari. Speak a dialect of Chardonian which uses names / place names with a more Sardinian feel and also sometimes random bits of weird language. People are Illorians. Two major islands are: Silanus and Burganos
 
**Penisula:**
 
The tip of the penisula is not Chardonian, it is something else. Maybe non-human area? Wilds?
 
Probably a canal at the base of the penisula constructed by Chardon to allow sea traffic to past north. Perhaps on ruins of an older, even more magical canal that was destroyed?
 
**Northern Coast / alternate name:**
 
The Great Bay area including islands; Northlanders fled to islands during blood years and great war; in past 2 generations have recolonized peninsula
 
**Northern Frontier / alternate name:**
 
The interior area is basically the northern frontier of the Chardonian Empire. The far north is wilds / stranger things, including perhaps the remnants of a hobgoblin empire, vampire kingdoms, etc.
 
**Sayuna Islands / alternate name:**
 
To west of Chardon is an island archipelago; think like Wizard of Earthsea type stuff
 
**Dunmar:**
 
Basically set, spans region south of mountains etc
 
**Still undecided:**
 
Penisula south of Chardon, what is there? Wilds? Something else? Another civ? Non-humans? What else does Taelgar need?
 
I think this should be wilds.
 
Between the eastern border of Chardon and the mountains, what is there? Former elven kingdoms, but what remains?
 
Chardon borderlands with Dunmar, what is there? Is it just Chardon/Dunmar border or something different? Possibly some hillfolk humans, kind of modeled on Bjornlings?
 
**Myraenia home of the Myraenians, an isolated, distant branch of the Northlanders, with refugees fleeing Dunmar after Plague, now also Great War refugees and random outcasts who don't want to live under Chardonian rule. Give their name to the Myraeni Gap (Gap of Chardon)**
 
## East of Mountains
 
**Desolation of the Great War:**
 
Blasted Plains and Plaguelands
 
**Sembara:**
 
Basically set
 
**Cymea:**
 
Basically set
 
**Vostok**:
 
Basically set
 
**Free City of Tollen**
 
## Green Sea
 
West side is Skaegenland, probably some island settlements of some kind
 
The 'eastern' branch of the Dunmari, diverged for hundreds of years now but still culturally related (same gods maybe? But with different names?), which is kind of the gateway to the east
 
Further east: closed cities, crazy barrier islands
 
## South
 
Desert is clear, and then beyond the desert there must be something, maybe here is the true heir to the Drankorian Empire? Or something older and stranger? The true heirs to Hkar? Also of course some good wilderness, and maybe some non-humans?
 
## Oceans
 
Basically have five oceans, in parts:
 
-Green Sea: highly navigable, major trade route, etc, but sailing beyond the barrier islands a different story  
-East of Green Sea: ???  
-South of Dunmar: sea of storms, basically impassible, former location of Hkar, add back in the nickle island?  
-West of Chardon: navigable to islands but then ???  
-North of continent: ice  
-South of continent: ???
 
## Distant Lands
 
Should be at least 3-4 other continents, some small and weird, some that might occasionally send ships?  
But in general, the distant oceans should be *hard* to navigate, magical storms, crazy stuff like that, travel to other continents is possible but not easy?  
Steal from Tolkien with an elven continent that is no longer accessible?

## Non-humans
 
**Dwarves**:  
kingdoms in mountains: central peak, Yuvanti range  
Former kingdom west of Voltara  
Kingdom north of Skaegenland
 
**Elves:**
   

**Stoneborn:**
   

**Halflings:**
   

**Lizardfolk:**  
Tend to live in small enclaves among humans or sometimes in the wilderness
