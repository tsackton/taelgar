> The Age of Myth is the term elves use to refer to the years before time had meaning, when magic was strong and the gods walked the earth. Counted as the First Age of the world among the elves, but not reckoned in the count of years by the dwarves, this age stands apart, a time when the world was constantly changed.
>
> This is the story, told in brief, of the First Age of the world, called the Age of Myth, and the origin of the gods.
>  
  >In the beginning, there was the Void, an endless space that was at once nothing and everything, a formless emptiness in which thought lost all meaning. Into this Void, two beings struggled to come into being, to awaken, to be born. Known most commonly as the [[Divine Presence]], called Arha and Malik, representing life and death, creation and destruction, these beings have taken many other names and forms in the annals of myth and legend of the world, and scholars debate their true nature. 
  >  
   As they came into being, Arha and Malik tore through the fabric of the Void. Through these tears, form erupted: the chaotic, roiling energy of the planes of magic, and the formless silver calm of the planes of souls. Feeling this power flow around and through them, Arha and Malik shaped it into form and being, bringing purpose to the chaotic energies of magic, and sculpting from this vast energy the material plane and the world of Taelgar.
> 
> As Arha and Malik tore through the fabric of the Void, and shaped its energy into creation, something awoke that did not want a world to be, called the Void Mind, or sometimes the Undivine. This utterly alien mind, if that was the right word for it, could not create, even the smallest pebble, for the act of Creation itself was antithetical to its very existence, and it had no power in the realm of Arha and Malik, no magic. However, it could, and did, resist.
>
>After Arha and Malik came to be, they were not still. The first entities to exist in the new world of Taelgar were the children of Arha and Malik. Drawing on the varied powers of the multiverse, the Divine Presence gave birth to powerful, magical beings, in these timeless days of myth and legend.
>
>From the chaotic energy and strength of the planes of magic, the first dragons were born, the great wyrms. These great wyrms spawned the race of dragons, which spread across the land, albeit only echoes and reflections of the god-like elder wyrms. Dragons are the masters of the energy of the plane of magic, weaving spells and shaping reality. But they do not craft things, they do not build, they only collect what others have made. 
>
> From the earth and the sky, the wind and sea, the molten core and solid foundation of the earth itself, the titans were born, again as if gods in power and strength. From them, the race of giants descended, spreading across the land. Giants are the masters of creating and crafting, of twisting reality to create items of great power, embedding runes of power into their work, and shaping the world itself with their magic.
> 
>From the disparate forces of the elemental planes, the elder elementals gave form and thought to the raw power of the elements. From them, the djinni, the ifreerti, the dao, and the marid were given form and power.   
>
>Finally, the last children of the Divine Presence to come into existence were the archfey, reflections of what had come before, but twisted and echoed in the dreamlike world of the Feywild. From the archfey, the fey creatures of the world -- some helpful, others mischievous, or deadly -- spread. 
>As the children of the Divine spread across the nascent world, the Void mind watched, and waited, sometimes whispering quietly in the minds of great beings that strode through existence, but still without power or form. 
>
>The children of the Divine spread during the Age of Myth, before the planes were sundered. As they spread, some built great cities towering over the lands, and others wove dreamscapes of immense power.
>
>Arha and Malik, the Divine Presence, looked across the forming world, and were pleased. But something was missing. As great empires of their children rose, and fell, and the world turned and new forms emerged from the old, Arha and Malik saw that while their children could make many things, everything they made was also a reflection, echo or distortion of something else. Nothing remained still long enough to be named and understood, and the world was ruled by chaos.
