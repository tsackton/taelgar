Paralleling Earth, let's assume that the Drankorians invented the solar calendar and that it is pretty accurate. Perhaps perfectly accurate, with a solar year equal to exactly 365 days.
 
However let's also assume that lots of other cultures had lunisolar years, and so many holidays are tied to lunar months and thus move around in their precise date.
 
If a year is 365 days and a lunar month is exactly 30 days, that means that every 6 years there is an intercalary month to keep things accurate (gets off by 5 days per year).
 
But this leads to things feeling a little unrealistically even because full moons only ever occur on particular days of the month.
 
Instead, ignore leap days but use 29.5 for synod month? That would mean you fall exactly 11 days behind each year, so you can use the adding up to 30 trick to figure out when you need intercalary lunar months. On the other hand, is this worth tracking? Except for dates of religious festivals changing?
