Thoughts on racial magic design goals:
 
Want the 5 elder races to have a unique feel:

1. Dwarves -\> rune magic
2. Lizardfolk -\> commune with spirits
3. Halflings -\> telepathy
4. Goliath -\> modify self
5. Elves -\> 'true magic'
 
However tricky to figure out trade offs between making things too complex and overdesigned vs making things feel mechanically flat.
 
Dwarves are a good example and one that I've seen the most playtest with, with 3 players playing dwarves between two campaigns. Although this may be in part a limitation of the players being kids, their runes don't feel distinct at all from cantrips. So dwarves play just like getting an extra spell, which doesn't feel right even when it is something they remember to use.
