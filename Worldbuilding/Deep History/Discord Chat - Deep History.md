[7/15/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
At the moment it’s mostly just moving stuff around. So far there are a couple of open questions:

1. Were the orcs created at the same time as the elder folk (as the main background history of Taelgar says) or were they created at the same time as humans and hobgoblins (as a mythic history brainstorming doc suggests)


[7/15/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
2. Should anything at all about the southerners (other than “they existed” be considered canonical?) I’d prefer to leave them out except as a “the southerners existed what happened to them tbd”


[7/15/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
3. Is there a firm date for the creation of humans?


[7/15/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
For (1), I don't think there is a canonical answer. I haven't spent much time on the history of the non-People of the Rainbow orcs. Either is plausible, and the metaphysics of how exactly the Void Mind and the Despairs etc work is not clear. There is a certain logic to having all the "elder folk/children of embodied divinities" appear at the same time, but I'm not sure there is a need to be fully committed to parallelism


[7/15/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I imagine this is not really known even among elven scholars -- even if the orcs were created early, they didn't really have a big impact until later -- so probably reasonable to leave it as unknown until more detail is needed. 

Certainly the people of the rainbow don't really maintain tales or myths from their chained days, and so for them their creation story is about the Cloudspinner


[7/15/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
For (2), per Milo's story, rumors of them surely exist in Chardon among other places. So it is more "they exist but no one really goes there because it is too hard so news is all garbled"


[7/15/2024 9:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I can just mention both possibilities with a “who knows what really happened”. Makes sense to me


[7/15/2024 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
For (3), I think there should be but I'm not quite sure what it should be. Something like 1500-1700 maybe?


[7/15/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
There are dates ranging for 1500-2400 in various docs


[7/15/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
I was leaning toward something like 1750-1850


[7/15/2024 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
1850 gives ~2200 years of human culture before the downfall which feels about right


[7/15/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
Be a little earlier might also make sense? 1550 = 2500 years


[7/15/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
the religious history of taelgar doc has I think the most canonical thinking about pre-Downfall humanity, through a religious lens


[7/15/2024 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
(as an aside, did we ever finalize Deno'qai funerary traditions?)


[7/15/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, for human history, I think that the "era of personal deities" feels like it could easily be 1000 years of relative stasis. not much arcane magic development, not much urbanization, pretty idyllic


[7/15/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
for dating, the only real information is that the philosopher's guild suggests the binding stones are more than 3000 years old


[7/15/2024 9:52 PM] .deciusmus
The only real thing we have is the  “traditions around death” doc


[7/15/2024 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
the events in described the philosopher's letter probably take place in the early pantheonic days, or perhaps the small gods era, hard to say precisely. but that puts that kind of transitory period at or before say ~2800


[7/15/2024 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
do we have dates for mariner migrations?


[7/15/2024 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
tollen is founded 3902


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing canonical I think but I haven’t gotten that far and am not at my computer.


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so mariner migrations must be a few hundred years before that at least


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
probably more


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure we need to settle this tonight - i have more session prep to do anyway - but probably something like 1500-1700 is more correct for human origin than the later dates. 2400 is definitely too late, not enough history on Hkar before migrations IMO


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So let’s say 3500 or earlier. Probably first explorers 3300


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah agreed no need to settle right now


[7/15/2024 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
my vision of human history on Hkar is that it is largely driven by developments in magic. so when everyone has a personal deity things don't change much, everyone has a bit of magic that makes life pretty comfortable (although some people create curses and bring the nine hells into existence)


[7/15/2024 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
this continues for a long while, potentially. but once arcane magic comes you get the rapid development of the hkar urban culture, the split with the mariners, etc


[7/15/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
But as a strawman maybe something like:

- 1500 creation
- 2250-2500 northerners
- 2800-2900 earliest pantheons
- 3300 - mariners start
- 3400 - mariners peak
- 3500 - mariners end


[7/15/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
But with the northerners and pantheon dates perhaps moved a bit or a lot


[7/15/2024 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, something like that is fairly reasonble as a rough starting point to work out. mariners might shift a bit later depending on how long it takes them to found tollen (not sure it would take 500 years to settle the length of the green sea, that seems a bit excessive)


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. It depends on how long they spend mucking about in the magic islands having religious schisms


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
downfall is like 4100 or thereabouts


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[7/15/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
It’s probably worth leaving the exact mariner dates a little vague in case we need more time for them wandered around in the far east




[7/16/2024 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
I went with 1520 for the date of creation just to have something


[7/16/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
just playing around with this a bit, I think this timeline isn't quite right.  The idea is that there is explosive change in Hkar in the aftermath of the northerners leaving and encountering the Elder Folk, but 300-400 years for the development of the earliest pantheons seems too long


[7/16/2024 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
the only firm date we have is Sargon was defeated no later than ~2800. (So that the philosopher's "more than 3000 years ago" works). But no reason it couldn't have been 2500 or 2200 even, right?


[7/16/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, maybe the northerners left later? like 2600


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah any of those options works. Decision is about the balance of time in the various phases of hkaran history.  There are enough unknowns that it seems a bit hard to pin down


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
on the one hand, no reason to decide


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
on the other hand, some arbitrary decisions help sometimes


[7/16/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
at the moment, I am thinking something like:

~300 years of "personal deities" era. 
~700 years of "small gods" era

Northerner migration is the ending of the small god era

~200 years of rapid change

~1500 years of the pantheonic era


[7/16/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not really sure if that is right. It's hard to know how rapidly the pantheonic era should conslidate


[7/16/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
into Mos Numena


[7/16/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I think one consideration is that to a certain extent, this plays into the question of why the downfall happens. 

The original conception from high school was supposed to be kind of opposed to the Tolkien mythic history of "humans are punished for challenging the gods" type thing. So the Downfall doesn't happen because humans get greedy, it happens because of evil gods or the Void Mind or whatever tbd forces. It happens to humans, basically, more like a natural disaster. 

I think this, to a certain extent, argues for a relatively shorter pantheonic era. If the Void Mind is trying to stop humans, the Hkaran urban elite is developing high magic and cooperating with elves, why wait?


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I mean, I definitely like the vibe of the Downfall as a "from the outside" disaster


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
But the Void Mind might need to wait to gain strength


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, there are possible reasons why it could happen anytime, of course


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. grow the hobgoblin armies in secret or whatever


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
If the Sargon date is going to stay canonical there isn't really room to make the pantheonic era much shorter than 1500 years


[7/16/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Because I think it should definitely be true that the transition from small gods to pantheons is short


[7/16/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it makes a ton of sense for their to be a long period of "proto pantheons" that Sargon can fit into. Right?


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
well, what there is no information about is what the Chainshroud actually was. Sarqon could be a full-fledged god worshipped by a cult.


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
I guess Sargon could be a 'big small god'


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
The other constraint is that the northern migration needs time, once it happens, to spread across Taelgar and diversify


[7/16/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
So I think the northerners can't be too early


[7/16/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
* i mean too late


[7/16/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, my thought is that there is effectively one period of rapid change in Hkar: the evolution from small gods to big pantheonic gods.

And that this period of rapid change should be:
* Short (100 - 300 years, but probably closer to 100 than 300)
* Soon after the Northerners leave and the humans and Elder Folk start interacting


[7/16/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
So, rereading the religious history doc, I feel like the era of personal deities/cults and the early pantheonic stages could last for quite a long time. the small gods -> pantheons does need to happen quickly


[7/16/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
for example, I'm not sure why "In a variety of ways, the era of cults quickly becomes an era of small gods. It likely starts with ancestor worship - if your mother was a powerful divine sorcerer, and you benefitted from her personal deity in life, it would be very natural to continue praying to her personal deity in death." has to be true


[7/16/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, the era of cults is kind of undeveloped


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I'm not sure it matters when the transition from personal deities to cults is


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Similarly, the transition from "early pantheonic" to "proto-Mos-Numena" can be anytime


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
what does seem clear is that the small gods is an important but brief transitory period, and a lot of things happen:
- northern migrations
- contact with elder folk
- arrival of arcane magic in force


[7/16/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
The thing that impacts everything else is basically when does the small gods -> early pantheonic transition happen


[7/16/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure if the small gods period has to be brief. You could have a short cult phase and a long small god phase, for example


[7/16/2024 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
so there are actually some conflicted metaphysics about the outer planes and the religious history docs


[7/16/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., where do places like Arborea and the Nine Hells come from? they are supposed to be kind of inchoate belief from the early days but this conflicts a bit with the idea that it isn't until the early pantheonic days that people start imaging  extraplanar divinities


[7/16/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, that is neither here nor there for dating


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
in my mind, the northerner migration, contact with elder folk, spread of arcane magic, and the pantheonic tradition are all tied together and happen in a relatively short window


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. Strongly agree


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
say within about 200-500 years max


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/16/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
so how much history is about right for the northerners on the main continent?


[7/16/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
And of course this needs to be during the "small gods" era, but it could be that small gods only lasts 200-300 years and overlaps almost entirely with the "transition" period.

Or it could be that small gods lasts 1000 years and ends with the migrations


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
There needs to be enough time that Zimka/Vos are well established in Sembara when the mariners show up


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
I think that's the main constraint really


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't necessarily take the northerners that much time to get there


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
But the world isn't _that_ big. It could probably be as little as 800 years and as many as 1800


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
which says, say 2100 - 3100


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if Tollen is founded in 3902 that implies mariners make it to Western Gulf by say 3700 at the earliest? Tollen is supposed to be one of the first mariner cities in that part of the Green Sea


[7/16/2024 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
I was using the founding of Tollen as the function "point of contact" but probably 100 years before is better


[7/16/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
give the Zimka like 8-10 generations minimal in the highlands before then only pushes their arrival back to 3100ish? plus/minus a hundred years


[7/16/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
sorry wrong math, more like 3400


[7/16/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so assume very roughly 800-1000 years to migrate, you could have northerns make first contact with continent around 2400-2600


[7/16/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Although I think 1000 years is a very long time to migrate. There are all kinds of reasons they might have been moving faster


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right but doesn't mess anything up for them to have been in the region for 20-30 generations, or 100 generations


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
I'd stick with my the migration should probably not be before 2000 or after 3000 but anything else could work


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yes I think that is good


[7/18/2024 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
Did you push any notes on this yet?


[7/18/2024 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
in the history-rewrite branch


[7/18/2024 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
I didn't want to do it in main because I was doing a lot of deleting and moving wanted to be able to review a diff to make sure I deleteing the right stuff


[7/18/2024 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure if I got this exactly captured


[7/18/2024 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
I have a session in 1.5 weeks and am mostly switching my taelgar focused stuff to session prep for a bit


[7/18/2024 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus
I need to finally actually develop drankor ha ha so working on a lot of history over the next couple of weeks, fwiw


[7/18/2024 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
you should definitely look at my history-rewreite


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i am tempted to rewrite a little to move away from the Tolkien-esque "elder folk" "elder days" "ages of the world" framework


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
I was pretty tempted to get rid of the whole "5th age"


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that seems pointless. it was originally an idea for elven timekeeping before we came up with the ka cycle


[7/18/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
right, I guess with the ka cycle why would elves have some different "ages" concept? i mean, I guess you might refer to some set of ka by a name, but that would be very elvish


[7/18/2024 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
so really, you can imagine a mythic structure that is basically

"Time before time"
"Time before humans"
"History"


[7/18/2024 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
But it might be good to have a term to refer to the first two categories... whether that uses the word "Age" I'm not sure


[7/18/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
well, i guess the real idea is that from a metaphysical point of view, there is just the "Mythic Age" (before time) and "History". but that doesn't mean that scholars wouldn't make up names. So from a human point of view, you might have the Hkaran Era and the Drankorian Era


[7/18/2024 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
and humans might actually consider the Mythic Age to be everything pre-existence of humans


[7/18/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I was thinking from the perspective of a Drankorian scholar you'd have

the time before time
the time before humans
the Hkaran Era
the current time

from the perspective of a Chardonian scholar, you'd add

the time before time
the time before humans
the Hkaran Era
the Drankorian Era
the current time

but actually the real dividing point is probably the fall of Drankor, not the fall of Cha'mutte


[7/18/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
from a "making stuff up" point of view, the difference between the time before humans the Hkaran Era is small


[7/18/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. in many ways the world building history is easier if we don't think of the creation of humans as some "New Age!!!" but just an event


[7/18/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
that avoids eg feeling like the timing of orcs or hobgoblins has to be related to some "age transition"


[7/18/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think from a worldbuilding perspective there are really three substantial eras:
- before the planes are separated by the Riving
- between the Riving and the Downfall
- between the Downfall and the current day


[7/18/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
right


[7/18/2024 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that the Age of Myth, the Age of Creation, and the Age of Humanity are reasonable worldbuilding internal names but each could conceivably have different names in different cultures as well, tbd. to the extent to which we want to invest in that kind of worldbuilding.


[7/18/2024 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
right. that probably makes sense too, and is a slightly different dividing line (i.e. presuming the Age of Creation ends with the creation of Humans)


[7/18/2024 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
or you could imagine the Age of Humanity divided into the Hkaran Era, the Drankorian Era, and the post-Drankorian Era


[7/18/2024 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
again, from a worldbuilding-internal naming standpoint mostly


[7/18/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
one idea I had that i'm not sure about is that the downfall is actually the end of the age of creation, and rather than having a bunch of "void mind" races lingering in the shadows and growing in strength for a thousand years, you basically have wars break out kind of suddenly, and really have for the first time in history (since the riving) the concept of large scale war.


[7/18/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
the downfall is basically the last gasp of the void mind to destroy the work of the age of creation


[7/18/2024 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
and something about the downfall is actually significantly more mythically/metaphysically real, it locks into a place a bunch of metaphysics and further restricts magic in some way. maybe moving the outer planes even further from the material plane or something.


[7/18/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea of downfall being metaphysically significant... but I also like the elves having this long period of wariness and empire building... and the current semi-canon for the dwarven split is those who want to fortify the underground vs those who want to flee the underground


[7/18/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
So there could be advantages to having a long slow buildup


[7/18/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
If gnomes only left in the 200 years before the downfall or something they should be more well known across taelgar, right?


[7/18/2024 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess my thought is those kinds of premonitions are more interesting if it is really a magical thing: elmerica is warning the elves of something new, all consuming war, that the that world has never seen; maybe before this time the Warrior of the Bahrazel is something else, not the Warrior, and it is during this time a cult of the Warrior grows up among the dwarves, some thinking this is dangerous and terrible and others believing their crazy stories


[7/18/2024 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus
the dangerous and terrible folks lose and leave, and dwarven society starts inventing armies


[7/18/2024 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I don't disagree, but it seems odd to have the premonitions 1000 years before anything bad happens


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
Even elves aren't going to plan for 1000 years in the future


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
no, but the firstborn don't know when exactly something bad is going to happen


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
its like e.g. early christian predictions about the end of the world or something


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
right, I mean, if the premonitions start in 2000 and the wars don't erupt until 3800 that's a long time to be having faith in the premonitions


[7/18/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
It has a very different flavor than the premonitions start in 2000 and are proven true in 2150 or 2200


[7/18/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
in, actually, a not dissimilar way to christian evolution of the end of the world as being seen as less and less "mainstream" as it kept not happening


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
doesn't mean that can't be what happened, I just think it changes the flavor in a way I'm not sure I love


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, yes, this is part of why the downfall is so bad. if all of elven society believed that war was going to break out in 100 years they'd have been better prepared and all their empires wouldn't have been lost


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
thats a good point


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
the circle I'm trying to square is basically how badly the non-humans lose


[7/18/2024 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
i mean obviously on some level they win but at massive cost. so why weren't they more prepared?


[7/18/2024 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
What if you have something like...
(a) Both the dwarven and elven firstborn have these major premonitions of disaster, but like, in 2000 or even 1500. A long time before the downfall wars
(b) At first, both societies largely accept them, and start preparing for war
(c) After a hundred years of nothing happening, starts to be schisms. Gnomes split. Disagreement amongst the elves
(d) Say after another hundred years, small cracks that let in creatures from the Far Realms into the deeps start to appear
(e) this is nothing "earth shattering" and doesn't really impact elves at all, but it is enough to entrench the dwarven warrior thruh and it becomes this kinda smallish group who defends the deep from the occasional aberration


[7/18/2024 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
Then 1000+ years pass, and the elves who accept the possibility of danger have become something like a small cult of sorts, the watchers or whatever


[7/18/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
Probably needs a bit of work, but I feel like the "isolated watchers not quite believed" works better for elves than dwarves


[7/18/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
Not sure what stoneborn/halflings/lizardfolk are doing all this time


[7/18/2024 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
yes. in my sentient ocean history, canonically the riving is supposed to open cracks to the far realms, and while it would in theory take some time for e.g. mind flayers to show up those make sense as the "first enemies"


[7/18/2024 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus
I like this. you also have things like undead, and maybe lycanthropy, and a few other evils. greedy dragons and the like, and maybe some remnant giant populations who see small folk as lesser. so it isn't like the world is missing conflict. but you really don't have "war", except deep in the underdark where dwarves fight mind flayers and other strange aberrations


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
there is just enough danger so that the watcher elves or whatever aren't completely unbelievable, but the idea that a few undead or a greedy dragon would spawn vast armies seems difficult to believe


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
And in particular, nothing like the "First Age of Elves on Middle Earth in the long fortified war against Morgoth" vibe


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
I like that


[7/18/2024 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
One thought. Does the Void Mind lose because of the efforts of the firstborn races, or is it something else?

Is the Void Mind winning until somehow a trap is set on Hkar, and massive armies of hobgoblins and orcs and whatever else all sail to Hkar and then the place is sunk to destroy the armies?

Or is the "mainland" battles more even, or at least not quite so hopeless?


[7/18/2024 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
What if there is something specific about Hkar that empowers the divine spark


[7/18/2024 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
I've always kind of imaged the destruction of Hkar as a trap, yes


[7/18/2024 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
but nothing canonical in this regard


[7/18/2024 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
Here's an alternative idea though...

When the Divine Presence creates Hkar + the humans, there is literally something metaphysical of themselves that is embedded in Hkar or a part of Hkar. This strengthens and empowers the divine spark in the humans.

During the Downfall Wars, the agents of the Void Mind learn of this, and realize if they can possess and corrupt this whatever, they can destroy and corrupt everything that was imagined with the divine spark, perhaps even humanity itself, and dramatically weaken the Divine Prescene. End the ability to create, at some level.


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
And although the battle is still raging, and the Void Mind forces haven't won, it is too much of a risk. And so the Divine Prescence takes back this whatever which sinks Hkar


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
And metaphysically, makes them farther away from Taelgar, and makes the creation of new gods harder


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
weakens divine magic.


[7/18/2024 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
i think there is something in that


[7/18/2024 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
i think actually that cleans up a lot of the complications of the outer planes -- e.g. why is their a fixed set of outer planes and why are some not associated with deities?


[7/18/2024 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
It needs work, I think, but it plays back into the idea that the earlier and closer the humans are to Hkar, the easier it is to create gods. This explains why there are not so many new religions always forming (and maybe even the mariners too something of this power with them, which is why the east has more divine magic and more religions in general)


[7/18/2024 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not totally sure I want to say that *no* new gods appear after the downfall, but I think it works very well to have an "easy" era of god formation transition to a "hard" era. and that no new *planes* are formed after the downfall, perhaps excepting divine realms


[7/18/2024 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
(although metaphyiscally I think divine realms and non-divine outer planes are somewhat distinct)


[7/18/2024 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
and making that power embedded in the physical location of Hkar itself works well to explain Hkar's destruction


[7/18/2024 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
Right and it could explain some of the earliest outer planes


[7/18/2024 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus
and also perhaps why the elven empire that was in dunmar gets decimated. hobgoblin armies cut down hundreds of thousands of trees to construct a massive armanda


[7/18/2024 11:40 AM] .deciusmus
maybe in the first generation of humans, born themselves with the divine spark, and living on Hkar at the center of this magic literalyl create planes with their dreams. 

So places like Abyss/Hell/Aborea are the planes created by the dreams of the very first generation of humans.


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
then *populated* by the divine familiars created by the later generations?


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
not sure about that...


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
right, I like that


[7/18/2024 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
I gotta go do some work. but the other thing to think about is the vibe of the elves & other firstborn races....

At the end of the Downfall wars is it more like:

that was terrible but we won by our actions OR

that was terrible and we would have all been wiped out if Hkar didn't sink


[7/18/2024 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
(my instinct says the first is better, but not sure)


[7/18/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
I think my idea of the vibe of the downfall based on this new idea of the void mind wanting to corrupt hkar is that "without our actions, hkar would have been overwhelmed, but ultimately without the sinking of hkar the war could never have ended"

so basically, destruction of hkar was a necessary cost, but without the price paid by the firstborn, probably the armies that reached hkar would have achieved their goal and captured the divine spark or whatever before hkar could be destroyed. something like that

i have a bunch of meetings this afternoon but am going to try to rewrite the history of taelgar doc on the rewrite branch with these ideas



[7/25/2024 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a rewrite of the history of taelgar (to history-rewrite) branch that restructures age of divinity into four eras:
- growth of humanity from ~1500-2200, when not much happens, basically pre-history
- contact with elder folk from ~2200-2500, when arcane magic + idea of incorporeal gods triggers massive social and cultural change on hkar
- migrations and emigration, from ~2500-3500, starting with the northerner departures and ending with the marniner departures, with at least one (the southerener) migration in between, but possibly more
- arcane hegemony, from ~3500-4122, when the arcane urban culture gets very powerful, mos numena develops, etc; ends with downfall


[7/25/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
logic is basically that contact with elder folk / introduction of arcane magic breaks a long period of status and the social change associated triggers people to start leaving. northerners would be the last of the "small gods" people, after they depart hkar is all pantheonic. mariners are potentially the last (major) non-mos-numena culture, after they leave mos numena gets increaasingly strong and other religious communities (e.g., dunmari?) get increasingly isolated, tend to leave


[7/25/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
the dates are not precise in the doc I pushed and could be shifted
