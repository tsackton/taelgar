This page captures some of the reasoning behind decisions in the [[Historical Framework]] document, and also captures some of our older thinking that has since been discarded.

The primary chat that clarified a lot of this is [[Discord Chat - Deep History]]. Some additional information is found in:

### Downfall Aftermath
Some older documents had more invention that is currently considered canonical around the Dunmari and southern cultures:

>- The proto-Dunmari largely settle on the arid fringes of the great desert, stretching mostly along the north edge of the desert in the savannas and grasslands there.
>-  The southern culture has been devastated by the sundering of the north and south continents, and has splintered into three groups
>- The ‘south continent’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which emerged on the southern continent and merged with Hkaran refugees
>- The ‘south islander’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which rebuilt a culture in the newly formed seas, bays, and islands along the (new) south coast, as well as the western coast along the Sea of Storms, south of the desert.
>- The ‘south mainland’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which forms in the interior of the southern part of the north continent; these cultures have some eastern influences on the east coast.
>- A new, unique desert culture emerges, with some proto-Dunmari, some southern, and some eastern influence, as well as a strong influence of the gnomes, who shelter these people during the worst of the Downfall years.

### Drankorian Expansion
Some old documents have some useful "pre-canon" ideas:

Founding:
%% Note: This has probably been superceded by the "circular island with 2+ million people", which suggests that it was never a small settlement %%
>The City of Drankor is founded in the year 4133, only 11 years after the Downfall of Hkar. Although initially a small settlement in a fertile river valley, it quickly attracts refugees who have landed along the coast of the Sea of Storms, and by 4180 Drankor is a city proper, recreating as best possible the grand urban centers of Hkar, and the people of Drankor have begun to spread north, east, and west, settling and farming the fertile grasslands and remnant woodlands of what was, before the Downfall, a great forest and elven kingdom. Fires swept across most of the land, burning the trees, but the rains were plentiful and the soil fertile, so new life sprung back rapidly in this land. 
  

Suggestion that there are troubles to the south and east:
>By 4300 or so, the nascent Drankorian Empire stretches along the coast of the Sea of Storms, as far east as the shores of ~GreatBay~, as far west as the Nevos Sea, and north into the empty expanses of the land that is now Dunmar. Many in Drankor, only a few generations removed from the days of Hkar, turn east and south, trying to reclaim old trading connections. But the Sea of Storms was chaotic to navigate, the mountainous lands to the east the home of hobgoblins and worse, and the lands to the south torn by upheaval and destruction, desertification and flooding. So, the Drankorian Empire turned its sights north.

### Names of "Ages"
Some earlier brainstorming referred to these eras as "the Age of Myth", "the Age of Creation", and "the Age of Humanity", but we have largely decided to avoid the Tolkien-esque "Ages of the World" framing.  In general, early versions of this history, although unique, suffered from a Tolkien-esque vibe and language that we are now trying to mostly avoid. 

In some early conceptions of elves, the idea of "ages" was a uniquely elven thing. This has been replaced by the [[Elven Cycle of Generations|ka]]. In our high school game, the idea of ages was meant to represent the great struggles between dragons, but this has largely been abandoned, preserved only in the dominance of [[Cha'mutte]] on the period between the [[Fall of Drankor]] and the [[Great War]].

### Basic Structure of History
Tim originally conceived as the mythic structure of history to be something like:
1) the giants and dragons and fey and elements build huge empires and the gods walk the earth, but that is too chaotic so the planes are separated
2) the gods create the elder races, who expand and build empires and develop, and probably invent magic and things like that, but that is kinda boring so the gods create humans
3) humans expand and grow, but so do the "evil races", and then there is a huge battle and Hkar sinks
4) the age of "human history" begins and ends with the war against Cha'mutte
5) present day into the "new age"

In the current historical framework document, I have largely moved away from a 'Goldilocks' vision ("too much change" then "too little change", and then with the introduction of humans "just the right amount of change"). Instead, I've preferred to a structure where the motivations of the Divine Presence are left ineffable. Instead, the mythic history is structured around a basic flow of:
1) Time and stability don't exist - ends with the Riving
2) A broad "period of creation" which is categorized first by significant new creation (including of humans) and then by growing conflict with the Void Mind over whether reality will continue to exist - ends with the Downfall, which is ultimately a victory for the Divine Presence
3) "Normal" history, post Downfall, when the Void Mind and the Divine Presence both are no longer active in any meaningful way, and only gods and creations of the "period of creation" can still impact the multiverse

There are some important considerations to the structure of "period 2" here though. Quoting Tim's notes:

> The idea behind 2 is to try to make this feel different than Tolkien. Tolkien doesn't really have a period when the elves are just kind of doing their thing -- the conflict with Morgoth runs through the entire first age, and even the mythic prehistory alternates between times when Morgoth is fighting and times when he is imprisoned. So I definitely want a time that is just kind of elder races doing their thing, with little or no conflict (excepting things like the sundering of the dwarves, and anything else that gets invented later to explain things like drow or other exotic races, like maybe if I ever want to use yuan-ti they can be sundered lizardfolk). There is also a nice kind of parallel to having period 2 end with the [[Divine Presence]] stepping into the world to create humans and that allowing the Despairs to sneak in as well and do their thing; during period 2 the world is kind of preserved in glass in a way. 

This vibe should be preserved, but without the implication that (a) the creation of humanity is a fundamental turning point and (b) that the Divine Presence created humanity because the world was too boring.  The important thing to preserve is this idea that whatever the overall scope of conflict between the Void Mind and Divine Presence in this period, there was a long and significant period when the elves, halflings, lizardfolk, dwarves, and stoneborn were simply growing without significant conflict.

## Timing of Creation of Humans
In general, the creation of humans needs to be serve two goals.
* There needs to be enough time before it so that the Elder Folk have had time to grow large empires and also to have forgotten creation itself
* There needs to be enough time after it for the many developments of human culture and religion

There are some thoughts in [[Demographic Modeling]]. A date of 1520 is somewhat arbitrary, but it probably can't be much sooner than 1400 or later than 1900.

## Migration Timeline
The current timeline is based on a proposal from Tim that would shift the contact with elder folk period a little earlier, and move the northern migrations *after* contact, as the beginning of a wave of emigrations triggered in part by the social and cultural upheavals caused by the introduction of arcane magic and the idea of incorporeal gods.
