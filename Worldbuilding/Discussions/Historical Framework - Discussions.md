This page captures some of the reasoning behind decisions in the [[Historical Framework]] document, and also captures some of our older thinking that has since been discarded.

### Names of "Ages"
Some earlier brainstorming referred to these eras as "the Age of Myth", "the Age of Creation", and "the Age of Humanity", but we have largely decided to avoid the Tolkien-esque "Ages of the World" framing.  In general, early versions of this history, although unique, suffered from a Tolkien-esque vibe and language that we are now trying to mostly avoid. 

In some early conceptions of elves, the idea of "ages" was a uniquely elven thing. This has been replaced by the [[Elven Cycle of Generations|ka]]. In our high school game, the idea of ages was meant to represent the great struggles between dragons, but this has largely been abandoned, preserved only in the dominance of [[Cha'mutte]] on the period between the [[Fall of Drankor]] and the [[Great War]].

### Basic Structure of History
Tim originally conceived as the mythic structure of history to be something like:
1) the giants and dragons and fey and elements build huge empires and the gods walk the earth, but that is too chaotic so the planes are separated
2) the gods create the elder races, who expand and build empires and develop, and probably invent magic and things like that, but that is kinda boring so the gods create humans
3) humans expand and grow, but so do the "evil races", and then there is a huge battle and Hkar sinks
4) the age of "human history" begins and ends with the war against Cha'mutte
5) present day into the "new age"

In the current historical framework document, I have largely moved away from a 'Goldilocks' vision ("too much change" then "too little change", and then with the introduction of humans "just the right amount of change"). Instead, I've preferred to a structure where the motivations of the Divine Presence are left ineffable. Instead, the mythic history is structured around a basic flow of:
1) Time and stability don't exist - ends with the Riving
2) A broad "period of creation" which is categorized first by significant new creation (including of humans) and then by growing conflict with the Void Mind over whether reality will continue to exist - ends with the Downfall, which is ultimately a victory for the Divine Presence
3) "Normal" history, post Downfall, when the Void Mind and the Divine Presence both are no longer active in any meaningful way, and only gods and creations of the "period of creation" can still impact the multiverse

There are some important considerations to the structure of "period 2" here though. Quoting Tim's notes:

> The idea behind 2 is to try to make this feel different than Tolkien. Tolkien doesn't really have a period when the elves are just kind of doing their thing -- the conflict with Morgoth runs through the entire first age, and even the mythic prehistory alternates between times when Morgoth is fighting and times when he is imprisoned. So I definitely want a time that is just kind of elder races doing their thing, with little or no conflict (excepting things like the sundering of the dwarves, and anything else that gets invented later to explain things like drow or other exotic races, like maybe if I ever want to use yuan-ti they can be sundered lizardfolk). There is also a nice kind of parallel to having period 2 end with the [[Divine Presence]] stepping into the world to create humans and that allowing the Despairs to sneak in as well and do their thing; during period 2 the world is kind of preserved in glass in a way.Â 

This vibe should be preserved, but without the implication that (a) the creation of humanity is a fundamental turning point and (b) that the Divine Presence created humanity because the world was too boring.  The important thing to preserve is this idea that whatever the overall scope of conflict between the Void Mind and Divine Presence in this period, there was a long and significant period when the elves, halflings, lizardfolk, dwarves, and stoneborn were simply growing without significant conflict.
