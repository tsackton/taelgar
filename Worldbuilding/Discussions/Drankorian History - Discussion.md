See also [[Historical Framework - Discussions]]. This includes some more specific older text and discussions about Drankorian history that is a bit too specific to the Drankorian internals (rather than the broad sweep of history) to put in the broader page.

## Early Expansion

An older document suggests that there were significant wars on the eastern frontier. There is no reason for this to be canonical, but also no reason for it not to be, necessarily:

>Over the next 100 years (~DR 100 - 200), the Drankorian Empire expanded north and west, to the Myrenai Gap in the west and the southern reaches of the ~Irebor~ river valley in the north. Most of this land was empty, fertile territory, left unpopulated after the fall of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. During this time, most of Drankor’s attention was focused on the eastern borders, where a series of defensive fortifications are constructed between the ~EastBranchMahar~ and the ~GreatBay~, to provide defense against incursions from the survivors of the Armies of Despair that fought during the Downfall Wars. On the northern frontiers, more than 1000 miles from Drankor and the center of the Empire, contact and trade with the northern peoples, both east and west of the ~CentralMountains~, slowly began to grow.
  
  >The first war the Drankorian Empire fought was against the hobgoblins of the ~EasternMountains~, a short decisive victory, and a key moment in the self image of the nascent empire. The decisive turning point in this war was the deployment of mages, both human and Peronar, and from this conflict the use of war magic becomes a major focus of the Drankorians. 
 
 >However, despite a clear victory, the Drankorians did not seek to expand east. The land beyond the mountains was barren and empty, rugged unpopulated wastelands unsuitable for farming, and even the shores of the [[Green Sea]] were largely empty. The nomadic Dunmari and other desert people traveled through this land occasionally, but the civilization growing in the coastal lands abandoned by the lizardfolk during the Downfall is more than 1000 miles away  and the Drankorians did not push far into the wastes of ~NAME~. 

%%Mike note:  Assume the "civilization growing in the coastal lands..." is some flavor of the "MTP civilization" or the "HK civilization%% %%
