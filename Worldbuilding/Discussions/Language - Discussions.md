This page captures some of the reasoning behind decisions in the [[Languages]] document.

The key source for most of this is [[Discord Chat - Languages and Humanity]] which outlines a different way of thinking about languages than prior discussions.

In particular, we decided to move Sembaran away from a purely Drankorian derivate into a more blended tongue that is fundamentally more Eastros than anything else.

## Human Language Familes
This section is intended to be both canonical and sufficiently vague as to not block new invention. Broadly, the assumption is that each of the [[Human Cultures of Taelgar|migrations from Hkar]] map to a specific language family:
* Early Explorers = Northros
* Pre-Urban Exodus = undefined southern tongue
* Mariner Migration = Eastros
* Downfall Refugees = Drankorian

Minor migrations, such as the Dunmari, have potentially unique histories, and may or may not fit into one of the language families above.

When determining real-world language analogues:
* Northos in general uses Semitic languages
* Eastros and any subsequent migration use Indo-European languages, with Eastros tending towards Slavic/Germanic, and Drankorian tending towards Italic/Hellenic. Other migrations (i.e. Dunmari) that are after the mariner migration should probably be their own branches of the Indo-European language family.
* The Pre-Urban exodus is explicitly undefined, and could be Indo-European or something else,  but earlier conversations suggested probably Asian

Non-Human tongues should generally avoid Indo-European or Semitic, but also do not necessarily need a clear and well defined mapping to real-world human languages.
