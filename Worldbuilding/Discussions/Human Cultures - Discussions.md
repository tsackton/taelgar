This document outlines some removed points or other areas of brainstorming or historical interest from [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]].

### Northerner Migration
At one point, it was canonical that the northerner migration first reached the mainlain in Illoria. This has been removed in favor of a more general "west coast" statement to allow variety in future worldbuilding.

## Mawar
Note from Tim on Discord:
>Mawar has always been a bad fit for a northerner origin, IMO, but i haven't developed its history in detail in large part because so much of the history of the west is a bit of a blank slate. i like mawar a lot as a place and i'm kind of tempted to leave it blank for now, since it is a reasonable place i might want to set a campaign in in the future. there is actually a semi-developed ancient history there about elemental cults from one of the mawar adventures that i never typed up

Old notes:
>Also descendants of people who fled Drankorian expansion, seaward. While never formally conquered, these people were much more significantly influenced by Drankor, and adopted Mos Numena albeit with some quirks, retaining a bit of their intercessory heritage with the prevalence of "saints and heroes" as a focal point of prayer among the Mawar. Although politically diverged, this is presumably also related to the culture of the whole "Mawar Bay / Great Bay" area, including the coast west of Voltara and the island off Mawar. Potentially some religious diversity, with northern folk religions also playing a role in some parts of the Mawaran cultural spread (perhaps on the big island or the northern stretches of the Great Bay there is a more pure ancestor worship variant of the tanshi tradition with old roots).

> An alternative might be for Mawar to be, for undefined historically contingent reasons, somewhat unique. I'm not sure it has to be related to the ~Great Bay~ cultures along the west coast of Voltara. 

> This would leave the Voltaran coast plains and northern parts of the bay not-very-related to Mawar, but I actually think leaving some blanks on the map is a good idea in terms of having places where someone in Voltara or Chardon or Mawar would say there are no people there, as well as places that just no one knows even exist (the big island chain)

### Southern Migration
An earlier version of the human culture document stated:

> As the east begins to urbanize and explore, there is an early wave of migration that settles primarily in the central and southern regions of the mainland. These people and their descendants leave Hkar during the early growth of pantheonic religions, and their religion is left undetermined. They are referred to as the **Southerners** (better name needed?). They largely do maintain contact and trade relationships with the Hkaran homeland, and are probably best thought of as the first Hkaran colonies on the mainland, perhaps with a vibe initially similar to early Greek and Phoenician Mediterranean colonies. They grow rich on trade with Elder Folk and probably develop into powerful civilizations, left undeveloped for now. 

This is not considered canonical but is worth preserving as a potential idea.

### Downfall Refugees
Older text:

>The Downfall Wars involve a major war in Hkar that (somehow) leads to the destruction of the entire continent and the reshaping of the world. The highly magical urban culture, with a strong pantheon, at this point dominates much of Hkar, and it is this culture that is the predominate culture of the refugees who found Drankor. This is the **Drankorian** culture. 

>There of course may be other refugees that fled at the same time, and founded other cultures as yet determined, with different characteristics. 

This implies that there might have been Downfall Refugees potentially worshipping something other than Mos Numena. My opinion is that that introduces unneeded variance and complexity to the world. A second "competitor" to Mos Numena should likely have developed independentally *not* on Hkar, in the milieu of the southerns, or more likely, shouldn't exist. I think it is perfectly reasonable for the world to only have a single archtypeal religion and expect any other pantheonic religion to be more "Greek".

## Northern Realms Cultures

Older version:

>The people who are the descendants of Northerners who were either conquered by Drankor, or ended up strongly influenced by Drankor and intermixing. Generally speaking, this is the broad swath of people who were subjects of the Drankorian Empire and lived north of Chardon. These people were the backbone of the diverse set of small kingdoms and realms that existed in the north pre-Great-War. Their culture was largely Drankorian, with the opportunity for some quirks/oddities/etc as desired. Tend to think of these cultures as kind of broadly Germanic, but also probably a lot of diversity, with some groups tending more towards Mawaran and others more Drankorian, in a broadly north/south gradient. These people suffered greatly in the Great War, as pretty much all the densest population areas of this culture were either destroyed by dragons or conquered and ruled by hobgoblins. In the current day, the more "Drankorian" flavor of this population is the heartland of the Chardonian Empire living on the agricultural coast, and the more "Mawaran" tends to the interior around Lake Valandros and north. These people are generally Mos Numena worshippers. 

The current version removes the idea of a Mawar vs Drankor cultural split as it is not considered canonical.

## Illoria
 Older version:
 
 >The islands of the Nevos Sea were conquered by Drankor and converted to Mos Numena, but never fully integrated into the empire. Illoria has always been a melting pot, and the people of the islands were historically a mix of Northerners and probably some later Hkaran migrants, so even before the downfall this was a blended place. In current day also includes people with Dunmari ancestry, some "northern realms culture" refugees, Drankorian refugees, some of everybody. Probably one of the most religiously diverse places on the mainland. 

%% Illoria seems like a place that could have a cultural descendancy from the "southern" exodus, although probably not a cultural connection. Perhaps Illorian is a unique language that is more related to Southern than anything else? %%
