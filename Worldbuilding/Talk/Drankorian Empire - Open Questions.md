### Drankorian Expansion
How far east does Drankor expand, and when? The areas immediately east of Drankor are poorly categorized. There has been lots of brainstorming in this space, but nothing settled. The only canonical truth is that Drankor cannot expand so far east as to prevent the Dunmari from having an independent homeland somewhere "out East". 

Similarly, there are no clear answers to the question of when Drankor expanded towards the Green Sea coast. Canonically both [[Cymea]] and [[~South Cymea~]] were long term Drankorian provinces, but the exact history of settlement is not clear. Additionally, it is not clear if these areas were mostly empty of people.

The assumption broadly is that the ancient lizardfolk swamp would have stretched across what is southern Cymea, and the elven forests would have stretched to the shores of the Green Sea, thus leaving only the northern part of Cymea to be potentially populated by mariners. Many reasons could exist for this to have been, or have not been, populated.  The only canonical requirement is that Tyrwingha exist (although potentially as a isolated group of humanity amongst a mosty lizardfolk milieu) and that by the [[fall of Drankor]], Cymean at least was strongly Drankorian.

There are also questions about whether or where Drankor and the proto-Dunmari encountered each other. Basically the whole narrative of Drankorian expansion _east_ rather than north or west is very unclear.
