This document tracks some open questions and discussion about the metaphysics of magic in Taelgar.

## Types of Magic

Recent invention has solidified the fundamental metaphysics that make Taelgar different from Earth and hence drive all magic. Specifically, we propose there are two magical forces in the universe:

[[Soulstuff]], which has the following properties:
- It exists throughout the multiverse, and is somehow central to the formation of the planes, in the sense that "Plane of Fire soulstuff" has a different "flavor" than "Feywild soulstuff" or "Limbo soulstuff". 
- It accretes to sentient beings - this is what a Taelgarian soul is, the accretion of soulstuff "flavored" like your native plane
- Beings that accrete lots of soulstuff can fuel innate magical abilities
- Beings that accrete really really large amounts of soulstuff become divinities, capable of granting miracles
- The [[Divine Presence]] is best conceptualized as an unimaginably dense accretion of soulstuff; perhaps not really metaphysically distinct from the [[Plane of Creation]] itself. 
- The [[Land of the Dead]] somehow functions as a barrier to "soulstuff power" - this serves as an in-world explanation for why gods can't just fix all problems, but also likely has important metaphysical implications
- The souls of all sapient beings linger after death in some manner. 
- Some sapient species are gifted soulstuff from beyond the Land of the Dead when they are born; this has important metaphysical considerations. These "gifts" return in some form to the divinity that gifted them after death, although the nature of this "return" is left mysterious and might vary across divinities. Much human religious lore about death involves the process of crossing the Land of the Dead to reach "the beyond" but human speculation about this may be completely wrong. Most ways of returning dead beings to life involve magic that returns the soul from the land of the death (or equivalent); only extremely powerful magic can bring back souls that have passed "beyond" and there is no canonical reason why these souls must be reliable narrators of "the beyond". 

Magic, which has the following properties:
- It comes from the [[Plane of Magic]], which interdigitates with other planes, perhaps in complicated and variable ways
- Use of magic depends on being able to connect to this planar energy
- It is not "flavored" - there is just one kind of magic. There is not a separate "plane of fire" magic or a "abyss" magic. 
- Magic powered by Magic is about shaping this raw energy to create a particular effect

**Note: Important uncollected Discord conversations exist about this**

These two types of magic do not perfectly align with D&D rules about magic. In general, in D&D, there are roughly four classes of "magical things"

(1) Spells, which can be further divided into arcane, divine, or primal
(2) Psionics, which are variously represented in mechanics but have a long history in the game; in recent versions of D&D 5e these tend to be represented by componentless spellcasting
(3) Magical Effects, which is a catch-all for class, species, and creature effects described as magical but not represented by spells
(4) Supernatural Features, which is a catch-all for class, species, and creature effects that seem to violate normal physics but which are not explicitly labeled as magical

Note that 5e is quite disorganized on this point, especially the distinction between 3 and 4

In some older notes, we tend to focus on spell categories, with a lot of discussion around what "primal" magic represents. I think recent invention about soulstuff and magic clarifies some things, and suggestions the following framework + open questions. 

### Basic Rules of Magic - Open Questions

The only fundamental metaphysical rule is that any magical effect ultimately derives from one of three* sources: magical energy from the Plane of Magic, soulstuff from an external source, or your internal well of accreted soulstuff. The only exception is that creatures with Far Realms connections may have access to and use strange, alien types of magic. 

In D&D rules, two additional distinctions matter: 
- The difference between "spells" and "non-spell magical effects" is relevant for Counterspell and Dispel Magic, which only work on spells.
- The difference between "magical effects" and "supernatural effects" is relevant for the Magic Resistance trait of many monsters, and for the Antimagic Field spell. 

D&D mechanics do not have to map to Taelgarian metaphysics, but it should be possible to connect D&D mechanics to in-world metaphysics, primarily for world-building satisfaction, but also potentially to help develop consistent guidelines for mechanical rulings grounded in metaphysics. 

So some proposed general rules and metaphysics:

(1) There is a fundamental distinction between channeling power from an external source, and drawing upon your own internal reservoir of soulstuff. This more or less maps to the old 3e distinction between "magical effects" and "supernatural effects". Generally things like antimagic fields or magic resistance work on externally channeled abilities, but not internal abilities. As a first approximation, this can be translated into D&D rules based on whether the feature is described as magical/uses a spell slot (external), or is not (internal), but see below. 

(2)There is a fundamental distinction between spells, which involve shaping magical energy into some kind of external effect by following a ritualized pattern, and non-spell effects which are generally more nebulous and loose but may still involve channeling external energy. An open question is whether spells have to be channeling external energy, or can you generate spells from your internal soulstuff reservoir?

However, from a character perspective / in-world perspective, there is no reason why ideas like Arcane/Primal/Divine need to map to anything in particular. That said, there are probably a few general ways that magic happens:

- The most common pattern is probably "asking a powerful entity for a miracle". This could be straightforward "prayers for miracles" as, for example, for a traditionally themed cleric or paladin. It could also work for warlocks, who might not be beseeching divinities. This kind of magic would usually be formed of soulstuff, although in some special circumstances it might be logical for a warlock to channel arcane magic via a patron, or even something stranger (e.g. via a Far Realm entity). 
- Another pattern is learning how to channel the arcane energy of the plane of magic, into spells and other magical effects. This is a simple option for wizards, many sorcerers, and other arcane casters, but in principle can work for anybody if desired. 
- The rarest, but most flexible pattern, is to channel soulstuff directly, not mediated through another entity. A druid, for example, could be deeply connected to the Material Plane and learn to channel the ambient soulstuff that makes up the Material Plane into spells and other magical effects. This also works well for certain sorcerous origins, and potentially for rangers, anyone fey-touched, and others. 

*Open Question:* One natural explanation for Psionics would be that this involves using your innate soulstuff, which matches the kind of theme from high school and various later worldbuliding ideas that "psionics" is the magic of the plane of consciousness. This potentially means that spells can be constructed from any source of power, not just external sources of power. Left unclear is whether psionics spells are affected by antimagic field or dispel magic or counterspell in this scenario. 

For any player who wants to get deep into the weeds, it would be possible to come up with the metaphysics of each ability and spell separately, which do not all have to match. But as defaults, I would suggest something like:

- Arcane casters channel the plane of magic. This includes sorcerers, bards, wizards, eldritch knights, arcane tricksters, and artificers
- Divine casters are granted miracles by their deities. This includes clerics and paladins.
- Druids and Rangers typically channel the ambient soulstuff of one or more appropriate planes, which could be the Material Plane for a nature-focused vibe, or something else. 
- Warlocks are granted access to soulstuff from a particular plane via their patron, which they can use to shape magical effects and spells. 
- Other classes typically rely only on their internal wells of soulstuff for magical and supernatural effects. This includes psionic classes (GOO warlock, aberrant mind sorcerer, soulknife rogue, etc).

Ultimately, it is not clear that this would have much impact on D&D games, and I think that figuring out how a character's magic works would always be strictly optional. But from a worldbuilding perspective, I think it is useful to frame things as:
- Asking for miracles is by far the most common kind of magic. Very few people can learn to actively channel either arcane energy or soulstuff themselves; a larger number, though still small, can receive "shaped energy" from elsewhere and express it in the Material Plane. Metaphysically, a typical cleric therefore might know a number of specific prayers that can be used to call upon their deity to produce a number of spells and other magical effects, and might also have a few supernatural effects created by the sense that some of their soulstuff becomes infused with the divine essence or something like that. More rarely, people could use the same mechanic to beseech a different kind of patron for power, though this could be as a willing supplicant, an unnoticed parasite, an unwilling recipient, or something else. For example, a celestial warlock might be metaphysically identical to a cleric, while a fiend warlock might hide their connection to a powerful devil lord, siphoning off some of their vast power without the devil lord even noticing. 
- Next most common is learning to shape arcane energy from the plane of magic. The arcane energy of the plane of magic is everywhere, and it is the easiest extraplanar energy to shape, by far, but this is still considerably more challenging and rarer than receiving power from another entity / asking for miracles.
- Least common is learning to shape planar soulstuff directly, unmediated by a patron or divinity. But this can explain a lot of things. The fey-touched feat, for example, could just be a way to represent a little talent for shaping feywild soulstuff. Sorcerous origins, druids, rangers, and even warlocks can be flavored this way. A fiend warlock, for example, could metaphysically be a human born with a plane-touched soul, with some connection to the Nine Hells, which they learn to channel into spells, without having a patron at all.
