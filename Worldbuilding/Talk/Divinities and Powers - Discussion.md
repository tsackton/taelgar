Discussion and open questions around the concept of Divinities (see: [[Creature Rules in Taelgar]]). 

Note: we might need a better name for this, to avoid confusion. It is a useful metaphysical category for things like archfey, but I think we want to avoid calling these "divinities". Extraplanar powers is currently used for roughly this category, and might work. 

Consider just calling these things Powers (with capital P). Are they necessarily extra-planar? It might be worth distinguishing between:
* Powers - a unique being with a unique creation story that has accumulated enough soulstuff to have transcending traditional mortality. In game terms, the key feature is that these creatures do not have Hit Points
* Deities - a Power that is worshipped by a species and has the potential to gift soulstuff
* Divinity - a Deity that was specifically created by the Divine Presence or the Divine Spark

An alternative might be to say a Divinity is a Power with a locus of existence in the Spiritual Realms. Alternatively, it might be better to classified these entities as simply
* Powers -  (as above)
* Divinities - a Power that has the ability to gift soulstuff

It seems to me the major divisions are, to some extent:
* Creation: Divine Presence/Divine Spark (i.e. Aldanor) vs simply accreting soulstuff (i.e. Ethlenn or Cha'mutte) vs a gift of soulstuff (i.e. Beryl, Bishma)
* Locus: Material Plane vs Inner Plane vs Spiritual Realm
* Whether the Power can interact with worshipers and grant miracles
* Whether the Power can gift soulstuff to species

The latter two questions might be tightly tied up in the metaphysics of the Divine Spark, i.e. is there actually a difference between Beryl and the Father other than power level? It may be that in reality NO human divinity can gift soul stuff, and it all comes from the Divine Presence. That would suggest that the actually the ability to have worshippers and grant miracles might be technically something ANY Power can do (it just depends on their strength). I guess to put it another way: Is the ability to gift soulstuff unique to the Embodied Gods (probably yes)? Is the ability to gain strength from worship unique to the Incorporeal Gods (probably yes)?

That would suggest that broadly, there are three types of Powers:
* Embodied Gods: the Powers that have the unique ability to gift some of their very essence to mortals
* Incorporeal Gods: the Powers that have the unique ability to receive a gift of soulstuff from mortals and use it to grow their own strength
* Everything else

(This ignores the Divine Presence as not categorizable, and in fact perhaps best thought of as just "the mind of soulstuff" or something like that)
