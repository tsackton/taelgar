road from ~Karawa to Chardon. needs a name.

%%notes
The old Drankorian Road that runs east/west, reasonably heavily used between Karawa and Tokra, then on to Songara, but peters out east of Karawa. 

About halfway between Tokra and Karawa, a three-mile segment of an old aqueduct exists still. Drankorian in origin. Faded enchantment that increases water flowing over it, basically a repeater to make up for evaporation over long distance transport.

Seeker built earthen berm to make access easier, so Dunmari can use as a mini-oasis.
