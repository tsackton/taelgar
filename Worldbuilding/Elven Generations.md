Trying to work out elven cycle of generations, as well as the mela and leya phases.

Each ka is a period of 160 years, split into a mela and a leya phase. The children born during the mela phase of a particular ka are associated with that ka. 

Will work on / update exact numbers later.

| ka  | dwarven year | drankorian year | mela start | leya start |
| --- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1   | 0            | NA              | 0          | 80         |
| 2   | 160          |                 | 160        | 240        |
| 3   |              |                 |            |            |
| 4   |              |                 |            |            |
| 5   |              |                 |            |            |
| 6   |              |                 |            |            |
| 7   |              |                 |            |            |
