Some old notes on Tyrwingha of dubious canonicallity. This notes document probably not critical once it is incorporated into the main body.

Tim's notes on Tyrwingha:  
  
* Over time, this alliance (drankor -fey) proved to be quite powerful, something about the fey warlocks of Tyrwingha that I haven't made up yet. Also rumors of fey ancestry among the population, even to the current day.  
* Tyrwingha, more than other parts of the Sembaran area, sees itself explicitly in terms of a blending of two cultures, [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the ancestral Tyrwinghan heritage, and made stronger for it (as opposed to northern highlanders, who probably somewhat resisted Drankorian influence, and Sembaran river valley and southern highlanders, who were forcibly assimilated in a much more direct way), but in the modern day (post Great War), this identity is really uniquely Tyrwinghan, and the Drankorian connection is, if not exactly forgotten, not common knowled

riffing on what you said above, what about something like this: In the ancient times, Ethlenn's earls were effectively her court in the mortal realm, and it would have been common for them to spend some time in the Feywild. The idea of earls having circuits of villages, and villages owning service to Ethlenn via the earls would date to this time. When Ethlenn made her deal with Drankor, part of the deal was specifically to create the Oracle of the Riven, which in turn had veto power over the Drankorian governer of the province. The Oracle was also the vehicle by which Ethlenn learned magical secrets from Drankor. Over the many years of Drankorian rule, Ethlenn fades a little bit into the background, and the earls intermix with the Drankorian elite and start to acquire land and more mudane interests. The ideal of the earls as Ethlenn's knights-errant doesn't vanish, but it is less and less likely a specific earl lives up to that ideal. The Drankorian provincial governer has little power over the countryside, but does become something of a powerful figure in Tafolvern (and perhaps, the entire city is only founded in the Drankrorian era) (edited)

The earls also start to spend less / no time in the Feywild, replacing it with time in Tafolvern, where the governer is based, and the governer grows into a position that resolves disputes amongst the earls

The Oracle of the Riven becomes the focus on Ethlenn's interest, esp because of the magical aspect

When Drankor falls, and danger comes, the position of monarch develops initially as effectively the Oracle's appointed army commander. The warlock cadres date from the time just after Drankor falls, when Tyrwingha has to look to its own defense, and the core of what later becomes the Army of Mostreve dates from this time as well

Over the years, the balance of power generally develops as:
- The monarch is the commander in chief of the army, and is responsible for the safety of the borders of Tyrwingha, and for foreign relations, and acts as a spokesperson for the Oracle of the Riven.
    - In the tradition of the Drankoria governer, the monarch is also the one who is empowered to resolve disputes between the earls.
    
    But the monarch has little say in the actual governance of the country
    
    Derik III originally accepts the Tyrwinghan crown basically because he wants to be the commander in chief of an army of warlocks
    
    His heirs are given the Tyrwinghan crown because Ethlenn/the Oracle of the Riven wants Sembara to be responsible for the defense of the borders of Tyrwinghan - safety in numbers, basically


Some notes from an email to my players:
Jut shrines feels like the wrong word for these kinds of places, as folks don't really pray to the fey. There is probably a mixture of appeasement, caretaking, and duty in the normal Tyrwinghan's relationship with the fey....

  

appeasement, because of course the fey are powerful and tricky and you don't want them on your bad side

caretaking, because these are also Ethleen's subjects, even if they are somewhat mysterious ones, and part of the culture of Tyrwingha is a loving connection to Ethleen. So some Tyrwinghans might feel quite possessive of their local fey and quite inclined to see themselves as the supporters/providers for the fey

duty, because again, Ethleen, and even if you don't love the fey personally, or find there mystery/mischivery a bit distasteful, it is still a Tyrwinghan's duty to look out for all of Ethleen's subjects  

* The monarch of Tyrwingha is elected by the Oracles of the Riven, a group of six powerful and somewhat mysterious figures, usually warlocks. It is said that when an Oracle dies, Ethleen appoints their successor, although whether this is true or not, Celyn doesn't know. It would certainly be plausible to believe it, or not, or be somewhat unsure -- Tyrwinghans are all three. But it is undisputed historical fact that Ethleen has appointed _some_ of the historical Oracles, especially in the period around the Great War about 150 years ago. There is also a longstanding understanding in Tyrwingha that anyone may 

  Remember, the basic temple hierarchy of Mos Numena (the religion of the Eight Divines***) has two parts: the administrators and managers of the temple, called temple stewards, are not necessarily particularly well connected to the gods, and are usually employed by the town, city, village, etc to provide upkeep, social organizing, event planning, etc. Then there are the priests, who have very little hierarchy and are pretty disorganized, but who are the ones with real connections to the gods. Some small villages could easily have both a temple steward and a priest, but it's somewhat random -- priests are not members of some kind of large hierarchy and are assigned out, it is all more personal than that.

  In both Tyrwingha and Sembara, each divine is worshipped separately, and temples are always to a specific divine. In Sembara though, they have this odd tradition of asking "their" god to talk to the other gods, whereas in Tyrwingha although each shrine or temple is dedicated to a single god, many people worship many different gods. So in Clawyn there is probably just one temple (to the Wyrdling, I guess). But in a larger town in Tyrwingha there would be multiple temples, and even in Clawyn Celyn's neighbor the midwife had a small altar to the Mother in her garden, and the village cemetery a small shrine to the Night Queen. One of the weirder things about Cleenseau is that they all seem to worship the Warlord and they ask him to talk to all the other gods. So even during Vitalae, which is dedicated to the Wanderer, you'd here all of these Sembarans say things like, "Warlord, please tell the Wanderer I am in need of charity this night.." or whatever.

  There is a longstanding story in Tyrwingha that there is a place in Ethleen's court for any Tyrwinghan who desires to renounce the human realm and come live in the Feywild. This is said to have been part of her condition for allowing Drankor (the ancient empire, long gone, vague Roman analog) to rule the land.

From some background emails

Kiya's exploration of Celyn's background has inspired me to flesh out a few background details of Tyrwingha that I'd thought I'd share with the two Tyrwinghans.

  

Tyrwinghan society is organized around two main pillars: 

* at the bottom, the village. 

* at the top, the earls

  

**Earls**

In ancient days, the title of Earl was said to be bestowed on Ethlenn's knights, those who had sworn a direct oath to her to serve and obey, and were thus seen as her stewards in the human realm, her knight-errants. Today, these earls, of which there are about thirty, are powerful lords, whose bond to Ethlenn derives from their allegiance to the monarch. The earls have a duty to watch over the land on behalf of Ethlenn, and usually they spend at least six months of the year travelling with their retainers and court. 

  
Each earl has a circuit, which they ride, and a set of villages and towns on that circuit, for which they are responsible. The earl is obligated to provide, to their villages and towns, justice, defense, and charity. The villages are obligated to provide to the Ethlenn, via the earl, labor service. This labor service is traditionally a year of labor for every ten hearths in the village. This can take many forms: in some cases, it is someone joining the earl's travelling court, or the Army of Mostreve. In other cases, it is working the earl's land, in which it is more usually divided up, i.e. six people working the land during harvest and planting, rather than one person for a whole year.  
  
The earl, in turn, is responsible for providing to each village:  
* Justice, in the form of appeals from the village Court of All (see below)  
* Defense, via their own force of arms, and their retainers  
* Charity, in the form of support in hard times, managing the redistribution of food and so on  

  

Today earls are somewhat more political than in the past, but it is not unheard of for an earl to spend time in the Feywild even now (although spending the time that they are not riding circuit with their court in the capital, Tafolwern, is much more common.   

  

**Villages**

Villages, which tend to be small - maybe 100 to 300 people, most often, sometimes more like 500 or at most 1000 - are self-organized via what is called the Court of All, which is an assembly of all of the households in the village. Each house with a hearth is entitled to send one representative, and those houses with multiple hearths can send multiple representatives. The Court of All is responsible for much of life in the village, including judging and punishing crimes,  settling property disputes, and making decisions about how the village will satisfy its labor obligations. Property sales within the village must also be approved by the Court of All, and it is responsible for keeping records of land ownership. Think of it as something a bit like a New England town meeting. The Court of All is also responsible for ensuring the local temple or temples are funded and the festivals celebrated, and for ensuring that the village is a good neighbor to whichever fairies might live locally, be visiting. This also means that various villages can sometimes have quite different attitudes, as for example one village might be very insular and unwilling to accept newcomers, whereas another town may be more open to them. Each of these villages could enforce their desire, i.e. by controlling property sales.

  

More later...

SOME BACKGROUND FROM A EMAIL TO MY PLAYERS, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SEMI-CANONICAL but in some cases has been superceded
Here is some background on Tyrwingha that might be interesting...

  

The land of Tyrwingha, nestled on the southern shores of the Green Sea, is ruled by the King of Sembara (Robert I) in a personal union of crowns. Although they share a monarch, Tyrwingha and Sembara see themselves as distinct monarchies with unique histories and cultures.

  

It is a land of few large cities beyond the capital, Tafolwern, but is a land rich in magic and tradition. The Archfey Ethlenn, the Queen of the Evening Mist, is said to have been watching over Tyrwingha since time immemorial, and the Tyrwinghans see themselves as the inheritors of an ancient and sacred tradition.

  

Bordered by the Green Sea in the north and the Mostreve Hills in the south, it is an agriculturally fertile land and thrives on rich harvests of wheat and wine, as well as timber from the northern slopes of the Mostreve Hills. Although not a backwater exactly, it is economically somewhat isolated (having no major ports) from the main trade routes of Greater Sembara, and mostly lives and dies with the harvest.

  

Politically, it is a monarchy, although the monarch is formally elected by the Oracles of the Riven (or as they are more prosaically known, the royal electors). There are six of these royal electors (with the titles of the Oracle of the Red, the Oracle of the Black, the Oracle of the White, the Oracle of the Green, the Oracle of the Fallen, and the Unseen Oracle). Ethlenn is said to be the seventh elector, although of course it is rare for her to actually cast a vote. Traditionally, the Oracles are warlocks, and appointed by Ethlenn herself, although like Ethlenn's vote, this tradition is not always observed in the modern day. More usually the oracles select a new member themselves, and Ethlenn's silence is considered assent.

  

Second in importance to the oracles are the earls, high lords of the realm. Today, the title has been exported to Sembara and has lost its traditional meaning -- a noble who had pledged loyalty to Ethlenn in her court. Nonetheless the earls are powerful lords in Sembara, and often control significant landholdings, although freeholds are also more common here than elsewhere in Greater Sembara, and small, independent villages without a lord are not so rare. 

  

The Army of Mostreve is another major part of Tyrwingha, led by the fearsome eldritch knights and an elite cadre of warlocks (arcane magic is more common here than anywhere else in Greater Sembara to a significant degree). The Army was organized by Derik I (see below) after his victories over the Dominion of Avatus, and it today provides a significant route of social mobility. Three major garrisons dot the Mostreve Hills - the garrison of the Aben, in the headwaters of the Aben River, the garrison of Cyfarthfa closest to the capital, and the garrison of Deganwy on the borders of Addermarch. The Aben garrison sees action most years, and is a gathering spot for the Rangers.

  

Religiously, little is remembered about the ancient gods of Tyrwingha, such as they were. The Eight Divines are worshipped here much as they are elsewhere in Sembara. It is said that when Ethlenn made her bargain with the Drankorians (see below), she acknowledged the suzerainty of the Drankorian gods. However, the fey are remembered and honored alongside the gods -- the people of Tyrwingha have a deep respect for the traditions of the fey and what others might call superstition is here seen as simple common sense. The temple stewards in Tyrwingha often have a second job, ensuring the fairy rings are not distributed, leaving out milk and brown bread for the pixies, and other such things (Kiya, this is an area where I'd love some ideas from you about what little rituals would honor the fey folk alongside the gods).

  

Tyrwingha also sees itself as the savior of Sembara, and many times in history this small land in the corner of the map has saved the monarch of Sembara. A few tales help give the flavor:

  

_The Conquest of Drankor_

A thousand years ago or more, the Drankorian Empire was mighty and spanned the whole world it is said. The legions of Drankor were unstoppable, the mages able to unleash the elements at a whim. And yet, it is said, when they marched over the Mostreve Hills to Tyrwingha, they halted, quaking. For the land as they looked out from camps and fortifications was covered with swirling clouds and mists. And they could see, in the heart of each whispy cloud, a clenched fist with the citadel of the city of Drankor grasped within it. The greatest wizards of the time refused to march farther, and the legions threw down their arms, for they feared the might of the Archfey Ethlenn. And yet, it is said, Ethlenn greatly desired the knowledge of magical secrets the Drankorians held. And so a bargain was struck: The Archfey would acknowledge the Drankorians as rulers of the land, and welcome their gods to her domain, in exchange for tribute in the form of secret knowledge. Any Tyrwinghans who did not want to live under Drankorian rule would be allowed to depart for the Feywild, to live in the court of the Archfey. Whether this story is true or not, only the gods and good folk know, but even now, tradition in Tyrwingha holds that all subjects of the Tyrwinghan crown may choose to invoke their right to leave, trading their oaths of loyalty to the Tyrwinghan throne for a life in the court of the Archfey. However, Ethlenn herself has not been seen or heard for generations, and few but the desparate or fey-touched choose this gamble now.

  

  

_The Unification of the Crowns_

  

More recently, the tale of the unification of the crowns of Sembara and Tyrwingha is told thus:

  

Two hundred and forty years ago, the End Times were said to be near. Prophets throughout Tyrwingha were preaching of the world ending, and whole villages were found to have disappeared. Whether fled to the safety of the Feywild, or consumed by darkness, few could answer. Atavus, a military dictator, was ravaging the land with a force of hobgoblins and vicious werewolves, and the Sembarans were ineffective against him. Despite the pleas of the Sembaran dukes, no help came from Tyrwingha -- the Queen herself commanded her knights to stay within the Tyrwinghan borders, for she was wracked by terrible dreams of the downfall of her domain if she entered the war. And so the Sembaran army, defeated on the field, retreated with half its force to winter north of the mighty Wistel River, and Atavus paused to consolidate his gains, and prepared to strike at the heart of Sembara.

   
Into this moment rode Derik I, a distant relative of the king of Sembara, but far from the kingship himself. He had married the second daughter of the Duchess of Telham, on the Northlands coast, and had made a name for himself as a military commander in a series of skirmishes against pirates, in alliance with Tollen mercenaries and halflings.  
  
In the months following the advance of Atavus to the Wistel, a lizardfolk elder had approached Derik, and told him of an omen: he was prophesied to raise a mighty Sembara to form a pillar of strength in the dark times to come, and if he did not overthrow Avatus, the smallest cloud in the coming storm, the darkest shadows of today would seem like the brightest diamonds of tomorrow. But it was also foretold, this elder said, that only the Princess of the Mist could herald his coming.  
  
With the blessing of his mother-in-law, Derik sent a small tithe of the knights of the Duchy of Telham south to aid their ally, the King, and then he sailed with the bulk of the duchy’s forces to Tyrwingha.   
  
When Derik arrived in Tyrwingha, he immediately disembarked and spoke with the queen. It is said that as he set foot on Tyrwinghan shores, the morning fog parted, and turned golden where he stepped, leaving a trail of sparklingly mist behind him. Crowds began to follow, and when he reached the castle, the people of Tyrwingha were watching as he bowed his head humbly to ask to speak with the queen, and Archfey Ethlenn herself appeared before him, and proclaimed that he would be the savior of Tyrwingha, and kissed him on the forehead, passing him her blessing.  
  
As news spread like wildfire of a knight from the north who had been blessed by Ethlenn herself, Derik was quickly proclaimed Derik I, King of Tyrwingha by the Oracles of the Riven, with Ethlenn casting the first vote, in an unusual break from tradition. Derik gathered an army of lizardfolk, the knights of Telham and Tyrwingha, the fey-touched warlocks of the Ethlenn, and Tollen and Vostok mercenaries, and won a decisive victory. 

  

Cloaked in glory and honor and fey-enhanced charisma, Derik forged modern Sembara at the Treaty of Wisford, signed that fall, which established the Royal Council, codified the independence of lizardfolk in the realm forevermore, and cemented the House of Sewick as the rulers of the Joined Crowns of Sembara, Tyrwingha, and Telham.    

  

There is a third story I'm still writing up about the second unification of the crowns (in more recent history, the crowns of Sembara and Tyrwingha were disunited and then reunited again)


Some other notes from Tim:
* I think one reason the country probably feels isolated is that, unlike much of the rest of the Western Gulf, there are not great ports. Tafolwern is on the coast, sort of, but much of the lowlands are marshy and hard to navigate.
* For flavor, remember also a significant lizardfolk community sits just to the east - there is probably a good amount of trade with the lizardfolk and the Tyrwinghans are probably among the most likely to speak lizardfolk of any in Greater Sembara.
