Do you think that there are more fey (i.e. dryads, satyrs, etc) living on Taelgar in Tyrwingha than other places? Or do you think its more one way, i.e. there are a lot of portals, but mostly that means humans -> feywild more than fey -> Tyrwingha?


[3/15/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't really thought about it. but probably yes

going way back to my first campaign with Isaac and Nathaniel I had this idea of kind of a "fey belt" from the darkwood through the tywinghan border to the lizardfolk swamp


[3/15/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I had made up a bunch of like ancient standing circles marking fey crossings and things


[3/15/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
does not need to be canon but kind of fits I think with how the area has developed more recently, and with all the ethlenn lore


[3/15/2024 7:38 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a major status tag update. i've reviewed all the "completed" pages (except people), and IMO all are accurately assigned to the correct status (that is, complete)


[3/15/2024 7:41 PM] rsulfuratus
the "status/unknown" ones are a bit more daunting, as there are ~750 of them, but many are in campaign directories where status tags aren't really useful

I'm pushing a change that removes Zovka, but you should delete it from the map when you get a chance


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed an update to Tyrwingha... would be interested in your opinoin. Also here:

Tyrwingha is a rural place, with no cities of any size outside of [[Tafolwern]], and most people live in small villages and market towns of between 50 and 1000 people. 

Unlike in [[Sembara]], where themanor  is the main unit of political organization, Tyrwingha is fundamentally organized, from the bottom, around the village, and from the top, around the earls. 

In ancient days, the title of Earl was said to be bestowed only on those human lords who had sworn a direct oath to [[Archfey Ethlenn]] to serve and obey her, and were thus seen as her stewards in the human realms, watching over the land and its inhabitants on her behalf. Today, these earls, of which there are about fifty, are powerful lords, whose bond to Ethlenn derives from their allegiance to the monarch. The earls have a duty to watch over the land on behalf of Ethlenn, and usually they spend at least six months of the year travelling with their retainers and court.


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Each earl has a circuit, which they ride, and a set of villages and towns on that circuit, for which they are responsible. The earl is obligated to provide, to their villages and towns, justice, defense, and charity. The villages are obligated to provide to the earl, labor service. This labor service is traditionally a year of labor for every ten hearths in the village. This can take many forms: in some cases, it is someone joining the earl's travelling court, or the Army of Mostreve. In other cases, it is working the earl's land, in which it is more usually divided up, i.e. six people working the land during harvest and planting, rather than one person for a whole year.

The earl, in turn, is responsible for providing to each village:
* Justice, in the form of appeals from the village Court of All (see below)
* Defense, via their own force of arms, and their retainers
* Charity, in the form of support in hard times, managing the redistribution of food and so on


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Villages are usually self-organized, and the Sembaran model of a manoral lord who oversees the village is not typically seen in Tyrwingha (although a small number of Sembaran style manors do exist along the Aure and the border with Sembara).

Village organization is varied, but all villages manage disputes via the Court of All. This is a village gathering that is empowered to judge and punish crimes, settle disputes between neighbors, and make decisions about how the village will fulfil its labor service to Ethlenn and the earl's.

The Court of All is consisted as an assembly of the village, with one representative for each hearth. So the very poor have no representation, and the wealthy somewhat disproportionate representation, but in many villages there are neither wealthy nor poor, and the general vibe is usually fairly democratic.


[3/17/2024 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
was away from my computer all afternoon yesterday, looking at this now


[3/17/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
I would make a few subtle tweaks. 

I think that the fundamental relationship with Ethlenn is less about land (e.g., I'm not sure it makes sense to say that all land in Tyrwingha is held in trust for Ethlenn), and more about obligations of service and protection. 

I like the way you've set up earls, but I'd frame it more explicitly like almost a fey bargain. Ethlenn has offerred her protection over the land, and in turn asks for service from the people.

I kind of imagine that long ago, before Drankor, this was more explicitly about a bargain between the people and Ethlenn, and the service might often involve someone spending a year in the feywild. 

Subsequently, this has evolved, and the earls kind of function like a stand-in. 

I think this is the vibe you were going for, yes?

But the land holding stuff doesn't really fit to me, since it would be weird for a fey lord to have an interest in *land* on the material plane, imo.


[3/17/2024 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense. It is the vibe I was going for.


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
But I also wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to pull in the full complexity of sembaran land holdings. In particular I like the distinction of not being so based around manors, and being more based on service obligations than taxes on land


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
But I agree the ‚ÄúEthlenn owns the land‚Äù is probably the wrong vibe


[3/17/2024 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
I think I would just basically make all land in Tyrwinghan effectively what Sembarans would call folkland


[3/17/2024 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
except that since there is no taxation on land, there is no reason you can't sell it


[3/17/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
the Court of All in a village is responsible for, among other things, land records and deeds, and so you get a bit of a New England town hall vibe where the village can block a sale they don't want, which tends to make villages a bit insular I guess


[3/17/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
I like that actually though


[3/17/2024 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think it works. so basically you have the following:
- a somewhat feudal relationship with Ethlenn, which is based on obligations of service and protection, although practically speaking the earls serve as a stand in for Ethlenn, and claim the service obligations and provide protection (although, there are probably cases in Tywinghan common law where an earl was unable to get the service from a particular village some year because they had instead done something directly for Ethlenn; there might be some tie in with the army and warlocks here)
- a fairly "modern" concept of private property rights
- a heavily rural, village based society where the Court of All controls a lot of aspects of life in a village, with kind of a New England town hall vibe, which probably means there can be a lot of village-to-village variability


[3/17/2024 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus
Left unsaid are how earls are chosen. Are these hereditary nobility now? I guess yes, although perhaps would be worth considering some variants


[3/17/2024 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
My thinking is that technically, like the electors, the earls are supposed to be put forward by the existing body of earls and accepted by Ethlenn


[3/17/2024 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
But in practice, silence is interpreted as acceptance and so mostly children follow parents.  But it‚Äôs formally an elected position where the existing earls are the electors


[3/17/2024 10:36 AM] .deciusmus
So there is some variability especially when an earl dies unexpectedly, ie before having had a chance to have their heir officially selected


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
(The idea being that ‚Äúearls heir‚Äù is a position in its own right, and most earls will arrange for their chosen heir to be elected as the earl-in-waiting before they die)


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think that works


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
But occasionally Ethlenn actually does intervene, and other times politics intervenes, so it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúby right‚Äù that the position inherits like it is in sembara


[3/17/2024 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
What is relationship between earls and the crown?


[3/17/2024 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm‚Ä¶ I think the earls should be subservient to the crown but kinda forgot about the crown in the above


[3/17/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
One possible history could be that originally (pre-Drankor), you just had earls, no crown. The earls were basically Ethenn‚Äôs court on the material plane


[3/17/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
Then in the deal with Drankor, ethenn creates the royal electors, at this point the advisors to drankor or whatever who have to formally approve whoever is proposed for governor of the province


[3/17/2024 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
The earls still exist and are fairly independent of the Drankorian hierarchy


[3/17/2024 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
Part of the deal, perhaps, is that certain matter of local organization are devolved to the earls still


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Maybe in the early days post Drankor the monarch is actually quite weak, and the power of the monarch kind of depends on the extent to which the monarch is seen as the actual representative of Ethlenn on the material plane


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Formally speaking the monarch is always supposed to be that


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
So earls would owe allegiance kind of analogously to a reagent


[3/17/2024 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
I like that so far‚Ä¶


[3/17/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
could even imagine that the early tales of the earls of Tyrwingha have a bit of a "knights of the round table" vibe, with Ethlenn as the king arthur standin. Maybe "earl" is actually an old Tyrwinghan word for knight

[3/17/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
I think this would imply that the earls are kind of an independent power base; it is only the assumption/belief that Ethlenn will directly intervene to keep things from going too far off the rails that keeps things working, since in some sense the earls don't actually owe any formal allegience to the monarch themsevles. they owe allegience to Ethlenn, and thus to the monarch as Ethlenn's mortal representative


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
I do think the electors should have more power/something here. The oracle of the riven is envisioned as 7 high level warlocks.


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the third pillar I'd add is that probably the Oracles of the Riven and the elite warlock cadre in the army should have some connection and perhaps more active power than is described


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
ha yes


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
jinx


[3/17/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
It is also interesting the relationship with sembara


[3/17/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the Tyrwinghan monarchy is quite weak, and all the times it doubles up with sembara works relatively well because basically the monarch focuses on sembara


[3/17/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
right, I can sort of envision that in times of peace, or in times of dire war, Tyrwingha gets a lot out of a close personal alliance with Sembara, and doesn't give up much, since functionally speaking it doesn't really make any different to the people of Clawyn or wherever who the warlocks say the mortal representative of Ethlenn is


[3/17/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
the real question is what does Ethlenn get out of it?


[3/17/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
and also what does Sembara get out of it?


[3/17/2024 11:01 AM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm getting in the car to go grocery shopping but I will ponder

[3/17/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
So riffing on what you said above, what about something like this:

In the ancient times, Ethlenn's earls were effectively her court in the mortal realm, and it would have been common for them to spend some time in the Feywild.  The idea of earls having circuits of villages, and villages owning service to Ethlenn via the earls would date to this time.

When Ethlenn made her deal with Drankor, part of the deal was specifically to create the Oracle of the Riven, which in turn had veto power over the Drankorian governer of the province. The Oracle was also the vehicle by which Ethlenn learned magical secrets from Drankor.

Over the many years of Drankorian rule, Ethlenn fades a little bit into the background, and the earls intermix with the Drankorian elite and start to acquire land and more mudane interests. The ideal of the earls as Ethlenn's knights-errant doesn't vanish, but it is less and less likely a specific earl lives up to that ideal. 

The Drankorian provincial governer has little power over the countryside, but does become something of a powerful figure in Tafolvern (and perhaps, the entire city is only founded in the Drankrorian era)


[3/17/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
The earls also start to spend less / no time in the Feywild, replacing it with time in Tafolvern, where the governer is based, and the governer grows into a position that resolves disputes amongst the earls


[3/17/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
The Oracle of the Riven becomes the focus on Ethlenn's interest, esp because of the magical aspect


[3/17/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
When Drankor falls, and danger comes, the position of monarch develops initially as effectively the Oracle's appointed army commander. The warlock cadres date from the time just after Drankor falls, when Tyrwingha has to look to its own defense, and the core of what later becomes the Army of Mostreve dates from this time as well


[3/17/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Over the years, the balance of power generally develops as:

* The monarch is the commander in chief of the army, and is responsible for the safety of the borders of Tyrwingha, and for foreign relations, and acts as a spokesperson for the Oracle of the Riven. 
* In the tradition of the Drankoria governer, the monarch is also the one who is empowered to resolve disputes between the earls. 

But the monarch has little say in the actual governance of the country


[3/17/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Derik III originally accepts the Tyrwinghan crown basically because he wants to be the commander in chief of an army of warlocks


[3/17/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
His heirs are given the Tyrwinghan crown because Ethlenn/the Oracle of the Riven wants Sembara to be responsible for the defense of the borders of Tyrwinghan - safety in numbers, basically


[3/17/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that works quite well


[3/17/2024 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
And actually the post-Great War history of Sembaran and Tyrwinghan kings works perfectly for the idea that the Oracle is effectively being told by Ethlenn when to align with Sembara (because of say, upcoming hobgoblin wars) vs when not to (because the Sembaran king is going to be weak)


[3/17/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I think in modern Tyrwingha, the Oracle is the ultimate authority and are the ones who are still perceied as Ethlenn's advisors. The monarch's authority comes from the Oracle's support.

The Oracle of the Riven maybe is also responsible for selecting earls. That is, it isn't the whole group of earl's who pick new ones, it is also the Oracle


[3/17/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
So you have this shadowy, clearly fey aligned group that is widely still seen to speak for Ethlenn, picking both the monarch and the earls


[3/17/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually kind of like the earls being elected by their peers, as opposed to the Oracle. I think it sets up more interesting political possibilities than if it is just a shadowy council that controls everything


[3/17/2024 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I can see that


[3/17/2024 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the monarch as commander of the army provides a pretty significant check on the ability of the earls to become too independently powerful - and since the core strength of the Tywinghan army is a cadre of warlocks personally obligated to Ethlenn they can't be made to act against Ethlenn's interests


[3/17/2024 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
this also provides incentive for Sembara to invest in a personal union of the crowd. as Sembara is fairly weak in magic


[3/17/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but also explains why it is always just a personal union of the crowns, and Tyrwingha despite a long history is never incorporated into Sembara directly


[3/17/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
it would probably be good to have some rumors or lore about what the people of Tyrwingha think about Ethlenn's motives, although I think it is probably better to leave the truth unclear


[3/17/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe your player who is writing the 5000 word backstory can come up with some theories about what Ethlenn gets out of all of this


[3/17/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that‚Äôs a good idea. I‚Äôll ask her what she thinks
