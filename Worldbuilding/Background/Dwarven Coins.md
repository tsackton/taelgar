Dwarven  coins from discord:

only think semi-canonical is dwarven trade bars are stamped and marked to indicate a certain weight of gold or silver in standard sizes and are typically trusted/commonly used for large transactions

From Clee:

Occasionally used in treasure hordes as "common trade coins"

From old, non-canon Dunmar notes:
Dwarven coins are in common usage in Dunmar as well, especially iron trading coins, known as nibs, that are backed by a gold standard but not otherwise containing any intrinsic worth. Nibs in 5 sp, 1 gp, 10 gp, and 50 gp are known. Dwarven trade bars, stamped with a known weight of silver or gold, are commonly used for large transactions in Dunmar as well.
