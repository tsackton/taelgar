This is a background document I am planning to use to produce more game-relevant and PC-focused material around the history of Cleenseau.

### Before Drankor
The town of [[Cleenseau]] is chiefly famous for an enormous stone bridge crossing the [[Enst]]. This bridge is wide enough for 4 carts and runs straight and smooth and high over the river, and even in the worst storms and floods it has never been damaged.

Some ideas about its origin:
* It was created by giants for mysterious reasons in the aftermath of the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]
* It was created by Drankorian mages to assist the conquest of Sembara and/or the [[Highland Conquest Wars]]
* It is a projection or echo of some other realm, i.e. the Plane of Earth

In game, the rumor of giants has been mentioned. 

### Drankorian Period
There was a Drankorian town on this site, originally founded as a frontier garrison (perhaps because the bridge was there) in DR 360. The Drankorian town presumably thrived and had an interesting history, but that is largely irrelevant now.

However a ruined stone tower on the south bank of the [[Enst]] dates to the late 300s when this was a large supply depot and bustling Drankorian garrison during the conquest of Sembara.

This tower was built with powerful protective magic, and it was only in the 1420s when Avatus sacked the town that the protective magic was broken and the tower fell.

### The Dark Ages and Early Sembara
After the [[The First Plague|First Plague]] the entire area was in upheaval. Cleenseau was far enough north that it wasn't consumed in the actual destruction of the Empire, but there must have been many disruptions.

The halfling community, if you could question them, would tell you that during this time they started wintering here, sometimes, as the bridge was a convenient crossing spot over the river, and that although the main human town, such as it was, on was on the south bank, the halflings had a small seasonal settlement on the north bank. This was the first even semi-permanent settlement here, and [[Marigold Stonebridge]], might, if the mood struck her, claim that [[The Crossroads Inn]] was built on the site of this ancient halfling settlement. The Stonebridges have certainly been in this area for time immemorial, and Marigold has a deed dated DR 1332 from a Lord Tanrreck (a vassal of the Duke of Wisford) indicating the Stonebridge ownership of the several acres of land by "ancient family right".

## The Great War and Blood Years
During the war with [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] Cleenseau is sacked and burned to the ground. The bridge is undamaged, and there is some fighting back and forth but the land is largely abandoned.  A small halfling community flees Avatus but returns quickly and the current Crossroads Inn dates to this time. 

During the later 1450s the town is resettled as trade between Isingue and Sembara grows, although it is a peaceful place and no garrison or walls are built. The Great War does not reach this far north, and for the most part Cleenseau is untouched, save for the men and women who live to fight and die and never return.  However, in 1546, as the hobgoblin threat in the south grows, [[Derik III]] establishes the first military garrison here and some substantial fortifications are built a bit to the east of the Crossroads Inn.

This garrison is substantially increased in the 1550s during and after the Blood Plague, as Cleenseau becomes more of a border town and the road south to Maseau becomes more dangerous. Town walls are built, although smaller than the current walls (and the Crossroads Inn is outside them). 

## The Hobgoblin Wars

The First Hobgoblin War is largely fought to the north of Cleenseau, and some of its garrison is pulled into the fighting. Little is remembered from that time but as Cleenseau was a very military town with a large garrison, many people would have lost relatives. 

The Second Hobgoblin War is fought just south of the Enst, and Cleenseau was a major garrison and logistics point for the armies fighting to the south, as the only safe river crossing for many miles. The Sembaran general, as the battles were going badly, even tried to destory the bridge to protect Sembara but it was undestrucible. Maybe this cursed the garrison for some period of time.

After [[Treaty of Ch√¢teauclair]] in 1602, the Second Hobgoblin War ends and the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] is established just south of Cleenseau, and trade largly ceases. The walls are strengthened, taking many stones from the (at the time) somewhat intact Drankorian fort on the south bank of the Enst. The next 40 years, until the Third Hobgoblin War starts in 1644, are tense and highly fortified.

In spring DR 1647, during the darkest period of the Third Hobgoblin War, Cleenseau is sacked and conqueored by the hobgoblins. The entire population is put to death, and the hobgoblins massively fortify it as a "beachhead" on the north side of the Enst from which many raids are launched. In particular, the build a hillfort on top of the old Sembaran garrison, and a wall that incorporates the Crossroads Inn, which is used as a headquarters and feasting hall. The entire area around Cleenseau is depopulated as either hobgoblin raids kill people or they flee to safer places.

In the spring of DR 1649, Cece reconqueors the town and it is a large staging spot for military campaigns to the south, but no population returns. In DR 1651 Cece gives the lordship of Cleenseau to one of her young army captains, [[Reginald Essford]] in honor of his heroic service, and he builds [[Essford Manor]] on the ruins of the hobgoblin fortifications. 

The Stonebridges return, and the Crossroads Inn (still standing, having been used as a hobgoblin headquarters) is cleansed and returned to service as an inn.

Over the 1650s the wall is rebuild, and the garrison reestablished, and the [[Reginald Essford]] manages the place well and Cleenseau thrives, and grows.
