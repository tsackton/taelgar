Use this folder for world building information that is considered canonical, but that doesn't make sense in the main tree.

This is typically information that should be referenced as part of creation else, i.e. information about hobgoblin movements after the Great War or human migrations from Hkar, where the exact details are not created/canonical but the sweep of history impacts are.
