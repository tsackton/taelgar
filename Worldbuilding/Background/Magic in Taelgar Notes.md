Starting a brainstorming doc to codify some notes on magic in Taelgar. 
## A Few Basic Truths

Starting with a few basic observations about the world that should be maintained. 

1. Most magic comes from the various gods and divinities of Taelgar. This is by far the easiest magic to learn, the most common magic, and the most reliable magic. 
	1. For humans, this means that divine magic users are far more common than arcane or primal magic users among the population
	2. For Firstborn races, this means that whatever manifestations of magic that their Embodied Gods provide are far more common than anything else.
2. Arcane magic comes from learning to manipulate extraplanar energy, which leaks into Taelgar as an aftereffect of the Riving. This has relatively little implications for spellcasting, but is an important lore fact.
3. Primal magic comes from the resonances among the echo realms in the world of Taelgar. What exactly this means is not clearly defined in world lore yet, but the vague implication is that it somehow the magic of the material plane. 
4. The ability to use magic is much more common, for whatever reason, among individuals driven to adventure, as heroes or villains, than among those who settle. This does not currently have any satisfying in-game explanation, but is necessary to allow satisfying high-level adventures to exist with humanoid allies and enemies.
## How Common is Magic?

Considering general spellcasting ability, common magic items, rare magic items, and high level spells separately. 

### General Spellcasting Ability

A good rule of thumb is that roughly 1 in 1000 people has some kind of magical talent. This suggests that generally a spellcaster is available in most larger market towns, but only 1 in 10 or even 1 in 20 small villages will have a spellcaster. Most people will probably know a spellcaster second or third-hand; almost everyone would at least know someone who has seen magic performed. 

In standard human populations, a safe assumption would be that 50%-60% of spellcasters are divine magic users, mostly clerics, although there is presumably some regional variation, and arcane spellcasters in particular may be likely to aggregate in much higher density around major centers of learning. Non-divine spellcasters are likely roughly equally divided between primal and arcane casters. 

In a typical heavily settled agricultural region with about 10,000 people scattered between a market town and numerous small villages, one might expect to find 5-6 divine magic users (mostly/entirely clerics), 2-3 arcane magic users (mostly wizards or bards), and 2-3 primal magic users (druids or rangers).

### Spell Levels

Among the magic-using, non-adventuring population, only about 20%-30% of spellcasters ever learn, or are even capable of learning, to cast anything more powerful than a 1st level spell, and generally less than 5% of non-adventuring spellcasters ever achieve the power to cast 3rd level or higher spells. 

This implies that even in a large city of 100,000 people, there are probably only 4-6 people who can cast 3rd level spells or higher, and it is likely that 2-3 of them are clerics. 

Magic higher than 3rd level would be exceptionally rare and require a special effort to track down. 

The general implications are probably as follows:
#### Clerics

1. The spells that have the greatest effect on worldbuilding are cleric cantrips, and to a lesser extent 1st level cleric spells. Considering only non-damage, non-combat spells, and picking a few key ones...
	1. Guidance: while this does not have a major effect on worldbuilding, it can be used to flavor effective prayers being fairly common
	2. Light: with only an hour duration, doesn't really substitute for electricity or oil lamps, but probably should consider things like the priest of a market town spending 10 minutes walking the public square and lighting it up for an hour past dark
	3. Mending: the biggest impact on worldbuilding. if mending is generally available in most market towns, things last longer in general, and temples/religions could use as a source of funds e.g, a market stall to fix things in exchange for a small donation
	4. Create or Destroy Water: this would be very effective for firefighting, and might help explain why towns don't burn down as frequently as they did historically; but it doesn't create enough water to sustain a population in the absence of a non-magical water source, or prevent a drought from destroying crops
	5. Cure Wounds, Healing Word: in my opinion, the major worldbuilding implication here is we can assume childbirth is very safe, or at least if there are complications as long as you get a cleric you can save the child or the mother or both fairly easily. this can also be used for things like setting broken bones, healing damage from minor injuries, etc. generally use the ready availablity of cure wounds as a substitute for modern medicine to give the world a more more demographic flavor (childbirth is not super-dangerous, child mortality is not super high)
	6. Purify Food and Drink, Detect Poison and Disease: major use would be stopping water-borne disease. the cleric blesses the well and people stop getting sick; Detect Poison and Disease can trace the source of outbreaks. 
2. At 2nd level, you get a few addiitonal worldbuilding implications, primarily for large cities where 2nd level casters are more common
	1. Augury: mostly for flavor, but people asking the local priest for advice would not be too atypical; only works 1/day per cleric though
	2. Continual Flame: despite the costly material components, would be extremely valuable for producing lanterns in big cities, and in many cases streets should be lit at night not by oil lamps but by continual flame lamps (however, theft might be a problem). Permanent lanterns would be a thing but an expensive, luxury item.
	3. Enhance Ability, Locate Object: mostly flavor, really, but you would have prayers of finding and other kinds of prayers 
	4. Lesser Restoration: major impact on disease; although you can only cure a few people per day, and so can't stop a massive outbreak, this can make disease burden much closer to modern day than to typical medieval conditions
	5. Zone of Truth: in some places, this may be common enough to be part of criminal proceedings, especially in places like Dunmar where priests are judges
3. At 3rd level, spells start to really scale in power, with things like Sending, Speak with Dead, Create Food and Water, Clairvoyance, Tongues having potentially major impacts on the world. But in general, these are rare enough that while accessible they aren't common enough to majorly affect worldbuliding - these are just there for things like the population of city X survived a siege longer than expected by supplementing their supplies with Create Food and Water, etc.
