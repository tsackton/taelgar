This note tries to draw together information from various sources to form a semi-canonical history of humanity in the Greater Sembaran region, intended to inform development of Sembara, Tyrwingha, Maseau, Addermarch, Tollen, Zimkova, and Vostok. Sections in %% notes %% should not be considered canonical. The rest generally is, although this specific background doc is not meant as direct world lore.

## Context
The most important context for the history of humanity in the Greater Sembara area are the three migrations:

* The northerners who came across the Sentinels from the west, long before the Downfall
* The eastern mariners, who came from the eastern green sea, shortly before the Downfall
* The Drankorians, who came from the south, during the first phase of Drankorian expansion after the Downfall

Each of these waves of migration lead to significant cultural intermixing and the birth of new cultures. 
## Earliest Migrations
The first humans arrived in the Greater Sembaran region in the years between 3450 and 3650 %% this is not necessarily canonical, but it should be somewhat before the founding of Tollen %% from the west, crossing over the Sentinels. These earliest migrants spoke a Northros language, and worshipped in the tradition of the [[Northern Folk Religions]], although the exact details of their culture and language have been lost to time. They spread east, amongst the many rivers and lakes of the Upper Volta.

To the south, the land that would become the heartlands of Sembara was a great swamp, the home to a mighty lizardfolk empire, and all the land between the Enst and Wistel river valleys was swamp and given over to the lizardfolk. And south of the lizardfolk, the ancient elven empire still stood.

Over the years, the humans spread east and south, staying mostly in the highlands and the Volta River valley, and by 3850 they started to encounter a new human culture, worshipping unfamiliar gods and speaking an unfamiliar tongue. These were the ancestors of the Skaer, speaking an Eastros tongue, and worshipping one (or pehaps a pantheon) of the ancient mariner gods. These easterns were themselves split into two distinct cultural groups. The Skaer, already worshipping [[Kaikkea]], and dedicated to the ocean, and the settlers, those willing to give up the life of the mariner for the bountiful lands of the Semb, Teft, and Volta River valleys, and the coasts of Vostok and Sembara.

A third human culture, the Tyrwinghans, was settled in the lands claimed by [[Archfey Ethlenn]] by 4000, although whether there origin was northern, eastern, or something else is not decided. 

So at the time of the Downfall, there were four human cultures mixing in the Western Gulf:

* The Zimka, as they came to be known, mostly in the highlands and especially the Upper Volta
* The Skaer, dedicated to the ocean, settled on their islands and dominating the sea and the immediate coasts
* The Tollish culture, a blend of the Skaer and Zimka, speaking a Eastros language but worshipping different gods than the Skaer brethern %% either kestavo or something kestavo like, or a pantheon that died out during the Downfall %%, which came to dominate the lower Semb, the lower Volta, and the Teft river valleys %% Tollen itself could have been seen as Tollish, or it could be seen as Skaer, I'm not sure the distinction is really important at this ancient date %%
* The Tyrwinghans, somewhat isolated from the rest, but with cultural and lingustic ties to the Tollish culture, but also separated from the rest of human culture by the great lizardfolk swamp

Exactly what is happening Vostok at this time is unclear, although there are at least two cultural strands: in the northern parts of Vostok, a culture with close ties to the Zimka has developed, whereas the southern coasts are part of the Tollish and Skaerish cultures. But whether a third cultural strand has appeared in Vostok is not determined.

## The Downfall
The Downfall impacts the lizardfolk and elves more than the humans. The great lizardfolk kingdoms vanish, surviving only in the small settlements in Ozobal and elsewhere along the river deltas, and the elves retreat to their isolated forest of Orenlas. Many humans die, but the basic Zimka/Tollish/Skaer cultures survive, as do the Tyrwinghans, who are mostly unscathed, likely due to the influence and protection of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. 

During the next three hundred or so years, the Skaer blossom and an Skaegish Empire spreads along the coasts, ruling and influencing the Tollish culture that had developed in the river valleys and coasts. Some Tollish retreat into the highlands, and mix with the Zimka there.

By the year 4400, as the Drankorian expansion begins in the south, there are several human cultures;

* An increasingly isolated northerner branch of the Zimka, preserving the kestavo traditions and speaking a Northros language, mostly in the Upper Volta, but with ties to a northern Vostok culture as well. 
* A Tollish/Zimka culture, speaking Old Tollish, but increasingly seeing itself as culturally connected to the traditionalist Zimka, and worshipping the kestavo, in the foothills of the Sentinels and the southern river valleys, speaking an Eastros language  %% how they ended up worshipping the kestavo is undefined here %%, increasingly seeing itself in opposition or at least as different from the coastal Skaer
* The Skaer Empire, dominating the coast, speaking Skaegish and worshipping [[Kaikkea]]
* The Tyrwinghans, in their pocket of the world

Again, Vostok is unclear. This would be an opportune time for interesting things to be happening in Vostok. The coastal Vostok culture at this time is likely dominated by the Skaer.
## Coming of Drankor
Between 4475 and 4535 (330s - 400s, DR) Drankor rapidlly expands north, and the Istabor Valley, Cymea, and Sembara and settled by the rapidly growing Drankorian population.

In Istabor and Cymea there are few humans as these lands were once part of the great non-human empires. The Drankorian culture dominates here. North of the Mostreve Hills, however, the Drankorians encounter the Tollish/Zimka culture, and the coastal people with a more purely Tollish/Skaer culture (%% potentially worshipping different gods than the kestavo %%)

The Skaer Empire largely fades away, from a combination of Drankorian pressure and internal politics, and by 4535, the cultural landscape looks like:

* The old Zimka in the north, as always
* A culture increasingly claiming to be the Zimka, opposed to Drankor (or at least, not part of Drankor), in the highlands and foothills of the Sentinels. This culture develops into the "Zimkovan kingdoms" of [[Breva]], [[Lavnoch]]
* A central Sembaran culture, speaking Drankorian and worshipping Mos Numena, but with some lasting cultural ideas from the kestavo/Tollish/Zimka culture
* A coastal/northern Tollish culture, worshipping Mos Numena and speaking both Drankorian and Old Tollish (this becomes Telham/Tollen area)
* A southern culture, in [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] and the [[Istaros Watershed]], somewhat more purely Drankorian, and worshipping Mos Numena
* A Tyrwinghan culture, spreading somewhat into Addermarch as well, increasingly urbanizing and adopting some Drankorian ways, but with its own unique language and cultural identity

Vostok? It feels like perhaps the coastal Tollish culture is spreading into near southern Vostok here? But interior Vostok is pretty unexplored in the above.

## Fall of Drankor
For 600-700 years, Drankor rules the Sembaran Provinces in (mostly) peace, and the culture evolves during this time, especially along the borders. 

* In the north, the Zimka increasingly remain kestavan worshippers, and the "old" and "new" Zimka increasingly intermingle and reunify. The Eastros-based language comes to dominate, although some small pockets of Old Zimka remain, especially in a ritual context, and many of the kestavo have Old Zimka names. 
* In the central Sembaran provinces, the intercessionist form of Mos Numena develops and a broad Sembaran culture starts to form
* In Tyrwingha, there is much intermixing with the Sembaran culture, but a strong traditionalist attitude as well, and the Tyrwinghan language remains common in rural areas, but the Sembaran form of worship is adopted with some small Tyrwinghan flavors
* Maseau and the Istabor Watershed increasingly develops a l

## The Modern Era

In the modern era (since the Great War), the Greater Sembaran region has been the home to a number of different cultural elements:

* The ~Old Zimkovans~, a traditionalist and declining culture limited to the foothills of the Sentinels and the upper headwaters of the Volta River. This culture preserves many of the ancient northern ways, worships the kestavo, and speaks a Northros language. These people have never been conqueored by Drankor nor Sembara
* The ~New Zimkovans~, a blended culture that maintains a significant shared identity with the ~Old Zimkovans~, but where many of them worship Mos Numena, and speak a Eastros dervived but Drankorian influenced language. These people were never conqueored by Drankor, but have, at times, been part of the larger Sembaran Empire, although since 1650 they have been independent
* The Sembarans, a Drankorian derived culture but with significant influences from both Tollenders and Zimkovans. Some cultural differences between the northern Sembarans, especially in the highlands and the Duchy of Telham, and the southern Sembarans persist. The northern strands of Sembaran culture tend to be more Tollish/Zimkovan, and the southern more Drankorian/Isinguese. Speaks a Eastros/Drankorian blended language and worships Mos Numea. 
* The Tyrwinghans, an ancient culture of unclear origin, although with significant assimilation trends and a lot of Drankorian and Sembaran influences. Worships Mos Numena, and mostly speaks Sembaran, but with a significant minority that speak Tyrwinghan, an ancient language with some relationships to Eastros 





## Fall of Drankor
The Fall of Drankor brings chaos and disruption: both Skaer raiders from the east and plague from the south. When the dust settles, the six duchies that eventually form Sembara are well established, largely the inheritances of ancient Drankorian provinces. This is probably also the period when Tyrwingha establishes its traditions, including the Oracle of the Riven. 

Not considered here are the southern stretches such as Maseau and Addermarch. But I think these are probably more marginal lands, less fertile and harder to farm, and many people retreat from these lands to richer soils in the valleys during the chaos and collapse of Drankor -- more to the south towards Isingue than to the north.

The [[Timeline of Sembaran History]] tells a story about conquest in Zimka, but I no longer really like that history. I think instead it is more satisfying to just have depopulation and retreat.
