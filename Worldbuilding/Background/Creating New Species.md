# Typology for Introducing D&D Creatures
 
The multiverse, gods, and the story of creation are organized somewhat differently in Taelgar than a standard D&D universe. Still, most, if not all, D&D creatures can fit in somewhere. Here are some guidelines.

### Sentient, Self-Aware Natives of the [[Inner Realms]]

These creatures, the sentient, self-aware natives of the [[Inner Realms]], are animated and made aware by the presence of a soul made of [[~soulstuff~]]. When these creatures die, this fragment of [[~soulstuff~]] typically passes to the [[Land of the Dead]], and eventually beyond into the [[Outer Realms]], to whatever fate awaits. 

What distinguishes these sentient species from each other is typically the manner of their creation. 

1. **Children of the Embodied Gods**. The [[Elder Folk]] -- the elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk, and stoneborn -- are the creations of the [[Embodied Gods]], a unique category of divine being endowed with a physical manifestation by the [[Divine Presence]]. These five species are granted, by connection to their creator deities, unique magical abilities, and dominated much of the early history of the world, giving them a unique place in the current day. In addition to the five species listed, variants may also exist. The gnomes, for example, represent a long-sundered lineage of dwarves, and other long-lost “branches'' of the elder species may also exist. The orcs, although not counted among the [[Elder Folk]], are metaphysically in this category, as the creations of [[Thark]], an embodied god spawned not by the [[Divine Presence]], but by the machinations of the [[Void Mind]]. 
2. **Direct Creations of the Divine Presence.** Humans, unlike any other known species on Taelgar, are the direct creations of the Divine Presence breathing the essence of creation, the divine spark, into material form. Metaphysically, the [[Goblinoids]] are also in this category, in that they are created by the direct embodiment of [[~soulstuff~]] into a living form, but they are the spawn of the [[Void Mind]], acting in secret to steal and twist the power of the [[Divine Presence]]
3. **Children of the Divine**. The original children of the [[Divine Presence]] -- the great wyrms, titans, elder elementals, and archfey -- themselves spawned many creations and species, endowed with [[~soulstuff~]] by a diverse array of magic and mechanisms. Any creature with a dragon, fey, elemental, or giant type, or which can be conceptually related to those types, can be a descendant, echo, creation, or perversion of these original children of the divine. The [[Kobolds]], for example, are the creations of ancient dragons in the days of myth, and the various [[Fey]] species are descended from the original [[Archfey]]. 
4. **Awakened Species.** There are a number of species that were given minds, awareness, and sentience by the awakening, modification, or corruption of otherwise soulless or empty creatures. The descendants of these awakened creatures can still be found on Taelgar today. Many plant and beast creatures with intelligence and language arose in this way, as did some monstrosities and perhaps a few aberrations or constructs. "Talking Animal" species, such as bullywugs, might fit into this category, unless they are in the "other species" category below. 
5. **Cursed Species.** A number of sentient, self-aware creatures or species were originally something else, but have been cursed in some way, often by agents of the [[Void Mind]]. The most common of these are the sentient undead and lycanthropes, but others may exist. This category can also include creatures such as the [[Derro]], once dwarves whose connection to the [[Bahrazel]] was severed by mind flayers to create slaves for their underground empires. 
6. **Unusual Species**. Many species, of course, have unique origins that do not neatly fit into any of the categories above. Any species that is a native to the [[Inner Realms]], sentient/self-aware, and does not fit neatly into any of the above categories can fit here. Examples that are known include the [[Kenku]], the[[Merfolk]], and the [[Centaurs]]. 

### Soulless Natives of the [[Inner Realms]]

7. **Beasts**. Many creatures, typically of limited intelligence and self-awareness, populate the world of Taelgar. The diverse beasts that populate the land, as well as some monstrosities and other such creatures, are not animated by [[~soulstuff~]]. These may have been created in many different ways: by the [[Divine Presence]], the [[Children of the Divine]], the [[Embodied Gods]], or other, stranger ways. 
8. **Magical Species**. While beasts, broadly defined, lack sentience and self-awareness, there are many soullless creatures on Taelgar that are nonetheless self-aware. Typically, these species and creatures are the creation of magic, and mimic the awareness created by [[~soulstuff~]] with arcane energy. Many constructs, as well as some other creatures, fall into this category. These creatures may arise from experiments, rituals, strong magic, or other extraordinary events. Purely animated/created non-sentient creatures, such as many corporeal undead, golems, and many constructs, may also fall into this category despite lacking any self-awareness beyond the ability to follow orders. 

### Natives of the [[Outer Realms]]

9. **Children of Creation**. Any creature or species that arises directly from [[~soulstuff~]] and is native to the [[Outer Realms]] fits in this category. Classic examples include fiends and celestials. A fundamental aspect of these creatures and species is that they cannot be killed on the material plane: if they are defeated in the [[Inner Realms]], they simply dissipate and reform on their native plane.
10. **Divinities**. Any creature that is a pure representation of the energy of the [[Plane of Creation]] can be considered a divinity. Divinities -- which include the [[Embodied Gods]] and the [[Incorporeal Gods]], as well as creatures such as the [[Tanshi]] and the [[Kestavo]] -- are distinct from the Children of Creation primarily in terms of their power. Left undetermined is whether powerful archdevils and demon lords and the like are more akin to Divinities or Children of Creation. 

### Natives of the Far Realms

11. **Alien Species**. There are many things flung across the universe that are older, and stranger, than the world of Taelgar. Many aberrations, and especially mind flayers, are ultimately invaders from these Far Realms, and many of these invaders created twisted creations to be their slaves, prey, or entertainment, some of whom still linger in the world. While at the moment, the only canonical invaders to Taelgar are from ancient and disturbing Far Realms, some races and creatures that are traditionally associated with Spelljammer in D&D could have an origin via this mechanism, or via a similar “transport from other timelines” type mechanism. 

## Decision Tree for Adding New Races

Is the creature part of a civilization with a history, culture, religious beliefs, language, diversity of thought and opinion? 

- No: You are likely looking 7 or 8, or maybe 5; the choice depends largely on lore and fit. In general, 7 is more low-intelligence “natural” species, 8 is more high intelligence “cursed” species, and 5 is more "corrupted" species, but YMMV. For example, hydra are likely 7; dopplegangers are likely 8; medusa are likely 5. 
- Yes, and native to the inner realms:
	- If created by an embodied god, or a variant of such a species: 1 (but be very cautious about introducing new embodied gods or variants of elder folk without very good reason)
	- If created directly by a high god (Divine Presence or Void Mind): 2 (but be even more cautious about expanding this list beyond humans and goblinoids)
	- If related to dragons, fey, giants, or elementals: 3
	- If related to a "normal" beast, plant, etc, but intelligent: 4
	- If related to mind flayers or other aberrations, to various manipulations of the void mind, or other kinds of corruptions: 5
- Yes, but native to something that isn't an inner plane:
	- Comes from the outer realms: 9
	- Comes from a far realm: 11

If there is not an obvious choice: is it a major part of a campaign (current or past) that, for plot/story reasons, needs a complex culture and backstory?

- Consider whether it could be a Void Mind trick in an existing metaphysical category, e.g. an "evil" myconoid species or insect species could be 4, awakened by an agent of the void mind.
- Consider whether it could be a corruption or creation of a Far Realm power. Many "slave species" could fit into 5, twisted from their original form by mind flayers, aboleths, or other alien powers. 
- Consider whether it could be native to a yet-undescribed Far Realm, potentially with a radically different vibe than typical Far Realms, in which case consider 11. 
- Consider whether it could have some distant connection to fey, giants, dragons, or elements, in which case 3 could fit.
- Consider whether it could represent a extraplanar entity possessing and twisting something native to the Material Plane, in which case 9 could fit. For example, gnolls, who are fiends (demons) insubstantiated into the bodies of carnivores on the material plane, would fit in this category. Should, in this case, be created, not born. 
- Consider whether this might be an exceptional case where a soullless species nonetheless develops into something with depth and culture. Likely, in this case, to require special/extenuating circumstances and likely some strong connection to some kind of magic. An example might, potentially, be some kind of construct species. 
- If nothing else fits, consider 6. 

### Key Distinctions of Choices

- Creatures from 1-6 have souls that, when they die, go to the Land of the Dead. Resurrection magic works per the usual Taelgar metaphysics. Creatures from 7-8 simply cease to exist when they are killed, and cannot be resurrected by normal means. Creatures from 9-10 dissipate and reappear on their native plane if killed on the material plane. Creatures from 11 can have any weird or unusual metaphysics desired. 

- Creatures from 1-3, plus 6, are created by something, and given a fragment of [[~soulstuff~]] at the moment of creation. Creatures from 4 or 5 are modified or derived from something that already exists. Creatures from 7-8 can have diverse origin stories, but not involving [[~soulstuff~]]. 
 
- Creatures from 9 are, by definition, not be native to the material plane, and vanish to their native plane when killed. Some particularly powerful creatures from 1 may also share this property, especially archfey and elementals, but in this case the key distinction is their native planes are (typically, but there are exceptions to every rule) echo realms or energy planes, not part of the domain of souls (outer planes in traditional D&D terminology).
 
- Creatures from 7 and 8 are distinguished by having no obvious gods or souls or afterlife. Some, such as undead and lycanthropes, may have such a thing from a former existence. Intelligence beast-like creatures that are intended to have souls and possibly worship gods should be 4 or 6, unless there is a clear special case that makes sense. Creatures in 5 are transformations of something else, usually.

- Creatures from 11 should also not be native to the material plane, but are not from extraplanar realms, at least not ones created by human beliefs. This can be a pretty generic catch-all category for things that come from elsewhere, don’t have a Taelgar specific story, but are useful/interesting for a plot. Twisted creations of mind flayers and aboleths (in particular) would typically be 5, not 11, unless they were "brought over" from the far realm.

- Creatures from 4, 5 and 6 are generally catch-all categories for anything that doesn't fit elsewhere. 

See the [[Species]] section for how this plays out.
