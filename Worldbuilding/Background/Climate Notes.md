%% i have some old current and wind maps and notes in OneNote %%

It makes heavy use of the [KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification](https://www.mindat.org/climate.php)

Some classifications of common places:

* Insingue - Cwa/BSk
* Sembara - Dwa to Dwb in highlands
* Cymea - Dfa to Cfa in south
* Tyrwingha - Dfa
* "Eastern Dunmari Peninsula" - Cwa bit of Aw/As

Reminders about climate types:

* Cwa and Cfa are both sub-tropical - think Southeastern US, where Cfa is more rainfall year round.

%% old notes from OneNote
Westerlies: middle latitudes, roughly 35 to 65 degrees, wind blows west to east
Trades: subtropical/tropical, winds blow from northeast in N. hemi and southeast in S. hemi

So, in Taelgar:
From ~Chardon north to northern reaches of continent, winds blow west to east.
From ~GapOfChardon south to equator, winds blow east to west

High pressure zone around 30: stretching across north-central Dunmar, southern Plaguelands, and south edge of Green Sea.

General rainfall / wet season patterns:
-Mediterranean climates tend to have wet winters, dry summers, usually on west side of continents between 30 and 45 degrees; subtropical ridge extends north in summer, high pressure = no rain.
-tropical/subtropical climates tend to have wet summers, dry winters
-monsoons are associated with a shift in the wind
-rainfall in form of heavy late afternoon thunderstorms
-tropical rainy zone moves N/S, reaching furthest north in summer and furthest south in winter

ADDED OCT 2022:

Need to shift the desert north a bit to put it more centrally in the horse latitudes and approx where Sahara is.
