To make travel more realistic, without making travel excessively complicated, consider the following:

**Terrain**: Wildness terrain comes in 5 categories:
	- High Quality Road: a well-maintained, high quality road, such as ancient Drankorian roads, well maintained major Chardonian roads, and similar
	- Road: a "normal" road, or well-maintained track, that provides a clear path with few obstalces
	- Normal Terrain: typical travel overland but through fields, grasslands, light forests, or through denser forests or other terrain but on a clear path
	- Difficult Terrain: dense forests, swamps, hills
	- Extremely Difficult Terrain: alpine hiking, glaciers, dense/thick jungles or swamps

**Travel Time**: Assume 8 hours per day; longer risks exhaustion but is possible

**Pace**
- Fast: 4 miles per hour, disadvantage on perception, cannot stealth
- Normal: 3 miles per hour
- Slow: 2 miles per hour, can stealth

Other modifiers:
- Mounted: increases pace on road, good road
- Mounted with change of horses: increases pace and travel time on normal, road, good road




|             | Extreme Terrain | Difficult Terrain | Normal Terrain | Road  | High Quality Road |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| Foot        | 0.5/0.75/1      | 1/1.5/2           | 2/3/4          | 2/3/4 | 2/3/4             |
| Horse       | 0.5/0.75/1      | 1/1.5/2           | 2/3/4          | 3/4/5 | 4/5/6             |
| Horse Relay | 0.5/0.75/1      | 1/1.5/2           | 2/3/4          | 4/5/6 | 5/6/8             |

You can't sustain a fast pace on a horse for more than a day or two without a change of mounts; you can't sustain a fast pace with a horse relay for more than say 4-5 days without a chance of mounts.
