### Ethlenn and Umbraeth

Umbraeth was originally a powerful courtier in Ethlenn's court - probably an archfey, but a weaker one. His nature is chaotic and deceitful, but he loved the glimmer and elegance of Twilight's Grace.

However, at some point in the 600s DR he violated Ethlenn's rules against tricking the mortals of Tyrwingha, and was exiled to Duskmire, at the time just a small realm over the Darkwood.

He was banished to never be able to cross the Sunset Gate, outside his own realm, nor to enter Twilight's Grace, and in exchange, Ethlenn agreed to stay her hand and not kill him.

When Cloudspinner fell, he expanded his domain substantially, but he cannot cross the Sunset Gate.
