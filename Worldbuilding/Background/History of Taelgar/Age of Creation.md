## The Age of Creation

As the Age of Myth ended, and the world was changed, the lands of Taelgar stood empty, only the small remnants of the great empires of the children of the divine that managed to survive the riving remaining. In the moment of the Riving, the embodied gods created the Elder Races. First, the elves, followed by the stoneborn, the lizardfolk, the dwarves, and finally the halflings.

The Age of Creation -- reckoned as the second age of the world by the elves, and the beginning of the count of years by the dwarves -- was a time when the Elder Races grew to dominate the landscape. They walked the land, built great civilizations, created, and lived, and died, their souls going to join their creators. The realms of the Firstborn, and the world of Taelgar, filled with life.
