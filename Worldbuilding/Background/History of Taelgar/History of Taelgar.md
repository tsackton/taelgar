# History of Taelgar
This is an attempt to organize the notes and background we have on the history of Taelgar into a single document that can be considered relatively canonical. This is intended to be conversational and living, with the following conventions:

Information in %% notes %% is brainstorming or non-canonical. This document attempts to keep from growing too much by creating separate notes for other periods and other aspects where more detail is needed.

## Overview
The mythic history of Taelgar is organized around four major metaphysically distinct eras, each marked by significant changes to the extraplanar order. 

In broad strokes, the history of Taelgar can be summarized as:

The **Age of Myth**, when the multiverse was new, a period before time itself was created. The Age of Myth begin with the first act of creation and are a time of the archfey, titans, elements, and great wyrms, a time when the power of arcane magic coursed unchecked through the multiverse and altering reality was as simple as a thought. This was a time of huge empires and incredible acts of magic, but also of much chaos. This age ended with [[The Riving]], when the [[Divine Presence]] separates the planes of existence from each other and creates the [[Material Plane]].

The **Age of Creation**, when the first divinities came into being, and the [[Elder Folk]] flourished. This age began as the [[Multiverse]] was established by the [[Divine Presence]], and the [[Embodied Gods]] created the [[Elder Folk]]. This is the golden age of the non-human species, when the vast civilizations of [[elves]], [[Dwarves|dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and others spread across the world, but also a time that lacked dynamism. Little changed or was truly new in this age, as the Firstborn of the Elder Folk channeled the raw creative force of ~soulstuff~ into sameness and uniformity. The Age of Creation ended with the [[Creation of Humans]] and the breaking of the barriers that contained and constrained the creative force of [[~soulstuff~]].

The **Age of Divinity** began with the [[Creation of Humans]], and the shattering of the walls that isolated the [[Material Plane]] and kept the creative force of [[~soulstuff~]] from affecting the wider multiverse. Humans, created by the [[Divine Presence]] itself on [[Hkar]], were unlike anything that had come before, for they were granted the Divine Spark, the ability of their beliefs to shape the very reality of the multiverse, creating [[Incorporeal Gods]] out of the material of creation itself. This was an age of great change, as the greatest hopes and darkest fears of humanity were manifest in [[~soulstuff~]]. It was also an age when other, darker things were created by the machinations of the [[Void Mind]]. The Age of Divinity ended with the the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the destruction of [[Hkar]], and the diminishment of the power of the Divine Spark on the [[Material Plane]]. 

The **Age of Humanity** began with the sinking of [[Hkar]] and the reshaping of the world that accompanied the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. This age saw the rise and fall of Drankor, and the rise and fall of Cha'mutte, and much growth and change among human cultures. This age saw, for the first time, humanity growing to dominant the cultures of Taelgar, and the history of this age is dominated by the history of humanity. 
## Age of Myth

The [[Age of Myth]] was an era before time had meaning, and before the separation of the planes. Although it is difficult to speak of "events" in this period, the key events of the Age of Myth were:

* The birth of the [[Divine Presence]] and the awakening of the [[Void Mind]]
* The creation of the [[Children of the Divine]]: the [[Great Wyrms]], the [[Titans]], the [[Archfey]], and the [[Elder Elementals]].

%% elder elementals are like krakens and phoenixes and the like: Gazankoa, not mere marids. %%

These children of the divine created many things, but all were echoes or distortions of themselves, and although great empires and cities arose and disappeared, nothing was stable. 

The Age of Myth ended with [[The Riving]], which lead to the creation of the [[Mulitverse]]. 

%% key points:
- at this stage, there is no conception of other planes. the material plane itself is infused with limitless arcane energy, and magic is easy and powerful. 
- there are no gods but the Divine Presence, and no humanoids, there are just the fey, the dragons, the giants, and the elementals. 
- the form of the world is totally unfixed, as the powerful entities who live on what is Taelgar then use arcane magic to constantly reshape the world into their imagining
- probably does not need extensive history; in any case linear causality is not necessarily a thing during this age so 
%%

## The Riving

Between the end of the [[Age of Myth]] and the beginning of the [[Age of Creation]] was an event, [[The Riving]], both instantaneous and eternal, a time out of time when the basic form of the  [[Multiverse]] was fixed by the [[Divine Presence]]. During [[The Riving]]:
- The chaotic arcane energy of true magic was pulled from the [[Material Plane]], creating the [[Plane of Magic]] and the [[Ethereal Plane]], and leaving behind the scars of [[Ley Lines]], through which arcane magic could still reach into the world, but requiring significant effort and skill. 
- At this moment of separate, some of the [[Children of the Divine]] fled the [[Material Plane]], and created their own [[Energy Realms]] from the raw energy of magic. The most prominent of these are the [[Elemental Planes]] created by the [[Elder Elementals]]; whether other Energy Realms exist is not recorded. 
- The force of this rupture created resonances and echos that still reverberate to the current day, and which shaped and guided the [[Echo Realms]]. Most prominent among these is the [[Feywild]], an echo of the [[Material Plane]], and home to the [[Archfey]] of old. But many other [[Echo Realms]] are thought to exist, shaped from the resonances that still surround the [[~inner realms~]] of the multiverse. 
- During [[The Riving]], the [[Divine Presence]] spun out from itself a creative force, distinct from the chaotic energy of the [[Plane of Magic]], the raw material of sentience and self-awareness, in the form of the [[Astral Plane]]. From this creative power, the [[Embodied Gods]] came into being.
- As [[The Riving]] came to an end, the [[Embodied Gods]] created the [[Elder Folk]], sentient species endowed with souls made of this raw material of creation, [[~soulstuff~]]. 
## Age of Creation
_1 - 1520 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The [[Age of Creation]] began as [[The Riving]] ended, the [[Multiverse]] was fixed in form, and the [[Embodied Gods]], imbued with the power of creation by the [[Divine Presence]], brought into being something new, the [[Elder Folk]], sentient creatures endowed with [[~soulstuff~]] by their divine creators. 

Over the course of the Age, the [[Elder Folk]] learned magic, and writing, and grew, and prospered:

* The elves, while never very numerous, possessed great wisdom, exceptionally long lifespans, and a powerful command of magic. These traits made the elves the undisputed ruler of the age, and they founded two great empires. In the north, the kingdom of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. grew to stretch from the forests south of [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] to the Mostreve Hills and the Cymean foothills. In the south, the kingdom of Tinwerquë spread from sea to sea in the tropical and subtropical forests south of the great savannahs of the interior.  %% Note: Is Tinwerquë canonical? %%
* The stoneborn, even less numerous than elves, and always reclusive, do not figure greatly in the stories that remain from these times. As always, the stoneborn hid away in their barren retreats, in the high peaks, the frozen north, and the depths of deserts. However, legends of great masters of art and craft, trained by the Stoneborn, demonstrate the mark they still made on the world.  
* The lizardfolk remained largely in their homelands, in the vast coastal swamps of the southern [[Green Sea]], stretching from north of what is now the great desert all the way to the Sembaran lowlands.
* The dwarves grew quickly after they awoke under the [[Sentinel Range]], known to them as [[Labkhan]], and began to build great halls, delving deeper underground. During the Age of Creation, the dwarves were little seen to the outside world, as their underground kingdoms slowly grew to span all of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], from the far north to the borders of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. By the end of the Age, they were beginning to stretch out, moving to new mountains in the east and west and north, beginning to excavate and build again. 
* The halflings, always wanderers, spread across the [[Green Sea]], and along the coasts, although from where, originally, they came, lore does not say, and the halflings themselves do not share. While they traveled everywhere, they remained most prevalent along the shores of the [[Green Sea]], along the southeast coast of the continent, and across the great plains of the interior.

%%
Undetermined is when the Orcs were created. One possibility is that orcs, in the far reaches of the world, were created during this period, perhaps concurrently with the rest of the Children of the Embodied Gods. A second possibility is that Thark is not able to create the orcs for some reason until later, either late in the Age of Creation or during the Age of Divinity. From a demographic standpoint, orcs are expected to have a very small initial creation, a very high birth rate, and a very high death rate. So it takes a while for them to be noticed, so they cannot be created too late.

Broadly then, there are three simple possibilities for the orcish creation:
* At the beginning of the Age of Creation, totally unknown to anyone. This works from a "parallel to Elder Folk" but adds some 'darkness' to the otherwise idyllic Age of Creation
* Sometime during the Age of Creation, perhaps late. I'm not sure there are any benefits to this, unless the creation of orcs is meant to be some type of trigger for the creation of humans
* At the beginning or just after the beginning of the Age of Divinity. This would make them align with the creation of humans and hobgoblins

It is likely not necessary to decide this at the moment, until/unless we want to flesh out the details of the Age of Divinity and/or the metaphysics of orcs. The most relevant concerns are probably on the transition from "peace" to "defensive empires" amongst the elves and dwarves and the metaphysics of Thark's ability to create orcs in the first place.

And yet, the [[Divine Presence]] was not satisfied. After millennia, the world of Taelgar was static. While no longer ever changing and full of the chaotic energy of the intermingled planes, in the balance of chaos and order, the pendulum had swung too far. The embodied gods had put too much of themselves into their creations, and year after year followed like clockwork. 
## Age of Divinity
_1520-4122 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The Age of Divinity began in the year 1520 by the Dwarven Count, with the [[Creation of Humans]] on the island of [[Hkar]], raised by the [[Divine Presence]] with the gift of the Divine Spark. Over the next 2500 years, humans grew powerful, and explored across the world, but the Void Mind also worked in the shadows, and the Age of Divinity ends in cataclysm. 

The Age of Divinity, like the Age of Creation, began with an upheaval of the [[Multiverse]], one with far-reaching impacts but a far less dramatic beginning. Throughout the long [[Age of Creation]], the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation. Although the [[Embodied Gods]] could easily reach across this barrier, to grant miracles and change the Material Plane, the magic of souls could not act, except through the Embodied Gods. With the [[Creation of Humans]], this changed. 

At the beginning of the Age of Divinity, [[Humans|humanity]] is created, and granted the gift of the Divine Spark, the ability of their souls to work magic and shape the creation of new things in the multiverse. The [[Land of the Dead]] ceases to be a barrier to the magic of creation, and the hopes, dreams, fears, and nightmares of early humans gather force and power. Sometimes shaped by the best of humanity, other times by the twisted creations of the [[Void Mind]], the world in the Age of Divinity is both a more vibrant and more dangerous place, and through the magic of the divine spark, eventually both [[Incorporeal Gods]] and diverse [[~outer realms~]] come into existence.

Additionally, the Void Mind does more two things at this time:
* During the [[Creation of Humans]], manages to [[Creation of the Hobgoblins|create the hobgoblins]]
* Allows or creates cracks in the fabric of reality, allowing the mind flayers and other alien species an entrance into Taelgar
%% The exact timing of the Void Mind activities is not canonically determined %%

As the Age of Divinity begins, the [[Embodied Gods]] of the [[Elder Folk]] sense a turn in the air, a feeling of coming darkness, a premonition, but lacking detail. 

* Among the elves, warnings of danger from [[Elmerca]] begin, and while the elven empires turn to prepare for war, no dangers materialize. Over time, the influence of the ~Wardens of Elmerica~ fade, though the premonitions don't cease. The ~Wardens of Elmerica~ persist as a small, somewhat isolated group, warning of a great danger that never seems to come, while elven society seems to move on around and without them.
* Among the Dwarves, the warnings begin among the ~Cult of the Warrior~, a small group who claim that the Bahrazel known as Azar, the ~Prophet~, is calling them to a new thuhr, a warrior thuhr, to defend the safety of the dwarven people. Dwarven society splits among those who turn to fortifications and defense, and those who wish to flee the mountains, for few dare to reject warnings of the ~Prophet~. For several generations, there is stasis, and debate, until the first wars between the mind flayers and the dwarves erupt deep beneath the earth. Many dwarves, who later become the gnomes, flee the mountains. Many others stay, and fortify their homes. The warrior thuhr becomes established as the defender of dwarven society, deep below the earth.  %% this is one version of events, could be edited / elaborated on %%

%% To be determined: exact timing of these premonitions is unclear, and whether stoneborn/halflings/lizardfolk are impacted is left undetermined %%

The Age of Divnity aligns with the grow and expansion of humanity, and in many ways the growth of humanity, and humanity's interaction with the non-human races, is the most important story of the age. The specific history of Hkar is intentionally left blank, although there are some events that are dated back to Hkar (in particular, the story of  [[Sarqon]] and the [[Chainshroud]] as recounted by the [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Binding Stones]]). Instead, it is best to understand the events on Hkar via the influences they had on religious history, and the migrations from Hkar (which then had significant effects on the development of other human cultures outside of Hkar).

The first period of humanity on Hkar, lasting roughly three hundred years, is best thought of as the era of personal deities.  This period is characterized by:
* Simple religious beliefs focused around the concept of each human having a personal god
* Extremely rapid population growth as humanity spreads across an idyllic, empty homeland
* A culture without access to arcane or primal magic, but with a rich and complex relationship to "miracles"
* The origin of many of the [[Primal Realms]] as the divine spark within the early humans influences the spiritual realms

By 1850 or so, the first cults start to develop, as charismatic humans realize that if other people worship their personal gods, they get stronger. This rapidly develops into a widely diverse set of beliefs that could all be characterized as "small gods". This period is characterized by a diversification of culture on Hkar, as different religious practices fragment the uniformity of the early human culture. Exactly what this means is intentionally left blank. Religiously and magically, little changes.

Around 2550, however, the first humans leave Hkar (the Northerners, in later parlance). The reasons for this are undefined and unclear, but:
* These migrants are not explorers or colonists, but settlers. That is, they do not have a lot of contact back with Hkar
* They spread across the northern part of Taelgar, bringing with them a variety of [[Northern Folk Religions]], all derived from the common religious practices 

The departure of these migrants, and their subsequent discovery (to humans) of the mainland of Taelgar, and the Elder Folk, ushers in an era of rapid change. Over the next 200 years (from 2250 - 2750)

Around the year 2500 (or perhaps a little early), a number of changes come to Hkar:
* The first cults of personality develop, which within a short period (~100 years?) lead to the era of small gods as the idea of cults rapidly develops into the idea of small, local gods. Religious ritual (as opposed to personal miracles) starts to develop
* The first migration leaves the island: the Northerners, who make contact with non-humans for the first time

%% The [[Religious History of Taelgar]] doc that I am drawing from here suggests that the era of small gods is a long lasting religious stasis. It also hints, although perhaps doesn't suggest, that the era of personal deities is a long lasting %%

%% notes below 
So the age begins with concern, and tension within the elves and dwarves. Over the next 1000 years, things grow: humans, hobgoblins, orcs, empires. 
* By ~3000, about 1000 years before the fall of Hkar, the first humans are in the mainland, and the first tentative hints of orcs, hobgoblins, mind flayers and others reaches the elder races.
* During the next 1000 years, there is a slow increase in tension. During this time is probably when the great northern wall is built, when the fey start to protect Tyrwingha, when lots of weird magical relics exist, when a lot of evocation and other offensive magic is developed by the elves, all that. 
* By 4000 you have basically the start of a century long war that ends with a partial victory for the “good guys” and a partial defeat, in that Hkar is sacrificed (my vision here is that somehow -- details don’t matter -- a huge army of evil races landed on Hkar, and that its destruction was not a punishment for human failure or anything but a last ditch effect to save humanity from being overwhelmed. Maybe to stop hobgoblin army from getting some ancient powerful magic or to stop the Three Despairs from gaining access to some kind of secret of creation).

During this time as well, the [[Evolution of Human Culture on Hkar|humans are growing and changing on Hkar]], and also departing from Hkar, in the great [[Human Migrations|human migrations]]:

* The first wave of migration, the Northerners, has started to depart Hkar by 2500 %% give or take a bit depending on the exact date of human creation %%, and peaks around 2800
* The second wave of migration, the Southerners, is canonically something that happened but also intentionally left as a blank slate. It is between the northern and mariner migrations in time.
* The third wave of migration, the Mariners, is the source of the [[Languages#Eastros Language Family|Eastros languages]] and many of the eastern Green Sea cultures. This starts around 3500 and peaks soon after, perhaps 3650 %% need to work out how this fits with the timelines of humanity in the eastern Green Sea %%. This migration departs from the western edge of Hkar, and sails around the world to the eastern edge of the Green Sea

In between these major waves of migration from Hkar, there are several smaller ones:

* The canonical Dunmari migration
* Others, potentially, to be determined

It is likely that all migrations after the second wave are culturally cohesive groups, leaving Hkar in some part as a rebellion or in contrast to the growing magical, urban, pantheonic culture of Hkar.

## Age of Humanity
_4122 - present by the Dwarven Count of Years _

The [[Age of Humanity]] begins in the cataclysm of the destruction of [[Hkar]] and the devastation this causes, and ends with the [[Great War]] and the defeat of [[Cha'mutte]]. In between, it saw the rise and fall of the [[Drankorian Empire]] and significant changes in the [[Western Green Sea]] and [[West Coast Region]], as well as the rise of the [[Dunmar|Dunmari]].
