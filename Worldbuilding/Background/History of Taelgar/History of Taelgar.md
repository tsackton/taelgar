# History of Taelgar
This is an attempt to organize the notes and background we have on the history of Taelgar into a single document that can be considered relatively canonical. This is intended to be conversational and living, with the following conventions:

Information in %% notes %% is brainstorming or non-canonical. This document attempts to keep from growing too much by creating separate notes for other periods and other aspects where more detail is needed.

## Overview
The mythic history of Taelgar is organized around three major metaphysically distinct eras, marked by each marked by significant disruptions of the extraplanar order. 

In broad strokes, the history of Taelgar can be summarized as:

%% possible ideas
The Age of Myth is also, in some sense, the age of arcane magic, when the first children of the divine presence use the fact that the plane of magic has not yet been pulled away from the material plane to create great works of magic.
The Age of Creation is when the divine presence empowers divine magic. The chaos of the magical beings of the Age of Myth is tamed, by challenging that magical power into deities. 
The Age of Humanity sees both forces brought into balance, and diminished. 

This also pairs with the existing idea of Chaos vs Order. E.g., Age of Myth = Chaos = Arcane Magic; Age of Creation = Order = Divine Magic. Although the Order vs Chaos is more applicable to the pre-Humanity period of the Age of Creation....tbd
%%

The **Age of Myth**, when the multiverse was new, a period before time itself was created. The Age of Myth begin with the first act of creation and are a time of the archfey, titans, elements, and great wyrms. This age ends with [[The Riving]] when the [[Divine Presence]] separates the planes of existence from each other and creates the [[Material Plane]]. This was a time of huge empires and incredible acts of magic, but also of much chaos.

The **Age of Creation** began after [[The Riving]], when the multiverse was created, and ended with the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the destruction of [[Hkar]], and the diminishment of the power of the Divine Spark on the [[Material Plane]]. It was during the Age of Creation that the [[Elder Folk|oldest sentient species]] of Taelgar were created by [[Embodied Gods]], when the vast civilizations of [[elves]], [[Dwarves|dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and others spread across the world. It was also the age when [[Humans|humans]] were created by the [[Divine Presence]] on [[Hkar]], and endowed with the divine spark; and when other, darker species were created by the [[Void Mind]] and its allies. The Age of Creation ended with the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the destruction of [[Hkar]], and the diminishment of divine magic on Taelgar, especially the creative force of the divine spark. 
%%  1 - 4100  %%
%% Not sure if this makes sense anymore: This is the golden age of the non-human species, but also a time that lacked dynamism. Little changed or was truly new in this age, as the Firstborn of the Elder Folk encouraged sameness and uniformity. %%

The **Age of Humanity** began with the sinking of [[Hkar]] and the reshaping of the world that accompanied the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. This age saw the rise and fall of Drankor, and the rise and fall of Cha'mutte, and much growth and change among human cultures. This age saw, for the first time, humanity growing to dominant the cultures of Taelgar, and the history of this age is dominated by the history of humanity. 
%% 4100 - current day %%

## Age of Myth

The [[Age of Myth]] was an era before time had meaning, and before the separation of the planes. Although it is difficult to speak of "events" in this period, the key events of the Age of Myth were:

* The birth of the [[Divine Presence]] and the awakening of the [[Void Mind]]
* The creation of the [[Children of the Divine]]: the [[Great Wyrms]], the [[Titans]], the [[Archfey]], and the [[Elder Elementals]].

%% elder elementals are like krakens and phoenixes and the like: Gazankoa, not mere marids. %%

These children of the divine created many things, but all were echoes or distortions of themselves, and although great empires and cities arose and disappeared, nothing was stable.

The lore the elves write about the Age of Myth and the Riving can be read here: [[Lore of the Birth of the Gods]].

%% key points:
- at this stage, there is no conception of other planes. the material plane itself is infused with limitless arcane energy, and magic is easy and powerful. 
- there are no gods but the Divine Presence, and no humanoids, there are just the fey, the dragons, the giants, and the elementals. 
- the form of the world is totally unfixed, as the powerful entities who live on what is Taelgar then use arcane magic to constantly reshape the world into their imagining
- probably does not need extensive history

## Age of Creation
_1 - 4122 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The [[Age of Creation]] began with [[The Riving]], when the [[Divine Presence]] ripped away and isolated the powerful magic that once coursed through reality, creating the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Plane of Magic]] in the process, separated from each other by the [[Ethereal Plane]]. The echoes of the energy of this event, at times aided and shaped by the [[Children of the Divine]], created the [[Echo Realms]] and the [[Energy Realms]] as well. 

%% probably true: at this stage there is no soul stuff and no deities, so there are no "spiritual realms" yet. but, the described echo realms and energy realms are not all there is, and in principle, for example, some great wyrms could have made echo realms of the plane of magic, for example, or perhaps some of the titans live in echo realms of the elemental planes, or perhaps there are non-elemental energy realms that exist %%

The [[The Riving|Riving]], a moment out time both instantaneous and eternal, ended with another act of creation: the [[Divine Presence]] gave part of itself to other divinities, imbuing them with divine power and the ability to create. These were the [[Embodied Gods]].

%% stilll to decide: how this is connected to the creation of the plane of souls and the dreamworld %%

This was the beginning of time, and the creation of the [[Echo Realms]] and [[Energy Realms]]. This was also when the [[Divine Presence]] gave parts of itself to create other divinities, first the [[Embodied Gods]] and later the [[Incorporeal Gods]], and when the [[Void Mind]] was able to steal the power of the [[Divine Presence]] to empower and create the [[Three Despairs]]. 

The [[Age of Creation]] ended with the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the destruction of [[Hkar]], and the diminishment of the power of the divine spark of humanity. 

%% not positive about this anymore: This was a period were in many ways, little happened beside the events of the beginning and end. %%

At the start of the Age, [[The Riving]], resulted in:
* The creation of the [[Echo Realms]] and the [[Energy Realms]] and the departure of many of the powerful [[Great Wyrms]], [[Archfey]], [[Titans]], and the elemental powers to other planes
%% the metaphysics needs a little more thought - Echo Realms and Energy Realms are clear enough but it isn't obvious that titans who flee, or great wyrms, make sense to end up in one of those places. %%
* The creation of the [[Embodied Gods]] and their creations, the [[Elder Folk]]
* The creation of the [[Three Despairs]], and in turn, their creations: [[Thark]], the [[Goddess of the End]], the [[Endless Chaos]],  the [[Mad One]] 
   %% note: see below about orcs; possible to move Thark's creation if it should align with creation of orcs %%
* The unleashing of the curses of necromancy and lycanthropy on the world

But broadly, for the first thousand years or more of the Age of Creation, little happened. The [[Elder Folk]] learned magic, and writing, and grew, and prospered:

* The elves, while never very numerous, possessed great wisdom, exceptionally long lifespans, and a powerful command of magic. These traits made the elves the undisputed ruler of the age, and they founded two great empires. In the north, the kingdom of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. grew to stretch from the forests south of [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] to the Mostreve Hills and the Cymean foothills. In the south, the kingdom of Tinwerquë spread from sea to sea in the tropical and subtropical forests south of the great savannahs of the interior.  %% Note: Is Tinwerquë canonical? %%
* The stoneborn, even less numerous than elves, and always reclusive, do not figure greatly in the stories that remain from these times. As always, the stoneborn hid away in their barren retreats, in the high peaks, the frozen north, and the depths of deserts. However, legends of great masters of art and craft, trained by the Stoneborn, demonstrate the mark they still made on the world.  
* The lizardfolk remained largely in their homelands, in the vast coastal swamps of the southern [[Green Sea]], stretching from north of what is now the great desert all the way to the Sembaran lowlands.
* The dwarves grew quickly after they awoke under the [[Sentinel Range]], known to them as [[Labkhan]], and began to build great halls, delving deeper underground. During the Age of Creation, the dwarves were little seen to the outside world, as their underground kingdoms slowly grew to span all of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], from the far north to the borders of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. By the end of the Age, they were beginning to stretch out, moving to new mountains in the east and west and north, beginning to excavate and build again. 
* The halflings, always wanderers, spread across the [[Green Sea]], and along the coasts, although from where, originally, they came, lore does not say, and the halflings themselves do not share. While they traveled everywhere, they remained most prevalent along the shores of the [[Green Sea]], along the southeast coast of the continent, and across the great plains of the interior.

%%
Undetermined is when the Orcs were created. One possibility is that orcs, in the far reaches of the world, were created during this period, perhaps concurrently with the rest of the Children of the Embodied Gods. A second possibility is that Thark is not able to create the orcs for some reason until later, either late in the Age of Creation or during the Age of Shadows. From a demographic standpoint, orcs are expected to have a very small initial creation, a very high birth rate, and a very high death rate. So it takes a while for them to be noticed, so they cannot be created too late.

Broadly then, there are three simple possibilities for the orcish creation:
* At the beginning of the Age of Creation, totally unknown to anyone. This works from a "parallel to Elder Folk" but adds some 'darkness' to the otherwise idyllic Age of Creation
* Sometime during the Age of Creation, perhaps late. I'm not sure there are any benefits to this, unless the creation of orcs is meant to be some type of trigger for the creation of humans
* At the beginning or just after the beginning of the Age of Shadows. This would make them align with the creation of humans and hobgoblins

It is likely not necessary to decide this at the moment, until/unless we want to flesh out the details of the Age of Shadows and/or the metaphysics of orcs. The most relevant concerns are probably on the transition from "peace" to "defensive empires" amongst the elves and dwarves and the metaphysics of Thark's ability to create orcs in the first place.
%%

And yet, the [[Divine Presence]] was not satisfied. After millennia, the world of Taelgar was static. While no longer ever changing and full of the chaotic energy of the intermingled planes, in the balance of chaos and order, the pendulum had swung too far. The embodied gods had put too much of themselves into their creations, and year after year followed like clockwork. 

The second phase of the Age of Creation began in the year 1520 by the Dwarven Count, with the [[Creation of Humans]] on the island of [[Hkar]], raised by the [[Divine Presence]] with the gift of the Divine Spark. Over the next 2500 years, humans grow powerful, and explore, but the Void Mind also works in the shadows, and the Age of Creation ends in cataclysm. 

%% needs work below%%

The [[Age of Shadows]] begins with the [[Creation of Humans]] and ends with the sinking of Hkar in [[The Downfall]]. It an age of war and loss, but also the age when humans first grow, and explore, and interact with the [[Elder Folk]]. It is an age of change and disruption.

In the beginning of the Age of Shadows, a number of conflicts begin, and the [[Elder Folk]] sense a change:

* Elves feel this most keenly, and begin to shift their posture to a defensive one, building strongholds and preparing for some as of yet unseen danger. 
* Dwarves have a big conflict, those who think they should fortify underground vs those who think they should flee the mountains. The later become gnomes.

%% To be determined: What are these conflicts? The coming of orcs? The coming of mind flayers? Does there need to be a big battle or danger to trigger the gnomish schism %%

Additionally, the Void Mind does two things at this time:
* During the [[Creation of Humans]], manages to [[Creation of the Hobgoblins|create the hobgoblins]]
* Allows or creates cracks in the fabric of reality, allowing the mind flayers and other alien species an entrance into Taelgar
%% The exact timing of the Void Mind activities is not canonically determined %%

The Age of Shadows aligns with the grow and expansion of humanity, and in many ways the growth of humanity, and humanity's interaction with the non-human races, is the most important story of the age. The specific history of Hkar is intentionally left blank, although there are some events that are dated back to Hkar (in particular, the story of  [[Sarqon]] and the [[Chainshroud]] as recounted by the [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Binding Stones]]). Instead, it is best to understand the events on Hkar via the influences they had on religious history, and the migrations from Hkar (which then had significant effects on the development of other human cultures outside of Hkar).

The first period of humanity on Hkar, lasting roughly three hundred years, is best thought of as the era of personal deities.  This period is characterized by:
* Simple religious beliefs focused around the concept of each human having a personal god
* Extremely rapid population growth as humanity spreads across an idyllic, empty homeland
* A culture without access to arcane or primal magic, but with a rich and complex relationship to "miracles"
* The origin of many of the [[Primal Realms]] as the divine spark within the early humans influences the spiritual realms

By 1850 or so, the first cults start to develop, as charismatic humans realize that if other people worship their personal gods, they get stronger. This rapidly develops into a widely diverse set of beliefs that could all be characterized as "small gods". This period is characterized by a diversification of culture on Hkar, as different religious practices fragment the uniformity of the early human culture. Exactly what this means is intentionally left blank. Religiously and magically, little changes.

Around 2550, however, the first humans leave Hkar (the Northerners, in later parlance). The reasons for this are undefined and unclear, but:
* These migrants are not explorers or colonists, but settlers. That is, they do not have a lot of contact back with Hkar
* They spread across the northern part of Taelgar, bringing with them a variety of [[Northern Folk Religions]], all derived from the common religious practices 

The departure of these migrants, and their subsequent discovery (to humans) of the mainland of Taelgar, and the Elder Folk, ushers in an era of rapid change. Over the next 200 years (from 2250 - 2750)

Around the year 2500 (or perhaps a little early), a number of changes come to Hkar:
* The first cults of personality develop, which within a short period (~100 years?) lead to the era of small gods as the idea of cults rapidly develops into the idea of small, local gods. Religious ritual (as opposed to personal miracles) starts to develop
* The first migration leaves the island: the Northerners, who make contact with non-humans for the first time

%% The [[Religious History of Taelgar]] doc that I am drawing from here suggests that the era of small gods is a long lasting religious stasis. It also hints, although perhaps doesn't suggest, that the era of personal deities is a long lasting 




So the age begins with concern, and tension within the elves and dwarves. Over the next 1000 years, things grow: humans, hobgoblins, orcs, empires. 
* By ~3000, about 1000 years before the fall of Hkar, the first humans are in the mainland, and the first tentative hints of orcs, hobgoblins, mind flayers and others reaches the elder races.
* During the next 1000 years, there is a slow increase in tension. During this time is probably when the great northern wall is built, when the fey start to protect Tyrwingha, when lots of weird magical relics exist, when a lot of evocation and other offensive magic is developed by the elves, all that. 
* By 4000 you have basically the start of a century long war that ends with a partial victory for the “good guys” and a partial defeat, in that Hkar is sacrificed (my vision here is that somehow -- details don’t matter -- a huge army of evil races landed on Hkar, and that its destruction was not a punishment for human failure or anything but a last ditch effect to save humanity from being overwhelmed. Maybe to stop hobgoblin army from getting some ancient powerful magic or to stop the Three Despairs from gaining access to some kind of secret of creation).

During this time as well, the [[Evolution of Human Culture on Hkar|humans are growing and changing on Hkar]], and also departing from Hkar, in the great [[Human Migrations|human migrations]]:

* The first wave of migration, the Northerners, has started to depart Hkar by 2500 %% give or take a bit depending on the exact date of human creation %%, and peaks around 2800
* The second wave of migration, the Southerners, is canonically something that happened but also intentionally left as a blank slate. It is between the northern and mariner migrations in time.
* The third wave of migration, the Mariners, is the source of the [[Languages#Eastros Language Family|Eastros languages]] and many of the eastern Green Sea cultures. This starts around 3500 and peaks soon after, perhaps 3650 %% need to work out how this fits with the timelines of humanity in the eastern Green Sea %%. This migration departs from the western edge of Hkar, and sails around the world to the eastern edge of the Green Sea

In between these major waves of migration from Hkar, there are several smaller ones:

* The canonical Dunmari migration
* Others, potentially, to be determined

It is likely that all migrations after the second wave are culturally cohesive groups, leaving Hkar in some part as a rebellion or in contrast to the growing magical, urban, pantheonic culture of Hkar. 

## Age of Humanity
_4122 - 5678 by the Dwarven Count of Years: 1556 years _
%% These dates are canonical, unless I did the math wrong, being [[The Downfall]] and the [[Great War]] %%

The [[Age of Humanity]] begins in the cataclysm of the destruction of [[Hkar]] and the devastation this causes, and ends with the [[Great War]] and the defeat of [[Cha'mutte]]. In between, it saw the rise and fall of the [[Drankorian Empire]] and significant changes in the [[Western Green Sea]] and [[West Coast Region]], as well as the rise of the [[Dunmar|Dunmari]].

## Age of Rebirth
_5678 - present by the Dwarven Count of Years, 1545 - present by the Drankorian Reckoning_

 The [[Age of Rebirth]] begins with the upheavals from the [[Great War]] and the [[Blood Years]] that follow.
