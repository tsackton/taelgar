# History of Taelgar
This is an attempt to organize the notes and background we have on the history of Taelgar into a single document that can be considered relatively canonical. This is intended to be conversational and living, with the following conventions:

## Overview
The mythic history of Taelgar is organized around five great "ages", each marked by significant change. Some of the "ages" (the naming is still unclear) ended with violence.

In broad strokes, the history of Taelgar can be summarized as:

The **Age of Myth**, the First Age of the World, a period before time itself was created.  The Age of Myth begin with the first act of creation and are a time of the archfey, titans, elements, and great wyrms. This age ends with [[The Riving]] when the [[Divine Presence]] separates the planes of existence from each other and creates the [[Material Plane]]. This was a time of huge empires and gods walking the earth, but also of much chaos.

The **Age of Creation**, the Second Age of the World, when the [[Elder Folk]] were created. This age begins with the creation of the [[Embodied Gods]] and ends with the creation of [[Humans]] on [[Hkar]]. This is the golden age of the non-human species, but also a time that lacked dynamism. Little changed or was truly new in this age, as the Firstborn of the Elder Folk encouraged sameness and uniformity. 
%%  - 2400 years  %%

The **Age of Shadows**, the Third Age of the World, when the humans flourished on Hkar and the creations of the [[Void Mind]] grew in the shadows. It ended with [[The Downfall]] and the sinking of [[Hkar]]. 
%% 2400 - 4100 %%

The **Age of Humanity**, the Fourth Age of the World, which saw the rise and fall of Drankor, and the rise and fall of Cha'mutte. It ended with the defeat of Cha'mutte by the [[Heroes of the Great War]].  This was the first age of the world when humans dominated, and the non-humans were secondary actors.
%% 4100 - 5700 %%

The **Age of Rebirth**, the Fifth Age of the World, which is the current age. This age started in misery, with the [[Blood Years]], but then saw a return to growth and prosperity and a flourishing of many diverse human cultures.

%% Notes: These names could be improved are very much meant to be placeholders. It is also not clear who is deciding these names. The elves? Human scholars in Chardon?

## Age of Myth

The [[Age of Myth]] was a time before time and before the separation of the planes. Although it is difficult to speak of "events" in this period before time began, the key events of the Age of Myth were:

* The birth of the [[Divine Presence]] and the awakening of the [[Void Mind]]
* The creation of the [[Children of the Divine]]: the [[Great Wyrms]], the [[Titans]], the [[Archfey]], and the elemental powers: [[Djinn]], [[Marid]], [[Efreet]], and [[Dao]]

These children of the divine created many things, but all were echoes or distortions of themselves, and although great empires and cities arose and disappearing, nothing was stable.

## Age of Creation
The [[Age of Creation]] began with [[The Riving]], when the [[Divine Presence]] separated 



  

So Arha and Malik gave form to the embodied gods, into whom they imbued some of their Divine energy, the raw power of creation and destruction of their Divine Realm. These gods are also known as the Firstborn of the Elder Races: Aldanor and Elmerca, the Living Tree and the Wild Star of the elves; Entamba, the Elder Mountain of the stoneborn; Hazkunde, Bero, Udazkena, and Negu, known as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, the four Tharzen Anzinakoa of the lizardfolk; the Ruler, Runemaster, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, and Farmer, the seven Bahrazel of the dwarves; and Nwana, called the Stranger-Child, Obito, called the Merchant-Musician, and Jemghari, called the Traveler-Storyteller, the two-faced First Ones of the halflings.

  

The Void Mind had been waiting, and watching, and as Arha and Malik shaped the embodied gods and bestowed them with Divine power, the Void Mind stole the breath of the Divine, and out of itself spun the Three Despairs: Umidzka, the Empty; G’Zab, the All Consuming; and Jinnik, the Madness, and through these beings this mind worked in the shadows against the creations of the Divine. It is said that the first act of the Three Despairs was to use their stolen Divine power to embody a god of their own, and out of the union of G’Zab and Umidzka, Thark, the God of War Without End was born. Rumors other creations of the Despairs persist: the Goddess of the End, the Hopeless One, the offspring of G’Zab and Jinnik; the Endless Chaos, the offspring of Umidzka and Jinnik; the Mad One, the embodied avatar of Jinnik. Some have even speculated that the Three Despairs unleashed embodied curses into the world, attributing the curse of undeath and necromancy to Umidzka, and the curse of lycanthropy to Jinnik.


%% Elven notes

The Age of Creation: the timeless era when elves first came to the world, before the Dreamworld, the Feywild and Shadowfell, and all the other echos and reflections of Taelgar had separated from the Material Plane. The Age of Creation ended with the splitting of the planes and the formation of the echo realms, the other planes that reflect and echo and distort the world of Taelgar. (years not really real here)

  

The Age of Myth: birth of the elves; learning of magic, foretelling of the other races to come, building of great empires, coming of the orcs and other darknesses, elves victorious, defending of the great empires (0)

  

The Age of Dawn: coming of humans, the first sundering of elves (between the half-elves, who settled in Hkar, and the rest of the elves). Even more victories for the elves, wars against mind flayers, hobgoblins, etc (

  

The Age of Sorrow: The downfall of Hkar and the great cataclysm. The elven empires collapse. Many elves die, but more survive than not, just retreat away from the world. An age of retreat from the affairs of others. The second sundering (between those who believed that foreknowledge of the coming disaster would have helped, and those who agreed with Elmerca for hiding it). By the end of the age, elves drawn back into the conflict with Cha’Mutte. Ultimately a greater acceptance that the elven race is not the only protectors.

The Age of Rebirth: current day… elven society is in tormoil

%% ## The Creation Story

This is the story, told in brief, of the first ages of the world, called the Elder Days, and the origin of the gods.

### The Age of Myth

In the beginning, there was the Void, an endless space that was at once nothing and everything. Into this Void the Divine Beings came into existence. Known as Arha and Malik, representing life and death, creation and destruction, these beings have taken many other names and forms in the annals of myth and legend of the world, and scholars debate their true nature. 

  

As Arha and Malik tore through the fabric of the Void, and shaped its energy into the creation of the material plane and the world of Taelgar, something in the Void awoke that did not want a world to be, sometimes called the Void Mind or the Undivine. This utterly alien mind, if that was the right word for it, could not create, even the smallest pebble, for the act of Creation itself was antithetical to its very existence, but it sought to erase all of Arha and Malik’s work.

  

The first entities to exist in the new world of Taelgar were the children of Arha and Malik. Born from the raw magic of the world and the other planes, these were the great wyrms, the titans, the elder elementals, and the archfey. They spread during the Age of Myth, building great empires with cities towering over the lands, weaving dreamscapes of immense power, and creating echos and reflections of themselves in many forms. Nothing remained still long enough to be named and understood, and the world was ruled by chaos. 

  

So Arha and Malik gave form to the embodied gods, into whom they imbued some of their Divine energy, the raw power of creation and destruction of their Divine Realm. These gods are also known as the Firstborn of the Elder Races: Aldanor and Elmerca, the Living Tree and the Wild Star of the elves; Entamba, the Elder Mountain of the stoneborn; Hazkunde, Bero, Udazkena, and Negu, known as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, the four Tharzen Anzinakoa of the lizardfolk; the Ruler, Runemaster, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, and Farmer, the seven Bahrazel of the dwarves; and Nwana, called the Stranger-Child, Obito, called the Merchant-Musician, and Jemghari, called the Traveler-Storyteller, the two-faced First Ones of the halflings.

  

The Void Mind had been waiting, and watching, and as Arha and Malik shaped the embodied gods and bestowed them with Divine power, the Void Mind stole the breath of the Divine, and out of itself spun the Three Despairs: Umidzka, the Empty; G’Zab, the All Consuming; and Jinnik, the Madness, and through these beings this mind worked in the shadows against the creations of the Divine. It is said that the first act of the Three Despairs was to use their stolen Divine power to embody a god of their own, and out of the union of G’Zab and Umidzka, Thark, the God of War Without End was born. Rumors other creations of the Despairs persist: the Goddess of the End, the Hopeless One, the offspring of G’Zab and Jinnik; the Endless Chaos, the offspring of Umidzka and Jinnik; the Mad One, the embodied avatar of Jinnik. Some have even speculated that the Three Despairs unleashed embodied curses into the world, attributing the curse of undeath and necromancy to Umidzka, and the curse of lycanthropy to Jinnik.

### The Age of Creation

The Age of Myth came to an end as Arha and Malik perceived the world they spawned had become consumed by chaos, with little fixed form and endless change wrought by their divine creations. Drawing on the full strength of their endless Divine power, they sundered the multiverse, ripping the echo realms from the material plane, making the world round and the land fixed in form, and, some say, spawning an endless number of parallel realities.

  

The children of the Divine and the embodied gods fled as magic diminished in Taelgar, retreated to other planes. But into the newly empty lands of Taelgar, the embodied gods created the Elder Races. First, the elves, followed by the stoneborn, the lizardfolk, the dwarves, and finally the halflings. These Elder races quickly grew to dominate the landscape. They walked the land, built great civilizations, created, and lived, and died, their souls going to join their creators. 

  

And yet, Arha and Malik were not finished, and after many centuries created one last thing: the humans. They raised a great land in the ocean to be their homeland, which became known as Hkar. Humans, unlike the Elder races, were gifted the power of the divine spark. With this power, the humans were granted the ability to will into being aspects of the Divine by their belief alone. As humans spread across Hkar, and eventually beyond, aware of the divine presence in everything but without the names of gods to worship -- for Arha and Malik did not answer their prayers or manifest themselves in the world for humans to see -- the first human religions began to take shape, and the first Incorporeal Gods came into being. 

  

In secret, though, through the long years the Void Mind and the Three Despairs were still at work. The Void Mind, picking at torn edges of the multiverse, allowed alien horrors from Far Realms to leak through. Through Thark, the orcs were born, slaves to the compulsion of their creator to seek nothing but war and violence. And finally, the Three Despairs breathed life into life a new race, the hobgoblins, a race of people that would have no god, that would see no Divine, that would forsake the divine spark of humans.

  

The Elder Days ended in conflagration, as a great war broke out between the Elder races and these evils unleashed into the world, In these battles, the land of Hkar was destroyed, and the world changed, as the Elder races withdrew from prominence and the age of humans began.
