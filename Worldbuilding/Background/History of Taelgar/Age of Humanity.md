%% NEEDS CLEANUP %%

## The Third Age
  

With the sinking of Hkar, the land changed: mountains arose from the plains, hills turned into seas, desserts blossomed and forests withered. Even the land itself was shattered. New oceans cut through what had once been fertile land in the south, breaking the continent in two. In the chaos, little of the south survived, and the great elven kingdom of Tinwerquë sank beneath the waves. Old oceans also retreated, and the great swamps of the lizardfolk on the shores of the [[Green Sea]] dried up as the plains turned to desert and the water retreated. While some settled in fragmented remains of the great wetlands of old, others fled to seek a new home. What became of them is not recorded in the north. Even the dwarven kingdoms were not spared, despite their fortifications. The horrors of the underdark claimed many deep halls, and many dwarfs retreated to the surface, living in aboveground cities.

  

Among the humans, the destruction was greatest on Hkar. Many refugees from Hkar, buoyed by the Eight Divines, landed in the war-torn remnants of the dying elven kingdom of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. Whether others survived the long journey south, beyond the destruction, to some far distant land, is not known by modern scholars. But those living on the mainland were not spared the ravages of war. The cities and civilizations of the south, once the most powerful kingdoms outside of Drankor, fell, and were swallowed by the changing land. Only those humans who had lived on the margins of the world, in the far north, or on the shores of the [[Green Sea]], escaped largely unscathed, although not untouched by war. 

  

Thus, at the end of the ~ThirdAge~, all was changed, the elder races diminished, and the time of the humans at hand. 

## The Fourth Age

As the Fourth Age began, the world was a different place. The victories and sacrifices of the ~GreatWarI~ had not been in vain, and the many allies of the Despairs were forced to the margins of the world, but much had been lost in the war and chaos that followed.

### The Aftermath

The downfall of Hkar was a massive disaster. A continent sized place sank, and the main continent was sundered into a north and south half. Among other changes, this disaster dried up the central plains, which become a great desert, and created the Sea of Storms, a magically cursed area where navigation is difficult, extending east and north from where the continent of Hkar sank. When the wreckage clears after a generation or two, the following cultures exist:

  

- Hkar is gone, but the bulk of the survivors have established Drankor which is spreading to the north and west into the fertile and empty lands that were formerly occupied by great Elder race empires. 
    
- The southern culture has been devastated by the sundering of the north and south continents, and has splintered into three groups
    

- The ‘south continent’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which emerged on the southern continent and merged with Hkaran refugees
    
- The ‘south islander’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which rebuilt a culture in the newly formed seas, bays, and islands along the (new) south coast, as well as the western coast along the Sea of Storms, south of the desert.
    
- The ‘south mainland’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which forms in the interior of the southern part of the north continent; these cultures have some eastern influences on the east coast.
    

- The northern and eastern cultures largely survive intact
    
- The proto-Dunmari largely settle on the arid fringes of the great desert, stretching mostly along the north edge of the desert in the savannas and grasslands there.
    
- A new, unique desert culture emerges, with some proto-Dunmari, some southern, and some eastern influence, as well as a strong influence of the gnomes, who shelter these people during the worst of the Downfall years.
    

  

Among non-human cultures:

- The great elven kingdoms are gone, save for some remnants of the ancient forests in the ~Irebor River Valley~ and south and east of the Mostreve HIlls. Most elves who survive the downfall retreated the western forests, or the remnants of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]] near the [[Green Sea]], now called [[Orenlas]] (loosely, “dawn leaves”). 
    
- The lizardfolk scatter, some staying in the remnants of the great swamps of the prior age, others finding new refuges in the changed world, and many leaving on a great migration to find a new homeland to the south. 
    
- The dwarven kingdoms, especially those of the ~CentralMountains~ retreat from their deepest depths and fortify the dark passages of the underdark, far below the surface, against the evils that still lurk in the shadows. Many dwarves found new cities above ground, and look to growing human kingdoms as trading partners. 
    

  
  

### The Drankorian Empire

  

Early in the Fourth Age, many survivors of Hkar founded the city of Drankor on the Mahar river, near the coast of what is now called the Sea of Storms. The story of the northwestern corner of Taelgar during the Fourth Age is, in many ways the story of the growth, decline, and fall of the Drankorian Empire, and the aftermath of its history. 

#### Founding

The City of Drankor is founded in the year 4133, only 11 years after the Downfall of Hkar. Although initially a small settlement in a fertile river valley, it quickly attracts refugees who have landed along the coast of the Sea of Storms, and by 4180 Drankor is a city proper, recreating as best possible the grand urban centers of Hkar, and the people of Drankor have begun to spread north, east, and west, settling and farming the fertile grasslands and remnant woodlands of what was, before the Downfall, a great forest and elven kingdom. Fires swept across most of the land, burning the trees, but the rains were plentiful and the soil fertile, so new life sprung back rapidly in this land. 

  

By 4300 or so, the nascent Drankorian Empire stretches along the coast of the Sea of Storms, as far east as the shores of ~GreatBay~, as far west as the Nevos Sea, and north into the empty expanses of the land that is now Dunmar. Many in Drankor, only a few generations removed from the days of Hkar, turn east and south, trying to reclaim old trading connections. But the Sea of Storms was chaotic to navigate, the mountainous lands to the east the home of hobgoblins and worse, and the lands to the south torn by upheaval and destruction, desertification and flooding. So, the Drankorian Empire turned its sights north.

#### The Culture of Drankor

As Drankor grew into a major power, then great empire, a few aspects of its culture stood out. 

  

- Magic was absolutely central to Drankorian culture. The Drankorians didn’t draw strong divisions among types of magic: to them, it is all just the manipulation of extraplanar energy. Whether that is the Void via a Divine intermediary, the Plane of Magic, or the Feywild through a Archfey intermediary is of only secondary importance.
    
- Drankor, founded in the aftermath of perhaps the greatest supernatural catastrophe humankind had ever experienced, was deeply, deeply concerned with learning as much as possible about the secrets of the multiverse, and protecting its people from supernatural danger. While the strength of Drankorian magic meant that few, if any, extant human cultures could present an existential threat to the empire (they lost wars, but pretty much only when overextended on the frontier), supernatural dangers -- dragons, giants, undead, fiends, etc -- could still present real danger.
    
- Drankor was a culture of communities -- societies, secret and not, orders, guilds, and clubs, all these kinds of factions and affiliations were very common across all of Drankorian society. 
    

  

#### Expansion

Over the next 100 years, the Drankorian Empire expanded north and west, to the Myrenai Gap in the west and the southern reaches of the ~Irebor~ river valley in the north. Most of this land was empty, fertile territory, left unpopulated after the fall of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. During this time, most of Drankor’s attention was focused on the eastern borders, where a series of defensive fortifications are constructed between the ~EastBranchMahar~ and the ~GreatBay~, to provide defense against incursions from the survivors of the Armies of Despair that fought during the Downfall Wars. On the northern frontiers, more than 1000 miles from Drankor and the center of the Empire, contact and trade with the northern peoples, both east and west of the ~CentralMountains~, slowly began to grow.

  

The first war the Drankorian Empire fought was against the hobgoblins of the ~EasternMountains~, a short decisive victory, and a key moment in the self image of the nascent empire. The decisive turning point in this war was the deployment of mages, both human and Peronar, and from this conflict the use of war magic becomes a major focus of the Drankorians. 

  

However, despite a clear victory, the Drankorians did not seek to expand east. The land beyond the mountains was barren and empty, rugged unpopulated wastelands unsuitable for farming, and even the shores of the [[Green Sea]] were largely empty. The nomadic Dunmari and other desert people traveled through this land occasionally, but the civilization growing in the coastal lands abandoned by the lizardfolk at the end of the ~ThirdAge~ is more than 1000 miles away, and the Drankorians did not push far into the wastes of ~NAME~. 

#### Assimilation of the Western [[Green Sea]]

  

By 4400, the Drankorian Empire is firmly established in the lands that are now Dunmar, with fortified borders to the west, along the Myrenai Gap, and the east, along the ~NAME Mountains~. Over the next 150 years, Drankor fully comes into its own as by far the dominant power on the continent, and expands -- largely by assimilation and relatively non-violent conquest -- north along the ~Irebor River Valley~ into the western [[Green Sea]]. By 4550, Drankor has pushed north to the Volta, and east to the coasts of the [[Green Sea]], save for the fey-protected land of Tyrwingha, a few small highland kingdoms in the foothills of the ~CentralMountains~, and the forests and swamps of the Elven and Lizardfolk kingdoms. 

  

As the Drankorian Empire spread, its institutions spread as well. Most prominent was Mos Numena, the religion of the Eight Divines that was central to Drankorian worship. While in some parts of the [[Green Sea]] the worship practice of the Mos Numena changed to fit local customs, the power of the Eight Divines was undeniable, and many converted, even those not directly under Drankorian rule. The organized practice of magic also spread with Drankorian expansion. Drankorian society was both highly magical and full of membership groups, many devoted to the study of magic, both divine and arcane

  

~note added from working on timeline: this is a good point for a new emperor with a focus on . 

#### Non-Drankorian Cultures 

During the years of the expansion of the Drankorian empire, the other human cultures were not static:

  

- The ‘east northerner’ culture of the western [[Green Sea]] is almost entirely assimilated into Drankor, with only some remnants in the highlands and in particular in the highlands of Vostok.
    
- Further east, on the shores of the [[Green Sea]], the influence of Drankor is felt, but is not dominate. 
    

- In the islands and the north coast of the [[green sea]], the people are trading and interacting with the Drankorian empire but never significantly under threat of conquest. These people develop into the ~NorthCoast~, ~Skaer~, and ~GreenSeaIsland~ cultures, and especially in the far east and north retain the original Hkaran mariner cultures.
    
- Along the south coast of the [[green sea]], beyond the ~Drankor Frontier Mountains~, trade begins to increase considerably as the Drankorian Empire settles the shores of the [[Green Sea]]. While the Empire never conquerors the land to the east, and never becomes a major maritime power, trade and the spread of institutions, especially Mos Numena, is a major influence on the development of the south coast cultures. 
    
- The proto-Dunmari, a small and relatively isolated/culturally unique group, are of course aware of the existence of a great empire to the west, but remain aloof to its cultural influence.
    

- The ‘mainland’ southern culture, south and east of the desert, as well as the southern island cultures, remain far distant from Drankor itself, but the east coast and the western islands, in particular, has a bit of a “Europe” relationship with Drankor’s “China”, as long distance trade flows along the south coast of the [[Green Sea]] and across the desert from the urbanized empires of the east to the heartland of the Drankorian Empire. 
    
- The south continent cultures are left undeveloped but totally outside the Drankorian sphere of influence
    

  

#### Western Wars

After several hundred years of peace, a new expansionist regime takes control in Drankor, looking to the west coast. Although the Myraeni Gap, between the ~Central Mountains~ and the ~Coast Mountains~ was and is rough and hard land, beyond the fertile coastal plains tempt the Drankorian emperors. In 4712, the Drankorian armies march west, and in three short years quickly cross the Yerahd and reach the coast, fortifying the banks of the Nahadi. Over the next decade, a series of bitter campaigns slowly drive the Northerners north, beyond Lake Valandros, and into the depths of the ~Great Forest~, and the Drankorians conqueror the fertile coastal plains north of the Nahadi. 

  

The Northerners who live south of Lake Valandros  are to a large extent forcibly assimilated; the small gods of the ancient Northlander tradition are hunted down and driven extinct, and the people who won’t convert to Mos Numera, or submit to Drankorian rule, were exiled or slaughtered. 

  

--EDIT LINE--

  

- The assimilated Northerners, further north in the lands north of the lake but south and inland of the ~NorthernBay~, develop a culture with a mix of Drankorian and Northern elements. In most of this region, the worship of the Eight Divines displaces pre-existing religions. 
    
- The exiled Northerners form two major branches, who retain their ancestral religious traditions.
    

- Many of those that fled Drankorian rule fled west to the islands, which is already one of the more urbanized population centers of the northern culture
    
- Others fled north into the marginal lands along the Northern Bay and further north. 
    

### The Fall of Drankor

  

Then, Drankor falls, and the first plague devastates the central core of the Drankorian Empire, and causes much political turmoil across the empire. While the geographic changes associated with this plague are not nearly as great as those associated with the downfall of Hkar or the death of Cha’mutte, some significant impacts develop. First, the area around the mouth of the ~DrankorRiver~ is cursed and haunted, and the Sea of Storms intensifies, making the coastal route south difficult/impossible for regular trade, and isolating the south coastal people. Second, shifts in winds and rain and currents promote desertification on the northern edge of the great desert, driving the Dunmari north and west.

### The Rise of Cha’mutte

  

In the 500 years between the fall of Drankor and the Great War, the following developments occur:

  

- In the west:
    

- Chardon grows as a city state with significant influence over the hinterlands of the former empire. Some small tributary kingdoms and other city-states grow up, but this region (the mainland around Chardon, excluding the Nevos Bay islands and the peninsula) is very Drankorian in culture.
    
- Many small independent kingdoms develop between the northern edge of Chardon’s influence and the far north. Many of the more southern of these kingdoms are strongly Drankorian in culture, but towards the north some have more northlander influences.
    
- In the Far North, Cha’mutte’s base in Pandar grows and begins to exert influence over the more purely northern inland cultures.
    
- The islands and coastal cultures remain
    

- In the [[Green Sea]]
    

- Development of Sembara, Vostok, Cymea, etc; plus ~Irebor~ and ~South Cymea~ with a more Drankorian (Cymea-like) culture
    

- Dumari migration
    

- Dunmari migrate northwest, conquering and settling the Drankorian plains
    
- Also some move more north and east, and settle/conquer/assimilate/blend with the “non-Drankorian, central/easterner culture on the [[green sea]] coast north of the desert
    

- In south and far east, fall of Drankor has less influence and things proceed as during the empire, with modest changes in trade, communication, etc as a big vacuum is left in the west.
    

### The Great War

  

Then, the Great War strikes. The Dunmari are devasted, and ~Irebor~ is essentially entirely wiped out. The northern kingdom south of Pandar and north of the Great Lake are also essentially wiped out, more or less eliminating from the world the Drankor/northerner blend culture (what survives tot he south is more pure Drankorian, what survives on the coast/islands and far north is more pure Northerner). 

## The Fifth Age: The Age of Rebirth

~fifth age, current, just mentioned in passing here~

### The Blood Years

### Rebirth and Regrowth

  

In the current day, you have the following human cultures:

  

- Broadly, the “Drankorian” cultures, who follow Mos Numena:
    

- In Greater Sembara, the Drankorian/”east northlander” blended culture
    
- In Cymea, ~SouthCymea~, Chardon, a more pure Drankorian culture
    

- Broadly, the Dunmari cultures, who follow the Divine Siblings:
    

- In Dunmar, the Dunmari themselves, a pure Dunmari culture that settled conquered land after the fall of Drankor
    
- In “EasternDunmar” on the south shore of the [[Green Sea]], a more blended culture, Dunmari in religion but with Drankorian, eastern, and desert influences
    

- Broadly, the northern cultures, who follow the Northern Religion:
    

- The islands to the west of Chardon; the only northern group with significant population in the modern day
    
- The coastal people of the northern bay 
    
- The scattered people of the Far North
    

- Broadly, the eastern cultures who follow the Eastern Religion:
    

- These are generally pretty unified across the north and the central/eastern islands
    
- The Skaer are somewhat different/unique
    

- Broadly, the southern cultures, including the southern continent, left undeveloped, but with many strands: south coastal/island people, south continent people with Hkaran influence
    
- A few blended or unique cultures:
    

- Myraeni, who live in the Myraeni gap between Chardon and Dunmar and north on the slopes of the central mountains, an ancient people of mysterious origin
    
- The Illorians, a mixing pot culture of refugees and others from a variety of cultures in the west, perhaps a pluralistic societies in Taelgar without a dominant religion
    
- The peninsula west of Chardon, possibly just a part of the Chardonian empire or possibly a current homeland of Peronar/half-elves, still following ancient Hkaran traditions of blended cities with humans
    
- The desert people, a blend of non-Drankorian people living in the desert for the past 1000+ years, probably have their own unique pantheonic religion.
    
- The east coast, south of the eastern islands and east of the mountains, stretching south into the subtropics, who are probably an ancient civilization, founded around or even before Drankor but still surviving, representing a mix of Eastern and Southern cultures. However probably don’t have their own religion, instead follow either Eastern or Southern tradition, or perhaps another pluralistic place with no dominant religion.
