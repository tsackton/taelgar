This document tracks real-world language inspiration that we have tended to use for inventing names in Taelgar. 

# General Notes

The major linguistic trends in Taelgar are based around the following assumptions:
- Non-human species, with the possible exception of goblinoids, magically have fixed, unchanging languages derived from their creators (whether embodied gods, children of the divine, or something else).
- Humans, when created, spoke a shared language, Hkaran. Modern "trade tongues" are descended from this. 
- Local languages are primarily influenced by the Drankorian empire, and by the mariner migrations.

As far as game mechanics go:
- Linguistic variation is mostly used for names, to give different places a different feel. Most (all?) humans can be assumed to speak a trade tongue, so only venturing very far away from "home" makes communication fundamentally difficult, although of course any group of NPCs may choose to speak in their local language, and optionally interactions in "trade tongues" may require slightly higher DCs.

# Human Languages

Human trade tongues languages are driven by four migrations: 
- the early departures, humans who mostly settled west of the Sentinel Range
- the "middle waves", which may eventually represent more separate migrations but currently includes primarily the Dunmari and the undeveloped "southerners"
- the mariners, a late migration who settled the Green Sea
- the flight of the magical urbanists who fled the sinking of Hkar and founded Drankor

## Trade Tongues

### First departures
These are the cultures of the Deno'qai, and other groups now living in the northern parts of the West Coast region; Mawar and the Sembaran Highland Kingdoms have some cultural influences as well. 

**Trade Tongue**: *Northros* (tentative name), now extinct. Generally, local languages descended from or influenced by *Northros* have real world mappings to various **Semitic** languages. 

### Middle waves
The only developed descendants of these are the Dunmari, who adopted Common, so what trade tongue the middle waves may have spoken is undetermined. See Dunmari below for more about the Dunmari

### Mariner migrations
These are the cultures along the Green Sea, with varying degrees of influence from other cultures.

**Trade tongue**: *Eastros* (tentative name). Currently spoken generally in Irrla and further east in the Eastern Green Sea, although it can be heard in Skaerhem and Vostok, and occasionally other places in the western Green Sea. Generally, local languages descended from or influenced by *Eastros* have real world mappings to various **Scandinavian** or **Slavic** languages. 

### Final flight
These are the culture that established Drankor, and all the influence that flowed from that. 

**Trade tongue**: *Common, or Westros* (tentative name). Currently spoken in Dunmar, Chardon, and the western Green Sea. Generally, local languages descended from or influenced by *Common* have real world mappings to various *Romance* or *Germanic* languages.

## Local languages
Moving roughly west to east.

### Drankorian
Once spoken across almost the entire "known world" map, now considered a "scholarly" tongue only. Real world mapping "Classical" sounding, but varying between *Greek* and *Latin*. 

#### Chardonian
Descended from Drankorian. Includes a number of languages spoken in now-destroyed West Coast realms, pre-Great-War. Real world mapping: generally I have leaned *Latin* for Chardon itself, with a bit more *Italian* in the north while also mixing in the occasional other "classical" things, so bits of *Greek* in particular. 

#### Sembaran
This is a mix of Drankorian with the local elements, especially the mariners. Real world mapping: *English*. Tyrwinghan is considered a dialect, and maps to *Welsh/Celtic*. 

Generally, I have considered **Sembaran**, **Cymean**, and **Isinguese** to represent a shared "language" as far as D&D is concerned, and just use the differences for naming. Chardonian is its own thing. 

#### Cymean
A bit more "pure" Drankorian. Maps to *Spanish*, mostly, with some *Italian*. 

#### Isinguese
Maps to *French*

### Mariner-influenced languages
Common particularly in the parts of the Green Sea not conquered by Drankor. Uses a different alphabet from Drankorian-influenced languages (but more like Greek/English differences than English/Japanese or something). 

#### Vos
A collection of languages spoken in the Skaer islands, Vostok, and the Sembaran highlands. Presumably these are dialects, not separate "languages" as far as mechanics are concerned. Maps to a variety of northern European and Slavic languages, without much consistency: *Finnish* (Skaer in particular), *Swedish*, *Norwegian*, plus various eastern European *Slavic* tongues.

#### Urskan
Not much decided here, except *Russian* place names.

#### Others
Nothing really developed about Irrla, ~Eastern Islands~, Medju, MTP, etc

### Dunmari
Generally assumed to be a fairly distinct language, although adopted Common and the Common alphabet. Maps generally to *Hindi* but I've also used other *Indo-Iranian* languages like *Persian*. 

### Northerner-influenced
Generally have used *Hebrew*, *Arabic*, or other *Semitic* languages here. Mostly have assumed that there is one "Northerner" langauge that covered dialects including Deno'qai, Mawar, and others. These use a separate alphabet from Drankorian/Chardonian/Common. Or, perhaps, use the Elvish alphabet. 

# Non-human languages

These are mostly based on how they sound, not carefully thought out language family ideas.

## Elder Folk

- Elven: although several dialects of Elven exist, they are all mutually intelligible, even among the widespread elves who may be living on other continents. Real world mapping: Tolkien Elvish
- Dwarven: the dwarven language has remained essentially unchanged since the dawn of time, and so no other dialects of dwarven exist. However, when the gnomes left, they gradually developed their own language. Real world mapping: Tolkien Dwarvish
- Lizardling: ??. Real world mapping: Basque
- Stoneborn: ??. Real world mapping: Xhosan
- Halfling: the halflings' language is preserved and learned via the racial consciousness; a single dialect covers all halflings across the world, even on diverse continents. The halflings rarely, if ever, teach their secretive language to outsiders. Real world mapping: considering Igbo
- Orcish: ??. For free orcs I've used kind of vaguely central Asian/Turkic/eastern European but that may be different from other orcs. 

## Other races 


- Goblin: goblinoids of all types. Real world mapping: Slavic-ish, but may change this, also influenced by Black Speech.
- Giant: trolls, giants, ogres. Real world mapping: Old Norse as much as possible.
- Kenku: Used vaguely Sioux for eastern islands Kenku, but does not need to reflect all kenku.
- Centaurs: mostly have used Greek. 
- Deep Speech: the language of the mind flayers, and used to communicate with their various slave races and underdark creations, such as derro, grimlock, and quaggoth; also shared with some similar alien underdark creatures such as the beholder and the grell (who speak a corrupted variant form, referred to as Grell)
- Gnoll: a hideous combination of Abyssal and a magical beast tongue of hyenas; can attempt to understand if you speak Abyssal
- Bullywug: spoken by bullywugs mostly
- Low Draconic: related to draconic; used by kobolds, minor dragons, and related creatures. Real world mapping: undecided

## Extraplanar languages

- Sylvan: spoken by fey creatures, those native to the Feywild. Real world mapping is often classical Greek.   
- Shadowkar: spoken by shadow creatures, those native to the Shadowfell 
- Aquan: spoken by those native to the Plane of Water
- Auran: spoken by those native to the Plane of Air
- Terran: spoken by those native to the Plane of Earth
- Ignan: spoken by those native to the Plane of Fire
- Abyssal: spoken by those native to the abyss, primarily demons, but also some of their demon-spawn, such as Xvarts and gnolls
- Infernal: spoken by those native to the Nine Hells, primarily devils
- Celestial: spoken by those native to the divine domains
- High Draconic: spoken by dragons, the language of magic and elder wyrms

## Human Languages

Humans, lacking a Firstborn or creator god to guide them, have developed by far the most diverse set of languages among the humanoid races. In Hkar, before the fall, the magic of the birthplace of humanity bound humans together, and languages did not diverge much. Those who left Hkar were no longer bound by this magic, although all humans retain some ancestral memories of the language they were gifted at Creation. 

### Trade tongues

The language of Hkar was the language that humanity was gifted at the moment of Creation. While all humans retain some ancestral memory of this tongue, since the fall of Hkar some of the magic of this trade tongue is gone, and it has begun to diverge somewhat. As the memory of this ancestral tongue is faint, these tongues are not really full-fledged languages, and all humans speak a native tongue as well. But the trade tongues facilitate communication across cultural barriers. Since the fall of Hkar, the following trade tongues have spread across Taelgar.
  

Two, Northros and Southron, developed from the cultures and languages of early departures from Taelgar:

  

- Northros: Northron was the language of some of the early departers from Hkar, those who traveled north and settled the land between the mountains and the sea. Uses the Northros alphabet, which is shared with a number of Northlander languages. Now little spoken in Taelgar, as the northern people who survive typically speak only their native tongue, or use Westros as a trade language, and could be considered an extinct language.
    
- Southros: Southron was the language developed by the other early people to leave Hkar, those that went south and settled to the south of the great desert. Today, it can been heard throughout the southern reaches of Taelgar, including the southern islands. Uses the Southros alphabet.
    
- Westros (or Common): Westron developed from the language of Hkar in its later days, shared by the Drankorians, the proto-Dunmari, and the eastern mariner people. In 1749 DR, Westron can be heard throughout the western area of Taelgar and the western parts of the Green Sea area. Uses the Westros/Drankorian alphabet.
    
- Eastros: Eastros was a dialect of Westros, largely spoken by the mariner culture that departed sailed west from Hkar and found the east coast of the mainland. Although it shares an ancient history with Westros, it uses a different alphabet, the Eastros alphabet, and has diverged considerably. Today, it can be heard largely in the northeastern part of the Green Sea, although in Skaer both Eastros and Westros can be heard.
    

### Native tongues

The trade tongues are neither the most expressive or lyrical of languages, and all human cultures have developed native tongues in parallel. The major language groups spoken in Taelgar are the following:

#### Extinct Languages

A number of human languages are no longer in regularly spoken in 1749 DR, but are important enough to deserve a mention:

  

- Drankorian: The original language of the Drankorian empire. While no longer commonly spoken, it is still used as a scholarly language in Chardon and parts of Sembara. Drankorian shares an alphabet and some similarities with Sembaran and Chardonian. Derived from Ancient Hkaran, but distinct enough not to be mutually intelligible. Uses the Drankorian alphabet. Real world mapping: “classical” (Greek/Roman)
    
- Ancient Hkaran: The language of the first people in Hkar, and spoken by all the people of Hkar until their migration to the mainland. Knowledge of ancient Hkaran implies knowledge of all trade tongues, as they are derived from the same mystical source. Uses the Hkaran alphabet, which is also the “ur-alphabet” of all human languages.
    

#### Drankorian Languages

The languages now spoken in Sembara, Vostok, Cymea, Chardon, and many other places west of the mountains are derived from Drankorian, and all use the Drankorian/Westron alphabet. Real world mapping: Romance languages, with Sembara more English/French; Vostok more German; Cymea more Spanish/Portuguese; Chardonian more “classical” (Greek/Roman) and Italian.

  

- Sembaran: A number of related languages and dialects spoken in Sembara, parts of Vostok, and the former Isatre river valley.
    
- Cymean: A number of related languages and dialects spoken in Cymea and south along the coast of the Green Sea.
    
- Chardonian: A number of related dialects and languages spoken in Chardon and areas west of mountains.
    
- <possibly a southern language, if Drankor also spread south and east?>
    

#### Proto-Dunmaric Languages

The languages now spoken by the descendants of the people who left Hkar before the fall, and settled on the tropical and arid subtropical coasts west and south of the great desert. In 1749, the Dunmari are the most prominent descendants of these people in Western Taelgar, but they are also related to the people of the desert and the people of the southern Green Sea coast. Uses the Drankorian/Westros alphabet (which represents something like “middle Hkaran”). Real world mapping: Hindi (Dunmari), Persian.

- Dunmari: The language spoken in Dunmar. 
    
- East Dunmari, desert
    

#### Eastern Languages

The languages now spoken on the northern coasts of the Green Sea are derived from the original language of the eastern mariner culture, the people who settled the eastern islands of the Green Sea and spread east. Uses the Eastros alphabet. Real world mapping: Russian/Polish, also Scandanvian (especially for Skaegish).

  

- Skaegish: A group of ancient languages spoken by the Skaer
    
- Highlander: A group of ancient languages spoken by the people of Vostok and the highland cultures in Sembara. 
    

BASIC LOGIC SO FAR: The “late Hkaran” languages -- Drankorian, Proto-Dunmaric, Eastern -- are all represented by the Indo-European languages, but diverse parts of that language family tree>

#### Northerner Languages

The ancient languages of the west northlands were to some extent displaced by Drankorian during the height of Empire, and later many native speakers of these tongues were killed during the Blood Years. These languages originally used the Northros alphabet, but some gradually adopted the Drankorian alphabet. Real world mapping: Semitc/Arabic languages.

  

- Northlander: A number of related ancient languages spoken by the original inhabitants of the lands west of the mountains ('west northlanders'), still spoken by a number of Northerlander communities, especially Sayuna. 
    

#### Southern Languages

Far to the south, south of the great desert, many human civilizations thrive with their own unique languages and cultures. These people speak a variety of languages that originated from the original southern migrants, and use the Southron alphabet. Real world mapping: undecided but probably Asian

### Game Mechanics: Human Languages

Some additional notes on game-mechanical considerations for languages. 

  

- Can consider, if desired to make language knowledge more valuable, forcing Charisma checks (excluding those involving commerce) made when speaking a trade tongue to have slightly higher DCs, as it is a little bit harder to communicate complex ideas. 
    
- All PCs should start with one or more trade tongues chosen by the GM, in addition to their normal languages, in which “Common” should be replaced with a native tongue, below. 
    
- Native tongues represent language families, not single languages, but for simplicity and clarity, should assume they are either mutually understandable, or knowing one implies knowing them all. Hence, ‘Sembaran’ also includes the Drankorian-influenced native languages of Tyrwingha, Cymea, and Vostok. 
    

## Elder tongues 

The Elder races (mostly) all speak a single language, although some variants have arisen. 

  

- Elven: although several dialects of Elven exist, they are all mutually intelligible, even among the widespread elves who may be living on other continents. Real world mapping: Tolkien Elvish
    

- Dwarven: the dwarven language has remained essentially unchanged since the dawn of time, and so no other dialects of dwarven exist. However, when the gnomes left, they gradually developed their own language. Real world mapping: Tolkien Dwarvish
    

- Gnomish: uses the Dwarven script and is related enough to be possibly comprehensible, but counts as a different language, spoken of course by the gnomes of the desert and areas around. Real world mapping: undecided
    

- Lizardling: ??. Real world mapping: Basque
    

- Stoneborn: ??. Real world mapping: Xhosan
    

- Halfling: the halflings' language is preserved and learned via the racial consciousness; a single dialect covers all halflings across the world, even on diverse continents. The halflings rarely, if ever, teach their secretive language to outsiders. Real world mapping: considering Igbo
    

There are also some races with their own languages that are not canonically Elder races:

- Kenku?
    
- Centaur?
    

If other exotic races exist far away, they would also have languages, presumably.

## Other races 

Non-human, non-elder race languages that one might speak include: 

- Goblin: goblinoids of all types. Real world mapping: Slavic-ish, but may change this, also influenced by Black Speech.
    
- Giant: trolls, giants, ogres. Real world mapping: Old Norse as much as possible.
    
- Orcish: orcs. Real world mapping: undecided
    
- Deep Speech: the language of the mind flayers, and used to communicate with their various slave races and underdark creations, such as derro, grimlock, and quaggoth; also shared with some similar alien underdark creatures such as the beholder and the grell (who speak a corrupted variant form, referred to as Grell)
    
- Gnoll: a hideous combination of Abyssal and a magical beast tongue of hyenas; can attempt to understand if you speak Abyssal
    
- Bullywug: spoken by bullywugs mostly
    
- Low Draconic: related to draconic; used by kobolds, minor dragons, and related creatures. Real world mapping: undecided
    

Various magical beasts speak some form of beast speech: Giant Eagle, Winter Wolf, Worg, Yeti, and others.

Hobgoblin, Orcish, and Giant are plausible to find a teacher and learn in most large cities. Deep Speech is possible to learn, but very exotic (on part with extraplanar languages). Gnoll, bullywug, grell, and the beast tongues are almost impossible to learn except by magic.

## Extraplanar languages

Time and space does not work on the  other planes as it does on the material plane. Thus, each other dimension tends to be represented by just a single language. Highly magical beings such as dragons count as extraplanar in this case.

If you learn one Primordial language (Auran, Aquan, Terran, Ignan), you learn them all. Similarly, if you learn High Draconic, you also learn Low Draconic. Real world mapping: have not decided if any of these need real world mappings for consistency.
