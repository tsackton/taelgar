## Hobgoblins

Hobgoblin trade coins used in Cha'mutte's armies, and still commonly used across the Blasted Plains, Plaguelands, and adjacent hobgoblin areas (but not necessarily in the north):

- dragons: worth 2 gp each, square gold coins with a hole in the center, typically stamped with Cha'mutte's mark, or more recently a clan mark
- talons: worth 2 sp each, silver disks stamps as above
- shards: worth 1 cp each, copper disks stamped as above

In Cha'mutte's army, quarter dragons, worth 5 sp, and great dragons, worth 10 gp, were also minted but are not typically used now.
## Chardon

The Chardonian Empire has issued coins for many, many years, in five denominations, but commonly only the 5 sp, 1 sp, and 1 cp are used in daily life. These are known as Chardonian livri as a whole, with individual coins as follows:

10 gp =

1 gp = imperial

5 sp =

1 sp =

1 cp =

The Chardon mint produces relatively pure coins and its coins are often preferred in trading to the Dunmari coins or various island nation or Northlander mints. The 1 gp = 10 sp = 100 cp conversion is derived from the Drankorian empire.

Chardonian coins have portrait of the magistros typically on one side, with a design on the reverse.
