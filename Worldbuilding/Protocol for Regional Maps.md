The World Map has a continent scale hex grid, which makes the process of generating detail maps relatively simple. 

(1) Each small hex in the world map is 24 miles from face to face (~13 miles per edge). Each small rectangle 96 miles (4 hexes) tall and ~125 miles (6 hexes) wide. These can be translated to a variety of the "Adventurer Conquerer King" (ACK) hex scales as desired for detail. 

(2) My general protocol is to first generate the hex grid for the region map, then copy a png of the desired detail location as a layer, and then drag to match the hexes.
