 
An ancient aboleth, now more stone than anything else, that no longer cares to meddle in the world. Trapped in rock that was once under the sea beneath the Yuvanti mountains.
 
**Age: unknown but vast**  
**Current Location: under the Yuvanti mountains near Tharn Todor**


Introduced in: [[Ep 1 Chuul]]

The vibe was that when the Yuvanti was uplifted, some things that were in the ocean got trapped. 

Definitely canonical as I loved the idea of a crystallized aboleth that no longer cares to meddle in the world.
