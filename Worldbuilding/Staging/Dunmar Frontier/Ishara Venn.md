Ishara Venn was a Drankorian scholar of planar geography best known for The Seams Between Worlds, a systematic study of “elemental vortexes.” In Ishara’s model, at times a nearly pure representation of one of the Five Fundamental Energies can draw an Energy Realm near to the Material Plane, creating a temporary locus of contact. Many later geographers criticized the theory as folklore codified, but the work remained influential, especially as a touchstone for Emyr of Tafolwern’s broader theory of temporary connections.
