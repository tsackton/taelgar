The Heartroot is the last untainted remnant of Isingue’s ancient soil‑blessing—a living rootlike magic once woven through earth and water to nourish vineyards, fields, and families. When Cha’mutte shattered the land in the Great War, the blessing was wounded and partly corrupted. At Beryl’s command, rangers cut free an untainted fragment and fled into the mountains, guarding it in a hidden valley on the Aurbez Plateau. In its diminished state, the Heartroot has not spread as it once did, and attempts to move it risk its death.

During the Iron Fang campaign of DR 1749, the Heartroot was the true objective of the Empress of Chaos. The defense of the hidden valley preserved the relic from corruption and safeguarded hopes of one day restoring Isingue’s blessing.
