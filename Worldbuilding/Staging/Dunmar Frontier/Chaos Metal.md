Chaos Metal is a mutable, extraplanar substance associated with Limbo. Accounts describe it as a silvery, mercury‑like medium that disrupts permanence, phases through forms, and warps matter. In proximity to a shaping will, it can be compelled into complex structures and living‑like engines; far from such influence, it collapses into inert, hazardous slurry. During the late 1740s, reports from the Aurbez frontier described war constructs and armor fashioned of this substance under the command of the so‑called Empress of Chaos, with the Iron Fang host attempting to employ it in a thrust toward the Heartroot on the Aurbez Plateau. 

Scholars comparing these phenomena with ancient sources on Limbo note parallels with transmutation‑dominant behavior: inversion of elemental qualities, motion as transformation, and the anchoring of form by will alone. Chaos Metal is widely considered a rare manifestation of Limbo’s unmaking power intruding upon the Material Plane.
