# The Imperial Palace

The Imperial Palace of [[Chardon]] crowns the [[South Bank]], occupying a prominent position among the city’s many towers and monuments. It serves as the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]]’s seat and the administrative hub of the Empire’s heartland, receiving envoys, issuing decrees, and coordinating the defense and civic order.

Inside, the palace is a mix of grand, opulent halls used for state occasions, and inner passages that narrow toward working offices and the Magistros’ private spaces. The Magistros’ own chamber is kept austere and sunlit, favoring clarity and conversation over ornament. Colonnades, courtyards, and elevated galleries provide controlled movement between public audience spaces and secured inner wards.

DM notes / sources
- Gazetteer/Chardon and South Bank pages: placement among landmarks; bridges and Vigiles on approaches; Magistros’ authority over Praecanti (Primis and Vigiles).
- Session 126 (DuFr): summons by Tiberius; gate protocol requiring surrender of weapons and foci; opulent halls; private chamber described as stark/sunlit; secrecy of orders; audience content (Fausto, chalyte, mission to Chataan Mountains).
- Worldbuilding/Staging/Dunmar Frontier/Praecanti Vigiles.md: Vigiles role; public vs. Primis distinction.
- Worldbuilding/Staging/Dunmar Frontier/Pandemonium Incursion in Chardon.md: context of unrest and emergency measures in 1749.
- Light extrapolation: courtyards/colonnades and division of public vs. secured inner wards are inferred from Chardon’s towered architecture and recorded audience logistics.
