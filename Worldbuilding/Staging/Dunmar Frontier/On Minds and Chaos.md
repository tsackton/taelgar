On Minds and Chaos is the magnum opus of Gaius Devarro on Limbo, collecting fragments of poems, tales, and testimonies attributed to travelers who survived the plane. The work emphasizes the primacy of intellect and will in arresting Limbo’s dissolution: the formation of transient sanctuaries, the inversion of elemental qualities, and the inability of ordinary description to capture the plane’s constant transformation. Its vignettes—burning water, snow from devoured stone, and mental bastions against unmaking—shaped later scholarly imagination about Limbo.
