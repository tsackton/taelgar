The Iron Fang is a hobgoblin clan entrenched on the fringes of the Plaguelands. In DR 1749, intelligence from the Upper Istaros reported the clan mustering a host several thousand strong under the banner of an Empress of Chaos, fielding unnatural war‑engines shaped from Chaos Metal and operating beneath ash shrouds drifting from the Plaguelands. The Iron Fang advanced toward the Aurbez Plateau in an effort to strike at the Heartroot, the last untainted remnant of Isingue’s blessing, but was broken in the fighting that followed on the plateau.

Historically, Iron Fang bands have appeared in frontier annals since the aftermath of the Great War, often alongside references to other clans pushed north or west by calamity and defeat.
