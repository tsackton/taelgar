Pu’aatar is a legendary hidden desert city, reputed to shelter a vast library of mythic scale. Tales of Pu’aatar recur in sailor’s songs and scholar’s catalogs alike, often locating it beyond the dry canyons east of the Dunmari Basin. Whether the city endures in secret or survives only in story remains contested.
