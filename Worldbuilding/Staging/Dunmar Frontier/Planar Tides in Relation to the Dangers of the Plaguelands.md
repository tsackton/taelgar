Planar Tides in Relation to the Dangers of the Plaguelands (DR 1703) is a treatise by the dwarven mathematical cosmologist Harbek Ferrystone. Drawing on observational records of outbreaks such as the Blood Plague and the Cursed Cold, Ferrystone proposed a predictive theory of “planar tides,” arguing that the strength of connection between Limbo and the Material Plane waxes and wanes in cycles. In his model, major “outburst” events in the Plaguelands require coincident peaks of planar drift and tidal strength to “spill the banks,” making calamity possible.

The theory was discredited in DR 1720 when the War of the Ashen Horde erupted during a period his calculations predicted should have been quiescent. Nonetheless, Ferrystone’s work continues to be cited in discussions of Limbo’s influence on the Plaguelands.
