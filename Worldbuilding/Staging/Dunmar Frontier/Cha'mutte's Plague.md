Cha’mutte’s Plague was the apocalyptic wave that shattered the Drankorian Empire and left much of the Istaros basin cursed and deserted. Accounts describe a devastation that slew without regard to station, followed by land‑rending upheavals that desolated fields, toppled mountains, and unmade passes. In later histories, the Plague marks the end of Drankor’s long age and the beginning of the Plaguelands’ long shadow.
