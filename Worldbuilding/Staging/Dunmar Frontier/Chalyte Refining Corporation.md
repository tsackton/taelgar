The Chalyte Refining Corporation is a chartered body established in DR 1749 by decree of the Magistros of Chardon to centralize the city’s chalyte refining. Its board grants equal seats to the Windcallers and the workers’ guilds, with the Magistros holding a tie‑breaking vote while recusing himself from profit‑sharing decisions. The Corporation assumed control of select refineries deemed safest and highest‑quality, with profits reinvested under board governance.
