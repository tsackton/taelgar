Harbek Ferrystone was a dwarven mathematical cosmologist of the early 18th century DR. Residing in Rinburg in the Barony of Aveil, he published Planar Tides in Relation to the Dangers of the Plaguelands (DR 1703), proposing that cyclical “planar tides” modulate Limbo’s influence upon the world and predict dangerous outbursts. His model was later discredited after the War of the Ashen Horde (DR 1720) broke out contrary to his predictions, but his work remains a notable attempt to quantify Plaguelands phenomena.
