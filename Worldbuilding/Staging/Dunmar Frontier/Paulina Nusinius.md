Paulina Nusinius was a Chardonian scholar who wrote shortly after the Great War on the relationship between Cha’mutte and Limbo. Paulina advanced the provocative thesis that Cha’mutte was, in some sense, part of Limbo itself, and that at his death Limbo and the Material briefly collapsed together. She argued that Taelgar’s post‑war upheavals—including the rising of the Yuvanti and the collapse of Urlich Pass—were consistent with Limbo’s lore of ceaseless reshaping.
