Emyr of Tafolwern is a planar geographer whose work challenged orthodox accounts of interplanar proximity. In On Hidden Doors, Emyr argued that the so‑called elemental vortexes documented by Ishara Venn belong to a wider class of temporary planar connections, spanning both echo realms and elemental powers. He further proposed that planar drift—subtle, ongoing motion of realms in extraplanar space—underlies sudden phenomena in Taelgar such as fey melodies, violent tempests, and unexpected volcanism, and helps explain why permanent portals sometimes appear or vanish.
