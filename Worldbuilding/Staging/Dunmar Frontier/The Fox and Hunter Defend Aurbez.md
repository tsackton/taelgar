In the days before the Battle of Heartroot Vale (DR 1749), leaders of the Refounded Alliance gathered at Three Wells to decide whether secrecy or strength would better protect the Heartroot. Cataline Malras, keeper of old charges, cast a divination to the Fox and Hunter. The omen returned favorable, and the Alliance resolved to muster in force at the hidden valley within five days, while stoneborn allies hurried from the south. The decision unified the frontier and set the course for the successful defense of the Heartroot.
