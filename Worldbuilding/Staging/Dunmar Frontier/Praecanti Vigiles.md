The Praecanti Vigiles are Chardon’s city mage‑guard, charged with maintaining order, securing strategic crossings such as the River Bridge, and enforcing the Magistros’ law within the city. Distinct from the Praecanti Primis—the Magistros’ personal mage‑guard—the Vigiles serve as the public arm of civic security, combining arcanists and trained constables to patrol markets, docks, and the approaches to the South Bank’s great landmarks.
