The Silverflood is the principal river of Alta Tonaro, draining mineral‑rich foothills north of the Chataan Mountains. In the late 17th century DR, traces of chalyte were found along its tributaries, igniting a rush that transformed Argento into a regional center as imperial forts and roads spread to secure the trade. Production peaked by DR 1704; within a generation the easy lodes were exhausted and the mountains interdicted as deeper reserves proved perilous to pursue.
