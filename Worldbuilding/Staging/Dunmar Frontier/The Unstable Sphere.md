The Unstable Sphere is an ancient work on Limbo, already a “lost tome” in Drankorian scholarship. Though some ascribe it an elven origin, most consider it a relic of Hkar. Only fragments survive, most notably in the compilations of Marcion of Iridel. The text depicts Limbo as utterly unstable, with both matter and “the air itself” prone to sudden transformation, trapping travelers unless held in check by extraordinary concentration. Much of its argument concerns whether Limbo’s instability lies in mutable geometry or in ceaseless metamorphosis of substance—themes that shaped later metaphysical debates.
