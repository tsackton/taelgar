The War of the Ashen Horde (DR 1720) was a surge of Plaguelands horrors—ash elementals, ash‑spawn, and corrupted things from the Istaros valley—driven against the March of Andonne and the Aurbez Plateau. Frontier communities rallied under familiar banners, staving off devastation in a hard campaign still recalled around evening fires. The episode remains a cautionary marker in studies of Plaguelands cycles.
