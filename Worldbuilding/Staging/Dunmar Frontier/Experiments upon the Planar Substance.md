Experiments upon the Planar Substance is the seminal work of Arryn of Tollen on Limbo’s magic. Drawing upon apocryphal Great War accounts and comparative experimentation, Arryn argues that in Limbo matter exists in potential rather than fixed form, and that will alone binds shape and motion. Key theses include: elemental inversion, motion‑as‑transmutation, the compounding ease of further change once transformation begins, and the gravity‑like attraction of attention upon nearby substance. Though controversial, the work remains foundational to later practical studies of survival and travel in Limbo.
