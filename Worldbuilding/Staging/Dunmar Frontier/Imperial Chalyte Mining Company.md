The Imperial Chalyte Mining Company was proclaimed in DR 1749 with monopoly rights to prospect and extract chalyte in the Chataan Mountains. The charter followed the downfall of the stone‑giant tyrant in Ulgrathar and the reassertion of imperial control on the range’s northern slopes. The Company’s remit complements the Chalyte Refining Corporation’s authority within Chardon.
