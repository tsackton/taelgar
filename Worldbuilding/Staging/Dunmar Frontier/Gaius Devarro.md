Gaius Devarro was an early metaphysical cosmologist of Chardon and one of the formative voices behind the Standard Multiversal Model. Building on older Drankorian notions of demiplanes and echo realms, Gaius argued that echoes of the Riving allow strong wills to shape pockets of extraplanar space, and that permanent Echo Realms may be fully or partially co‑extant with their source plane. His On Minds and Chaos collected fragments attributed to Limbo travelers, shaping later expectations about will, form, and instability in that realm.
