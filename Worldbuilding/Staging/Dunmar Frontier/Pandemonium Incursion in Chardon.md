On the first day of Quintarum, DR 1749, a rift to Pandemonium was opened in Chardon, unleashing devastation in the city. The incursion ignited violent unrest and accelerated the political crisis already brewing around the chalyte trade. Order was restored only after swift imperial intervention and emergency measures across the river crossings. The incident remains a touchstone in later histories of Chardon’s turbulent 1749.

- “Pandemonium Scroll” note: records the 1749‑05‑01 rift event in Chardon and that the scroll was destroyed when used; initial blame fell on named mages, later tied to Apollyon’s doppelganger plots.
- Session 124–126 (DuFr): city context—riots, Eightfold Flame, martial law, and summons to the Imperial Palace.
- Related background: Fraternity of the Empty Moon (werewolf cult aligned to Pandemonium), Tokra weak points, Exile of the Fraternity of the Empty Moon event.
