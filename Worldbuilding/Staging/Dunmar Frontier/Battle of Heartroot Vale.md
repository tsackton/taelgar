The Battle of Heartroot Vale (DR 1749) was the climactic engagement that blunted the Iron Fang’s campaign on the Aurbez Plateau. The Refounded Alliance of Aurbez, aided by Stoneborn from the southern Sentinels and rangers long sworn to protect the hidden valley, met the hobgoblin advance near the sanctuary of the Heartroot. Despite the enemy’s use of chaos‑forged engines and ash‑cover tactics, the allied lines held and counterattacked, shattering the invaders and scattering their remnants across the plateau. The victory preserved the Heartroot—the last pure remnant of Isingue’s soil‑magic—from corruption.
