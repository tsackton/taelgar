Riftstone Gorge is a deep valley below Thundercrown in the Chataan Mountains. In DR 1715, imperial legions suffered a catastrophic defeat here—the Riftstone Disaster—when a suspended chalyte‑crystal turret, chained by lightning between twin peaks, unleashed a violet lance that reduced cohorts to ash and collapsed cliffs in molten ruin. Later reports identified a stone‑giant tyrant, Dhrukmir, as the architect of this engine, ruling over Ulgrathar through chalyte‑powered terror until his fall.

The gorge remains a byword for the dangers attending deep chalyte reserves in the Chataans, and for the hidden powers that rose there in the Blood Years.
