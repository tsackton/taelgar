Seva Auratan served as Magistros of Chardon in the early 18th century DR, presiding over the city during the contraction of the northern chalyte boom. A member of the influential Auratan family, Seva’s tenure saw the consolidation of imperial control over the Chataan Mountains and the curtailing of travel there as mines dwindled and dangers mounted. Later histories credit earlier Auratan generations with the discovery of major chalyte lodes near Voltara, roots of the family’s wealth and influence.
