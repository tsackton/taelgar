This is a place to drop notes that may or may not be worth keeping as notes and/or developing. 

Useful for, among other things:
- creating links to tentative / unnamed places so that all mentions can be easily renamed later
- creating links to people, places, things, ideas, groups, etc that are invented in the context of updating a page, and it is not clear if they should have detail or not, in order to facilitate backlink searching, mention tracking, etc
- ensuring things are named the same way across different pages, even if ultimately decide there is no reason to have a page for that think
