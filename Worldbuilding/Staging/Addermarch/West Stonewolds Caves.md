# The West Stonewolds Caves

## Overview
In the western [[Stonewolds]], a surface cavern served as a crude kitchen for an ogre (the “double‑big man”) and his wolf. Beyond the cookfire, a rope‑assisted descent dropped adventurers into silent, unlit caverns.

## Geography & Features
- Surface lair: butchered livestock, cookpot, and ambush path.  
- Descent: ~70‑foot ledge, then another hundred feet down into darkness.  
- Deeper caves: unmapped passages reachable from the shaft’s base.

## Recent Events (1715 DR)
- With help from [[Norman the Wanderer]], the party distracted the ogre, put the wolf to sleep, rappelled into the pit, and cut the rope to prevent pursuit before continuing the descent.  
  See: [[Addermarch - Session 07|Addermarch Session 7]].
