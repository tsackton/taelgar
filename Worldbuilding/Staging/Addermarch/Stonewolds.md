# Stonewolds

## Overview
The Stonewolds are rugged, wooded hills west of [[Roscombe]]. Thickets and drystone ridges hide narrow tracks frequented by trappers, hermits, and monsters alike. The western reaches shelter cave mouths that drop into the deeper underways.

## Geography & Features
- Web-strewn woodlands with intermittent clearings and goat paths.  
- Surface caverns opening into vertical shafts a short march from [[Fontwick]].  
- Overlooks toward the [[Highmoor]] and the [[West Stonewolds Caves]].

## Recent Events (1715 DR)
- While en route to the caves, the party avoided a giant spider after burning through ambush webs, then met [[Norman the Wanderer]], who warned of an ogre and led them to a surface lair with a deep pit.  
  See: [[Addermarch - Session 07|Addermarch Session 7]].

## Notable Sites
- [[West Stonewolds Caves]]: Vertical descent into lightless caverns.  
- Hermit haunts: campsites like those used by [[Norman the Wanderer]].
