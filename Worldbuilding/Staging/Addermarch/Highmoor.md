# Highmoor

## Overview
The Highmoor is a band of rocky hills and scrub north of [[Roscombe]], transitioning toward the western [[Stonewolds]]. Narrow game trails, hidden gullies, and sinkholes make it easy for raiders to vanish, and hard for patrols to keep the peace. Farms thin out quickly past the last pastures of [[Fontwick]].

## Geography & Features
- Broken limestone outcrops with pockets of web-laced woodland.  
- Dry streambeds and shallow caves used as temporary lairs.  
- Overlooks toward the [[Stonewolds]] ridgeline and the road back to [[Roscombe]].

## Recent Events (1715 DR)
- Goblin bandits established a trapped tunnel complex in the Highmoor, ambushing travelers and stealing recipes and goods. The heroes infiltrated the lair, rescued [[Colette du Bois]], and defeated the goblin queen before turning the loot over to [[Caradoc]] and returning to Roscombe.  
  See: [[Addermarch - Session 04|Addermarch Session 4]] and [[Addermarch - Session 05|Session 5]].

## Notable Sites
- Goblin Lair (cleared): Trapped entrance with collapsing floors and a hidden trapdoor leading to living-quarters.  
- Waypoints toward the [[West Stonewolds Caves|Stonewolds cave systems]].
