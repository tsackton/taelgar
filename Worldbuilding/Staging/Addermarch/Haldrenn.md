**Population**  
≈ 70 permanent residents (11 byre-house hearths) ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Scotland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Demographic history of Scotland - Wikipedia"), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_in_early_modern_Scotland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture in early modern Scotland - Wikipedia"))

**Three-sentence description**  
Haldrenn clings to a windswept ridge 2 850 ft above the Umber lowlands, its turf-roofed byre-houses and ankle-high drystone dykes huddled around a spring-fed well ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_in_early_modern_Scotland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture in early modern Scotland - Wikipedia")). Each May, Beltane torches blaze while herders drive shaggy Highland cattle through twin fires and up to their shieling pasture two miles north, leaving crofters to weed rye and kale strips on the softer eastern slope ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltane?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Beltane - Wikipedia"), [rrarc.co.uk](https://www.rrarc.co.uk/news/a-room-with-a-view-shielings-and-transhumance-in-the-scottish-highlands?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Shielings and Transhumance in the Scottish Highlands")). After heavy rain, the iron-rich “Red-Soil Spring” turns the brook crimson, feeding equal parts superstition and Roscombe gossip.

**Layout**

- **Crest clachan:** 11 contiguous byre-houses and St Mareten’s tiny stone chapel encircle a communal well on the ridge top.
    
- **East foot:** run-rig fields (rye, bere-barley, kale) plus two rowan-fringed orchards.
    
- **North draw:** Coire Shieling bothies and summer dairy pens.
    
- **West hollow:** coppice wood with two charcoal clamps; beekeeper skeps on the sunny edge.
    

**Economy (NPC context)**

- **Spring–Autumn transhumance:** cattle-herding families spend May-Sept in the shieling, making high-fat cheese and ghee for Roscombe buyers.
    
- **Year-round wool & hides:** Blackface sheep graze common hill, sheared mid-June; raw fleeces and tallow trade at Brantor and Roscombe fairs.
    
- **Subsistence arable:** rye, bere-barley, kale, and rowan-flower honey support households through winter.
    
- **Charcoal & plank sales:** winter charcoal burns and pit-sawn boards from the west hollow move south once roads firm, giving work to seasonal cutters and teamsters.
