# Haldrenn


Ridge‑top hill village north of [[Brantor]], known for shieling herds, run‑rig fields, and a spring that runs red after heavy rain

## Overview
Haldrenn clings to a windswept ridge above the Umber lowlands, its turf‑roofed byre‑houses and ankle‑high drystone dykes gathered around a spring‑fed well. Each spring, herders drive shaggy highland cattle up to summer shielings while crofters tend rye and kale on the eastern slope. After storms, the iron‑rich “Red‑Soil Spring” stains the brook crimson—fuel for superstition and gossip in [[Roscombe]].

## Layout
- Crest clachan: 11 contiguous byre‑houses and a tiny chapel around the communal well.  
- East foot: run‑rig fields (rye, bere‑barley, kale) and two rowan‑fringed orchards.  
- North draw: shieling bothies and summer dairy pens.  
- West hollow: coppice wood with charcoal clamps and beekeeper skeps.
 - Ridge wards: carved wooden wards line the approaches to deter hostile fey.

## Economy
- Transhumance (spring–autumn): cattle families make high‑fat cheeses and ghee for buyers in [[Roscombe]].  
- Wool & hides: blackface sheep on common hill; fleeces and tallow at [[Brantor]] and Roscombe fairs.  
- Subsistence arable: rye, bere‑barley, kale, and rowan‑flower honey.  
- Winter trades: charcoal burns and pit‑sawn boards hauled south when roads firm.

## Recent Events (1715 DR)
- (DR:: 1715-05-17) The party rescues six‑year‑old [[Rowena]] from a bee‑filled cave east of the village, then defeats a worg pack attacking the ridge.  
- (DR:: 1715-05-17) Villagers report a maddening “song” driving cattle to violence; a farmer, [[Olay]], was gored by his own bull ten days earlier.  
- (Ongoing) Talk centers on the [[Morlaith|Briarheart]] and a missing youth, [[Duncan of Haldrenn]], who sought fey treasure months prior.

%% DM: Setup for “Fey Incursion” ties Haldrenn to animal madness and a Singing Tree linked to [[Morlaith]]; Caradoc cues the hook in Roscombe (see [[_DM_/_Addermarch/Adventure 5 - Fey Incursion|Adventure 5 - Fey Incursion]]). Session details in [[Addermarch - Session 11]] and [[Addermarch - Session 12]]. %%

≈ 70 permanent residents (11 byre-house hearths) ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Scotland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Demographic history of Scotland - Wikipedia"), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_in_early_modern_Scotland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture in early modern Scotland - Wikipedia"))

**Three-sentence description**  
Haldrenn clings to a windswept ridge 2 850 ft above the Umber lowlands, its turf-roofed byre-houses and ankle-high drystone dykes huddled around a spring-fed well ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_in_early_modern_Scotland?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Architecture in early modern Scotland - Wikipedia")). Each May, Beltane torches blaze while herders drive shaggy Highland cattle through twin fires and up to their shieling pasture two miles north, leaving crofters to weed rye and kale strips on the softer eastern slope ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltane?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Beltane - Wikipedia"), [rrarc.co.uk](https://www.rrarc.co.uk/news/a-room-with-a-view-shielings-and-transhumance-in-the-scottish-highlands?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Shielings and Transhumance in the Scottish Highlands")). After heavy rain, the iron-rich “Red-Soil Spring” turns the brook crimson, feeding equal parts superstition and Roscombe gossip.

**Layout**

- **Crest clachan:** 11 contiguous byre-houses and St Mareten’s tiny stone chapel encircle a communal well on the ridge top.
    
- **East foot:** run-rig fields (rye, bere-barley, kale) plus two rowan-fringed orchards.
    
- **North draw:** Coire Shieling bothies and summer dairy pens.
    
- **West hollow:** coppice wood with two charcoal clamps; beekeeper skeps on the sunny edge.
    

**Economy (NPC context)**

- **Spring–Autumn transhumance:** cattle-herding families spend May-Sept in the shieling, making high-fat cheese and ghee for Roscombe buyers.
    
- **Year-round wool & hides:** Blackface sheep graze common hill, sheared mid-June; raw fleeces and tallow trade at Brantor and Roscombe fairs.
    
- **Subsistence arable:** rye, bere-barley, kale, and rowan-flower honey support households through winter.
    
- **Charcoal & plank sales:** winter charcoal burns and pit-sawn boards from the west hollow move south once roads firm, giving work to seasonal cutters and teamsters.
