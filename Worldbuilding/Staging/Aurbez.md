## **1. Mutual Defense Militias**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Every plateau community is bound to a **mutual defense league** coordinated loosely by the Rangers. Able-bodied adults are expected to keep arms ready, and militia drills are held seasonally, often timed to fairs or council gatherings. Each settlement is responsible for mustering its own fighters, but when a major threat looms, horn signals or mounted messengers summon the league to a rally point. The Rangers act as liaisons and strategic advisors but have no formal authority to command once the militia gathers — leadership falls to whoever commands the most trust or has the most experience for that threat.

**Historical Parallels:**

- **Eidgenossenschaften (Swiss Confederation Alliances)**  
    In late medieval Switzerland, independent valleys and small towns swore mutual oaths — the _Eidgenossenschaften_ — to defend one another against external aggression. These alliances were built on reciprocity; each community promised to muster its men-at-arms if another was attacked. Militia training varied from valley to valley, but regular musters and shooting contests helped keep martial skills sharp. Leadership during crises often fell to those with prior military experience or political clout, but authority reverted to local councils once the danger passed.
    
- **Landsgemeinde Muster Obligations**  
    In some Swiss cantons, the _Landsgemeinde_ (popular assembly) could vote to mobilize all able-bodied men between specific ages. Service was unpaid but seen as an honor and duty. Men were expected to provide their own weapons — typically halberds or crossbows in the 14th–15th centuries — and sometimes armor, though poorer members might receive communal equipment. After the threat passed, forces were immediately disbanded to return to farm work.

## **2. Local Councils and Collective Decision-Making**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Each hamlet or village cluster maintains a **council ring** where household heads meet to decide grazing rights, irrigation schedules, mutual defense commitments, and trade agreements. When larger threats arise, **regional councils** are convened at neutral sites like _Three Wells_, drawing together leaders from multiple settlements. Decisions are reached by consensus or near-unanimity — forcing compromises that preserve unity. Rangers often attend as neutral mediators but cannot impose policy.

**Historical Parallels:**

- **Norwegian Things**  
    In Viking Age and medieval Norway, the _thing_ was a public assembly where all free men could attend and speak. These gatherings settled disputes, confirmed laws, and coordinated military expeditions. Decisions were made collectively, often with negotiation between local chieftains and common farmers. The _thing_ met at fixed sites — usually open fields or clearings with symbolic stones — reinforcing its role as neutral ground.
    
- **Basque Batzars**  
    In the Basque provinces, the _batzar_ or _batzarre_ was a parish-level assembly where heads of households, including widows, had a voice. These councils handled communal resources like pasture land, mills, and irrigation systems. Meetings were often held under a large tree or in front of the parish church, symbolizing transparency and community ownership of decisions. Voting was sometimes by show of hands, but many decisions aimed for unanimous consent.

## **3. Dispersed Farmsteads**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Most Aurbez families live in **stand-alone stone farmsteads** or small clusters of 2–6 households linked by kinship. Houses are sturdy, one- or two-story stone buildings with thick walls, small windows, and steep roofs to shed snow. Families are largely self-sufficient, producing their own food, tools, and clothing. Social life is tied to seasonal gatherings and fairs rather than to daily village interaction.

---

**Historical Parallels:**

- **Scottish Fermtouns**  
    In the Scottish Highlands, _fermtouns_ were small clusters of 3–8 related households surrounded by shared fields. The land was worked communally under the direction of the kin group’s head, but each family kept its own animals and house. Houses were usually single-room stone or turf structures with thatched roofs, designed to keep warmth in during harsh winters.
    
- **Basque Baserriak**  
    A _baserri_ was a stand-alone farmhouse, often with attached barns and storage, designed to last generations. Ownership typically passed intact to a single heir to prevent land fragmentation, keeping the economic unit viable. Isolated in mountainous terrain, baserriak maintained close kinship ties with nearby farms for labor exchange and defense, but daily life was self-contained.

## **4. Fortified Waystations**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Strategic points along the road below the plateau — and at key plateau access points — are guarded by **fortified waystations**. These serve as both rest stops for traders and rally points in times of danger. Built of stone with stout gates, they have storehouses for supplies and small garrisons drawn from nearby communities. In peacetime, they act as neutral hubs for trade and news; in wartime, they become defensive linchpins.

**Historical Parallels:**

- **American Stage Stops & Fortified Ranches**  
    In the 19th-century American West, stagecoach routes were dotted with fortified stops that provided fresh horses, meals, and lodging. Some were simple roadhouses; others, especially in dangerous territory, were stockaded with firing loops and a well inside the walls. Many doubled as local gathering points where news was exchanged, deals struck, and travelers could hire escorts for dangerous stretches.
    
- **Camino Real Presidios (Spanish Colonies)**  
    Along frontier roads in New Spain, _presidios_ (military forts) served as waypoints to secure trade and communications. These were manned by soldiers and sometimes accompanied by small civilian settlements. Presidios also acted as supply depots, distributing goods to nearby ranches in return for livestock and provisions.

## **5. Economy**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Aurbez’s economy is **mixed subsistence with specialized exports**. Herding (goats, sheep), dairy products (notably hard cheese), and hardy grains are staples. Small-scale mining camps work copper, iron, and occasional silver seams, with miners moving between camps seasonally. Surplus goods are sold to traders on the road below the plateau or at seasonal fairs like those at _Three Wells_. Household craft production — woven cloaks, leather goods, carved wood — supplements incomes.

---

**Historical Parallels:**

- **Basque Pastoralism & Crafts**  
    Basque communities balanced herding with cultivation of hardy grains and legumes. Sheep and goat milk were turned into cheeses for storage and trade, while wool was spun into cloth for domestic use and sale. Many households specialized in crafts like ironwork (especially in mining districts), and exported tools, weapons, and household goods to lowland markets.
    
- **Western Mining Camps**  
    In the American West, mining camps ranged from temporary tent cities to substantial towns with saloons, general stores, and blacksmiths. Economic booms followed strikes in gold, silver, or copper, drawing seasonal or itinerant workers. When deposits were exhausted, camps often emptied within weeks, leaving ghost towns or repurposed settlements.
