# Vivian

A young town guard of Veltor remembered as capable and well‑spoken. Her death (prior to Session 28) was cited in the counterfeit necromancy indictment leveraged by [[Isabeau d'Aslain|the Baroness]]. Allegations of the party desecrating her corpse were part of the fabricated charges later disproven during the shadow assault connected to [[Malach]].

## Notable Details
- Reputation: Well spoken of among locals; the party knew her name but had not met her personally.
- Narrative Role: Serves as a sympathetic victim whose death was exploited for political/ritual paranoia.
- Aftermath: Used as rhetorical leverage during the sham trial; no evidence supported claims of corpse manipulation.
