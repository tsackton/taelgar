%% Check tim for basic question - should this be (a) deleted (b) left in staging (c) made up (d) moved out of staging with just very basic info? %%

%% This place is mentioned in several geographic notes as "near the confluence of the three fingers of the Enst" but it has never been clear if it is in Maseau, or on the north side of the Enst. 

In my head it is  in Maseau, but it isn't clear if it is even still occupied - maybe it was abandoned during the hobgoblin wars and is now a ruined city. I'm not sure if it needs to exist or be developed or if it should stay in staging or just be deleted.
