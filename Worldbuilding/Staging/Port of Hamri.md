**The Cursed Tower**  
One of the earliest ocean watch towers, built near where the Mirmir cascades down the cliffs. Today, it is cracked, and the upper levels have collapsed and are open to the sky. Rumors persist that it is haunted, and cursed to never be rebuilt, although the circumstances of the curse are not clearly remembered. Various stories are told: a sea captain's husband, despairing of his wife ever returning, threw himself from the top; or perhaps it was a betrayal by a Chardonian trader; or perhaps a money lender who lost his wife to gazta.   
Whatever the truth of the rumors, all attempts to rebuild the place have failed and today it is truly abandoned.  

_Wazir wouldn't know this, but it truly is haunted, but the ghosts are relatively easily appeased and it is used as an illicit market for gazta_
 
**The Fish Market**  
A large wooden plaza, built on stilts over the mud of the Naqit flats, this is the central market of Hamri. Each morning and evening it bustles with activity as fisherfolk sell their wares. Auction areas for the choicest cuts dominate the center of the plaza, and many market stalls crowd along the sides selling not only dried cod, and fresh herring, clams and seaweed, but also rarer finds of the sea: pearls, whale oil, carved baleen, and other fineries. The smell and noise are intense during the crowded parts of the morning rush, but by lunch it is the quiet preserve of a handful of town elders who sit around gossiping, playing cards, and drinking _walaq_, a cheap and in the eyes of many, disgusting, local beer made from seaweed.
 
By evening, the second rush comes in, and the market is again a bustling place.
   

PLACES
 
The Egg Man's Cart. A local chicken farmer, Edward, brings a cart every day into town, from which he sells fresh and boiled eggs. The saltmarsh lizard folk prize certain bird eggs as delicacies, and Trok befriended Edward when he started visiting the cart every day. The local children love to watch Trok eat dozens of raw eggs one after the other, cracking them into his mouth.
 
Trok's tower. It's unclear to most locals just how the tower was built, since it is made of very large stone boulders and appeared seemingly overnight. Most of the human sea-watch towers are wooden, but Trok's is more like a gigantic cairn, full of nooks and crannies where he stores his armor, weapons, rope, floats, buckets and other rescue tools. 
 
NPCS
 
Edward, local chicken farmer and friend of Trok. He is tall and skinny, 30's. Runs a farm with his family a few miles inland from the town. Since getting to know Trok he has befriended other lizard folk he has encountered on his travels around the peninsula buying and selling farm supplies. He is open-minded and curious, though fiercely defensive of his farm and family and young children.
 
Marty, a beach bum. Short and stocky, great bushy hair and beard, piercing proud eyes. Many piercings. Marty was born a prominent local family but is now an outcast living on the beach. He was a rebellious youth, shipped out as a teen with some "merchants" who turned out ot be mercenaries or maybe just pirates, narrowly escaped, joined a criminal gang to survive for a while in a nearby coastal city, and later returned to Hamri, hoping to be welcomed by his family, but they rejected him. He subsists on what the ocean offers, or what he can beg or maybe steal, and fraternizes with the local lowlifes.  Trok and Marty sometimes work salvage together, and often smoke gatza on the beach late at night, each seeking their own solace.
