The Harmony Stone - a huge gray and white monolith, 60 feet high and tapering to a point, with a 15 foot diameter at the base. Carved with Elvish and Northros runes, badly eroded, apparently a place where humans and elves met and traded/signed treaties of peace and friendship. Has some magical ability to share stories of the past, at least for elves, and perhaps a distant echo of the plane of the Elven firstborn.

## The Harmony Stone
 
A huge gray and white monolith, 60 feet high and tapering to a point, with a 15 foot diameter at the base. Carved with Elvish and Northros runes, badly eroded.
 
What one can make of the runes is that they are a story of an alliance, of sorts. The humans pledged, if not exactly allegiance, to live in peace with the elves, to be in fellowship with them and insure that the elves never felt the need to reject or discipline the humans at the edges of their kingdoms. The elves in turn pledged that the humans would be safe in their forests, and prosper. 

Many pieces are missing and some of the details cannot be read, especially not from the ground.
 
A deep resonance runs through the statue, though. Especially for Delwath, who carries some of both the Nortros tradition and the elves, touching the statue should trigger a vision:
 
"You see a great forest around you, superimposed over the modern landscape. Trees stretching hundreds of feet into the air, a golden evening light turning the forest to burnished copper as the sun sinks in the west. A small group of elves stand here, by the stone. They are warriors - elegant, graceful, and powerful in their confidence of their own skill and value. One, seemingly the leader, wears a thin circlet of silver on her brow, her long silver hair tied back in a braid; she steps forward and the human delegation bows before her. You can here them murmur, in a language you do not know but somehow can understand, blessing to the tanshi, asking the gods of the forest, the spirit of the eagle, the spirit of the flowing water, to bless this meeting. As they rise, you feel pulled upwards in the swirl of smoke rising from the small fire where the sacrifices to the gods were burned, and as you are pulled upwards you see superimposed on the land below a vision of endless wilds, a forest not of this world, the home of Aldanor and Elmerca, and suddenly your perspective is returned to the present day and the world as it is."
