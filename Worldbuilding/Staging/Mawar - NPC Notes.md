An old ocean watcher who lives alone in the Towers, in an isolated watchtower. Is obessed with the ocean, its moods, its character. Knows rumors of the sentient ocean, and all its many names:
 
- Yi'weti by the mages of old who cared only for its link to elemental powers
- Ur Biyiak by the lizardfolk sages who speak of the living spirit of the water that can sometimes be heard in dreams
- Wanui Teora by the great beasts of the sea who speak through the sound of the crashing waves
- Amidrayal Agura by the
- Ma'haya Kabir by Guzo the Mariner, the ancestor of voyages and the western horizon, who protects those lost at sea.
 
He knows little of it, other than it comes from the west, and beasts who spend time in its waters are awakened to sentience and consciousness.
 
### Benat
 
A lizardfolk man in the prime of his life, clean blue-green scales, wise eyes, but walks slowly and rubs his hands a lot. Has a joint problem that makes him slow and in pain, but deals with it by focusing his curiosity on mysteries.
 
Lives in a small, neat house just above North Dock, near the waterfall on the Mirmir, that has a great terrace with an amazing view. Rarely leaves his house; the town supports him in exchange for the valuable connection to the lizardfolk communities.

**Some Leviathan Oddballs**  
These folks are some of the more interesting who have been hanging around the Leviathan. They could be totally irrelevant, or you could find a way to incorporate them in some kind of plotline, up to you. I've left their backgrounds full of weird hooks…
 ![Exported image](abelard-onenote.jpeg)  

_Abelard the Singer (he/him)_, a storyteller and performer who hangs around the Leviathan telling wild tales mostly (so Wazir believes) made up. He disappears now and then for a month or a few weeks, and no one really knows where he goes. He is noticeably without visible means of support, but always seems to have coin to pay his tab on time. Occasionally has been seen to cast a cantrip or two, and is probably a 1st level bard or so. He is charming and open, but always seems to talk a lot without really answering anyone's questions about his background. He's been hanging around Hamri for ten years or so though. Originally from a small town in the Chardon hinterland. He is wickedly funny, and has a very strong singing voice.
   

_Hala (they/them)_, a traveler from [[Suhaya]] who has been staying at the Leviathan for about ten weeks. Interested in trees and forests. Often spends several days at a time off wandering in the pine forests far above town. Claims to be seeking the Fey, although they won't explain why. Has a collection of foreign coins, and never seems to pay bills with local or Chardonian coins - Sembaran coins, or even ancient coins from fallen kingdoms seem to be what they carry. Speaks only in the trade tongues.
