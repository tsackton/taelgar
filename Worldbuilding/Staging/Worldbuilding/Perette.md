The chamberlain of [[Isabeau D'Aslain]] and highly loyal to her mistress. She knows a lot about the goings on in [[Veltor]] but is shy and reticent about sharing with those not in the Baroness' inner circle.

%% DM 
- Secrets/GM knowledge: She lied under oath to try to protect Isabeau from the Heroes of Cleenseau, basically claiming the PCs were necromancers when really Isabeau was. Is potentially being tried for perjury or treason. Unclear if she was working with the lich via Isabeau or a dupe

See [[Cleenseau - Session 28]]
