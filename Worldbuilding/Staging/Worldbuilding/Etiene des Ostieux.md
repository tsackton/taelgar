%% AI Notes:
Etiene des Ostieux

Captain of the household guard in Veltor, responsible for day‑to‑day security of the keep, its walls, gates, and interior corridors. A career soldier, pragmatic and observant, bearing a network of old scars. Loyal to [[Isabeau d'Aslain|Baroness Isabeau d'Aslain]] and her fostered household.

## Traits
- Stoic professionalism; prefers solid procedure over flourish.

## In the Campaign
- Present at the preparation and arrangement of the counterfeit necromancy trial (Session 28), visibly uncomfortable with irregularities.
- Previously contacted / consulted by the party regarding security concerns and investigations in Veltor
