# The Nightsong Roots

The Nightsong Roots are a fog-filled hollow around the roots of a massive fallen tree in the [[Highmoor]], east of [[Haldrenn]]. Its hanging roots chime with eerie, wind‑borne music that can be played to open a Feywild portal in the trunk, a passage later partially disabled when the party shattered several of its chimes.
