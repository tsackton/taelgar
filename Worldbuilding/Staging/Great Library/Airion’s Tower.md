The floating tower of [[Airion|Airion Mistspeaker]] high in the [[Fiamatara Mountains]] near [[Blacksilver Peak]]. The party crossed an ice bridge, defeated guardians, solved the entrance puzzle, and explored its library and labs; an illusion of Airion concealed [[Zadkai]]. Later, Dinia reported the tower was gone.
