priest trying to restore order of twilight. based in Voltara. approx level 9. no real details about him except this character sheet: https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/46367292

### Roleplaying Notes
- Experienced, practical priest; mission‑focused on restoration of the Order; speaks formally in civic contexts.

### Secrets / Complications
- Restoration hooks: one option cites a 2,000 gp donation to Filuso or the Night Queen toward rebuilding; another outlines Hallow material costs (1,000 gp components + 300 gp donation) and returning temple silver. Sources: Gods and Religions/.../The Night Queen.md; Groups/Order of Twilight.md; _dm_notes/.../Temple.md.

### If Approached / If Ignored
- If approached with aid for restoration, offers introductions within the Mos Numena clergy and can advocate with the proconsul; if ignored, continues independent scouting and fundraising for Order sites.
