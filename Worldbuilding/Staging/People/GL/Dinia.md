>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

An elderly woman living in the high mountains near [[Blacksilver Peak]]. She aided the [[Silver Tempests]] in reaching [[Airion’s Tower]] during the arc to recover the air scroll. Later, she was captured by mercenaries of the [[Havoc Host]] and rescued after the party confronted [[Ithu'rax]], an aboleth, in flooded caverns near [[Suwi]] (DR 1748-08-24).

%%
- Arc 1: guided glacier crossing to Airion’s Tower; message later that the tower was gone.
- Arc 4: cottage attacked; sent [[Mabist]] to Voltara; captured by the Havoc Host; rescued after the aboleth’s defeat.

One Note:

Old woman, bent over, cackling. Completely not surprised to see them, but acts like she kind of forgot how to speak. Wearing huge piles of furs, with a polar bear trailing behind her. Walks slowly.
 
Northerner living in exile in the mountains.
 
She will let them rest in her cave if they want; it is warm and cozy and seems bigger on the inside.
 
She will tell them "So, you are looking for the tower, hmmm? Others are as well, yes, yes. Can show you the way, I can. Yes. The path. But I need something from you first."
 
She will ask them to kill the abominable yeti that have been killing beasts on the mountains. She can point towards its icy cave lair. It likes to knock out and freeze prey for later, so be aware of what may be lurking there.
 
She is a Northlander, and a worshipper of the Old Gods.
 
Dinia's story:  
Azzan - northlander hero
Ikos - Chardonian friend 
Fought together in the Great War against Cha'mutte, great friends. But soon after the war, in the chaos as the hobgoblins poured from the north, Chardon abandoned the Northlanders, seeking to protect their borders. Despite Ikos' pleas, Chardon did not come to their aid and many died. Now, Chardon has come back but in front of an Empire, instead of allies
