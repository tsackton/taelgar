![[perette-chamberlain.png|left|200]]




   - **Baroness Isabeau d'Aslain (she/her)**: Appointed in April 1719. From a large merchant household in Aslain, chosen by the King as a "steady hand". Is a delegator who doesn't leave Veltor much. Her brother is Girard, and she is fostering his children (Esme and Rene) as her heirs.
    
- **Victorine Rosseau (she/her) - Chief Magistrate**: A woman in her late fifties with sharp eyes and threads of silver in her dark hair, Victorine has served Veltor for decades. She is a pillar of justice and procedure who has seen barons come and go. While outwardly loyal, she is privately wary of the new Baroness's hands-off approach and the strange events that have followed her appointment. She is determined to maintain order, even if it means clashing with the powers that be.
    
- **Marguerite Deschamps (she/her) - Chief Clerk**: (As she was before being replaced) A plump, meticulous woman known for her elegant handwriting and an almost supernatural ability to recall any document, tax record, or legal precedent. While a notorious gossip, her information was always scrupulously accurate. Her murder and replacement by a fey has left a deep sense of unease, as her very presence was a sign of normalcy and order in the keep.
    
- **Etiene des Ostieux (he/him) - Captain of the Guard**: (eh-tyen day os-tee-yuh) A career soldier with a stoic demeanor and a network of scars on his arms. He is responsible for the day-to-day security of the keep and its staff. Unlike the cavalry, his concerns are the walls, gates, and dark corridors, making him pragmatic and observant. He is very loyal to the d'Aslain family.
    
- **Marceline Dupont (she/her) - Captain of the Horse**: A career soldier with a lean, wiry build and a face that shows a history of hard campaigns. Marceline is a brilliant cavalry commander and is fiercely loyal to the soldiers under her command. However, she is a practical warrior who is out of her depth when it comes to supernatural threats. The fear she showed after the fey incident wasn't cowardice, but the dawning horror of a professional realizing she's facing an enemy that tactics and steel cannot defeat.
    
- **Robin D'Aslain - Secretary**: Earnest and impeccably dressed, Robin is the Baroness's cousin and one of the few people she seems to trust implicitly. He is a gentle soul who genuinely believes in his cousin's ability to rule, but he is caught in a difficult position between his duties and his wife Madeline's growing fears. He often acts as the "human face" of the Baroness's administration, smoothing over her abruptness with diplomacy and kindness.
    
- **Perette - Chamberlain**: A small, quiet woman who is responsible for the domestic running of the Baroness's private quarters. Perette is utterly invisible, which is how she has survived. Her nervous demeanor and constantly shifting eyes come from the fact that she knows more secrets than anyone else in the keep—where the secret passages are, who visits the Baroness at night, and what strange items are locked away. She is terrified that one day, someone will realize just how much she knows.
    
- **Emeric - Steward**: An older, fussy man who has been steward of Veltor since before Isabeau was born. Emeric's loyalty is not to the Baroness, but to the keep of Veltor itself. He is obsessed with inventories, records, and the proper running of the estate. The recent chaos and the replacement of the Chief Clerk have sent him into a state of barely-concealed panic, as he sees the systems he has maintained his entire life beginning to fray.
    
### **Other Members of the Household**

- **Esme d’Aslain**: Born in 1702; niece of the Baroness and daughter of Giles, being fostered as an heir. She is an aspiring botanist and her room is decorated with cheerful dried flowers and detailed sketches of plants, a stark contrast to the more morbid decor elsewhere in the keep. She is currently away visiting family with her tutor.
    
- **Rene d’Aslain**: Born in 1703; nephew of the Baroness and son of Giles, being fostered as an heir. He is a talented artist who keeps a sketchbook of his work, including some scandalous drawings, but also unsettling sketches of a creepy ruin he found in a necromantic text in the Baroness's quarters.
    
- **Giles d’Aslain**: Brother of the Baroness and father of her two wards. He and his family are currently being visited by Esme.
    
- **Eleonore d’Aslain**: The Baroness's deceased mother. A grim portrait of her on her deathbed, likely from consumption, hangs in the keep as a piece of "extremely normal and cheerful artwork."
    
- **Madeline d'Aslain**: The wife of Robin D'Aslain. She is understandably worried about the recent dangers in the keep and what they might mean for her husband and their family.
    
- **Annette and Delphine and Mathis**: The two assistants to the chief clerk, Marguerite Deschamps. Annette is temporarily serving as the chief clerk.
    
- **A Page (Unnamed)**: A young, harried-looking boy in baronial livery who delivered an early breakfast invitation from "Marguerite" to Robin and Celyn.
    
- **Pierre**: A young guard with a wispy beard and an almost comical adoration for dwarven culture. He was easily persuaded to help Izgil rescue Lady de Brune, seeing it as a chance to be part of a grand dwarven-style adventure.
    
- **Master Alaric**: A quiet, unassuming man who serves as the children's tutor. He has a tiny servant's room on the first floor and is currently traveling with Esme.
    
- **Jean-Luc**: The clerk's valet and butler. He has been missing for at least a week, and his absence is a source of low-level gossip among the staff.

### **People of the Town**

- **Géraud Redford (zheh-roh)**: The stern, aging high priest of the Warlord's temple in Veltor. He is a man of rigid faith and martial discipline, respected and slightly feared by the townsfolk.
    
- **Marion**: A well-known disciple at the Temple of the Warlord. Unlike her counterpart Julien, Marion is quiet, thoughtful, and deeply devout, often found tending to the temple's armory or offering counsel to worried soldiers.
    
- **Julien**: A young, enthusiastic disciple of the Warlord, easily impressed by displays of power and heroism. He follows the party around with wide-eyed admiration, eager to be of service.
    
- **Primrose Merriweather (she/her)**: A halfling with a keen eye for fashion and a no-nonsense attitude. She runs the family's small but successful clothing business in Veltor.
    
- **Corrin Merriweather (he/him)**: Primrose's brother, a quiet halfling who is a master tailor. He is known for his intricate embroidery and his ability to make even the most rough-spun cloth look elegant.
    
- **Thomas Dyerson (he/him)**: A circuit magistrate from the capital with a booming voice and an air of self-importance. He is more concerned with procedure than with justice, but can be swayed by compelling evidence.
    
- **Elodie**: A young woman from Veltor, recently widowed. Her husband was driven to suicide after being manipulated into falsely accusing her of necromancy.

- **Elodie's Husband (Arnaud)**: A formerly kind man who became increasingly paranoid and cruel under the influence of Areschera.

- **Damien**: A charming and roguish bard, rescued by the party from a Duskhound after being held prisoner in the Tower of Records. He is a friend of the party and a skilled performer.

### **Missing Members of the Household**

These roles would be essential to the daily function of a keep and are prime sources for rumors, specialized knowledge, or discovering clues.

- **Brenna - Head Cook**: A stout, no-nonsense woman with flour perpetually on her apron. The kitchens are the undisputed heart of the keep's gossip mill, and nothing happens without Brenna hearing about it. She's fiercely protective of her staff and complains constantly about strange new dietary requests or exotic ingredients being ordered by the Chamberlain for the Baroness's private meals.
    
- **"Old Man" Hemlock - Stablemaster**: A grumpy, leather-faced man who understands horses far better than people. He can tell you who has been riding hard, which guards are neglecting their mounts, and can spot a lie as easily as he can spot a lame horse. He might have noticed a noble's horse returning to the stables exhausted and mud-spattered in the dead of night.
    
- **Master Elian - Keep Physician & Apothecary**: A calm, scholarly man who has seen too much death to be easily rattled. He is responsible for the health of the entire household, from the Baroness to the lowest scullery maid. He might have been treating a guard for a strange, supernatural wound or been asked to procure rare and unsettling herbs for an unknown purpose.
    
- **Lira - Head Scribe & Archivist**: A young, ambitious woman trying to bring order to the chaos in the Tower of Records after Marguerite's death and replacement. She is keenly aware that the records were tampered with and might have found a half-burned letter, a coded message, or a book on fey lore left open by the imposter.

### **Color Characters in Town**

These characters can provide local flavor, quests, or reflect the mood of the populace after the recent turmoil.

- **Olenna Swift - Innkeeper of "The Weary Knight"**: A sharp, observant woman who runs the town's main gathering place. She knows who is new in town, who is spending too much coin, and what rumors are spreading the fastest. For the price of a drink, she'll gladly share what she's heard, though the most valuable information costs a bit more.
    
- **Sergeant Borin - Town Guard Watchman**: A thick-necked man with a perpetually tired expression. He's a local boy, not a keep soldier, and he's completely out of his depth with fey, magic, and baronial politics. He's just trying to keep the peace, break up brawls, and stop people from panicking. He can be a source of information about local crime or the general mood of fear in Veltor.
    
- **Mother Sylle - Hedge-Witch & Herbalist**: An old woman who lives in a cluttered cottage on the edge of town, smelling of strange herbs and woodsmoke. The townsfolk fear her as much as they respect her. They come to her for charms against bad luck, remedies the temple priests can't provide, and to have dark omens interpreted. She speaks in riddles but her warnings are often uncannily accurate.
    
- **Isolde - The Grieving Widow**: A commoner whose husband was a keep guard killed during one of the recent "incidents." Her raw, public grief serves as a powerful reminder of the human cost of the nobles' struggles. She might angrily confront the party, begging them for justice, or quietly ask them to retrieve a simple memento from her husband's belongings.
    
- **Silas Thorne - The Opportunist Merchant**: A slick, well-dressed merchant whose business is suddenly booming. While others suffer, he's selling "genuine" anti-fey charms, overpriced iron goods, and buying up property from those fleeing in fear. He sees the chaos not as a tragedy, but as a rare opportunity for advancement and is always looking for capable people to handle his "acquisitions."
    
- **Pip - Rooftop Urchin**: A scrawny, fleet-footed child who knows the town's alleys, rooftops, and secret ways better than anyone. Pip is the leader of a small band of orphans who act as lookouts and messengers. For a piece of silver or a hot meal, Pip can tell you who went where, what a guard patrol's route is, or what was being yelled behind the magistrate's office last night.


### **The Queen's Hand**

1. **Captain Valerius Thorne (he/him) - The Commander**: A man in his forties with a trimmed grey beard and cold, intelligent eyes. He wears immaculate, unadorned plate armor bearing the Queen's crest. Captain Thorne is the very picture of royal authority—unflappable, by-the-book, and utterly loyal to the crown. He is a skilled tactician and swordsman who leads from the front, but he prefers to resolve matters with the weight of his authority before drawing his blade.
    
2. **Inquisitor Lyra Corvin (she/her) - The Arcanist**: A stern woman with dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, dressed in the dark blue robes of the Royal Magisterium. Lyra's specialty is truth. She is a powerful abjuration and divination wizard, capable of seeing through illusions, dispelling enchantments, and protecting her team from hostile magic. She speaks little, but when she does, it is with unnerving precision and insight.

3. **Sister Elena (she/her) - The Confessor**: A cleric of a militant justice-oriented faith, clad in chainmail and a white tabard. Sister Elena appears serene and compassionate, but her gaze is intensely searching. She is the unit's moral and spiritual anchor, as well as its interrogator. Her divine magic can soothe the truthful and painfully expose the deceitful, making her more feared by the guilty than any swordsman.
    
4. **Roric "the Shade" (he/him) - The Scout**: A lithe, quiet man who moves with a predator's grace, his face partially hidden by a high-collared leather jerkin. Roric is the unit's scout and infiltrator. He operates in silence, mapping out the keep, identifying threats, and neutralizing sentries before the main force ever arrives. His daggers are coated with a fast-acting paralytic poison, as his orders are to capture, not kill, whenever possible.
    
5. **Sergeant Alard (he/him) - The Enforcer**: A massive, battle-scarred veteran who carries a heavy tower shield and a menacing-looking mace. Sergeant Alard is the immovable object of the group. He is utterly unflappable, his loyalty to Captain Thorne absolute. His job is to be the wall that protects the others and the battering ram that breaks down any door—or person—that stands in their way. He rarely speaks, communicating mostly through intimidating glares.
