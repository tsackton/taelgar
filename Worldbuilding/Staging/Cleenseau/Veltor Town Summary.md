Rough notes mostly from Chat GPT with some edits on Veltor. Needs incorporation into main body of text. Mu

Excellent additions. This makes the town much more vivid and unique. I have revised the description of Veltor to incorporate these new, evocative details.

### **The Town of Veltor**

Veltor is an ancient, compact settlement of rugged stone and dark timber, standing as a lonely bastion of order against the wildness of the Aveil Ridge. The town is enclosed by a formidable, moss-covered stone wall, a testament to its 500-year history as a redoubt. To the south, the swift, cold waters of the **Auberonne River** flow past, a 400-foot expanse of open ground separating the town wall from the riverbank.

To the north, the town is pressed against the **Sentinelwood**, a dense and unnervingly silent stand of ancient trees that separates the settlement from the sheer granite cliffs of the Ridge itself. The air in Veltor is perpetually filled with the distant, low roar of **The Ridgefall**, a massive waterfall to the northeast where the Auberonne begins its journey, crashing down from the highlands. Life is dictated by the ringing of the temple bells and the business of the keep, which looms on a low bluff inside the walls, its four towers dominating the skyline.

### **Key Locations**

#### **The Wilds at the Walls**

- **The Sentinelwood:** This is not a normal forest. The trees here—mostly ancient oaks and pines—are unnaturally large and eerily silent, their thick canopy blocking out most of the sun. Local lore holds that the wood is a sacred grove, predating the arrival of the Sembarans and their Warlord god. The townsfolk hold the wood in superstitious awe; no one takes an axe to its trees, and children are warned never to wander into its shadows after dusk. It is said that the trees themselves watch the town, silent and eternal guardians with their own unknowable agenda.

- **The Ridgefall & Riverside Works:** The powerful waterfall where the Auberonne crashes down from the Ridge is a source of constant mist and thunder. Clustered along the riverbank outside the town walls is a small, noisy industrial area powered by the rushing water. Here you will find:
    
    - **The Baronial Grist Mill:** Grinding local grain into flour for the town and keep.
        
    - **The Fulling Mill:** A noisy, damp building where wool from the southern pastures is processed.

#### **Within the Walls**

- **The Gilded Quill:** A tall, narrow inn that serves as the professional hub for anyone with business before the barony. Its quiet common room is frequented by scribes, clerks, and petitioners, and its discreet innkeeper, **Master Elias**, is a master of hearing everything and saying nothing.
    
- **The Granite Mug:** A squat, smoky fieldstone tavern for off-duty guards, locals, and any rough-around-the-edges travelers. The proprietor, a formidable widow named **Helga**, keeps the peace with an iron will and a heavy wooden ladle.

- **The Temple of the Warlord:** A religious fortress of dark granite, its bells dictating the rhythms of the day. It serves as both a place of worship and a training hall for martial disciples under the stern high priest, **Géraud Redford**. Its austere form stands in stark contrast to the wild, ancient nature of the Sentinelwood behind it.
    
- **The Market Stone:** A small, cobbled square centered around a large, flat-topped boulder. This is Veltor's modest public center, for official proclamations and the sale of local goods like goat cheese and wool.
    
- **Ridge-Forged Smithy:** Located inside the walls near the barracks, this is the personal smithy of **Thora**, a master armorer who services the Baroness's household guards. For heavy or industrial work, she directs people to the forges down by the river.
    
- **Merriweather's Fine Attire:** The surprisingly cheerful shop run by the halfling siblings, Primrose and Corrin. They provide fine clothing and intricate embroidery, offering a touch of color and elegance to the otherwise grim town.
