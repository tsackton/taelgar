Celyn’s family and the teenagers compiled from previous texts.  At ten thousand words into the thing I’m working on I can see the end and I refuse to make up more people so this can be sent. :P  
  
  Mahaut: short, plump, middle-aged woman with grey hair; owner, stage manager, terrifying force of organization, disciplinarian.  Gave Celyn his armour when he left the troupe.  
  
Mahaut’s husband: quiet mousy guy who does the accounting, I don’t think I named him.  
  
Josse:  Playwright, maybe slightly mad and thus doubly Wyrdling-touched; Celyn protected him from bandit with crossbow using silvery barbs.  
  
Adri Lightfoot: halfling Bard (levelled) who supports the troupe with music and illusions; generally keeps to herself but warmed to Celyn when he brought in some particularly good mushrooms. Has combat/intimidation skills that she does not publicise.  Gave Celyn his sword with Alys.  
  
Ruby: possibly Tyrwinghan seamstress/costume mistress (but she is older and has lost/trained away the accent if so); Celyn worked closely with her as her assistant as one of his primary jobs with the theatre.  
  
Piet: juggler, does between-acts stuff and warmup stuff, Celyn occasionally would make his juggling balls glow  
  
Antonin: lead actor, more bravery than sense, got himself stabbed by the bandits trying to protect the other actors with stage presence.  Healed by Celyn. Dating Charlotte.  
  
Charlotte: trans woman actress, Celyn mentored her in clothing selection and heelped her get herbal E and depilatory treatments, after which she got vry confident and very popular; she pursued him romantically until she decided that he was gay (which saved him some awkwardness), got involved with Antonin afterwards.  
  
Alys: short, stocky lesbian acrobat, often the anchor of larger acrobatic tricks because she’s strong and well-balanced.  Cutthroat gambler.  Celyn had a crush on her he never brought up because someone being that vociferous about the merits of curvy ladies was clearly not going to be compatible without it getting unpleasantly weird.  Accompanied Celyn occasionally on trips into villages/towns if Mahaut thought Celyn was likely to get into fights or otherwise cause unwanted chaos.  Gave Celyn hs sword with Adri.  
  
 A cook, unnamed; Celyn foraged herbs and supplies to help.  
  
Assorted acrobats, actors, musicians, and others unnamed to make up the rest of the troupe.  Basically everyone in the crew has at least one backup job so while Celyn did costumes and makeup he also filled in in ensemble roles that just needed a warm body, helped the acrobats and jugglers and stage magician when they had one and so on.  A particularly organized acrobat is probably the props master and that sort of thing.
  
  
The Bettws:  
  
Hywel Bettws: Celyn’s father; a stocky, broadshouldered white man with ginger-brown hair, a skilled vineyard worker, possibly a work group foreman.  He is not much of a talker, but cares deeply about his family.  
  
Olwen Bettws: Celyn’s mother; a blonde white woman, frail, never a winery/vineyard worker, does a lot of work spinning fiber.  
  
Blodwen Bettws: Celyn’s sister/oldest sibling; a fiery redhead, assistant vintner now; ten years older than Celyn, certainly married and likely with young children at this point.  
  
Cynog Bettws: Celyn’s oldest brother; white man with light brown/dirty blonde hair, seven or years older, vineyard worker, takes after his father in gruff affection for his family.  Pursued Ffraid, a daughter of one of the Nefyn blacksmiths, as a teenager; don’t know if that worked out longterm.  
  
Pryce Bettws: Celyn’s youngest older sibling, pale blond like Celyn; he speaks extremely rarely, is even less likely to make eye contact than most Tyrwinghans, basically the classic autistic goatherd archetype.  (Might develop into a Circle of the Shepherd druid, but on Perrin’s sort of timeline unless he has reasons.)  Five years older.  He and Celyn were very close.  
  
(Celyn was a surprise baby.)  
  
  
  
The Cousins:  
  
Aunt Dilys:  Olwen’s younger sister.  More physically robust than her sister but substantially higher strung.  Works in the vineyards.  Whoever she’s married to is probably also a vineyard worker.  
  
Cousin Ilean: Six years older than Celyn, splits her time between fiber craft, fey diplomacy, and pick-up vineyard work in crunch times.  Intensely protective of her younger brother but tends to be overprotective to the point of infantilizing him because of his disabilities.  
  
Cousin Ifan: Big guy, goodnatured though he can be provoked into a fight, definite learning disabilities.  Associated a lot with the kids Celyn’s age rather than his own.  Does a lot of heavier labor that can be solved with brawn.  Three years older than Celyn, more or less.  
  
  
The Crowther Twins:  
  
Ellis and Llew are the young people from Clawyn most likely to have left the village to see the world more broadly.  The Crowther family are vineyard workers and musicians, with their father doing a lot of support for worksongs for the harvest and the winepress work; their older sister seems likely to inherit that role.  Llew prefers wind instruments and has a number of them, where Ellis plays the crwth (a lyre played with a bow).  
  
They are identical twins, Celyn’s age or slightly older; tall and slender, probably Asian or Native American in appearance?  Golden-brown skin, black hair.  Highly charismatic, both of them are tremendous flirts and absolutely partake of the Slutty Bard Archetype, but they’re never unkind or pushy about it, just generous with their affections - flirting is a game they like to play with people who enjoy that game, basically.  Ellis is bisexual and was Celyn’s childhood sweetheart to the extent that Celyn managed to have such a thing through the dysphoria.  
  
  
  
Notes on agemates:  
  
According to a website I dug up a while ago, the demographics of a medieval village of the size of Clawyn suggests about 20 people in their late teens at any given time.  Of that age cohort I have named:  
  
- Celyn  
- Ifan (older edge)  
- Ellis Crowther (bi, musician)  
- Llew Crowther (musician)  
- Idris (older, bully - thinks he’s hot shit and tries to get people to agree with him, with minimal success)  
- Gwawr (beautiful Black girl who enjoys what she can get from the boys’ attention)  
- Tegan (Gwawr’s actual beloved, loves gossip)  
- Cadwgan (potter’s son, courting Tegan)  
- Delwyn (pretty, gay)  
- Nesta (teen pregnancy)  
- Rhian (technically the next age bracket down, probably, but on the older end of that)  
  
Celyn’s siblings are enough older they’re in at least one age bracket up.  
  
  
  
Side note on a GM thing: plot happening to Celyn’s family (especially Pryce) or the Crowther boys will probably break Celyn in unfun ways, but if you want to play with backstory people, the plot *threatening* to happen to these people could be interesting
