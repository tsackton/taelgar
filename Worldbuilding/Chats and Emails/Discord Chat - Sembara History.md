I've been mucking about with Sembara in more detail, as I try to work out the impacts of this mass of undead. Not really changing much from the big Sembara document, but a few things I wanted to at least vaguely run by you...

The basic idea of the new map is that 
(a) there is a core unit of the six ancient duchies and a few border baronies (Aveil + Ainwick) which is the historic ancient Sembara
(b) this is all the lowlands ... as the land rises north and west of several different lines of hills, you get into a loosely defined border with the highland kingdoms. There are lots (at least a dozen, perhaps two dozen) baronies here, and there is no "formal border" but really a loose line of loyalties. This "highland Sembara" stretches all the way from the Volta to the Wistel..
(c) Then there are the southern borderlands (south of the Enst) and the western borderlands (west of Ainwick/Cleenseau). These are all lands that have had significant post-Great War distruption. The western borderlands were largely depopulated in the aftermath of the Great War, as the destruction of Urlich Pass changed the entire economic rationale, and refugees fled west. A small number of military towns (i.e. Dunmore from the original one-shot) remained, but the land would have been really sparsely populated in the 1580s.
The lands south of the Enst were ruled by hogoblins for 50 years in the early 1600s


[1/4/2024 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
So basically, all of the infrastructure west of Aveil/Ainwick and south of the Enst was rebuilt/reestablished during the long peaceful reign of Cece I, which I imagine was also a baby boom time. Settlers were flowing west and south to populate these new lands, etc


[1/4/2024 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
The far western baronies (Dunfry/Usbourg/Enford/Bronva) were explicitly establised by Cece as military districts, although by 1748 the direct military relationship has probably faded, especially in Dunfry and Usbourg


[1/4/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
The southern baronies (I have 5 but might expand to 6 or 7) were all new grants, also by Cece, largely to loyalists from the wars. That section (between the Enst and Adderfell) is probably decent farmland, it was just ravaged by hobgoblins and war. So it is probably somewhat booming these days, lots of growth


[1/4/2024 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
historically, Maseau and Adderfell were never part of "historic" Sembara. Maseau was established by Derik I after his defeat of Atavas, as basically new land,


[1/4/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
Adderfell I think has always had close ties with Tyrwingha, and is probably only not part of Tyrwingha because the Tyrwinghan borders are set by Ethlenn for mysterious reasons and she doesn't want it -- although it is likely somewhat congruent with her kingdom.


[1/4/2024 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
For a long time the earls of Adderfell probably looked to Tyrwingha for direction, and they only gradually came into the Sembaran orbit after Derik became king of Tyrwingha. But probably in some formal sense, it has never been "ruled" by Sembara in the sense that its always been an allied state, not a specific and direct place ruled by the monarch, so to speak


[1/4/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this all basically works. one thing to think about is who exactly are the people living in these places? I've been reading the Great Sea again (the Mediterranean book I started in Nantucket, but I got bored after the fall of Rome and put it aside for a while until recently), and one thing that is really clear from this, which is probably obvious but perhaps isn't incorporated enough into Taelgar worldbuilding, is that you have these big empires that expand and contract across the Mediterranean over 600 years, but for the most part, the people don't move around (with some exceptions like medieval spain and some trade colonies)


[1/4/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
so I guess I would think a bit about what the cultures are here


[1/4/2024 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
Well, that's part of why I want the Great War to have been so depopulating


[1/4/2024 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, you have refugee movements and resettlement too


[1/4/2024 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
I think basically there are two ancient cultures here -- the highland culture and the lowland culture, which spread up the river valleys


[1/4/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
Within the lowland culture (which is the core of Sembara today) you have a Tyrwinghan variant, which isn't hugely different, but has some unique strains via the fey connection


[1/4/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
Maseau is always been a bit of a marginal borderland.


[1/4/2024 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I would think Maseau would have been fairly rich Drankorian province, if only by nearby association with Isingue


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm, maybe


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but probably no need to go back that far, really


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like the land is less fertile.


[1/4/2024 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
The southern part of Maseau, probably. The northern section south of the Enst is kinda marginal farmland, compared to more eastern Sembara


[1/4/2024 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
But also, ignoring that far back


[1/4/2024 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
Start with Atavas, say


[1/4/2024 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
The whole area between Insingue and Sembara is under hobgoblin rule for some time. They probably don't kill everyone, but you would imagine that as being pretty disruptive


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, and at that point for a while it probably feels like Sembara is pretty cut off


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
insignue is still connected to Dunmar-Chardon trade routes and the Green Sea via Orenlas / Cymea / "South Cymea"


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[1/4/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
And I suspect a lot of refugee flows *south* during the Atavas wars


[1/4/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that would make sense - this is also the height of Dunmar's military power


[1/4/2024 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right, so that seems like a safer bet. But Derik is the one who actually defeats Atavas, and has an upper hand at reestablishing the human kingdoms in the region


[1/4/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Isingue is closer to Kharsan than Tokra to Kharsan, for example


[1/4/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
So he finds someone suitable, makes them a Duke and gets them to pledge feudal loyalty to him, and so a somewhat depopulated Maseau - which its own more Insinguen culture somewhat distinct from Sembara gets incorporated into the kingdom


[1/4/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
So at the eve of the Great War you have basically 5 cultures in Sembara:

* The highland culture
* The lowland culture, which spreads all the way to the mountains along the Enst
* The Tyringhan vairnt of the lowland culture, also in Adderfell
* The Maseau culture, kinda weakened/depopulated
* The northern/Tollen-influenced culture which is another variant of Sembaran, but basically not too different, along the Volta


[1/4/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right I was just typing exactly same thing but slower


[1/4/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
politically, the lowland culture is very dominant at this point, as well


[1/4/2024 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of fell like Tyrwingha is a bit more diverged than this makes it seem, though. by the time of the Great War, the Tyrwinghans have been living under the protection of the fey for ~1000 years


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i would think that would not be a minor influence


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but part of Drankor


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
But yeah, actually, I have been playing in my game Tyrwingha has more different than "a variant"


[1/4/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
My player with a Tyrinwghan PC has a tendency to play her character as "somewhat foreign, why do these Sembarans do things weird" which I have not discourged


[1/4/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
but I think it works with the above, i.e. Tyrwingha probably feels pretty different. The unification of the two realms has always been a personal union of crowns, not some kind of real "single country"


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so then you have Great War, west is upended, plaguelands, all that


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right. And then in the early 1600s everything south of the Enst is ruled by hobgoblins for 50 years


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
almost


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
40-something


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
at this point everyone who survives is basically just pledging themselves to Derik III in desperation


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
Right, although Sembara also is abandoning people left and right


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
after Derik III dies though


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/4/2024 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so at that point I think there is room for a bit more complex set of loyalities and obligations that doesn't result in Sembara just being one big country in a modern sense


[1/4/2024 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
you already have personal union of crowns that joins Sembara and Tyrwingha


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but for example adderfell can have relatively shifting loyalities


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah - although I think Adderfell has been more of a Tyrwinghan than Sembaran allied state


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
historically


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
then of course this motivates Cece I to install loyalists in the newly created duchies / marches


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think a lot of places perhaps have more of a feel of "the Barony of Aveil" than "Sembara", wouldn't they?


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
Well, I think that changed during Cece's reign


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
it was 60-ish years of peace and prosperity


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
everyone loved her


[1/4/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
Well, let me think it through


[1/4/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean my sense historically is that it often was not very important to the people of random place X whether their lord owed alliegance to the king of france or the king of england, except insomuch as it meant they might be killed fighting in a war


[1/4/2024 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
It seems like at the beginning of Cece's reign, you have:

* Maseau, which has been separated from Sembara by a hobgoblin kingdom for 50 years and also has had its own influx of refugees and challenges on its southern border
* Adderfell, which is also separated from Sembara by hobgoblins, and probably heavily dependent on the Tyrwinghan knights for aid which stuff gets bad
* Tyrwingha, which has only been recently rejoined with the Sembaran crown and which has a pretty distinct culture at this point


[1/4/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
* The highlands, which really are a place of shifting loyalties, where the "border" is kinda meaningless, and some local lord might be loyal to the monarch of Ardlas rather than Sembara, and which might feel very much like the "barony of whatever" rather than sembara or ardlas specifically


[1/4/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
* The core ancient duchies, which I think includes Aveil and Ainwick (although they were historically the border baronies and loyal to the Duke of Wisford)


[1/4/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
* The western military baronies, still very much army camps and frontier, not so many people


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the bigger worldbuilding question is: given all the danger out there, and magic, and the gods, do humans actually regularly fight wars of conquest?


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
No, I think probably not


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think I agree


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, sometimes things happen - i.e. Chardon + Dunmar. But you don't have stuff like the Norman Conquest of England that often


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm thinking about the approximately 1000 wars fought over siciliy, for example


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
you could imagine a scenario where northern cymea is constantly changing hands to control the straights


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
or the long term war between the english and french kings over france


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the question then is, the absence of wars of conquest, what changes alliegance? i think generally there would be a very strong incentive to be allied with someone bigger


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is a feeling of safety


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example most of the Drankorian conquest of Sembara isn't really a war. it is "we have a huge army and a million wizards" and the sembarans going "awesome come stay"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Sure


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Although there are exceptions, i.e. the highlanders


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right, obviously


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it *all* has to be "no war conquest"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
no, of course not, but a lot less than in the real world


[1/4/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, agreed


[1/4/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but I actually think that means you tend to have a bit more local identity, e.g. Barony of Aveil is not not-Sembaran, exactly - the people who live there are largely Sembaran in culture


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
and while through long ties of alliance and culture, Aveil is always looking to Sembara first, Sembara probably wouldn't march knights on them if the next Baron refused to swear alliegance to the king


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
they might, of course


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but it would be far from a guarantee


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think that is true


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, if an upstart knight in Cleenseau declares himself king of the river lands, the Baron of Aveil almost certainly is marching knights against him, I would think


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
Although I think its a bit more complicated than that


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the " long ties of alliance and culture" elides a lot, yes


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but, it would be a reason why the lich would imagine this plan could work


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think the Baron of Aveil is a bad example only because I have in my mind that it has ancient ties to the Duchy of Wisford


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
The big duchies are a better example


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
But yes, I agree


[1/4/2024 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
I think at some level, the lich is trying to get the six duchies to each one declare indepedence from Sembara and destroy the sembaran crown that way


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
The first step is to get Wisford, which I think is one of the most powerful duchies, to suceed


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
I think an interesting historical model is actually in a way the early modern Spanish crown


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right with land and stuff all over the place?


[1/4/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
no I was thinking you have castile, aragon, etc


[1/4/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
they are unified and all owe allegiance to the same king but also you have powerful local power bases


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
right before the hapsburgs


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
like 1500s


[1/4/2024 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus

Composite monarchy
A composite monarchy (or composite state) is a historical category, introduced by H. G. Koenigsberger in 1975 and popularised by Sir John H. Elliott, that describes early modern states consisting of several countries under one ruler, sometimes designated as a personal union, who governs his territories as if they were separate kingdoms, in accor...


[1/4/2024 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right although I dont actually want to make up 6 different sets of taxes and laws and such 🙂


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right I wouldn't go to that extreme


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
you just need vibes


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
basically the point is the Duke of Wisford is an important person with independent power


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
And in fact, in a weird position right now, because their historic influence over the southern Enst border has waned significantly


[1/4/2024 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
Because after Wisford bore the brunt of the Shattered Ice Clan attacks, and then Cece's resettlement was focused on crown loyalists


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
And actually I have it in my plan that the baron of Aveil is actually working for the lich or controlled by the lich or something


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
Which works really well to isolate Wisford


[1/4/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
And then, on top of that:
* Wisford has close ties to the lizardfolk of Ozabal Swamp
* Fellburn was a center of a lot of battles, so there are a lot of dead. It is going to suffer a lot more form the raise 0.5% of dead than many places


[1/4/2024 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, I agree with all of that


[1/4/2024 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
The other point I was going for in my thinking above is that the southern and western baronies are basically "new" from Cece's reign


[1/4/2024 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
And the southern borderlands in particular have grown a lot - good farmland then, and a sense of economic possibilities..


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think those baronies would have largely (entirely?) been personal possessions of the crown


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
whether that is still true in 1750 can be an open question


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, after reconquest, for sure


[1/4/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
But I think Cece gifted a lot of of them out


[1/4/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
And probably in the chaos after the lich dies Wisford gets back some level of control


[1/4/2024 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
especially because the next queen is Elaine II who is strongly Tyrwinghan


[1/4/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
and so I think in 1750, its more balanced -- the crown has more wealth and resources partly from an expanded royal demense in the south, but also at least some of the barons are currently back in the Wisford orbit


[1/4/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure it matters much, its all a peaceful land these days. The action is in Adderfell / March of Andonne / Aurbez


[1/4/2024 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I was thinking Maseau might have gained at the expense of Wisford


[1/4/2024 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that is possible as well


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway doesn't really matter for now


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
Oh, one last thought -- I'm trying to figure out when the western wall was built


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking maybe recently -- during Cece's reign, by dwarves, with some magical assistance from Tollen


[1/4/2024 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that works. I am pretty sure I explicitly imagined the wall was *not* there for the stone titan one shot


[1/4/2024 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and then it wouldn't have really made sense as a place to build a wall during the hobgoblin occupation


[1/4/2024 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so I would probably put it ~1660-1670


[1/4/2024 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also make it more magical


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
it is not just with the help of dwarves, it is with the help of stone giants


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
or something like that


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
or earth elementals


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
right, I like elementals more than stone giants. But yeah, good point


[1/4/2024 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
it might not really matter exactly. maybe there are lots of rumors


[1/4/2024 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe cece found a ring of three wishes and wished for a wall


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
ooh, I like that


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
maybe Cece stole a ring of three wishs from the lich


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
before he was a lich


[1/4/2024 10:18 PM] rsulfuratus
only potential flavor issue there is a ring of three wishes is about as arcane magic as arcane magic gets


[1/4/2024 10:18 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, true


[1/4/2024 10:19 PM] .deciusmus
although maybe it was Cece's secret


[1/5/2024 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a image that I might use as a emblem for Avatus:

assets/avatus-symbol-sketch.png


[1/5/2024 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
Any concerns? This is coming up in my game via some undead warriors ressurected from battlefields of the Atavus wars


[1/5/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
looks fine to me


[1/5/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Working more on my Dunmar page. Trying to model a bit on Wikipedia with say a short section on “politics” and then a link to a longer page as needed as I feel like it is kind of a lot to have 1000 words on Dunmari politics if you just want a quick overview


[1/5/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
“Expanded” notes for geography, religion, and history have obvious homes


[1/5/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
But eg politics, culture, economy and trade, justice/law don’t right now


[1/5/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking about the same issues for Sembara, i.e. tax law is going to be relevant in the session after next, I was going to try to pull togeher some notes but was't sure where to put it


[1/5/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
For now I’m thinking about just leaving in gazetteer


[1/5/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to suggest the same


[1/5/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, going back to the Highland Kingdoms name, I was going to make a obsidian change for a new tenative name...

Do you prefer 

Zimka (people)/Zimkovia (place) 
Pemvos (people)/Pemvora (place)


[1/5/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
Not necessarily final, but I want to start using something oher than highlands in other stuff about sembara region


[1/5/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
Although I like Zimka / Zimkovia (or Zimkova), Zovcka is probably too similar, so would probably need to change


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, Zovcka is the place that sees itself as "the true home" of the Zimka people


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
hence the similarity of name


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, maybe a little too confusing in actual game but I think it works from a worldbuilding perspective


[1/5/2024 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
eh I'm not really sold, I think the names are kind of in an uncanny valley where they are close enough that you confuse them but not so close as to be obviously from the same root


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure why you couldn't just change the name of Zovcka, as far as I know it has never come up in any game


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
yeah you might be right


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, changing Zovcka is no problem

The term "highlander" has come up a few times in my game but I don't have any issue just changing it, it is just background color. And none of the kingdom names matter


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
honestly I'm not even sure Zovcka is a kingdom


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
highlander is just what the sembarans call the Zimka


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
But it came up because one of the players speaks Zimka, but again, no issue just telling him I renamed the languag


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly I might just erase Zovcka for now


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
why does there have to be a specific name for the Zimka people north of Breva that were never controlled by Sembara?


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
(rhetorical question)


[1/5/2024 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
Actually the more I think about that I like it because naming it as a "kingdom" kinda guides the mind in a certain direction, and I'm not sure the Zimka really have the same concept of kingship as the sembaras


[1/5/2024 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
I’m working a bit on land tenure in Sembara, and based on our previous conversation, rethinking a bit about how it grew outside the original six duchies.


[1/5/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
The original timeline I wrote imagined a series of conquests but that doesn’t really feel right


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
Who was living in these places after the fall of Drankor? I’m not really sure.


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
That said the Great War depopulated a lot of it so maybe it doesn’t matter


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think I'd bother to write much of that old history


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that was the conclusion I was coming to


[1/5/2024 1:35 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing that is obvious after revisiting my old dunmar notes is that while I had some good bones of things, there is a lot in the old google docs that turned out to be wrong after playing a game in dunmar for 3 years, and it is a lot easier now to write up a good dunmar page. 

so I'm kind of inclined to be a little careful over-inventing stuff - or at least committing to stuff as canon - too early


[1/5/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a complete draft of my rewritten Dunmar note, curious if you have any feedback, especially on organization


[1/5/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
subnotes are not generally done, or are just notes


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I'm looking at dunmar


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a note on land holding in sembara that I'd appreciate thoughts on


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
largely based on medieval england and the complexity of French/Normal law vs Anglo-Saxon law


[1/5/2024 3:27 PM] .deciusmus
I like the organization a lot
