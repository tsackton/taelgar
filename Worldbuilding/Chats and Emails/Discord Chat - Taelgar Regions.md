This discussion is hard to follow without maps, which are not imported here. Largely serves as background for decisions about regions in Regions of Taelgar and is probably not that useful at this stage except as a record.

just pushed a rewrite/update of regions in taelgar

I'm reading that. I think you are right that moving Vostok + Cymean to Western Green Sea would make sense; I also think you wanted Cymea to be somewhat intentionally blank? to preserve for a potential future campaign or miniseries?

It feels like the kind of place that should be developed for a larger purpose than "passing through?
Deciusmus — Today at 1:18 PM
I wonder if it would make more sense to consider:

(a)
Image
i.e. #1 - Greater Dunmar, basically the dunarmi basin + Myrani Gap up to the Kharia
#2 Istaros River Valley, extending as far south as Drankor/Desoluation Around Drankor
#3 "Eastern Drankor" basically the area south of the east branch of the Mahar
#4 "South Cymea" basically east branch of Mahar north to the Cymean mountains
Or even actually whether it would make more sense to get rid pf #4 and add it to Western Green Sea
The border is unclear, but I think it is canonical that there is basically some line that divides the plagueland from "remaining human civilization"  on the shores of the western green sea, and south cymea + cymea are good to at least somewhat treat together
rsulfuratus — Today at 1:30 PM
i'm in meetings until at least 2:30, but have a quick break between meeting 1 and meeting 2.  but a few quick thoughts:

(1) i think probably the undeveloped southern regions (south of the Shrev) fit better with 5 than with Greater Dunmar
(2) i'm not sure that 5 and 6 need to exist separately?
(3) Greater Dunmar should probably extend to the Mahar since historically e.g. Kharsan and other regions are central Dunmar; this also tracks basically the regions Dunmar Frontier traveled in. dividing like with 5/6 is "south of Xurkhaz, basically along the border of what is actively mapped. this distinguishes the Nashtkar, which is more rocky, from the high desert plateau of the Garamjala
(4) south cymea does probably make sense to consider as part of Western Green Sea

this however, leaves the plaguelands as basically its own region. maybe that should be merged with greater sembara? unclear to me
re: Cymea yes I think you are right, I had said something like that in the past (worth saving for an actual campaign to develop in detail)
Deciusmus — Today at 1:31 PM
I have a meeting in a few min but I'll dump a proposed restructure here based on the above
Deciusmus — Today at 2:43 PM
my meetting is a bit pointless so I am drawing region lines..... a few questions

Where does vostok go? options

All of Vostok in Greater Sembara
All of Vostok in West Green Sea
North Vostok in Greater Sembara, South Vostok in West Green Sea
North Vostok in "Ursk", South Vostok in West Green Sea
Noth Vostok in Ursk, South Vostok in Greaer Sembara
(my vote is 4, for what it is worth, or maybe 2 or 3)
Question 2:
Irrla - east or west Green Sea ( I vote east, but am pretty undecided)
Question 3:
Cymea - all in west green sea? or is western cymea in Greater Sembara?
rsulfuratus — Today at 2:45 PM
I don't think 4. the svinjo mountains are a pretty sharp dividing line
Deciusmus — Today at 2:47 PM
are they? the in-game vibe I got was that the Vimfrost events and giants and whatnot had a non-trivial impact on this region:
Image
they are obviously a significant barrier in game, but from an "invention" standpoint is that yellow highlighted area more connected to the Vargaldi/white dragons/etc or to the Zimka?
although maybe actually something like this:
Image
S = part of sembara
U = "ursk" region, but actually perhaps a canonically "blank" area
W = part of west green sea
which might align pretty well with 
S = canonically "Zimka-influenced"
U = canonically blank: could be Zimka, could be brand new, might be related to the Vargaldi, etc
W = Skaer/Tollen/mariner
rsulfuratus — Today at 2:55 PM
I think that northern part of Vostok is such a blank slate it is not straightforward to put it in a region. Vimfrost also impacts Sembara, of course
Vimfrost's War is kind of an opening gambit in the Great War
but my sense is that the people on the east of the mountains are not generally putting themselves subservient to giants in order to gain protection from dragons
*west of the mountains
Deciusmus — Today at 2:57 PM
Right that is true;
rsulfuratus — Today at 2:58 PM
I guess ultimately I'd put Vostok and Tollen in Sembara, and have the dividing line for Sembara vs Western Green Sea basically be the straights of Cymea. Vostok is not generally a mariner culture so they look more inward anyway
Western Green Sea then should be Skaer and Cymea
Deciusmus — Today at 2:59 PM
Ok, that works
rsulfuratus — Today at 2:59 PM
I'd put all of Cymea (west, "main", south) in Western Green Sea, even though it introduces some cross-region development w/r/t Tollen
Deciusmus — Today at 2:59 PM
right, which is fine, the goal of regions is really mostly to organize where blank spots are and such not to erect walls
rsulfuratus — Today at 3:00 PM
with this stuff moved to western green sea, i'd move irrla to eastern green sea. i think it works as the western edge of the "east" more than the eastern edge of the "west", if that makes sense
that still leaves the plaguelands isolated as the only thing in a region that is basically the upper istaros. although perhaps orenlas fits in the upper istaros. actually, you could move xurkhaz to the upper istaros as well
Deciusmus — Today at 3:02 PM
so sembara basically this:
Image
rsulfuratus — Today at 3:03 PM
yeah
although i'd put the darkwood in sembara, it is much more closely tied to addermarch than the plaguelands
obviously the line between the upper istaros and the western green sea is pretty vague because nothing is invented in south cymea, but i think find to leave that vague, but include the "undeveloped historical insingue area" in upper istaros and the "undeveloped historical drankorian providence of South Cymea" in western green sea
Deciusmus — Today at 3:46 PM
another question:
Image
where is the line between "Dunmar basin" and "Ruins of Drankor"?
is it more like the red or the black or something lese?
Image
2nd is the dunmari north-western border more like red/blue/black or something lese?
Image
finally should the Chardon vs Nevos/Apporia line be the green one along south chardon area, or more like the yellow one here?
Image
rsulfuratus — Today at 4:27 PM
I think this is roughly what I'd do
Image
Deciusmus — Today at 4:28 PM
where c = chardon?
rsulfuratus — Today at 4:28 PM
yeah
I think the Yeraad river valley is definitively not Nevos culturally, and better to keep the river together. the highlands towards Dunmar (south of the mountains) are Nevos; dividing line between Nevos/Dunmar is arbitrary - Darba was at one point Illorian, after all. the mountains should all be Chardon
the canal is clearly chardonian now, but the area is more nevos in culture. exact dividing line south of chardon TBD since that area is not invented. but for sure the canal should be nevos
to the south, basically the "high desert" should be outside greater dunmar, with the line running Xurkhaz east to Kharja, then south, cutting across the southern edge of the Hara River Gorge (the only outflow from the [[DUnmari Basin]]), then across Yuvanti to the line of the Shrev. this splits historical dunmar a bit but makes a good dividing line in the present between "dunmar-ish" and "true desolation"
Deciusmus — Today at 4:34 PM
Last question is this the right dividing line between "ursk-ish" and far north/eastern green sea?
Image
with the cavaet that the line between "Eastern green sea" and "Far north" is actually totally arbitrary since this whole "far northeast" region is completely blank
rsulfuratus — Today at 4:35 PM
i'd put it along the ket (river that goes west from Zvervinka). that is basically the northern edge of Vargaldi territory and kind of marks "here be dragons beyond"
never decided what, if anything, should be in the blank space just north of zvervinka. probably that is "eastern green sea" (just extend the green line you have now to meet the ket)
and the part of the map that is drawn with boreal forest north of the ket is "far north"
Deciusmus — Today at 4:36 PM
I plan to have a couple of dashed lines to indicate "totally arbitrary"
Deciusmus — Today at 4:55 PM
would it make sense to split Mawar into a region with the rest of the "North Bay" ? it feels like development of the north bay region makes the most sense as part of a renewed interest in mawer
i.e. something like:
Image
M= Mawar
C = Chardon
NS = north sentinenls
S = sentinels
rsulfuratus — Today at 4:59 PM
yes, although actually this is all going to be reshuffled shortly due to the ongoing events in Chardon. there is actually an argumen that the Chardon region should really end at the northern extent of the Drankorian Empire, and that Voltara, Mawar, and the North Bay should be one region. Chardon would be the northern shore of lake valandros, nothwest along the southern edge of tawir forest, then along the mawar boundry mountains
for meta-game reasons, development in the north (voltara and surroundings) have proceded largely without much consideration of the south, except the chalyte trade links them
and lake valandros remains a big blank spot
Deciusmus — Today at 5:00 PM
Image
and then something like this for Mawar + the North?
Image
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:03 PM
yeah. although now I'm reconsidered whether the chardon line shouldn't include north apporia, basically a line from the southern end of the canal through the two hills to the coast
i'm not sure it matters too much either way. there are always going to be boundary regions
Deciusmus — Today at 5:05 PM
the advantage of moving it is it makes the canonical vs non-canonical clearer, i.e. it is a "canon exists north of here" line
but of course as new things are made up those lines will always shift
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:06 PM
yeah that is a good argument
i think i'd shift it
Deciusmus — Today at 5:07 PM
here's what I have
Image
green dotted lines are "this area is so poorly defined the regional boundaries are not clear"
I'll move Chardon/Nevos, any other feedback? otherwise I'm going to number them and update the region map in obsidian
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:14 PM
i'd move the upper istaros / Drankor ruins / western green sea line down to the Istaros tributary that comes from the eastern border mountains.

south of tributary is Drankor ruins, north is upper istaros (west/inland) or western green sea (east/coast). the border mountains south of the river are Drankor ruins, north of the river are western green sea.

reason is simply for ease of description, for the most part, and also because my feeling is that currently the desolation of cha'mutte is a little big and the south cymean world could reasonably expand into the mountains, but probably not too far south of that istaros tributary. but doesn't matter too much as that is obviously an unsettled border
for settled borders i'd push the northern border of the north sentinels up about 4-5 hexes, so it captures all of pandar, which extends for maybe 200 miles north of the mountain line just north of the forest of nightmares, or just make it dotted until the northern border of pandar is settled
otherwise looks great
i can import as a layer to the photoshop file at some point (unless you are doing this in photoshop already)
