Here are a few questions that I think are worth thinking about more broadly that I thought of while reading your Dunmari email...

Can (and do) gods before small miracles (or large miracles?) outside of the mediation of priests?

[My answer: I think this is a really neat trope and something to include in a lot of religions. Little signs the gods are watching / hearing / 'aware' seem appealing as a common feature in Taelgar religions. Examples would be things like small sacrifices vanishing, a idol having a faint aura when the god is listening, a faint sound of approval when a dance was pleasing to a god, whatever. Not sure how much to play these in, and shouldn't be too common or happen all the time, but in the right contexts I think it adds something to the flavor of religious life.]

Are all priests who can perform magic level 1 divine casters, or are there a large (or small) class of priests who can perform magic some of the time, but not really at level 1 caster?

[My answer: I think the world is easier to reason about if large scale casting is rare. But at the same time, having it be fairly common that the local priest can perform a few cantrips, a few times a month, seems like a nice balance and also adds flavor and interest.]

How many divine casters are there in, say, a population of 10 million? 100? 1000? 10,000? More?

[My answer: I'd say in the middle thousands, but less than 10,000. And 80% of those would be level 1 or 2. Less than a hundred would be over level 5.]

To what extent do gods communicate 'the truth' with their followers? Is mystery and controversy and inaccuracy about the gods purpose/desire common? Rare? Does it depend on the 'size' of the god? 

[My answer: I think the gods would show pleasure and displeasure clearly with various signs, and the 'smaller' gods would probably have more unique beliefs, whereas the larger gods (say the Eight Divines) are much more indistinct personalities. But say the kestavo might have very specific desires that they would have mechanisms to express.

to me

Some of these I've thought out in some detail.

Yes, definitely. Large miracles of course get more attention -- e.g., the story from the Festival of Rebirth, where Jeevali basically purified the land from the last of the plague curse so the Dunmari could live there is basically true. But small miracles are, if not common, the sort of thing that most people could be expected to experience at least a few times in their life, and minor signs of the Divine might happen every few years in a community.

I think these are kind of intertwined. Somewhere between 1 and 5 in 1000 people in Taelgar can use magic of some kind, with a highly patchy distribution. My sense is this is high enough that in most places in the world most people would at least know of someone who can use magic, and spells and magic would not seem weird or surprising in most places in the world. But it is low enough that, except for some unusual places with abnormally high concentrations of magic-users, spells still feel unusual and most people can't count on magic to help with their daily lives.

What I think is crucial to keep the world feeling "high fantasy" and not "steampunk with magic" is that the ability of these casters drops rapidly. Honestly I'm not sure it makes any difference for an NPC if they are a level 1 caster or some kind of "level 0" caster who, e.g., only know a cantrip or two, or maybe they can only cast cure wounds once per day, or something like that. There aren't really any world breaking level 1 or even level 2 spells, and I like having healing magic be reasonably accessible because it helps smooth over the some things, like for example having a 1/day or even 1/week cure wounds available in most villages would make childbirth nearly as safe as the current day (although childhood mortality may still be high as curing disease requires a level 2 spell, and if lesser restoration doesn't also function as a vaccination it would hardly do anything about childhood infectious disease). But I'd agree that roughty 80% could do nothing more powerful than 1st level magic, and most of the rest would be limited to 2nd level magic. Third level magic and higher would be exceedingly rare. So like making siege warfare irrelevant with create food and water, fast communication with sending, bringing back the dead with revivify would all be very rare.

I think we are basically on the same page here, and I think this is hopefully how the world feels now in the Dunmar campaign.
 

To what extent do gods communicate 'the truth' with their followers? Is mystery and controversy and inaccuracy about the gods purpose/desire common? Rare? Does it depend on the 'size' of the god? 

[My answer: I think the gods would show pleasure and displeasure clearly with various signs, and the 'smaller' gods would probably have more unique beliefs, whereas the larger gods (say the Eight Divines) are much more indistinct personalities.

This would vary quite a bit depending on the gods, I think. 

There has to be some limits on the ability of the gods to clearly direct their followers to their desired ends, otherwise things get weird fast. My working idea is that the more direct and straightforward the intervention of a god in the world, the more of their power it costs them (and this is especially true for actions that are future-oriented, so telling someone what to do). But they also can't tell in advance how costly a particular action will be, and if they accidentally do something beyond their power, they die/fade (this is kind of lifted from Raven's Tower). So that would make most gods very, very cautious about interfering too directly in the world, except in great need. So, for example, appearing in a vision to a priest and giving them specific instructions for what to do over the next two years to avert some disaster would be very, very difficult and likely destroy the god who tried it. Appearing before the priest and warning them of a coming disaster, with some cryptic message would be less costly, but still very difficult. Sending cryptic dreams would be much easier, and showing up in a vision to reward the priest after they did something the god approved of is easy as well.   

So, for most gods, you'd have a situation where they might be able to communicate general approval or disapproval after the fact, and to perhaps express vague, generic wishes, particularly in the form of values, but would very rarely be able to speak directly and clearly to their followers. 

This ties into the idea that most of what gods do in the world has to be through their followers, otherwise things get rapidly out of hand. So while signs of the divine presence might be common, most actual miracles would be in the form of clerical magic. E.g., if you prayed to a god to heal your child's broken leg, it is very very unlikely that you'd wake up one morning with it fixed. It is more likely that the local priest would have a dream about your child and decide to stop by to visit, and then discover the issue and cast cure wounds. Something like that.
