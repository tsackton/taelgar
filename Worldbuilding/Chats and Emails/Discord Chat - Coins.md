Do you have anything canonical about dwarven coins?

no

only think semi-canonical is dwarven trade bars are stamped and marked to indicate a certain weight of gold or silver in standard sizes and are typically trusted/commonly used for large transactions

right, I've actually used that in my game as well

looking at your Sembara coinage - in practice I feel like this is more trouble than it is worth, unless your players are much more interested in tracking minutiae than my players

i mean it is fine to make up - I actually have some old notes on dwarven, dunmari, and chardonian coins - but i have never found it worth the trouble to actually use these in a game

The only bit I’d use in game is the flavor about debased metals during the 1550s - 1650s, so I might say have a treasure horde with thousands of coins from the reign of Bertram I which are not worth as much as it seems

The other bit I might use in game is words, ie “that drink is a halfbit please”. But we don’t keep track of every coin spent and everything converts to ~10 gp units ultimately for tracking
