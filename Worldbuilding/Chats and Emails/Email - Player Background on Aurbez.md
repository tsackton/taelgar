Chris,

  

Here is a little bit more detail on the region if you are interested.

  

**Climate**

The area is dominated by a large mountain chain to the west and the Plaguelands to the east. It is a marginal land, with hot, dry summers when the ash-wind blows from the east and cold, dry winters when the westerlies blow over the mountains. The main rainfall is in the spring, when in lucky years several soaking rains will replenish the land, and in the summer when the punishing thunderstorms race from the east, bringing flash floods, lightning, and hail. In autumn the rivers shrink, and the temperature is briefly moderate before the cooler winters come.

  

The flora and fauna is reminiscent of central Spain or highland Mexico - some elk and bison in the higher regions, pines and sequoias and similar trees, but definitely not a lush New England forest.

  

**People**

The main inhabitants are the Aurbeze (aur-bez-e), named after the Aurbez plateau which rises just to the west of the Last Inn. These people are mostly refugees from the Istabor River valley (which used to be a great fertile river delta until a magical red mist spread over the land and killed everyone who didn't manage to flee. Now it is a dry dusty wasteland with no people but plenty of scary things).

  

They have built small settler communities and fortified ranch houses (think Mexican hacienda complexes) and have started to try to eke a living out of the land, mostly herding goats, some hunting, and a little bit of small-scale farming and fishing nearer the rivers.

  

They also have a decent amount of trade with Sembara driven by explorers and miners who pick through the dwarven ruins for easily accessible metals and ores and ship them north.

  

The main controversy in this community is about their identity: are they the descendants of Insingue (the largest city in the Istabor valley), destined to reclaim their lost greatness? Or are they smallholders, farmers, and herders, just looking to their children and grandchildren's future, making whatever decisions seem best to ensure a peaceful future? Should they be a great power, or a backwater?

  

**History**

The Great War ended 109 years ago when Cha'Mutte was defeated in a great battle just a few hundred miles to the north and east, in the midst of the central mountains.

  

But his defeat didn't magically cause the hobgoblins, demons, devils, orcs, and others he had gathered in his cause to vanish. The next fifty years were known as the Blood Years and were filled with anguish and loss as the human kingdoms slowly stabilized their borders, won and lost battles, etc.

  

This particular region was barren for a couple of years, and as the dwarves fled south in those early years the region would have been awash in chaos. Black storms of unnatural ash falling on the ground for weeks. Hobgoblin armies passing through, fleeing who knows what. Dark things emerging from the old dwarven mines. But in this time a small trickle of humans started fortifying caves up in the mountains, or building small highly fortified villages. They drifted in from the Istabor valley, for the most part, all with various tales about the terrors they fled or faced escaping and finding their way across a wasteland. Some also came in from the south, where the cataclysm of the end of the war had reshaped the very earth, raising a new set of mountains. 

  

But for maybe a generation of humans, these refugees stayed hidden, as did you -- the land was dangerous. But as time passed, and the human kingdoms established themselves, and the plague winds shrunk to mere normal ash, the region started to grow a bit. The original refugees had children, as humans are wont to do, and the land, if not bountiful, was at least empty.

  

The real change has happened in the last 50 years though. Queen Cece of Sembara (recently dead) ushered in an age of peace and prosperity. She built a road through the region, and more settlers started drifting in: not just people with ancient connections to the Istabor valley, who heard rumors of their culture being preserved here, but also anyone looking for a new start, some free land, etc.

  

This time is when the Inn was founded, the mining and metal trade started, and the political controversies above started.
