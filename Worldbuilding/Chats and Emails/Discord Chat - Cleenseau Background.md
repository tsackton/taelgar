what is the context by which Tristan and your players ended up sitting down in an inn together?


[4/4/2024 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
meant to ask earlier

So Tristan and Vahayia and bunch of other rangers just killed a ghast in Eftly


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
The PCs were also heading toward Eftly to fight the ghast

(Note -
Ghast was giant growing thing much worse than regular ghast)

PCs showed up in Champimont (the biggest town between Rinburg and Cleenseau, but still small) when a big party was going on, basically a celebration/outpouring of relief because the rangers had killed the ghast

The PCs and rangers all ended up in the same inn, and met, and spent some time talking and planning together. About who goes where next to deal with various remaining undead bits


[4/4/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
This scene is after the planning part, when half the rangers have gone to bed and the remaining are staying up talking


[4/4/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
They are in a private back room and the three magically interested PCs and Tristan end up talking


[4/4/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so Tristan has heard the PCs talk about magic and what they can do, but not actually seen them fight?


[4/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Right. He saw Viepuck cast a good berry spell and disguise self but both were odd - Viepucks patron is some kind of Far Realm alien mind and the disguise self is psionic-vibey

(Game mechanically it is written as a projection so it only works on sentient creatures but in world reason for this is not clear)

But otherwise just stories, although the players told their story about fighting undead so heâ€™d know about their types of magic.
