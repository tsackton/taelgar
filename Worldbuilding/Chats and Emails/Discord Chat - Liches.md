I have no idea how the lich was defeated. It doesn’t matter actually since the PCs will not be involved. All I know is that a human woman paladin or fighter (who was involved in the backstory of one of my PCs) is part of it

hmm, yeah, i'll think a bit. even if i introduce in game those details wouldn't matter for several sessions, as presumably you'd need to get back to tollen and ask around. all wellby would remember is there was a lich who was killed


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
The only other thing is that the lich wasn’t actually killed. Just everyone thought he was killed. In reality he ended up trapped by mind flayers in a complex plot


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
But that plot is canonically secret, ie even if my players fail no one in sembara would reallly know about it


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/12/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
But that won’t be remotely relevant to my game until summer 2024 at the very soonest


[11/12/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
And I don’t have well plotted details


[11/12/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
So I have lots of flexibility to let whatever comes up in dunmar game to be canonical as long as it’s possible to somehow have the lich re-emerge later. It could be even not the actual lich, but something related to him. 

The only plot I’m committed to is underdark/mind flayers vibe as the bad guys plus the necessity to run all over sembara region to find info/items/legends/something


[11/12/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
And that I want the lich prologue that’s running now to be connected to the “main plot” so the lich has to be involved somehow


[11/12/2023 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
the idea is that the mind flayers are somehow in control of the lich, or the lich is in control of the mind flayers? or you haven't decided?


[11/12/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
Haven’t decided


[11/12/2023 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
My original idea was that the mind flayers were in control of the lichs phylatcertry and when he was “killed” instead of letting him come back to life they imprisoned him with the idea of using his undeath to fuel a chaylyte golem that would be functionally unstopped and kill everyone


[11/12/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
But I’m not committed to that - all I’m committed to is
A) mind flayers under the Sentinel Ranger 
B) who are doing something bad
C) related to the lich in some fashion
D) where to solve the problem the PCs have to go to a bunch of different places in greater sembara
