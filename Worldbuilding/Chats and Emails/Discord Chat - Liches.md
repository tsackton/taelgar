I have no idea how the lich was defeated. It doesn’t matter actually since the PCs will not be involved. All I know is that a human woman paladin or fighter (who was involved in the backstory of one of my PCs) is part of it


[11/12/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm, yeah, i'll think a bit. even if i introduce in game those details wouldn't matter for several sessions, as presumably you'd need to get back to tollen and ask around. all wellby would remember is there was a lich who was killed


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
The only other thing is that the lich wasn’t actually killed. Just everyone thought he was killed. In reality he ended up trapped by mind flayers in a complex plot


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
But that plot is canonically secret, ie even if my players fail no one in sembara would reallly know about it


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/12/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
But that won’t be remotely relevant to my game until summer 2024 at the very soonest


[11/12/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
And I don’t have well plotted details


[11/12/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
So I have lots of flexibility to let whatever comes up in dunmar game to be canonical as long as it’s possible to somehow have the lich re-emerge later. It could be even not the actual lich, but something related to him. 

The only plot I’m committed to is underdark/mind flayers vibe as the bad guys plus the necessity to run all over sembara region to find info/items/legends/something


[11/12/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
And that I want the lich prologue that’s running now to be connected to the “main plot” so the lich has to be involved somehow


[11/12/2023 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
the idea is that the mind flayers are somehow in control of the lich, or the lich is in control of the mind flayers? or you haven't decided?


[11/12/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
Haven’t decided


[11/12/2023 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
My original idea was that the mind flayers were in control of the lichs phylatcertry and when he was “killed” instead of letting him come back to life they imprisoned him with the idea of using his undeath to fuel a chaylyte golem that would be functionally unstopped and kill everyone


[11/12/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
But I’m not committed to that - all I’m committed to is
A) mind flayers under the Sentinel Ranger 
B) who are doing something bad
C) related to the lich in some fashion
D) where to solve the problem the PCs have to go to a bunch of different places in greater sembara



[2/11/2024 9:27 AM] rsulfuratus
looking at your Sembara/lich email, a few thoughts. 

one thing that is not entirely clear to me is how much of this is supposed to be common knowledge in 1749. don't have to settle it all that soon but i think it shades how I think about some of the events you describe, and also might end up being relevant if the Dunmar group starts asking around about how to kill a lich


[2/11/2024 9:28 AM] rsulfuratus
so for example, "Battle of Something between Tollen and Sembara in 1720" fits in a lot better in the current 1749 vibe if it is widely known to be during the "lich interregnum"


[2/11/2024 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
I am definitely envisioning that the Lich interregnum is widely known


[2/11/2024 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
Some of the deeper plotting (ie relationship@with Umbraeth) probably secret and everyone would think the lich was totally defeated in summer 1720


[2/11/2024 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
Also when it started maybe not super clear.


[2/11/2024 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
But the six months from Jan - June 1720 would be widely known as “lich interregnum” basically from when the dead arose from the ground in winter 1720 until when he was defeated in summer 1720


[2/11/2024 9:33 AM] rsulfuratus
right, okay


[2/11/2024 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
so I think what you describe fits fine with my feelingn about future history, then. the one thing I might say is that it might be slightly nicer to structure this as largely involving the south/west, and less tollen/highlanders, unless it is the only way to drive your players to tollen and you want them to go there


[2/11/2024 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
the reason is that this is the period of tollen expansion when e.g. there are pirate wars and tollen starts establishing dominance over western cymea


[2/11/2024 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
which works best if sembara sees tollen as a safe ally


[2/11/2024 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
but of course a short blip is fine if needed for your campaign


[2/11/2024 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
I don’t really want my players to be interested in Tollen right now. Post lich they might go there to investigate backstory (still working on who the lich is and where he came from)


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
I just wanted a second thrust to the plan for background. My players are invested in the “Enst river valley” pretty heavily so Wisford as a major center is perfect


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
But I don’t want it to feel like “wisford vs the rest of sembara”


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
one option to change the tollen vibe a bit and perhaps play into tollen history is to have the lich intentionally to a terrible job dealing with piracy on the western gulf


[2/11/2024 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
that would be bad for telham and other coastal powers. maybe even telham is blamed for piracy


[2/11/2024 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
sembara has never been a major naval power but if piracy is growing as a problem in the early 1700s they are probably not completely ignoring it. until the lich, and maybe that provides the opening for tollen to be seen as a savior and end up really dominant


[2/11/2024 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
a thought, anyway


[2/11/2024 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
might even be a way to try to get one of the more coastal powers to raise their own army and then declare them a traitor for it as a second front


[2/11/2024 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
The other idea I had was the zimka it is just less made up. But for example the lich could claim the reason the dead are rising has something to do with the baleful influence of the lingering kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
Which sets up a conflict along the north/west border as a second front (and gives me an excuse to inject some kestavo lore into the game)


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, that works too. actually i think the "night queen has withdrawn her favor" seems a little hard to pull off, since it isn't like actual clerics would notice and feels big enough the gods would kind of push back a little? not directly but at least in dreams or whatever


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
so blaming foreign gods seems a lot easier for the lich to make work


[2/11/2024 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
although if you convince the people the elders of the night queen are lying, then it works better


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but it does seem like a riskier plan for the lich than blaming kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
Right I was envisionig the night queen thing leading with the lich executing a group of 8 or so elders of the night queen


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
But it does seem risky. The kestavo is probably a sounder plan


[2/11/2024 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
And more disruptive to sembara as well as it plays to natural tensions in society rather than trying to create new ones


[2/11/2024 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
that is a pretty good campaign hook for the campaign that the adventurers who end up killing the lich are part of: you start the campaign with everyone having a dream from the night queen summoning them on the quest


[2/11/2024 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
but i would probably go with kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
In the kestavo world it’s probably  one of the coastal dukes who’s secretly in league with the lich, and one of the highland dukes (chemin or arnsbury) who ends up revolting perhaps after an attempted/partially successful crackdown on kestavo.


[2/11/2024 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the Duke of Seham is the main Lich plant, and mismanages the pirates (maybe even secretly helping) with the goal of keeping Tollen occupied


[2/11/2024 9:58 AM] .deciusmus
So it isn’t that the lich wants conflict with Tollen, he just wants Tollen to be busy and to feel slighted by Sembara so aid from Tollen is more grudging, etc
