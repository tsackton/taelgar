More random ideas from Dawn of Everything and just in general. Not sure what I think of all of these:

Lizardfolk are fundamentally foragers and hunters, they don't farm, although they do spread wild seeds and such to shape their environments, especially for fish, reptiles, etc which are mainstays of their diets.
Lizardfolk are sedentary by preference, and experts at manipulating the environment, and have a strong tendency to create wetlands and other environments suited to them via horticulture, river shaping, etc. 
Wetlands are extremely productive environments on Earth, although not for cereal grains
Lizardfolk have a strong sense that spiritual enrichment and leisure time spent exploring dreams, prophecy, etc is the true value in life -- acquisition of material possessions is not generally a goal and by creating a super productive environment they rarely need to work a lot to have enough food to live. 
Lizardfolk are anti-hierarchical, and the main roles of chiefs and elders is to entertain and persuade. 
How do halflings eat? I guess through trade. But what about long ago? Maybe there are ancient memories of halflings being roving foraging bands of hunter-gatherers
Humans are in an odd position in Taelgar -- the medieval Christians believed that humans were created with all of the knowledge needed to have cities and such and that anyone not living with agriculture and cities must have been a collapsed civilization. In Taelgar, that is actually true. Perhaps that means that there is nothing like the various indigenous and paleolithic cultures that flourished in the real world.

 few random thoughts - will send more on elves in a bit.

This all makes sense, although I'm not sure why they wouldn't farm at all. Certainly the lizardfolk kingdom in the Kenzo one shot didn't have massive agricultural fields but this doesn't mean they don't cultivate specific crops (e.g. in Isaac's campaign Sasha has invented lilypad cakes as a key staple of at least western/Chardonian lizardfolk culinary culture, made from a flour produced from dried/ground lilypad roots). I agree with the vibe though - lizardfolk villages would be mostly naturalistic with heavily modified landscape but not rolling fields of cultivated crops.

I think of lizardfolk as having a very "this has happened before, this will happen again" kind of vibe. They probably see time as somehow inherently non-linear, with dreams and prophecies representing loops in time, echoes of the past or the future. I think this does lead to the first point very clearly: this is kind of where the lizardfolk gatza ceremonies in Mawar come from, among other things. 

  

I am not sure what 'anti-hierarchicial' means in practice. I think you have elves and halflings with very flat/non-hierarchical political structures, and stoneborn/dwarves with fairly conformist / hierarchical structures. I think lizardfolk could be a bit more magical - like for example perhaps they have a very augury-based system, where councils of elders interpret the signs of the gods to make decisions.

Why couldn't they have traded long ago? Maybe not with humans, but among the lizardfolk, elf, dwarf, and stoneborn kingdoms? Also this is a good place for magic. Perhaps early halfilngs when the world was young had the trick of singing feasts into existence.

I think some of the early conflicts on Hkar could have been between urban and non-urban groups. So for example you have the early northern migrants who have a very non-urban culture. But yes, humanity has only been around for ~2500 years or something like that, so there is definitely not the time depth of neolithic and early bronze age cultures.

I think this is poorly expressed by me and goes to a point Dawn of Everything makes about the difference between "agricultural" societies and "non-agricultural" societies that doesn't quite get captured by whether or not the group plants some specific things. There is a significant difference in human cultures between rolling fields of grain and "manage the environment" which might include planting some crops but doesn't bring with it the whole set of behaviors associated with "agriculture".

  

Lilypad cakes work fine, but I do think that lizardfolk shouldn't "mostly eat bread" in the same way that humans do. And lilypads might not be planted and harvested like cereal grains -- instead perhaps they particularly grow well in large shallow ponds and so lizardfolk shape the river to encourage growth of lilypads, and of course also seed the ponds as needed. But the vibe would be more "taking from our environment" than "farmer". No lizardfolk is spending their days "weeding the lilypad fields" and if the lilypads don't grow well really far in the south, the wetlands produce lots of other foods.

  

Also to add, lily pads might not be domesticated— they could be a wild crop that lizardfolk harvest as opposed to something that if they didn’t plant, they wouldn’t have.

In (some) indigenous human cultures, there was a strong tendency for the chief to not have particular enforcement power. I think that's what I mean in practice.
