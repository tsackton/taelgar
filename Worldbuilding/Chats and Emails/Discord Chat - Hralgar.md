Is there a canonical date when Hralgar was trapped?

only roughly. he was free during the reign of Akaston, and Eudomes both a) trapped him and b) was alive and had to flee during the first plague


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
so that would be roughly 1010-1020 probably?

need to double-check Akaston reign end


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
the notes say Apolloyon

When the Golden Age ended in civil war, and the [[Omnis Pura]] came to power, things became more difficult, and some time later he was trapped by Eudomes, during Apollyon's reign.

is that wrong, should I fix to Akaston


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that's right. i mean Hralgar told you that the emperor he remembered was Akaston, this was the time period he was imaging in the dreamworld in his pre-trapped state


[11/18/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
Apollyon's reign was long so trapped during his reign would make sense
