working on some possible color for theoretical Tollen downtime next session and looking back at Mos Numena calendar brainstorming


[12/19/2023 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
this is a bit thin

[12/19/2023 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
do you remember what any of this means? I think it is your note


[12/19/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
It was really raw brainstorming just trying to organize days


[12/19/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
We had a long thread somewhere about different holiday ideas


[12/19/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I was just reading it, it is back in this history but it kind of peters out


[12/19/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
or, rather, it is not consitent with the holidays we actually used (Viatela and Pyravela)


[12/19/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing I took forward is this idea that there is a paired holiday in early/mid Jan to Viatela which is the “leavingtaking”


[12/19/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/19/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
that is probably no later than first week of Feb, and with three major-ish holidays in a row probably means Feb/March fairly empty


[12/19/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
Also I still think having non-god-based “local” remembrance days is a key part of sembaran Mos Numena


[12/19/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I haven’t sent a canonical date but after Jan 6th, which is the current date in my game. Also envisioned it as minor


[12/19/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
right. still probably think there is likely no universal Mos Numena holiday between the leave-taking holiday and the vernal equinox


[12/19/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, agreed


[12/19/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
I think I was trying to work out if there should be a holiday for each god - kinda leaning towards not


[12/19/2023 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
probably not universal holidays for each god


[12/19/2023 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
I remember having some ideas for a couple of key holidays, one to the Night Queen which is an overnight event of some kind, I think we brainstormed about it earlier in this thread; the other was the idea that there is a legalistic "binding day" of sorts holiday to the father, which might have some legal bearing (i.e. around age of maturity)


[12/19/2023 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, there are a few ideas floating around


[12/19/2023 8:34 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly though just wanted to figure out if there would be a major holiday between say Feb 1st and March 15, which I think probably the answer is no


[12/19/2023 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
might think about a vernal equinox holiday in case you get really distracted and don't leave tollen until after March 21st...but have enough other session prep to do it is a bit easier to not worry to much about big holidays


[12/19/2023 8:35 PM] .deciusmus
I do need to set a canonical date for the leavingtaking holiday; but late Jan would suit well


[12/19/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
a month after leaving taking would be probably too close to pyravela, but maybe 6 weeks


[12/19/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
6 weeks would be Jan 22nd


[12/19/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
7 weeks Jan 29


[12/19/2023 8:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess depends on whether this is true or not:

In the urban parts of Hkar – the culture of Mos Numena, that eventually becomes the culture of Drankor – you have a system that grows up around magical cycles, with the 7 day week being of fundamental importance. A ritual cycle of 50 weeks, with 15 intercalary days (10 following the winter solstice; 3 on and around the summer solstice; 1 at the autumnal equinox, 1 at the vernal equinox), forms the basis of the urban Hkar year. For convenience, the 50 weeks are split into 10 groups of 5 weeks (months). Because a solar year in Taelgar is exactly 365 days, there are no leap years in this calendar, and it never goes out of sync (which also means the dates of the solstices and equinoxes never change).


[12/19/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I think we decided that Dec 11 was just kind of an arbitrary date which had had significance to Drankor or even further back


[12/19/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
I like the above being true, actually


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right at least the intercalary stuff is important as pyravela is the remnants of the old marking of the time between years


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
Vitatela is 10 days before the solstice


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that has a nice symmetry


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
not a perfect week but that is fine


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
well, the solstice is 10 days before the end of the year


[12/19/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
so it has a symmetry


[12/19/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
and with 50 weeks / 10 months / 7 days in a week it seems like holidays hitting the cyclic numbers probably makes some sense from  Hkarian mysticism standpoint


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I was actually thinking about 50 days after Dec 11


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
instead of a number of weeks


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be Jan 30th


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
that works


[12/19/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
For reference medieval England had ~40 - 60 feast days a year


[12/19/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
i think this is one area where less realism actually feels more real in a way


[12/19/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
from a game point of view, anyway


[12/19/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah,  I don't disagree. But I also think there is space for a place like Tollen (or perhaps even more so a place like Embry) to have a dozen local feast days on top of the dozen more universal ones


[12/19/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think from a game point of view the idea would be there is a ritual calendar that is fairly universal and then on top of that you can pretty much just plop a feast day in any time you want


[12/19/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[12/19/2023 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but a lot of the time adventurers are above those local feasts


[12/19/2023 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so they kind of happen in the background


[12/19/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
right, agreed. Or in a place like Tollen, they might even be specific to a ward


[12/19/2023 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/19/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
I do think the Mos Numena ritual calendar should be spaced by 50s and 70s and 10s days and 5 weeks and 7 week type numbers. I also think we established it isn't highly tied to the solstice/solar cycle. Maybe there are explicitly no holidays are in the intercalendary days of Hkar


[12/19/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
7 weeks after Jan 30 is Mar 19 which could be a good day for the next big-ish holiday


[12/19/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
I also think at least one, if not two of the main universal holidays should be tied back to universal miracles, not specific gods


[12/19/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps something about the birth of humanity


[12/19/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps something about Hkar and the downfall (maybe?) or the founding of Drankor in some sense/survival of humanity in those times


[12/19/2023 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
right, i think the idea is that there really isn't much difference between winter solistic and summer solistic in the tropics


[12/19/2023 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so it isn't a big marker of things


[12/19/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/19/2023 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
might just do 10 intercalary days at winter solistice and 5 at summer


[12/19/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
pyravela is part of the intercalary days after the winter solsitce so there can't be no holidays in that period


[12/19/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
there definitely should be a holiday marking reaching the shores safely


[12/19/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
you are going for 15 days to get exactly 50 weeks, right?


[12/19/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/19/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
without getting sucked into another big calendar discussion, what's the advantage of that?


[12/19/2023 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly i just like the symmetry, exactly 50 weeks works out well for allowing a variety of different ritual cycles inside it


[12/19/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
So what about just forgetting about the solar dates at all?


[12/19/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea is that somehow this is tied to various lost magical rituals, which given that extraplanar tides are thing probably also have some connection to the solar year


[12/19/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
after all it isn't entirely clear what the sun even is


[12/19/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
Say that the Hkar calendar was 50 weeks, running Jan 7th - Dec 23rd, which 15 day "winter" outside the calendar, of which Pyravela is the 3 day "middle"


[12/19/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
so you have the year,  then 6 days, then pyravela, then 6 days, then the year repeats


[12/19/2023 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
that actually has a nice symmetry to it


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
although on Hkar the entire 15 days would have ritual significance, only the middle part has been retained


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of think the traveler holidays (leave taking and home coming) might date to drankor, not Hkar


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I was thinking that as wel


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
only problem is that Drankorian year starts on Jan 1 not Jan 7th


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
right but that makes sense


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
the intercalendary dates are not retained


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right of course


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
and it is perfectly logical, I think (or at least, not particularly weird) to -- if pyravela is what is retained -- have that be the end of the year


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that actually works really well


[12/19/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
so it isn't so much that Drankorian calendar starts on Jan 1, it is that it starts the day after Pyravela, which appens to be Jan 1


[12/19/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, the Hkaran people wouldn't have said "our calendar starts on the 7th". It starts on the 1st, obviously 🙂


[12/19/2023 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[12/19/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
It's just that the Drankorians keep pyravela as the end of year, which is why on the "modern" calendar all the ancient holidays are 7 days later than they "should" be


[12/19/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
pasting this into https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anb-F8574X5BJbA4o1oeSRIuNveaXB--u21Owbd9LTA/edit


[12/19/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
and as usual this has become a discussion totally useless for session prep 😛


[12/19/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but I like the end result


[12/19/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
well, to tie it back to session prep, imagine that there are major holidays to 5 of the gods, plus Pyravela


[12/19/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
You get one every 70 days


[12/19/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
(why do 2 of the gods not have holidays? well because the Sibyl's holiday is secret and ... need to think of another god to drop)


[12/19/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
That would work out to 

March 18
May 27
Aug 5
Oct 14
Dec 23


[12/19/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
which actually doesn't quite work, because we definitely don't have a holiday on Dec 23


[12/19/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, and that is kind of too close to pyravela


[12/19/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the vibe of the urban Hkar culture from which mos numena grew is a little more esoteric and also deeply magical. like, I'm not sure you really have too many festivals to the gods, you have the week of fire marking the time when it is auspicious to conduct summonings and spells that connect to the elemental plane of fire


[12/19/2023 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/19/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
i think for the urban hkar culture everything was just "magic"


[12/19/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
the divine weren't necessarily privelged


[12/19/2023 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
but then why does it matter for holidays at all?


[12/19/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure it does. I think the Drankorians take some Hkaran holidays and turn them into opportunities for conversion


[12/19/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so there is that connection


[12/19/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but the holidays they take might only later become assocaited with mos numena in particular


[12/19/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
the Drankorians, as opposed to the urban Hkarans, were definitely much more missionary


[12/19/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, one option is to basically pick 8 - 12 dates and just make up holidays at a somewhat random spacing, and a couple of them might have ancient roots (Pyravela) but who knows


[12/19/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think that is probably better than trying to tie everything to the hkaran calendar


[12/19/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
In which case, I'd say, if you need a holiday for Tollen make it the miracle of surviving the downfall


[12/19/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
in mid-late March


[12/19/2023 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that could work
