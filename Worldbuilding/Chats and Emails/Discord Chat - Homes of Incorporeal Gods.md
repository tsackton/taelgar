working on spiritual realms, now, and i'm actually not sure whether incorporeal gods should, in general, have planes. maybe this is what the original high school conception of the "all the gods are just aspects of the Divine Presence" idea means. Incorporeal Gods are, actually, manifestations of pure Soulstuff and to the extent they have "homes" it is the Plane of Creation itself. 

this might actually simplify some things:
where the souls of people who worship tanshi or kestavo go
the fact that we've never really had any lore about human "heavens" despite there being a lot of lore about non-human heavens
the actual metaphysical distinction between incorporal and embodied gods
the only thing that has ever been made up and canonically exists that is associated with a human god is [[Shakun's Realm]], and that is a distinctly unusual place. it is not a place where human souls go in the afterlife, it is basically a trap for the enemies of Dunmar. so it could easily be an echo realm or a demiplane or whatever, much more like Cha'mutte's shadow realms than an Outer Plane.

Hrm…

part of my thinking is that, if something has not come up in 5 years of running games in Taelgar, and also has not needed to be developed for any of the many extensive discussions of religion, maybe there is a reason
Deciusmus — Today at 8:19 PM
Yeah.
I actually think it does solve a bunch of issues
My only real hesitation is that it feels like it kinda blurs the lines between different religious traditions in a way I’m not totally sold on
But I agree the idea of some kind of Mos Numena heaven seems off

i did at one point long ago develop a Dunmari heaven (this is the Arkaash stub) but i never really liked it so never used it in game
i think the D&D-useful verions of mythological heavens all draw much more heavily from historical religions that conceptualized gods as much more directly interacting with humans, but being much less powerful overall than Taelgar gods
e.g. Greek gods
but also, outer planes in D&D are traditionally associated with alignment, not specific gods
so even in standard D&D models of cosmology is it never exactly clear where the gods actually live
Deciusmus — Today at 8:28 PM
Right. I think the main tension is probably around the "pantheonic" gods like the Dunmari gods and Kaikeka, who both feel like entities that should have some kind of 'real' existence
So where do they exist?
Maybe it does work for them to exist in some sort of nebolous "plane of creation"

I guess I would propose this is maybe something that, in-world, should be completely unknown and perhaps unknowable, and therefore unanswerable out-of-game
people come back from the dead, and can describe their vague memories of the land of the dead, and brave/foolhardy adventurers can plane shift there
but if anyone resurrected after ~10 days doesn't remember anything about what happened after they were on the plane of the dead, and you can't plane shift to the realms of the incorporeal gods, then in some sense they don't really ever need to exist as places that can be described
Deciusmus — Today at 8:31 PM
That's not a bad idea; it actually ties together nicely with the divine spark and the nature of the Divine Presence all being interlated with what incorporeal gods are

i think it also clarifies a bit the basic idea of the outer planes, although it doesn't necessarily answer all the questions about timing.

basically, you have the realms of the embodied gods, created potentially during the riving for the Firstborn who are given physical form and presence by the power of Divine Creation
Deciusmus — Today at 8:34 PM
(and to add, defining what those things are as some sort of unknowa=nable mystery)
rsulfuratus — Today at 8:34 PM
then, you have the "spiritual realms' which are just "anything made of soulstuff"
there doesn't have to be any unified creation story for the rest of the outer planes, and they don't all necessarily need to be "evils of humanity"
i mean we already settled on that basic idea but it was still a little anchored to the "human belief -> outer planes"
