Here’s a slightly different idea/timeline, what do you think...  
  
- originally a very “northern folk” religion, powerful local spirits who you have to be near to here, some develop a more widespread following but ultimately still have to be near. So pilgrimage to important shrines is a thing and some kestavo are widely known but the local one is always more useful (and they are all about intercession with Ahra / Malik)  
- Mariners appear with their pantheon which is not widely adopted and is weak on some level, they are a smallish population and a lot of them have branched off into this direct worship of Ahra and Malik  
- but some of the pantheon starts to be identified with some of the more well known kestavo — this is an unstable situation most likely. Over time you’d expect either the pantheon to replace the kestavo or to fade away  
- as this mixing is going on, Mos Numena spreads north and basically takes over  
  
So you end up without the pantheon really developing, until it actually develops in cultural resistance to Mos Numena.  
  
So there are three trends in the north currently—  
  
The traditional old school kestavo, although perhaps with a belief that a lot of the more powerful spirits are gone, their shrines destroyed. Still intercessionary.  
  
A neo-kestavo religion in cultural opposition to Mos Numena with a belief in a set of major spirits and that the kestavo are their children in some sense. Not really intercessionary anymore.  
  
Mos Numena converts with perhaps some minor cultural differences from the south (Ie a belief that you leave out old bread to appease the vazska)

This still doesn't feel quite right to me. These are just some random thoughts:

  

The original motivation, in some way, for the Kestavo is, a) to give a source for the intercessionary ideas in eastern Mos Numena, and b) to have some kind of lurking older religion with faded gods and interesting quirks, primarily in the highlands of Sembara and Vostok (but also perhaps into Tyrwingha). I think this means that intercession really has to be key. If the Kestavo tradition is already drifting away from intercession and starting to create its own pantheon, it is less of an obvious cultural trend line to intercessionary traditions in eastern Mos Numena. 

  

I was also thinking a bit about the primordial gods, and the threadlines of the development of Hkaran religion. I think when the northerners left Hkar, a lot of religion wouldn't really be organized around gods with names, but rather you have things like the Earth as a divine concept, asking the land to intercede with the creators. And then you have prayers and curses, a prayer of healing in some sense goes via some kind of Celestia angel, and a curse of disease goes via some kind of Abyssal demon. So you almost have more of a kind of warlock-y idea that words have power and less so than specific divine beings, you have people who can 'catch the ear of a curse' or 'spread the goodwill of a prayer', basically warlocks and sorcerers. So when the northerners leave, religion is more about impersonal forces of the Creators than even guardian spirits with names.

  

More generally, I think there is an inherent tension that is tough to resolve between the idea that religion can develop and evolve, and there can be this complex overlay of religious history with things blending and changing, and the idea that the gods are deeply active in the world, regularly grant miracles to their followers, and grow stronger with more worshippers. If you follow this to its logical conclusion, different pantheons should constantly be at war with each other, and religious pluralism should be impossible, because there is a zero sum game of competition between gods. Even if you assume belief is not fixed, the idea that there are faded gods implies that it does matter. Now, it is possible that gods don't actually care about survival -- after all, in some sense they are all just aspects of Ahra and Malik. Or maybe the metaphysics are more complicated, like it isn't just tied to belief, and certainly not just to the number of worshippers. Ultimately, in some sense, the metaphysics don't matter and can be inscrutable, as long as it doesn't seem totally arbitrary. 

  

I like the distinction between intercessionary and pantheonic faiths, and I like the idea that there is a real metaphysical distinction between, say gods that contain enough of Ahra and Malik themselves to grant miracles by their person (pantheonic gods), and gods that can speak to Arha and Malik only but do not have a strong enough or the right kind of divine essence to do more than that. But I think for this to work in practice, the intercessionary religions need to have a very strong sense of what Ahra and Malik are. They are intentionally left vague because in many religions they would be seen as the overgods, the force of creation and destruction, distant and in some sense irrelevant now that creation is done. But in intercessionary religions, these are the real gods. They need context, different names, they need to be the focus in a lot of ways, the things that are really seen as the "gods". I like a lot of what you've created for the Kestavo, but it doesn't feel like an intercessionary religion.

  

I can think of a couple ideas that may be interesting to play around with:

  

One idea would be to actually have the traditional Kestavo religion not actually be a religion at all, in the sense of the worship of gods, Maybe instead, they worship fey. Really pretty much everything you wrote would basically work fine if, as the northerners crossed the mountains, they found a land that was rich in fey spirits, and the small gods they worshipped told them that they were not servants of Ahra and Malik, or whatever the northerners saw them as, but instead the wind and mountain and all these, who are actually archfey. Some good, some less so. Over time Ahra and Malik recent, maybe into overgods, maybe like an earth mother kind of thing, 

  

Alternatively, with a bit of tweaking the wind and the earth could be Ahra and Malik. The small gods carry messages to the wind, basically. Would need to play around a bit but I think there is potential here.
