Born in 1689, Wazir was the fourth child of the wealthy Sayani family in Hamri, and he grew up wanting for little. Born just after the Mindknife Wars, Wazir's generation grew up in the shadow of their parent's losses. Although Wazir's parents suffered little, many of his peers lost one or both parents in the wars, and his childhood was a time of rebuilding and recollections of better days. Wazir grew up with a great appreciation for stories, and was particularly fond of the stories his maternal grandfather told of sailing. His family were important members of the town council and his mother, Aihma, was often away at the Mawar Conclave. He was bookish and curious growing up, and made a habit of wandering the town, asking questions, and generally getting to know the place. Aihma's boy, as he was known, was a frequent sight everywhere from the fisherman's guild hall, to town councils, to the Towers.

As a teenager, however, he started to feel constrained by the boundaries of Hamri and the slow rebuilding. Restless and longing for the days when Mawar ships sailed the coast from Chardon to the Emerald Bay, his mother arranged for him a grand tour, a year long sojourn around the peninsula. Departing from Hamri in the spring of 1708, with his cousin Malaq and letters of introduction from his mother, he eventually found his way to Suhaya, a large town at the mouth of the Sulqat River, where he settled to overwinter. Suhaya suited Wazir, and he became close to a young blacksmith's daughter, now an orphan, trying to keep her father's business going. Wazir found he had an aptitude for tools and crafting, and enjoyed the long days working together at the forge. The winter was unseasonably cold, and for the first time in living memory, the river froze. His cousin, however, had fallen on harder times in Suhaya. A few years older than Wazir, Malaq's parents had both died in the Mindknife Wars, and away from home for the first time, Malaq fell under the spell of gatza, easily accessible in the bustling port town. By spring, Malaq spent too much time lost in the stories of his parents, which always seemed to end in the horror of their unnatural deaths in the war. Despite his contentment, Wazir felt he must bring Malaq away from the ocean, and so took the most obvious course: upriver, along the oddly still frozen Sulqat River. 

That spring and summer was the 1709 second strangest journey in Wazir's life. The river remained frozen, and Malaq and Wazir moved slowly upriver, holding back, waiting for a normal thaw. In May, a large armed expedition passed them, but despite Wazir's desires, they did not join it. By midsummer, the people along the river were starving, and fleeing to the coasts. Rumors of the disappearance of the expedition spread, and the second expedition found Malaq, Wazir, and three others as the only remaining people in Aibard, one of the larger villages far upriver along the Sulqat. When the leader of the expedition asked if any of them were a smith, their armorer having fallen through the ice, Wazir volunteered, and joined the expedition. Deep in the woods near the <EntranceMountains> and the headwaters of the Sulqat, Wazir played a minor part in the great battle that defeated the ensorcelled ice dragon and freed the river from its curse. Key to the victory, however, were three Chardonian heroes. Wazir, only 20, was starstruck, especially by Galena, who seemed to take an interest in him for his own reasons. Encouraged by some minor magic he had been able to do on the journey, and Galena, Wazir parted ways with the Mawar and followed the heroes back to Chardon.

Arriving in Chardon in the fall of 1709, Wazir was struck by the marvel of it all. Larger than any city he had dreamt of, and full of knowledge, and teachers, he quickly grew in skill, both magical and artisanal. Sponsored by Galena to the Great Library, his abilities grew rapidly.  By 31 (1720) he was an honored member of the Praecanti Primis, with handcrafted magical armor and an array of spells. Married to the scion of a Chardonian merchant family, and with two young sons, it seemed like there was nowhere to go but up. 

[Part 2 later. A few notes: 
* No idea really what the big disaster was in the 1680s, but Mindknife War sounds nice and evocative with lots of scope for you to make something up :)
* Would Chardon potentially be the kind of place that would look down on outsiders a little bit? I was thinking maybe the fact that despite his best efforts, Wazir couldn't get anyone to resurrect his sons might be an initial source of disillusionment. And then, once disillusioned, he would start to have his eyes opened to how Chardon has been exploiting the north for chalyte, and isn't maybe so benevolent...]

You know that we are going to have to do a one shot sometime set in 1709 as a group of Chardonian adventurers hunting an ensorcelled dragon....

I like Mindknife War, it is perfect. Could fit with aboleths, but vague enough to go in a different direction if the inspiration takes me elsewhere.

Re: resurrection, I've thought about this a fair bit and I think in Chardon, despite the "high magic" feel, resurrection would still be very rare, given that it is the province of Divine magic, and this is not necessarily something Chardon has in abundance, or at least not in nearly as much abundance as arcane magic. Because of the reality of the gods, it is somewhat hard for temples to be completely co-opted for civilian political purposes, but resurrection requires extremely valuable and rare diamonds, which makes it vulnerable. I do think that there would be a growing move by the imperial powers to control the diamond trade in the 1710s, and to a certain extent this gets caught up in the chalyte trade as well -- the Chardonian political elite begin to exert a lot of their power by controlling the components required for powerful magic. This period, in the shift in outlook from 1680 to 1720, is also when the Magistros (emperor) of Chardon shifts to being effectively a hereditary position, instead of something kind of Doge-like elected by the magical and mercantile aristocracy. So during this period the attitude among the political elite definitely begins to shift towards a much more inward-looking posture, or at least it becomes the case that favors become hard to come by for those not in the inner circle, which tend to be family members of the Magistros. 

In short, yes, it would definitely make sense for Wazir to start to feel like Chardon was closing around him, and he didn't have as much clout as he thought. While it would have always been a stretch for anyone to get two resurrections, except perhaps the Magistros themselves, I could definitely see that as power consolidated among the old Chardonian families this kind of request from someone like Wazir would go from "that is a lot to ask" to "ha ha are you kidding, no way for you." (but of course if Wazir is married to a scion of a Chardonian merchant family, not sure this would apply, unless they were very much new money). Regardless there are a lot of ways not tied to resurrection this could happen. Perhaps promotions come slower, and then not at all, and Wazir's loyalty is questioned. Or access to the newest magical finds gets harder and harder, or something like that.

Ok that’s all good info. 

  

I’m thinking the resurrection not really what I want if not common. 

  

Probably more like, over a few years Wazir had been feeling on the outside. His wife’s family perhaps regretting an alliance with him. More questions about his loyalty. Etc. Then when his first kid dies, a big fight (that Wazir loses) about a Mawar style funeral (whatever that is and however it is different from Chardon). 

  

This connects him to some foreign (northern) religious folks in Chardon, and when 2nd kid dies, he actually steals the body away and has a secret funeral. This is technically a crime, but things aren’t bad enough that his wife’s family turns him in or anything — but it leads to the split with his wife. 

  

 That in turn leads to more questions about his loyalty, etc, and he within a year is discharged dishonorably. And so then he gets mixed up with a radical faction that’s perhaps looking to end the chaylte trade. This faction eventually plans some kind of attack but Wazir is unwilling to join, seeing this as just as bad as Chardon in a way — of course he remembers the stories of when Mawar was a major player in the chaylte trade and feels magic isn’t the problem, it’s the attitude. 

  

So he leaves Chardon days before whatever the attack was, and never really knew if it succeeded or failed. Or if it failed, was he fingered as part of it? Hence the nervousness of his journey — he knows he didn’t really do anything wrong, but maybe Chardon thinks he did. And by then he certainly knows that a dishonorably discharged veteran of the emperors guard, and a foreign to boot, isn’t about to get the benefit of the doubt.

This is great. I like the Mawar vs Chardon funeral thing. Perhaps there are some old northern folk religion practices that the Drankorians tried to suppress and so they became taboo in the Chardonian Mos Numena tradition, but that the Mawar still incorporate. 

  

Going back to our Sembaran funeral conversation, this could be something like in the Chardonian tradition the body in embalmed and there are prescribed prayers for the 10 days until the soul reaches its final home. But the Mawar tradition which draws heavily from Northern folk ancestor worship, the focus is on the passage of the soul to the keeping of the ancestors who will guide it to its final destination. So there is a burial / cremation immediately, with grave goods to draw the ancestors. 

  

Not sure what exactly would be taboo, maybe as simple as burying an “unblessed” body. Could derive from Drankorian suppression, or different cultural assumptions about where undead come from.

I don't know if you had a chance to look at my funerary traditions document, but my idea about the taboo was derived from the Drankorian and now Chardonian idea that the Mos Numena cannot hear you very well if you are not talking to just one god at a time.

  

A plausible result of this would be the idea that a body shouldn't be buried with signs and symbols of the gods, because then the Mos Numena divines can't hear / find the soul very well and it is more likely to get lost in the Land of the Dead. So burying someone (in the Chardonian view) with a holy symbol would be a distraction and a danger to the soul of that person.

  

(It wouldn't be taboo per se in that it doesn't create undead, or cause problems for society. But a religious Chardonian would find it very upsetting to risk their child's immortal soul, for example).

  

The Mawar tradition, on the other hand, emphasizes guidance of the ancestors and semi-divine, and thus burying / embalming the body with these grave tokens is culturally very significant. Because without the grave tokens, the ancestors can't find the soul to bring it through the Land of the Dead.

  

The disagreement Wazir and his wife had would therefore be more of a private one -- it isn't illegal to bury the dead in the Mawar style, but the Chardonians would at least believe it risks the soul of the one buried. 

  

Where Wazir went wrong was in stealing the body of his second son, which really would be a crime (in the same sense the parent without custody is seen as kidnapping their child, and in the same way, the disfavored culture is the one without rights).

  

This all raises an interesting question of who is right? Is it really a problem to embalm a body with grave tokens? 

  

My assumption is, although this area is somewhat fraught with mystery and uncertainty, none of the human cultures 'have it wrong', in the sense that what they are doing is just incorrect. So it must be the case that ultimately, either tradition ends up with good results. One thought I had though is that the outer planes are obviously complex and magical. And perhaps how you enter the divine's realm really does make some difference in what facent/dimension of the realm you experience.

  

So you could imagine the Warlord does in fact oversee a heavenly realm, which really is full of the souls of many of the dead who follow the varied strands of Mos Numena. But depending on how the soul got there -- from the guidance of human priests (Chardon/Drankor), or the guidance of the Night Queen herself (Sembara), or the guidance of an ancestor spirit (Mawar) the place is a little different -- like multiple different realms taking up the same space, somehow. And so you might have the occasional story of a resurrected soul, who really does believe, from their particular experience of the Warlord's realm, that the Mawar rarely find their way to this realm.

  

And a resurrected Mawar could in fact report, with some honesty, that the Chardonians really aren't here. Or at least not many of them.

 saw it but only had a chance to quickly skim it. Will read it more carefully later tonight and add some comments.

  

Two quick things, though.

  

First, I think it is also reasonable for Chardon religious tradition to inherit some of the old Drankorian prejudices -- after all when the Drankorians came north (on the west of the mountains), they were in more of an expansionist phase, they did to a certain extent probably try to drive some of the local northern traditions extinct, and there could be a very "heathen" sense about grave goods. This could persist into the current day, so it isn't illegal, but definitely something that feels far enough away from normal Chardonian traditions that you can't just easily blend them together. Really easy to imagine a fight about whose cultural tradition to follow when a child dies, even if there are no obvious metaphysical stakes. 

  

Second, I think the concern about souls being misled/stolen for unclear purposes could be a real fear, not just the idea that it would be harder for the Mos Numena to hear. There would likely be some debate in Chardonian theological circles about what actually all the various saints and demigods of the Mawar tradition are, in reality, and plenty of people would believe that at least some of them are not real gods in the sense they are not metaphysically connected to the Eight Divines. And lots more would probably believe even if they are real, they lead souls elsewhere, not to the normal realm of the Mos Numena or whatever. So, in some sense, it becomes not a matter of whether your child's soul will be lost, but a question of whose family a child's immortal soul will spend eternity with. Easy to imagine this being a real, difficult conflict for cross-cultural marriages. 

  

Does this actually happen? I'm sort of inclined to say not usually, especially in the sense that people's souls don't really necessarily persist as distinct entities once they reach their final resting place. But what is real here probably doesn't really matter and I would prefer not to commit to anything, since there may come a point in one or more campaigns where PCs travel to other planes (or where one of you actually dies and is resurrected) and I want to keep what the gods' domains are like a bit loose and flexible. Currently not even sure if there is one "Mos Numena" realm or one for each god or what. Or do some share domains? Virtually all resurrected souls are resurrected while still in the Land of the Dead (since otherwise you are talking about 7th level magic which is exceedingly rare), so much more is known about the Land of the Dead than the various other planes (although there would be various myths from Drankor, for sure, which definitely had mages with plane shift and clerics with resurrection).
