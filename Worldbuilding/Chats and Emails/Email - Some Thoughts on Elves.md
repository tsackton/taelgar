Some thoughts on elves inspired by "The Dawn of Everything", as a list of bullet points that may or may not be interesting or true :-)

  

**Elves - Trade and Material Goods**

- Elven society is characterized by material abundance, often via close cooperation with the plants. Nuts, fruits, and saps from semi-magic trees are the staple food sources. Vegetarianism is common at home, although (some) elves have no particular moral qualms with eating animals. Hunting and consumption of animal products was probably much much more common amongst the armies of the Great War, on the march, then it would be in elven homelands in the forests. 
- Elven society is characterized by a division between "insiders" and "outsiders", usually used to mean "elves" vs "other races". Many things seen as obviously true or important amongst elves are treated and managed differently with non-elves.
- Private material accumulation is seen as odd, an affection of the younger races. Elves believe that it is the creation of something, not the owning of it, that is important. So ultimately all trade goods -- a fine set of clothes, a warm cloak, a painting, a golden necklace, etc -- are truly owned by the original creator, and just borrowed for a time by whoever is using it right now. This leads these goods to circulate rather freely in elven society.
- The sale or trade of elven goods outside the elven society is a big deal, as they of course understand how private property works in the larger world. Certainly, if possible, the original creator must be willing to part with the good. 
- The purchase of non-elven goods is also seen as fraught, as despite the lack of understanding by many other races, it is still taking something from them. 
- Trade is therefore somewhat limited, and elven society is often seen as very closed for that reason
- Despite a lack of the sense of private property in physical goods, elves have a very strong sense of intellectual property. A specific artistic style, method of decoration, lyric, poem, etc is seen as the property of the creator, and numerous rules surround this ownership of artistic and ritual creation. This can, in some cases, even extend to for example, specific spells. An elven wizard would likely more happily give away a minor magic item than a spell, even though the spell is just knowledge. Of course, to purchase intellectual property, so to speak, requires your own ideas, knowledge, artistry, etc. Material goods are largely not sufficient or interesting.
- There is no poverty in elvish society. The idea that someone would not have a place to sleep, sufficient food, tools to create, etc is seen as inhumane, in the same way someone in the modern US would, for example, help up someone who fell. 
- The idea that the creator owes the thing created forever applies to land as well, and all elvish forests are seen as Adanor's land. Elves find the idea of buying and selling real estate distasteful, and for example, the ambassador in Tollen would likely have leased (for, perhaps, 999 years) their estate instead of bought it. At some level the elves probably think that all of Tollen really belongs to the lizardfolk gods who created the first swamps here 1000s of years ago -- although they are of course unlikely to say any of that. But they certainly don't speculate in property and within their homelands, homes mostly change hands by consensus. 

**Elves - Social Structure**

- Elven social structure is strongly organized around the _ka_ and the cycle of the generations. In general, elven life is divided up into a two phases:

- The eighty years or so when children are being born and raised (_mela_)
- The eighty years or so when all of the youngest _ka_ is out in the world, or in other elven kingdoms, before they start to return (_leya_)
- So for example the 36th ka was born mostly between 1465 and 1495 DR and reached adulthood between 1515 and 1545. 

- The 36th ka didn’t start bearing children until 1625 - 1655
- So from 1545 until 1625 the youngest generation was in some sense absent
- And in the current day, the children of the 37th ka are all grown (the youngest having left home around 1705), but no one has returned to begin the 38th ka

- WIthin elven society there are three important roles

- The "nurturer", who watches over the young and the homeland
- The "caretaker", who watches over the elder races (essentially in charge of foreign policy)
- The "unifier", who mediates disputes

- These roles are not necessarily single individuals, and in fact how these roles are filled changes between elven lands and over time, and the roles are usually filled differently during the _mela_ from the _leya_. If the generation just born is the current _ka_ (i.e. the kids, call it X _ka_), then:

- During the _mela_, the _ka_ X-1 are the nurturers and X-2 are the caretakers. During the _leya_, however, the roles switch and X-1 are the caretakers and X-2 are the nurturers. Then X comes home, and becomes the _mela._
- So an elf born in _ka_ 35 will have no role for their first 150 years of life, and then be part of the nurturers for 80 years, as they have children, then caretakers for the next 160 years, the nurturers for a final 80 years
- The idea is that a parent will be the nurturer for their child's early years, a caretaker when their children are out in the world, a caretaker again when their grandchildren are being born, and finally a nurturer when their grandchildren are out in the world
- The unifier is always filled by the elder _ka,_ which are defined as those at least 4 generations removed from childbearing (i.e. if the current ka is 36, from the 32rd ka or before)

- Elves have no rulers per se, although humans and other races often see the caretakers are rulers, as they are the "outward" face of elves and often speak with authority - but an elf in general doesn't recognize any particular king or lord has having authority over them, save the gods
- The unifiers are responsible for the Trial of Unity, used when significant decisions are needed, and for the ritual and worship of the gods
- Each _ka_ decides how to fulfill its role and responsibility - although the unifiers are always an even number, always divine magic users, always from the same ka, and always dedicated half to Aldonar and half to Elmerca. Selecting a new unifier is a ritualistic experience (perhaps similar to the Wisdom Trees thing from Chat GPT) that ultimately involves, similar to the Trial by Unity, a community consensus as to who to select. At times, this person gains divine magic as part of the ritual.
- Ka most commonly select small groups to act as the nurturer and caretakers, usually via debate and consensus. By random lottery, trials of merit/wisdom, voting are all possible. Importantly, the older generations have no real say or influence, i.e. there is nothing hereditary about this -- although the previous generation does help the transition -- when a new generation is becoming the nurturer the previous nurturer is 2 generations back and of course can share wisdom, experience, etc.

  

Maybe more later. Let me know what strikes you here and maybe I'll try to write it up a bit more formally.

This makes sense. Indeed I think one of the things that distinguishes the elder races in general is the idea that their societies tend to be associated with material abundance. Lizardfolk and elves coax the land to produce a rich abundance of food; halflings, at least in the Elder days, sung feasts into creation; stoneborn, at least in the Elder days, hardly need sustenance at all; dwarves perhaps have highly "technological" approaches to very high density agricultural (with magical sunlight so plants can grow 24 hours, no need to worry about cold or heat, maybe some semi-magical ways to provide water). 

  

Perhaps this is a defining feature of all the "children of embodied gods" - so orcs perhaps can eat and extract nutrients from nearly anything and so can survive in very marginal habitats.

This seems...complicated. How does this play out? Is Delwath uncomfortable with buying and selling goods in general? This could require a lot of retconning, which of course is not impossible but also worth thinking about carefully. I don't think it is useful from a game perspective to make it the case that any player who wants to be an elf needs to either reject a very common gameplay loop (finding treasure, selling treasure, accumulating wealth and items) or be seen as odd/atypical as an elf. 

  

I do think elves work to seem kind of mysterious and closed - there really is very little to no trade between elven communities and other communities, elven goods rarely circulate in human communities, and elves buy little or nothing from the outside. 

  

But I would frame this as arising from a combination of material abundance (no need to trade for things you can't produce if you can produce everything), a culture of material longevity (elves build things to last for hundreds of years, so there is just relatively little demand for new material goods), and artistic conservativeness (since elves experience time differently it isn't like there is constant churning of style and fashion - although I imagine elven culture is pretty open to a wide range of individual styles). 

  

> - Despite a lack of the sense of private property in physical goods, elves have a very strong sense of intellectual property.

Of course, to purchase intellectual property, so to speak, requires your own ideas, knowledge, artistry, etc. Material goods are largely not sufficient or interesting.

This has the same issue as above. Does this mean that Delwath agonized for hours (off-screen) about whether he could sell the book of Elvish poetry you sold in Darba? Could he have even sold it for gold, instead of a trade? 

  

I like the general sense, but I think it needs some refinement to avoid being kind of annoying to role play in game. 

> - There is no poverty in elvish society. The idea that someone would not have a place to sleep, sufficient food, tools to create, etc is seen as inhumane, in the same way someone in the modern US would, for example, help up someone who fell. 

This definitely makes sense.

> - The idea that the creator owes the thing created forever applies to land as well, and all elvish forests are seen as Adanor's land.

But they certainly don't speculate in property and within their homelands, homes mostly change hands by consensus. 

This might be an easier way to have a kind of unusual take on material ownership. It might even be the case that Melindir doesn't even have a specific legal document granting a lease to his apartments - either an elf just built it once many many years ago (maybe after asking the lizardfolk gods if it was okay), and the city grew around it, or it was something that was gifted by Tollen in some sense, or something else strange like that.

I think the general idea here is interesting, I like the generational focus and the vibe of having no set handed down form from generation to generation. I would emphasize that this isn't a cycle of an individual elf, but rather the idea of how elven society is organized. so an elf who decides not to have children and doesn't return isn't necessarily seen as strange. 

  

I think the thing I'd try to highlight here is that responsibility is handed from generation to generation in a ritualized / formal way, but this doesn't necessarily inform the cycles and patterns of the lives of individual elves, beyond the impact of the ka.

I agree that making elves uncomfortable with buying and selling goods is not very much fun in play. That said, I'm not sure that wealth accumulation being seen as odd for its own sake is a problem. Most elven PCs are already unusual. And the implication isn't that wealth is bad if it is needed for working capital or to aid adventuring goals. But it would be a bit odd for an elf to acquire a fortune. The goal here is to have a structure for making elven society lack significant differences in material wealth. One simple modification that helps it work well in play is to play up the "insider" / "outsider" divide. Perhaps it is not strange at all to buy and sell something from a human or dwarf or stoneborn -- elven creators are privileged. 

  

Or perhaps there is an explicit generational or situational difference. Buying and selling goods **at home** is different than on the road. The location of the market could make a difference. I'm not sold on the specific details above, but the vibe I like is:

  

* Elven society has no significant material accumulations of wealth, i.e. there are not kings or rich folk with tons of gold and money in opposition to middle class/poor folk with limited money

* Elven society none-the-less is not a communist happy-hippie-commune, elves really do see differences in "wealth" between themselves, but it is measured by what you create not what you own

I couldn't quite figure out why elves would be able to produce everything. Where do they get dyes for paints, and gold and silver to work into jewelry, and so on?  I do think that elven society is probably pretty conservative, but there may also be periods, when the generation is turning over, when there is significant demand for "new things" as the new elves establish households and whatnot.

I think this is not about selling a painting or a book or whatever, it is about  _being_ a painter, or a poet, or whatever.  Just like in the real world, intellectual property doesn't mean that you can't sell a book. It means you can't publish a derivative book. The idea here is that elves take this seriously. Perhaps extending it to magic needs a bit of thought so as to not cut off PC elf wizards, but at the same time, it is pretty easy to make it about the elf. There is no reason it would need to be seen as odd if an elf wizard was happy enough to sell their spell-creations. The idea here is that Delwath would certainly not agonize about selling a book, but if he was publishing a book of poetry he'd be hesitant to make it too similar to someone's existing style.

Agree with this. It is _generational_ not specific to an individual, as you say. I also think that the idea of "out in the world" is perhaps overstated here, I suspect some elves don't even leave their homeland, but focus on learning skills, or something. The idea is that they are grown up but not fully part of society, and expected to fend for themselves. That could be just down the road, so to speak, or it could be out in the world, or it could be on another plane. Perhaps the "just down the road" is in fact the most likely. It should be easy for an individual elf to not participate here, either via simply not returning (although I think there is something a bit fraught about that, in the sense that the idea of elven society and the generations does imply that if you simply don't go home for the 20-30 years at the beginning of your generation's _mela_  you won't ever have kids). But realistically, in game, that seems unlikely to matter, partly because the 1740s are an in-between time (the mela for the 38th ka would start in ~1780 I think and partly because most campaigns don't last 20 years.

I see what you are going for and I like it - but maybe the solution is simpler. Maybe there is just no real value in accumulating wealth in elven society. People might collect art because they like it, or books, but the idea of accumulating wealth for the sake of wealth is just....weird. This could easily arise simply from the idea of material abundance - like, there are no billionaires in Star Trek because what does that even mean? Elves on the outside would sometimes accumulate wealth, because it allows them to accomplish useful things. 

  

I elaborate on this below, but imagine if the elves - at home, anyway - can basically grow whatever they want. Harvest gold from trees, spin silver from moonlight, etc. Accumulating gold is kind of pointless, then. If you want it, you just plant a gold tree (in reality it would be more complicated and magical than that, but that's the vibe). What is limiting is creative / artistic / intellectual / whatever production. 

  

So then you get a society where there is no real concept of wealth because there isn't anything you can buy with money - at home, elves probably don't use money for anything (although perhaps they do mint coins for various purposes, or at least used to). 

  

However, you still get the "wealth" in the sense of poetry, art, painting, smithing, gardening/growing, etc, as you discuss.

Where do they get dyes for paints, and gold and silver to work into jewelry, and so on?  I do think that elven society is probably pretty conservative, but there may also be periods, when the generation is turning over, when there is significant demand for "new things" as the new elves establish households and whatnot.

  

Magic is the obvious answer. Elves were the first, they walked the world before any humanoid. In the beginning, there wouldn't be anyone to trade with anyway - it was just elves. So maybe the early elves figured out how to grow metal with magic, and carefully crystalize gemstones from flowers over years, and transmute leaves and vines to dyes, and grow insects that spin not just silk, but cotton and linen and all manner of fabric. 

  

You walk into an elven city, and it isn't oriented around trade and commerce the way human cities are. There are strange trees, and a vaguely feywild feel, and gardens of gemstones just beginning to bud from stalks and bright silk butterflies emerging from cocoons that are spun from silk that is harvested for clothes. 

  

And maybe these things aren't easy to do, so it isn't like elves are secret billionaires, or like dragons with giant hoards of wealth. But they are possible to do, so there is no motivation to trade, really. Maybe in the past, there was more trade, say before the Great War perhaps there was some casual commerce between the elves and Chardon, or the dwarves - not because the elves needed anything but because it was interesting, and new. But now with many of the elves who remain in hiding, it has mostly gone away.

It means you can't publish a derivative book. The idea here is that elves take this seriously. Perhaps extending it to magic needs a bit of thought so as to not cut off PC elf wizards, but at the same time, it is pretty easy to make it about the elf. There is no reason it would need to be seen as odd if an elf wizard was happy enough to sell their spell-creations. The idea here is that Delwath would certainly not agonize about selling a book, but if he was publishing a book of poetry he'd be hesitant to make it too similar to someone's existing style. 

I think this idea is worth developing a little bit, but I guess I don't yet have a good sense of the vibe. I like the idea that there is "richer and poorer" in elven society based not on material wealth but on what you create, what new things you bring into the world. But I'm not sure how this fits with strong intellectual property protections, which seem more about enabling capitalism and guaranteeing return on investment. If it is about the value of the artist, couldn't you go the other way and say that elven artists want to be copied, since that proves their worth? If no one imitates you, you don't make a mark on the world, that kind of thing.

> Agree with this. It is _generational_ not specific to an individual, as you say. I also think that the idea of "out in the world" is perhaps overstated here, I suspect some elves don't even leave their homeland, but focus on learning skills, or something. The idea is that they are grown up but not fully part of society, and expected to fend for themselves. That could be just down the road, so to speak, or it could be out in the world, or it could be on another plane. Perhaps the "just down the road" is in fact the most likely. It should be easy for an individual elf to not participate here, either via simply not returning (although I think there is something a bit fraught about that, in the sense that the idea of elven society and the generations does imply that if you simply don't go home for the 20-30 years at the beginning of your generation's _mela_  you won't ever have kids). But realistically, in game, that seems unlikely to matter, partly because the 1740s are an in-between time (the mela for the 38th ka would start in ~1780 I think and partly because most campaigns don't last 20 years.

Right, this makes sense.
