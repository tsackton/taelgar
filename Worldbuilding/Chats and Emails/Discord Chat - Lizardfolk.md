have you given much thought to lizardfolk family structure?

Also did you ever decide Vahiaya level/character class? They might show up leading a group of rangers soon in my game


[2/12/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
And I might need stats. I can just make something up if you didn't have ideas

had some conversations with Eric about lizardfolk family structure - he played a lizardfolk in the Kenzo solo who was taking care of two babies. but we didn't decide much that was cannon, except a vague sense that a) they probably don't give live birth; b) the young at a very early age are probably mostly aquatic, but unclear when this stage ends, and unclear if this is like a tadpole stage or actual baby lizardfolk. 

from Eric's Mawar character have the sense that at least some lizardfolk have fairly traditional nuclear families at some point

re: Vahiaya - did not give much thought to a class, but figured probably mostly a martial - either straight fighter or a ranger. does not feel like a paladin to me

I kinda like having family structures and biology being (potentially, somewhat) more complex than "standard nuclear family like 1950s humans" for species - one of my players had a few ideas he was mucking around with (generically, not specifically for Taelgar) which struck me as potentially somewhat interesting for lizardfolk


[2/12/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking ranger


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems reasonable. only level constraint would be that in 1749 they are significantly weaker than you, so like 7-9th level at that point, if not lower


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
I was going with 3rd-5th


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
Haven't figured out hich is best


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
seems good


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
But they retire soon after the undead stuff


[2/12/2024 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
5th level in 1749 fine too, doesn't really matter to me


[2/12/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
don't necessarily disagree - my only pushback would be I don't want other species to end up in a situation where you need to read 5 pages of lore to play them "properly"


[2/12/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. Anyway not really something I was thinking about much, just offhand. Mostly trying to organize all the undead stuff and plan out a few things for my next session.
