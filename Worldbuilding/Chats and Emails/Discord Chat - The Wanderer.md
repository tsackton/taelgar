on separate topic - do you have any notes on how the traveler is depicted?

this is what the note says but not sure it is up to date: "The Wanderer is usually depicted as a young man, dressed as a traveler or a merchant, in a cloak, with a walking staff or a scale."

One sec. Z is having a friend over for a sleepover and he just arrived

Despite having a player who is a paladin of the Wanderer the specific visual aesthic hasn't come up much. I think the above is basically about right, although I suspect some depictions might focus on the charitible side of him

I'm not 100% sure what would be though; in my game the focus has very much been on the "charity/outcasts"
