Here is a tweaked Sembara map based on your reworking of the western frontier.

  

Note these are the borders I'm thinking about in 1748. I think in mid 1600s, southern marches 3 would not exist, and southern marches 1 would not extend as far south. I'm imagining as trade with Dunmar resumes and the memory of the wars recent, people will start moving to the frontiers to take advantage of profits that can be had from mining, trade, forestry, etc. But in the mid 1600s the memory of the Western War would be very recent and the land still quite dangerous south of the southern highlands. 

  

For the western marches themselves, I like your suggestions, although I wonder if WM4 even needs to exist at all in the mid 1600s. By 1748 this could be a frontier area, but this is perhaps the most marginal land, largely forested, and in the 1600s might be the domain of outlaws, freeholders, small, rough groups without formal allegiance to anyone, and the real functional border of Sembara would be the line of forts running north to the border of Ardlas from the end of the wall. Over the course of the early 1700s this area becomes safer and small communities of foresters and hunters expand, and Sembara invests in a line of defense along the upper reaches of the Wistel, which is probably easily defensible given the terrain, and all of WM4 would be hard for an army to move through anyway. Thinking out loud, really.

  

Let me know if the map is roughly in line with what you were thinking, easy to tweak borders a bit more.

I generally like it...

I was  thinking Ainwick 50-75 miles to the east, almost back in the heartlands. I was picturing a significant difference between Ainwick -- not really under military threat, but the seat of the Baron -- and Dunmore -- the real garrison town, and I think that works better with a little more distance.  Also if you are tweaking the map, can you add Wistford somewhere kinda due south of Embry on the Wistel?

I can see in the 1650s the whole region west of the Ainwick forts (the North Watch) between the Wistel and the unnamed northern branch that runs through Ardlas as a bit of a wild, unsettled frontier. By the 1750s, perhaps Ardlas has expanded south, and the North Watch is defunct and a new line of forts has been established on the Wistel instead, and the area is a more like the Marches of Enford was in 1650.

For the southern marches at least in 1650, I was envisioning really only a single meaningful kingdom, with the land south of the "gap" quite sparsely populated. But still trying to think it through. I was thinking that maybe the main city included a small population of refugee elves, who ended up settling there as they fled north from the plague lands...

Okay, so how about this. 

  

In 1650, you have Ainwick, Marches of Enford and Dunfry. Ainwick is super-militarized, and Dunfry and Enford are recovering from occupation. Beyond the North Watch, you have some folks from Sembara and maybe Ardlas trying to make a living as best they can (totally to you for needs of your campaign exactly how this is organized, whether "officially" part of Sembara or not. In the south, there is a border kingdom, SM2, also recovering from occupation, with the land south of the highlands/gap a bit of a wild waste, but some folks are cautiously venturing out, mostly along the mountains, where timber is plentiful and mining is good. I could see a small elvish refugee population, although I don't really imagine Taelgar elves actually living in human cities except when they have little other choice (in contrast to dwarves, halflings, and lizardfolk which do sometimes, and stoneborn who may for a specific purpose). But maybe it is a very small group. By 1748 the main elvish population in this area is to the east, in the forests just south of Tyrwingha / lizardfolk territory, where the reclusive, hidden kingdom of Orenlas survived the war and has slowly rebuilt over the past few hundred years, just now beginning to expand its reach into the human world of the Green Sea. 

  

By 1750, the southern marcher kingdoms have spread south, with the scattered community of refugees and tentative frontiersfolk organizing themselves into a government. I imagine SM1 forming first, and then as trade develops SM3 basically being a few ambitious lords who figure that with some knights and a bit of luck they can earn good coin protecting trade or something like that. 

  

Anyway, sending a revised map shortly.
