(Jan 2021)

Here is what I have on Sembara. A lot of this isn't necessarily set in stone - the only campaign I've run there is the Plaguelands family campaign which is by far the least played and least developed campaign. Some bits of this touch on Dunmar campaign via Wellby's background, but not much. My notes here are kind of disorganized.

  

**Basic History**

The super-rough overview of big picture history of Sembara / the Green Sea area is as follows. Sometime in the 3rd age [Elven reckoning, the Age of Hkar], humans and other non-elder races began settling Taelgar. The first humans in the area, which I've been vaguely referring to as the 'East Northlanders', spread across the areas close to the sea, some in the highlands as vassals of dwarves, etc. These people are unrelated to Drankorians and have different religion, language, culture. I've been thinking of them as rather fey-connected, and the original builders of various runes and stone circles around Sembara (such as the one that Maglor and party encountered in the one game you played in the family campaign). Perhaps they worshipped archfey lords as gods or something, I haven't fleshed this out beyond a pre-Drankorian human culture with fey connections.

  

After the fall of Hkar, in the 4th Age, Drankor was founded and expanded north, driving out or assimilating the various 'east northlander' cultures, and bringing the Eightfold Way religion and new, more powerful arcane magic. The area that is now Cymea and the Plaguelands were basically depopulated, whereas in Sembara the Drankorians assimilated the culture a bit. The northword expanse of the Drankorian empire was stopped at what is now the northern border of Sembara (in name at least, see below). So Vostok and especially the Skaer Islands (Skaegenland) retained a stronger connection to 'east northlander' cultures and are more 'east northlander' in language and culture. However, Vostok was heavily influenced by trading and probably was converted to the Eightfold Way religiously (thinking kind of like the end of Roman advance into Germany, where German tribes on the other side of the border still Romanized to some extent). Further east along the north side of the green sea I haven't sorted out really.

  

After the fall of Drankor, Sembara probably split into a bunch of warring small kingdoms, etc, with various degrees of 'east northlander' and 'Drankorian' identity with some with the emerging 'Sembaran' identity. This is pretty up in the air. Then, maybe 3 generations before the Great War, Sembara unifies/conquers the lands of Sembara and most of Vostok, in a unified monarchy / empire. After the fall of Cha'mutte, Vostok is lost almost immediately, and I imagine that some of the northern border regions and near the mountains may be Sembaran in culture only, effectively existing as small kingdoms/etc (haven't really fleshed this out, plenty of room to be creative, and the lich king takeover could also be in part responsible for some subsequent fragmentation of royal control). However, Derrik's dynasty retained the rich agricultural center of the country, and maintained control over the lowlands of Tyrwingha. The border marches, along the plaguelands and the former Urlich monastery pass, are also probably significantly independent, although probably formally under control of the king. I originally imagined this as something like the Welsh/English border, with tons of fortifications and a fair bit of independence granted to lords willing to take on the challenge of border defense. 

  

**Politics/Culture**

As far as politics, really nothing is fleshed out beyond some broad strokes basics. Sembara is a roughly feudal constitutional monarchy, and probably has been for a while, perhaps since constitutional reforms introduced in Derrik's father's time, just before the Great War, but likely the relative power of the king and the lords has waxed and waned over time, and could be in a high point or a low point during your campaign. As an aside: I have been playing with the idea that Sembara is relatively low magic in the scheme of things; in Chardon for example, I've taken some ideas from Eberron and common magic items are actually common, at least among the well-off; this is to some extent carrying on Drankorian culture, which was high magic indeed. The fey-influenced 'east northlanders' however had a very different attitude, and Drankorian style magic was seen as potentially evil, and certainly unnatural. I can see some of this attitude lingering in the idea that at least ostentatious displays of magic are seen as suspicious or wrong or foreign, although not to the extent that magic is forbidden or anything. 

  

In the area marked Sembara on the map, I also am working to add a few smaller political entities, basically things that were once part of the Sembaran empire, but loosely, in the sense that e.g. parts of Spain were part of England at one point. The 'ancestral' kingdom of Sembara is really the rich agricultural lands marked H1 in the politics map, extending to the western and southern borders, excepting the lowland area near Cymea (Kingdom of Tyrwingha; now currently part of Sembara but could be recently reunited by marriage and may have been an independent kingdom during your campaign). The areas to the north, up to the border with Vostok, and especially the mountain highlands, are flexible. I was thinking, for example, of adding a few human kingdoms or civs that are effectively vassal states of Dwarven kingdoms.

  

As far as other political entities go (but these don't have to be the same ~100 years ago):

Vostok is very loosely sketched out. Probably a place to put various small warlords, city states, perhaps loose tribes/confederations, other random stuff. Vostok describes a cultural region more than a true kingdom or anything like that. North of Vostok, there is an ancient great wall. I haven't decided whether this was originally built by the 'east northlanders', perhaps with Fey help to guard against some long forgotten evil in the north, or Drankor (but that would be weird as Drankor supposedly never conquered Vostok), Sembara when it was an empire ruling over Vostok, or after the Great War, perhaps as defense against hobgoblin armies from the north. In any case there is a huge wall here, cutting off Vostok from the plains to the north. Canonically, north of Vostok is the main Kenku refuge/homeland in the world now, but it does not have a name.

The Free City of Tollen is an independent city state, that is one of the centers of magic in the east, and probably maintains its independence in part though magic. When it came to be is an open question. This is supposed to be a university town, perhaps an Athenian democracy, a free-wheeling place, etc. But not really fleshed out much except that Evendur studied there. 

Cymea is supposed to be a collection of city states mostly, kind of like the sword coast in FR but with medieval Italy crossed with Byzantium crossed with Spain feel. The only thing I've set in stone here is that Cymea is the only place on the green that sees itself as a descendant state of Drankor, and has adopted 'Drankorian' attitudes, to e.g. magic. 

Skaeganland / the Skaer Islands are the homeland of a group of seafaring people descended from the 'east northlanders' who were never conquered by Drankor. Very independent, fled to islands to escape, probably worship different gods than the Eightfold Way. The 'east northlander' ancestral language survives mostly in Skaegish, which is written with the same alphabet and at least the plaguelands campaign I've let people who speak Skaegish read old east northlander inscriptions. 

Further east is pretty much up in the air, although I have some loose ideas which I can share if it would be relevant to your campaign. The halflings that ply the green sea are the main traders, bringing goods out of the east to markets in Cymea and Sembara.

  

I haven't really committed much in terms of an economy, other than at least some regions of Sembara are major agricultural producers. 

  

As far as non-humans in the area, other than the aforementioned Kenku. There are several lizardfolk settlements, including a large independent area between Cymea and Sembara, and another one in Sembara that is governed as an independent enclave (in general, lizardfolk tend to live where they live and are left to their own government and laws by humans around them). Lots of dwarven kingdoms in and under the central mountains (this is where Seeker is from). Some Stoneborn, mostly in the northern part of the central mountains; they are relatively rare and tend to live in small isolated communities. Halflings are a major presence, some in human cities, others running trade routes both on land and sea. Very few elves in the area, although canonically there is an elven city in the forest west of the lake just south of Cymea (this is where Meriele is from). But there could be other elven cities too - although they tend to be very rare and not live among humans much, if at all. 

  

I probably have a few more notes scattered around but that is everything I can find at the moment. There are a few other things in my head that may or may not end up relevant that I haven't bothered to type up.

==========

'm working on a google doc I will share shortly. A few random thoughts:

  

* What's the scale on the map? I'm envisioning Sembara as about the size of France, maybe a little bigger.  

* Here is my thoughts on 7 regions of 

** H1/C1/RT1 -- basically the land between the three rivers (starting from the first interior river, i.e. not the border with Volstok, ending the southern river the lizardfolk live on. This would be the heart of the ancient Sembara kingdom and would have been a Drankorian province long ago.

** S1 -- still a key part of the Sembaran kingdom - merged with H1/C1/RT1 at least 100 years pre Great War, maybe even longer. But was a separate Drankorian province, more of a border province. Has a separate identity (think Northumbria vs southern England). 

** LK1 (Tyrwingha) -- traditionally independent, but joined to the crown in the last generation. More of a personal union under the same crown then anything else (i.e. King of Sembara and Trywingha would be the king's title)

** the border marches (WM1 - 9). Depopulated and overrun during the great war, but in some cases recovered in the last generation, but also, still the plaguelands to the south and so on. Not the safest places in the world

** HK1/HK2 (merged into one region). A highland barony/duchy/whatever. Conquered just before the great war, Would have a pretty separate identity and would have been separate for some periods since the Great War (but in my campaign would have been recently conqueored). Could have close ties with the dwarves and probably somewhat less Drankorian in culture (i.e. scottish vs english)

** HK3: An independent highland kingdom, probably very closely aligned with one of the dwarven kingdoms. Was thinking of extending the space by this kingdom to take the entire region south of kenku lands/the months. Likely only loosely a kingdom at all - many clans/fiefs loosely aligned under a high king or something (thinking early England for example, but on a smaller scale). Could be a couple of kingdoms, aligned with different dwarvish tribes, whatever.

** RT2. This is a southern highland, right? But it would have been one of the first areas of Sembara conqueored by Drankor. I was thinking this might have been the most disruption from various wars, especially the collapse of Drankor. One idea I had was that originally (when Drankor fell) it was part of Tyrwingha, and held onto a largely Drankorian attitude. But it was decimated by being a border between the growing Sembara kingdom and Tyrwingha, and more so by hobgoblin wars and maybe some other historical disasters. In the period just after the Great War a huge migration of people occurred, with the majority of the homesteads and villages abandoned, as people fled east to Tyrwingha or north to Sembara.This would have left it a rich land to resettle, and starting about a generation after the Great War, it would have maybe been a bit like the American West -- a new place, nominally under the control of Sembara but mostly newly populated, maybe with some conflict between small settlements that stuck it out and the newcomers. 

  

I have been working on a regnal line / family tree as well, I'll send along.


==============

For scale - there is a scale bar in the bottom corner of the world map, which is canonically fixed based on travel times in the Dunmar campaign and other campaigns. Sembara is very roughly 950 miles north/south and 680 miles east/west, but in practice not all of that is part of the kingdom of Sembara. France is about 540 miles N/S and 400 miles E/S. So Sembara is significantly bigger than France, more like the size of the Carolingian empire; during the Great War when much of Vostok was included it would have been even larger, approaching something like Napoleon's empire in size, or perhaps more like the Hapsburg empire if it were all mushed together.

  

I already have a big empire on the west side of the map in Chardon, and I think that after the Great War Sembara would not really have the resources to hold together a huge united kingdom, so I'm aiming to break things up a bit. The total area of the 'known world' is somewhat bigger than Europe, so feel like even in the mapped region need more diversity of governments/civs, don't want everything to just be big empires -- even given large uninhabited stretches. 

  

I will send a regional map of Sembara with some borders and towns soon, depending on how much work I have to get done today.

More comments. I can't find the my notes for what the provincial abbreviations mean, but roughly it was: WM = Wild Marches; HK = highland kingdom (meaning pseudo-indepedent); LK = lowland kingdom; H= heartland; C = capitol (think Ile de France, possibly I was thinking this region would be dominated by personal lands of the king, but not at all committed to that). Not sure what RT and S were supposed to mean.  

  

> ** H1/C1/RT1 -- basically the land between the three rivers (starting from the first interior river, i.e. not the border with Volstok, ending the southern river the lizardfolk live on. This would be the heart of the ancient Sembara kingdom and would have been a Drankorian province long ago.

  

Yeah, this makes a ton of sense and what I had in mind. Also probably the ancient heartland of the 'east northlander' civ and the most productive agricultural areas. However I may split some of RT1 into Tyrwingha to make Tyrwingha a bit big and 'core Sembara' a bit smaller.

 > ** S1 -- still a key part of the Sembaran kingdom - merged with H1/C1/RT1 at least 100 years pre Great War, maybe even longer. But was a separate Drankorian province, more of a border province. Has a separate identity (think Northumbria vs southern England). 

This makes sense. Probably also influenced by the more cosmopolitan city of Tollen next door, which is a major knowledge generator. A bit like modern Scotland seeming a bit more international than modern (non-London) southern England. May also be more urbanized than core Sembara (especially by 1748, perhaps less so in 1657), as land is less good for farming.

 > ** LK1 (Tyrwingha) -- traditionally independent, but joined to the crown in the last generation. More of a personal union under the same crown then anything else (i.e. King of Sembara and Trywingha would be the king's title)

Yup this is exactly how I have things. In my notes somewhere is that the formal crown is exactly what you put. I think I will expand Tyrwingha a bit in the new version I'm working on.

 > ** the border marches (WM1 - 9). Depopulated and overrun during the great war, but in some cases recovered in the last generation, but also, still the plaguelands to the south and so on. Not the safest places in the world

I've been calling these the Wild Marches, modeled on English/Welsh border as I mentioned. They are better established and safer in 1748 than in 1657 obviously. 

 > ** HK1/HK2 (merged into one region). A highland barony/duchy/whatever. Conquered just before the great war, Would have a pretty separate identity and would have been separate for some periods since the Great War (but in my campaign would have been recently conqueored).

Still ends up with Sembara being a bit big if these are part of the Sembaran kingdom. I'd like ultimately (in 1748) Sembara + Tyrwingha to be about France sized or a bit bigger, with the rest split off in various ways. 

 > ** HK3: An independent highland kingdom, probably very closely aligned with one of the dwarven kingdoms.

Could be a couple of kingdoms, aligned with different dwarvish tribes, whatever.

Yeah this works well. Definitely planning on splitting this off from 'core Sembara' in 1748.

 > ** RT2. This is a southern highland, right? But it would have been one of the first areas of Sembara conqueored by Drankor. I was thinking this might have been the most disruption from various wars, especially the collapse of Drankor.

This area I have the most trouble with. Canonically (in Plaguelands campaign), this is fairly low density and not good agricultural land, although the river valley in WM3 is a rich apple-growing region that is known for apple brandy. So I think I may divide this a bit, basically shave off the western part, which along with WM4-6 may be sort of a Beornlings type independent kingdom, which extends a bit into the Plaguelands.

  

WM3 is Addermarch, where the Plaguelands campaign takes place. In 1748, it is well settled, an agricultural exporter, with a relatively rich marcher lord, Earl Eofric; WM2 and WM4 are basically vassal states of Addermarch. The Sembaran king is distant and not a major part of everyday life here; Eofric is functionally the king in all but name.
