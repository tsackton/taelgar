thinking a bit about biology/fertility/lifespan of other species as part of a bit of cleanup of the species directory.


[10/30/2023 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
general idea is: elder races (need new name) are all long-lived but generally not super high fertility, each for somewhat unique reasons. humans, goblinoids, are basically typical Earth human. fey have their own strange relationship with time. other species are basically assumed to be human-like unless there is an obvious lore reason to change them.


[10/30/2023 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
elves: non-overlapping generations, ka, as we've discussed extensively


[10/30/2023 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
stoneborn: kind of think they should actually be born from stone, and gradually turn back to stone.


[10/30/2023 2:20 PM] rsulfuratus
lizardfolk: generally think of lizardfolk as having a very extended old age. mature at same rate as humans, fertility ends at same rate as humans, but they remain active and healthy into their 200s relatively frequently, so just have a really long elder period. makes their culture a very elder-focused. most kids would know not only their grandparents, but their great- and great-great-grandparents, at least


[10/30/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
dwarves: generally think of dwarves as just having really low fertility, kind of a very extended middle age and a relatively short old age. come of age only a little slower than humans (late 20s/early 30s, when they do the heart of the mountain ceremony), but remain capable of bearing children until 150-200, and then often live another 50 years after that


[10/30/2023 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
halflings are most human-like, basically Tolkein-esque, just often living a bit longer than humans


[10/30/2023 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda think lizardfolk need something a little more interesting


[10/30/2023 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah they are the least appealing but not sure what


[10/30/2023 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
I agree on dwarves, halflings, stoneborn


[10/30/2023 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
general idea is elves and stoneborn are the most alien, dwarves and halflings are the most human


[10/30/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
Dwarves probably need something more interesting too, but it is probably private and secret and not *that* different from humans


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the point about dwarves from a worldbuilding perspective is just that they would kind of feel like stretched out humans - you'd have a lot of dwarven familes with 2-3 kids, they would just often be a decade apart


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
they already have the coming of age ceremony, the thuhr, all that, I don't think they need too much weird biology on top of that


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
That's kinda what I meant by not that different.


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
right, makes sense


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn't thinking weird biology so much as somewhat non-human marriage and family-rearing customs


[10/30/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like in-game dwarves outside of their homeland are almost always unpaired


[10/30/2023 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense, also can be left to a player who really cares to develop


[10/30/2023 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is true. hadn't noticed that, actually.


[10/30/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
I do have a minor NPC in my game who is a nonbinary dwarve married to a woman. But he is explicitly very undwarven


[10/30/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
*they


[10/30/2023 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
the dwarves in Tokra being a notable exception


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess there was a whole family there


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, it doesn't matter much. I just expect there is something a little more interesting going on in the dwarven marriage and pair-bonding culture than "copied from humans"


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, sure


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
But it wouldn't be a world-building thing


[10/30/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Lizardfolk on the other hand.... a few ideas...

hatch from eggs? Maybe culturally there are large rare clutches from just one woman? so lots of siblings, no sense of nuclear families, pairbonding unrelated to child-rearing

a spawn stage after birth, like where they are more fish like and independent?

rapid maturity?


[10/30/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure I like any of those, just brainstorming


[10/30/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
Could be lots of clutches of eggs, with lots of lizard folk "young" not surviving (but I don't really love that, would imply lots of predators eating the young or something)


[10/30/2023 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Communal tending of eggs? Temarie like-learning through the shell? Maybe lizardfolk spend a long time in eggs (several years) and the elders tend to the eggs and lizardfolk hatch knowing how to talk and such


[10/30/2023 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe very conscious control over fertility, so the community plans how many kids to have each year (how many eggs to lay?) and it is all very elder directed and egg laying is not really connected to pair bonding or "family" per se


[10/30/2023 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I think “hatch from eggs” and “primarily aquatic during first few years” are in my notes somewhere


[10/30/2023 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
Could also make them like some fish, maybe they reproduce parthenogenically and have the capability to metamorphose to change sex if desired


[10/30/2023 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
probably want to run some ideas by Eric before making anything canon


[10/30/2023 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
His Mawar lizardfolk character at least had some sense of a “family back home”


[10/30/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Not sure if anyone else has ever played a lizardfolk in a real game


[10/30/2023 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Also in the Kenzo one shot Eric played a lizardfolk who had found a baby lizardfolk abandoned and decided to care for it (it turned out to be something else but the idea of a non-aquatic baby needing care has to at least make sense)


[10/30/2023 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Even if the “find one abandoned” is quite unusual


[10/30/2023 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
another idea. what if the thing about lizardfolk is that they are actually reincarnated. so in order to have a kid you need to convince an ancestor's soul to come back. would give them complete control over fertility since if you don't want a kid you just don't ask.


[10/30/2023 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
from a worldbuilding perspective I think the key idea is that creating a long-lived race that is much less numerous than humans requires some fiddling with fertility and growth rates.


[10/30/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
I like that last one


[10/30/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Although "family back home" doesn't necessarily mean "traditional nuclear family"


[10/30/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
Probably the key thing here, which doesn't need a full answer now, is that lizardfolk have specific conscious control over fertility. So population growth is very managed and they tend to maintain stable populations around the carrying capacity limit of their choosen environments


[10/30/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Which actually makes a ton of worldbuilding sense -- there are no lizardfolk striking out to find new land, for the most part. There could be lizardfolk cultures / communities that are actively expanding, and others than are not, but it would all be very self-conscious and community directed (so not even "each lizardfolk couple" chooses whether to have a kid) but more "each communitiy allocates kids in some fashion"


[10/30/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that works well



[10/31/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I've used them a bunch as kind of 'not-quite-enemies' in Isaac's campaign, but you all never bit on the investigating kobold raiders in the myrenai gap side quest in the Dunmar campaign


[10/31/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
Which isn't to say they shouldn't exist or anything but I've been cautious about having too much going on at once


[10/31/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
in my game, I mean


[10/31/2023 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
in my typology the only creations of the Void Mind / Three Despairs are orcs and goblinoids, plus undead (Ghesyn, the Soul Eater) and lycanthropes (Jinnik)


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so anything else wouldn't be a strictly evil race IMO


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
right, makes sense


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
I think if there were background lying around in Obsidian on kobolds I might use them somewhere, I just don't have any thoughts on them, per se


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
kobolds in my mind were created by dragons in the early days of the world and basically got left behind when the elder wyrms diminished in power during the Long Pause


[10/31/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case if you haven't used them for anything I can add some notes based on how I've introduced them in Isaac's game and my general thoughts


[10/31/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
will probably be pretty thin to start



[7/26/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm slightly editing the species doc. my intention is not to suggest there are lots of additional species that are associated with dragons/fey/elementals/giants, but rather that giants, dragons (+kobolds), fey (many different species), and elementals (many different species) are their own thing separate from the more general "awakened/cursed/other" category


[7/26/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
are they necessarily though?


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
in practice I don't think it matters


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe not really


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm questioning whether, i.e. Titans should necessarily be considered canonical


[7/26/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
or whether it means anything to say "Dragons were [something] by great wyrms"


[7/26/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
I think that is maybe under considered and if we ever decided to make up the history of dragons and what they are precisely, the existence or not of great wryrms in the age of myth isn't super relevant


[7/26/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
same deal with giants; whether titans are a real thing or not I'm not sure it is meaning to say that giants are in some sense an "echo" of titans.


[7/26/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
This is more relevant to me in terms of the fey where I'm not at all convinced that the story is "archfey created fey" but maybe something more like "some type of essence that has been conceptualized as fey by the current fey existed before time and its transformation during the Riving created many different fey creatures, of widely varying power levels"


[7/26/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i am fairly attached to the idea that giants and dragons are somehow larger than life and have this history of being vastly more powerful, with echoes of that power (e.g., phasing stones, flying castles) lingering


[7/26/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the fey and elementals are distinct and in some ways more complicated and so perhaps not too helpful to lump all four groups together


[7/26/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Again, not sure it matters in the species doc; I'm really just arguing that sentient species - including fey/giants/elementals - should have some kind of unique creation story and/or a canonically blank space filled only with vibes


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'd rather say:

Giants and dragons are, in some sense, echoes or descendants or creations of the beings of pure magical energy that existed before the Riving


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
and than describe your vibe thing above


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/26/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think it solves some problems to just say the time before the Riving was in some sense unknowable and is vibes based only and be judicious about which existing structures on Taelgar echo back to a pre-Riving time.

Clearly giants, dragons, fey, and elementals do (although for different reasons) but I'm not sure it would be a problem if a fifth category came along that should also echo back to ancient days. But that doesn't necessarily imply the existing of some specific set of entities created by the Divine Presence


[7/26/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking about what is actually in game and not world building, I think:
- the vibe I described about giants and dragons is important, and also for giants some kind of history/echo of much stronger magic in the past that is connected to rune magic and the dwarven firstborn and such (leading to myths -- maybe true, maybe not -- that the Runecrafter learned magic from ~someone/something~ during the Riving)
- the fey are diverse and despite having different forms and power have a shared history, so it doesn't necessarily make sense to have a separate "origin story" for satyrs vs pixies, for example. the fey, writ large, have a kind of collective origin of some kind, dating to the riving
- elementals are similar, albeit someone more hierarchical and ordered, and much more commonly soullles magical creations (most standard "water elementals" or whatever are this) than fey are, and they are orgainzed around rulers of each domain (e.g., marid, djinni, efreeti, dao), who in tern owe allegiance to some kind of "elemental powers" of which gazankoa is the only named example


[7/26/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes that dynamic (unknowable, vibes based) probably makes sense


[7/26/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
for pre-riving "history"


[7/26/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I agree about all of that, but I actually think it is more important to, i.e. state that the fey, as a "type of creature" have a shared origin that dates to the Riving than to try to say that "archfey" existing before the riving and fey are somehow related.

and I also think that "echoes of the Riving" is a potentially more flexible category than just fey/elementals/dragons/giants but also doesn't necessarily include say kobolds and trolls even though kobolds are dragon-ish and trolls are giant-ish


[7/26/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I think I might modify the inner plane native to separate out "echoes of the riving" (fey, elementals, dragons, giants at the moment), from "other" and then merge "corrupted, awakened, unusual" into "other" which is just everything else


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense to me


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
although actually corrupted I thought was a decent category on its own


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, right, good to keep that as well


[7/26/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
Mentally, it feels to me like the areas I'd be comfortable just randomly introducing something in game without some kind of pre-dicsussion (YMMV might be reasonably different than mine) would be 
(a) corrupted
(b) types of fey or elementals
(c) beasts
(d) magical creations
(e) children of creation
(f) abberations

But things that didn't fit in those categories I'd probably want a better story and compelling reason


[7/26/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Which is were in particular, I find the species guide useful. To define the types of things that are "common" vs "rare", in some sense


[7/26/2024 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is reasonable. i pushed an update that I think is clearer. will slightly tweak age of myth text, and then merge, later tonight

[7/26/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
also might add explicit comments about "easy to add things" and "think about it" and "probably don't" to the now 10 categories

but having dinner now


[7/26/2024 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus

[9/4/2024 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure if you are interested in this, but with the new D&D rules now available I've been thinking a bit about updating the set of playable species in Taelgar, both to bring homebrew species up to the new design and to have a bit more principled set of playable species (motivated by the new family campaign I'm starting and Isaac's friends wanting to make new Taelgar characters for the semi-defunct Great Library campaign). 

thinking a little bit about it, my feelings are that there are really potentially four groups of species.

1. standard species are species that are widespread, deeply integrated into worldbuilding, and straightforwardly available as PC options (but they don't have to be common, e.g. elves). I'd consider these to be: human, elf, dwarf, lizardfolk, halfling, stoneborn, kenku, centaur at the moment but could move other species here possibly.

2. fey species are the large class of feywild natives that often find themselves on the material plane and would usually be viable PC options. These would include: satyr, "fae/fey" (which needs a little thought as to the generic "fey humanoid" species stat block), fairy (pixie/sprite), changelings, some kind of "beastfolk" options (e.g. haregon, owlin, tabaxi type species, but requires a bit of thought)

3. "unusual" species are species with well-established lore and integrated into worldbuilding but that have complications that prevent them from being a straightforward PC option. orc, hobgoblin, goblin, bugbear, kobold, merfolk, gnome are the most obvious ones here. maybe shifter to represent lycanthropes.

4. "rare" species are things that might be viable player options but are not integrated into worldbuilding. mostly things like the various "plane-touched" humans (aasimar, tiefling, genasi), or the dhampir/hexblood/reborn Ravenloft lineages, or the "underdark" species variants. maybe warforged


[9/4/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
my main interests at the moment are:
(1) solidify the set of standard species and homebrew new versions of them
(2) solidify the set of fey species but typically use published versions for them
(3) make some decisions about what rare/unusual species would not disrupt the Taelgar vibe to include


[9/4/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., Nathaniel originally wanted to play an orc, which I decided was too complicated for the game I want to run, but in principle I could see an orc PC as being kind of an interesting option in the right campaign


[9/4/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
but, again, not sure if you care too much


[9/4/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not massively interested in thinking about additional homebrew rules as my game probably has 2-3 years still to go and I have no plans to run anything small scale in Taelgar (i.e. if my game for Zachary's friends restarts, it would not be in Taelgar)


[9/4/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
My main interest would be impact on worldbuilding


[9/4/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
to the extent that there is any...


[9/4/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
My instinct in games I run is to wait to homebrew stuff until people want it, but I can see how that doesn't work as well for your kids/their friends


[9/4/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah it is particularly a challenge for Isaac's friends because they tend to be a lot more build-oriented than anyone else I run games for


[9/4/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
so they always want to see the traits/features before they decide what to do


[9/4/2024 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
In general, I think there is a benefit to "less is more" in this space though. D&D has way too many playable species


[9/4/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
even if they just rebuild their existing characters I need dwarf, lizardfolk, (some kind of fey) for them, plus halfling, elf, human for my family game, so that is nearly all the most common options anyway (except for stoneborn which no one ever seems to want to play)


[9/4/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i feel like there is a fair bit of tension between worldbuilding and what a lot of the people I run games for want here, so i'm trying to balance


[9/4/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
from a worldbuilding perspective adding more species gets to be quite annoying, so the humans + elder folk is a great setup


[9/4/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
and having diverse fey options seems like a good compromise to expand the playable species quite a bit with minimal worldbuilding impact


[9/4/2024 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
Yes, that makes a lot of sense to me


[9/4/2024 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
In particular, having a wide variety of fey species doesn't actually commit any of them to be "real species" with lore and stuff. There's no need for a defined community of taxabi to have a half-cat fey


[9/4/2024 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
right, exactly. it is the obvious solution to any kind of "beastfolk" build


[9/4/2024 10:35 AM] rsulfuratus
the big things I'm not sure about that could impact worldbuliding are:
(1) kobolds have always occupied a bit of weird place. i've used them a fair bit (mostly in the Great Library) campaign and they don't really work as a "typical evil" race (orcs, goblinoids). generally they've been regarded as a nuisance and sometimes a threat by humans nearby, but there is certainly room to expand kobold lore. adding kobolds to centaurs and kenku as "playable weird species not from the feywild" would give 9 species + fey options that feels pretty complete. 
(2) there are a large number of D&D species that are basically plane-touched humans. i don't want these to have big communities and have lots of lore, but i'm not sure whether or not it would matter to allow e.g.  one-off aasimars with unique backstories that are fundamentally "human".


[9/4/2024 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a place for kobolds as an interesting "other" species (to go along with kenku, merfolk, and centaurs in particular) and a "nuisance" but not "creation of the void mind" species seems like it could fill a niche


[9/4/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
As to (2), I think sensible having some one-off stuff (which, actually, kinda fits in the lore via a "magical soul", especially for tielflings or aasimar


[9/4/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
(and probably Gensasi as well)


[9/4/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
if it were me I don't think I'd let anything outside of assimar/gensai/tieflings in though


[9/4/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
for "plane touched" humans


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
Potential updated elf. Goal is to streamline a little bit (no need to repeat spell descriptions in the traits) and balance against PHB 2024 Elf. Could potentially use a couple more ritual choices, and the 5th level improvements for Elven Ritual Magic are maybe not strong/interesting enough.
