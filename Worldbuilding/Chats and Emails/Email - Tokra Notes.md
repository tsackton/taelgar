(Aug 2021)

Basic idea:

Ancient town, originally a center of Dunmari learning and knowledge associated with the Lakan mysteries, as well as an important religious/government site.

Has been at least partially ruined and rebuilt several times, most recently after the fire giant attack.

Refugee camp [this will be mostly gone by the time you get there, presumably]

Stretched across the plains on the banks of the slow, muddy river, refugee camps. Many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people and livestock and horses, the noise of animals and low conversation and the bustle of lots of people living life is constant.

Many Dunmari from Karawa here as well. Ikram has set up a small bar area, a big open fire circle with some rough seating areas and tents for shade. Quickly becoming center of camp.

Bridge

Crossing the river is an ancient bridge. Shaped out of one solid piece of smooth gray rock, no seems or anything, except for a huge crack through the middle that has clearly been patched. Decorative pillars on both sides of the river are gone, knocked off long ago; a more recent addition of two rearing horses with flowing manes stand at the far side of the water.

City

Tokra is a walled city, surrounded by a solid thick walls, with only the small docks and some farmland outside. The walls are patched and obviously have been built and rebuilt at different times. The gate is a massive piece of dwarven construction, shaped from six huge pieces of steel, each 4' high, making the entire gate 12' high and 10' wide. Each panel is embossed with a different scene from Dunmari history: a woman leading a host of people crossing a river; Jeevali, stretching out across a great, dry plain, weeping tears that flow off her face into rivers; a young woman on a horse, racing as fast as the wind, riding into battle against orcs; a small contingent of Dunmari cavalry riding against an overwhelming army, a black draconic face looming above them; a giant striding with a host of behind him, Laka standing on a cliff facing him down, Stoneborn, dwaves and Dunmari at his side; the city rising from the rubble, rebuilt.

Inside the walls, Tokra is dominated by three large buildings that flank a central plaza: a large pentagonal temple, an even larger palace/hall, and what seems to be a library or archives. The architecture is definitely Dwarven-tinged, with a lot of heavy stone blocks and square, imposing facades. All except the temple, which is clearly distinct, and much older, with a large domed roof (similar to e.g. Pantheon in Rome).

By the main (east) gate, and also the river gate, are markets; outside the west gate are massive stables and a caravanserai for travelers; smaller inns also stand inside the walls, largely on the edges of the markets.

The town is packed and bustling, although little commerce is happening. Instead, the concern is about food, and disease, and safety.

Lakan Mysteries

About 2 miles south of town, perched on a cliff above the river sits the Lakan Mystery temple.  Outer wall; courtyard with dormitories and kitchens; inner wall; inner space with monastery itself, shrine/temple, and private spaces. Big library here.
