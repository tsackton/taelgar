so, I wrote this kind of on a whim when I wanted to do something different for one of my intros (around the Empty Moon / werewolf arc) and I haven't quite figured out what it means yet

what is key is the idea of extraplanar tides


[12/7/2023 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
this is also now canonically part of elven lore, albeit on a different time scale


[12/7/2023 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, my sorceror gets a different bonus spell in the new vs full moon


[12/7/2023 10:05 PM] rsulfuratus
what i am not sure is if the moon is responsible for extraplanar tides on taelgar, does it really make sense for it to actually exist on other planes?


[12/7/2023 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
on the theory that during the full moon its divine/outer planes, during new moon it is fey/inner planes


[12/7/2023 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
right that makes sense and is consistent with lore


[12/7/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
right, you are wondering about this line: " rising bright rising moon. "


[12/7/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
I forgot i wrote that


[12/7/2023 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/7/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
stars probably work better actually


[12/7/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't want Twilight's Grace to feel gloomy


[12/7/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
so that moon line was just throwaway


[12/7/2023 10:08 PM] .deciusmus
happy to change that


[12/7/2023 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus
it is kind of an important decision that seems like it is hard to go back on so want a bit of time to puzzle it out


[12/7/2023 10:09 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, sure


[12/7/2023 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
agree twilight's grace shouldn't feel gloomy


[12/7/2023 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
but also light could work differently in the feywild. no need for a visible source of moonlight to have moonlight


[12/7/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[12/7/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
I could also imagine a faint glow on the horizon and a spray of stars, like the milky way above


[12/7/2023 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway i deleted namecheck but will leave status/tim to remind me to think about it a bit.


[12/7/2023 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of like the faint glow on the horizon and a spray of stars imagery


[12/7/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
I rewrote it like:


The realm of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. A land of perpetual twilight, but full of sparkling lights, music, and games.

Note: Could potentially have a moonlight connection, but unclear if there is a moon in the Feywild. For now avoid reference/mention of moon until this is determined.
