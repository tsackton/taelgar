You have some things going for you - it is winter, so planting isn't until March/April, and therefore a decently large portion of the peasantry is freer-than-normal. They aren't entirely idle (you have to tend livestock, cut wood, make charcoal, repair tools and plows, etc) but it is definitely the "slow" part of the agricultural calendar (summer, between planting and harvest is the other slow time).

The total population of the region is:

**Cleenseau Manor**
Cleenseau itself - 1150
Taviose - 30
Aulout - 100
= ~1300


Elsewhere:
Asieneau  - 300
Valit - 250
Beury - 500
= 950

Ganboa (Lizardfolk) - 50
  
So you are looking at a total population of about 2300, of which you have 50 lizardfolk, a handful of dwarves, 50-60 halflings, the rest humans. Basically everyone lives in one of those 7 named villages though, there are no scattered farms or smaller settlements. Only Cleenseau is walled, although Asineau has a stout stone manor house, and Beury is rapidly building a wooden palisade. In addition to that, there is a metalsmith and weapons-making community here - one of the profit centers of Cleenseau is taking reclaimed metal from the abandoned dwarven mines in the south (i.e. around Ausson's Crossing, from the mini-series we did), forging it into weapons, and then selling them west to the army. 

At the moment, the region is on a sort of "semi-war" footing. Ida is organizing the army through the traditional lines, paying for things, etc. In this model it is hard to support more than say 10% of the population as part of a "full time" military force (town watch/guards, or soldiers), although the core of Ida's existing army (50 people) wouldn't count for that. So on "semi-war" footing you are basically looking at ~280 people across guards and soldiers and with some capacity to equip them, with some trade-offs between better equipment and number of folks being equipped. Churning out cheap spears and shields is probably easy. Crossbows and swords take longer, although the garrison has equipment to equip about 80 soldiers.

If you want to get really geeky about this, you can assume a community of about 10 trained weaponsmiths (a couple of whom are master-level) plus another 25 apprentices and simple blacksmiths who could be redirected, and tell me what you would want them to do. Or I can come up with some hand waving, or one of you who is geek-ier about medieval weaponry than me can come up with some hand waving. Most of these folks will be working on projects already (and winter is probably a popular time to work on weapons and such because it is easier to hire cheap extra labor) but could be diverted with money or persuasion. Materials would likely not be an issue, there are decent stocks of metal and wood in town - labor time is the bigger cost. Some of these folks would be working on weapons for the army already, but plenty would be working on private projects or other types of orders that they'd have to cancel or delay. 

Other notes on equipment: hunting is not really a big thing here - the woods are broadly too dangerous to be a good source of deer and the like, and not a lot of people go south of the Enst. There are some part-time caravan guards around, but most of the place is pretty basic peasantry, and a hayfork or woodcutting ax is the main metal sharp things people would own. Some slings for hunting squirrels and such, and the garrison has, as mentioned about, full military equipment for about 80 soldiers but otherwise equipment, more than people, is likely going to be your biggest constraint.

A full war footing would involve appropriating materials and labor, and would allow you to field a significantly larger force (up to say 35% of the population, more if in desperation you start accepting the older, the younger teens, etc). It would also let you utilize the full resources of the smiths without worrying about funding. A full war footing sustained past the end of March (it is mid January now) though would have a very significant impact on the planting though.

Basically, at the moment the population is scared, and worried, but no one is _quite_ thinking of this as an invasion. Some public preaching could certainly make it easier to transition to a full war footing - but that has its own challenges as well (i.e. making everyone feel like a full scale undead invasion is imminent could result in some people fleeing, etc).
