(Jan 2021)

I'm starting to play around with elves a bit, and one thing I want to work out is where exactly they settled.

  

It seems to me of the elder races, you have a few strands:

  

Elves and dwarves and stoneborn seem to mostly have their own settlements and their own polities. 

  

For dwarves, there are clearly a set of individual kingdoms with their own political history, although for the purposes of Sembaran history the dwarves of the <CentralMountains> are the main important group. But are they trading across Sembara with dwarves in the east? Are there dwarves in the east but there just isn't much (non-magical) traffic? 

  

For stoneborn, it seems to me that they select for very isolated and remote places, the tops of mountains and hidden valleys and so on. I don't have a good sense of their political organization. Maybe they've never formed meaningful large units, and each small village is self-governing, and they are scattered around the world in isolated communities.

  

For elves, I have a vision of a race in downfall. But in the past, there were great empires, and they were the defenders of the land. I think they should have built magical forts on the edges of 'civilization' to defend against the orcs and the mind flayers, and some of these forts are now super weird ruins. And in some cases, the foresight given by Elmerca caused them to build forts where some frontier will be in a thousand years. Stuff like that. So I envision an active set of defined empires and lands in the early days, which were brutually attacked (ala the Morgoth assault on the tolkien similarian elf kingdoms) but massive orc hordes during the downfall. Why Hkar sunk is probably best left to legend, but the elves lost 2/3rds of their population, and I see that as because they were on the front lines of whatever happened. So after the downfall, the elves retreat, to (a) some fragments of their ancient empires and (b) some new hidden places where they can stay away from the world and rebuild.

  

Then there are lizardfolk and halflings, who at least so far seem more intertwined with humanity:

  

For lizardfolk, it seems like we have mostly been putting small lizardfolk societies on the edges of human civilization, although that doesn't mean there isn't a vast swamp somewhere (say like the Panatal) where they have a huge presence.  

  

For halflings, they clearly have no obvious fixed homeland and just travel the world.

  

Thoughts?

==============

  
  

Stoneborn and lizardfolk, which are kind of the "middle children" of the elder races, are created next, and are never super common, especially as they favor unusual/rare environments.

  

Dwarves and halflings are the "younger" elder races, and the most like humans in some ways. Dwarves, of course, do build big empires in and under mountains, and many of these kingdoms have survived a long time. They are not very creative or flexible with their social organization, so pretty much all dwarven kingdoms are just that, kingdoms, usually with only the way the monarch is selected being what varies (whether hereditary, rotating among clans, by some kind of council, by magic, by the gods).

Yes, there are definitely overland dwarven traders -- this is kind of baked into the 'traveler" caste. The idea is that while most dwarves stay put, a small subset are heading everywhere. While the center of dwarven innovation, mining, culture has always been the central mountains, which are the biggest and most significant mountain chain on Taelgar, other mountainous regions also have dwarven settlements and kingdoms with their own histories, and dwarven merchant caravans crossing the land are certainly not a totally rare sight.

Stoneborn live in small isolated communities in small isolated places, and always have, never spreading into large kingdoms or empires or really even any political organization bigger than a village. At the moment I don't really have any stoneborn players so I've left them kind of at the fringes of the world without developing too much. The "ogres" from high school who they developed out of were isolated races of zen monks, basically, who were expert fighters. Trying to keep a bit of the same vibe without being derivative/stereotypical. Obviously room for this to change based on need of campaigns, but the general idea of small isolated villages in extreme environments has always been the case, so there is no sense of 'downfall of the race' or anything.

Yeah, this is good. The elves are created first, and to them the world was given. They spread widely, with a few major population centers: the broad band of subtropical forests stretching across Dunmar into the southeastern hills/mountains; the northern forests stretching basically the entire interior of the west coast; the more fragmentary but still large forests of Cymea/southern Sembara/Irebor. Possibly they also settle in the vast northern taiga in the far northeast, and in the the southern jungles -- depends on whether it would be interesting to have some truly tropical elves and some truly arctic elves. But there are also small elven kingdoms in other scattered places, basically anywhere with forest. Elves in the Elder days would have very much seen themselves as protectors of the world and everyone in it.

Lizardfolk are in many ways similar in attitude to stoneborn, I think. They tend to stick to their own communities, although in many places in Taelgar their communities are not so isolated as they tend to live near water and humans do the same thing. So they integrate more with humans, but still 'on their own' in meaningful ways. Like stoneborn, they have never been empire builders and rarely have political organizations more extensive than 'village', although I'm not committed to this and if it ever is needed in a campaign could change things. They are also left a bit vague -- Sasha is my only lizardfolk player and while he gets into the lore he isn't really a worldbuilder yet. But historically, they were not necessarily more populous -- there were bigger swamps, perhaps, but with lower density settlement. 

  

In general I think that lizardfolk and stoneborn feel like they have a similar trajectory -- never major players in the Elder days even, in the sense of rulers of vast empires. Important in local regions, obviously, and meaningfully important due to magic, etc, but if you had to characterize the elder days, it would be the age of elves, or perhaps the age of elves, dwarves, and halflings.

  

My only slight hesitation with this is that it feels very Tolkien-esque. But I think that might be fine -- Tolkien is a great model for mythic history, after all, and also elves as a society feel quite distinct from Tolkien elves, with the generation thing and all that. Elves, dwarves, and halflings are way more central to pretty much all fantasy stories than all the other weird D&D races, and I think it makes sense to have them be more central to the mythic history of Taelgar as well. 

  

But, I'm open to changing things up. I do think it is important that the elves are the only one who have the 'downfall of the race' feeling. Of stoneborn and lizardfolk, I think lizardfolk have much greater potential to have been major players in the Elder days. 

  

One option would be that there were vast lizardfolk kingdoms in the elder days, and they also, like elves, had a bit of 'protector of the land' vibe, but really focused on the land, not the people. Some significant portion of the green sea could have been salt marsh lowlands in the days before the fall, even some parts of the Western Gulf, which was maybe more an inlet. Lizardfolk during the battles were more support than front line, and not nearly as many died as the elves. But they lost a lot of their homeland, and many left, perhaps for the southeast coast (most plausible place for a pantanaal) or even the southern continent. So lizardfolk in the northwest have kind of a 'the ones who stayed' vibe. But also, they have lifespans only somewhat longer than humans, so for them much of this would still be ancient memory. Anyway, just thinking. Lizardfolk could stand to be a bit distinct from stoneborn.

Right so dwarves have kingdoms and such, but from the perspective of Sembara and the elves at least, what do you think of the following:

  

a) the central mountains have always been the center of dwarven civilization and  are probably something of a 'dwarven homeland' (making dwarves a major early influence on some of the highland kingdoms, who have always been on the fringes of dwarven life)

b) there certainly are other dwarven kingdoms out there -- from a Sembara standpoint the only one that likely matters is in the Vostok mountain ranges, but you might see dwarves traveling from their homeland south to the Yuvanti mountains as well. So for example in my Clenseau town I'm developing for the starting point of my campaign I'm eventually going to run, dwarven caravans moving through wouldn't be unheard of, heading specifically to the Yuvanti mountains. And in Tollen say you might see dwarves from the Vostok area and the main kingdoms of the central mountains. What other dwarven civs are out there can be left somewhat undeveloped, but there are probably a reasonable number. 

c) in the ancient days, dwarves had massive underground kingdoms, especially in the north, and a lot was lost during the downfall. But unlike the elves, this wasn't a devastation of the dwarf people themselves -- but it does set up Moria-like places, which are cool from a game setting perspective to have places to fight monsters. And the dwarves retained their major holdings in the central part of the central mountains.

Right, I remember the high school vibe, which I've always liked. I actually created a stoneborn like race for a game I ran a while ago that was mostly ungendered and had complex family rituals around not being born but actually being carved from stone. I forward you my write up, we can certainly steal anything appealing for Taelgar. But for the 'wide sweep of elven and human history' story, it seems reasonable that the stoneborn are always on the edges. Where and how they appear is really a campaign and story specific situation, but they do not form kingdoms or empires or large communities, and they have just always been rare. There was no great downfall or earlier history with significant meaning.

I was thinking more that rather than spreading very widely (even at the height, there are only a million of them), they have two proper empires, and then a lot of outposts, many of which were specifically built and oriented around protecting 'civilization' from the orcs/shadowfell/dragons/giants/etc, but all connected via the Feywild or something else, so they are very much a unified culture. So not so much 'there are elves in every forest', which I think is kinda uninteresting, but 'the elves established two major empires, spanning the continent, and these were magic forests planted by their god'. But then their empires collapsed and they retreated. Still playing with ideas here, but I had a few thoughts:

a) the Cymean elvish outpost is actually a fragment of the original ancient forest kingdom, the only one that survived. So it is kinda an important elvish site, and probably the oldest inhabited place on earth. Definitely magical.

b) maybe one or two outputs of the southern empire survived as well, but not going to make them up now

c) a major part of the elvish world withdrew in grief, and made hidden cities in empty lands. This would be where the elves in the forests on the west slopes of the central mountains came from, for example, but probably several other places like this

d) some of the scattered elvish outputs survived the downfall, and maybe grew into small communities

  

At the end of the Great War, a lot of the elves from the (c) strand 'come out of hiding' and participate. And then die. So you have kinda four strands in elvish life now

  

1. The elves living in the ancient remains of the ancient empires. This is where the handful of elves who still remember creation probably live, and although mystical, weird, and hidden, maintain much of the ancient belief that elves are the protectors of the world

2. The elves who withdrew after the downfall, and did not reemerge for the Great War. These are very closed, hidden. Probably culturally diverging and not interested in outsiders. Might spend most of their time in other planes. Could have powerful magic and other weird stuff.

3. The elves who re-emerged after the Great War who are the biggest source of the "outward turn" elves. These folks are driving the idea that the other two elvish ideals (#1 = go it alone, #2 = withdraw) are wrong, and elves must work with the other races, and in particular humans

4. A strand of 'lost elves', various elvish groups, in small outposts at the end of the downfall, who never re-entered the elven mainstream.  A good source for regionally and campaign specific characters. There could be a group of elves kinda anywhere, living in very small communities, from these strands. But I could imagine a group of elves, living in the northern taiga since the downfall, organized into a military order dedicated to hunting orcs, for example. LIkely still have some of the cultural 'defenders' vibe, not like the hidden elves, who, after two disasters, have firmly retreated into ancient magic and whatnot.

I think ultimately having a D&D world draw some parallels and inspiration from Tolkien is totally fine. If you were trying to publish a book, maybe it would make sense to shake it up more, but I think all of the races have enough unique points (including the specifics of the collapse of the elven empires) that it feels inspired by Tolkien, but not  boringly derivative of him. I don't mind that ultimately, the Tolkien elf is not a crazy mental model for what elves are like, and the Tolkien dwarf is not a bad mental model for dwarves. It is so seeped into the D&D culture that it's what players assume anyway....

Anyway, just thinking. Lizardfolk could stand to be a bit distinct from stoneborn. 

I actually like this idea, and I think it helps distinguish them from the stoneborn. If the entire western gulf is marshland, and that is the main lizardfolk kingdom during the elder days, perhaps in the downfall, as the marshes dry up, you have a great migration: some lizardfolk head west, and settle amongst the western lands. But the bulk of them head south, and are lost. There is no sundering like the dwarves -- but there is a sense within the lizardfolk in the north (i.e. north of the great desert) that a great part of their people have left. And then the marshy bits around Sembara are in fact the remenants of the original lizardfolk homeland.

  

This kinda sets up the Greater Sembara region as 'elder race creation zone', but given the high school game mythology around Ulrich monastery, that might make sense.

It also sets up the south as potentially having very different variants of some of the elder races (the gnomes, of course, but also maybe the lost lizardfolk have developed very differently, and the elves of the southern empire that survived the downfall have developed their own traditions and are very different from northern elves, and so on. Or maybe there are no elves in the south, as their southern empire was right were the continent is ripped in half, and basically, they all died. Lots of possibilities, but most of them would not look like: and the elder races spread over the entire world and there are more of the same in the south).

Yes, (a) is definitely right. And still in the current day, the majority (although perhaps now a bare majority, not an overwhelming one) are from there. 

  

And (b) is good too, although I think dwarves are less likely to make really long journeys, especially overland, as a lot of dwarven internal trade runs through the long roads they build underground. In Sembara, you'd probably have a lot of dwarven "internal" trade running through the highlands towards Vostok mountains, which definitely have dwarves, mostly launching from the northernmost dwarven kingdoms. Around the destroyed Ulrich monastery the long roads no longer are used, so trade south would usually go overland around the Ardlas/Lavnoch. Not sure if there is a remnant dwarven community south of the Urlich death zone. Perhaps yes, maybe into the hills and highlands. Could also be small communities in the coastal Vostok mountains northeast of Tollen, perhaps associated with crafting and artisanry in particular; if so there would be dwarven caravans crossing Sembara with some regularity from central mountains to there. Dwarven trade to Yuvanti may actually be more likely to go under the mountains and then south, rather than skirt the desolation of Cha'mutte. 

  

For (c), in many ways the dwarves lost more in the fall of Cha'mutte than the downfall. The destruction of Urlich monastery basically depopulated the entire southern part of the central mountains, and wars in the west depopulated most of the dwarves living on the coastal mountains directly west of the Sembaran highlands. But yes, in neither case the dwarves were really devastated as a people -- after Hkar, probably some managed retreat from the far northern mountains and perhaps the deeper caverns; after Cha'mutte a bit more central devastation and death but still most got out to settle new places. Indeed this could be the source of new Dwarven populations in more marginal (from a dwarvish perspective) land in Sembara, e.g. near Tollen and the Mostreve hills, at least west of the gap. More dwarves not living in deep, ancient caves more cities partially above ground, and with less of the ancient halls of our forefathers vibe.

Right, I think this is what I was thinking too. 

 > many of which were specifically built and oriented around protecting 'civilization' from the orcs/shadowfell/dragons/giants/etc, but all connected via the Feywild or something else, so they are very much a unified culture.Yeah. In general I really dislike the idea of teleportation circles, and while I will definitely allow teleportation I don't intend to have specific teleportation circles that make teleportation easy in standard D&D. But transporting via the planes is always possible, and elves have always had both strong magic and a fey connection, so I can easily see the ancient empires of the elves being really spread out, perhaps even with some cities that are part on Taelgar and part in the Feywild.  
 > So not so much 'there are elves in every forest', which I think is kinda uninteresting, but 'the elves established two major empires, spanning the continent, and these were magic forests planted by their god'. But then their empires collapsed and they retreated. Still playing with ideas here, but I had a few thoughts:

It might make sense to have the northwestern elven empire then spread from Dunmar northeast along the river valley/Irebor and end more or less in the Mostreve hills and Cymean highlands. So the Cymean elvish outpost would have been kind of the borderlands of the old empire, which was really centrally in Dunmar and what is now the desolation of Cha'mutte. Then, the southern empire would be somewhere south of the desert and unimportant for campaigns right now but kind of in the wings for unusual / atypical elves, should the need arise.

  

The western forests certainly don't have to have been ancestrally (pre-Hkar) inhabited by elves, but do need an elven presence by the time when Drankor is expanding. I think this being where many of the survivors fled to hide makes a ton of sense. Plenty of other spots that can have this vibe too as needed. 

  

But in general I like the basic framework.

Ignoring those who may or may not be south of the desert, I think the major place for this in current day Taelgar is the Cymean foothills and forests, the kingdom I've called Orenlas. 

 > 2. The elves who withdrew after the downfall, and did not reemerge for the Great War. These are very closed, hidden. Probably culturally diverging and not interested in outsiders. Might spend most of their time in other planes. Could have powerful magic and other weird stuff.

Lurking at need for a story, but by definition would not be placed in obvious ways on the map. Good thing to have around, though. But probably Delwath, although he'd know of these elves, would not know where they live.

Many of these elves would now live in the western coast forests, against the central mountains, but there could easily be 2-4 main areas of settlement of this type, none of which beyond Delwath's homeland are really important right now. 

  

I think most elves 'in the world' in the current day would be of this type. Although in Sembara you may get a bit more of the #1 elves.

Yes, I like this a lot. Like #2 these would not need to be put on a map or developed right now, beyond the fact that they exist. 

  > > One option would be that there were vast lizardfolk kingdoms in the elder days, and they also, like elves, had a bit of 'protector of the land' vibe, but really focused on the land, not the people. Some significant portion of the green sea could have been salt marsh lowlands in the days before the fall, even some parts of the Western Gulf, which was maybe more an inlet. Lizardfolk during the battles were more support than front line, and not nearly as many died as the elves. But they lost a lot of their homeland, and many left, perhaps for the southeast coast (most plausible place for a pantanaal) or even the southern continent. So lizardfolk in the northwest have kind of a 'the ones who stayed' vibe. But also, they have lifespans only somewhat longer than humans, so for them much of this would still be ancient memory. Anyway, just thinking. Lizardfolk could stand to be a bit distinct from stoneborn.

If the entire western gulf is marshland, and that is the main lizardfolk kingdom during the elder days, perhaps in the downfall, as the marshes dry up, you have a great migration: some lizardfolk head west, and settle amongst the western lands. But the bulk of them head south, and are lost. There is no sundering like the dwarves -- but there is a sense within the lizardfolk in the north (i.e. north of the great desert) that a great part of their people have left. And then the marshy bits around Sembara are in fact the remenants of the original lizardfolk homeland.

Or maybe there are no elves in the south, as their southern empire was right were the continent is ripped in half, and basically, they all died. Lots of possibilities, but most of them would not look like: and the elder races spread over the entire world and there are more of the same in the south).

I was actually thinking it might be more interesting to turn this around, and have the major lizardfolk homeland be in great swamps and marshes on the south coast of the Green Sea, north of what is now the desert. This would be a natural buffer for the "neo-easterners" in the east/north and the "old easterners" in the west, who kind of don't leave much of a trace except in the Skaer. Sembara would be a major outpost, but not the homeland. Then when the climate changes and the seas rise and the desert appears, this part of the coast dries up and the lizardfolk leave -- some heading west, only to find that Sembara is no longer the wide swamps it once was either, and others making the long trek south to who knows where. 

  

Like elves, I have this idea that lizardfolk use magic somehow (communicate in dreams?) and so don't really diverge that much, unless at some point I want a group of lizardfolk who have forsaken the others.

I like the idea, for my campaign, of having Clenseau be a place where dwarves cross through regularly. From the map, it might make sense if the usual dwarven route to the south goes down the long road to Ardlas, through southern Ardlas and the western marches, south along the Great Road through Marseau, and then rejoining the long road in the gap in the Mostreve hills, where the central mountains jut out. Perhaps there is a dwarven community in the hills there, although one of the ideas around the Free Republic of Ausberg was that the mineral wealth was easy to get to from all the abandoned mines in the region. So maybe the desolation from Ulrich really goes much farther south...

  

The idea would be that underground, the desolation of the Ulrich blast spreads somewhat farther north and south than shown on the map, and in particular, nowhere in the mountains on the borders of the western marches is safe, even underground. So the dwarves have to go the long way round to pick up safe passage.

In general I really dislike the idea of teleportation circles, and while I will definitely allow teleportation I don't intend to have specific teleportation circles that make teleportation easy in standard D&D. But transporting via the planes is always possible, and elves have always had both strong magic and a fey connection, so I can easily see the ancient empires of the elves being really spread out, perhaps even with some cities that are part on Taelgar and part in the Feywild.  
> 

I actually have mixed feelings on the Feywild thing. I like the idea of some lost elves, and why would they be lost (except by choice) if the Feywild was so easy to travel through. Maybe in newer ages, the Feywild has grown wilder, and it is harder for elves to just cross the continent in a day through it, like they used to in the days before the coming of the humans. So although historically elves were unified, in the last couple thousand years, harder to move back and forth between places. Totally agree on teleportation -- although I remember teleporting around the world was a key component of our high school game.

Yeah, this is what I was going for.

Right. And maybe it was mostly destroyed. Or not. Doesn't matter, but whatever sundered the continent could have been an attack on the elven empire in the south, which worked. That might even up the death rate for elves though.

 > The western forests certainly don't have to have been ancestrally (pre-Hkar) inhabited by elves, but do need an elven presence by the time when Drankor is expanding. I think this being where many of the survivors fled to hide makes a ton of sense. Plenty of other spots that can have this vibe too as needed. 

Yeah, I figure Delwath is from the western forests, and it was a major place of retreat and hiding during the Drankorian years. But Delwath is young and wouldn't remember the debates about hiding versus helping with the Great War. Although it occurs to me one interesting thing about the elvish generation structure is that young elves have a very large number of grandparents. It would be pretty common to know your 3rd or 4th great grandparents. Although they'd also have so many kids, maybe there isn't a huge sense of parental bonding. Maybe an elf really develops a sense of family around their age mates, more than anything else.

Right. Although I think even in this 'new' elvish communities in the western forests, not all of them would be the 'outward' facing elves. But the communities as a whole wouldn't be fanatically hidden like the #2 lurking elves.

I'm not sure exactly where Clenseau is supposed to be, but imaging it is basically on the eastern edge of Dunfry, due north of the gap, then I can certainly see dwarven caravans passing through regularly. Dwarven caravans to Yuvanti would have two options, neither great. One would be to emerge from the mountains in the western, in the great forests on the eastern edge of the Chardonian empire, and then travel 500 miles through the dense forest wilderness before emerging on the edge of Chardon and turning south for the 800 mile trip to the northern edge of the Yuvanti. The other would be to travel in Sembara south of Urlich, via Clenseau, and then take either the surface road or the long road underground south to Dunmar, and then through Dunmar. Either is a reasonable choice, so dwarven caravans through Clenseau certainly seems plausible. 

  

In general, I think the devastation of Urlich extends further south than north, and probably further south underground than above ground. There are probably few dwarves still living in the mountains between Urlich and Dunmar. Whether the occasional trade caravan uses the underground passages that go under the mountains and emerge north of the Myraeni Gap is an open question, of course, but it probably wouldn't be common.

 > (Although if the long road through Raven's Hold is still in use, wouldn't we have seen signs? But maybe there are many branches of it, or the dwarves pass through quitely)

You didn't look too hard, but certainly there was no sign that Inakara and her ilk were regularly encountering dwarves. So if any dwarves did pass through from the north, they did so quietly and without attracting attention -- certainly not a large trade caravan. That said, Raven's Hold is pretty far east and there may be other passages that emerge further west, north of Tokra, that would be more frequently used. Would still require passage through Clenseau, though.

Totally agree on teleportation -- although I remember teleporting around the world was a key component of our high school game.

Yes, definitely since the fall of Hkar controlling the other planes has gotten more difficult, or some key magic has been lost, or both. I am imagining this more in the Elder days than now, so that in the chaos of the downfall of Hkar and the wars, many elves could have gotten 'cut off' involuntarily. But in the mythic past they would be unified. 

  

On teleportation - yes, I think that allowing high level mages to teleport 1/day with an ever-present risk of accidentally going somewhere you don't want, in circumstances of dire need, works fine. I just don't like teleportation circles, which make teleportation risk-free and relatively speaking easy. Teleportation should always be something of a gamble.

Maybe an elf really develops a sense of family around their age mates, more than anything else. 

I definitely think the elven sense of family is strongly tied to age mates and maybe direct parents. The elven population is small enough and has few enough generations that many elves would be related in some way, and if you were an elf who decided to stay in the world, there is some chance that a large fraction of the current age set would be your direct or indirect descendants. So I don't think elves would really conceptualize grandparents, great-grandparents, even uncles and aunts, as relatives. You'd have parents, age-mates, "kin", and "strangers" as your basic family categories.
