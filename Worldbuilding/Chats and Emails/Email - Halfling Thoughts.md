I am thinking that part of why Halflings make things work trading-wise is that in established kingdoms and the civilized world, routes, risks, and costs are pretty well understood. So a caravan doesn't have to make a killing, they just have to keep on making comfortable and consistent profits. I imagine that this is different in different parts of the world, but that trade around most of the Green Sea, or trade between Chardon and Dunmar is pretty stable. I'm thinking, too, about Halfling trade in those parts of the world being more like a guild structure, where every boat or caravan is its own independent operation, but they also operate in concert with each other to do things like fix (generally) the price of passengers, and share commodity rates between cities. So, the boat coming back from Chardon having sold a load of grain might record the prices in the halfling trade hall, or inn. 

  

Those Inns on regular routes should have lending libraries associated with specific routes. That you can borrow a book from the Chardon-Darba shelf and return it in either city. Maybe that's more of a Green Sea thing where there are so many more standardized trade routes.

  

In fact, maybe the Halfling-only "Inns" function more like a guildhall in addition to an Inn. That's where Halflings might go for jobs, or to keep track of comings and goings, mail, and prices, as well as sharing stories. Oh -- that might also explain why we didn't see Halfling caravans on the road between Tokra and Darba: the information about dangers on that road would have been shared efficiently with anyone passing through. Halflings in the "civilized world" being risk-averse traders would also fit with Wellby's wanderlust that pulled him away from family.  

  

Maybe there's an insurance system for the ships also: the product of aversion to risk and its inevitability. Part of what keeps Halfling commerce from being ended by one bad storm season.

  

I'm thinking a Halfling ship might feel different than a human ship because of telepathy. I imagine that any orders would be spoken out loud (since many people would need to hear them), but that there wouldn't be much private conversation spoken aloud. Hmm: maybe that telepathy sort of solves for all one-to-one conversation, and the stuff you'd hear out loud would be more of a one-to-many conversation -- things like stories, songs, jokes, music. Maybe there's some influence there in Halfling culture around music and story as the main forms of artistic expression: that they're one-to-many communications.

  

I wonder what shipbuilding is like for halflings. Whether they have their own builders or designers, or maybe there are halfling-specific shipwrights who only (or largely) do work for halflings. I like the idea that there is a distinctive look to a Halfling ship -- it has to be sized for a three-foot crew while still having the cargo capacity to compete with human-sized ships. Are there more crew? more automation? a different shape below the waterline?

  

I like the idea of Halfling ships being run on a shares system, like a whaling ship, rather than just pay in coin. You probably wouldn't see halfling sailors on a human ship (not as common sailors, maybe as navigators, cooks, or carpenters) which makes for a weird job market: that Halflings mostly only work on Halfling ships. Maybe the ships are much more like caravans -- they're generational communities rather than a job which only the adults go to. That would bear on ship design also: that you've got old elders, and little babies, and everyone in between. That also suggests more of a joint-ownership, joint-pay model than a pay-for-hire approach. Maybe that's also part of the weirdness of Wellby wanting to go off on his own -- he's stepping outside that system. It would also speak to his sort of blase attitude toward money and things found: giving a lot of stuff away rather than accumulating it. I sort of like this line of thought for the way it makes Halflings more like communitarian families operating within a capitalist system rather than arch-capitalist traders. I wonder if it also aligns them better with the other elder races -- or at least the way Dwarves in Taelger (in my limited experience) feel more like a single family than they feel like whole cities teeming with people at cross-purposes.

  

Maybe there's a way in which the ships are specifically modeled after caravans, or even that they are modular: you take off the wheels and axles and drop in a caravan "box" container-like which forms the living quarters at one end. That would be an interesting take on containerization also -- the cargo isn't necessarily containerized, but the living quarters might be. Maybe that goes the other way too: even in land-route caravans, the tradition is to keep everything tied down or tied up in the same sort of nets you'd use at sea.

I definitely like the idea of "communitarian families operating within a capitalist system", and I love the thoughts about the impact of telepathy. Definitely agree that music and stories could be so prominent in halfling culture because of their centrality in one-many communication (and because they cannot really be replicated by telepathy). On a ship I also think telepathy would have surprising effects, e.g. no need to pass the word for someone if you can just message them. Definitely the case that halfling ships would operate on a shares system, and almost exclusively have only halfling crew (since halflings would typically function more efficiently on ships designed for them - and you can pack more bunks in with tighter spacing between the decks, for example). 

  

I think the nature of the crew would vary between Wellby's experience in the Western Gulf (the inner part of the Green Sea between Tollen, Cymea, and Sembara) and the Chardon coast. In the Western Gulf, you are almost never more than 2 days from land, storms are rare, and ships are really basically like generational caravans. You would have many folks too old or too young to work on the relatively safe, relatively easy voyages of the Western Gulf, and the regular, short cargo routes and plenty of time in port would make the guild structure you describe work. 

  

But, the Western Gulf of the Green Sea is only about 140,000 square miles (about 350 miles by 400 miles), whereas in the west, you are talking about a trading network centered on Chardon that extends at least 1500 miles north (to the northern side of Mawar, and even beyond), and more than 1000 miles south (to Nayahar). So the distances involved are much, much longer, journeys are a lot more dangerous, and space for food and water is more precious. In the real world it is kind of like the difference between trade in the Aegean, and trade in the North Atlantic and the North Sea. So here I think it would be less likely for lots of non-crew halflings to be hanging around ships, and while many of the crew of a ship might be related / share a family name, you probably don't have the same sense of a ship being a clan, the way a caravan is a clan. Because ships aren't owned by any one person (the captain might not even have the most shares in the ship), you'd have ownership drift over time as sailors age out and new ones join the crew.   

  

I imagine that part of this culture would also be more shore communities of halflings on the Western coast, since there is some amount of flow between ships and land. Sometimes people who are born on a land caravan would leave for the sea; but often a family that is involved in the sea trade would also perhaps own an inn in port, and there would be a fair bit of exchange back and forth. Or maybe there are halfling houseboat communities, or fishing villages, where people tend to flow to and from over the course of their lives (and of course not everyone becomes a sailor).

  

So I can imagine Wellby finding some aspects of the ship deeply familiar, e.g. the way that ownership is structured, the role of telepathy and music, the role of inns as guildhalls (although probably a bit less organized than in the Western Gulf). But other things might seem very strange - no babies on board, and few or no elders / kids (perhaps a couple young folk training as navigators, but not whole families); less direct kinship among the crew and more 'found' kinship; a design that is more streamlined and seaworthy (although even this ship is not a true 'blue water' ship, like the traders that cross the Sea of Storms to bring back exotic goods from the south). 

  

Anyway, food for thought.
