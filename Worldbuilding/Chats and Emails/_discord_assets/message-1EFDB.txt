Title: A Fool’s Fortune
Scene: The Goblin Market of Whispers

Setting: A garish, ever-shifting bazaar in the Feywild. Stalls are made of moth-wing awnings, mushroom caps, and bones lashed with vines. Goods glitter falsely—coins are leaves, jewels are insect husks, wine is rainwater. The air hums with faint laughter. A sign reads “Deals Honored, Prices Unseen” in glowing moss. Above, a crescent moon grins like a knife.

CHARACTERS:

ALDEMAR VOSS: A middle-aged merchant from Drankor, pompous and perpetually sweaty. Wears a velvet coat (now moth-eaten) and clutches a ledger he calls “The Book of Certainties.”

PUCKERLIME: A fey goblin marketeer with a lichen-green grin and a pocketwatch that ticks backward. Sells “investments.”

THE SHADE-SISTER: A veiled fey spirit who “audits” fortunes. Her shadow devours gold.

CHORUS OF WILL-O’-WISPS: Tiny, mocking lights that echo dialogue in reverse.

[Scene opens with ALDEMAR stumbling into the market, disoriented. His ledger glows faintly—a protective charm from Drankor’s Society of Unveiled Accounts, a secret order of merchant-mages. The WILL-O’-WISPS swarm, giggling.]

WILL-O’-WISPS (in unison, singsong)
Lost ledger, lost wits, what’s profit when the scale’s rigged?

ALDEMAR (brandishing his ledger)
Silence, spectral riffraff! I am Aldemar Voss, High Factor of the Drankor Mercantile Nexus! I don’t lose—I leverage.

[PUCKERLIME slithers from a stall, holding a contract written on birch bark.]

PUCKERLIME (sycophantic bow)
Ah, a Drankor man! We adore your kind. So… invested in outcomes. Care to buy a share of the Moon’s Reflection? Pays dividends in wishes!

ALDEMAR (squinting at the contract)
Wishes? Hmph. What collateral?

PUCKERLIME (licking his teeth)
A trifle: the weight of your shadow.

ALDEMAR (chuckling, dipping quill into ink)
Shadows are free. Let’s say… ten shares.

[He signs. The WILL-O’-WISPS swarm his shadow, which thins. Unseen, his ledger’s “Assets” page bleeds ink.]

ALDEMAR (to himself, triumphant)
Finally, a market unshackled by Drankor’s tiresome Regulations on Incorporeal Equities!

[THE SHADE-SISTER drifts forward, her veil made of cobwebs. She places a hand on his ledger. It rattles.]

THE SHADE-SISTER (hollow voice)
A audit, sir. Your fortune… lacks substance.

ALDEMAR (snatching the ledger back)
Substance? I’ve tripled my holdings since breakfast!

THE SHADE-SISTER (pointing to a stall)
Then buy the Locket of Last Year’s Breath. It whispers tomorrow’s prices.

ALDEMAR (peering at the locket)
How much?

THE SHADE-SISTER
Your mother’s maiden name.

ALDEMAR (pausing, uneasy)
That’s… hardly currency.

PUCKERLIME (whispering)
Names have no worth here—unless you cling to them.

[Aldemar’s ledger flashes—a Society of Unveiled Accounts sigil—but he hesitates, then snarls.]

ALDEMAR
“Vossaria.”

[The locket snaps open, screeching like a bird. THE SHADE-SISTER’s shadow unfurls, stealing “Vossaria” from the ledger’s margins. Aldemar doesn’t notice.]

ALDEMAR (grinning, listening to the locket)
“Buy”… “Buy all”… YES!

[He empties his purse (full of dead leaves) onto a stall, grabbing a “deed” to a castle that’s a termite mound. The fey vendors erupt in silent laughter.]

PUCKERLIME (offering a goblet)
A toast! To Drankor’s shrewdest!

ALDEMAR (drinking deep; it’s swamp water)
To expansion!

[He freezes mid-toast. His coat’s embroidery unravels, thread by thread, weaving into PUCKERLIME’s pocketwatch. The WILL-O’-WISPS chant.]

WILL-O’-WISPS
Fortune’s fool, balance due—what’s subtracted from naught but you?

ALDEMAR (suddenly frail, but euphoric)
Can’t you see? I’ve won. I’m untouchable.

[THE SHADE-SISTER opens his ledger. The pages are blank. She offers him a pen.]

THE SHADE-SISTER
Sign again. Your life will suffice.

ALDEMAR (scrawling his name wildly)
Gladly! What’s life without legacy?

[Blackout. A single WILL-O’-WISP whispers:]
WILL-O’-WISP
Legacy’s weight… breaks the scale.
