Certainly! Here’s another scene from *A Fool’s Fortune*. This one plays into the Feywild’s mystical charm, the merchant’s gullibility, and Drankorian flair for intrigue and clever wordplay.

### *A Fool’s Fortune*  
**Act III, Scene 1: The Singing Pool**

*The stage is set with a shimmering pool at center stage, surrounded by luminous flowers and twisting, otherworldly trees. The air hums faintly with a melody that grows louder as the scene unfolds. **Estelis**, the merchant, stumbles in, clutching his satchel and looking both exhausted and exhilarated.*

**Estelis**  
*Panting, wiping his brow.*  
By all the gods, this land is a maze of wonders! A pool that sings, a melody as sweet as coin in the coffer. Surely, this is a place where fortunes gather!  

*A group of **nymphs** rises from the pool, their movements fluid and graceful. Their song intertwines, ethereal and haunting. They are clad in flowing garments of silver and green, and their eyes glint with mischief.*

**First Nymph**  
*Stepping forward, voice melodic.*  
Traveler bold, who treads where mortals fear,  
What brings you to our sacred sphere?  

**Estelis**  
*Straightening, with an air of importance.*  
I am Estelis of Cedrano, merchant of renown! I seek treasures rare, riches unseen by mortal eyes. And what is this I hear? A song so sweet, it must be the whisper of fortune itself!

**Second Nymph**  
*Laughing lightly.*  
Fortune, you say? Such a bold decree.  
But tell us, merchant, what can you offer we?

**Estelis**  
*Gesturing to his satchel with a grin.*  
What can I offer? Behold, a bounty fit for kings! Gold, gems, and rarest spices. Surely, a fair exchange for the wonders of this place.

**Third Nymph**  
*Smiling slyly, circling him.*  
Gold is cold, and gems but glass.  
What worth have they in waters vast?  
We deal in treasures no mortal can hold:  
The fleeting, the precious, the daringly bold.

**First Nymph**  
*Leaning in with a conspiratorial whisper.*  
Your fortune lies not in what you bear,  
But in what you leave behind, if you dare.  

*The nymphs rise higher from the pool, circling him with hypnotic grace. One holds out a shimmering vial, glowing faintly with a silvery light.*

**Second Nymph**  
Take this vial, a gift for your quest.  
It holds liquid song, of dreams the best.  
Pour it forth in the mortal lands,  
And watch as fortune blooms at your hands.

**Estelis**  
*Eyes alight with greed.*  
Liquid song, you say? A wonder such as this will make me a legend! What price must I pay for such a treasure?

**Third Nymph**  
*Smiling, voice smooth as silk.*  
No gold, no jewels—we seek none of these.  
A single drop of memory, if you please.

**Estelis**  
*Laughing heartily.*  
A drop of memory? You drive a hard bargain, but I accept. Take a trifle, and I shall take my fortune.

*The nymphs gather closer, one reaching out to gently touch his temple. Estelis stiffens briefly, then shakes his head as though clearing it.*

**First Nymph**  
The deal is struck. The vial is yours.  
May your dreams lead to open doors.  

*They hand him the vial, and he gazes at it with awe. The nymphs sink back into the pool, their song fading to a faint hum. As Estelis exits triumphantly, the lights dim, and the nymphs’ laughter echoes.*

**Third Nymph**  
*To the audience, with a sly smile.*  
He leaves lighter than he knows,  
For memories lost, the weight still grows.

### Notes:
1. **Irony:** Estelis believes he’s gained a magical treasure but has unknowingly given away a part of his memory—perhaps of his home or loved ones.
2. **Fey Trickery:** The nymphs never lie, but they play with his greed and hubris.
3. **Drankorian Flavor:** The lyrical, slightly ominous tone of the nymphs’ dialogue reflects the magical and mysterious culture of Drankor.
4. **The Journey Continues:** This sets up Estelis for further losses, as he unwittingly carries his "treasures" back into the Feywild, growing poorer with every exchange.
