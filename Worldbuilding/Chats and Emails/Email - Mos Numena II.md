(Aug 2021)

So, two bits of Mos Numena that are going to come up next session, that I'd be curious if you have any more specific thoughts about Mos Numena funeral rites.

  

Feast days (the other topic on my mind) is pretty well covered in the Eight Divines doc -- I have a pretty good idea of the basics around remembrance of miracles with a lot of storytelling and reenactments. And the mechanics of course would be that in a place like Clenseau, where the town is dedicated to the warlord, the feast days would all be celebrating the warlord and the various miracles he has granted.

  

Funerals I'm less clear on so any thoughts you have would be great.

===============

I have a few random thoughts about this.

  

One, thinking about the implications of game mechanics for world building, I've occasionally thought about the 10 day limit for Raise Dead and considered if there should be some kind of metaphysical interpretation of that ("the soul is still on its way to its final resting place and so is easier to reach") kind of thing. This feels very Drankorian in origin, and I think potentially the Drankorian tradition might originally involve embalming/preserving bodies and having some kind of "waiting period" almost that concludes with burial or cremation after 10 days (probably burial for the rich, cremation for the poor). There would probably be traditions about prayers and ritual acts to ease the soul's journey to the afterlife and all that. Then I can see the funeral being kind of a celebration of the life of the dead person more than morning, the idea being you mourn your loss during the soul's journey but then you celebrate the dead when they arrive. 

  

Now, because bodies will start to decompose before 10 days this would only be practical with ready access to magic (e.g. I presume Gentle Repose stops putrefaction) or if the first stage is some kind of preservation/embalming (although going back to Raise Dead, of course if you take out all the internal organs you can't be raised from the dead anymore). But this doesn't seem insurmountable, and many kinds of embalming are common in real history.

  

So if you imagine the original Mos Numena / Drankorian funeral practices are something like an initial ritual mourning period that concludes with a funeral and a celebration (in Drankor this would probably include things like a wake/parade of the dead type event), then could spin variations of that for various strands of Mos Numena.

  

The question for Sembara is should it just be a "normal" evolution of this kind of idea, perhaps less grandiose than the Drankorian embalming / 10 days of rituals / big funeral and public celebration but still in the same vein and with the same theological underpinning of the pre-burial period being the time to guide the soul on its journey to the afterlife. Or should it draw more from Kestavo type traditions. 

  

I do like the idea of Sembara as having cemeteries and churchyards, which implies burial instead of cremation, or at least a mix of both, and I definitely don't see Sembara as a funeral pyre type culture like Dunmar. 

  

Another idea I had is to borrow the idea from the Curse of Chalion about seeing which god takes up your soul, especially given that the Eight Divines are derived in some ways from that religion. This could be at the conclusion of the 10 days of mourning at the beginning of the funeral itself, or perhaps at the very beginning as soon as possible after death, as a way to guide / structure the journey and mourning period. I think this could work in particular in Sembara were most people would have at least one and often several personal connections to different gods, via their town/village patron, their personal patron, and whatever organizational patrons they may have as well. This could also function as a tie-in to Kestavan traditions, where the local spirit might be seen as shepherding the soul to the afterlife. Although I kind of think the Kestavan tradition would involve more sacrifice / grave goods given that the small gods are not seen as nearly as powerful as e.g. the Eight Divines and so may need help / encouragement to get the soul to the right place. 

  

Anyway some thoughts to play around with.

===========

A few quick thoughts…

  

I like the idea of the kestavo tradition having a strong sense of place, and so burial in the small gods sacred space becomes this important step for souls to be able to be brought back to the gods realm (metaphysically what actually happens given the kestavo don’t have realms is an open question). Probably this would be done rapidly, but maybe with some graveside ceremony 10 days later. Kinda like the Jewish traditions of rapid burial, sitting shiva, and unveiling but on a very different timeline. 

  

This then merged with the Drankorian tradition to end up with a Sembaran view where you have the preparing of the body and the mourning period with perhaps some ceremonies around that, and then a formal burial in the churchyard/sacred space, borrowing from the kestavo tradition. 

  

I don’t love copying the Chalion idea here as that is pretty distinctive in itself and feels unsatisfying to add it straight to Taelgar.  I also like the idea of the physical place being seen as important, from the kestavo tradition. And so many communities would only have a single temple, and therefore only one place. 

  

One idea is what if the sembaran tradition is that each soul is always granted two miracles — the miracle at birth, when the soul enters the world (but which is invisible), and the miracle at death when the god takes up the soul. Usually, the god of the community, whoever that is, takes up the soul. But in rare circumstances maybe they don’t— and so the family would be forced to find the right god and right temple to take it up. 

  

So in say Clenseau (the patron god of which is the warlord), most people would be taken up by the warlord and buried in the churchyard. Some might be cremated and then buried to save space, or buried without a marker. 

  

But some rare times, a soul would not be taken up by the warlord for whatever reason… and then the family would have to find somewhere else. 

  

This who thing could be a function of the temples, as part of the embalming/preparing the body. The soul isn’t taken up then, but the divine is opening a door for the soul. And after the period of mourning when the body is buried in the hallowed ground, the soul is taking up by the divine. 

  

So in sembara, you’d still have the drankorian two rites, but the first rite would involve opening the door, and the second burying the body and seeing the soul go through the door basically.  Probably the first bit is more private and the second the communal one. Also probably the gods grant a visual sign of some kind thst the door was opened. So kinda the chalion idea but more flexible, ie it isn’t a mystery about which god, rather you are expecting god A and have to scramble if A doesn’t open the door. 

  

Anyway I’ll try to put something a little less steam of consciousness together tomorrow.

  

The 10 day thing is going to mess with my timeline a little bit though but that’s ok

=============

I like this. I actually think the idea that humans are granted two miracles, of birth and of death, should be an old Hkaran idea, probably dating back to the first creation of humans. Obviously evolved in different strands of religious history, but a universal shared thing. 

  

In my "secret" other planes document I've been playing around a bit with what happens to souls when they die and have this:

### The River of Souls

When a consciousness, or soul, dies, it fades from the [[Plane of Souls]], but does not immediately disappear into nothingness. Most (although not all) instead drift towards the Land of the Dead, which has many names and many descriptions in different cultures, human and non-human alike. Here, the souls of the dead drift, waiting. Some, those who are not claimed by any god or being of similar power, eventually fade away into nothingness, becoming part of the essence of the place itself. Others are taken up into spiritual realms.

  

In game mechanical terms, this has an impact on resurrection magic. Weaker magic (revivify, raise dead, reincarnate) can only reach souls while they are still in the Land of the Dead. By default, it is assumed to take 10 days from death for a soul to depart the Land of the Dead for wherever it is going next, or to fade away, but role playing circumstances could change this. Stronger magic (resurrection, true resurrection, wish) is required to reach souls who have already left the Land of the Dead. Only true resurrection or wish can unravel souls who have faded from the fabric of the land of the dead and restore them. I started playing around with these ideas because I wanted a "land of the dead" but didn't want it to be the typical thing from Greek myth or from books like the Golden Compass triology (or Riverworld, or any number of other myths) where the land of the dead is teeming with dead spirits, I wanted something that was empty and barren and relatively small but had a steady stream of travelers. I did a few calculations and figured that with 10 days travel time and a world population on the order of 500 million humans, and with a global mortality rate per day of 30-40 per million (which is higher than current modern day but not a lot higher, so would be easy to push this up if desired to have a few more people in the Land of the Dead), you'd have in the low hundreds of thousands (175k or so) souls in the land of the dead at any time, basically a large city, not uncounted millions. 

  

Given the metaphysical reality of the process of a soul fading from the [[Plane of Souls|plane of consciousness]] upon death, and journeying for 10 days in the Land of the Dead until taken up into one of the "Outer Planes" or doomed to fade away, I think that would impact all human religions. 

  

There are actually two key points -- first, the transition from the [[Plane of Souls|plane of consciousness]] to the Land of the Dead. If this goes wrong, you get a ghost, or worse, so in a lot of cultures this might be the most significant one, and would imply rapid burial / cremation. This is kind of like the Dunmari ethos, because of the personal relationship with the gods they are not worried about the Dunmari siblings "finding" your soul in the land of the dead, instead they are worried about making sure your soul gets there. Hence the worry about the untended dead whose souls may be lost, wandering in the world and unable to pass over. 

  

The second is the transition from the Land of the Dead to the divine realm of whatever takes up the soul. Drankorian cultures would be much more concerned about this, about the final disposition of the soul, and I think especially in Chardon given the more transactional nature of religion there. I can also imagine a lot of the Northern folk religions having a kind of transactional idea about both transition points. Perhaps burying the body in the right place immediately ensures they get to the Land of the Dead, and then they are buried with sacred tokens, grave goods, etc to help them on the journey.

  

In Dunmar, there is an idea of two funerals, the first as soon as possible after death (cremation), and the second a communal service for all who died in a period of time. This is in part practical since as nomads it isn't like they can bring bodies back to a temple to be buried, but also reflects their religious sensibilities. You'll see the communal part of the funeral service (which is where signs from the gods indicate that the soul got where it should go in their culture) in a couple of sessions. 

  

Anyway, more food for thought.
