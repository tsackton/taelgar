In another my game topic, the lich's plan to destroy Sembara is coming into view.... 

Step 1: Cast a really powerful and hard to cast spell (took a year or two of prep) that caused a decent percent (1%?) of the dead in southern Sembara to rise up as zombies/skeletons/etc
Step 2: Absolutely and completely mismanage the response...

really minor point

The mismanagement involves things like imposing a wealth tax to raise an army, but doing so on halflings and lizardfolk as well as humans (which is not what sembaran law says)

Having some of his controlled barons (he only has a few) collect the tax twice

Mixing up the army and sending it various different places, so Fellburn stays under siege from a bunch of hobgoblin zombies through the winter,

Specifically trying to stir up the Duke of Wisford so he rebels


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
etc

Whatever my PCs do, a group of adventures is going to kill the lich in 6 months (July 1720) and things will get fixed after that


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
why does the lich want to destroy Sembara again?


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
or does it not matter for the campaign?


[1/2/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
It matters a lot for the 2nd part of the campaign, but not entirely sorted out. The short version is that he was a wizard with a desire for life extension, doing dubious research, the House of Sewick specifically destroyed his research/tried him for illegal magic, he escaped, vowed revenge on the House of Sewick


[1/2/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
So actually it is less about destroying Sembara than the House of Sewick specifically. Probably he is hoping one of the northern dukes will eventually organize a coup of some kind


[1/2/2024 10:56 PM] .deciusmus
I have a vague backstory but I need to work it out a little bit more, at the moment it is still a bit unclear, other than a personal vendetta against the House of Sewick for what he sees as ruining his life
