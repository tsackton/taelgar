Speaking of my game today, any thoughts on holy symbols for the Father and the Night Queen?
Thinking for the father:
Simplest - a line with a circle with rays  on top, representing a scepter with the sun at the top. More complex would include details of scepter sun

Night queen - five dots in a circle, representing the outline of a crown of stars. More complex would represent the crown (seen top down). Alternate sometimes seen: just three stars in an arch with an implied horizon, representing transition to and from the night/life/death

I like both of those. for night queen perhaps stylized stars not dots? as an amulet or holy symbol assume it would be a styled crown in general


[11/12/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah. Sounds good

In this case it will come up scrawled on walls as graffiti / ward against undead

what do you think of an eight-pointed seedling as a holy symbol of the mother? something kind of like: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1225080386766508075/1225083334397267998/rsulfuratus_Design_a_straightforward_and_iconic_symbol_for_a_fa_c42bfe41-365d-4031-8c22-17c2dd330294.png?ex=661fd6c3&is=660d61c3&hm=4298323e1fd2ebcbb21b45f9a333a632ef5ade66bf9e4679adebc47b57693e8f&

I like that


[4/3/2024 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
look in the #religions channel on Taelgarverse and let me know if you like any of the stained glass or paintings of The Mother

I do a fair bit of #1, ie if I’m making up a small village I won’t necessarily make pages for all the people.

Sibyls hall could just be text on the main university of Chardon page

I like the pregnant ones not in profile i.e. like  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1225080386766508075/1225123387618230342/rsulfuratus_A_medieval_fantasy_painting_that_shows_the_Mother_a_fb5536e2-349b-42e9-bb27-3b8aaccb7a40.png?ex=661ffc11&is=660d8711&hm=8faefb2fbb51091e4de3336ca7ee4df11100ae6ead50f9f47a1bb5b877f7535c& look a little too airbrushed or something. They lose some of the "everywoman" vibe (maybe the woman is too pretty? I'm not sure). There is just something I don't like as much

I actually liked the one you picked for obsidian, I think losing the circlet makes the pregnant one "fit" a bit better


[4/3/2024 4:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, okay, going to keep that, was just messing around with a few other variants

Eh. I don’t love either actually. I think the central figure looks too sinister.  I like the first one except the two little dots on her head look like creepy eyes to me

alternate night queen tapesty. was aiming for "mystery" more than "creeping" but don't want her face to be obviously visible.
