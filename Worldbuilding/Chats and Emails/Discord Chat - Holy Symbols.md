Speaking of my game today, any thoughts on holy symbols for the Father and the Night Queen?
Thinking for the father:
Simplest - a line with a circle with rays  on top, representing a scepter with the sun at the top. More complex would include details of scepter sun

Night queen - five dots in a circle, representing the outline of a crown of stars. More complex would represent the crown (seen top down). Alternate sometimes seen: just three stars in an arch with an implied horizon, representing transition to and from the night/life/death

I like both of those. for night queen perhaps stylized stars not dots? as an amulet or holy symbol assume it would be a styled crown in general

Yeah. Sounds good

In this case it will come up scrawled on walls as graffiti / ward against undead
