I sent you a long email one of my players wrote about her character‚Äôs backstory. One thing it makes me wonder is ‚Äî what do the gods and the fey think of
each other?


[3/21/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
Curious if you have any thoughts


[3/21/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
(The character is a multiclass cleric of the wyrdling / fey trickster rogue which is a homebrew variant of arcane trickster with the source of magic being fey)


[3/21/2024 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
Secondarily it makes me wonder what it‚Äôs actually like to cast a spell in taelgar. How do they fey grant magic?


[3/21/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
And how does being a wizard or sorcerer feel different from being a cleric?


[3/21/2024 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I saw the email just reading it now while I eat lunch


[3/21/2024 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the only fundamental thing about magic is that all magic in taelgar represents the manipulation of extranplanar forces in some way. there is a "magic in taelgar" note in worldbuilding/brainstorming


[3/21/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I have always thought of divine magic (whether technically a cleric or someone like Delwath who is not mechanically a cleric but gets magic from divine beings) as effectively just praying in a some kind of particular way


[3/21/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
(although Delwath is a bit weird here since early on he did not know the source of his power was a god)


[3/21/2024 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
you - as the spellcaster - aren't really doing anything, particularly, except opening a path for divine magic to reach the material plane


[3/21/2024 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
(this bit is pretty undeveloped but the basic idea is the [[Land of the Dead]] acts as kind of a barrier and gods cannot easily reach past it, but living souls allow them to "tunnel" in a way)


[3/21/2024 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
a wizard (or an "arcane-feeling" bard, like Seeker) would be basically manipulating residue leakage/energy from the plane of magic, represented by [[Ley Lines]]


[3/21/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
sorcerers and warlocks depend on the source of their magic. e.g., Cintra (divine soul sorcerer) was not manipulating residual energy of the plane of magic, she is a personal direct channel that allows Shakun to act through her


[3/21/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the echo realms in various forms (feywild, shadowfell, dreamworld, etc) were "spun out" from Taelgar almost by accident when the material plane was created by the High Gods during the Riving, and that act left resonaces / echos that can also be manipulated


[3/21/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
this is where fey magic, probably also primal magic, some forms of necromancy, etc comes from


[3/21/2024 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
this is probably somewhat in-between the cleric "I am a channel for a god to act" and the wizard "I can see and feel strands of arcane magic running across the world that I pull and twist to create spells"


[3/21/2024 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
as far as what the gods and the fey think of each other - I guess it would depend a lot on the individual fey, and perhaps the individual god. I don't think there needs to be a settled standard approach here. 

fey are ultimately the grandchildren of the High Gods, via the archfey. some archfey probably see themselves basically as gods themselves and might consider especially e.g. the embodied gods of the elves as peers. they might consider some of the weaker human gods (tanshi, kestavo) as effectively lesser than them


[3/21/2024 1:19 PM] rsulfuratus
one key point is the echo realms are actually harder to reach for the gods than the material plane (they are even further from the [[Divine Realms]]), so gods would be particularly weak in the echo realms


[3/21/2024 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/21/2024 1:20 PM] .deciusmus
That all makes sense, although when bounced against D&D rules there is a little question of why clerics have to prepare spells


[3/21/2024 1:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think from Celyn's perspective, the basic idea Kiya hinted at - where the fey magic feels like work and the divine magic feels like a gift - fits pretty well


[3/21/2024 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
3 of the 4 characters in my game have the fey touched feat, so there is a a second question I'm trying to answer about how is that different from other magic (although only Kiya of my 4 players seems interested in delving into what it feels like to cast spells in Taelgar)


[3/21/2024 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yes - I like the "misty step is something you have to work at to learn to do" angle


[3/21/2024 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean from a overarching point of view I think the key thing to decide is "what extraplanar energy are you manipulating" and "how are you doing it". with possible answers for the first one ranging from "plane of magic" to "feywild" to "[[Plane of Souls]] (this is probably psionics)" to "[[Divine Realms]]" and many things in between


[3/21/2024 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
how you are doing it could be anything from "arcane rituals" to "prayers"


[3/21/2024 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
basically to cast a spell you need a) a power source and b) a way to manipulate / manifest that power source in the material plane


[3/21/2024 1:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense.


[3/21/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but, to take the cleric example, you could imagine all of the following "divine magic users":
- a person born with an innate connection to a particular god, whose soul/spirit/consciousness functions as a conduit allowing the divine energy of the deity to effortlessly flow to the material plane, requiring only that the person learn how to shape the power flowing through them (a divine soul sorcerer)
- a Lakan mystai who has studied the secret prayers and rituals of Laka and learned how to manipulate the resonances of the prayers that flow across the material plane (a wizard)
- a character like Riswynn who is a very traditional "pray to the gods" cleric
- a character like Delwath who I'm not actually sure exactly how he casts spells but it usually feels more like asking for a favor from a particular spirit than praying I think

all those people could be manipulating divine magic in various ways, with very different mechanics

anyway I have a meeting now but maybe I'll update the magic in taelgar notes later today


[3/21/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I was thinking about Delwath, I think he has a specific relationship with the tanshi and has almost worked together with each one to craft special abilities. 

So asking for a favor works pretty well as a vibe, but I think he has additionally basically collaborated with each tanshi so that there are these specific favors from each one that work well


[3/21/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
doing a little note cleanup. why did you have the eight divines tagged status/tim? maybe just the symbols for the father and the night queen?


[3/21/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I think so


[3/21/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm taking the status/tim tags off them

writing next session - wondering about Delwath's general scrying patterns. assume that, since arriving in Zvervinka, you are not trying to secertly scry in your rooms at night or anything, but let me know if that is not the case. prior to arriving, assume Delwath generally keeps an eye on Chardon, Sura/Karnas, maybe Xurkhaz, but isn't deeply scrying one person unless you tell me


[3/23/2024 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
That sounds about right


[4/27/2024 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
The end of the session tomorrow might be the breaking of the siege of Fellburn, which in my head is highlighted by a couple of powerful npcs. Do you think say a 15th lvl cleric, a 13th level paladin, and two 11th level clerics is too much magical force for the Duke of Wisford to have brought together?


[4/27/2024 7:08 PM] rsulfuratus
IMO yes


[4/27/2024 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I haven't thought super carefully about it, but in general I've tended to not create NPCs who can cast higher than 5th level spells, unless they are supposed to be basically the most powerful people in a kingdom


[4/27/2024 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it breaks worldbuilding a bit if there are non-PCs who have that much magic. Or I guess rather non-adventurers, counting both PCs and villians


[4/27/2024 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
Isn‚Äôt it implausible that there are no super high level clerics in sembara at all though?


[4/27/2024 7:15 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn‚Äôt sure about the number ‚Äî ie would say 3 of the 8 most powerful clerics in sembara really be at this battle. But it seems like there should be say 8-10 clerics of 10+ level, right? I guess maybe half that makes more sense


[4/27/2024 7:15 PM] rsulfuratus
based on this with a population of 25 million (which might be high for Sembara - France in 1500 was more like 15 million), there would be perhaps as many as 13 clerics of level 9+

[4/27/2024 7:16 PM] .deciusmus
(Zs show is about to start so I‚Äôll probably stop responding in a min)


[4/27/2024 7:17 PM] rsulfuratus
a 15th level cleric would likely be the most powerful magic user in Sembara - so I guess the question is, would the most powerful magic user in Sembara be at the seige of Fellburn?


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point (in same spreadsheet) we had calculated about 12 milliion humans in Sembara. So that would imply something like 4 of the 6 most power magic users showing up at Fellburn


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
Right that‚Äôs too much


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
Probably should be 11th and 9th or something


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
More later


[4/27/2024 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
So I think I‚Äôd revise to have one 13th or so level powerful cleric and then a couple of 7th levels. Plus a 9th or 10th level paladin.


[4/27/2024 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
The 13th probably is one of the 3-4 most powerful casters in sembara (although the spreadsheet suggests about 15 level 9+ casters in sembara)


[4/27/2024 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems sensible


[4/27/2024 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
Actually maybe 11th. Just need them to be high enough level to cast forbiddance


[4/27/2024 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
sure
