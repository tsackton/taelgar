I was just browsing your addermarch session notes and I noticed..
"that it has apparently made its lair in a place with a strange -- and not functioning -- fey gate."

Do you have any thoughts on what makes fey gates start/stop functioning? Did I already ask you about this?

i am not sure there has to be a uniform answer. in this case, the set up was that there were two crystals (presumably originally from the feywild) that served as "anchors" on the material plane


[9/24/2024 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
one had be damaged, and so the gate couldn't function as it was no longer properly anchored

I've been playing around with the idea that I might have my PCs get some idea that they could destroy or otherwise disable the portal to duskmire near cleenseau


[9/24/2024 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
as a way to contain umbraeth somewhat


[9/24/2024 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I made a stub page for the Kilrath Stone Circle which would be a place where I'd put notes on this


[9/24/2024 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
this was a pretty minor gate in the scheme of things though


[9/24/2024 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
yeah the cleenseau feywild portal is a bigger deal, although it has already been established as a place that opens and closes for mysterious reasons


[9/24/2024 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
something like lastlight falls probably can't be so easily destroyed


[9/24/2024 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
the kind of basic idea I have about extraplanar connections is that they are of two kinds:
- "natural" connections which occur when the higher dimension space of the planes brings some other plane close to the material plane
- "anchored" connections which occur when someone drags a piece of another plane to the material plane


[9/24/2024 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
most things Dunmar has encountered are natural connections - extraplanar weak points, lastlight falls, Arborea ruins


[9/24/2024 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
these are probably not so easy to destroy as they require reordering extraplanar geometry


[9/24/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, if it is going to be a quest for 8th level characters, it shouldn't be that easy..

but an anchored connection (e.g., the elemental forge) is easier, you just break the anchor


[9/24/2024 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right yes, doesn't mean that are impossible to destroy


[9/24/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
in particular, it would be ideal if this portal could only be destroyed from the feywild side


[9/24/2024 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
just setting up the contrast with e.g. the fey gate in Addermarch which 2nd level charaters could mess with


[9/24/2024 8:52 PM] .deciusmus
which would then set up a whole sequence of... ok, now we need to get home somewhat


[9/24/2024 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, why not, if the goal is you have to reorder extraplanar geometry maybe the only way to do that is by destroying some feature in the feywild that corresponds to something particularly unique in the material plane at that location


[9/24/2024 8:53 PM] rsulfuratus
altering material plane doesn't work because the feywild just echoes and adapts. have to force the feywild itself "far away"


[9/24/2024 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
easy to come up with arbitrary logic like that for interplanar geometry, which should't really feel logical anyway
