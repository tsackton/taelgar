Mike:

Maybe this survives in a "humanity saved from the flood" holiday / miracle that is no longer really connected to Drankor, at least in Sembara.  
  
That is, it is no longer a "founding" miracle tale, but a "we didn't all die" miracle tale.   
  
But not sure, maybe it makes sense to just let it be the importance of miracles as the key remnant of this.  
  
It doesn't feel quite right that the Sembarans would be celebrating the Drankorian founding as a miracle, although that could maybe work for Chardon or a few other places.

Tim:
Right, I think the tension is with how strongly to tie Mos Numera and the Eight Divines to Drankor specifically.   
  
As far as I know there is no good real-world historical parallel for a religion that spread with a growing empire, but was not a particularly important political component of that empire.   
  
But I agree that having post-Empire states celebrate the founding of Drankor seems weird.  
  
On the other hand, religions need some kind of founding myth, usually, and especially a religion that takes as a central tenent the remembrance of miracles has got to have a record of those miracles.  
  
One idea is that the idea developed that local miracles, even if small, have way more significance than far away (in time or space) miracles, even if very large. So there isn't really a written religious history, because no one cares about the great miracle of 2000 years ago -- there are hundreds of more important local miracles to focus on. In a world where miracles are common enough that almost everyone would have personally witnesses at least one in their lifetimes, why focus on far away places? Or maybe this is specific to Sembaran Mos Numera (/'eastern')?

Mike:
In some of the mountain valleys in Zovcka, the 'small gods' of the Kestavo still linger, protecting one village or tribe.  
  
But save for a few,  these gods never attracted wide sets of worshipers, and so were never powerful

Tim:
I think this is very much spot on. I think some of these ideas would persist outside Greater Sembara, but the idea of personal gods and the layers of worship here are probably a pretty Sembaran expression of Mos Numera.

Mike:
Right. I like the idea that in this region (broadly, where Kestavo was replaced) has a different practice, in some ways, than other places. It adds nuance and also flexibility in the sense that something that happens in my game in Sembara doesn't have to be canonical in your Chardonian game :-)  
  
My current thinking is that this form of practice is used at a minimum in: Sembara, Tyrwingha, Vostok, Irebor (before the Great War), Tollen, and the highland kingdoms.  
  
It would not have been used in the far east, and Cymea is an open question.  
  
If Cymea has its own tradition, does that make the Vostok area more tied to Tollen, say? Or maybe because this is all the same religion, and the gods are real, and clearly respect all of these worshippers, there is not really any sectarian tension. The attitude could be: that's a little strange, but sure why, not?

Mike:
Artists and poets would fit here as well I think. Also maybe the insane?  
  
Would "touched by the Wyrdling" be a way of talking about the insane, especially those who are maybe not violently crazy?  
  
(Whereas the Jinnik, if it is known to the wider world, maybe is the patron of sociopaths and suicides and black depression)

Tim:
"The relationship between a person and the divine is personal and the divines want to hear from all, not just an elected few"
this may be more Sembaran than universal -- but as the worship of the Eight Divines was never really a state religion in either Drankor or Hkar, probably seeing religion as kind of 'for the common people' works okay

Mike
I liked this because at some level it is presumably true. Maybe a more organized form gives higher credence to the omens and only the priestly caste can interpret the foretelling of the gods.

Tim:
yeah, makes sense.

Mike:
What about the idea that one of the jobs of a temple steward is to recruit and 'maintain' a priest or even a priesthood within the temple. So the priest is never really appointed the steward, they are more like the talent and the temple steward the general manager of a baseball team.  <br>  <br>You could even imagine in some cultures (say Chardon) priests being a bit like celebrities, at least some of them, and the news that the Chardonian temple of the Mother has recruited such-and-such as the new head priest something some segment of the populace would get excited about.|

Mike:
Are you committed to the idea of "priest is the temple steward" rather than the possibility that the temple steward is responsible for the "care and feeding and recruitment" of the priest?  
  
I kinda feel like the second one fits into the theology a bit better, but if you feel strongly I have what I want in Sembara :-D and either works.

Tim:
not really. thinking about it, but now I see your comments down in the document and I think that idea could work well in the western branch - temple stewards as admin is very old, part of Drankorian tradition, but in the west it became crucial for survival to recruit actual divine magic users to communities, so temple stewards developed this extra role around securing protection aka a priest.

Mike:
Another idea could be that they are simply seen as the direct actors. There doesn't have to be a sense of intercession at all -- why not pray to the Mother directly, because you want her to tell you that your child will be born healthy? Arha/Malik could be loosely acknowledged as the primordial gods, but they wouldn't really be in the forefront of anyone's mind.  
  
Same in Sembara, actually, this could be a commonality -- the idea that the eight divines are the actors. It's just in Sembara, the idea of intercession stuck so people tend to ask the gods to intercede with each other. Whereas in the Kestavo practice, it was really seen as a true intercession with the overgods.

Mike:
Priests could have a whole complex organization beneath them that is supported financially by the temple stewards. You could imagine in Chardon the temple steward's responsibility is to keep the book of miracles, organize the feast days, keep up the temple, and maintain the priesthood. Whereas that last bit isn't part of their duties in Sembara.

Mike:
I like the idea that each god is distinct. To keep even small communities not optimizing their costs by having a single building though probably needs some kind of theological or cultural explanation.
