at least, without treking across addermarch or maseau or whatever
I don't really envision them trying to overthrow Umbraeth or whatever, and Ethlenn is explicitly anti-expansionist
I could see my players being interested in a high level quest to try to retake some of Duskmire or whatever but I think that would intriscincally have to be after Cloudspinner is restored, or they have no place for allies 
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 2:15 PM
so obviously umbreath - assuming the situation is basically unchanged in 1749 - is going to have thoughts and feelings about Cloudspinner's return
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 2:15 PM
yeah he's going to hate it
unless he can get her to agree in some way that everything that is his is his forever
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 2:15 PM
there are a few basic possibilities i'm toying with but i'm curious how important it is that he be tied up and not feature too much in the next dunmar arc
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 2:16 PM
I do not think he needs to be tied up
There is this weird unresolved question of whether the Cleenseau campaign cut him off from the material plane or not; if they fail I think he'd care less about the southern part of his realm
but honestly, it is probably better to run him as if they succeeded, and there is no fey portal in Cleenseau; easy enough for someone else to have succeeded between 1720 and 1749 if my PCs dont (and realsitically, it is pretty unusual for PCs to fail at major quests)
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 2:19 PM
i have another meeting but possibly more later
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 2:19 PM
yeah I need to go get lunch before my 3pm meeting

steel blue = shimmersong
dark blue = sharpspire
violet = twilight's grace
yellow/orange = amberglow
red = sunset gate

exact boundries of dotted line "sphere of influence" not precise
but basically:
sharpspire = highlands
amberglow = river valleys west of sunset gate
twilight's grace = orenlas + sembaran lowlands + river valleys east of sunset gate
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:23 PM
can you change sunset gate to run up the teft, btw. I do have an "along the sunset gate" adventure planned, which will probably be along the Mostreve Hills Tyrwingha/Addermarch boundary but if I decide I don't want it there the Teft is much better than the Volta for various reasons
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:24 PM
sure
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:25 PM
but the basic idea seems perfect
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:26 PM
Image
dotted line being "sunset gate runs somewhere roughly here tbd"
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:28 PM
Although I would prefer if we don't settle on a canonical northern edge of this - this map puts all of Sembara under Ethlenn's "sphere of influence" or sharpspire, and I'm not 100% convinced that is correct. But I think for your purposes the exact details of the northern boundaries here (i.e. is Ethlenn's sphere actually only as far north as the Semb, or the Sharpspire one only as far north as the Wistel) doesn't really matter
?
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:28 PM
right the dotted lines are not canonical and have room for whatever
i don't think the politics of the feywild north of the mostreve will come up in the cloudspinner arc
you have presumably not given any thought to what is south of twilight's grace
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:31 PM
none
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:31 PM
do you care?
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:31 PM
I don't really have any strong feelings honestly
Although the general vibe of Tyrwingha has been... "be careful in the hills, folks, if you go too far you might stray over the line and meet dark and dangerous fey"
but that could just be leakage on the Material Plane from the Darkwood or whatever.
The fey and material plane geography might not have an exact correspondence here
basically the yellow circle here:
Image
should be, in parts at least, on Taelgar at least, somewhat dangerous, enough that folks in Tyrwingha warn people about "going too far up in the hills"
but why that is does not matter in the slightlest to me
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:35 PM
but umbreath is trapped west of the sunset gate so this is not umbreath, correct?
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:35 PM
Although I might care about the details sometime this summer, so if you make something up, it can't stay secret forever
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:36 PM
well it isn't going to stay secret past March or April or whenever the cloudspinner arc finishes
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:37 PM
As far as Umbraeth:
I don't think there should be a DIRECT border where Duskmire and Twilight's Grace touch each other
I had this idea that Umbraeth can't cross the Sunset Gate but that doesn't have to be canonical
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:37 PM
i like the umbraeth can't cross the sunset gate a lot
i think addermarch works well as "contested territory" that is a buffer
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:37 PM
Yeah
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:38 PM
so the west part of your yellow circle is addermarch contested land, the east part is maybe something else, with the sunset gate running in the middle
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:38 PM
right
yes. although the ENTIRE yellow circle doesnt' have to be dangerous. The only canonical thing I'm working with here is a general vibe in the foothill/border towns in Tyrwingha that the hills aren't safe, and that in particular, the fey you might encounter in the hills might be dangerous in unexpected ways
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:39 PM
also i assume the sunset gate doesn't have to be fixed - i.e. there is no reason it couldn't have moved after cloudspinner's disappearance
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:39 PM
the plaguelands provides plenty of "non-fey" dangers
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:39 PM
right
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 6:39 PM
the only thing about the sunset gate is it is meant to be the actual line of sunset
I have no opinions about whether the actual line of sunset can move or not
secondarily, btw, there is no requirement that this "Dangerous fey area" has to have predated the Great War
i.e. it could have been that Ethlenn retreated due to some impact of the Plague/red mist
As an aside, looking at that map, I actually think it might work better if the Refuge of the Gossamer Veil was in the "Amberglow influence" area, not in Amberglow itself.
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 6:55 PM
Right. I think my idea is that all the feywild is divided into domains of influence, but “Amberglow proper” or whatever might be smaller than “amberglow extended”
But in some sense the distinction is a bit artificial
It just gives space for inventing a bunch of minor archfey and allows boundaries to be sharp in some places and gradual in others
Separately: my feeling is that some archfey (ethlenn, cloud spinner among those invented so far) are ancient (possibly predating the riving) and significantly more powerful than “typical archfey”
Others are various gradations of power. But probably there are not more than half a dozen of the “great fey” or whatever in the region from west coast through western green sea
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 7:39 PM
do you pay for chatgpt? i don't know if they have updated things recently but I've found the recent versions of the 4o model to be shockingly creative
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 7:39 PM
I do not
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 7:39 PM
kind of want to put this somewhere: 

Gloamscar – A land where daylight has been wounded, the sky torn open to reveal something older and darker than the Feywild itself, watched over by the fey warlock Severance, Keeper of the Rift.
(the names often need some pushing although that one is not bad)
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 7:40 PM
I have often wondered what this is:
Image
maybe that's where Gloamscar is
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 7:46 PM
once i decide what I'm using for this adventure i'm going to dump 100 raw ideas from chatgpt in brainstorming for fey realms.
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:07 PM
you said you had some umbraeth enemy stats?
*servant
duskhounds?
not that i would use them exactly but might be useful to see the vibes
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:08 PM
Yes I have a stated duskhound. I’m not at my computer but can send you in a bit
It’s aimed to be “boss-level” for 6th level party
I have a couple of other stat’d fey enemies as well if you want - other bosses mostly for my current “fey enemies” arc
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:10 PM
i'd take a look
the new monster manual is coming out tomorrow so i may also see if there is anything interesting in there
supposed to have more interesting high level monsters
there is rumored to be a statblock for a city-sized ooze, for example, just coincidentally
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:18 PM
not sure the best way to share bestiary. I have a bunch of stuff stat'd in obsidian in my DM folder..
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:18 PM
just put it in mechanics and push it
(in worldbuilding)
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:19 PM
I forgot we had a worldbuilding\mechanics
do you have the fantasy stat block plugin?
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:19 PM
yes
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:21 PM
pushed
in play my PCs fought 2 different duskhounds; one was a ordered to stay put and guard a retreat, so didn't use its mostly infinite misty step mobility. That was not super hard (esp as the whole party made the save against fright aura).

The other was jumping around with every attack and was much much more of a challenge.
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:43 PM
one more. my sense of umbraeth's vibe is all about rigged games, about cruelty, about the idea of the hunt. despite the way the duskhounds are statted it really isn't about like the fear of darkness or traditional ghost story kind of things
is that the vibe from your game?
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:44 PM
Yeah
The fey bosses are probably a bit more “themed”
But ultimately the duskhounds have a bit of an enforcer vibe
They are supposed to be a bit mindless
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:46 PM
right yeah, but the fear aura is more about they are scary (like how a dragon is scary) than about some innate connection to fear (like how drankor is terrifying)
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:46 PM
I mean not actually mindless. But they aren’t his lieutenants- they are more like his muscle
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:47 PM
i am making a minion version of duskhounds for you all
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:47 PM
Yes, the fear aura more about “they are scary”
I do see the duskhounds as a little bit like “mini Nazgûl” or something less like soldiers, ie I wouldn’t expect them in general to be quite as weak as minions, although I guess some minions can be relatively strong
Or ie I wouldn’t expect Umbraeth to have 100s of them around.
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:52 PM
ah okay, the vibe seemed a bit more like the foot soliders
maybe i'll make something else to be the foot soliders them
*then
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:52 PM
Ive been running them as more like lieutenants than foot soldiers
He has sent single ones of them to enforce stuff
