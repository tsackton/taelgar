A few rough notes I was thinking about while I was driving—  
  
- big schism out in the magic isles in the early days. At least two offshoots from this, the Skaer who have someone abandoned the rest of the pantheon for Kaikkea and the divine spark people. But I think these are not the only two offshoots and I think that at least some folks still followed the old mariner ways  
- the divine offshoot folks end up in Irrla. The exact details irrelevant as this only matters immediately for the impact on MTP  
- I was wondering if the people north of Ursk (who become the novja) were actually a small gods/kestavo/northern group. I kinda imagine Ursk as fairly irreligious with perhaps an underlying divine spark tradition and a bit of a sense that the overgod is important around death but otherwise the rodyne stand in for churches. But the novja might have a kestavo style religion that is surpressed. (Maybe not, just noodling)  
- the far East has a dualistic / Zoroastrian religion. Undefined whether this is a broad southern / eastern thing, an offshoot/variant on a broad thing, or something unique to Medju and the surrounding areas, ala Dunmari. Important only really for its influence on MTP  
  
MTP Religion— this is a mix of five major influences:  
  
- dualistic religion  
- ancient mariner gods, although much changed  
- Mos Numena  
- divine spark  
- random stuff  
  
The overriding attitude of MTP religion though is one that says: love your gods for if you do, they will watch over you. And there is also a strong sense of: the more love you give, the more love you have to give. This very strongly encourages adopting lots of additional gods. I am imaging the most religious folks having rosary bead style chains of symbols of many different gods and ships decorated with totems to many different gods, the more the better.  
  
The divine spark religion doesn’t actually contribute gods to this mix, but it does contribute a meditative tradition that the MTP people see as a way to get closer to the gods, and so there is a unusual semi-Buddhist style self-awareness / meditation philosophy that floats around. This leads to some folks say chanting a sutra to twelve different gods to strengthen their connection to them.  
  
[ metaphysical aside: perhaps this actually works, and that in part explains the diversity of gods in the region ]  
  
The only specific idea I had for an MTP god is a god of pleasure, hedonism, and sex. Seen as a bit shady in a way, but not totally underground. Potentially associated with some type of rich person tourism to MTP and an opium like drug. But not really sure about that at all

==================

So, here’s a random idea. 

  

Maybe the original Hkaran split between the mariners and the proto-Drankorians had something to do with arcane vs divine magic. 

  

The Drankorians end up extremely powerful wizards, but with kind of a ossified religion - Mos Numena hasn’t changed much for 2000 years, and with the temple administrator system doesn’t end up being a religion that is really highly invested in divine magic per se. 

  

The mariners, on the other hand, figure out some way to amplify the divine spark of humanity. This ultimately leads to the eastern Green Sea as kind of a birthplace for gods. 

  

The divine spark / direct worship of over gods grows out of this power; it also perhaps remains a factor in the MTP region, making it still something of a “birth place of the gods”. Maybe this plays out - in conjunction with the melting pot culture - with a bunch of demigods and minor deities elevated in power when the MTP culture gets a hold of them. 

  

Could also explain variable distribution of arcane vs divine casters across Taelgar, and perhaps even some lingering things like distain for arcane magic in Sembara (lingering influence of eastern/northern culture).
