(Jan 2021)

Sending you a bunch of stuff, probably in several emails. I have most of my new Taelgar stuff in a complicated and hard to share OneNote notebook.  
  
First, a few generic things; races, dates, languages, religion.

  

  

**Races**

I assume you would use my homebrew races? For those that people in various campaigns are playing, the D&D Beyond version should be the latest/most up to date in terms of mechanics. I'm not sure what the easiest way to share that homebrew with your campaign, although I guess I could just add myself to your D&D Beyond campaign if that happens. I also have GMBinder versions, which should be up to date in lore but may not have any mechanics tweaks I've made since various campaigns have started. They are linked from the Taelgar House Rules doc in the Dunmari campaign folder: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l2cPIqR7gkvSppYeM6ZBl7Mbf-Sd6qhRyW4HNuwnxfU/edit#heading=h.jorvf4fppkba](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l2cPIqR7gkvSppYeM6ZBl7Mbf-Sd6qhRyW4HNuwnxfU/edit#heading=h.jorvf4fppkba)  
  
**Dates**  
I have spent a while working on ideas about dating / reckoning of years in different cultures, as well as languages and names. For simplicity, many of the 'main' human cultures use Drankorian Reckoning, dating from the founding of Drankor (which also in some ways serves as the 'founding' of the main religion of Sembara, Chardon, Cymea, and perhaps some other places). By this dating, the death of Cha'mutte was 1545, the Dunmore stone titan one-shot was 1580, and the current year in our Dunmar campaign is 1748. So one timeline for your campaign could be that the defeat of the Dunmore stone titan set the mind flayers back a generation, and now 30-40 years later they are making another attempt, which would put you at 1620 or so DR, not quite 100 years after the end of the Great War. Canonically, Sembarans also use regnal year reckoning. The end of the Great War was also 26 Derik III, and the battle of Dunmore was 12 Wisym I. For non-humans, I have more details about dwarvish, elvish, and halfling reckoning, but not stoneborn or lizardfolk, and whether you even wanted to get into that is up to you.

  

**Languages**

For languages/naming, I've tried to adopt the Tolkien-esque strategy of pairing Taelgar languages with real world languages to give a kind of phonetic similarity to regions. I tend to use 'quasi-historical' names from [https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/) a lot, and also use Google Translate and browsing on Google Maps for place names. Generally speaking, Sembara/Cymea is ~English/French/Spanish (with Cymea more Spanish-ish), Chardon is ~Latin/Italian (but I also borrow some from Greek even though linguistically not similar because both Greek and Latin sound 'classical'), Dunmar is ~Hindi, Vostok/areas north of Sembara are ~Scandinavian/Germanic (with Skaer Islands especially Scandinavian). The old people who lived in Sembara before Drankor are ~Welsh/Celtic, so that carries through to some place names especially. Although probably not relevant for your campaign, the pre-Drankorian people west of the mountains use Semitc languages of various kinds.

  

For non-humans, I use Tolkien languages, Tolkien-esque sounds for Elves and Dwarves. For Stoneborn I've used Xhosan (loosely), and for Lizardfolk I've used Basque. Halflings tend not to use the Halfling language much with outsiders so haven't thought much about it; for halfling names have tended to adopt where they are from (so halflings from Green Sea area tend towards vaguely English/Tolkien-esque halfling names, but those from west of the mountains would probably be more Italian-ish).  
  
On the place names front, a few things still don't have good names, most notably the central mountain range. I've thought about a few possibilities: 1) it was called the central range or dividing range by Drankor, and now name has come down as a corrupted remnant of that; 2) something like broken or cursed or similar has arisen after great war reflected the devastation of ulrich and related areas 3) sharp, highrock, something implying tall, steep, and pointy. But so far have not come up with anything I like, and as far as I can remember they were never named in our high school campaign. The ocean west of Chardon is also unnamed but less likely to be relevant for your campaign.

  

You of course are free to use whatever naming scheme you'd like, as it is always possible that e.g. your campaign uses Common names for everything and my campaigns use the native tongues (the details in the player's guide are basically as far as I've gotten for the different human languages that exist).

  
**Religion**

For religion, the only two human pantheons I've fleshed out in any detail are the Eightfold Way of Sembara/Chardon/Cymea/etc, and the Dunmari Pantheon. Most of my notes on both of those are in the two player handouts for the Dunmar campaign. The only other notes I have are these:  
  
Eightfold Way based on Drankorian religion tradition. Most people have small shrines at home, larger communities have a shrine or temple. Worship focused on daily devotions at home and feast days/festivals. Also wandering priests/monks, who ask for alms. Major feast days about 1/month, with a few months with extra.  Descendants of Drankorian empire follow eightfold way, worshipping eight aspects of the Divine who each are balanced by both Araht and Malikor:  
The Mother (goddess of birth, fertility, spring, healing, wisdom, associated with the moon)  
The Father (god of light, order, justice, summer, associated with the sun)  
The Night Queen (goddess of darkness, death, sleep, winter, associated with the night)  
The Warlord (god of war, vengeance, smiths, autumn, associated with day)  
The Sibyl (goddess of magic, knowledge, love, beauty)  
The Wanderer (god of travel, trade, strangers, and outcasts)  
The Wyrdling (genderless diety of chaos, luck, fate, storms, and weather)  
The Wilding (genderless diety of nature and elements)  
  
Eight Virtures (maybe):  
Mother - faith  
Father - justice  
Night Queen - compassion  
Warlord - courage  
Sibyl - love  
Wanderer - charity  
Wyrdling - hope  
Wilding - prudence [??]

  

I have a few more details scattered in my notes for the family (Plaguelands) campaign and the Great Library campaign, which has involved interactions with the Night Queen a bit. But otherwise haven't fleshed this out nearly as much as the Dunmari pantheon, or non-human religions (which in general are detailed in the GM Binder docs).

  

My general feeling on religion is based on the idea that there is the central Divinity, the duality of Arhat / Melikor (who are variously brothers, the sky and the earth, sisters, husband and wife, often probably taking on the role of 'overgods' that are common in pre-Christian Mediterranean religions, but I haven't fleshed this out), and consciousnesses emerge out of that Divinity when people believe in them (human gods and other non-Elder race gods, to leave space for e.g. a hobgoblin or orc pantheon) or when the duality creates them (Firstborn, i.e. non-human gods). So 'old gods' fade and disappear, becoming weaker over time as belief in them fades, and new gods can be created by charismatic leaders. But in general gods try to use their power as much as possible to create miracles and inspire belief, which turns into a virtuous cycle sustaining both belief in and the power of existing pantheons (and hence new gods tend only to emerge out of catastrophe or chaos -- leaving open the possibility that some new gods emerged during the Great War and the end of the last age).

  

Will send Sembaran history in a bit.
