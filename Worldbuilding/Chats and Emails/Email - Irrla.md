(Oct 2022)

forwarding you my not-necessarily-entirely-need-to-remain canon notes to John about Irrla for the Wellby one shot. The hobgoblins, the recent history of the Republic of Svolhas, and the general vibe of "trying to build a navy fast" are definitely canon, but the climate and the economics are up for grabs.

Here is a bit of background for reference about the island your character is from for Thursday. Let me know what you think. Also, let me know if there are any magic items you'd particularly be interested in. I'm thinking of something like Mariner's Armor (gives you the ability to breath underwater and a swim speed); a magic spear of some kind; and some sort of utility item. 

  

1. Irrla (ear-la) is the name the humans of the Republic of Svolhas (ss-vol-las) give to the large island in the middle of the Green Sea, a massive inland ocean stretching more than 2000 miles from Sembara to the edge of the known world. A large, temperate island, it has cool, rainy summers with occasional weeks of hot dry weather, and cool, damp winters with little snow (think like a slightly warmer Ireland). The Republic is centered around the fertile land and good harbors of the southeastern coast of Irrla, which is vaguely "southern england" in climate and flavor.

  

2. The Republic of Svolhas is an "Athenian-style" democracy based around several important coastal cities, of which Rava is the largest and most important, with a substantial interior hinterland of mostly smallholds and rural villages that are generally ruled (often without direct representation) by a city to which they owe allegiance. Each city is ruled independently by the council of citizens, with a Senate consisting of representatives from each city that meets in Rava and controls foreign policy. Svolhas lives largely on trade: the Svolhas merchants often act as intermediaries between the desert cities (such as Medju) where exotic goods and spices are traded, and the Western Gulf (Sembara, Cymea, and Tollen). 

  

3, Svolhas is bordered to the north and northeast by the rough, rolling hills of the inland, filled with cascading, swift flowing rivers, and challenging terrain to cross, forming a natural barrier. The northeastern border, in particular, is heavily fortified by a line of castles (think the Welsh/English border), because to the northeast of Svolhas lies hobgoblin territory.  About 40 years ago, the Sharktooth Wars ended with the defeat of the previously dominant tribe, the Sharktooth clan, and the expulsion of hobgoblins from the fertile interior of the island, followed by a period of intense fortification to protect the northeastern borders. This has left the remaining hobgoblins -- currently dominated by the Skullcleaver tribe -- to turn to coastal raids and piracy.

  

4. The navy of the Republic of Svolhas has grown fast in the past generation, with lots of opportunities for advancement. While originally a largely galley-based fleet designed for coastal defense, in the past 10 years the Svolhasian Navy has made a name for itself on the eastern Green Sea, and there is much debate within Rava and other cities about finishing the job that was partially done 40 years ago, and driving the Skullcleaver clan and its remaining followers off the island for good. 

  

5. A few months ago, the citizens council of Rava voted to request that the Senate make diplomatic overtures to others on the Eastern Green Sea, to explore the possibility of a naval alliance, lead by the Svholhasian navy, to finish the hobgoblins once and for all. After much debate, this was approved. Several experienced naval commanders were sent with letters, a mix of diplomatic messages, trade documents to help finance naval expansion, and personal appeals/missives to diplomats across the Eastern Green Sea, traveling on fast ships.
