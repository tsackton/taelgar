(Jan 2021)

These are just rough notes, I'm going to try to put them into better form over the next few days but I'd be interested in your initial take. Three areas -- the southern marches, the political organization of Sembara, and how the empire of Sembara came together in the years before the Great War.

  

**Political Organization of Sembara**

I like the idea of a strong monarchy, but I think you had mentioned some thoughts towards a constitutional monarchy, and something more like the English throne than the French throne has more appeal to me and seems to 'fit' better.

  

The basic idea I had was that in Derik I or Derik II day the basic informal arrangements were codified in a document _The Charter for the Organization of the Royal Council and the King's Court_ which is usually just referred to as The Charter and forms the written rules of the kingdom. It outlines the line of succession, the makeup up the Royal Council, the powers, duties, and revenue due to the crown. 

  

I imagine the charter has been modified at times over the years, and by 1657, the council would consist of:

* The king/queen

* The dukes of the 6 great duchies (the five duchies of the heartland region, plus the duchy of Telham along the northland coast - note that Sembara is one of the duchies, and said duchy has always been held by the king -- so the king has an extra seat here)

* Some noble representative from the western marches

* Five royal ministers, appointed by the king: the chief minister, the minister of the treasurer, the minister of horse, minister of the navy, the minister of justice

* Two household ministers, appointed by the king: the chamberlain and the steward

* Some kind of royal / court wizard, although I haven't worked out details on how this person is appointed - but probably some kind of consensus position, not a direct appointee of the crown

* Some kind of representivity of the gods (or maybe two?)  
* the Prince of Twingha

* the keeper of the keys of Embry (a position elected by the guilds of the city) (plus maybe one or two other representatives from major cities)

* five elected commoners, the speaker of the farmers, the speaker of the fishers, and the speaker of the herders. historically these actually represented these specific occupations but today they are elected from specific geographic regions. plus in modern times, two more were added -- for the marches and twingha

  

This would be 6 nobles, 7 kings ministers, 3 positions personally appointed by the king, and 8 or 9 wild cards. Still playing with the balance. Plus, a halfling representative. I was thinking the halflings would have been bystanders in this agreement, but acknowledged as a key stakeholder in the kingdom, but without pledging loyalty to the crown, more like honored observers. 

  

The charter would outline basically the duties of the king (defend the realm, dispense fair and even handed justice, build roads and fortifications), some checks on the war making power, the royal sources of income (customs duties, taxes on salt, levies on inheritances, rents due from certain large estates, and the power to levy a land tax with consent of the council). Some stuff about the maintenance of knights, manpower due the king, maybe some regulations on magic, and something about due process of law and the rights of people to justice.

  

Still thinking about how the crown is responsible for justice and how that plays out (very feudal, i.e. the dukes and other lords dispense justice), or are there sherifs and other kinds of royal court systems? Not sure.

=====

Something like the English throne works fine for me. My sense is that the Sembaran monarchy is a fairly secular one, in the scheme of things (in contrast to some other places, such as pre-Great War Dunmar, where the ruler was literally chosen by real gods). Of course they acknowledge the gods, and magic plays a role, but more so than many other places, Sembara is a kingdom that trusts in the military might of its rulers and knights. E.g. if Sembara were a D&D class, would be a fighter, whereas Chardon would be a wizard, Tyrwingha would be a warlock, and Dunmar would be a paladin. This attitude would be strengthened by the events you made up with the history of the royal family, and the occasional curses/wild magic that comes from the Plaguelands, making people think magic is dangerous and risky, and the gods won't intervene to protect you (although of course sometimes they do - but Sembaran nobility is not particularly god blessed). So I think a relatively cursory role for court wizard and high priest on the council makes sense. 

  

I like Derik I codifying a charter, in part as a unifying step that binds the duchies of the heartlands, the southern marches, the northlands, Tyrwingha, and the highlands together. Perhaps towards the end of his reign. I think Vostok would have been conquered in Derik II's reign, and never a solid part of the kingdom. 

  

As far as the exact composition of the council, I'm pretty agnostic. I did make up a similar council scheme for Addermarch under Earl Eofric, consisting of the Earl, a 'court wizard' type referred to as the master/mistress of letters, a spymaster who was also associated with the Rangers, the Earl's chamberlain/personal secretary who also served as the master of arms, and a priest who also served as the master of law. Part of this was compression of roles for gaming purposes, since introducing more than a handful of NPCs in a council scene is confusing and hard to follow. But the basic idea of a royal council with some (but limited) real power, that includes some independent voices not controlled by the king, fits well with this design. And of course this is Addermarch, which is much smaller than Sembara writ large (and at this stage, a marcher duchy owing allegiance to the royal crown). My inclination would be that the exact composition of the council is not necessarily specified by the charter, and so changes over time. Perhaps charter specifies that the six great duchies, the gods, the Prince of Tyrwingha, the keeper of the keys of Embry, a voice of the magi, and a voice of the people are represented, but leaves the details a bit up in the air, and doesn't give a limit to the council size. 

  

As far as justice -- in Addermarch, justice is very feudal, dispensed by the lords of the manor in local villages, and ultimately Earl Eofric in his person. But it would certainly make sense that a more elaborate system of courts and sheriffs would have developed in the settled river valleys, even if feudal justice was still the norm in the marches in 1748. 

About halflings. I would not give halflings a seat on the council. Rather, I would make it so that one particular halfling family (which changes at a regular time interval, but always put forth by the halfling community and not the humans of Sembara) is given a title like Royal Observer, or something like that, and one member of that family is allowed to attend any meeting of the council, and speak for halfling concerns at the council, but does not have a vote. Something like that. Basically, someone the halflings can choose is always allowed to watch and listen and speak, but as the laws of Sembara do not bind halflings (at least those who have not sworn allegiance to the king), this individual is not allowed to vote at the council. I think there would also be long standing treaties / understandings, dating back to Drankor, regarding free movement of halflings, and perhaps more recent treaties on the rights of the little people in the Kingdom. Of all the Elder races, halflings would be most involved in human affairs -- lizard folk would not care, as they would tend to live in their own enclaves subject to their own laws (but this could be an interesting plot point, as some Sembaran cities and towns may have a nearby lizardfolk enclave where Sembaran laws have no force), and dwarves, although often settling in communities in human cities, tend strongly enough towards lawful that they would likely swear joint allegiance to the human lords of their community, excepting only the case where their preexisting duties to clan and caste conflict
