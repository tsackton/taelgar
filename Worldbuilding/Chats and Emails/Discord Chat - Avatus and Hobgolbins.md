one other thing about hobgoblins - while I think in context it makes sense that they would have put the people of Cleenseau to death given the strategic location as a beachhead, I think of hobgoblins more as authoritarian dictators and slavers than just mindless brutality, and also having enough strategic foresight to balance a reputation for brutality. for example perhap they slaughter anyone who resists, but towns that surrender are taxed, and perhaps some are enslaved, but allowed to escape with relatively little death. and also I guess for hobgoblins taxes and enslavement might not be far off - maybe it is something like they believe that humans naturally owe hobgoblins the products of their labor, so when they govern a place they order people what to do and take what they need of the product. and there is no freedom of movement, or anything. but this isn't chattel slavery, particularly. and of course they recognize that people need food to live and productivity is lower if the population is starving/cold, so living under hobgoblin rule is usually grueling and unpleasant, but not particularly deadly as long as you follow the rules and do what you're told


[11/4/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
Right. One of the reasons I sent it to you is I don’t have a good sense of hobgoblins other than hobgoblins = fascists and orcs = crazed warmongers


[11/4/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
any thoughts on hobgoblins vs halflings?


[11/4/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
Meaning would hobgoblinsnhave any different attitudes towards@other non human races


[11/4/2023 9:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i think that might depend a bit on the group


[11/4/2023 9:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't have a clear sense


[11/4/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the central idea for hobgoblins is they have like the opposite of the divine spark, they see human/incorporeal gods as weak crutches and humans as less-than-sentient for relying on them


[11/4/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
so there is a reason for a particular antipathy to humans


[11/4/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
but of course cha'mutte had a big influence on many hobgoblins and that would probably lead them to lumping nonhumans together


[11/4/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
with humans


[11/4/2023 9:59 AM] .deciusmus
Right. I might tweak the [[Avatus]] period history a bit. Actually [[Avatus]] was explicitly not allied with Cha’mutte, right?


[11/4/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
correct


[11/4/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe [[Avatus]] doesn’t sack the town at all and the halfling community especially has an uneasy truce with him.


[11/4/2023 10:01 AM] .deciusmus
That works to make the current Crossroads Inn a very old building that survived. Maybe it was a center of “Underground Railroad” type activities where the halflings were secretly helping humans escape


[11/4/2023 10:02 AM] .deciusmus
Which is useful for my game as it would explain why there are ancient underground tunnels


[11/4/2023 10:02 AM] rsulfuratus
that definitely would work


[11/4/2023 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus
in my notes Revaka - the hobgoblin in the mirror who was trapped by Cha'mutte for refusing to join his armies - was the granddaughter of the court magician for [[Avatus]]


[11/4/2023 10:03 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/4/2023 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus
so Cha'mutte wasn't super-active during Domain of [[Avatus]] anyway, or at least was not active enough that he was punishing hobgoblins who didn't join his side


[11/4/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/4/2023 10:05 AM] rsulfuratus
but it would be quite interesting to make the hobgoblin survivors of the domain of [[Avatus]] carry with them anti-cha'mutte attitudes (presumably hobgoblins were aware of him even that far back)


[11/4/2023 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
So basically you have:
- [[Avatus]], wants to conquer, enslaved the town


[11/4/2023 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
Next relevant set of hobgoblins is the 2nd hobgoblin war, which is the more “peaceful” shattered ice clan folks. They want land to live in more than anything


[11/4/2023 10:07 AM] .deciusmus
And so Cleenseau is fortified but never in real danger of distraction


[11/4/2023 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
But the 3rd hobgoblin war is caused by a new leader amongst the shattered ice hobgoblins who explicitly is seeking bad things for humans - more Naziesque as opposed to Mussolini, say


[11/4/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
And so when Cleenseau is sacked they put some larger percentage of the humans to death, but keep the buildings


[11/4/2023 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
in your hobgoblin war notes, you have the 3rd hobgoblin war started by sembara, but I actually think it makes more sense if it is started by a new hobgoblin leader


[11/4/2023 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus
DR 1644, summer: [[Charlotte II]] at the urging of her husband [[Lionel Falconhurst]], the grandson of the Duke of Maseau, and a prominent [[Isingue|Isinguen]], launches a rapid assault on the [[Shattered Ice Clan]], starting the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|Third Hobgoblin War]]


[11/4/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
Right. Maybe change that


[11/4/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
Or alternatively keep it half-way. The new hobgoblin leader is starting the war against maseau not sembara


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that could work too


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] .deciusmus
And sembara comes to their aid


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
either way I think a new hobgoblin leader with much more explicitly elliminationist aims is a useful component of the beginning of the 3rd war


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
which is also much more brutal on cleensau for that reason, which works for your history


[11/4/2023 10:12 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps something to do with the mad scientist hobgoblin politics as well— something that makes shattered ice less concerned with keeping Maseau as a buffer


[11/4/2023 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus
right this is all going to tie into the final tier 4 arc of the dunmari campaign somehow with beryl, the awakened monks, the isingue ooze, and the mad scientist hobgoblins


[11/4/2023 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus
so leave that blank for now, just "something changed"


[11/4/2023 10:13 AM] .deciusmus
And then when sembara comes into the war, and wins at first, the leader is enraged and decides to take on sembara as a first priority


[11/4/2023 10:14 AM] .deciusmus
So you have some degree of “self inflicted” but also some degree of “if not for sembara Maseau would probably be gone”


[11/4/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
right also sembaran army >> massau army, maybe the hope was sembara wouldn't risk another war and it was a bit of a surprise to the hobgoblins that they attacked, and they had to change their battle strategy quickly


[11/4/2023 10:15 AM] .deciusmus
Right. But the new somewhat crazy leader is a wizard or brilliant strategist or has access to a powerful artificat and so he wins and wins against sembara


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
i think for ~reasons~ sembara should never really know why he is winning so much


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
Actually magic could be key here— I have in my notes that the Tyrwinghan warlock army holds them back more successfully than the more mundane sembaran army


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
That works too


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
But I need some reason why Cece is so successful against him


[11/4/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, that could be vague as well I guess 😀


[11/4/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
let me look at the timeline a bit, i have a few ideas


[11/4/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
this is all in the 1640s right


[11/4/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
?


[11/4/2023 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/4/2023 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
If it works for you, how about: at some point in the war, Cece just starts winning battle after battle. The hobgoblins fight just as hard, and their tactics are sound, but they keep catching unlucky breaks, and stop catching lucky breaks. So for example maybe in the first battle a convenient lingering fog let’s the hobgoblins hide their calvary, but in the same circumstances later in the war the fog would blow away and clear two hours too early leaving them exposed


[11/4/2023 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
Just pushed a minor update to clarifiy the above, i.e. that the war started against Maseau in 1644 and then after some early Sembaran successes, the Shattered Ice Clan changed direction to fight against the Sembarans


[11/4/2023 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
The sembarans of course attribute this to divine favor, with maybe a little bit of “ethlenn is helping”


[11/4/2023 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
But really no one knows for sure


[11/4/2023 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
What I have established but what doesn't have to be canon is that the hobgoblins rapidly push north, and each summer another set of fortifications falls, in 1645, 1646, and 1647. Then in the winter 1647-1648 the old queen (Charlotte II) is killed in an ambush when visiting troops and Cece is crowned


[11/4/2023 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
I'm agnostic as to whether Cece has a few early stalemates, but the flavor I have written is that in the summer campaign seaso nof 1648 she just starts winning, and winning


[11/4/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
It works perfectly with the history for it to be seen in Sembara as just divine favor. I could even make Cece explicitly thought to the blessed by the Mother or something. She could plausibly have divine magic to some extent even


[11/4/2023 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
I would say she has a few statements in spring that are basically forgotten about now, and then in the summer begins a winning streak driven by exceptional bad luck on the part of the hobgoblin armies, and assumed in sembara to be cece’s divine blessing


[11/4/2023 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
Works perfectly


[11/4/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
The other bit I have is that the Tyrwinghan army, in alliance with the Earl of Addermarch, is much more successful at holding the line against the hobgoblins than Sembara. This could very plauisbily just be because the hobgoblin leader sees it as their mission to kill the sembarans specifically to punish them in meddling with his war against Maseau


[11/4/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
But there could also be a fey/warlock side


[11/4/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
I can leave it undefined


[11/4/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I think that’s fine, combination of factors can make that work.


[11/4/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
Here's what I'm adding:

Enst Campaign
---
DR: 1648
tags: [event-source]
---
A series of battles between [[Sembara]] and the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] that pushed the hobgoblins south of the [[Enst]]. Characterized by exceptionally bad luck on the part of the hobgoblins, which is attributed in Sembara to Cece's personal connection to the [[The Father]]


[11/4/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
DR 1648, late winter: Charlotte II is [[The Ambush of Charlotte II|killed by hobgoblins]] while travelling to inspect the [[Army of the South]] camped outside [[Wisford]]
* DR 1648, late winter: Cece I crowned Queen
* DR 1648, early spring: The [[Army of the North]] attempts to break the [[Siege of Dunfry (Third Hobgoblin War)|siege of Dunfry]], and is bogged down
* DR 1648, late spring: Cece I combines the Armies of the South, and Mostreve, and raises a special levy across the realm, and forms the [[Radiant Alliance]], which she takes personal command of
* DR 1648, early summer: After a few stalemates, the [[Radiant Alliance]] breaks the siege of  Dunfry and the Armies of the North and West join with the Radiant Alliance
* DR 1648, summer:  [[The Enst Campaign]] pushes the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] west of [[Barony of Vaubonne|Vaubonne]] and south of the [[Enst]]


[11/4/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that is great


[11/4/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
Even the name works for Semabara to treat this as divine favor


[11/4/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
(Radiant Alliance)


[11/4/2023 10:39 AM] .deciusmus
yeah. all that is pushed


[11/4/2023 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I also pushed some notes copied from various word docs I have in onedrive from the high school game under Worldbuilding\High School Notes

[11/4/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
Would it be implausible for Avatus to have constructed a permanent dimension door that would teleport people from the old Drankorian fort on the south bank of the Enst to a small underground fortification on the north bank?


[11/4/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
That could still exist, perhaps?


[11/4/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
That seems totally plausible. His court wizard made the mirror of soul trapping after all


[11/4/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
True


[11/4/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
Mostly just looking for ways to expand the dungeon 😄


[11/4/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
But I'm thinking that's how he broke the Sembaran line. Although Sembara was a bit disorganized at the time, holding the line of the Enst would have been important, and crossing the fortified bridge relatively hard. Avatus sent a crack team of hobgoblin adventures across the river under the cover of invisibility/etc and then constructed -- a little bit away from the main town -- a small underground area, with a dimension door back to the south bank where Avatus had taken over the old drankroian fort. From the underground base, the hobgoblins constructed various ways to attack behind the lines, thus defeating the army in a surprise midnight attack


[11/4/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
which today, plays out as some mostly ruined tunnel from under the town leading to a large underground staging area with a portal back to the lair of Avatus, which is mostly ruined, but might still have a few weird things hanging around

FYI, whe you are making background stuff add "Notes" to the name, i.e .Great War Notes instead of Great War

[11/4/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
Otherwise all the links to the actual Great War event change to Events/1500s/Great War which looks ugly
