Let me know what you think, I can try to write it into the main religion doc if you like the general thrust.

The eastern religion has its roots in the ancient intercessory belief from the mariner culture of Hkar. The tradition involved the idea that prayers to the Divine are given to one of the great beings: the earth, the sky, or the sea. And then these beings bring them to the Divine. Except when the wind (a fourth entity) steals them away (although the mischievous wind of course does not always steal blessings, sometimes they carry the blessing you didn't dare ask, or steal your enemy's blessing).

Over time, this results in a religion with four great gods: the Sky, the Earth, the Ocean, and the Wind, loosely personified, but seen more as the conduits to the Divine. Over time, helpers of these great gods are mixed into: the spirits of islands (the children of earth and ocean), and the cloud spirits (the children of ocean and sky). The spirits provide guidance and advice and support to humans, but ultimately, there remains a strong sense that the Divine (Ahra/Malik) is the 'real' god.

Not sure how this plays out in the farther east, but this develops into two traditions in the Greater Sembaran region: the Kestavo, and the Skaer religion


The Kestavo tradition is born of two main things:

* The easterns moving inland, and losing the daily connection to the sea

* Encounters and intermixing with the spiritual traditions of the northerns

  

This results in a religion that loses the specific spirits (the clouds and islands) of the eastern religion, but keeps a few major 'primordial' gods around the Earth, the Sky, and probably the mountains. And gains a massive influx in the idea of lots of small gods and small spirits, from the northerners.

  

The Skaer tradition on the other hand doubles down on the ocean. The idea develops that the only important god is the ocean itself, and all intercession with Arha and Malik goes through the ocean. The ocean stays only loosely personified, and a culture develops that Arha and Malik enable the great ocean to perform miracles <some ideas about whales, waves, and specific ocean spirits and how they might play out>. But ultimately Skaer is a religion where all worship is really around the personified ocean, who is the great artibitor and intercessor with Arha and Malik.
