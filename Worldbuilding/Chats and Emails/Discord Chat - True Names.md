any thoughts about true names and the magic of names esp amongst the fey in taelgar?

Not really a thing? Myth/culture but not very powerful? Some type of actual magic?

i added images for the rest of Delwath's items, curious what you think/if there are any that don't work for you

also not sure how I missed the question about true names / magic of names. don't really have thoughts other than kind of wanting to avoid layering too many things together. might make sense for dragons and/or fey? certainly seems kind of fey-ish to have names mean something...but no real strong feelings any way at the moment

I like the Delwath items. The rod of the pact keeper is creepy but that seems reasonable given its origin

On names, here is what I ended up telling my players...

That said, to expand on the "aliases and names thing"....

The actual biggest danger is not even the "alias/call me by" that Kiya is talking about, it is the innocent  but misleading question, i.e.

"Can I have your name?"

A trickster fey could certainly have magic about them that would mean answering that question with "Sure, my name is Robin" could be bad. Now the fey "has" your name - maybe that makes it easy for them to impersonate you - maybe it means all of a sudden you forget your name - etc.

But the trouble was not catching the precise wording.

Answering a question with "Call me by..." rather than "my name is" is a safety measure - if someone says

"Can I have your name" and you answer "Call me Robin" you haven't given away your name.
Secondarily, the point Kiya was making is also true. There is a degree to which certain curses, rituals, etc depend on knowledge about the person, and certainty is better than doubt.

So announcing to a fey "I am Robin of Abenfyrd, born in 1699, member of the order of the chartiable wanderer, acting guard captain of Cleenseau" gives them more true things about you. Which can make certain types of magic easier.

Saying instead: "Call me Robin, lately from Abenfyrd, wanderer and defender of the lands north of the Enst" is a lot vaguer, and thus less powerful.

But also a lot of Sembarans would call some of this Tyrwinghan superstitution. The true nature of fey magic is mysterious and exactly what powers it none of you know

To add, as far as you know there is no "true name" magic. That is, it isn't like if someone knows your name is Robin or Celyn or whatever, they have a voodoo-doll power over you and somehow you have to hide your name. 

It is better to think of it as more along the lines of - the less well your fey adversary knows you, and the more obstacles or secondary interpretations you put in your words, the better.

[ in my head, I was basically thinking I didn't want to introduce yet another type of magic, although if dragons or something ends up having the concept, fine, there is a lot of "as far as you knows" in the above. But I think fey have enough going on without introducing the idea of True Names or whatever. And that the vibe of "hiding who you are" is better than something about the specific name ]

yeah this all makes sense to me from a fey angle. possibly dragons have some secret "magic language" where names matter more or something (a callback to 'true magic' from high school) but that is for later and I agree the fey vibe is more about knowledge of who you are then any specific words
