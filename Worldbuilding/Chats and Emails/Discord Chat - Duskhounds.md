Nathaniel just texted me to ask who umbraeth is


[9/20/2024 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah we just finished a session and they met a naiad who mentioned umbreath


[9/20/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
he is really leaning into the secret fey connectin of the de brune family


[9/20/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
I told him Umbraeth was better known as the Gloomshaper and is dangerous and too stay away.  And it wasn't safe to talk. And to ask the Squire of the Whispering Wind about Umbraeth


[9/20/2024 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus

[9/20/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus

[9/20/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
what did the naiad tell them about umbraeth


[9/20/2024 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
just that his duskhounds sometimes ride through the darkwood, and to be careful


[9/20/2024 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus

But you gotta be 6-7th level to take them on, probably


[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus

[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
