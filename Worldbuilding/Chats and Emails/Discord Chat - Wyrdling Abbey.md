Solas Abbey

The building is reminiscent of some Tuscan abbeys, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Sant%27Antimo. Sits above the river on a downslope of a hill, near a minor tributary. 

While no longer occupied by a religious order, the structure itself is relatively intact, although most of the outbuildings are gone. The original chapel of the Wyrdling remains well-kept, and the current occupant has established quarters in the old chapter room. 

A large statue of the Wyrdling in human form, depicted as a two-faced jester, one male, one female, and both with inscrutable expressions dominates the inside of the chapel. The walls are plain stone, but there are three large stained glass windows which depict: a large thunderstorm that looks like it is being held back by a rainbow; a group of children being fed by apples plucked from the sky by a creature that looks like a satyr; a person being hugged by what look like arms of wind, and an evil spirit flying out of them. 

There is a strange feeling about the place, not exactly a sense of peace but a sense of belonging. Whatever doubts you might feel about yourself, your place in the world, you feel like someone hears them and cares. 

The abbey is currently occupied by a lone hermit/priest, who goes by Mel. 

This is a safe place to rest - shadow hunters cannot get here.
