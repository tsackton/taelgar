[2023-01-04 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: Also one of my players is asking about the difference between the Wildling and the Wrydling, I pushed a few changes... basically making the wildling about nature and the wrydling about chaos of humanity/human spirit/inward-mental type things (as well as giving the wrydling care over transgender people, which seems to fit, and my group is very queer so I'm trying to make an effort to highlight queer-forward stuff)
[2023-01-04 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that is consistent with my docs, I think? the wyrdling is kind of a combination of the Bastard from the Curse of Chalion books and the Norns/Fates type gods from Greek/Norse myths
[2023-01-04 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: the wildling is really kind of the generic nature diety
[2023-01-04 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus: I had a whole abbey of the wyrdling in the Chasa river valley you never went to that fleshed this out a bit.
[2023-01-04 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus: Solas Abbey
    
    The building is reminiscent of some Tuscan abbeys, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Sant%27Antimo. Sits above the river on a downslope of a hill, near a minor tributary. 
    
    While no longer occupied by a religious order, the structure itself is relatively intact, although most of the outbuildings are gone. The original chapel of the Wyrdling remains well-kept, and the current occupant has established quarters in the old chapter room. 
    
    A large statue of the Wyrdling in human form, depicted as a two-faced jester, one male, one female, and both with inscrutable expressions dominates the inside of the chapel. The walls are plain stone, but there are three large stained glass windows which depict: a large thunderstorm that looks like it is being held back by a rainbow; a group of children being fed by apples plucked from the sky by a creature that looks like a satyr; a person being hugged by what look like arms of wind, and an evil spirit flying out of them. 
    
    There is a strange feeling about the place, not exactly a sense of peace but a sense of belonging. Whatever doubts you might feel about yourself, your place in the world, you feel like someone hears them and cares. 
    
    The abbey is currently occupied by a lone hermit/priest, who goes by Mel. 
    
    This is a safe place to rest - shadow hunters cannot get here.
[2023-01-04 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus: Mel
    Nonbinary Chardonian, priest of the Wyrdling, lives in Solas Abbey
    
    Description: An middle aged person, maybe in their late 40s or early 50s, but has a kind of ageless look. Smooth, rounded face, short cropped hair, ambiguously gendered features.
    
    Mannerisms: Slow and deliberate in everything. Likes to listen before speaking.
    
    Game purpose: Provide a safe place to rest and recover. Possible info-dump, healing resources.
[2023-01-04 10:36 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that all fits with my (minor) changes
[2023-01-04 10:36 PM] Deciusmus: It is quite consistent with what I was thinking, but some of the overview material I think didn't highlight as much
