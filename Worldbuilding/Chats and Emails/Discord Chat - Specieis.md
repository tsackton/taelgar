thinking a bit about biology/fertility/lifespan of other species as part of a bit of cleanup of the species directory.


[10/30/2023 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
general idea is: elder races (need new name) are all long-lived but generally not super high fertility, each for somewhat unique reasons. humans, goblinoids, are basically typical Earth human. fey have their own strange relationship with time. other species are basically assumed to be human-like unless there is an obvious lore reason to change them.


[10/30/2023 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
elves: non-overlapping generations, ka, as we've discussed extensively


[10/30/2023 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
stoneborn: kind of think they should actually be born from stone, and gradually turn back to stone.


[10/30/2023 2:20 PM] rsulfuratus
lizardfolk: generally think of lizardfolk as having a very extended old age. mature at same rate as humans, fertility ends at same rate as humans, but they remain active and healthy into their 200s relatively frequently, so just have a really long elder period. makes their culture a very elder-focused. most kids would know not only their grandparents, but their great- and great-great-grandparents, at least


[10/30/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
dwarves: generally think of dwarves as just having really low fertility, kind of a very extended middle age and a relatively short old age. come of age only a little slower than humans (late 20s/early 30s, when they do the heart of the mountain ceremony), but remain capable of bearing children until 150-200, and then often live another 50 years after that


[10/30/2023 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
halflings are most human-like, basically Tolkein-esque, just often living a bit longer than humans


[10/30/2023 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda think lizardfolk need something a little more interesting


[10/30/2023 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah they are the least appealing but not sure what


[10/30/2023 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
I agree on dwarves, halflings, stoneborn


[10/30/2023 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
general idea is elves and stoneborn are the most alien, dwarves and halflings are the most human


[10/30/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
Dwarves probably need something more interesting too, but it is probably private and secret and not *that* different from humans


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the point about dwarves from a worldbuilding perspective is just that they would kind of feel like stretched out humans - you'd have a lot of dwarven familes with 2-3 kids, they would just often be a decade apart


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
they already have the coming of age ceremony, the thuhr, all that, I don't think they need too much weird biology on top of that


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
That's kinda what I meant by not that different.


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
right, makes sense


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn't thinking weird biology so much as somewhat non-human marriage and family-rearing customs


[10/30/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like in-game dwarves outside of their homeland are almost always unpaired


[10/30/2023 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense, also can be left to a player who really cares to develop


[10/30/2023 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is true. hadn't noticed that, actually.


[10/30/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
I do have a minor NPC in my game who is a nonbinary dwarve married to a woman. But he is explicitly very undwarven


[10/30/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
*they


[10/30/2023 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
the dwarves in Tokra being a notable exception


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess there was a whole family there


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, it doesn't matter much. I just expect there is something a little more interesting going on in the dwarven marriage and pair-bonding culture than "copied from humans"


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, sure


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
But it wouldn't be a world-building thing


[10/30/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Lizardfolk on the other hand.... a few ideas...

hatch from eggs? Maybe culturally there are large rare clutches from just one woman? so lots of siblings, no sense of nuclear families, pairbonding unrelated to child-rearing

a spawn stage after birth, like where they are more fish like and independent?

rapid maturity?


[10/30/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure I like any of those, just brainstorming


[10/30/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
Could be lots of clutches of eggs, with lots of lizard folk "young" not surviving (but I don't really love that, would imply lots of predators eating the young or something)


[10/30/2023 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Communal tending of eggs? Temarie like-learning through the shell? Maybe lizardfolk spend a long time in eggs (several years) and the elders tend to the eggs and lizardfolk hatch knowing how to talk and such


[10/30/2023 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe very conscious control over fertility, so the community plans how many kids to have each year (how many eggs to lay?) and it is all very elder directed and egg laying is not really connected to pair bonding or "family" per se


[10/30/2023 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I think “hatch from eggs” and “primarily aquatic during first few years” are in my notes somewhere


[10/30/2023 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
Could also make them like some fish, maybe they reproduce parthenogenically and have the capability to metamorphose to change sex if desired


[10/30/2023 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
probably want to run some ideas by Eric before making anything canon


[10/30/2023 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
His Mawar lizardfolk character at least had some sense of a “family back home”


[10/30/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Not sure if anyone else has ever played a lizardfolk in a real game


[10/30/2023 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Also in the Kenzo one shot Eric played a lizardfolk who had found a baby lizardfolk abandoned and decided to care for it (it turned out to be something else but the idea of a non-aquatic baby needing care has to at least make sense)


[10/30/2023 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Even if the “find one abandoned” is quite unusual


[10/30/2023 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
another idea. what if the thing about lizardfolk is that they are actually reincarnated. so in order to have a kid you need to convince an ancestor's soul to come back. would give them complete control over fertility since if you don't want a kid you just don't ask.


[10/30/2023 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
from a worldbuilding perspective I think the key idea is that creating a long-lived race that is much less numerous than humans requires some fiddling with fertility and growth rates.


[10/30/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
I like that last one


[10/30/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Although "family back home" doesn't necessarily mean "traditional nuclear family"


[10/30/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
Probably the key thing here, which doesn't need a full answer now, is that lizardfolk have specific conscious control over fertility. So population growth is very managed and they tend to maintain stable populations around the carrying capacity limit of their choosen environments


[10/30/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Which actually makes a ton of worldbuilding sense -- there are no lizardfolk striking out to find new land, for the most part. There could be lizardfolk cultures / communities that are actively expanding, and others than are not, but it would all be very self-conscious and community directed (so not even "each lizardfolk couple" chooses whether to have a kid) but more "each communitiy allocates kids in some fashion"


[10/30/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that works well



[10/31/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I've used them a bunch as kind of 'not-quite-enemies' in Isaac's campaign, but you all never bit on the investigating kobold raiders in the myrenai gap side quest in the Dunmar campaign


[10/31/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
Which isn't to say they shouldn't exist or anything but I've been cautious about having too much going on at once


[10/31/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
in my game, I mean


[10/31/2023 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
in my typology the only creations of the Void Mind / Three Despairs are orcs and goblinoids, plus undead (Ghesyn, the Soul Eater) and lycanthropes (Jinnik)


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so anything else wouldn't be a strictly evil race IMO


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
right, makes sense


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
I think if there were background lying around in Obsidian on kobolds I might use them somewhere, I just don't have any thoughts on them, per se


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
kobolds in my mind were created by dragons in the early days of the world and basically got left behind when the elder wyrms diminished in power during the Long Pause


[10/31/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case if you haven't used them for anything I can add some notes based on how I've introduced them in Isaac's game and my general thoughts


[10/31/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
will probably be pretty thin to start
