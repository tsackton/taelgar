btw, here is the history of a ruined villa in western Cymea that is the setting for my game tonight
The Perdoli Manor (*Pehr-DOH-lee*) was build in 1479, by the wealthy Perdoli family, merchants and traders. Got rich off wine and control over a marble quarry in the hills, built manor as a place to relax and get away, about a day's journey into the hills from Vistalba. 

The family enjoyed the manor for several generations, until the Great War. The Perdoli family faired poorly, and came out of the Great War having lost much of their wealth (details don't really matter). A few years after the Great War, forced to sell the villa. The new owners were not much better, and never lived there, and couldn't afford the upkeep. Some stone was scavenged during this time, but it was too far away to be convenient. The new owners died without heirs, living the manor to fall into disrepair and ruin in the 1590s. 

It stood empty save from occasional wandering travelers seeking shelter far from home for the next 30 years or so, generally falling out of memory of the local villagers, who had other problems to deal with. 

In the 1620s, the manor was reoccupied by a medusa, who made it her lair for 30 years, during which time it acquired a reputation as a cursed place, and fell further into disrepair. The medusa eventually succumbed to her reflection, caught unexpectedly by the water in a fountain. While she lived there, some crude repairs were made to the manor, scavenging stone from outbuildings as needed. 

In the 1690s, a group of pirates and bandits fleeing the beginnings of Tollender persecution moved in and made it a hideaway for the next 15 years or so. They dug tunnels and built a secret room behind the wine cellar to store treasure, and repaired the smithy/forge and parts of the manor, in a crude fashion. The leader was killed by the Tollender Navy in the 1720s, and the lair was gradually abandoned. 

It has sat empty since then, until recent events.
