(Jul 2023)

Here's a revamped Green Sea trade route view, riffing on both my reading about earthly trade routes and our earlier text thread, and the in-game facts established by Wellby's one-shot.

  

(I'm doing this mostly just because world-building is fun, so, obviously, tweak/rewrite as you see fit. My main in-game interest is also to establish Sembaran/Tyrwinghan/Tollen impacts, especially as I expect my game will go to both Tyrwingha and Tollen at some point -- but I find it easier to think about that by making up at least some facts about what is farther out).

  

The basic structure of the Green Sea is (I think I have this right) is basically three regions:

  

* The Western Gulf - enclosed, safe sailing, rarely out of sight of shore. ~400 miles end to end. Analogous to the Adriatic or Red Sea or Baltic Sea. Bordered by Tollen, Tyrwingha, Sembara.

  

* The Western Green Sea - approximately the area between the Cymea/Vostok and Irrla. ~1300 miles end to end, analogous to the eastern Med, the South China Sea, or the Arabian Sea. Tollen to Irrla is about the same as Rome - Jerusalem, Ethiopia to India, or Hong Kong to Java. Bordered by Skagenland, Cymea, South Cymea, Vostok, western Irrla, and some parts of <Eastern Dunmari>. Still relatively sheltered and navigable, but Irrla itself is dangerous in parts and crossing from the south to the north can be tricky.

  

* The Eastern Green Sea - from Irrla to the eastern islands, ~2000 miles - about the distance from Denmark to Greenland, or Ireland to Newfoundland, or eastern India to Java. This has significant open water sailing and requires skilled seamanship to cross north to south. Heavily monsoon wind-dependent. Bordered by eastern Irrla, <Eastern Dunmari>, Medju and perhaps some similar desert cities, Ursk, <Magic Islands>, <Far North Peninsula>

  

One aside: how much do you think human and halfling merchants compete vs cooperate? Are Tollenders and halflings constantly trying to undercut and outsell each other, or is it more of a divided terrority type thing with specialization (halflings river boats, Tollender ocean vessels in Sembara, say)? Or maybe some of both?

  

**Western Gulf**

The Western Gulf is dominated by Tollender ships plying back and forth save for the stormiest winter months. Trade is mostly grain and wool from Sembara, wine, tin and copper from Tyrwingha, in exchange for finished products -- dyed clothes and other fine cloth, mostly. Tollen also acquires some metals (iron and steel) from various dwarven settlements in the mountains, mostly via Sembara, but perhaps some via Ardlas or Breva instead. Tollen has a substantial furrier industry as well, but Sembara also acquires furs from its own highlands and the northern highland kingdoms, so there is less demand (although not none) for Tollender furs in Sembara. Halflings are certainly important on the great rivers of Sembara, but I'm not sure how much they also compete with Tollender ocean going vessels, or do the halfling cargo ships mostly sail much further routes out across the Green Sea?

  

Both Tollen and Sembara have substantial gold (Tollen and Sembara) and silver (Sembara) resources, so there is also a fair amount of trade in bullion - Sembaran silver flowing into Tollen in exchange for fine goods, and Tollen gold flowing into Sembara in exchange for grain. The balance of payments is actually probably about equal.

  

**Western Green Sea**

Tollen vessels sail out through the Straights of Cymea and trade along both the Cymean and Vostok coasts. Cymean wine, jewelry, and cotton is popular, and Cymea welcomes Tollender furs and clothes -- but Cymean itself has few large merchant houses and few ocean-going vessels. Trade from Cymean to Isingue and west to Chardon has obviously vanished since the Great War, and Cymea has not developed a mariner culture to challenge the halflings or Tollender dominance of the waves. From Vostok, Tollender traders buy many products of the north, including furs, wax, honey as well as iron, tin, and copper. 

  

On the north coast, Tollender merchant fleets go as far east as Ursk, to buy dragonhide and rare materials used to make the famous Tollen red and green dyes. These fleets usually sail in convoy from Tollen on some schedule that makes sense with the winds, perhaps even overwintering in Ursk or otherwise spending a long time there. Might even typically only sail every other year. 

  

The Tollender fleets do not go east of Cymea in the south, perhaps something about the passage between Irrla and the Cymean islands is tricky and only halflings know the way, or something else. 

  

Halflings also ply these waters, trading frequently between Irrla, Cymea, Tollen, as well as Telham in Sembara. 

  

**Eastern Green Sea**

Tollenders and Sembarans know little of the Eastern Green Sea. Halfling traders bring exotic goods - spices, perfumes, rare monster parts, unusual or magical gems and herbs and incenses, technological wonders from the desert gnomes, etc to Tollen, Cymean, and less often, Telham and Tyrwingha but outside some garbled rumors of the great spice city of Medju and the <Eastern Dunmari Pensinsula> little is known of where these goods come from. These eastern exotics are purchased with Tollen fine clothes, Tyrwinghan glassware, Sembaran furniture and gold and silver, dragonhide and monster parts and arctic wonders from Ursk, ?? from Irrla, ?? from the magic islands, and Cymean wine.  

  

Of course some of those ?? from Irrla and the magic islands also makes it west, but broadly the populace mostly sees them all as coming from  Medju and the <Eastern Dunmari Pensinsula>.

  

One open question is how many people live out east. Is it enough to sustain these major trading routes, or would they mostly dry up if Sembara, Cymea, and Tollen stopped buying? What about Chardon? Maybe the halflings or Medju princes have some secret path to getting these wonders of the east to Chardon (teleportation circles?) Or maybe Medju is actually a shadow of its former glories (say, in the Drankorian days when Drankor would have been a major buyer) and has a sense of lost greatness about it.

  

One idea for the reality is that actually the <Eastern Dunmari Penisula> is itself a third major maritime power on the sea, and perhaps, like the Indonesians and Malay in the real world, they are the sailors and mariners staffing trading ships controlled by Medju spice lords, which compete with the halflings to bring goods as far west as Cymea, where Tollender traders buy them and bring them east. 

  

**Summary**

So this picture, which definitely is just a starting point and could use some more fleshing out, ends up with a bit of everything:

  

* Several long-distance multi-stage trade routes in exotics: 

** one from places unknown to Medju then onward to Cymea via <EDP> sailors, and then onward to Sembara/Tollen via Tollenders

** one from Ursk/MagicIslands/EasternGreenSea places to <EDP> to Cymea, via <EDP> sailors and halflings

** another directly from EasternGreenSea to Tollen/Sembara via halflings

** another from various Eastern Green Sea places to <EDP> via halflings and then from <EDP> onward to the west via halflings as well (some halflings might sail the full circuit, others might mostly go back and forth from <EDP> to Cymea to Tollen/Sembara and reverse, and others might specialize in the eastern green sea, plying the waves from EDP to Irrla to Ursk to Magic Islands to Medju and back to EDP)

  

* A Tollender specific long distance trade route to Ursk for rare dyes and dragonhide, to fuel their dye/clothing industry

  

* Substantial "local" trade amongst Sembara/Tyrwingha/Cymea/Skaeganland/Vostok all mediated by mostly Tollender sailors but with halflings important here as well

Agreed, this is all fun -- when I'm working by myself I tend to focus more narrowly on game-relevant things but for broader world construction collaboration I enjoy the wider stuff. 

  

Note also I have some tentative notes on currents and wind here: [https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/blob/main/Worldbuilding/Green%20Sea%20Notes.md](https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/blob/main/Worldbuilding/Green%20Sea%20Notes.md)

Yes, I think this is basically right. Thinking culturally/linguistically/religiously, you can also draw a pretty clean line with Cymea, Vostok, South Cymea, and Skaegenland all being more or less influenced by the Drankorian Empire, all speaking Common (Westros) as their primary trade tongue, and all (mostly) having Mos Numena religious influences (with the exception of Kestavo remnants and the Skaer retaining much of the old Hkaran mariner religion despite adapting Drankorian-related language and trade tongues).

Or maybe some of both?

  

I haven't given this much thought. I suspect it would be a mix of everything. I don't think that halfling ships are particularly organized -- that is, each separate ship operates pretty independently, and likely there is some friendly competition even among halflings. This could be part of the reason that Wellby's family moved from sailing around the western Green Sea to a caravan route in Sembara, for example. But also halflings just aren't that interested as a collective in amassing wealth, so as long as they are making enough to keep their ships outfittered and keep moving, they might not really care.

  

That said they do have some areas of specialization, and a lot of the very-long-distance trade across all of Taelgar is largely associated with halflings. I think over time this would make it relatively unlikely for human merchants to even enter those markets outside of specific targeted goals. Given the much greater dangers of long distance trade in Taelgar than the real world, the risks of sending a trading fleet from Tollen to Medju are probably not worth it for most human investors.

  

So you have competition in many facets of trade, of varying intensity, combined with a kind of general disinclination among humans to outfit really long distance trade fleets, except for specific need (e.g. the Tollen dyer's guild presumably includes the makers of magical tattoos, and might be rich enough to afford to higher decently-leveled adventurers to protect their fleets to Ursk).

Some iron and exotic/extraplanar metals probably also flows in Tollen from the Skaer - given the volcanic activity across the Skaer Islands is connected in some way to the elemental planes there is likely good metal there. I was thinking perhaps Skaer steel is a thing -- doesn't quite rival the dwarves but is notable. Tollen itself doesn't feel like a place that has a significant metal-extraction industry besides gold. Silver and other metals might also come from Cymean hills, which need a reason to be somewhat rich and prosperous, and could also explain Tollen's relatively recent territorial interests in western Cymea.

Cymea might need a bit of thought here. The basic idea is a bunch of squabbling city states, vaguely Renaissance Italy in feel, and also a place that sees itself as the heirs of the Drankorian Empire in a way that Tollen/Sembara don't (perhaps a bit of Byzantine feel). I think one aspect of this is definitely that the Tollender resurgence is really a post-Great-War phenomenon, and Cymea was significantly more important as a nexus between the Green Sea, the rich and prosperous Isingue valley, and ultimately Chardon and western coast via either the Dunmari or the dwarves before the Great War. One could also imagine basically squabbling among various Cymean city states in the aftermath of the Great War, and a relatively disorganized response to the economic shocks, could have left Cymea quite vulnerable to being usurped by Tollen. Maybe even a few minor naval battles that Tollen won, resulting in taking control of the straits (perhaps initially in the name of combating piracy).

Ursk is intentionally set up to have trade enclaves where foreigners are allowed, and that would facilitate overwintering or other kinds of long term stays.

I see the east as fairly densely populated, perhaps in some ways more so than the western Green Sea. There are probably at least four other major players, beyond Ursk, Irrla, Medju, and Eastern Dunmari. You have the east coast of the continent, on the ocean side of the mountains that mark the end of the desert; the diverse populations of the magical islands (which are mostly fairly inhabited); the far northern peninsula that might be kind of Korea/northern Japan in climate and likely has its own unique culture; you have the area east of Ursk, which is totally undeveloped; and the non-desert interior inland from the Eastern Dunmari Peninsula (although actually the Eastern Dunmari are probably on the west side of the mountains that separate the peninsula from South Cymea, and it is another group that is on the peninsula). So I think there is a lot of room for a pretty robust set of civilizations out east to be developed for some later campaign or journeys. 

  

I think actually my take on Medju and that region during the Drankorian era, it was less developed, and perhaps felt like more of a periphery / minor area. The Drankorians would not have needed Medju to get whatever valuable stuff is in the desert or beyond, and major trade routes may have fed through whatever was south of the desert in the Drankorian days, across what is now the Sea of Storms.

I think this makes sense - there is a need for a third maritime power. It is definitely not Ursk, and seems like it shouldn't be Cymea. On Irrla: John's character in the Wellby one-shot was traveling east on a ship with a diplomatic mission to try to make naval alliances and get support for a rapid build up of the local navy, to deal with hobgoblin piracy. So while it might be an emerging naval power, it is definitely not an ancient maritime power. There is room for several civilizations on Irrla, though (John's character is from the Republic of Svolhas on the southeastern side; the hobgoblins control the northeastern side).

I like this basic vibe. Halflings probably have long-standing and racially based trade privileges across most of the world but they never really negotiate for specific favorable deals or work together to undercut human rivals or anything like that. And of course many halflings are motivated by the journey not the profits so you might have one caravan that keeps going to Ainswick in Sembara not because it is really particular worthwhile but because they really like the fall foliage and want an excuse to see it each year. 

  

Tollen on the other hand would have organized guilds that negotiate favorable tariffs and have significant infrastructure in many places to organize trade. 

  

Halflings might also have a whiff of unreliability about them. Not that they’d break a deal or just get bored and wander off, but they might be reluctant to commit to orders — either because they want to go where their feet take them or they want to see the goods before the buy. So, say, a Tyrwinghan glassmaker might have a deal with a Tollender factor to make 500 wineglasses each season for a fixed price and might prefer that certainty, even though it might mean they’d have less to sell to the halflings who came through and might sometimes give a better price.

Right, this is where the halflings shine — some halfling family or group is always going to be interested in these long distance routes and somehow the halflings manage to survive these in ways human competitors often can’t, even if they could get someone to back them, which is hard, because the halflings don’t need to hire extensive guards and so on, supplying that type of labor from their own community.

Agreed. I was thinking the Tollen gold is mostly sluiced/panning in one of the small rivers that flows into the Volta and so it isn’t really a “big mine” anyway. 

> Silver and other metals might also come from Cymean hills, which need a reason to be somewhat rich and prosperous, and could also explain Tollen's relatively recent territorial interests in western Cymea. 

Why does Cymea need to be rich and prosperous? My vision of it was always a bit worn down and faded. What about the idea where it was much more prosperous before the Great War,, when it was a major trading partner both East and west, trading Insiguin cotton cloth and exotic goods amongst other things. But when they recovered from the Blood Years Cymea found itself a shadow of its former self with a few merchant families clinging to relevance as brokers between Eastern Dunmari and Tollen. It’s still an agriculturally rich land with wine / olive oil / cattle (or whatever similar is climatically correct) but it isn’t prosperous exactly the way it used to be. 

  

Just an idea…

  

> > I see the east as fairly densely populated, perhaps in some ways more so than the western Green Sea. There are probably at least four other major players, beyond Ursk, Irrla, Medju, and Eastern Dunmari.

  

This is interesting and gives a better economic rational for some of the trade out East, ie some of Medju riches might be trade with the Korea-analog or the various islands. 

> > I think actually my take on Medju and that region during the Drankorian era, it was less developed, and perhaps felt like more of a periphery / minor area.

Yeah this is better. So it’s a newer power, or at least newly discovered by the west. Maybe before it was a trade center for exotic desert goods to the rest of the eastern green sea but always was secondary in the minds of the “faraway places” to drankor.

I think this is all basically right, and I think halflings should feel like they don't quite fit into typical human paradigms of trade and economics. They aren't just particularly mobile humans - they remember things no one should (racial memory), they speak to each other telepathically, they feel like they are mysterious and different. Not in a creepy or unfriendly way -- they are quite friendly and gregarious. But, maybe you are a glassmaker in Tyrwingha and one day a halfling caravan shows up you've never met and offers you double whatever anyone else is offering, because your great-great-grandfather did a favor for their great-great-grandfather. Or worse, they show up and refuse to buy from you because your great-great-grandfather wronged their great-great-grandfather. From the human perspective it would often just feel like good luck or bad luck. But of course everyone tries to put their thumb on the scales and be friendly and helpful because you don't want your descendants cursing your name for some slight you gave the halflings. And you never know what they are saying to each other because they don't talk out loud, except when they are talking to you. So maybe when they are standing there quietly looking at your wares they are asking all their relatives if you are a good or bad person, and so you give them a deal in case your ancestors wronged them, and you need to balance the scales. It should feel kind of weird for humans to be trading with halflings -- again, not in a bad way, but in a clearly non-human way. But people do it because of all the tales of folks who got rich from some unexpected halfling favor, and because they bring stories and ale and music and you have a great time drinking and eating with them, and because every now and then they'll have something strange and unexpected to sell, and you never know. 

  

But they aren't people you sign a contract with to deliver 500 wineglasses each season.

I think there is also the factor that if you are a merchant captain who is funded by some external backer in Tollen to sail to Medju and come back with spices and riches, you have obligations to that backer to come back to Tollen. You need the payoff of bringing the goods back to pay your crew, your guards, your backer, and to get rich yourself. 

  

But if you are halfling ship sailing for the sake of the journey, none of this matters. You are in Ursk, and hear rumors of hobgoblin pirates off the coast of Irrla? No worries, let's sail north instead. Or stop at one of the strange magical islands and spend six months there learning the language of whatever strange people live there. You have a lot more freedom to just take the safer route when you need to, and risk the dangerous route only when you have a good feeling about it.

  

Plus halflings are naturally lucky, so that's got to help a little too.

I think I came to the same conclusion later in my email. On the one hand it has a lot of magic and old Drankorian cities full of historical grandeur, on the other hand it just isn't a place that is dynamic and growing now. Almost might have a little bit of a modern day Italy vibe -- deep history, beautiful lands, but not necessarily a place anyone would think of as a dynamic economy. Plus add in a lot of political squabbling and lack of unity.
