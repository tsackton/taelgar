    there is a lot of conflicting information about Sembaran history w/r/t the hobgoblin wars and the plaguelands in Obsidian. my understanding is that "Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'mutte" and "Timeline of Sembaran History" capture established canon, and anything that conflicts with the details established in those docs is out-of-date/incorrect

    on a review:
    
    - "Hobgoblin Movements AFter Cha'mutte" is the canonical overview,
    - Timeline of Sembaran History is presumptively canonical, but very little of the details has actually come up in game, so changes that maintain the overall arc are feasible,
    
    The articles on the hogbolin wars in Sembara (i.e. First Hobgoblin War + Third Hobgolbin War) and the Cleenseau History Notes page should all be consistent with the above

    The pages for actual hobgoblin clans, i.e. Shattered Ice Clan look a bit outof date

    but that's why it is status/needswork/old
    
10. _[_5:18‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    I think the status tags should be fairly accurate for this type of thing
    
11. _[_5:20‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    The Cleenseau history notes contains most of the details I've introduced in game re: hobgoblin wars

    As far as Aurbez/Andonne, there is a fair bit in gazeteer. I don't have anything more than what is already there. It mostly was made up for Ausson's mini series so could plausibly have changed a bit; has not come up in my Cleenseau game at all

    ### Deciusmus _‚Äî_ 8/5/25, 5:35‚ÄØPM
    
    the notes in Refounded Alliance of Aurbez page are a good start, but the whole 1680 - 1750 historical arc of the area is pretty undeveloped. I haven't used it in my game at all, although I have vague plans to eventually go there

    okay
    
15. _[_5:37‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    i missed the status tag
    
16. _[_5:38‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    i just wanted to check as i have a lot to make up for the final arc but i didn't want to disrupt anything in your game

    I pushed a few very small updates, mostly to dm tags
    
18. _[_5:49‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    The only real constraint in the whole area from my game perspective is the note I put in the Ausson's Crossing page - basically my players really liked the vibe of the inn and the NPCs from that game, and we all want to eventually have the Cleenseau characters visit the region.

    AUsson is the family name of the propertiors of the last inn

23. _[_5:51‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    lots of details of them in the AUsson's Crossing NPCs doc, which is semi-canonical, and a few of them have moved to proper people pages, which is more actually canonical
    
24. _[_5:54‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    the "crossing" is not actually a river crossing - there isn't a river right there - but rather a small crossroads. there is a cart track that leads up towards the plateau that joins the main road

    ### Deciusmus _‚Äî_ 8/5/25, 6:06‚ÄØPM
    
    I couldn't find an actual definition
    
29. _[_6:06‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    since 1680 a town has grown up (see Laicon) around what was originally just an inn
    
30. _[_6:07‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    it is on the road somewhere north of the crossing of the Aursen and south of the crossing of the Masance
    
31. _[_6:08‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    but otherwise was never clearly defined
    
32. _[_6:09‚ÄØPM_]_
    
    the "Travelogue of Etienne of Cassons" (which doesn't have to be strictly canonical) suggests it is 6 days south of the crossing of the Masance

    trying to work out a bit of plaguelands history. this is say ~1250-1350ish, before Domain of Avatus grows. IST = Istabor Alliance. DUN = Dunmar. DS = Dwarves/Stoneborn (Ardith) at this stage, biggest question is what's in Maseau? maybe nothing, or small freehold communities, is most likely. certainly sembara is not organized enough to be here, but the Great South Road is a highly valuable trade connection (although i suspect at this time Sembara is a bit of backwater and most trade actually goes through "South Cymea")

    then, sometime (1350ish?), Avatus conquers a lot of land northwest of Istabor, but also cutting off Sembara

39. _[_8:59‚ÄØAM_]_
    
    there is definitely a front along the Westcliff in Addermarch, and I think you have details about Cleenseau but I didn't look them up
    
40. _[_8:59‚ÄØAM_]_
    
    probably have a line of Istabor castles on the Andonne plain, things like that
    
41. _[_9:00‚ÄØAM_]_
    
    but the "Istabor heartland" is not deeply threatened by Avatus, and perhaps has a close alliance with Dunmar, who are growing into the biggest military power in the area at this time
    
42. _[_9:01‚ÄØAM_]_
    
    then Sembara defeats Avatus, but hobgoblins linger in the gray hash mark areas, and this is where the high school campaign begins, with hobgoblins attacking from the mountains into Dunmar and Istabor
    
43. _[_9:02‚ÄØAM_]_
    
    Then you get the Great War where Isingue is beseiged and eventually the plague blankets the whole upper Istaros and eastern parts of Dunmar, cutting of the Dunmari from relieving the siege of Isingue and isolating the Sembaran armies

    ### rsulfuratus _‚Äî_ 8/6/25, 9:05‚ÄØAM
    
    so questions: does the positioning of the domain of avatus look about right to you? do you have anything in mind for what might exist in the green ?? area before Avatus? this sets up Aurbez plateau especially as having been mostly unsettled prior to the great war - this is hobgoblin territory almost entirely from fall of Drankor to defeat of Cha'mutte; does that work with the vibe of Aurbez in 1680, 1720?
    
45. _[_9:06‚ÄØAM_]_
    
    an alternate positioning puts hobgoblins and avatus mostly east of the plateau, pushing more agains the western border of Istabor, and leaves space for some isolated humans perhaps living with dwarves/stoneborn help on the plateau

    ### Deciusmus _‚Äî_ 8/6/25, 10:17‚ÄØAM
    
    A few thoughts/notes... (a) My thinking re: Maseau has been entirely post-Atavaus, basically on the assumption that whatever was there before was radically transformed by the dominion of Atavus and therefore not relevant to later Sembaran history. (b) Cleenseau History Notes are worth reading re: Great South Road. There was a human settlement on the south bank of the Enst around the fall of Drankor, and the Dukes of Wisford controlled Cleenseau region (but probably not south of the Enst) from the 1200s or so (i.e. pre-Sembara)
    
48. _[_10:21‚ÄØAM_]_
    
    the Chronicle of Sembaran history doc suggests fairly depopulated land south of the Enst, with no major human settlements, although that doesn't really have to be canon. There is a Duchy of Brovna around Ulrich Pass that I have eventual plans for as a historical entity that was not part of Sembara for a while - remember there was a growing link in the 1250s - 1400s Sembara <-> Chardon through Ulrich, which might have been a competitor route for goods from South Cymea (i.e. Cymean -> Isingue -> Brovna -> Chardon rather than Cymean -> Isingue -> Dunmar -> Chardon)
    
49. _[_10:23‚ÄØAM_]_
    
    I see Avatus as basically opportunistic, gets established in fairly lightly populated place between major powers, and then turns north rather than south because sembara is much weaker than Isginue, especially the western duchies
