(Jan 2021)

Let me know what you think, I can try to write it into the main religion doc if you like the general thrust.

The eastern religion has its roots in the ancient intercessory belief from the mariner culture of Hkar. The tradition involved the idea that prayers to the Divine are given to one of the great beings: the earth, the sky, or the sea. And then these beings bring them to the Divine. Except when the wind (a fourth entity) steals them away (although the mischievous wind of course does not always steal blessings, sometimes they carry the blessing you didn't dare ask, or steal your enemy's blessing).

Over time, this results in a religion with four great gods: the Sky, the Earth, the Ocean, and the Wind, loosely personified, but seen more as the conduits to the Divine. Over time, helpers of these great gods are mixed into: the spirits of islands (the children of earth and ocean), and the cloud spirits (the children of ocean and sky). The spirits provide guidance and advice and support to humans, but ultimately, there remains a strong sense that the Divine (Ahra/Malik) is the 'real' god.

Not sure how this plays out in the farther east, but this develops into two traditions in the Greater Sembaran region: the Kestavo, and the Skaer religion


The Kestavo tradition is born of two main things:

* The easterns moving inland, and losing the daily connection to the sea

* Encounters and intermixing with the spiritual traditions of the northerns

  

This results in a religion that loses the specific spirits (the clouds and islands) of the eastern religion, but keeps a few major 'primordial' gods around the Earth, the Sky, and probably the mountains. And gains a massive influx in the idea of lots of small gods and small spirits, from the northerners.

  

The Skaer tradition on the other hand doubles down on the ocean. The idea develops that the only important god is the ocean itself, and all intercession with Arha and Malik goes through the ocean. The ocean stays only loosely personified, and a culture develops that Arha and Malik enable the great ocean to perform miracles <some ideas about whales, waves, and specific ocean spirits and how they might play out>. But ultimately Skaer is a religion where all worship is really around the personified ocean, who is the great artibitor and intercessor with Arha and Malik.

====

Something about this doesn't quite feel right to me. Thinking out loud, not necessarily committed to any of this:

  

One thing is that I think that with the metaphysical structure of gods in Taelgar, the pace of change of actual gods themselves (as opposed to theological beliefs or worship practices) would be very slow, especially since the fall of Hkar. From the point of view of a god, why would they want to allow themselves to drift apart into separate entities? And from the point of view of humans, in a world where interventionist gods are common and really powerful, the incentive to send your prayers to the most powerful god around is really, really strong. 

  

So, once you have four great gods, why do you start giving your prayers and beliefs to a bunch of little forest spirits who have only a tiny fraction of the power of the great god you inexplicably no longer worship. Just because you aren't living a seafaring life isn't really enough, unless the god you were worshipping has a domain of power that is strictly limited to the sea, and so can't help you inland.

  

There is also a question of whether Ahra and Malik can, indeed, grant prayers, or at least prayers brought via intercessionary gods. So what is really happening, metaphysically, in these religions? My current sense is that all these little nature spirits and ancestor spirits function kind of like warlocks of the Ahra and/or Malik. Humans cannot access Ahra and Malik's power, but other divines can of course, that is what they do, and so they can then grant that power to their followers.

  

So, I think this would mean there are really two distinct traditions in Taelgar: first, there are the intercessionary traditions, which are more like what we made in up college. Ahra and Malik are the only actual source of power in this system. Indeed, these would tend to select for lots of small local gods, because what matters is bandwidth of an individual god to hear your prayer and pass it on, not some kind of sense of the divine resevoirs of the being you are praying too. So you get the northern tradition, which develops along a few lines but always, ultimately, the gods are just a conduit. In some cases, this is very animistic, in other cases it might develop towards ancestor worship / veneration of great heroes. But if for example you were to play a cleric from this religion, you'd likely have a personal god in some sense, and 'being a cleric' would just mean there is a small god somewhere that listens especially to you.

  

Second, there are the pantheonic traditions, where gods accumulate enough belief/power/whatever to act, themselves, in the world. They are still ultimately metaphysically drawing power from Ahra and Malik, but for practical purposes these gods have enough real, significant power that they can grant prayers directly. 

  

I think the idea that there is one god that it is go-between for worshippers and Ahra/Malik doesn't really fit into this system directly. Why doesn't that god just act in the world directly? 

  

I really, really like the way the northerner religion developed, as a kind of shinto/animism/guardian spirit religion, with some potential ideas about ancestor worship through in, but where the fundamental divine power is Ahra/Malik (and perhaps they even see Ahra and Malik as kind of two names for the same thing, so there is really just one overgod and a bunch of warlock-spirits, not even really fully fledged gods, delivering prayers). 

  

Just thinking about design space and actual in-game experience, I think it is valuable to keep this distinct and unusual. Like, if you meet a northerner, or sail out to the western islands, what is really the kind of distinct unusual thing you first notice is how differently organized their religion is. Because of this, I'd prefer not to have another northern sometimes seafaring culture that also has a religion based around intercessory worship of Ahra and Malik.

  

If we want another intercessory culture, or have other ideas, could stick that in the south. Or maybe ancestor worship fits better in the south and not a kind of mixed up part of the northern culture. Or maybe in the south people somehow figure out a way to get Ahra and Malik to here them directly, like maybe there is a tradition like buddhism that involves mediation and altering your state of mind in a way that you can summon the divine spark within to work divine magic without a god, exactly. Alternatively, one of these ideas (ancestor worship or meditation) could become the eastern religion. 

  

In any case, I think I would avoid an intercessionary religion with a small number of major gods as the intercessories with Ahra and Malik, 

  

As far as how this plays out with the Skaer and the Kestavo. One possibility is that the Kestavo, especially, are basically a northern religion. Maybe there are some weak eastern influences depending on what "eastern" ends up being, but this is really the northern ideal of small intercessory gods. Since we've moved the center of eastern culture from the Sembara/western gulf to the far east, there is no reason why the Sembaran highlands can't have cultural affinities with the northerners. Of course it would be a unique, blended culture since this is basically the edge of both cultural groups.

  

Just thinking about kind of rough ideas about religion and drawing from the suggestions in the DMG, one thing that Taelgar currently lacks is actually the traditional D&D loose pantheon structure. So maybe this would fit for the easterners. I think loose pantheons are kind of less interesting if they are all there is, but a loose pantheon might be an interesting take for a kind of broadly distributed, relatively old and never centralized culture, as it would give a lot of opportunity for different gods to have prominence in different areas. The Skaer could then, potentially have abandoned most or all of the gods and be basically a monotheistic culture of one member of that loose pantheon (meaning not that they deny the existence of the rest, but that they believe one is supreme above all or something like that). The Kestavo maybe doesn't fit quite as well in this framework...still thinking.

  

Or, there is no reason at all why Taelgar couldn't sustain a third tight pantheon. Tight pantheons really work well for the metaphysics of Taelgar, I think. 

  

Interested in your takes.

===

I think the metaphysical issues you raise are quite valid. I really like the northern religion, and I like how a lot of the ideas fit both into what I like about the 'Sembaran' version of Mos Numera and the Kestavo, which I really think works better with the animistic/shaman feel and ancient glaciers with a specific ice guardian spirit and so on. So I was trying to give an Eastern religion something of that same flavor. 

  

One way of cutting the knot is just make the Kestavo a northern religion (as you suggest). Maybe the easterners never really made it east of Skaegenland, and the highland/north Vostok culture is really northern-inspired not eastern-inspired culture. That actually works well -- there is no reason for the easterners to have spread away from the coasts at all, keeping them much more (in the original pre-downfall version at least), ocean-centric. And the northerners feel like the sorts that would befriend the dwarves and end up on both sides of the central mountains with dwarven intermediaries. That could even be kinda interesting in the current Sembaran climate, if the northern highland culture has very ancient ties to dwarves.

  

So that could make Tollen more interesting. It becomes the most cosmopolitan city on Taelgar -- unlike Chardon, which although powerful, rich, and very very urban, is really dominated by a single culture, Tollen is where the northern highlanders (from North Vostok and the Sembaran highland kingdoms), and the easterners (from Skaeganland and farther east, and perhaps the Vostok coast), and the Drankorians (from Cymea), and the Sembarans all kinda mix. An immigrant NYC vibe to Chardon's Beijing or Paris vibe.

  

And that pushes towards making the northern intercessionary religion very unique, which is kinda cool - and probably changes some of the early history of Taelgar. Basically, once the pantheonic gods started to come into being, the whole idea of intercession with Ahra and Malik starts to fade, and it really becomes a unique 'northern' thing.

  

As far as the eastern religion, I can see lots of possibilities, a few thoughts:

  

* Ancestor worship: could be quite interesting, especially if it results in god emperors ruling from beyond the grave as risen gods and so on. Or if it ties into with Polynesean 'culture hero' tropes and maybe that side of things isn't part of the northern religion. But it does leave it somewhat similar, in the intercession side. I think this is better left unused for now. There are some cool ideas, but probably better to let them sit and see if they end up fitting into the developing north -- it seems like there is always the south for cool ideas with no other home, but if this one fits into the north it feels better to end up there rather than in the east.

  

* A loose pantheon. I find this a bit uninspiring. But it would be a good choice if we want all of the eastern cultures to have more unique religions. It is easy to see how a loose pantheon could have developed in very different ways as everyone settled on different places in the east and so the 'eastern' religion itself is kinda gone (like the Hkar religion before the 8 and the siblings split). This could work well with ideas about Skaeganland having an ocean monotheism of a sort. But it means there is no guiding light to the cultural development of the area, which is a downside.

  

Another tight pantheon seems reasonable, but it would be nice to think of a way to make it unique. This is broadstroke culture, not a Dunmari-sized ethnic group (and by the way, I think there is clearly room in the story for other folks to have left Hkar around the same time as the Dunmari, and be scattered about in various places, if it ever makes sense). But I think these scattered small cultures are a better place for 'just another tight pantheon'.

  

One  idea on how to make a tight pantheon unique is to play up mystery cults. I was reading earlier about Mithras and other Greek mystery cults and something like that could be pretty interesting. It is easy to see how a tight pantheon with a strong mystery cult tradition might have spun off a some of the mystery cults as unique religions (i.e. Skagenland religion started as a mystery cult to the ocean goddess, with its own rituals and initiations and so on, and eventually, all Skaegar people were kinda inducted into the cult). This could also have some interesting tie ins to necromancy and evil cults and worshippers of the Three Despairs. It could be interesting to have a part of Taelgar with the religious tradition is all in on cult-like beliefs.

  

The other idea I like is your meditation idea. That could be cool to develop.

  

So I guess I'd be included to suggest going either in a meditation and almost monotheistic worship of Ahra and Malik direction, or in a tight pantheon but with a strong mystery cult vibe (and so a lot of eastern cultures today might worship the same basic 4-5 gods, but with very different rituals from place to place).

Yeah, I think this works. So, I would then tweak slightly to have the northerns spread across the far north, as far east as the Vostok mountains, and then into the highlands of the central mountains - but not the coast. So Tyrwinghna, Cymea, coastal Vostok, and Skaer Islands are ancestrally easterner, albeit far 'fringe' Easterner, so to speak. This impacts language, though, and would probably mean revising a lot of the names for the Sembaran highland kingdoms, so that they actually feel quite *different* from the lowlands/islands. I need to revisit my language docs with these new developments, but I do think it is really useful to keep the northerner language feeling very distinct. I have been using Semitic languages, as opposed to Indo-European for the rest of the northwest/east, but could revisit.

Yes, this fits very well with my idea of Tollen.

Right, I think this works. This is what I was going for.

Yeah, agreed, this is what I would lean towards as well. Also worth keeping in mind the Southerners are the second group to leave Hkar, so even with a trajectory in Hkar of the ideas about intercession going out of favor as time passes since Creation, it would still be plausible for the southerners, at the tail end of the early migration, to still cling to some of those ideas. So it puts them in a good position to accumulate cool ideas with no other home as they are coming at a potentially unsettled time in Hkaran development.

So, of course, this is kind of the unique thing about the Dunmari, especially the eastern Dunmari, and is critical to a number of plot points in the Dunmar campaign, so I don't really want to put this elsewhere. But let me think a bit about other spins on tight pantheons.

Yeah I may think about this a bit. Of course, the idea here is that it is some unique/interesting discovery, so this could be out east somewhere (or anywhere, really) but not 'ancestral' to the culture.

Right. There are not that many names, I'm happy to do a semitic variant on the highlands. Lots of sources for Hebrew/Arabic names. I want to think a little bit about the impact on Sembaran history. The Sembaran story does need the highland culture and the lowland culture at the time of the Drankorian conquest to be similar (as opposed to say, the lowlanders are eastern and highlanders northern) in order to make the back and forth conquest and loss of the highland kingdoms work, and to make the Sembaran Mos Numera reasonably inspired/influenced by highland culture, which is the point of all this :)

Right -- that makes sense. Somehow that point about Dunmari culture didn't stick with me, and I don't currently have access to any of the Dunmari religious notes :-). But agreed it doesn't make sense to overlap here, if Dunmar has taken this niche.

One thing that struck me was your "weird magic, obviously" comment for the big island chain at the entrance to the Green Sea. That place has all kinds of possibilities for being a place where Things Happened(tm). It could also be a useful foil for making the southern areas even more isolated, if we wanted. You could imagine not actually being able to easily sail out of the Green Sea to the Endless Ocean at all. So trade from the south maybe has to come up along the coast in slow caravans, rather than sailing.

  

I actually feel like what Taelgar needs is a bit of a 'neutral' culture that can be assimilated by Drankor in the Sembaran region, but that isn't really distinct enough to have left a mark. It picked up some influences from the northerners, and from the easterners, but ultimately when Drankor came through it kinda just flavored the Drankorian culture a bit. 

  

Here, what do you think of this...
  

The easterners, a pantheonic mariner culture, left Hkar in two waves, settling at first amongst the many islands of the Green Sea. But Something Happened(tm) amongst the islands and a schism developed. Many easterns stayed in the east, around the islands and the northern shores of the Green Sea. These people eventually became the ~ColdMagocracy~, the ~BigIsland~, the ~FarNorthPeninsula~ and the ~EntranceIsland~ people. They basically stay in a rectangle formed by the big island, the near coast to the big island, the far penisula, and the southern coast by the entrance islands. But they don't really settle on the south coast of the Green Sea anywhere. This group shares a religion (or set of related religions) that is strongly associated with Ahra and Malik directly, with some meditation magic or something. Perhaps some aspects of Buddhism. Perhaps a revered human founder (maybe one of the only human religious founders, the gods taking the credit for all the other religions). 

  

The second half of the easterners headed further west, ultimately in some fashion wanted to get away from their erstwhile brethren. They settle on the Vostok, Cymean, and ~SouthCymean~ coasts, Skagenland, and around the Western Gulf. Whatever Weird Event inspired the new religion out east, these people want no part in it. As they spread up the rivers in Sembara, they encountered the northerns in the highlands, and in Vostok and Sembara, a new religion developed (the Kestavo). When the Drankorian empire moved into the region, the Cymean and South Cymean easterners quickly assimilated, as did most of the Sembaran 'east northerners'.  What is left in the region of this group is the Vostok/Sembaran highland 'Kestavo' culture, and the Skager, and maybe a bit of a unique Tollen culture, along the north coast of the Western Gulf and coastal Vostok.

  

So you end up with, in the Green Sea:

  

* The pseudo-monotheists out east, dominating the northeast of the Green Sea and the entrance islands, and perhaps broadly inward looking. Linguistically Eastern, but with a unique religion.
	
  

* The southern coast, today is really three cultures, none with eastern origins: 

** the Eastern Dunmari (although who knows what influences they picked up out here)

** the "mystery people" of the far south eastern Endless Ocean shore (not going to spend brainpower on them right now, but could be anything -- not a factor in any campaign)

** Cymea and South Cymea, which whatever they end up evolving into, are both Drankorian successor states and don't preserve anything of the ancient easterns, and clearly Mos Numera

  

* The interior is really two cultures:

* Sembara, which preserves its 'east northern' blended culture only in its specific take on Mos Numera

* the highlands and northern Vostok, which preserve much more of the east northern blended culture and have a unique religion, the Kestavo

* Tyrwingha? How do they end up worshiping the Eight Divines? 

  

* The north coast, today, is a little less clear:

** Skagenland, with a clear eastern origin but with its own unique religion centered around a single ocean god. 

** ?? who knows what along the central north coast between Skagenland and the big island. Nothing? Non-humans? Hobgoblins? Another culture? the Arha/Malik worshippers from bullet #1?

** Coastal Vostok and Tollen, which are either a similar blended east northern culture as the highlands, or a new somewhat unique eastern holdout culture, or simply like Sembara, were whatever they were but fell under the Drankorian sphere and now are basically Drankorian with a bit of a twist
