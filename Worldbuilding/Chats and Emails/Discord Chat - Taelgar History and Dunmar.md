e: Taelgar history, i think the problem with (d) is that, in general, the modern day details don't really exist either
so it is hard to make up a history
we have some brainstorming notes, i believe, that attempt to explain why drankor expanded north and west, but not really east very far, since the geography is a bit atypical for an empire in some sense
Deciusmus — Today at 2:53 PM
yeah there is a lot of brainstorming notes that I haven't fully looked through
rsulfuratus — Today at 2:57 PM
i think from a worldbuilding perspective, the stuff east of the mountains east of drankor is canonically 'not Drankorian' but beyond that it is a bit of a blank slate, intentionally so
Deciusmus — Today at 2:58 PM
Right the area I'm talking about is this yellow circle:

but i guess this leaves (d) as kind of a big hole that could use filling, since that is west of those mountains
yeah
Deciusmus — Today at 2:58 PM
Everything to the east of that circle is "intentionally poorly defined"
rsulfuratus — Today at 2:58 PM
a good chunk of southern part of that circle was rostaure
basically the entire north shore of that weird bay
Deciusmus — Today at 2:59 PM
to the west and north (with a few exceptions around Cymea) is fairly well defined
rsulfuratus — Today at 2:59 PM
no idea what is there now, though. presumably wilderness
Deciusmus — Today at 3:00 PM
is rostaure meant to be another surival of the big pre-downfall elves? or a new foundation
?
we had a lot of talk earlier about a huge Pantal/Everglades inland swamp, but I think that was to the east of the circle
I think the theory is that most of that coastline along the green sea (between the mountain ranges) would have been empty land post-Downfall
rsulfuratus — Today at 3:01 PM
never decided
i think the big lizardfolk swamps became the southern green sea after the downfall
but were east of the mountains, anyway
Deciusmus — Today at 3:03 PM
In a bunch of the green sea brainstorming we had discussed the fact that there is no large swampland on Taelgar, and I think were considering something south of the "mariener trade peninusla" as having survived
but that's in the "intentionally blank space" out east
rsulfuratus — Today at 3:03 PM
right, yeah
Deciusmus — Today at 3:04 PM
In fact, it is really only the red circle here that is poorly defined:

![[discord-chat-taelgar-history-image.png]]
the squiggly yellow presumably never recovers from the plague. Although it isn't clear to me where the proto-Dunmari were or came from or went to
the blue circle becomes Isingue
rsulfuratus — Today at 3:07 PM
early on, i had the dunmari migration from undetermined homeland split, with some going ??? (variously, what we later called MTP or the red circle), and the rest continuing west to Dunmar
although the split is canonical, i've increasingly felt it doesn't really make sense for the other part of the dunmari to have settled so close to Dunmar (e.g, red circle), separated only from  Dunmar by Isingue (which is hardly a barrier)
it
it's never really fit with the vibe of Dunmar for there to have been a second branch of the Dunmari so close - it really only works if they are far/distant/lost somehow
Deciusmus — Today at 3:09 PM
So would it make sense for the dunmari homeland to be "out east" and after the split some of them went back towards the homeland?
rsulfuratus — Today at 3:09 PM
that seems more logical
Deciusmus — Today at 3:09 PM
canonically the split was in the headwaters of that river that divides the yellow and red areas, right?
rsulfuratus — Today at 3:10 PM
it is not clearly determined, actually
Deciusmus — Today at 3:10 PM
But actually having the Dunmari homeland way out east simplifies alot of the Drankorian cultural history, as the Dunmari can just "appear" from nowhere basically, they were either on the fringes of Drankor or just far enough away that Drankor was only a legend
story/whatever
the other question that came up on the dunmari migration is... were there any drankorians still in the coastal plain they were riding into? or is this meant to all be plague-scarred and depopulated?
rsulfuratus — Today at 3:12 PM
the traditional three great rivers of Dunmar are the Hara, Kharja, and Mahar (Istaros), and the country is more or less founded on the banks of the Kharja. 

but the split could happen either at the Istaros (Mahar) or an eastern tributary
re: drankorians - it is not necesarily clear how true the religious history of the dunmari has to be.
but the vibe of the founding myth is supposed to be:
dunmari ride, driven by their gods, into what is basically a dying land. exactly how/why the land is dying is not stated, but presumably an aftereffect of the plague
jeevali performs great miracle to heal the land, makes everything better, dies, is reborn
the dunmari kill / drive out everyone who was living there, saying the gods saved the land for them
so the implication is that some people may have survived. or, possibly, it was undead, or plague demons, or ???
Deciusmus — Today at 3:17 PM
Right. So a canonical way of putting it might be:

Shortly after the fall of Drankor, a new people, the Dunmari, sweep west, from an undetermined homeland somewhere east of the Drankorian sphere of influence.
These Dunmari, speaking a unique language and worshipping their own gods, rapidly establish a new homeland  - that they claim their gods have given to them - across the coastal plains
Whatever they are displacing - surviving humans? undead? plague demons? - is not clear, but by (XXX date) the sweap of land from (X) to (Y) is clearly Dunmari
rsulfuratus — Today at 3:18 PM
yeah the vibe is supposed to be somewhat like spread of islam right after the death of muhammad - very quick
