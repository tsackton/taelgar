[2023-01-04 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. the one thing I might want to keep is having weather associated with the wyrdling, not the wildling, playing up the association with chance/luck/fate and storms. which also indirectly makes the wyrdling a sort of alternate patron of sailors of a sort
[2023-01-04 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: I liked having the weather with the wildling
[2023-01-04 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: but it could move..
[2023-01-04 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: maybe the wyrdling is associated with the effect of the weather, whereas the wildling is associated with the weather itself
[2023-01-04 10:40 PM] Deciusmus: that isn't explained that well... But the wildling seems like the one who would be associated with a major storm or whatever, the divine who is tied to the changing of the seasons and the monsoon and things like that
[2023-01-04 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus: right, I think I see what you are saying
[2023-01-04 10:40 PM] Deciusmus: the wyrdling though might be associated with the luck of the wind, the chance of rain; the one sailors pray to for good winds
[2023-01-04 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus: if the monsoon rains don't come you worry that you offended the wilding; if you want good weather for your wedding day you make an offering to wyrdling
[2023-01-04 10:41 PM] Deciusmus: right, exactly
[2023-01-04 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus: I like that the Eight Divines are generally pretty impersonal and abstract, since it fits with the kind of Drankorian feeling. but I also think it is nice to have some that play against type so to speak and the wyrdling seems a good candidate. also contrasts with the very impersonal sense of the wildling as nature writ large
[2023-01-04 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus: the sibyl and maybe the wanderer also might have that kind of more personal feeling, with the mother, the father, and the wildling as the most vast and impersonal
[2023-01-04 10:50 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I like that
[2023-01-04 10:51 PM] Deciusmus: I have one player who is a paladin of the wanderer and one who is a trickster domain fey-curious priest of the wyrdling from Tyrwingha
[2023-01-04 10:51 PM] Deciusmus: So these are going to come up a lot
