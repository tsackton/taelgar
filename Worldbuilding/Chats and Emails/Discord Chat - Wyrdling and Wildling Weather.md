yeah. the one thing I might want to keep is having weather associated with the wyrdling, not the wildling, playing up the association with chance/luck/fate and storms. which also indirectly makes the wyrdling a sort of alternate patron of sailors of a sort

I liked having the weather with the wildling


[1/4/2023 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
but it could move..

maybe the wyrdling is associated with the effect of the weather, whereas the wildling is associated with the weather itself


[1/4/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
that isn't explained that well... But the wildling seems like the one who would be associated with a major storm or whatever, the divine who is tied to the changing of the seasons and the monsoon and things like that


[1/4/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think I see what you are saying


[1/4/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
the wyrdling though might be associated with the luck of the wind, the chance of rain; the one sailors pray to for good winds


[1/4/2023 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus
if the monsoon rains don't come you worry that you offended the wilding; if you want good weather for your wedding day you make an offering to wyrdling


[1/4/2023 10:41 PM] .deciusmus
right, exactly

I like that the Eight Divines are generally pretty impersonal and abstract, since it fits with the kind of Drankorian feeling. but I also think it is nice to have some that play against type so to speak and the wyrdling seems a good candidate. also contrasts with the very impersonal sense of the wildling as nature writ large


[1/4/2023 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
the sibyl and maybe the wanderer also might have that kind of more personal feeling, with the mother, the father, and the wildling as the most vast and impersonal
