Tweaking the before... there are basically four regions:

  ![[ardonne-old-map.png]]

The ashen plains (dark red on map). Borderlands of the plaguelands. No real people, but not truly plague-filled. Biggest issue for these places is the polluted Ardonne river and the ash storms. (In 1650 this region would stretch through basically all of the light red region).

  

The central March of Ardonne (light red on map). Ranchers and open grassland. Dry, similar to say western Kansas or eastern Colorado. Ashy summer storms can cause issues for agriculture so most don't try. Fortified ranches are the main settlements. Some dependence on food imports/trade. Most settlements clustered around the Dunmar Road and the ruins of the Great South Road. (This region is unsettled in 1650 except right along the road)

  

The river borderlands (pale yellow). A mix of marcher castles protecting small scale irrigation-driven farms, goat-and-sheep herders, and self-sufficient frontier farms that depend on hunting, fishing, small vegetable crops and ranching. Mostly claimed by no kingdom but many of the frontier farms are loyal to Aurbez, and the marcher lords are often loyal to Maseau or Sembara. But the population density (perhaps no more than 2000 people in the whole region) is low enough that there is little conflict. (In 1650, there would have been no Marcher castles here, just a handful of frontier folk and refugees)

  

The Aurbez Plateau (brown). Colorado Front Range climate. The heart of the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez. Biggest settlements are around the marsher upper Aursen before it spills off the plateau in a series of waterfalls just before the road crosses the river. Most of the people are tucked away in the mountains, especially the southern stretches. I'm still not totally sure what form of polity the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez is, but in 1650 it didn't exist, and the people living here were very similar to the frontier folk of the river borderlands.

Yeah I like this a lot. 

  

Worth also keeping in mind that the Plaguelands is not actually filled with literal red mist these days - this is really the Sembaran name for the region reflecting fear and history. There are hobgoblins trying to make a living in the river valley that drains to the Istaros from Addermarch, for example, and there would be tons of rumors of what is out there -- kind of like the Dunmari frontier, but without the supernatural protection. And weird aberrations and monstrosities sometimes make their way out the heart of the plaguelands to attack. There are probably also stories - even in 1650 and especially 1750 -- of the riches you can find, and probably some complicated feelings about the ruined, abandoned cities. Few of the refugees would have gotten away with all their material wealth so there would literally be lots of riches of the ancestors of the current Aurbez people for those who could survive the dangers. 

  

Lots of potential for what pollutes the river, too. Is it Abyssal corruption? The ash itself? This could be a magical analog of the idea that diseases can get carried across the Atlantic in giant dust clouds from the Sahara. Or is it damage from the Great War that cannot be easily undone (the Ardonne was filled with the bodies of the dead, so thick you could walk for days on their corpses, that sort of thing). 

  

I hope you are putting this all in a doc somewhere.
