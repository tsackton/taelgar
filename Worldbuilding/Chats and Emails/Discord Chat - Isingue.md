Have you invented anything about Insingue, really? I am trying to get a bit of a sense of the culture, like what would their unique take on Mirthblaze be? Culturally they are fairly Sembaran, I guess


[8/8/2023 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
No, not really


[8/8/2023 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
All I have on them is in the March of Andonne doc in drive


[8/8/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
But none of it was really about insingue


[8/8/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
More about the refugee culture in Aurbez which I think might be fairly different from what Insingue was actually like


[8/8/2023 10:03 PM] rsulfuratus
our assumption is Insingue was a pretty fertile and wealthy agricultural region, right? before the plague it would have been like southern france or tuscany or something, I guess, although perhaps a bit more rain


[8/8/2023 10:04 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, wealthy and fertile for sure. Big trade with Cymea and Sembara and perhaps even out to Chardon.


[8/8/2023 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
In high school it was around where Beryl was from


[8/8/2023 10:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[8/8/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
It has always been a bit of a cipher though


[8/8/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
Like, why is there a big city there? Was it more cymean or sembaran?


[8/8/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
I think in the Drankorian expansion notes there were not many humans in the region when drankor expanded into it


[8/8/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
I always imagine it as river town


[8/8/2023 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, definitely a river town


[8/8/2023 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I always thought of it as kind of Drankorian but always like the second city of the empire, that survived the plague and rebuilt but took on a kind of independent spirit


[8/8/2023 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
the scholars fled west, the merchants fled to cymea, and the pioneers fled to insingue


[8/8/2023 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe it was protected from the first plague that destroyed drankor by some powerful magic so it has this kind of refuge in a land of devastation feeling right after the fall of the drankorian empire


[8/8/2023 10:11 PM] rsulfuratus
but had always been kind of a hotbed of anti-imperial sentiment (maybe some simmering remnants of the pre-Apolloyon civil war there)


[8/8/2023 10:11 PM] .deciusmus
Independence is a good key idea, it certainly fits in with the refugee culture in Maseau and south I‚Äôve very lightly developed


[8/8/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe a free trade place as well


[8/8/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
insingue to drankor is almost exactly the distance from rome to cairo. could have a kind of eyppt during roman times vibe


[8/8/2023 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
close enough you can get grain shipments down the river and trade, but far enough away it isn't directly under the imperial thumb


[8/8/2023 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
It also could have been completely different during the Drankorian times. Maybe before the plague it was a sleepy river port funneling grain south to drankor from (one of?) the breadbasket of the empire


[8/8/2023 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
right, doesn't necessarily matter that far back


[8/8/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
Then some historically contingent set of leaders escapes the plague to Insingue and it gets this reputation as something else ‚Äî an anti-imperial / we are very much not drankor rebirth


[8/8/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
But in reality this is a contrast with Cymea not Drankor


[8/8/2023 10:17 PM] rsulfuratus
right, the important thing is that in the east Cymea initially has the kind of Drankor-continued vibe and Isingue is explicitly not that


[8/8/2023 10:18 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[8/8/2023 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think its wealth would be from agriculture more than trade - it is on an important river and at a crossroads of cymea/sembara trade to dunmar and on to chardon, but as it is completely landlocked it is hard for it to be a really major trading power


[8/8/2023 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus
my mental model is kind of southern france


[8/8/2023 10:20 PM] .deciusmus
You could imagine three major post Drankorian urban cultures‚Äî
Chardon is the ‚Äúwe will become greater than even our Drankorian roots‚Äù culture, Cymea the ‚Äúrelish the past, we will never improve on it‚Äù culture, and Insingue is the ‚Äúwe are nothing at all like Drankor, we reject its principles‚Äù culture


[8/8/2023 10:21 PM] .deciusmus
By why a big city in southern france? Or maybe insignue is not very urban and it is the dense agricultural land not the city itself that matters (as the city is small)


[8/8/2023 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think of insingue as particularly a big city


[8/8/2023 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the river valley would be densely settled with many small towns, so fairly high population density, but not sure that insingue would really be a huge city by itself


[8/8/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah actually that makes sense


[8/8/2023 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe historically the region was called something different, but Insingue is a symbol and now has kind of a "well are all insinguese" vibe


[8/8/2023 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I had the name Isatabor Alliance somewhere


[8/8/2023 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking similar but also that maybe Insingue was major (intellectual/religious/magical?) focus so everyone in the region saw it as something important


[8/8/2023 10:26 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I think that was the name of the region


[8/8/2023 10:26 PM] .deciusmus
/ political entity


[8/8/2023 10:27 PM] rsulfuratus
right, Insingue was a center, no doubt, and kind of a cultural capital, but not necessarily hugely populated


[8/8/2023 10:28 PM] .deciusmus
Right I think that works well


[8/8/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
How about Revelfire for a name for the twilight revelry / wyrdling one?


[8/8/2023 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
I like that well enough. Although I wouldn‚Äôt discount fake Latin either


[8/8/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm yeah maybe fake latin woud be better


[8/8/2023 10:44 PM] .deciusmus
On Insignue, here‚Äôs one idea‚Ä¶
Something about the waters of the river near / in Insignue has healing and fertility properties. This works on soil too so the land is unusually rich. This attracts folks, but a rejection of the Drankorian ritual study leads the people who come here to be much more mystical/divine magic so a university doesn‚Äôt develop but the town becomes a cult center for Mos Numena and a place of divine connection. This is never large, but there is plenty of wealth in the soil, and the small towns are all attached very strongly to the place they get the magic plant growing (and human fertility causing) water


[8/8/2023 10:45 PM] .deciusmus
This generates a lot of wealth and a cultural focus (and an interesting magical twist, did Cha‚Äômutte corrupt the healing power? Or suppress it?)


[8/8/2023 10:46 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm yeah that is quite interesting


[8/8/2023 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
and could explain why the acidic ooze there now has grown so big


[8/8/2023 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
But the rejection of drankor leads to a lot of New England style town meetings and local rule, united  by this shared heritage / culture / economic / magical connection back to the source of the water


[8/8/2023 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
probably makes sense to have a bit of a druidic focus, which would also be consistent with beryl's backstory


[8/8/2023 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that works


[8/8/2023 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps the rangers could also have an insinguese root, maybe originally as the guardians of these magical waters


[8/8/2023 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
they existed in the high school campaign so need to have a pre-Great-War origin story


[8/8/2023 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
and also a reason to be heavily focused specifically on the southern border of Sembara


[8/8/2023 10:50 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[8/8/2023 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus
could also contribute to the cultural relevancy of insigue - this would be the rangers headquarters or mystical center or something


[8/8/2023 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus
might push the rangers towards the "reclaim isingue" side in your campaign, not sure if that works or not


[8/8/2023 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno-  they could easily see themselves as the guardians of the humans who escaped more than reclaimed land


[8/8/2023 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps there are factions between those who believe the waters can be restored and those who don‚Äôt


[8/8/2023 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm yeah that could be interesting


[8/8/2023 10:53 PM] .deciusmus
The rangers might be originally and at heart the guardians of the magic of the land, not the cultural trappings of the city


[8/8/2023 10:54 PM] .deciusmus
So reclaiming the town -
Who cares


[8/8/2023 10:54 PM] .deciusmus
Reclaiming the magic -
Key


[8/8/2023 10:54 PM] .deciusmus
And if it seemed important for them to be on a side, Beryl could have told them whether reclaiming the water is possible


[8/8/2023 10:55 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe beryl thought it was possible and told Rai and the Bhishma monks to try it......................


[8/8/2023 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
That would be awesome


[8/8/2023 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
But I‚Äôll let you decide if it really happened üòÄ


[8/8/2023 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
When was Rai and the monks?


[8/8/2023 10:56 PM] .deciusmus
It was like 1720s, right?


[8/8/2023 10:56 PM] rsulfuratus
1718


[8/8/2023 10:57 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe Rai succeeded and the magical water is now super back and giving major fertility power to the giant acid monster


[8/8/2023 10:57 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe


[8/8/2023 10:59 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure how big a role the rangers play in your campaign but feel free to have some reverberations echoing back to the rangers via beryl if it make sense


[8/8/2023 10:59 PM] .deciusmus
It‚Äôs my bedtime but I might try to add a few thoughts on holidays to your doc tomorrow. I like this stuff about Insignue, I‚Äôd imagine that the key vibe is these small, self-governing argicultural towns that associate closely with this magic water


[8/8/2023 11:00 PM] rsulfuratus
raises the big question of why did beryl and rai think they could succeed, and why were they wrong? but that is for the level 20 one-shot later on
