Idea for refactoring items, based on thinking about magic items in Taelgar.

1) Magic items are typically created based on using specific semi-magical objects to bind/capture extraplanar energy, typically much easier at an extraplanar weak point. In general, this means that to create a magic item, you generally need to know the formula, in some ways analgous to spells.

2) Magic items have the same power law as spellcasters, so most magic items are common, and very few are exceptionally strong. However, while all artifacts have some kind of story, that doesn't mean a common item can't have a story. 

Separately a mechanical level, there is a reason to make the world conform to some general D&D rules. Most non-legendary, non-artifact magic items in D&D sourcebooks shouldn't be unique mechanically Taelgar, and the lore of magic items should have it make sense that certain items tend to be easy to find.

From this I can think of a few things that are maybe worth thinking about.

1) Some items -- Drankorian Sending Stones; Skaer masterwork weapons; Lakan monastery extradimensional storage -- have "standard" D&D mechanics (mostly) but are in-world part of a specific workshop tradition. These feel interesting and useful to track

So far in my game the basic pattern has been… 

Most items are fairly similar to specific D&D items, but often not in the exact form..

Ie a ring that has the same game effect as a pearl of power (rather than a pearl)

Also, I’ve usually made up some brief history even for “common” magic items, and I haven’t shied away from simple made up items, i.e an amulet with three stones each of which heals

I’ve had a tendency to assume that magic items are very hard to destroy and haven’t thought much about how they come to be


[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right your players haven't asked for custom magic powers on their flying castle yet I presume


[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
By that I mean I thought more about the history


[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
Ie a Drankorian shield that was unearthed or a Sembaran war hammer that was buried with a knight or whatever

Magic items have mostly had a specific “ancient” source in my game so far


[7/7/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
But I think the general ideas you outlined make sense, except I think I’ve leaned into a little bit more creativity and likelihood for group #2


[7/7/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think in that context your magic items are much "cleaner" from an obisidian point of view. if each item has a clear history then it likely deserves its own page (if only for campaign notes type info) and how it was created doesn't necessarily matter.


[7/7/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but you guys have a lot of magic items without a clear history, or just vague notes about who created it (since by default that is the easiest thing to improvise in the mirror if I at least know where and when it was created)

[7/7/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
I think I wouldn’t necessarily assume the D&D rules are exactly the common formulas though. Ie I introduced an amulet with one-time healing abilities which was described as an embodied miracle of the Mother passed down as a family heirloom. I can imagine things like that being common-ish in Sembara


[7/7/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
right, it doesn't have to strictly connect to mechanics or D&D sourcebooks


[7/7/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
But actually thinking about those categories helps refine items. For example
Boots of false tracks are pretty common. Why? Could be fun to make up and then just make a page for the general item
