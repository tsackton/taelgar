Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:10 PM
I am about to go to bed, but I've been messing around with Chardonian history, specifically trying to write a unified narrative that works with the Conclave War, Apporian history, and Mawar History. Here is what I have so far:

#### The Great War and the Blood Years
DR 1540 - DR 1574
Although the [[Great War]] ended in DR 1545, the vast army of [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] and other terrors that [[Cha'mutte]] had amassed did not simply disappear. Over the next 30 years, two major wars were fought across the lands north of Chardon: the [[Conclave War]] and the to be named war against the hobgoblins. 

basic idea: conclave war then in the 1560s a series of expansion of hobgoblins, stopped in 1561 or 1562, but not really peaceful - next 10 years are back and forth along the north chardon coast; but in 1574 some type of armistace line is drawn, splitting (or even leaving the hobgoblins with most of the coast). Perhaps there is another human kingdom involved here (the "yellow 5 kingdom from other maps"?) in the north, pincering the hobgoblins a bit. 

chardon is settling chasa valley here

#### Early Imperial Era
DR 1574 - DR 1597
During mawar renai; hobgoblins are stilla round the malakel entrance, but somewhat hemmed in by something in the north so don't really have a good expansion plan; perhaps even being somewhat decent rulers in a way; chardon growing in the chasa valley but not really an empire just yet

 DR 1597, when the Umbral Covenant launches the Shadow Armada to conquer Chardon, and loses badly - awakening moment - empire is working this is not like the conclave war at all leads to first serious wave of expansion
#### Imperial Expansion
DR 1597 - present
three phases: 
apporia - 1597 - 1610
1650 - 1675 - conquest of hobgoblins; (mindknife war just after this)
1690 - 1710 - chaylte
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:22 PM
there are some significant details in various of my notes in various places, and also some unwritten notes on modern day chardonian empire that may determine how history plays out.
e.g.:

Current magistros, [[Mitus Verina Auratan]].  Comes from a powerful family; his aunt, Seva Auratan, was magistros before him, and her grandfather discovered chalyte in the north making the family super rich. 

Timing:
Seva dies (aged 71), Mitus becomes Magistros: 1746
Mitus born: 1725
Seva becomes Magistros: 1720
Appius dies: 1703
First chalyte mines in north established; Voltara garrison built: 1680s
Seva born: 1675
Seva's grandfather discovers chalyte in north: 1671
Appius Auratan (Seva's grandfather) born: 1620

So, basically, the Auratan family in the mid 1600s is not particularly notable. Appius Auratan, Seva's grandfather, has some magical training (perhaps retired from the mage guard) and is a bit of an adventurer, and makes the discovery of rich chalyte lodes in the mountains near what is now Voltara. Returns to Chardon and with the profits of his first haul starts a mining company.
(the dates don't have to be exactly right)
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:24 PM
That actually lines up with my timeline almost exactly
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:24 PM
yeah
the big unsettled things are the lake valandros area and the yeraad river valley
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:25 PM
Basically I was taking the Mawar and aporia history as canon and trying to figure out how that fits with Chardon
The big thing is that Chardon can’t be a powerful force on Mawar doorstep until the 1650s-1680s
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:28 PM
in my head the current day empire is basically 6 pieces:
Apporia 
Chasa
Yeraad
North Coast
Valandros
Voltara

with an order of:
Chasa -> Apporia -> Valandros -> North Coast -> Voltara (with Yeraad unclear)
but maybe swapping Valandros and North Coast
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:28 PM
I think for the grand scheme of historical eras it doesn’t matter when lake valandros or Yeraad is settled necessarily
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:28 PM
this is when incorporated into chardonian empire
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:29 PM
Or rather incorporated
North coast matters re: Mawar
I don’t think the north coast can be incorporated earlier than 1650s
Without changing the dates of the Mawar renaissance at least
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:30 PM
there is a bit of tension here since my original idea (which you either independently invented or was in notes somewhere) is that it takes chardon a long time to get strong enough to break the hold of hobgoblins on the north coast
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:31 PM
Right that was in your notes
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:31 PM
so that puts mawar renaissance at the same time as "hobgoblin kingdoms to the south"
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:31 PM
Which I think is ok actually
As long as the hobgoblins are hemmed in somehow, not expansionist
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:33 PM
right. mawar is protected by mountains via land, and can easily posulate that mawar is by far the better navy than hobgoblins
actually the hobgoblins maybe get cut off a bit at this stage. still harass chardon to south (and east?) but mawar renaissance reinvigorates the north, e.g. the "remnant yellow kingdoms"
the modern day vibe that is important to keep is that the north coast, chasa, and apporia are all basicaly loyal imperialists and still think of chardon as their saviors
whereas the voltara area does not - chardon is much more of an imperial power here
lake valandros and yeraad being undetermined as i'm not yet clear who actually lives there now
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:37 PM
(AFK fora bit)
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:37 PM
however, voltara has always in the great library game been an isolated frontier with most of the population density actually to the west, basically along the coast in "yellow kingdom 5", which I think is definitely not ever chardonian
(but no details exist about this culture)
(other than the voltara vibe)
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:40 PM
Right but that all fits. Basically the idea is— yellow kingdom 5 survives along the coast during the conclave war - basically as the only survivor of northern non-Drankorian kingdoms.
Then hobgoblins come south, bypassing yellow 5 for whatever reason (and Mawar because of mountains + magic fog)
Between 1556 and 1565 or whatever Chardon fights to major wars (expansionist hobgoblin and conclave), but is exhausted after that
1570s-1590s are basically growth in the Chasa River valley. With hobgoblins still along the north coast but in some kind of holding pattern/stalemate
Maybe a few small skirmishes and reclamation of some territory along the coast
By ~1595 Mawar sees hobgoblins as relatively weak and the Mawar renaissance starts. Chardon also has grown but now and see itself as a strong power for the first time when it crushes the umbral convent
But Mawar and Chardon are still separated by the hobgoblins along the north coast, and kinda growing independentally. Chardon starts a series of expansions
Whatever the exact timing, the expansion towards the north coast is clearly “saving them from hobgoblins” whereas the lake expansion is less clear
And the voltara expansion(last) is clearly for chaylte
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:47 PM
Anyway going to bed. But might mess around tomorrow depending on my workload
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:47 PM
Yeah it seems to all roughly fit nicely on a high level

continued next day
Deciusmus — Today at 3:44 PM
Here's the version I have so far, slightly modified from last night, and trying to leave the right "blank spaces" while still being a solid framework.

Great War and Blood Years
In Chardon this is basically 1545 - 1597 (the defeat of the Umbral Covenant being the conventional "end of the Blood Years") in Chardon at least.

There are a couple of major things happening here:

1548(ish) - 1558(ish): Conclave War. Wipes out all human civilizations north of Lake Valandros and east of the coastal mountains, although it doesn't necessarily kill all the humans. 

1550s - 1560s: Hobgoblin advance. Methodically moves south along the North Chardon Coast.

1545 - 1590ish: Mawar fog/isolation.

1559 - 1584: Apporian pirate kingdoms

1584 - 1597: War of the Dark Rift

post 1560: settlement of Chasa River valley by Chardonians 
By the end of this period, the following things need to be true:
Mawar feels safe enough to dismiss the fog
Chardon starts to become truly imperial, absorbing the Approian provinces in the aftermath of the War of the Dark Rift
The following things should not have happened yet:
Chardon absorbs/conqueors the North Chardon coast, Lake Valandaros, of Voltara
Unclear:
What is happening in the Yeraad river
rsulfuratus — Today at 4:01 PM
I'm pretty busy today but a few quick thoughts
rsulfuratus — Today at 4:09 PM
(1) It is probably useful to sketch out a little more clearly the "state of play" w/r/t hobgoblins in 1545. 

the major concentrations of Cha'mutte's armies are in the Dunmar/Isingue border area, and in Pandar, with scattered concentrations elsewhere. 

a part of the southern armies (Iron Fang) move quickly against Sembara and are defeated in the Bloodlust War

the rest of the southern armies establish on the eastern frontier of Dunmar and are involved in a series of wars from 1550s - 1610

the northern armies are canonically larger and also potentially more desparate, as one must presume that pandar does not have the agricultural capacity to feed a large army without magic. 

the shattered ice clan moves against sembara across the mountains in the 1570s in some notes (timing is around 1st hobgoblin war), but in other notes the shattered ice clan is not involved in the 1st hobgoblin war. there is a semi-canonical idea they were somehow pushed over the mountains by chardonian expansion but i'm not sure the geography works super well.
Deciusmus — Today at 4:09 PM
So I just was reading up on this in various chats/docs
rsulfuratus — Today at 4:10 PM
dated way back the original idea of the "Blood Years" was basically, Cha'mutte is defeated but his armies are not, so this all works well, but the exact movements are a little ambiguous at the moment and fairly important to post-Great War history of the west coast
A related point: where are hobgoblins now?
Which also plays into west coast history
Currently the world vibe in ongoing campaigns has not had major hobgoblin wars as a theme, so they are probably pretty scattered but not likely extinct
Deciusmus — Today at 4:12 PM
The semi-canonical view is:
 Southern army becomes Iron Fang + Bitter Knife 
Iron Fang is defeated quickly by Sembara but only partially, and becomes the mad scientist plagueland hobgoblins (who are still around)
Bitter Knife has a longer series of wars against Dunmar, but is defeated more throughouly
 Northern army splits into 2 branches, the "western north" branch and the "eastern north" branch
Eastern north branch is the key troops of the conclave war. Defeated by Chardon in the 1550s/1560 timeframe they regroup and push west over the mountains into Sembara in the 1570s to be the first hobgoblin war in Sembar
western north tbd
 
rsulfuratus — Today at 4:14 PM
So all three hobgoblin wars are same group on sembara?
Deciusmus — Today at 5:21 PM
and chardon is busy building a road through the Tawir gap instead of helping
along that southern blue road
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:21 PM
right
the exact dates of the mindknife wars could be adjusted slightly, but this should be into chardon's newly expansionist era where it is starting to look to secure chalyte resoruces
Deciusmus — Today at 5:22 PM
right
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:22 PM
it is likely / possible that chardon is fighting some other wars at this point
Deciusmus — Today at 5:23 PM
you mean against the human kingdoms in voltara region?
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:23 PM
possibly. or whatever is there
in the Great Library campaign, there is human settlement south of Voltara, and possibly non-Chardonian cities along the coast
but there is nothing really north of voltara except orcs, hobgoblins, and kobolds
Deciusmus — Today at 5:24 PM
Right; those coastal cities work well as the remains of yellow kingdom 5, and a big tradiing partner with mawar during the renaissance
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:24 PM
the vibe has also been that voltara is a frontier, and that the long road to lake valandros is fairly dangerou
the coastal region is probably not part of the chardonian empire at the moment and is likely a non-drankorian culture
so they need to survive somehow the early hobgoblins
but amani (yellow kingdom 2, on the voltara plains) is completely destroyed
Deciusmus — Today at 5:25 PM
so here is my northern hobgoblin map
Image
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:26 PM
possibly in the non-quite canonical war that chardon doesn't help with
Deciusmus — Today at 5:26 PM
that outlines I think the 4 options to get hobgoblins to the north chardon coast
#1 A - split is far north, head west and sail directly south
#1 B - split is far north, head west, stop on the big island off mawar, then go south
#2 A and B - similar, but not so far north
#3 go from voltara area direct
#4 settle in voltara for a while then go direct
but really we are saying we need, by say 1600:
Image
the red region to have been decimated
the black to be hobgoblins
the yellow to be a recognizeable human culture with connection back to pre-Great War
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:31 PM
Yeah basically with possibly yellow on north coast of lake valansros too
(And with the decimation of elven kingdoms in forests not shown
Deciusmus — Today at 5:31 PM
I think hobgoblins coming by sea really works better
if you have the conclave war hobgoblins basically going like: 
or actually
Image
basically make there be 3 strands:
west
center
east

The center hobgoblins are less enthralled to the dragon Conclave and kinda stop along the way and maybe fight some wars against the humans and settle for a while before being pushed out. But fundamentally Chardon only encounters them as part of the Conclave War (but they are the key enemy in the "unnamed war that destroyed Amini) and also maybe the key group that still exists around the north of voltara/west of fens 
the east hobgoblins are the Conclave true believers and march south
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:35 PM
I was actually going to propose basically that except the center group does not join conclave war
Deciusmus — Today at 5:36 PM
the west hobgoblins come to the north coast from the sea, bypassing whatever human settlements there are on the north coast
right, sure, that works too
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:36 PM
If you have three hobgoblin strands - revenge/conclave, brutal/violent, and conquerors
Then the defeat of the brutal/violent group can potentially be trigger for Mawar renaissance
Deciusmus — Today at 5:38 PM
Image
1  = conqueors
2 = brutal/violent
3 = revenge/conclave
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:40 PM
Right something like that
Deciusmus — Today at 5:42 PM
slight tweak:

(making the conquerers on the southwest shore of lake valandros)
Image
then you have the brutal/violent in the middle and human refugees fleeing in the blue
not sure what makes the brutal hobgoblins go away but you could end up with 2 or 3 human cultures regrouping after they vanish, and looking to Mawar as the main cultural touchstone in the region
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:43 PM
A few other considerations: 
conquerors here would presumably have a strong navy initially, but this has to disappear for Mawar renaissance to make sense
this puts Mawar in a slightly different light, basically abandoning the light blue people
Deciusmus — Today at 5:44 PM
One idea: maybe Mawar drops the fog to lead the fight against the brutal/violent hobgoblins
and are the key people in the coalition that defeats them
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:45 PM
Hmm. Maybe. Also i think the lake valandros hills are a good place for lots of ruins and such so probably that would imply pushing the light blue southwest and the brutal hobgoblins southeast
Deciusmus — Today at 5:46 PM
I'm not sure I like the mawar leading the fighthonestly
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:46 PM
FWIW this is also supposed to be on the shores of lake valandros: https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/mace-of-terror-vision/
But could fit into almost any war
I’m not convinced Mawar leading the fight is the right vibe
Deciusmus — Today at 5:48 PM
yeah me neither
rsulfuratus — Today at 5:51 PM
Two thoughts: nothing has to say Mawar was great allies with the interior northern kingdoms pre Great War. So vibe is maybe less “Mawar abandonded allies” and more “Chardon and Mawar retreated and left the north to fight alone”
Second there is kind of a vibe of “everyone do what they need to survive” which makes Mawar again not exactly a hero but also not unusual
Deciusmus — Today at 6:12 PM
Ok here's a new idea:
Image
basic idea:
three hobgoblin strands as discussed.

#1 - conquest strand. arrives by sea. exact route undetermined but they land on the north coast late 1550s +/-
#2 - death and violence strand. might not be purely hobgoblins, could be orcs? something else? cause of the war which destroyed Amani
#3 - conclave war strand
in the early 1550s the #2 and #3 groups wipe out "Yellow Kingdoms" 2 and 3. (4 was already gone due to original cha'mutte armies)
the #1 strand conqueors most of the post drankorian kingdoms, but has a frozen border with chardon (in south) and active borders with two surviving post-drankor kingdoms in blue
in the 1590s, something happens that wipes #2 off the map, mostly.
this makes the destruction up north a little less wholesale - sure "yk 2 and 3" get wiped out by some terrifying whatever but it isn't exactly like there are these endless hobgoblin wars that mawar is staying out of
Afk for a bit
rsulfuratus — Today at 6:19 PM
i'm home so dumping a few great library notes here
(1) a story told by a bard who lives alone in the mountains north of Voltara (not Chardonian)

Azzan - northlander hero
Ikos - Chardonian friend
Fought together in the Great War against Cha'mutte, great friends. But soon after the war, in the chaos as the hobgoblins poured from the north, Chardon abandoned the Northlanders, seeking to protect their borders. Despite Ikos' pleas, Chardon did not come to their aid and many died. Now, Chardon has come back but in front of an Empire, instead of allies. 

(could be metaphor / retconned)
rsulfuratus — Today at 6:30 PM
(2) handouts from very early in the great library campaign, no need to be canonical
Image
which reminds me, another consideration: there is a big dwarven ruins underneath the mountains separating voltara from the coast, but no dwarves
so these were presumably destroyed during whatever wiped out amani
rsulfuratus — Today at 6:45 PM
here is a rough outline of current west coast vibes
Image
red (D) = ruins of pre-Great War dwarves
red (E) = ruins of pre-Great War elves
pinkish = desolation / orcs / hobgoblins / whatever (no civilizations)
blue = thriving non-Chardonian cultures
green = "core" of Chardonian Empire, mostly quite loyal
light blue = "frontier" of the Chardonian Empire. Voltara very much a garrison town with a fractious local population; lake valandros coast less clear what it is
black = ?????
light purple = Deno'qai
other details:
Chardon's conquest of Voltara is not a war against a strong, organized kingdom. my headcannon has always been kind of like conquering beorinlings or something
it is entirely possible the reason why Voltara feels like a frontier is some of the light blue area is hobgoblins / empty / dangerous; or, some of the light blue area is people who don't like chardon. but it is not densely settled
blue areas are not in active conflict with Chardon; to the extent Chardon has been recently expansionist it is south (to Illoria) and east (into forests / Deno'qai)
history should provide reasons why green areas generally feel loyal and happy (this is already mostly accomplished)
Yeraad really needs some thought
Deciusmus — Today at 7:17 PM
Right so if you take my 1560 map, it maps pretty nicely onto your "current" map
Basically the story goes something like....

On the eve of the Great War you have 
"yellow kingdoms 1 - 5"
mawar
"post drankor kingdoms A, B, C, etc"

in particular you have a bunch of related minor kingdoms (call them A, B, C, D, and E) along the coast, as well as a fairly important post-Drankorian kingdom F in the Nahadi river valley
F is pretty closely aligned with Chardon
then there are one or more scattered frontier provinces along the borders
(Tawir Forest and north shore of lake valandros)
When the Great War + Conclave War comes, yellow kingdoms 3 + 4 are completely wiped out.
as are whatever post-Drankorian realms are up the Chasa River valley (Kin-Asa, etc)
Deciusmus — Today at 7:25 PM
then "something bad" comes out of the cha'mutte army, not the conclave dragons, but something else. Could be a violent bunch of hobgoblins, could be orcs, could be a random mix of stuff. They break "yellow kingdom 2" (Amani) and whatever dwarven kingdom is in the mountains there, to the extent it has survived the great war
this "something bad" is the source of all of the vague rumors in the Great Library game, and it doesn't have to be super canonical exactly what it is
separately, the "conquest" hobgoblins land on the north coast
rsulfuratus — Today at 7:32 PM
right, so i think the basic idea works well
i think the idea of a hobgobin armada conquering the north coast probably needs a bit of magical help, but the basic logic works fine
^specifically because it might take too long for hobgoblins to really settle here otherwise, but maybe not
the basic idea of the area stretching from north valandros coast to voltara is left relatively undeveloped but there is some bad thing here that causes destruction but is eventually defeated
mawar renaissance in this history becomes a bit of a broader northern renaissance, basically a flourishing in the north while chardon is still bearing the brunt of the north coast hobgoblins or something (since the north is safe sooner than chardon is safe)
still some unanswered questions but this seems like a solid framework
Deciusmus — Today at 7:40 PM
right so then in say 1560 or 1575 you have something like this:
Image
the blue "6" is the old post drankor F an largely survives to join chardon - i.e. after the conclave war some type of "mutual defense" alliance becomes a province or whatever. makes this "near Nahadi" a very early part of the empire like the chasa, not sure how that fits with your modern day vibes
rsulfuratus — Today at 7:41 PM
That’s consistent, south valandros is “green”
Ie happy to be part of the empire
Deciusmus — Today at 7:42 PM
the middle two blue kingdoms could in theory just get crushed by the bad things on their borders. or they could survive to form the basis of whatever chardon later conqueors during the voltara conquests. either way, not too many people here really. these are lightly populated "refugee" lands, not proper surviving kingdoms
the north two blue kingdoms (mawar and the other one) form the basis of the northern renaissance
and survive to modern day intact from pre-great war
big unknowns are:
how did so many hobgoblins appear on the coast in late 1550s
what was the big scary in the middle volatara region and what killed it (presumably it going away triggers the Mawar renaissnace/end of mawar hiding)
and to a lesser extent:
who were the "middle blue" kingdoms on the northwest and northeast of valandros, and what happened to them during the northern renaissance? (only real canonical fact is that they can't get wealthy and prosperous enough to be major competitors to chardon in the 1670s/80s when voltara is being conquered)
rsulfuratus — Today at 7:47 PM
right. to a certain extent none of those need to be addressed to write a "grand sweep of history on the west coast" page
there are a few other minor details (who/what lives in Tawir forest?)
but again nothing immediately in need of addressing
Deciusmus — Today at 7:49 PM
agreed
rsulfuratus — Today at 7:49 PM
i think brainstorming yeraad is more critical to getting the final layout of the west coast done in broad strokes than filling the remaiing holes to the north
