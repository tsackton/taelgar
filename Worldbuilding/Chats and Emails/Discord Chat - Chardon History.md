I am about to go to bed, but I've been messing around with Chardonian history, specifically trying to write a unified narrative that works with the Conclave War, Apporian history, and Mawar History. Here is what I have so far:

#### The Great War and the Blood Years
DR 1540 - DR 1574
Although the [[Great War]] ended in DR 1545, the vast army of [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] and other terrors that [[Cha'mutte]] had amassed did not simply disappear. Over the next 30 years, two major wars were fought across the lands north of Chardon: the [[Conclave War]] and the to be named war against the hobgoblins. 

basic idea: conclave war then in the 1560s a series of expansion of hobgoblins, stopped in 1561 or 1562, but not really peaceful - next 10 years are back and forth along the north chardon coast; but in 1574 some type of armistace line is drawn, splitting (or even leaving the hobgoblins with most of the coast). Perhaps there is another human kingdom involved here (the "yellow 5 kingdom from other maps"?) in the north, pincering the hobgoblins a bit. 

chardon is settling chasa valley here

#### Early Imperial Era
DR 1574 - DR 1597
During mawar renai; hobgoblins are stilla round the malakel entrance, but somewhat hemmed in by something in the north so don't really have a good expansion plan; perhaps even being somewhat decent rulers in a way; chardon growing in the chasa valley but not really an empire just yet

 DR 1597, when the Umbral Covenant launches the Shadow Armada to conquer Chardon, and loses badly - awakening moment - empire is working this is not like the conclave war at all leads to first serious wave of expansion
#### Imperial Expansion
DR 1597 - present
three phases: 
apporia - 1597 - 1610
1650 - 1675 - conquest of hobgoblins; (mindknife war just after this)
1690 - 1710 - chaylte

there are some significant details in various of my notes in various places, and also some unwritten notes on modern day chardonian empire that may determine how history plays out.
e.g.:

Current magistros, [[Mitus Verina Auratan]].  Comes from a powerful family; his aunt, Seva Auratan, was magistros before him, and her grandfather discovered chalyte in the north making the family super rich. 

Timing:
Seva dies (aged 71), Mitus becomes Magistros: 1746
Mitus born: 1725
Seva becomes Magistros: 1720
Appius dies: 1703
First chalyte mines in north established; Voltara garrison built: 1680s
Seva born: 1675
Seva's grandfather discovers chalyte in north: 1671
Appius Auratan (Seva's grandfather) born: 1620

So, basically, the Auratan family in the mid 1600s is not particularly notable. Appius Auratan, Seva's grandfather, has some magical training (perhaps retired from the mage guard) and is a bit of an adventurer, and makes the discovery of rich chalyte lodes in the mountains near what is now Voltara. Returns to Chardon and with the profits of his first haul starts a mining company.
(the dates don't have to be exactly right)
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:24 PM
That actually lines up with my timeline almost exactly
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:24 PM
yeah
the big unsettled things are the lake valandros area and the yeraad river valley
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:25 PM
Basically I was taking the Mawar and aporia history as canon and trying to figure out how that fits with Chardon
The big thing is that Chardon can’t be a powerful force on Mawar doorstep until the 1650s-1680s
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:28 PM
in my head the current day empire is basically 6 pieces:
Apporia 
Chasa
Yeraad
North Coast
Valandros
Voltara

with an order of:
Chasa -> Apporia -> Valandros -> North Coast -> Voltara (with Yeraad unclear)
but maybe swapping Valandros and North Coast
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:28 PM
I think for the grand scheme of historical eras it doesn’t matter when lake valandros or Yeraad is settled necessarily
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:28 PM
this is when incorporated into chardonian empire
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:29 PM
Or rather incorporated
North coast matters re: Mawar
I don’t think the north coast can be incorporated earlier than 1650s
Without changing the dates of the Mawar renaissance at least
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:30 PM
there is a bit of tension here since my original idea (which you either independently invented or was in notes somewhere) is that it takes chardon a long time to get strong enough to break the hold of hobgoblins on the north coast
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:31 PM
Right that was in your notes
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:31 PM
so that puts mawar renaissance at the same time as "hobgoblin kingdoms to the south"
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:31 PM
Which I think is ok actually
As long as the hobgoblins are hemmed in somehow, not expansionist
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:33 PM
right. mawar is protected by mountains via land, and can easily posulate that mawar is by far the better navy than hobgoblins
actually the hobgoblins maybe get cut off a bit at this stage. still harass chardon to south (and east?) but mawar renaissance reinvigorates the north, e.g. the "remnant yellow kingdoms"
the modern day vibe that is important to keep is that the north coast, chasa, and apporia are all basicaly loyal imperialists and still think of chardon as their saviors
whereas the voltara area does not - chardon is much more of an imperial power here
lake valandros and yeraad being undetermined as i'm not yet clear who actually lives there now
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:37 PM
(AFK fora bit)
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:37 PM
however, voltara has always in the great library game been an isolated frontier with most of the population density actually to the west, basically along the coast in "yellow kingdom 5", which I think is definitely not ever chardonian
(but no details exist about this culture)
(other than the voltara vibe)
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:40 PM
Right but that all fits. Basically the idea is— yellow kingdom 5 survives along the coast during the conclave war - basically as the only survivor of northern non-Drankorian kingdoms.
Then hobgoblins come south, bypassing yellow 5 for whatever reason (and Mawar because of mountains + magic fog)
Between 1556 and 1565 or whatever Chardon fights to major wars (expansionist hobgoblin and conclave), but is exhausted after that
1570s-1590s are basically growth in the Chasa River valley. With hobgoblins still along the north coast but in some kind of holding pattern/stalemate
Maybe a few small skirmishes and reclamation of some territory along the coast
By ~1595 Mawar sees hobgoblins as relatively weak and the Mawar renaissance starts. Chardon also has grown but now and see itself as a strong power for the first time when it crushes the umbral convent
But Mawar and Chardon are still separated by the hobgoblins along the north coast, and kinda growing independentally. Chardon starts a series of expansions
Whatever the exact timing, the expansion towards the north coast is clearly “saving them from hobgoblins” whereas the lake expansion is less clear
And the voltara expansion(last) is clearly for chaylte

Anyway going to bed. But might mess around tomorrow depending on my workload
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:47 PM
Yeah it seems to all roughly fit nicely on a high level
