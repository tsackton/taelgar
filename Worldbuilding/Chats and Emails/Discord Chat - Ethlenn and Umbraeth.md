what do you think about the following...

Ethlenn has some natural magic - something about her from before the Riving - that lets her draw the Feywild closer to Taelgar. This means she leaves behind portals, sometimes, and can strengthen a weak spot into a permanent portal. In a way, this is why there are so many fey portals in the fey belt - Ethlenn created them.

The fey portal in Cleenseau is ancient, but collapsed, perhaps during the downfall. It became a weak spot but with a lot of odd resonances and "waves" (i'm imagining almost like a part of the fey wild, or of taelgar that is bouncing or moving and sometimes is a true weak spot, othertimes is far away). 

Rarely, this bouncing odditiy of a portal actually opens, which Umbraeth quite likes, because the portals from Duskmire to Taelgar are all mostly not nearby to human (i.e. in the Darkwood or whatever)

Recently, the lich has made a deal with Umbraeth, and given him a stablizing magic item of some kinda, which lets Umbraeth periodically strengthen and stablize the portal, but it isn't a permanent solution for some reason.

Instead, Umbraeth has learned (possibly also from the lich) that Ethlenn has this magic ability to stabilize portals, and if he can get something infused with Ethlenn's magic, he can stabilize the portal forever.


[9/25/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
"Something infused with Ethlenn's magic" is Elaine II, the Queen of Tyrwingha. She is descended from an Oracle of the Riven, Morgaine, who was clearly a bit unusual (she lived to 113), and the royal line of Tyrwingha is somehow infused with Ethlenn's magic, and Elaine's father, Gyles, was born of some kind of fey magic that allowed his mothers (Annabeth and Morgaine, aforementioned) to have a biological child.

All of this makes Umbraeth believe (perhaps accurately) that if he can kill Elaine and take her heart to the feywild, he can make the portal permaent.

On the other hand, if the lich artifact keeping it open at the moment is destroyed on the feywild side, the echoes of the destruction will close the portal forever


[9/25/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps even better is if Umbraeth has learned this independently of the lich; having the lich be defeated and snagging Elaine when she becomes queen of sembara is probably easier for him than getting her in tyrwingha, which would be very hard


[10/3/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
Any chance you had a chance to look at this? Doing some plotting for my next session and wanted to start dropping some hints


[10/4/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
Seems fine to me. Fey portals are supposed to be weird and unpredictable, and there is something similar (not the portal but fey influence leaking over) in the Darkwood, for example


[10/10/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
But at the moment am focused on prep for my game this weekend, plus a lot of work


[10/10/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
I assume you have no objections to the following being canonical:
* Something magical about Ethlenn specifically makes fey gates appear or perhaps just strengthens existing portals
* This magic can, in some fashion, flow towards powerful people under her protection
* Neither of these facts are well understood in Tyrwingha, although presumably the Oracle of the Riven knows them


[10/10/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
no that all seems fine


[10/10/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
although not quite sure what the second bullet point means?


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i also need two more magic items from the dragon hoard if you have any ideas


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
Basically I need a MacGuffin to make it so that Elaine II's heart/body/death in some fashion would strengthen a fey gate


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
(or perhaps sacrifice)


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
ah


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
The exact details of the macguffin don't matter for a while actually.


[10/10/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, certainly it would make sense for people under Ethlenn's protection to have an echo of her magic.


[10/10/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in general fey portals should never, or rarely, be "simple". so far all the ones that exist seem like they require certain conditions to be met in order to activate them. they are way, way, more common than portals to elsewhere (which, generally, are very rare and isolated and require things like going to the heart of an active volcano or a deep trench in the western gulf)


[10/10/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
but that doesn't mean there is a ton of easy traffic between the feywild and the material plane


[10/10/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., lastlight falls is only open for a moment at sunset each day, that kind of thing


[10/10/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
hence why imo the original settlers often marked portals with things like standing stones, to warn people, because maybe if you are wearing the wrong clothing (a necklace made of a certain kind of common flower) you find yourself in the feywild suddenly because the portal is open for you


[10/10/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
so ethlenn, perhaps, is able to stablize these portals in a way to allow her favored people to travel more easily, and this is in some sense the basis of the bargain with the people of tyrwingha


[10/10/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
Secondarily, I kinda like the idea of leaving it undetermined whether or not the fey portal in the woods north of  Cleenseau is closed permanently or kept open permanently. I am presuming my pcs will succeed, but although I have a backup plan to keep Elaine alive if they fail to stop her from being kidnapped, it involves Umbraeth ultimately succeeding in his plan to create a permanent portal. 

The region is irrelevant to Dunmar campaign but it could potentially impact Addermarch game?

[10/10/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
it is far enough away from addermarch probably wont come up for a while


[10/10/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
plus that game is more like an adventure of the week thing at the moment anyway


[10/10/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, my plan for the next 5-10 sessions of my game is basically...

(a) Umbraeth decides to betray the lich (PCs may or may not find out about this)
(b) Lich is killed and news spreads
(c) This is part of Umbraeth's plan, because he wants to bring Elaine to Cleenseau region. He might even be working behind the scenes to encourage a royal tour once she is Queen
(d) He sends minions to kidnap her and bring her to the feywild
(e) My players either - 
1) stop the minions but fail to follow up on clues and go into the feywild to destroy the gate permanently (or go, but fail to successfully destroy the gate). At this point the portal stays unstable, flickering on and off randomly over the years.
2) stop the minions and go into the feywild, and destroy the gate
3) fail to stop the minions (and which point some powerful fey from Twilight's Grace will swap places with Elaine for Reasons), at which point the portal becomes permanent and the heart of the Cleenseau wood starts to become much more fey infested





[10/16/2024 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
looked at the Serenveil stuff a bit, and was thinking a little more last night. 

I like the vibe of Istarias basically being a pawn (at least that is how it reads to me based on your notes), and I like Serenveil as an ally (of sorts, at least) of Ethlenn, but not a vassal. 

I don't yet have any good ideas for what Serenveil's motives are (open to suggestions; presumably the de Brune family cult is deeply involved in whatever this is, although perhaps they have other motivations as well). But I think the dynamic of Serenveil looking to Ethlenn for protection against a stronger bully (Umbraeth) is probably the right vibe and seems consistent with both campaigns so far.


[10/16/2024 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure how much of the Umbraeth / Ethlenn dynamic is really developed or canon, but clearly in the past ~700 years (since the fall of Amberglow), Umbraeth has been grabbing territory, getting more powerful, expanding his domain, and so it is possible that Serenveil is a window into how the kind of unconnected fey feel about this, which might be largely a sense of anger at Umbraeth not necessarily for his original offenses, but for being the one with the big stick on the block. and also potentially could involve some annoyance at Ethlenn for not properly dealing with the problem (which, in their eyes, she created in the first place). especially given that Ethlenn clearly has somewhat unusual motives for an archfey given the Tyrwingha connection, etc


[11/19/2024 7:06 PM] .deciusmus
Would it make sense for Ethlenns ability to pull taelgar and the Feywild closer together and strengthen/make portals to be in some way metaphysically similar to the moon‚Äôs planar tides


[11/19/2024 7:06 PM] .deciusmus
?


[11/19/2024 7:06 PM] .deciusmus
Not suggesting that Ethlenn is anyway related to the moon, but rather than there is some commonality in the metaphysics


[11/19/2024 10:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I think so far I've tended to think of a single divine realm for the each set of Firstborn / Embodied Gods. E.g, dwarves have just the Heart of the Mountain for all the Baharzel.


[11/19/2024 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense


[11/19/2024 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus
re: tides - I think conceptually yes to both some kind of "tide" from Aldanor's realm and some vague metaphysical relationship between the moon's planar tides and Ethlenn's


[11/19/2024 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
but also I think this is very vague - just a sense of there being a kind of tide-like phenonmenon, which is mysterious, but can potentially be controlling various ways and influenced by various powers


[11/19/2024 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but e.g. there could be an interesting lore connection with your lunar sorcerer, for example


[11/19/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that is why I was thinking about it


[11/19/2024 11:08 PM] .deciusmus
Specifically I was thinking that his lunar magic would help/be key in figuring out the basic plot of ‚Äúneeds some part of Ethlenn‚Äôs magic to keep portal open‚Äù


[1/15/2025 9:01‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
right, I missed that


[1/15/2025 9:01‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
that is not canonical


[1/15/2025 9:02‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
the vibe I'm going for is...

She obviously appeared and walked around and was very public about it around the time of Derik I's ascention to the throne and the founding of modern sembara


[1/15/2025 9:03‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
and probably or likely appeared one or two other times in the early blood years but haven't defined that


[1/15/2025 9:04‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
but in the last 100ish years she hasn't announced herself and paraded around Talofwern and held court


[1/15/2025 9:04‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
but it isn't like she is hidden or has not ever appeared to anyone


[1/15/2025 9:04‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
but there are obviously plenty of fey that go back and forth, it isn't like she is hidden _in the feywild_, just doesn't really come to the material plane often


[1/15/2025 9:04‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/15/2025 9:05‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
Yeah, she holds court in Twilight's Grace all the time


[1/15/2025 9:05‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
and is not hidden at all


[1/15/2025 9:05‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
all the fey would have seen her, no problem


[1/15/2025 9:05‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
separately, my impression has always been that -- for reasons undetermined -- she has a small domain with strict borders that she maintains (and is perhaps unusually strong for the size of her domain - not that those necessarily correlate), but her domain has never really shrunk/grown much in a long long time


[1/15/2025 9:06‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
yes definitely


[1/15/2025 9:07‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
what is your take on her role in wider feywild politics. e.g., there is this unknown "bad fey place"  (Sharpspire) in the sentinels that leads to occasional strained cooperation between shimmersong and duskmire


[1/15/2025 9:08‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
what does ethlenn think of that? does she go to the "Archfey parties" so to speak? (probably not real parties - but for example the Chanceweaver had people from Shimmersong at his court)


[1/15/2025 9:08‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
I don't think she ever leaves Twilight's Grace


[1/15/2025 9:09‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
except - rarely and not in a long time - to go to Tyrwingha


[1/15/2025 9:09‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
And I think she is somewhat unconcened with what happens outside her borders, although not *entirely* unconcerned. But I think she is more concerned with what happens in the mortal world than the feywild


[1/15/2025 9:10‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
how about Umbreath? he has obviously expanded some into Amberglow territory, or at least what used to be minor realms associated with Amberglow, and he is at least concerned enough with his western borders to cooperate with Shimmersong


[1/15/2025 9:10‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
There is this idea of the Twilight Court, which is noted as unclear canon, but happy for it to exist if it is a relevant idea, which is imagined as a huge party she throws every 25 years or old, inviting all the powerful fey, that is elegant and fancy


[1/15/2025 9:11‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
Umbreath would totally travel anywhere he is invited; he was originally a master of games and ceremonies and craves glamor


[1/15/2025 9:11‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
i think an interesting vibe for that would be for it to be kind of neutral ground. Ethlenn doesn't do feywild politics, so all the other archfey find her parties a safe place to do their own politicking


[1/15/2025 9:11‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
He is also ambitious and would love to build something to rival Ethlenn's domain


[1/15/2025 9:11‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
yeah, I was envisioning something like that


[1/15/2025 9:12‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
when was the last Twilight Court in your game?


[1/15/2025 9:12‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
or unclear?


[1/15/2025 9:12‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
does it matter?


[1/15/2025 9:12‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
unclear


[1/15/2025 9:12‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
but if you want one in dunmar, grab it


[1/15/2025 9:13‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
doesn't matter and in fact the timing is pretty good


[1/15/2025 9:13‚ÄØPM] rsulfuratus
i would definitely make Twilight Court canon. i think the feywild needs something like that and it is perfect for Ethlenn's vibe


[1/15/2025 9:14‚ÄØPM] .deciusmus
I don't expect it is *exactly* every 25 years; 25 years before 1749 is 1724, which is close enough to my game I could plausibly have one, but also easily enough to say it was in 1718 or 1726 if needed





[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
is there anything canonical about when Umbreath established Duskmire? in the Duskmire note you have in the 600s but is that set in stone? 

i'm dropping a warning stone in the next adventure for my Addermarch campaign that is near a place of easy travel (not quite a portal, but a place where fey can cross to the material plane with less effort)


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to figure out what language the warning signs might be in


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing canonical.


[9/16/2024 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
But it has to be before Cloudspinner was imprisoned


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i was more wondering about pushing it back a bit. 600s would be when Drankor had already established in Addermarch


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
say to 200 or 300


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
For the expansion narrative to work. Could be much older though. Who knows how long Umbraeth was hanging out in the Darkwood


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so by the time Drankorians arrive, the Ethlenn/Umbaeth split has already happened


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that probably works


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realm in the Cleenseau folder has a few hints


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
will take a look


[9/16/2024 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
But something like 250-300 would work fine.


[9/16/2024 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
I think
