in the modern day the area northeast of the chardon road is kobolds / ??? / scrubland / lightly peopled and fine to be ???
but the rest is in need of something clearer to put there
basically, originally this was just "core chardon empire" but that makes the core chardon empire too big in my opinion
in high school is was basically "core chardon"
Image
but the swamps and rivers got moved around and this area got stretched in the current map
so the center of gravity of chardon shifted north
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:01 PM
right
so on the map there are a lot of cities and roads here
but also it feels a bit separated from the coast
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:02 PM
there are really 2 cities. i'd consider anything northwest of the "south chardon hills" to be "core chardon/chasa" not yeraad
i guess 3 cities - one is in the hills
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:03 PM
so from the map I'd guess the denset population is the yellow:
Image
but not sure if that is right
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:04 PM
yeah i think that is close. the coast is imaged to be swampy with a big delta
not sure how far it extends so maybe some settlement around the mountains on the coast
most of the mountains are imagined to closely approach the ocean so you get cliffs and not a lot of settlement. and also maybe  giants or something that keep people from venturing too much
in any case for whatever reason those mountains are supposed to be pretty uninhabited
but you definitely have people on the north slopes
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:05 PM
I think it is useful for the yeraad to be culturally pretty disconnected from the nevos
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:06 PM
the mouth of the yeraad i've always imagined kind of like the mississipi delta
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:07 PM
right
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:07 PM
it's about 3 degrees further north
and somewhat drier overall
but not too different
the interior is maybe a bit like texas hill country
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:07 PM
but you could imagine it as pretty heavily populated with lizardfolk
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:07 PM
yes
if anyone lives between delta and mountains it is probably small illorian colonies, that type of thing. and the area with the windmill on the map is basically "core chardon", if undeveloped in detail
so it is really the interior area south of river, north of moutains, along the road connecting the two major cities that needs development
and this feels like it should have a pretty different culture / vibe than core chardon
but what is not clear,  nor is how they came to be chardonian
the one city is kind of placed as a mining town, although chardon mostly gets metals from lake valanadros hills, which are closer and have river transport
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:12 PM
so you have something like this:
Image
where pink is illorian
red is danger/no people
blue is lizardfolk
yellow is core chardon
green is "yeraad river"
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:13 PM
yeah. maybe curving up a bit between the major swamps on the yeraad, but the basic outline is correct
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:15 PM
So from a historical perspective, this would have been ?? -> drankorian -> some kind of post-drankor state -> relatively safe in great war / blood years -> somehow part of chardon
in the ?? period it would have been largely on the drankorian borderlands for a fairly long time
although perhaps not meaningfully so if the songra area was unpeopled and drankor was focused on the nevos sea/darba
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:16 PM
right. at one point i had the idea that somewhat whatever was here actually triggered the western wars somehow. e.g. maybe got taken over by something evil or ???
but darba was a bigger border and songara wasn't founded
so maybe not a super dense or high traffic border
the myraeni gap is a natural barrier
so there would be contact but maybe not a lot of contact
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:20 PM
It feels like a good place for a kinda insular culture. Happy to have a sovereign overlord but kinda do their own thing
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:20 PM
right. its also fairly big (300 miles by 200 miles, roughly) and doesn't need to be just one thing
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:21 PM
Right
What’s the climate like?
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:23 PM
the myraeni gap is very much texas hill country
but the rest of the valley is probably not quite that dry
i could see the wedge between the two eastern tributaries as being pretty much texas hill country
the northeast part along the elderwood is clearly wetter and is maybe the most densely populated
the whole area is marked Csa
Chardon is supposed to have a kind of san francisco climate vibe
spain and greece and parts of italy also work
the summer high pressure shifts over the yeraad to allows the monsoons, so this is definitely a dry summer, wet winter area
but warm enough for year round growing - basically california
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:30 PM
Right. But with slightly different mountain structure.
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:31 PM
Right running perpendicular instead of parallel to coast
I’m kind of thinking the right vibe might actually several small fragmented cultures without much cultural or political cohesion
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:32 PM
Yeah I was kinda thinking the same
If you play with the geographic a little bit you could have 3-4 pretty separate regions, ie maybe the land between the two rivers is kinda higher and you have a cattle culture in the hill lands between the rivers
Then the section north of the yeraad along south of the hills is wetter and more agricultural
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:37 PM
Image
something like:
(1) agricultural, maybe olive growing
(2) dry rocky hills, cattle ranching
(3) ?? - highlands? not sure, imaging the eastern river here is rapid and non-navigable
(4) river valley culture
but the exact borders could shift a bit
with 1 and northern part of 2 densest settlement
alternatively 3 could be perfectly logical place for non-humans
although who is not clear
i think:
(2) is dusty roads, and only nominally controlled by chardon. basically, they staff forts along the roads. maybe charge tribute in the form of some kind of tax. but culturally this really isn't chardonian
and culturally may be distinct from 1/3/4 too
this could be "myraeni" / a more pure "original northerner" culture
although probably worshipping mos numena
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:43 PM
Yeah I like that. Maybe the tax is more of a “protection” thing as well, ie the northern borders are not that safe
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:43 PM
right, sure
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:44 PM
So kinda a happy to pay situation because Chardons a pretty competent overlord and is not that interested in forcing local politics to change
So the legions and such are pretty welcomed ie when they are marching to Dunmar
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:45 PM
right. canonically there was a lot of trouble with kobold raiders here
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:45 PM
Not really questioned or a problem. Maybe lots of poorer folks here join the army even
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:46 PM
and actually the vibe was always "chardon doesn't pay enough attention to our problems"
i think (1) is likely fairly well integrated into chardon. this maybe has a similar story to Raziolo, the further west province in apporia
but culturally maybe distinct from (2). perhaps more drankorian, perhaps more culturally chardonian. maybe a substantial population of refugees from chasa river from conclave war who fled and never returned (Kin-Aska was completely destroyed, for example)
probably don't need much detail here, although eventually want names and more history, for the broad sweep post-Great War these are integrated peacefully during the period of consolidation and expansion between 1600 - 1640 roughly
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:50 PM
Wouldn’t refugees just flee toward Chardon?
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:50 PM
the conclave armies got within ~50 miles of chardon
(1) is both ~75 miles closer to Kin-Aska and crucially south of the path of the invading army, which is clearly heading to chardon
but the details don't really matter
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:52 PM
Right
Either way the main idea would be that yeraad is a somewhat culturally unique area largely supportive of Chardonian rule but not really Chardonian culturally
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:55 PM
well, i would say (1) and (2) on my map, yes. (3) and (4) maybe not
i kind of wonder if there is another chalyte source in the south mountains and that is the purpose of the city in (3)
although would have to have problems for some reason or it wouldn't be worthwhile to go all the way north to voltara
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:57 PM
What if there are giants
Who don’t really want Chardon to take the chaylte
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 8:59 PM
sure, that could work. i'm not totally ready to commit to a specific idea especially involving chalyte as this may be quite relevant to the coming chardonian upheavals
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 8:59 PM
Right.
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:00 PM
but i think the basic vibe of (3) being "something that is complicated by some complicated factor potentially involving giants or something" is sensible
this area probably was conquered during the later expansionist phase for ~reasons~
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:00 PM
Right. Doesn’t even have to be chaylte
Could also be an area that was mysteriously empty after the Great War.
Say, no one really knows what happened to the people.
I dunno. The vibes work
The details don’t really matter
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:03 PM
Right
Then maybe 4 is just lightly populated? I’m not sure the (4) vibes
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:05 PM
I think the lizardfolk have something to do with (4) vibes
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:06 PM
Yeah that seems right
Maybe that region is not even part of the chardonian empire
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:10 PM
Yeah actually that’s intent
Interesting
(3) has not a lot of people but something Chardon wants. Which motivates the peaceful absorption of (1) and (2) and least in part
(3) doesn’t go well for ~reasons~ so it becomes kind of a lightly settled borderland, but plenty of people moved there or whatever so it isn’t empty
But (1) and especially (2) are the places with long interesting histories
Then there is something in 4, in between the red danger separating it from the coast and the oddities of (3), but it’s intentionally blank for now. But not part of Chardon and maybe not even drankoiran
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:19 PM
(4) might have an interesting history, just an insular one
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:19 PM
Right
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:36 PM
Ok I’m going to try to write up some of the non-yeraad stuff over tomorrow/Friday/Saturday
Basic canonical points:
hobgoblins by sea to north Chardon
“bad thing” central attack on voltara
conclave war
end of bad thing is start of Mawar renaissance

Non-canonical:
what the bad thing was and how it ended
what happened to the hobgoblins on north Chardon as they were defeated
Canonical:
some kind of south valandros kingdom that is absorbed into Chardon
north east and north west valandros lightly populated
non drankorian realm on north bay coast
Non canocial:
any details of the middle and north places (might make up some details on the place that is now part of Chardon heartland)
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:40 PM
[]
yeah, sounds reasonable. i may have some more comments / thoughts when it is all written out but am trying to finish the cosmology project asap so i can push a new taelgarverse saturday, and need to switch to session prep, so might not have time to do much more of this for a bit
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 9:42 PM
Sure
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 9:53 PM
i pushed my chasa river valley notes from onenote to brainstorming. mostly you didn't spend any time in cities so much of this kind of passed in a blur in the background and doesn't need to be strictly canonical
but generally speaking should be without good reason to deviate
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:08 PM
A couple of name ideas 
Veneros
Tarquina
Valandria (intentionally similar to Valandros)
Nemora (or Nemoris)
Vescarum
Marcenium
Oscandria
Yeraetium
Vastarno
Neracium
Lupentia
If you get a chance to flag any you particularly like/don’t let me know. I’ll tag everything name check anyway
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:19 PM
These are towns/cities? I haven’t settled on solid naming conventions around Chardon. I think generally “Roman-ish” is fine although I’ve often trended more Italian in places (eg apporia). Lots of places in the north would potentially be akin to latinized Arabic or other Semitic names
I forget what I used for kin-aska, I may have been thinking kind of Deno’qai northern
Rivers have tended to be Semitic / Northros, but not always
Voltara area naming is a mess and mostly not canonical but tends Italian which I’m not sure is correct
Volganis and Amani are based on high school names so no linguistic derivation
That said, I like Nemoris, Tarquina, Oscandria. Could be lots of Valandros-related names, plausibly, but generallly for old drankorian things
Lupentia is good too
Don’t really like Veneros
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:28 PM
These are mostly for provinces or other regions. Probably not rivers
Possibly for sites of battles or whatever
Primarily post-Drankorian not up north stuff
What about 
Mizranis
Rafida
Darajum 
Kasira
Badirum
Qamira
Wassid or Wassidi

As river names?
rsulfuratus — Yesterday at 10:37 PM
I like Rafida and Qamira, which I would probably “chardonize” to Kamir or something
I think there is also nothing wrong with a few “Green River” or “Rushing River” type names
Deciusmus — Yesterday at 10:41 PM
For the north coast region in general…

Lirae Verdinum 
Litus Aureum
Caledria

Arabic/northros
Bahrica
Yasir 
Rimila
Not sure I like any of them
Alternatively something like 
The Green Coast
The Fertile Coast
The Gold Coast
Anyway going to bed
