A few disjointed thoughts on your Northern Religions….  
  
What struck me is that it raises a lot of questions about how gods grow and shrink and the metaphysics of gods.  
  
It seems like Taelgarian gods are in a weird space where the metaphysics and the specific idea of “human belief creates gods” is defined enough to feel like new religious traditions need to “fit” and have a justification but loosely defined enough to make it feel both open to many possibilities and also challenging to answer all the questions.  
  
One option would be to define a more rigorous set of rules — but I kinda think it would be better to just make it all vaguer and mysterious. Sure, humans create the divine, but not in any simple way. A god with twice the worshippers isn’t necessarily twice as powerful, and some gods maybe have lots of worshippers but never grow, and other times a god mostly gains worshippers after they have come to some level of power. Perhaps once belief creates the first divine spark, what happens to the god is as much about the nature of the spark and the desires of the god themselves.  
  
So all the reason the tanshi and kestavo never grow into pantheons is because they themselves don’t want to. The kestavo say on Taelgar because that is their home. And the tanshi perhaps inhabit a collaborative realm that many of them create together, where they come and go as they are summoned via the sacrifices.  
  
And perhaps in the western tradition, the gods themselves where enamored of Mos Numena along with their people. And so they became demigods and servants. Could also make an interesting cultural mashup where the gods are converted to the incoming religion as well as the people. You could imagine some small god “switching” the place they interceded to one of Mos Numena instead of Ahra/Malik.

============

If you haven't, you should read Anne Lecke's The Raven's Tower, which was very influential in my thinking about Taelgar gods. I completely agree, though, that having things vague and mysterious is the way to go, and not every god will want to grow in power. I think there can also be other ways to grow beyond just "getting more powerful" whatever that means, and divine power is kind of a nebulous concept anyway given that even the most powerful gods have very limited ability to actually intercede in the material plane. 

Although I can imagine something like the smaller gods can only support a limited number of high level (9th+) clerics, whereas the Eight Divines can support as many as have that potential -- so when Drankor comes conquering with five clerics of 11th level and higher that would seem like a shocking display of divine power to many of the "small gods" traditions who could never imagine a god could sustain such intensity of divine magic in so many people. 

Not entirely intentionally (but I like the implications), I've ended up with something like a continuum where the more powerful the god is, the less "personality" they have. So some divine beings may like who they are and not want to be subsumed so much into the Arha/Malik borgmind that is the "Divine Essence''.
