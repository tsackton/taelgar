Do you have a brief history of the post-Great War? There is lots of stuff in the Sembara and Dunmar docs, but nothing that ties everything together that I have access to at least.

  

Looking for an interesting world event in 1710(ish) to connect Wazir's backstory to. Would be happy to make something up but if so, looking for a little bit of context.

  

But maybe this part of the world is a blank slate?

===============

I don't have a unified timeline, although it is something I eventually intend to make. Even so west of the mountains is largely a blank slate. 

  

Roughly speaking there was a lot of early hobgoblin wars, in the ~30 years after the Great War, but a lot of the recurrence of "hobgoblin trouble" in Dunmar and Sembara around 1575-1610 is due to Chardon crushing the hobgoblin threat in the west b/w 1545-1575, driving the survivors east and south and into the mountains. This was a series of defeats between 1545 and 1560, more or less, and then a series of counterattacks that broke the hobgoblin front line in the 1560s and early 1570s. 

  

So after about 1575/1580 in the west, the huge Cha'mutte armies are defeated and rebuiding begins. The land is almost entirely depopulated, with only a few isolated Northern settlements surviving (e.g. Mawar on the peninsula, and nomadic northerners in the wilds on the western slopes of the mountains, and probably others not yet made up). And there are probably tons of random monsters, isolated hobgoblin settlements, orcs, who knows what else that have basically just destroyed everything. So reconquest is slow, and I imagine goes in fits and starts depending on the fortunes of Chardon itself and the threat level, etc. 

  

By 1748 it has gotten as far north as Voltara, which is only slightly north of the Mawakel peninsula, but the Voltara area is definitely frontier feeling in many ways (and Voltara itself is largely significant as it is a source of chalyte mines), and probably has only been settled for 30 years, maybe a bit more. 

  

Other than that, I don't really have a vision for how Chardon turned from a city-state to an empire, and how the west changed over the 200 years since Cha'mutte. I think that conflict with northerners should be relatively recent, and for most of the Chardonian expansion it involved freeing land from various hobgoblin fiefs, monstrous domains, or just resettled empty land after it was cleared of manticores or whatever. Lots of ruins, lots of refugee movements and kind of a wild west without the colonization feel (until recently, when Chardon is coming into more conflict with the northern cultures). But there could be a lot of flexibility in that. 

  

But in short, yes, you'll need to make something up for the 1710s. The little history I have made up in this area for the Great Library campaign is really all just after the Great War stuff, or at least in the first 50 years or so, so really only up to 1600ish.


===============

How is this for a brief history of the Mawakel peninsula over the last couple hundred years? Some of it I like more than other parts.

  

**The Great War and Aftermath**

The Mawakel peninsula was always a lightly populated and insular place. Largely cut-off from the rest of the continent by the ~EntranceMountain~, the Great War was not the full-blown decimation that it was for many other northern settlements. However, even amongst the Mawar, the time of the Great War was one of danger. Orcs and hobgoblins pushed across the mountains, and the occasional flotilla threatened the eastern settlements. In light of these dangers, a grand conclave was called between the Mawar and the salt lizardfolk, who, through the gaetza ceremonies, had a foretelling of further danger to come. At the conclave, it was agreed to undertake a great magic to hide the land, as much as it could be hidden. Working together, the druids of coast and wood, the salt lizardfolk, and many others found a way to summon a great fog. Although it came at great cost, and required endless vigilance along the borders, the weather, for much of the next twenty years, was made to protect the peninsula. In addition to the weather, for reasons unknown, few dangers ever made it, by sea, from the east to the west side of the peninsula. Rumors abounded of leviathans and other great creatures of the deep hunting for interlopers in the waters of the western shore, and few dared sail more than a few miles from the coast.

  

This was a time of endless foggy mists, and dangers as fishing boats were lost, and even with the fogs, some orcs and whatnot made it into the hills. The interior of the peninsula suffered the most -- between the endless grey, and the dangers that did penetrate -- and few of the small communities nestled amongst the pine forests emerged from this time intact. 

  

By 1560, as rumors of Chardon's success grew, the mists gradually were allowed to disburse, and a baby boom occurred. 

  

**The Post War Generation**

  

The next forty years in Mawar were a time of prosperity and growth. The stagnating population began to grow significantly, and traditions and habits from the time before the war were revived. Little trade came from outside, and patrolling the border was vital. Around this time is when the tradition of the Ocean Watchers started, and many of the towers dotting the coasts were built in the 1580s. But few ships came from anywhere, and the fish was plentiful, and bears and beaver and moose came back into the interior woods, and the hunting was good. In many ways this was a golden era, although it was not unheard of for a band of orcs or worse to be spotting in the hills, or a ship of skeletons to come from the far north. The eastern side of the peninsula bore the brunt of these dangers, and during these years was when the fortunes of the east and west started to diverge.

  

**Chardonian Rediscovery and the Century of Reconnection** 

**[not sure how I feel about this part]**

By 1600, Chardon had grown powerful enough that ships began to sail the Endless Ocean, and in 1604 the first Chardonian exploration in three generations arrived in Mawar. The next hundred years were a time of reconnection. The western port cities grew larger as trade with Chardon and other northern cultures emerging from their devastation brought prosperity and possibility. But this growing reconnection with the rest of the world was not an unadulterated good thing. The growing wealth heightened the class divisions within Mawar, and the rumors throughout the north of this place that seemed to have survived the Blood Years unscathed led to a slow but steady trickle of refugees and immigrants from other northern cultures. Isolationist factions within Mawar, especially amongst the poorer eastern settlements, grew, and political tensions increased.

  

**The Endless Winter**

In the summer of 1708, deep in the pine forests at the headwaters of the Sulqat River, a strange group of refugees from Chardonian conquests of the north established a lair: three sorcerers of unknown age or race, and a huge white dragon. Whatever their goals or experiments, by fall, the river had frozen for much of its length, and the salmon fisheries were devastated. By spring, when the river did not thaw, an expedition was sent, but it did not return. Strange chills were felt all over the peninsula, and the weather remained frigid into August. By then, amongst fears of frozen harbors, and famine, and with the guidance of warnings told to the lizardfolk by the dead of the first expedition, and larger force was sent. Deep in the woods, they encountered a group of Chardonian heroes, hunting across the land for an ensorcelled dragon. Joining forces with the Chardonians, the Mawar expedition defeated the dragon.

  

  

**Wazir's History**

I haven't fully sketched this out, but the Endless Winter episode I came up with as how Wazir learned magic and how he ended up in Chardon. He was on the second expedition, as teenager, and became starstruck by the Chardonians and basically followed them to Chardon.

======
I really like the beginning and end (the Great War and Aftermath, and the Endless Winter).

  

I think I would adjust the timing a bit. I would exent the foggy mists and the like for maybe up to 40 years, until something like 1580/1590. I think something like 1558 or so is the further hobgoblin advance (plus probably other evil stuff), and then the front stabilizes and a few big victories in the early 1560s give Chardon momentum, but for a while it is a series of cross-border raids, local uprisings, probably various heros overthrowing hobgoblin overlords, things like that. There is little political order and few people, and probably a few pockets of stranger stuff, whether remnants of Cha'mutte's armies or something else. Chardon focuses on stability and internal growth to start. 

  

I think the Mawar Renaissance would be something like 1590 - 1640, and I wouldn't necessarily have it be a period quite as isolated as you write it. There is probably some Chardon trade, but Chardon is not expansionist at this point and it is merchants, not armies, that come north. The Mawar still control a lot of the trade routes along the Great Bay area; probably for example chalyte from the north and east is traded to Mawar cities, and then south to Chardon. I think that once the mists fall, it is hard to imagine that some curious Chardonians wouldn't sail there relatively soon, since Chardon also doesn't really suffer during the Great War and is never conquered. I like the idea of a Mawar Revival period, but I'm not sure it makes sense to have it be pre-reconnnection with Chardon. 

  

Chardon turns expansionist in the early 1700s, driven by many things, so this still leaves the question of what happens from 1640 - 1715 or so. Maybe it is a century of Mawar Revival? 

  

There should probably be some other attacks / wars with things that aren't hobgoblins in there. Cha'mutte's armies basically were let loose on the northwest, and there must have been some weird and bad stuff in there. Maybe an aboleth kingdom arises in the north and attacks Mawar, or an army of fiends marches (although this is actually probably what wiped out so many of the elves), or dragons, or almost anything really. This sort of thing could end the Mawar Revival (or put it on hold) without forcing Chardonian expansion earlier than I want it. 

  

More later.

What about something like, in rough terms:

  

* Great War and Aftermaths is like 1545 - 1600. The mists and magical protections are allowed to fade say 1585 - 1590 and it takes about a decade from the fall of the mists until people start to feel 'normal' again. The latter half of the period is probably worse in terms of strange things penetrating the mists.  

  

* Mawar Renaissance, say 1600 - 1675. ~4 generations of the "golden age of Mawar". Some chroniclers would date this from the first (re)contact with Chardon, in 1594. Lots could be said about this period, but not going to try to make it all up now. This would be the height of the "classical" Mawar culture and a lot of "traditionalist" in the modern period would harken back to this time. Ocean watchers and towers are built during this time, and perhaps it is when a lot of the guild halls were built, and so on. Whether it is luck, or Chardon's actions, or the lingering effects of the mists, very few 'big bad' things come into the Mawalek during this period. Perhaps everything is focused southward, trying to beat Chardon. Or perhaps it really is just luck, or perhaps some kind of secret supernatural blessing. 

  

* <Bad Thing 1>, 1675 - 1685. Something bad is loose in the north, and Mawar bears the brunt of it. An aboleth kingdom sounds kinda interesting. This scars a generation and ends the renaissance (ala WW1 and the gilded age of Europe)

  

* Retrenchment, 1685 - 1745. Mawar recovers from the bad stuff, but by now, Chardon has spread north, and is a competitor for trade, resources, trading partners. Trade routes move inland, bypassing Mawar. Other northerns align with (or against) Chardon, and Mawar is much more on the sidelines of history. Some people prefer this, but others long for the olden days when it seemed like Mawar was the center of the northlands. This period also sees increasing unrest in the north, and Mawar is forced to defend itself a lot more than during the renaissance. Between Chardon encroaching to the south and various dangers, it leads to a culture that feels more beset by foreign problems.

This seems great. I'll add to the Mawakel peninsula doc. I may spend a bit of time fleshing out a bit more Chardon history before Thursday to make sure the dates all work out, but generally I think this is great.
