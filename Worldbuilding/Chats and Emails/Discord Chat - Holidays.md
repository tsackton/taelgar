Can you send the chat gpt link over discord or email? Being a non mac user I cant see imessage on my computer


[8/8/2023 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
But in general I think the idea is great, my only thought would be to emphasize the local miracle holidays as well, i.e. if there are 4 holidays on the calendar they shouldn't all be these "generic domain" holidays


[8/8/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
And I also wouldn't worry about balance or precision, i.e. there is no reason why there has to be one "generic" holiday for each divine, I suspect that these "generic" holidays would probably mostly be quite ancient and harken back to Drankor or even H'kar, although people wouldn't necessarily know that


[8/8/2023 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
And not ever ancient holiday from Drankor surived. But the domain holidays would tend to be the ones that *everyone* celebrated in some fashion across the wide set of Mos Numena traditions.

[8/8/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
agree about not needing balance. I only make up holidays for background for current events in the campaign so all I care about now is a winter holiday in Tollen


[8/8/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
On holidays, I really liked the basic idea for Twilight Revelry, Travelers Vigil, and Benevlonet Shaows


[8/8/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
I'm quite interested in the holidays topic because my game is currently mid-Nov, and the next session is going to be a minor events/roleplaying/downtime that time skips through the winter


[8/8/2023 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm working on Twilight Revelry now - basic idea is that in Drankor this was the "day between the years" when everything is upended, people party, and social norms are cast aside, kind of like Saturnalia + Carnivale. Key thing being masks, parades, feasting, probably riddle contests/games of chance


[8/8/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
So having a holiday or two to provide some focus would be perfect


[8/8/2023 5:46 PM] rsulfuratus
in Sembara/Tollen celebrated on Dec 31st.


[8/8/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
I think having 4 major winter holidays doesn't feel right, so I want to use twlight relvery + 1 more at most

{Reactions}
üëç

[8/8/2023 5:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Traveler's Vigil, Benevolent Shadows also great - wouldn't necessarily bunch everything up though


[8/8/2023 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
benevolent shadows idea doesn't need any reason to be winter-associated


[8/8/2023 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
could have traveler's vigil and twilight revelry as major "universal-ish" winter holidays


[8/8/2023 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
No, although traveler's vigil doesn't either, although just for metagame reasons I like it better (one of my PCs is a paladin of the wanderer so I think he'd appreciate that holiday a bit more)


[8/8/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
What is traveler's vigil wasn't the solistce but the last full moon before the solistce or something like that. Would space it out a bit more from Twilight and also potentially leave open the solistice


[8/8/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
In the real world, holidays do sometimes bunch up -- think Rosh Hashanah / Yom Kippur / Sukkot


[8/8/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
So I could imagine, say, Vigil is moon-aspected (full or new) and in winter, but before the solstice. The solstice is not a big deal in Mos Numena, but some highland kingdoms might celebrate a kestavo-inspired type thing, and then twilight relevery comes at new years


[8/8/2023 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I like that


[8/8/2023 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
Mos Numena originally founded in tropical/subtropical area


[8/8/2023 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
So solstice maybe not a big deal in drankor particularly


[8/8/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
Right, winter solistce not a big deal in Drankor/H'kar --


[8/8/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
actually having Traveler's Vigil on the last new moon of the year would be perfect for the timing of my game


[8/8/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
The current date is Dec 4th and in 1719 the last new moon is Dec 6th


[8/8/2023 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
last full moon in 1719 is Dec 20th, so actually that works as well


[8/8/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I think makes more sense as full moon


[8/8/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
But doesn‚Äôt really matter


[8/8/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
In Sembara (and probably Tollen, and other places where winter weather is bad for travel) I was thinking it would be a bit of a marking point in the year -- it is unluckly for travelers to not be home by then, unless they were not coming home for the winter at all, in which case it would be a tradition to send them prayers. So a bit of a combination of celebration of homecoming and prayers for those not at all


[8/8/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
not at home


[8/8/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
The other idea would be to make it an auspicious time to begin a journey and move it to the summer or spring


[8/8/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
Thinking about it more, I don't love the vibe of "tell us about your travels" as opposed to having an association with actual travel. ALthough hospitality is part of the wanderer as well


[8/8/2023 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe the drankorian year actually ended on the solstice, and the days between the solstice and the new year were associated with magic and ritual and ended with the twilight revelry. Travelers Festival was the last holiday of the year and even back then had the same connotations, not because of weather but for mystical reasons


[8/8/2023 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
But I also like association with beginning journeys


[8/8/2023 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
So a couple of ideas:

* Spring time festival, mostly about being a time to start a journey / change in life / etc
* Winter time, a time of homecoming
* Winter time, with an association of both homecoming and hospitality -- so both a celebration for the returning travelers and a celebration of welcoming and hospitality and community, with some wassailing/giving food/etc connotations


[8/8/2023 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Or it could have been an auspicious time to start journeys in drankor but now has a different vibe


[8/8/2023 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
I think any of them could work, #2 feels like it makes it more minor, #3 feels like it would be big, which might overshadow twlight thingy, which might not be what you want


[8/8/2023 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I think 3 makes sense. It would have a bit of Christmas / new years vibe but I think that‚Äôs fine


[8/8/2023 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Having holidays cluster makes them feel more real imo,


[8/8/2023 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[8/8/2023 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
I suspect I'm going to get carried away and decide to write up both these holidays as each of my players would have experienced them, mostly for fun.
In Tyrwingha, in a fey tinged village dedicated to the Wyrdling
In Tyrwingha, in a small market town decided to <undecided divine>
In Embry
In the highland kingdoms, as a dwarf traveler would experience them

I doubt it will be tonight but I have some ideas. Send me whatever you make up so I can fit it in


[8/8/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I‚Äôll send a doc tonight with some unites thoughts


[8/8/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
*initial


[8/8/2023 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Plus of course I need to decide how it would be celebrated in Cleenseau, which is dedicated to the warlord but unusually has a strong secondary wanderer vibe due to some ancient traveler/inn shrines that are still used


[8/8/2023 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
The Insingue community should have its own ritual on travelers night in remebrance of the travelers who are lost (maybe?) but feels like an opportunity for something unique


[8/8/2023 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
would it mess up the timing of your game to have the traveler thing as the first full moon in the new year, instead of the first full moon before the solistice?


[8/8/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
No, doesn‚Äôt matter much


[8/8/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that could make an interesting historical point, where in drankor mirthblaze/twilight revelry/whatever was the ending point of the year and then early january is the new beginning


[8/8/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
and in the south  january would be a good time for new journeys, etc


[8/8/2023 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
but not sure


[8/8/2023 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
That changes the holiday to more of a leave-taking rather than home coming


[8/8/2023 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i am wondering if it is interesting to develop it as a holiday with ancient leave-taking roots but which has acquired new meaning in the Greater Sembaran tradition


[8/8/2023 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps leaving open the idea that it has a very different flavor in Chardon


[8/8/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was wondering about 2 festivals or holy days of the traveler, on in early Dec and one in early Feb. the first was the historical ‚Äúhome coming‚Äù the second the historical ‚Äúleave taking‚Äù


[8/8/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that could work


[8/8/2023 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
With Drankorian roots having a bit of a ‚Äúyou are supposed to be home between Dec and Feb‚Äù vibe


[8/8/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that


[8/8/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
then perhaps the early Dec homecoming could be the one that has diverged a bit among traditions and perhaps merged a bit with northern/kestavo solistice celebrations


[8/8/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
and the feb one is more universal


[8/8/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
But actually I kinda like the idea of the ancient Drankorian festival of departure and leave-taking in early Jan changing significantly in the north to a different vibe, as leaving home in Jan doesn‚Äôt make sense


[8/8/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
Ie either idea could work pretty well


[8/8/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so from a meta perspective I think the extent to which you want to play around with kestavo solistic traditions might be the determining factor


[8/8/2023 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
in a Dec homecoming + Feb leavetaking,  the Dec homecoming is the opportunity to borrow from Kestavo stuff, but there probably isn't space for a separate Kestavo solstice holiday


[8/8/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm more interested in playing around with fey-adjacent traditions in Tyrwingha


[8/8/2023 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
But I don‚Äôt think it has to be solstice per se, and in fact in Tyrwingha there might be a whole different situation related to Ethlenn


[8/8/2023 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
I am also not sure the Mos Numena holidays matter there as much


[8/8/2023 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
And I‚Äôm not sure solstice matters there.


[8/8/2023 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
In the Cleenseau game I don‚Äôt think it would immediately come up


[8/8/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
putting the homecoming celebration at the first full moon before the solistic would put it on Nov 28 in 1748, which is convenient for the meta-reason of not having a major holiday happening while you were in Tollen and not mentioned (although this isn't a major issue IMO)


[8/8/2023 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
I gotta check 1719, I am not at my computer but I think the full moon was like Dec 19. I don‚Äôt want my players to have missed it, current date is Dec 4


[8/8/2023 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Dec 20 in 1719


[8/8/2023 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
It also doesn‚Äôt have to be lunar - drankor / mos Numena is not necessary a particularly lunar religion


[8/8/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
But I think this all works nicely. In Drankor, there were three big holidays, in the winter.  The ‚Äútraveler homecoming‚Äù in late Nov/early Dec, then the wyrdling reveal in new years, then the ‚Äútraveler leavetaking‚Äù in Feb.


[8/8/2023 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
The last might have been more minor,  but in Drankor the time between the two traveler holidays was seen as mystically important to not travel


[8/8/2023 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
Or whatever that connotation might have been lost.


[8/8/2023 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
In the kestavo tradition there probably is/was a solstice festival but it isn‚Äôt much alive in sembara,  but some northern kingdoms might still honor the solstice. But most people would not really celebrate it except as some traditions merging with the dec holiday


[8/8/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of imagine Drankor as having this very ritual calendar, with lots of days with magical purposes in a way, the reasons having been lost to time

{Reactions}
üëç

[8/8/2023 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway this is getting a bit beyond what I need for session prep and I still have to clean up the kitchen. I added a bunch of notes on Mirthblaze / whatever (still not sure about the name) to the google doc


[8/8/2023 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I do think it might make sense to set the homecoming festival to a fixed date, instead of based on the moon, though. maybe this was in Drankorian days celebrated also as the miracle of salvation, the day of thanks for when the gods rescued the Drankorians from the fall of Hkar?


[8/8/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
that could be pretty interesting - it could give it a fixed date sometime in Dec (after Dec 4th, but not when you all were in Tollen), it could give it an interestingly different gloss in Sembara and Chardon, where in Sembara it kind of merges with local solstice traditions and the imperial connotations fade


[8/8/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but perhaps this is not the right holiday for that


[8/8/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway feel free to play around however suits you with these ideas


[8/8/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Mos Numena could use a whole ritual calendar at some point. it is a little more complicated than the ritual calendar for the Dunmari Paantheon since Mos Numena is so diverse, but might be worth thinking about. there should probably be 6-10 relatively universal holidays with a bunch of smaller regional/local feast days overlaid


[8/8/2023 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
Agreed


[8/8/2023 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I had a lot of fun making the Dunmari ritual calendar. i think it is also really helpful for developing myths since often there will be myths associated with festivals, although perhaps less so for mos numena which is fairly diverse and diffuse, compared to dunmar where it is the state and cultural religion


[8/8/2023 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
I think the Mos Numena myths are really diverse. I like that the gods don‚Äôt really have personalities per se


[8/8/2023 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
So there is no story of when the Traveler did something


[8/8/2023 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
right like drankorian miracles don't really resonate in sembara


[8/8/2023 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
even the day of salvation or whatever that acknowledges the miracle of being rescued from hkar might have kind of lost its meaning over the years, especially as in drankor it would have never been associated with a specific god, and more celebrated as a national holiday


[8/8/2023 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
It‚Äôs all about blessings to the humans in their culture. To the Drankorians a lot of the divine is tied into magic, right?


[8/8/2023 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, and organized magic. this is my idea behind the ritual calendar and things like the intercalary days at the end of the year


[8/8/2023 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
this would have been associated with specific (now lost) magical practices


[8/8/2023 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
like maybe you can create a portal to another plane if you cast a specific spell each day during the 10 days of what is now mirthblaze


[8/8/2023 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah
