Attached, also added to doc.

  

This is 1750 DR, although I still haven't decided whether Tyrwingha is independent or not in the current day. Also, Cymea, Vostok, and Skaegenland are cultural/geographic areas, not necessarily single political entities (although working out details will probably need to wait until it matters).

  

In 1650 DR, Addermarch would be independent, the 3rd of the southern marcher kingdoms, but otherwise the map may look pretty similar. 

  

I have this in photoshop, with borders, map, and settlements on different layers, so it is easy to tweak.

  

The boundaries between Sembara and highland kingdoms would probably be kind of fluid, as would the control of borderlands and northern Addermarch, and the borderlands/southern marcher kingdom border. 

  

Will add some notes to your history later.

Looks great. Do you have any firm ideas for the two southern marches? I'm thinking of setting the campaign in WM1 around the headwaters of the River Enst, so the southern marches would be a key part of the landscape.

  

Also what do you have about Dunmore? Anything? The other area that would be a big deal is the other western marches.

Some ideas about southern marches can be gleaned from conflicts I am working on in main Sembara doc. I think both of them, but western one in particular, were originally settled in part by refugees from the south at the end of the Great War, and then just before Cece's reign were partially conquered / made into vassal states of whatever is west (hobgoblins/mind flayers/whatever works for your campaign).
