I was working on the Dunmari religion some last night, and I'm curious what you think of this basic outline. Doing this by email as I want to keep some parts of it secret for roleplaying and plot purposes.

  

The basic context of the Dunmari religion is as an early pantheonic religion, with personalized gods, the Five Siblings, who are seen as the children of Mother Sky (Shurat in Dunmari tradition, actually Ahra) and Father Earth (Sampa in Dunmari tradition, actually Malik). The key founding myth of the Dunmari states that the Five Siblings were the first gods born to Shurat and Sampa, and are the "special protectors" of the Dunmari people specifically. So Dunmari identity and Dunmari religion are deeply intertwined and not really separable. In their mythic histories, they left Hkar because the Five Siblings were given the world, but Hkar was given to humans and was the domain of Shurat and Sampa; the Dunmari were the people who felt the absence of the gods and left to find them, basically. Still tweaking the story, but ultimately the idea is the close connection with their specific gods.

  

The religion then has a few basic beliefs and tenets.

  

First, one of the key ideas is a kind of duality to worship -- there is the idea of asking the gods for help in your own life, but also the idea of keeping the attention of the gods on the welfare of the Dunmari people as a whole. Temples, the priesthood, and festivals are largely organized around the latter. So the idea is that festivals, such as the Festival of Rebirth, are a way of commemorating miracles that both remind Jeevali of what she did for and got from the Dunmari, and remind the Dunmari of what they did for and got from Jeevali -- deepening the intertwining of the state/culture and the gods. Temples then are manifestations of the state commitment to the gods, and are the center of festival life, and probably a good deal of state administration/government, but are not really a center of personal, daily prayer. So, for example, if you needed the help of Chidya to ensure a good lambing season you wouldn't go pray at the temple. Because the Dunmari are and were often nomadic, temples would grow up as sites of pilgrimage, places where you came for specific festivals and rituals, and often some of the first and most notable permanent structures. This aspect of worship would also be deeply concerned with ensuring that the government is "correct", in the sense of is run by the people whom the gods want to run it. (At least historically, Dunmar was ruled by a absolute ruler who was literally picked by the gods, first directly and then via the sacred horse, although the current state is a bit muddled as far as anyone on the outside can tell). 

  

In contrast, the kind of regular everyday prayer asking the gods to ensure your safety, or bless a marriage, or things like that would be associated with personal prayer and personal/family devotion. This would happen at small, portable family shrines, usually to a specific god that was of particular importance to you -- shepherds to Chidya, artisans to Sonkar, warriors to Aagir, etc. These would be largely iconography -- a statue of the god that you could carry with you, or something like that. Larger groups might be sure to have shrines to all five gods, but a lone scout traveling across the plains would likely just have a small statue of Chidya, to pray for the safety of her horse, or something like that. 

  

I'm toying with the idea that one exception to this is funerals / death, where e.g. the dead are cremated to return to their gods specifically in a way associated with temples and the priesthood, with the idea being that "the soul is returning to the community"; may also play a bit with a tinge of ancestor veneration with the idea that ancestors are with the gods, and so can remind the gods to pay attention to the Dunmari (kind of a faint Catholic saint vibe). Marriage is probably a shrine thing that doesn't need a priest, just needs to be witnessed by a god via a shrine. Coming of age ceremonies -- which might be seen as communal, becoming part of the Dunmari, are perhaps associated with temples and the priesthood. 

  

Finally, there is a third important strand of worship practice, the mystery cults. The idea here is that the mystery cults are largely an attempt to answer why the gods bothered to protect and nurture the Dunmari, what is their purpose? What were they chosen for? There is an idea that the future is fragile, that too much knowledge is dangerous, which may be true and/or may develop from the fact that the gods never come out and say exactly what the purpose of the Dunmari is supposed to be, if they even have one. So while for many Dunmari it is enough to know they are special and to participate in the rituals and festivals that seek to strengthen the bond between the gods and the people, for others the mystery cults are a way to ask "why". But, out of respect for the gods, and/or Divine command, the secrets the mystery cults probe is hidden, secret knowledge that is not shared outside the initiates. 

  

So, the TL;DR. The Dunmari are the special chosen people of their gods, who they see as the first gods and the inheritors of the world from Arha and Malik. Most of the outward facing religious practice -- temples and monuments (usually to all Five Siblings), the priesthood, festivals -- is organized around commemorating and strengthening that special relationship, and deepening the religious aspect of community, including the divine protection of the rulers of Dunmar. Inward facing practice is focused on daily prayers around small portable shrines, usually to single gods, usually iconographic. Separately, mystery cults probe the divine secrets, but don't reveal them to outsiders, because the future is fragile and knowledge of the divine may have negative consequences, and/or because the gods don't want them to.

  

Curious about your thoughts.

Here are some initial thoughts...

I like the idea of a religion that is intertwined with the culture. I think the story could be tweaked a bit. The absence of the gods feels a bit odd - why would you feel absent from a god that can grant your prayers? If your gods don't grant your prayers but everyone else's do, why do you worship them? I'd also be careful of a religious history that gives them a motivation to feel like Taelgar is "theirs" especially as the culture is really one of migration and movement, rather than ownership.

  

Maybe the flavor should be something about space -- the Five Siblings were not so much given the world as "left home to find somewhere they could be themselves" in some fashion.

Temples, the priesthood, and festivals are largely organized around the latter.

Is this a "hey don't forget about us" vibe? A "if we don't give them sacrifices they might not stay around  / protect our people vibe"? A "celebrate their greatness" vibe? "Prove we are worthy of your protection" vibe? Something else? I made up a religion once where the idea was that the god was seen as the behind-the-scenes protector of humanity, but that ultimately a state religion ala Rome was needed to focus the gods attention on the people, otherwise he might think them unworthy and withdraw protection. That kind of vibe leads to a religion focused on 'correctness' and doing the right set of things that the god needs to prove you are worthy. I think it's worth expanding on feeling at least of what it means to "keep the attention of the gods on the welfare of the people"

  

Also worth thinking about how non-Dunmari fit in. Can you convert? What would a Dunmari say to someone worshipping alongside them? Is it disrespectful? Weird? Ok if you go through a conversion process? Normal? Expected, if you live in Dunmar?

> So the idea is that festivals, such as the Festival of Rebirth, are a way of commemorating miracles that both remind Jeevali of what she did for and got from the Dunmari, and remind the Dunmari of what they did for and got from Jeevali -- deepening the intertwining of the state/culture and the gods.

(At least historically, Dunmar was ruled by a absolute ruler who was literally picked by the gods, first directly and then via the sacred horse, although the current state is a bit muddled as far as anyone on the outside can tell). 

The idea of temples as the basic structure of state administration I like. And the initial permanent structures and the focus of very specific rituals and festivals with a specific purpose. I think this description at least leaves me a bit unclear on what exactly the purpose of the festivals are. I think something along the lines that the Dunmari are, in some sense, defined as the people who worship the Five Siblings would make sense. So the festivals are as much a cultural celebration as a religious one, but because of the way in which the religion is intertwined with the culture/state, it comes out via festivals to the gods. I'm not sure it has to be tied to divine miracles per se. I'd leave the focus on venerating miracles to Mos Numena, and have this more be a celebration of the people and their gods. A prayer / festival / celebration that we made it to spring. Shehecheyanu and praise Jeevali (or whoever) that we made it to this day. The king won a battle. We made it through this, praise be to Chidya, etc, etc. Festivals oriented around giving thanks that the gods are part of the Dunmari, and that the Dunmari have made it to this day alive, and that the Dunmari have their gods. But very non-transactional -- the vibe wouldn't be "thanks you created a miracle that gave us food in the winter" but more "thank you, for we have made it together to this day, and neither of us would survive without the other".

  

(This is a bit rambling, but I hope you get the idea).

This might be a place to think about small miracles. Could these idols or tokens or totems have the occasional trivial miracle to show the gods are really there? I also wonder if it is more unique if these are specifically idols/statues, rather than shrines. I also am not sure I'd make the distinction just the way you have -- I like the personal vs the state, but I wonder if that is the right division. The king would get married at the temple, as a state occasion, because his wedding impacts the whole Dunmari. A personal wedding would be personal, because it is personal. Community thanksgiving -- the gnolls didn't kill us, we survived to fight another day -- would take place in the temple. Personal thanksgiving -- I survived this battle -- takes place privately, with your family's idol. Or maybe another way to think of it:  "we" prayers take place at temples, "I" prayers take place at home. 

  

It feels like this could be a cool cultural trait of the Dunmari, that I think kinda fits this distinction between "we" and "I" actions. Maybe it doesn't quite though and it probably needs a bit of refinement. Also I think maybe just a different way of stating what you are after?

 > I'm toying with the idea that one exception to this is funerals / death, where e.g. the dead are cremated to return to their gods specifically in a way associated with temples and the priesthood, with the idea being that "the soul is returning to the community"; may also play a bit with a tinge of ancestor veneration with the idea that ancestors are with the gods, and so can remind the gods to pay attention to the Dunmari (kind of a faint Catholic saint vibe).

I think temples would be the locus for both "joining the community" and "leaving the community" rites. But joining the community could be around birth, or it could be around coming of age. Death (leaving the community) definitely seems like a temple think, but I wonder if the vibe of "going home to the gods" would work better than "reminding the gods to pay attention". Maybe more of a "keeping their strength in the joint community of Dunmari-and-the-Five-Siblings" vibe -- but just moving to a different part of the community, the one with the gods, rather than on earth. So the ancestors don't have a "job", they aren't seen as who you might reach out to ala a Catholic saint to get the god to pay attention. More of a "the ancestors strengthen the heavenly community by their presence, just as a birth strengthens our earthly community" so it is important to have the correct rites to "send them home".

The idea here is that the mystery cults are largely an attempt to answer why the gods bothered to protect and nurture the Dunmari, what is their purpose? What were they chosen for?

I wonder if there is a way to make this a little less transactional. At a high level I think a lot of what I said above was a suggestion to try to move the Dunmari relationship with their gods away from a transactional, we-pray-so-they-protect-us system to more of a thanksgiving-and-community system were the Dunmari see themselves as in a community with their gods, and a lot of worship is about being grateful for being in that community. I don't have a clear sense of where that leaves mystery cults, although there are a lot of directions, and even with a less transactional vibe the exploration of why these gods are in this community with us (which might seem like a foundational miracle -- why did we, the Dunmari people, get blessed with these gods who 'fit' us and join us in celebrating our unique personhood and identity, and preserve and protect that identity).

  

There may also be some more 'ecstatic'  mystery cult possibilities -- a cult that is focused on being in even closer communion with their gods. But I don't know if that fits your vision.

 > So, the TL;DR. The Dunmari are the special chosen people of their gods, who they see as the first gods and the inheritors of the world from Arha and Malik.

TL;DR reaction -- a lot of this seems great, but my suggestion would be to move it away from the transactional/celebration of miracles, leaving that to Mos Numena, and drop the idea that the Dunmari are the inheritors of the world. Focus instead of the theme of 'special gods' in a community with a special people, who are blessed to have these gods to ensure their way of life and uniqueness never ends.

=============

Hmm, some things to think about. Thanks for the comments.

  

The "I" vs "we" distinction is exactly what I was going for with the duality of prayers -- temples are about "we", idols about "I". (where "I" in this case is 'family' as opposed to community, not literally I). 

  

I think on the miracles front, all religions fundamentally remember miracles. That is what festivals are. But I agree that the Dunmari vibe is more remembering the past as a cultural touchpoint. E.g., the Festival of Rebirth is far from just a religious festival, there are games, a feast, a market, tons of social interactions, basically one of the few times the whole community is together for most of the year. But of course it is also a touchstone and memory of a foundation miracle in Dunmari history. But the story goes that Jeevali sacrificed herself for the Dunmari, and they was reborn by their prayers. So it is really isn't transactional, it is more reminding the community (of humans and gods) what they did for each other. 

  

I also agree about dropping the inheritors of the world vibe - that was never intended. But I think that it is absolutely critical that the Dunmari have some sense of themselves not just as a special people, but as a special people chosen by the gods for a purpose. They were utterly decimated by Cha'mutte, losing not only most of their country but a huge fraction (>50%) of their population, largely in total war against insurmountable odds and supernatural terror. They were always supposed to be kind of the Rohirrim amped up to 1000, the noble people who would sacrifice themselves entirely to stop Cha'mutte. That vibe works better if there is a strong religious motivation behind it, I think. I could imagine this more in a Jewish "be the light unto the world" that doesn't really include a sense of land or territory, just a noble cause, although I also think "we were picked by the gods to pick this battle to prevent the darkness and we succeeded at great cost" has an interesting vibe. Anyway still thinking about this, but I do want to tie a religious motivation to the self-sacrfice during the Great War.

  

On mystery cults: definitely room for some of these to be more about closer communion with the gods rather than learning the secrets of the gods. I was just looking for a reason in Dunmari theology for why the mystery cults would exist.

=================

A few additional comments. Plus, a restatement. I guess the main thing I wanted to suggest you move away from is the language around "why do the gods bother to help us". There is a bit of that sense (the gods need to be reminded to protect us, why do the gods bother to nurture us, etc) flowing through what you've written.

  

And although I think that attitude (if we aren't careful, perhaps the gods will abandon us) is great, it feels to me very 'Mos Numena' in its vibe. It's ultimately a very Roman way of looking at religion and I think definitely has a place in Taelgar. But I think the Dunmari might work better with a "God Loves Us" Christian vibe. Complete self-confidence that the Five Siblings are the gods of the Dunmari, the Dunmari and the Five Siblings are one people, and of course the Five Siblings love, nurture, and protect the Dunmari because they are part of our community.

  

Doesn't mean they don't celebrate miracles, but it means they don't do it in a transactional sense and they don't have any sense that prayers and festivals are to get the god's attention.

  

The classic Mos Numena prayer would be: "Please help because I need X". The classic Dunmari prayer would be "Thank you for helping me make it to today healthy and alive"

(Which doesn't mean Mos Numena doesn't involve prayers of thanksgiving, and Dunmari doesn't involve prayers for aid, it's just an orientation).

Right, I didn't literally mean "I".

Right, I wasn't suggesting "miracles don't matter". But I think it is worth thinking about what makes different religions different on Taelgar. In thinking about Kestavo and Mos Numena, I sorta have been thinking:

  

* Mos Numena - big, impersonal gods without a clear 'personality'; significant focus on remembrance of miracles; transactional orientation

* Kestavo - many many spirits; personal relationship to spirit is important; dual relationship with Ahra/Malik seen as the granter of miracles and the spirit as the aide/supporter/community member

* Dunmari - cultural/collective ownership of gods; tight relationship between gods and cultural identity; worship focused on how the community needs the gods & the gods need the community

  

Which isn't to say Dunmari wouldn't remember miracles! Just I think it plays off other traditions better if the focus of every festival isn't remembrance of a miracle. Maybe some other festival is a celebration of a specific time (the coming of the spring rains, although I guess that slot might be used up) where the importance of the festival is about giving thanks to the gods that we made it to this time.

Yeah, this I like a lot and makes a ton of sense. I think it could work to have the "we have a higher purpose" vibe be strong. We, as a people, exist because the Five Siblings have a purpose for us. Perhaps, the exact purpose isn't always clear, or isn't clear, and part of the mystery cult tradition is trying to figure it out.

 > On mystery cults: definitely room for some of these to be more about closer communion with the gods rather than learning the secrets of the gods. I was just looking for a reason in Dunmari theology for why the mystery cults would exist.

Both probably works best.
