i'm aiming to finish adding dm_notes before considering other options. however, i think setting status/active could be a reasonable option for those pages

[1/16/2025 8:10 AM] rsulfuratus
fyi a much faster way to add dm_notes than the MoC pages is in search: -["dm_owner"] path:Gazetteer

[1/16/2025 8:35 AM] rsulfuratus
23 files left in gazetteer that need dm frontmatter, mostly Sembara or Istaros so for you to set

[1/16/2025 9:27 AM] Deciusmus
cleaned up all but 3

[1/16/2025 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
have nearly finished dm frontmatter for all pages, but need to take a break now to work briefly. another super-quiet day though so will do more later. I 've been tagging dm frontmatter for essentially every page, as I think it can be helpful, although obviously Campaigns is silly. a few notes incoming

[1/16/2025 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
(1) for big meta pages, I generally default to none/none, except for things like the world map (dm_owner: tim), and a few other places where i care about the text specifically (2) for a lot of things (e.g., cosmology, time), the distinction between shared and none is a bit unclear. i have tried to used shared for things where there are active discussions about canon, none for things that are blank slates or settled. but may not have been perfectly consistent. fine to change things, just drop a check/tim (3) i have actually been finding tagging dm_owner in worldbuilding can be pretty helpful. since these are all dm_notes, i am trying to tag dm_notes: none unless there are additional brainstorming docs elsewhere, or i haven't fully written down my thoughts. (High School Notes are the exception, of course)

[1/16/2025 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
(4) I've been going fast to just get things tagged so a few things may shift, but i feel pretty close to having a fairly complete "state of taelgarverse" system in place. just want to try to clean up stubs next

[1/16/2025 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
i've been using dm_owner: shared, dm_notes: important for that

[1/16/2025 10:29 AM] Deciusmus
I have a meeting, but my quick though is that we are missing a good way to capture pages where there is active shared worldbuilding that isn't captured in the obsidian note

[1/16/2025 10:30 AM] Deciusmus
(I have to go pay attention to a meeting but then I'm heading into the office for a lunch so might share some thoughts from the train)

[1/16/2025 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
or status/needswork/shared if the page itself is a mess

[1/16/2025 11:19 AM] rsulfuratus
(includes worldbuilding, which is where most of the missing/missing are from)

[1/16/2025 11:19 AM] rsulfuratus
dm_owner dm_notes count mike color 78 mike important 47 mike none 57 missing missing 93 none color 202 none important 36 none none 346 player important 38 shared color 6 shared important 69 shared none 15 tim color 138 tim important 487 tim none 28

[1/16/2025 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
I probably have a few too many tim/important

[1/16/2025 11:28 AM] Deciusmus
Is setting dm owner on Worldbuilding/Brainstorming useful?

[1/16/2025 11:31 AM] Deciusmus
i guess maybe it is

[1/16/2025 11:33 AM] Deciusmus
any reason not to just delete empty stub pages in brainstorming?

[1/16/2025 11:40 AM] Deciusmus
any reason not to move high school notes to Campaigns/Great War?

[1/16/2025 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
worldbuilding high school -> Campaigns/Great War is a good idea

[1/16/2025 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
empty stub pages in brainstorming should be deleted

[1/16/2025 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
i was distracted, working on a bunch of dataview tables (w chatGPT, surprisingly knows dataview pretty well) to better get as some of the data quality stuff, e.g. counts of typeOf details by descriptive tag, etc

[1/16/2025 11:58 AM] Deciusmus
A few thoughts from the train…

[1/16/2025 11:58 AM] Deciusmus
Ok I pushed a bunch of stuff

[1/16/2025 12:01 PM] Deciusmus
I think we have a handful of things that the current system makes hard to track..

[1/16/2025 12:03 PM] Deciusmus
Actually the above is really the only example

[1/16/2025 12:03 PM] Deciusmus
(A) pages where there is a lot of useful discussion outside of obsidian (either in old google docs or email or discord) where it would be valuable to just copy that in

[1/16/2025 12:04 PM] Deciusmus
More broadly though it is hard to tell if dm notes is supposed to be a “work list” or just a fact about the page.

[1/16/2025 12:05 PM] Deciusmus
Ie does dm_notes: color imply an intention to record the color in the note? Or is it expected that it would stay color forever and at some point the color gets lost or forgotten and we decide who cares and change to none?

[1/16/2025 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
for me, dm_notes means one of three things: (1) I have ideas about this note I want to write down, but haven't (2) I have external notes about this I want to copy, usually e.g. something like description or roleplaying notes for people from OneNote (if color), but occasionally images; for important this would obviously be more critical details (3) I have DM notes in Obsidian I should clean up I think (1) is by far the least common

[1/16/2025 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
in my ideal world, all of this would be copied into the page itself, either as public text, shared comments, or a secret

[1/16/2025 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so from that point of view, dm_notes to me implies a task list. but realistically a lot of this is likely never to get done, so it isn't like status/cleanup/incomplete

[1/16/2025 12:10 PM] Deciusmus
Right. For me I often set “color” on people who have come up in play but where there is no notes about their personality in obsidian. But I’ve often just improvised that so I don’t have other notes to copy in

[1/16/2025 12:11 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah.

[1/16/2025 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that would be (1) in some sense

[1/16/2025 12:12 PM] Deciusmus
Right

[1/16/2025 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but i also set e.g. dm_notes: none on some people (e.g., the Strongbones, the halfling family that ran an inn in Tokra) that I'm sure I improvised something about two years ago but they weren't important enough to write anything down so, whatever

[1/16/2025 12:16 PM] Deciusmus
I’m almost at the office… but I wonder mostly about the shared and none dm notes.

[1/16/2025 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that should probably be worked down

[1/16/2025 12:17 PM] Deciusmus
202 none/color seems like a lot for example

[1/16/2025 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a lot of none/color in People (106). a lot of those are people from early in the dunmar campaign i have notes on from onenote

[1/16/2025 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
most of those are pretty easy to just copy and paste my onenote note as a comment and set the dm_info -> none

[1/16/2025 12:19 PM] Deciusmus
I just wonder two additional categories might be useful… (A) discussions (name to be improved) which means that none of the dm notes are private and anyone who wants to dig through email discord etc and collate the notes on the page can flip to dm-notes: none

[1/16/2025 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
but have no particular attachment or plans for the person

[1/16/2025 12:21 PM] Deciusmus
But maybe (b) should just be none?

[1/16/2025 12:21 PM] Deciusmus
(B) vibes-(campaign) (also name to be improved) which means the person or place came up enough in a game that there are some useful vibes or roleplaying notes that could be shared but they are not important and probably are not worth writing down, so ask, but the answer might be “ I forget “

[1/16/2025 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
it is very useful to me to keep dm_notes focused on "how critical is the missing information". i think discussions, in particular, obscures that, because it could be color discussions or important discussions

[1/16/2025 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
vibes could be a useful gradient between none and color

[1/16/2025 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i have a meeting in 5 minutes and have to actually work until around 3 but will think on this a bit, might have more thoughts later.

[1/16/2025 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
it is really the (b) that is missing. e.g., there are things tagged dm_owner: shared that are really more "there are shared notes" not "we both have independent plans"

[1/16/2025 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
it does seem like we want to capture: (a) who, if anyone, has plans for something (b) who, if anyone, has notes about something (c) how critical are the notes

[1/16/2025 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, more later

[1/16/2025 12:28 PM] Deciusmus
Right. I was just thinking something similar.

[1/16/2025 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
from current system, would require:

[1/16/2025 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
here is a proposal for an update to dm frontmatter, aiming to capture all three of the points above with two frontmatter items. dm_notes remains the same: none, color, or important none = no information outside the page color = non-critical information outside the page important = critical information outside the page it is fairly easy to expand this with more levels if we want (e.g., vibes between none and color), but i'm not sure it is necessary dm_owner gets overloaded to solve the issues with missing a way to capture "who has notes". specifically: - if the dm_owner is a campaign (clee, dufr, addermarch, etc), or a combination of campaigns, that implies "some kind of important context for the specific campaign" - if the dm_owner is a person (tim, mike) or a combination of people (tim,mike), that implies "not active in a campaign but the person either (a) cares about the development of thing enough to want to be consulted, or (b) has unincorporated notes" - if the dm_owner is shared, that implies "subject to active joint development" - note the contrast with, say tim,mike. shared = joint notes, tim,mike or clee,dufr = each of us has independent dm notes. - if the dm_owner is none, implies no one has important future plans - if the dm_owner is meta, it is like none but implies a certain degree of centrality to the page in this setup, should not have dm_owner none or dm_owner meta unless dm_notes also is none. things that have color notes but no future plans should be dm_owner (name) and dm_notes color, for example. dm_owner shared should only be used when the dm_notes are shared; if we both have independent development should be dm_owner mike,tim. things could be dm_owner clee,tim for example, but ideally these should be rare. not sure this is perfect but idea might be worth iterating on

[1/16/2025 1:44 PM] rsulfuratus
(1) changing dm_owner (name) -> dm_owner (campaign) (2) adding dm_owner (name) to notes with dm_owner none and dm_notes != none (3) spending a little time reassigning dm_owner shared to either shared or some kind of combination (4) spending a little time reassigning dm_owner none to dm_owner meta

[1/16/2025 2:48 PM] Deciusmus
I like the basic idea, but I wonder if the distinction between person and campaign is too much.

[1/16/2025 2:49 PM] Deciusmus
To start, I think shared vs mike,tim is a good way to distinguish between a shared page vs we both have notes

[1/16/2025 2:54 PM] Deciusmus
I'm less sure about the campaign stuff...

[1/16/2025 2:56 PM] Deciusmus
(b) you have unincorporated color notes and DO care about the place/person

[1/16/2025 2:56 PM] Deciusmus
The basic problem I think is that it kinda breaks the goal of dm_owner originally. If I see a page from Adderfell campaign with dm_owner: tim dm_notes: color Does that mean (a) you have unincorporated color notes, but don't really care about the place/person OR

[1/16/2025 2:58 PM] Deciusmus
I also like dm_owner: meta - it is a good way to track "big" pages and is a nice constrast with shared, i.e. I would assume shared means = active conversations ongoing, or active conversations have happened in the past and are not incorporated in the notes meta means = restarting active development of this page probably needs at least a check/(other), but there is nothing active right now

[1/16/2025 2:59 PM] Deciusmus
and a dm_owner: shared could go from shared -> meta or shared -> none depending on the centrality of the page

[1/16/2025 3:04 PM] Deciusmus
Then re-review and see if adding a campaign flag vs a person flag makes sense

[1/16/2025 3:04 PM] Deciusmus
my suggestion would be, to start: review shared and move to mike,tim where correct review none to tag meta where correct * review dm_owner none / dm_notes != none for cases where the right thing is shared (i.e. the notes are all shared)

[1/16/2025 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/16/2025 3:06 PM] Deciusmus
I'm not sure exactly, but it seems nicer to clean up dm_owner = none / dm_notes != none and dm_owner = shared first, and than look at what is left in the dm_owner = none, dm_notes != none

[1/16/2025 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, maybe the campaign stuff is too much

[1/16/2025 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah but might not need frontmatter. dm_owner = none, dm_notes = color could just be handled with a comment

[1/16/2025 3:07 PM] Deciusmus
I think there might be some value in a way to flag this as "i have notes but I don't care about the future of this page"

[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
of which 10 are needswork/stub/check

[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] Deciusmus
so then we are left with none / color and the question becomes is it really worth caring about none/color

[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
only 36 pages with that configuration

[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] Deciusmus
(except for the dm_owner: shared as per above)

[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] Deciusmus
but I also think that for notes = important, that is probably wrong. If you or I have important notes, it is probably wrong to not have dm_owner set - no one can use the page meaningfully as more than vague background without talking to the owner

[1/16/2025 3:09 PM] Deciusmus
I'm in the office and have to go to a meeting but when I'm home I might look at the none/color to see what is there. I think I flagged a lot of stuff none/color

[1/16/2025 3:09 PM] Deciusmus
i

[1/16/2025 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
(excluding stub, needswork, check)

[1/16/2025 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
these are none/important Divine Presence complete High Gods complete Land of the Dead complete Battle of Metium complete Battle of Shadowfire complete Cleenseau Spider Attacks complete Battle Against Wakog complete Yemo'te complete Copper Hills complete Duchy of Sembara complete Duchy of Telham complete Erelion complete Antaka complete Western Gulf complete Chronicles of the Mawar complete Theba complete Amay complete Badya complete Isha complete Kisa complete Nora Silverspark complete Caelynn complete Illaran complete Godfrey of Marburgh complete Azer complete Scroll of Storykeeping complete

[1/16/2025 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
those are easy to clean up

[1/16/2025 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
it is kind of a random bunch of things. i think a lot of pages where i have a secret that doesn't need to be secret anymore (e.g., Badya, Theba, Kisa, Godfrey of Marburgh)

[1/16/2025 4:18 PM] Deciusmus
Ok, a few thoughts from the train back home…

[1/16/2025 4:23 PM] Deciusmus
What about reversing the meaning of a campaign dm owner, so that there are the following: (a) a campaign. The page was or is used in a campaign, and there is some information that came up in game (or in game prep) that isn’t incorporated - but the DM of that game has no further plans for the page. (b) person - private information exists and the person has plans (C) shared - all dm notes are shared (D) meta - the page is of broad important and is probably more a joint creation

[1/16/2025 4:25 PM] Deciusmus
These can be combined, ie you could have The Wyrdling dm_notes: important dm_owner: meta, clee That implies something important about the wyrdling came up in my game, and that major changes to the wyrdling should be pre-discussed

[1/16/2025 4:26 PM] Deciusmus
dm_owner: shared, meta On the other hand would imply that the important notes were in discord

[1/16/2025 4:27 PM] Deciusmus
Not sure though

[1/16/2025 4:28 PM] Deciusmus
Maybe forget the meta and shared stuff. But use owner = campaign as a shorthand for “the only notes are what I used in game”? Is that worth a special case?

[1/16/2025 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not convinced that the campaign part is useful, as opposed to dm_owner: none, dm_notes: color, and a comment with relevant info

[1/16/2025 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that your suggestion at 3:04 pm is still the right way to start

[1/16/2025 4:34 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah I agree

[1/16/2025 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
basically: - name: that person or people has plans - shared: ongoing joint discussion - meta: central enough to be careful with major revisions (good for e.g. religions, world region pages) - none: no plans, not central

[1/16/2025 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense

[1/16/2025 4:36 PM] Deciusmus
I do think it is completely reasonable, if the only “missing info” from the page is from in game events, to tag status/needswork/gameupdate or status/cleanup/gameupdate and set dm_notes to none

[1/16/2025 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
will do some more cleanup later tonight, going to Nathaniel's winter concert now

[1/16/2025 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed some MoC updates that should hopefully make sorting through things easier

[1/16/2025 8:32 PM] Deciusmus
that seems right

[1/16/2025 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at shared dm_owner. I think the only ones that are really actually mike,tim (as opposed to shared or meta) are: - amberglow - duskmire - twilight's grace - twilight court - mostreve hills - the rangers - de brunes - dominion of avatus - vahaiya - pyravela maybe worth adding: - addermarch - tyrwingha

[1/16/2025 8:33 PM] Deciusmus
I think Tyrwinghan and Addermarch are probably shared/meta

[1/16/2025 8:34 PM] Deciusmus
A few odd ones: Abelard Armand Artem Novolozek

[1/16/2025 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
those are all basically joint inventions and i wasn't sure all the notes were captured

[1/16/2025 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, i don't think there are private notes for any of those. armand backstory is all in discord, artem in email. abelard less certain but i think email

[1/16/2025 8:36 PM] Deciusmus
Actually, isn't shared meant to imply there are no private notes?

[1/16/2025 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
artem for sure has a bunch of details that are missing

[1/16/2025 8:37 PM] Deciusmus
I went through all the emails I could find, btw, and tagged them so I can pull them in

[1/16/2025 8:38 PM] Deciusmus
I mean, in worldbuilding or comments only, to be a source of stuff to mine and then delete

[1/16/2025 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yes

[1/16/2025 8:38 PM] Deciusmus
Do you think having raw copies of email threads in obsidian is valuable?

[1/16/2025 8:40 PM] Deciusmus
for some larger pages, maybe meta / none rather than none/none

[1/16/2025 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think that is correct

[1/16/2025 8:40 PM] Deciusmus
(maybe with a check/tim)

[1/16/2025 8:40 PM] Deciusmus
For Abelard, all I have on notes that isn't in obsidian is an image, which I am adding. Is it fair to say that for a page with dm_owner: shared if I add in all the emails or discord info I can find, it should become dm_owner: none, dm_notes: none?

[1/16/2025 8:42 PM] Deciusmus
agreed

[1/16/2025 8:42 PM] Deciusmus
right

[1/16/2025 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in general there is no reason to have a shared / none category, since the main point of shared is a way to mark "this is something that we have shared notes not captured, but it isn't central to the world or anyone's campaign"

[1/16/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
is that meta,tim? just meta?

[1/16/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
the only question is for things that have both ongoing discussion and some private notes (e.g., i made up a fair bit of mos numena backstory for the circular island that isn't incorporated yet), what do we tag them?

[1/16/2025 8:45 PM] Deciusmus
or shared,tim if there are active discussions that need to be pulled into obsidian (i.e. emails or discord or whatever)

[1/16/2025 8:45 PM] Deciusmus
I think meta,tim

[1/16/2025 8:46 PM] Deciusmus
although I'm not sure about that second one

[1/16/2025 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
then i think anything that is meta-relevant gets changed from [shared, none] -> meta

[1/16/2025 8:49 PM] Deciusmus
sure

[1/16/2025 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
there are now only 91 shared notes after I moved the ones above to mike,tim i might just take 10 minutes and change them to shared,tim if I do have private notes then push, and you can do the same. then we'd have: shared shared,tim shared,mike shared,tim,mike should be easy to sort from there

[1/16/2025 8:51 PM] Deciusmus
are you fixing now? we shouldn't do it at the same time or we will have conflicts

[1/16/2025 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
give me five more minutes

[1/16/2025 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i'm doing it now

[1/16/2025 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
MoC broken now but this search should still get shared pages: ["dm_owner":"shared"]

[1/16/2025 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed

[1/16/2025 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed MoC update

[1/16/2025 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that is probably just a copy-paste mistake

[1/16/2025 9:15 PM] Deciusmus
is there a reason for that?

[1/16/2025 9:15 PM] Deciusmus
wyrdling is dm owner tim whereas most gods are shared

[1/16/2025 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
you should change that, i do have a few random color notes so put shared,tim for now plus whatever you have

[1/16/2025 9:18 PM] Deciusmus
ok I pushed my updates

[1/16/2025 9:21 PM] Deciusmus
I'm changing dm_owner: shared / dm_notes none to meta mostly

[1/16/2025 9:22 PM] Deciusmus
yeah the notes shouldn't be none you are right

[1/16/2025 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that is shared because we have some discussion about it?

[1/16/2025 9:22 PM] Deciusmus
I might just put it as none

[1/16/2025 9:22 PM] Deciusmus
Highland Conquest Wars? Is that really worth meta?

[1/16/2025 9:24 PM] Deciusmus
A Story about Halfing Merchants? That probably doesn't need a DM owner

[1/16/2025 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at the "just shared" stuff there are a handful mistagged with dm_notes: none that do have dm_notes, and then basically three categories: - joint inventions for a game (e.g., armand, abelard) where it should be easy to just grab the notes and set to none/none - ongoing discussion (mostly sembaran history and elven stuff and deep world history) - meta stuff (gods, religions, species)

[1/16/2025 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that should be none/none

[1/16/2025 9:26 PM] Deciusmus
yes

[1/16/2025 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
sylvan writing as well i think all the discussion is captured by the note

[1/16/2025 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
i have some notes, that shouldn't be none

[1/16/2025 9:27 PM] Deciusmus
do you actually have notes? I don't think there was much shared dscussion

[1/16/2025 9:27 PM] Deciusmus
ok I cleaned up, Undead ? It is shared,tim / none

[1/16/2025 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
if you push i can look at changes

[1/16/2025 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
probably i tagged shared meaning "meta" and didn't remember to update notes to important

[1/16/2025 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[1/16/2025 9:28 PM] Deciusmus
i assume it should be important

[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] Deciusmus
needed to go plug i my laptop

[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] Deciusmus
one sec

[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] Deciusmus
ya to a few

[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
did you add meta?

[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
and see what is left

[1/16/2025 9:30 PM] Deciusmus
I pushing a change that sets the following to meta/none: Aldanor Region Map * a few random brainstorming pages that are themselves dumps of notes

[1/16/2025 9:31 PM] Deciusmus
pushed

[1/16/2025 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, i'm pulling now

[1/16/2025 9:31 PM] Deciusmus
and fixes notes: none for a few other shared pages, and sets a couple to none/none (either discussed above or with status/tim)

[1/16/2025 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
for the remaining shared notes, i think i would change all playable species to meta by default, regardless. as well as kestavo, tanshi, and mos numena main pages, and mos numena gods

[1/16/2025 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
compared to say addermarch

[1/16/2025 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually i'm now wondering about meta - because for example i think the Chardonian Empire, although "meta", is probably not really "meta" in the sense that i'm developing in relatively in isolation. same with dunmar

[1/16/2025 9:34 PM] Deciusmus
yes, although some of those might have shared discussions to capture, right?

[1/16/2025 9:35 PM] Deciusmus
rather than a dm_owner

[1/16/2025 9:35 PM] Deciusmus
I actually wonder if it is better to have a tag for shared notes to import

[1/16/2025 9:35 PM] Deciusmus
joint?

[1/16/2025 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
so i think meta doesn't really mean meta, it just means "automatically relevant to multiple campaigns"

[1/16/2025 9:36 PM] Deciusmus
or status/check/external

[1/16/2025 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah maybe that is better. status/external perhaps

[1/16/2025 9:37 PM] Deciusmus
right

[1/16/2025 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i would consider "look for external notes" to be more like "cleanup/incomplete" than "check" as it doesn't imply anything wrong with existing text

[1/16/2025 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i was actually thinking about splitting status. in a lot of the MoC stuff, i find myself wanting to do: active, stub, needswork, check, complete

[1/16/2025 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
we don't have cleanup/external, so could just use that

[1/16/2025 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't actually want to add another top-level status tag as i'd have to fix all the dataview

[1/16/2025 9:40 PM] Deciusmus
sure

[1/16/2025 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
zimka i think is more you

[1/16/2025 9:45 PM] Deciusmus
yeah that sounds right; plus kestavo and zimka unless you are leaving that as just mike

[1/16/2025 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
(oh plus mos numena)

[1/16/2025 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure how much more i'm going to do tonight but i think the key "joint" things would be: - general feywild stuff (fey, feywild pages mostly) - languages & playable species - large-scale sembaran history - addermarch / tyrwingha / sembara top-level pages but not lower-level pages - elven stuff - deno'qai stuff

[1/16/2025 9:46 PM] Deciusmus
yeah

[1/16/2025 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe better to just tag the "northern folk religions" page as joint

[1/16/2025 9:46 PM] Deciusmus
I'm going to go watch a show with Dana; but I actually think if we had (a) cleanup/external to mean there are external notes to find and copy in (b) dm_owner: joint to mean we are developing the page together (c) dm_owner: mike, tim to mean we are developing separately but want to coordinate It would be fairly clear. dm_owner: none then means either (a) the page is done and you have no further plans or (b) the page is not done but no one has plans.

[1/16/2025 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
kestavo i guess to the extent it plays into the larger "northern folk religions"

[1/16/2025 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
there will probably be another round of cleanup / check/mike stuff, i'll tag you if i'm not certain (can also look at commit history)

[1/16/2025 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, i am going to spend 20 minutes or so on this, maybe more depending on how sucked in i get

[1/16/2025 9:53 PM] Deciusmus
One thought - dm owner is basically who is developing the incomplete page which is good. That means dm owner none / dm notes is basically a page you are “done with” but never finished, which is kinda fine and a decent way to think about it.

[1/16/2025 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
right. in my case at least the dm_owner: none / dm_notes: important are pages i'd like to finish and probably should finish. but yes i think that is a good interpretation

[1/17/2025 8:42 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed a bunch of stuff last night and this morning. i have a bunch of scattered 30 minute meetings today so probably won't be particularly coherent for extended discussion but will likely be slowly working on note cleanup throughout the day. will try to pull before doing any editing and push before going back to a meeting so as to avoid merge conflicts. my main goal is to turn everything that is shared,tim into joint or none depending on context, so those are the main notes i'll work on

[1/17/2025 8:44 AM] rsulfuratus
my general interpretation has been that dm_notes should be used for private/non-shared notes, and if the only notes are shared, i've been setting dm_notes: none and status/cleanup/external

[1/17/2025 8:50 AM] Deciusmus
to the extent I'm doing stuff today I'm trying to pull in emails

[1/17/2025 9:29 AM] Deciusmus
I don't think I will update status much

[1/17/2025 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus
doing a bit of cleanup of mos numena gods - Kiya has really done a lot of nice worldbuilding around ordinary people's experience of the divine. it would be nice to perhaps pick a few of those stories to share as sources in primary sources, with her permission.

[1/17/2025 10:08 AM] Deciusmus
I’ll ask her. She was happy for me to publish them on my version of taelgarverse

[1/17/2025 11:16 AM] rsulfuratus
also have an html with all the images but the image directory is fairly big

[1/17/2025 11:16 AM] Deciusmus
I was just doign the same thing!

[1/17/2025 11:16 AM] rsulfuratus
found a tool to download discord chat history. added entire dm log to Worldbuilding/External for ease of searching. it is a text file (too many random < and # to convert to markdown easily) for now

[1/17/2025 11:25 AM] Deciusmus
the discord log is actually mostly discussion of obsidian and git workflows, not actual worldbuilding

[1/17/2025 11:31 AM] Deciusmus
the fact that the secret is present is obvious

[1/17/2025 11:31 AM] Deciusmus
I'd say none

[1/17/2025 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
how should I tag dm notes when all my dm notes are in a secret on the note itself?

[1/17/2025 1:40 PM] Deciusmus
kiya happy for you to publish whatever of the celyn stories

[1/17/2025 2:05 PM] Deciusmus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/2279_1_1_image.png.ctGXWYfly8.png)

[1/17/2025 2:05 PM] Deciusmus
you can annotate a file so it shows who chnaged which bits

[1/17/2025 2:05 PM] Deciusmus
The git plugin for obisidian is kinda nice

[1/17/2025 2:06 PM] Deciusmus
yeah

[1/17/2025 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
it is just "Git" with ~1m downloads?

[1/17/2025 2:09 PM] Deciusmus
you have to run the command to toggle author info

[1/17/2025 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[1/17/2025 2:21 PM] Deciusmus
"old" is probably right for say elves

[1/17/2025 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah was just thinking that

[1/17/2025 2:21 PM] Deciusmus
I think we should get rid of needswork/shared in general

[1/17/2025 4:25 PM] Deciusmus
are you doing any scraping from discord chat log at the moment? I added a "discord-log-edits" where I extract the stuff I've moved to a Discord Chat - Topic note

[1/17/2025 4:26 PM] Deciusmus
I saw that; I chopped them out of my tracking doc

[1/17/2025 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
ah good to know. i made a few notes, on dwarven and hkaran calander

[1/17/2025 4:27 PM] Deciusmus
I might spend an hour trying to organize brainstorming/email/discord/etc around topics, i.e. make a Brainstorming/Calendars and pull everything that isn't canonical into it

[1/17/2025 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
i was just working on that for climate

[1/17/2025 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
worldbuilding could use a little cleanup, actually

[1/17/2025 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
for climate i tried to dump a bunch of emails and some of my old notes/wind maps into one doc

[1/17/2025 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for calendar stuff i added links in a comment in the Calendar Eras main page to a handful of calendar brainstorming notes

[1/17/2025 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I have no strong opinions on brainstorming organization if you want to mess around

[1/17/2025 4:41 PM] Deciusmus
i.e.

[1/17/2025 4:41 PM] Deciusmus
I was thinking it might be useful to have folders under brainstorming to organize stuff

[1/17/2025 4:51 PM] Deciusmus
But I'm not sure

[1/17/2025 4:51 PM] Deciusmus
my opinion is to just delete it

[1/17/2025 4:51 PM] Deciusmus
What do you think about keeping around brainstorming material that has been incorporated into a note?

[1/17/2025 4:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i kind of like being able to see how we came to a certain decision without having to dig in the git history. but it depends on the context. this is mostly true for things where the brainstorming doc has a lot of back and forth or captures an old email. i might just mark it as "`%%` Incorporated into [[note]]"

[1/17/2025 4:54 PM] Deciusmus
The elvish note was: Elves fundamentally simply count ka. Nothing is really super-fixed within a ka, but ka are very regular. I kind of feel there is maybe something a bit fey here? Like the elves care more about the cycles of extraplanar energy and the waxing and waning of Aldanor’s influence than the sun. Maybe even call parts of each cycle Aldanor waxing or Elmerica waning. In some sense years are probably more analogous to months for humans, seasons are weeks, and there is no real sense of anything between a day and a season as being important to track.

[1/17/2025 4:54 PM] Deciusmus
In this case, I pulled the Google Docs version of the Calendar Ideas into obisidian and split it up into dwarven/elven/hkar/drankorian brainstorming pages

[1/17/2025 4:54 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps we need a Brainstorming/Archive folder

[1/17/2025 4:55 PM] Deciusmus
I like keeping the discord chat logs

[1/17/2025 4:55 PM] Deciusmus
Which is fairly similar to what ended up in the main calendar eras page and I wasn't sure that the note was worth keeping

[1/17/2025 4:56 PM] Deciusmus
ok, I guess no real benefit in deleting in this case

[1/17/2025 4:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i would just keep that. what is the benefit of deleting? i think there is actually some useful context in being able to check that because we often "clean up" ideas to read more like a wikipedia article for publication but having the more informal presentation can be useful to get a vibe

[1/17/2025 5:02 PM] Deciusmus
what about cases where the text was basically just copied and pasted into another doc?

[1/17/2025 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
that i'd delete

[1/17/2025 8:33 PM] Deciusmus
Might spend some time trying to reorganize brainstorming over tomorrow as well

[1/17/2025 8:33 PM] Deciusmus
I’m almost done with processing the discord chat log. Will probably finish tomorrow as Dana is working

[1/18/2025 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
we are going up to NH today so i don't know how much taelgar stuff i'll do or whether i'll be online much. was just poking around a little while kate does a quick errand, and thinking that getting discord notes into obsidian obviates a lot of the need for things like status/cleanup/external and the dm_owner: shared and all that. i think that everything from google drive is largely in obsidian anyway, and in any case that would be fairly easy to dump in there. the biggest question is whether it is worth trying to mass-download emails and put them in obsidian as raw notes, that seems a little more tricky. but if we had google drive, email, and discord as external sources in obsidian, we could drop all the tagging about shared external stuff, and just use dm_notes for private information from my old OneNote, emails with other people (mostly you to your players) and our separate dm folders in Obsidian

[1/18/2025 9:46 AM] Deciusmus
But yes, I think dm_notes for private info is where we should end up

[1/18/2025 9:46 AM] Deciusmus
Yeah - I actually have been uploading emails as well. There are actually not that many of them.

[1/18/2025 9:49 AM] Deciusmus
Then all shared conversations in brainstorming

[1/18/2025 9:49 AM] Deciusmus
My goal was to have: status/cleanup/gameupdate and status/needswork/game update for cases where the only thing missing from the page is stuff that came up in game (In particular using that instead of dm_notes: color for the cases where the only thing missing is vibes or roleplaying notes that I invented on the spot while running the character)

[1/18/2025 9:50 AM] Deciusmus
And then use dm_notes only pretty much for stuff where either (A) I’ve made something up but haven’t written it down (B) I have private dm notes

[1/18/2025 9:52 AM] rsulfuratus
that sounds great

[1/18/2025 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
we are packing up now but i'll be on and off

[1/18/2025 9:54 AM] Deciusmus
Dana is working and Z has plans with friends so I am likely to spend most of the afternoon on this

[1/18/2025 1:34 PM] Deciusmus
the full discord chat log is broken up into individual chats

[1/18/2025 1:34 PM] Deciusmus
I pushed

[1/18/2025 1:34 PM] rsulfuratus
might do a little messing around this afternoon - can you push if you have done anything?

[1/18/2025 1:35 PM] Deciusmus
I spent almost two hours at the bank trying to deposit Zachary's bar mitzvah checks but am now back home lookiing at this again

[1/18/2025 1:35 PM] Deciusmus
and the 70% of it that is about git/obsidian/status tags/etc deleted (although I kept your version as the full chat log just for posterity)

[1/18/2025 2:03 PM] Deciusmus
So pulling in all these emails and discord chats is making me think we would benefit from a somewhat better system from organizing "non-canon" background material

[1/18/2025 2:12 PM] Deciusmus
I'm poking around, will share ideas if I have any

[1/18/2025 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm open to ideas, i don't have any brilliant suggestions myself

[1/18/2025 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe it is worth promoting brainstorming to a top-level directory?

[1/18/2025 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing i was thinking about while driving up here is that i like the style of the Multiverse page, which is written with a bit more 'in-world' color. for things like people and gazetteer it doesn't necessarily make sense, but i was going to take a crack at rewriting a few of the cosmology pages in that style. i was thinking specifically for cosmology - planes, religions, gods - what I'd really like are: (1) "in world" pages for publication written in the style of the Multiverse page (2) background pages in the main document set to excludePublish["all"] that represent canonical information about cosmology/planes/gods that doesn't make sense to publish (3) brainstorming pages

[1/18/2025 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
i kind of wonder though why we have things like "divine order" in background instead of cosmology

[1/18/2025 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
sure

[1/18/2025 2:19 PM] Deciusmus
and keep worldbuilding for "work in progress"

[1/18/2025 2:19 PM] Deciusmus
I was thinking perhaps the opposite, make Background a top level directory

[1/18/2025 2:20 PM] Deciusmus
right, for some specific pages like that, sure

[1/18/2025 2:20 PM] rsulfuratus
the original idea was just to make it easy to exclude from export but that seems a little pointless now since we can just excludePublish["all"]

[1/18/2025 2:21 PM] Deciusmus
Background is useful for random little canonical snippets that don't have another home though, I think. And also for more "meta" pages (Creating new Species)

[1/18/2025 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm going to move background, but let you reorganize worldbuilding however you want, if you want

[1/18/2025 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, okay, i think promoting background and then just treating anything in worldbuilding as non-canon makes sense

[1/18/2025 2:25 PM] Deciusmus
My other thought was that for "big" pages (like say Sembara or Tyrwingha) that have lots of `%%` comments, it is better to move the `%%` comments to a Sembara - Ideas (or whatever) document in brainstorming, rather than just a wall of comments in the main doc

[1/18/2025 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
comments are really only good for inline discussion, having a big wall at the end is a bit hard to read

[1/18/2025 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i was thinking same thing

[1/18/2025 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
my first project is going to be to reorganize cosmology to: (1) rewrite some pages in-world (2) move relevant pages from background to cosmology as needed, setting excludePublish (3) make a worldbuilding/cosmology directory for brainstorming info about cosmology, and move large comment blocks there

[1/18/2025 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
don't know how much i'll actually do this afternoon but we'll see

[1/18/2025 2:29 PM] Deciusmus
the end state goal would be something like.... On pages outside of Worldbuilding, anything on the page should be considered canon. Exceptions would be explicit comments that state something as non-canonical. In general, if there is a lot of unprocessed or non-canon information about a topic, make a worldubilding page (or folder) and link to it (ala a wikipedia talk page)

[1/18/2025 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a new version of astral plane, curious what you think about basic format of in-world scholarly discussion first, then a campaign:none block with "dm notes" and link to brainstorming pages

[1/18/2025 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
pushing now

[1/18/2025 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yes

[1/18/2025 3:42 PM] Deciusmus
did you forget to push

[1/18/2025 3:42 PM] Deciusmus
not seeing it

[1/18/2025 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
sensible. i think okay to occasionally stick a dm owner on brainstorming docs, but status tags and dm notes never make sense.

[1/18/2025 3:45 PM] Deciusmus
I'm updating MOC to exclude worldbuilding from tag/dmnote stuff

[1/18/2025 3:46 PM] Deciusmus
yeah, for the "counts" and "are all pages set with owners/notes/status" I wanted to exclude

[1/18/2025 3:47 PM] Deciusmus
I think that Astral Plane page is really good

[1/18/2025 3:48 PM] Deciusmus
the dangling link to "planar dualism" is particularly juicy

[1/18/2025 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i am going to get carried away and invent tons of schools of metaphysical thought on taelgar i can tell

[1/18/2025 3:53 PM] Deciusmus
I'm trying to clean up some `%%` comments on pages and move them to brainstorming. On for example the Sibyl's Hall page, there is an old comment from One Note, but it seems to have been mostly incporated into the page

[1/18/2025 3:54 PM] Deciusmus
Is that kind of note (a) worth keeping on the page as is (b) just delete it (c) move to a brainstorming doc (d) tag status/tim to see what you want to do

[1/18/2025 3:54 PM] Deciusmus
The only bit that hasn't is a hint that the reason it had declining funds had somethin to do with a change in the power of religious orders

[1/18/2025 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
but also fine to just tag status/check/tim and let me deal

[1/18/2025 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i think something like that the implication is that the decline in power of religious orders was something i wasn't sure about and didnt come up in game. i think in that case - if is obvious - i'd leave a short comment like "potential reason for current day lack of funds: decline in power of religious orders" and otherwise delete the note

[1/18/2025 4:10 PM] Deciusmus
yeah makes sense to me

[1/18/2025 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i would like to propose we move all the cosmology pages that describe locations within a plane, as opposed to planes themselve, to gazetteer, in an "extraplanar" section. i'm going to be adding lots of places in the feywild and the plane of fire, at least, and they are much more in the style of gazetteer pages than what i'm trting to do with cosmology

[1/18/2025 4:41 PM] Deciusmus
I'm trying to organize/cleaup history a bit

[1/18/2025 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
someday i will probably do that but doesn't feel as useful as the cosmology stuff

[1/18/2025 4:42 PM] Deciusmus
I did want to resolve the major "cleanup" note in the existing document, which is to restructure it to have only 3 "eras" rather than 4, i.e. (a) age before time (b) age of creation (riving - downfall) (c) age of humanity

[1/18/2025 4:42 PM] Deciusmus
It should really be rewritten in your in-world style, but I don't have the time or energy for that

[1/18/2025 4:43 PM] Deciusmus
that is, there was no interest in the creation of humanity being i.e. when the land of dead came into being or something like that

[1/18/2025 4:43 PM] Deciusmus
But there is some debate in our discord chats about whether that is correct, or whether the creation of humanity was metaphyiscally significant. I think we agreed it wasn't, or if it was, it wasn't as significant as the riving or the downfall, right?

[1/18/2025 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
(put it in the in-world style)

[1/18/2025 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
fundamentally the dividing lines are (a) riving and (b) destruction of hkar

[1/18/2025 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/18/2025 4:45 PM] Deciusmus
yeah

[1/18/2025 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
cosmology coming along. one organizational issue - I currently have "top level" pages for multiverse, the fundamental planes that don't fit elsewhere; and then directories for echo realms, spiritual realms, and energy realms. however there are also a lot of random notes mostly about how the planes connect to the material plane (e.g., extranplanar weak points) or about the material of the planes (e.g., soulstuff). I guess these could all go into background, but some of them (extraplanar weak points for sure) seem kind of useful to publish, so i don't love that. however I can't come up with a good name for a subdirectory that is "misc stuff connected to planes but not actually planes themselves"

[1/18/2025 5:21 PM] Deciusmus
Background of the Multiverse?

[1/18/2025 5:21 PM] Deciusmus
Planar Concepts?

[1/18/2025 5:22 PM] Deciusmus
all sentient species, gods, etc were all created during the age of creation

[1/18/2025 5:22 PM] Deciusmus
I am running a D&D game for Z and his friends tonight so Ive mostly been prepping, but I am also working on the refactor of history. The "age of creation" between riving and downfall works really well, because it is basically the age when almost everything was created

[1/18/2025 5:23 PM] Deciusmus
yeah in the previous discord chat we decided to leave them in the background material for now, but that they were explicitly not in game terms

[1/18/2025 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i've been using (inconsistently) mythic history or days of myth for pre-Riving

[1/18/2025 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i think my feeling we shouldn't use "age of x" though

[1/18/2025 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[1/18/2025 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
going to try to finish all the top-level pages tonight

[1/18/2025 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a cosmology reorg

[1/18/2025 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
You can kind of piece together planar dualism if you squint

[1/18/2025 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
But have to cook now. Enjoy the dangling links

[1/18/2025 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
have generally not been setting status/check/mike, although feel free to review and send me comments on planar pages (should be obvious which ones are updated). did set status/check/mike for Far Realms.

[1/18/2025 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
really getting carried away with the in-world scholarship. just made up the Yendalist Heresy

[1/18/2025 8:40 PM] Deciusmus
do extraplaner weak points imply "outer realms"? I guess not, because Shadowfolds is mentioned

[1/18/2025 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
no - elemental planes as well

[1/18/2025 8:42 PM] Deciusmus
we did have a discussion about it

[1/18/2025 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
kate and i are doing the crossword now but will think a bit - i think we have some old discussion of this

[1/18/2025 8:42 PM] Deciusmus
It would explain, potentially, the on-again-off-again portal, and the timing of it appearing after Cha'mutte's death is interesting.

[1/18/2025 8:42 PM] Deciusmus
It occured to me maybe there is an extraplanar weak point to the fey wild in the Cleenseau Wood

[1/18/2025 8:43 PM] Deciusmus
Ultimately I think we decided the mechanics of portals are a bit unique and there is no particular reason one has to be "explained"

[1/19/2025 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
not likely to do a ton of taelgarverse cleanup today, but one question. working on cosmology and there are some pages that are hard to develop because there are unresolved questions, e.g., Spiritual Realms. the page is fine as written but the notes have open questions. none of our existing tags or frontmatter seem to capture this situation particularly well. there isn't additional information elsewhere in private notes (so no dm_notes), and the public text is correct, if shallow (so no status/needswork tags). status/cleanup doesn't seem correct either because the block is actual invention, not collation of details, etc. is this a situation worth capturing, and if so how? possibly just something like status/openquestions?

[1/19/2025 10:53 AM] Deciusmus
I've been thinking about the same thing around history cleanup that I've been sorta working on

[1/19/2025 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
for now I put: `%%` OPEN QUESTIONS `%%` at the top of pages (so far just Spiritual Realms) that have open questions, and `%%` TO DO `%%` at the top of pages that have specific to-do task lists in comments at the end.

[1/19/2025 10:56 AM] Deciusmus
My idealize end state would be, for these types of big topics (grand sweep of history, religions, cosmology, human cultures, species), something like: The pages in (Cosmology, Organizations, History) are mostly "in-world", with some DM notes, and contain only canonical or mostly canonical information There are "framework" pages that provide both organizational meta-information (i.e. the "creating new species" document) and a place to capture known stuff in a more bulleted form especially when the known stuff isn't sufficient to create a real page (these would be in Background and should follow dm tag/status tag conventions but are also not as fully canonically as "real" pages) * There are brainstorming pages or folders in Worldbuilding for more speculative ideas

[1/19/2025 10:57 AM] Deciusmus
For something like Cosmoslogy, we know that the spirtual realms are: Created in some fashion by "soul stuff" At least some of them are created by the human divine spark * Are related to the afterlife and gods But the details beyond that are perhaps a bit vauge. That's a good thing to capture in a framework page

[1/19/2025 10:59 AM] Deciusmus
For cosmology, the campaign none blocks might be doing all the work, actually

[1/19/2025 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
Sure, I’ve been using campaign none blocks for this a bit. The distinction is I guess between pages where that information is largely complete (usually room for expansion but a settled framework) and where it is not (eg spiritual realms)

[1/19/2025 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
Yeah for that I think framework pages are great

[1/19/2025 11:00 AM] Deciusmus
so there is no page to put the campaign none block on

[1/19/2025 11:00 AM] Deciusmus
for history I was finding that a campaign none block doesn't really work, because what I really want is something that provides a historical framework but doesn't define any actual events at all

[1/19/2025 11:01 AM] Deciusmus
but actually I'm not sure there is really a need, in the spirtual realms page, to tag it specially at all

[1/19/2025 11:02 AM] Deciusmus
Although I'd be tempted to split off some of the specualiation about how different religions see each others divine realms into a separate page - say a Worldbuilding/Spritual Realms - Open Questions or whatever

[1/19/2025 11:03 AM] Deciusmus
If we make a Worldbuilding\Open Questions folder it would then be easy enough to even have a MOC page that shows eveything that is backlinked from the Open Questions folder

[1/19/2025 11:03 AM] Deciusmus
Maybe that is the best pattern, is to just create a "Wikipedia talk page" style "Open Questions" document for things where there are really fundamentally unsettled open questions and then link it from the main page

[1/19/2025 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I kind of like that. We are about to hike to the ledges but I’ll think a bit while we walk and if you feel like doing any reorg I’d be in favor of that proposal

[1/19/2025 3:44 PM] Deciusmus
Ok I'm doing quite a bit of refactoring of the historical framework

[1/19/2025 3:46 PM] Deciusmus
I should probably push what I have, in case you want to look. I'm basically structuring it as (a) a "historical framework" page that captures the major sweep of history, in a DM-facing tone (very similar to your "campaign none" DM notes) (b) a "open questions" page that lists unresolved issues (c) a "discussion" page that includes a lot of background and links to chats that provide rationales for why we ended up with the specific decisions we made as well as older since-discarded thoughts. This type of structure might only make sense for historical framework, as it is a somewhat unique topic, but am finding the open questions document a very useful way to organize undecided bits

[1/19/2025 3:49 PM] Deciusmus
(I pushed a very draft/wip version)

[1/19/2025 5:36 PM] Deciusmus
Do you have a date for when Chardon was founded?

[1/19/2025 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't have an exact date. but great library is founded in 688

[1/19/2025 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
and darba is founded in 377 as a fort on the frontier

[1/19/2025 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
drankorian western wars end between 628 and 647

[1/19/2025 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
so i'd presume that chardon is sometime between 500 and 650

[1/19/2025 7:15 PM] Deciusmus
I'm pushing a big reorg of Worldbuilding... I've moved everything to one of 7 folders: Brainstorming: Decently formed, relatively non-obsolete brainstorming notes about varous topics. Chats and Emails - raw dumps of discord chats and emails Discussions - "Wikipedia talk" pages for major topics, where we might want to record some of the reasoning behind topics, or have a place to record thoughts Old Documents - relatively large chunks of text that is obsolete enough that it is probably better to rewrite, or at least, requires a major project to rewrite it Open Questions - open question pages, designed to list specific unaddressed questions from other major topics Research and Mechanics - pages that are either real-world research of more about running games and mechanics than worldbuilding (could be a place to share some of my bestiary, for example) * Tenative - explicitly for pages that may or may not exist, but would otherwise be "little" pages elsewhere in the tree

[1/19/2025 7:16 PM] Deciusmus
I've also moved a few pages to Background from Worldbuilding that seem like the basis of solid background notes, even if they are not fully canonical, with warning flags.

[1/19/2025 7:19 PM] rsulfuratus
i like your history setup

[1/19/2025 7:19 PM] rsulfuratus
sounds great

[1/19/2025 7:29 PM] Deciusmus
I've moving name lists to Research and Mechanics and sharing a few of my _DM folder ones

[1/20/2025 9:32 AM] rsulfuratus
i like your far realm updates

[1/20/2025 10:28 AM] Deciusmus
what's the status of maps right now? I was trying to make slightly better regional divisions than what we have right now, basically so that I could more clearly define what areas of the world don't have any defined history, or have only very specific single historical events

[1/20/2025 10:29 AM] Deciusmus
There is a world-map-regions and a world-map-climate both of which are a little bit different in the base layer and neither of which has the same base layer as the player map

[1/20/2025 10:30 AM] Deciusmus
Is this all one photoshop file that you are pulling different layers out of?

[1/20/2025 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Maps are a bit of a mess. There is just one giant photoshop map with many layers that is getting a bit unwieldy. Plus I have some regional hex maps that occasionally have detail missing from the main map

[1/20/2025 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
But it takes a bit of work to get there

[1/20/2025 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Then just use the fancy photoshop map as the main player map

[1/20/2025 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Some day I’d like to make a canonical hexmap that would be easier to edit for things like regions, climate, working out changing borders/history, etc

[1/20/2025 1:39 PM] Deciusmus
Right. I’ve added some detail to various sembara maps directly in the pngs in obsidian

[1/20/2025 2:04 PM] Deciusmus
Are you guys still in NH? We still need to get maple syrup and the camera for Z from you

[1/20/2025 2:33 PM] Deciusmus
(I guess you are probably driving or hiking or something, anyway.... back to Taelgar...) As I try to collate a lot of the history post-Downfall, there are some gaps that keep coming up as "undefined / undetermined" which make telling a cohesive narrative somewhat difficult. Some of the gaps are irrelevant or intentional, but not all of them.

[1/20/2025 2:36 PM] Deciusmus
In particular, I think you can divide up the Drankorian world into basically six areas: (a) the core coastal plains including Drankor itself (b) the Istaros river valley (c) the Nevos Sea/Illoria/Apporia (d) the near Green Sea shores: South Cymea/eastern mountains/southern Cymea - the whole sorta ill-defined section along the south western Green Sea (e) Greater Sembara (f) the west coast

[1/20/2025 2:39 PM] Deciusmus
Of those (a), (b), and (e) are pretty well defined, at least in terms of the influence of Drankor on post-Drankorian history

[1/20/2025 2:40 PM] Deciusmus
(c) and (f) have numerous open questions, but the very big picture is pretty well defined (although there are some questions as to when Illoria is conqueored by Drankor or really if it canonicaly should have been?)

[1/20/2025 2:41 PM] Deciusmus
(d) is a gaping blank area in the history

[1/20/2025 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I was driving then doing errands

[1/20/2025 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
We are back now

[1/20/2025 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is hard to make up a history

[1/20/2025 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Taelgar history, i think the problem with (d) is that, in general, the modern day details don't really exist either

[1/20/2025 2:51 PM] Deciusmus
we just got home from eating lunch in davis but I might swing by later

[1/20/2025 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
if you want to get stuff you can swing by whenever

[1/20/2025 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
we have some brainstorming notes, i believe, that attempt to explain why drankor expanded north and west, but not really east very far, since the geography is a bit atypical for an empire in some sense

[1/20/2025 2:53 PM] Deciusmus
yeah there is a lot of brainstorming notes that I haven't fully looked through

[1/20/2025 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i think from a worldbuilding perspective, the stuff east of the mountains east of drankor is canonically 'not Drankorian' but beyond that it is a bit of a blank slate, intentionally so

[1/20/2025 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
a good chunk of southern part of that circle was rostaure

[1/20/2025 2:58 PM] Deciusmus
Everything to the east of that circle is "intentionally poorly defined"

[1/20/2025 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[1/20/2025 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
but i guess this leaves (d) as kind of a big hole that could use filling, since that is west of those mountains

[1/20/2025 2:58 PM] Deciusmus
Right the area I'm talking about is this yellow circle:

[1/20/2025 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
no idea what is there now, though. presumably wilderness

[1/20/2025 2:59 PM] Deciusmus
to the west and north (with a few exceptions around Cymea) is fairly well defined

[1/20/2025 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
basically the entire north shore of that weird bay

[1/20/2025 3:00 PM] Deciusmus
we had a lot of talk earlier about a huge Pantal/Everglades inland swamp, but I think that was to the east of the circle

[1/20/2025 3:00 PM] Deciusmus
?

[1/20/2025 3:00 PM] Deciusmus
is rostaure meant to be another surival of the big pre-downfall elves? or a new foundation

[1/20/2025 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
never decided

[1/20/2025 3:01 PM] Deciusmus
I think the theory is that most of that coastline along the green sea (between the mountain ranges) would have been empty land post-Downfall

[1/20/2025 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
but were east of the mountains, anyway

[1/20/2025 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the big lizardfolk swamps became the southern green sea after the downfall

[1/20/2025 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yeah

[1/20/2025 3:03 PM] Deciusmus
but that's in the "intentionally blank space" out east

[1/20/2025 3:03 PM] Deciusmus
In a bunch of the green sea brainstorming we had discussed the fact that there is no large swampland on Taelgar, and I think were considering something south of the "mariener trade peninusla" as having survived

[1/20/2025 3:04 PM] Deciusmus
In fact, it is really only the red circle here that is poorly defined:

[1/20/2025 3:05 PM] Deciusmus
the blue circle becomes Isingue

[1/20/2025 3:05 PM] Deciusmus
the squiggly yellow presumably never recovers from the plague. Although it isn't clear to me where the proto-Dunmari were or came from or went to

[1/20/2025 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
early on, i had the dunmari migration from undetermined homeland split, with some going ??? (variously, what we later called MTP or the red circle), and the rest continuing west to Dunmar

[1/20/2025 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
it's never really fit with the vibe of Dunmar for there to have been a second branch of the Dunmari so close - it really only works if they are far/distant/lost somehow

[1/20/2025 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
it

[1/20/2025 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
although the split is canonical, i've increasingly felt it doesn't really make sense for the other part of the dunmari to have settled so close to Dunmar (e.g, red circle), separated only from Dunmar by Isingue (which is hardly a barrier)

[1/20/2025 3:09 PM] Deciusmus
canonically the split was in the headwaters of that river that divides the yellow and red areas, right?

[1/20/2025 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
that seems more logical

[1/20/2025 3:09 PM] Deciusmus
So would it make sense for the dunmari homeland to be "out east" and after the split some of them went back towards the homeland?

[1/20/2025 3:10 PM] Deciusmus
But actually having the Dunmari homeland way out east simplifies alot of the Drankorian cultural history, as the Dunmari can just "appear" from nowhere basically, they were either on the fringes of Drankor or just far enough away that Drankor was only a legend

[1/20/2025 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
it is not clearly determined, actually

[1/20/2025 3:11 PM] Deciusmus
the other question that came up on the dunmari migration is... were there any drankorians still in the coastal plain they were riding into? or is this meant to all be plague-scarred and depopulated?

[1/20/2025 3:11 PM] Deciusmus
story/whatever

[1/20/2025 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
the traditional three great rivers of Dunmar are the Hara, Kharja, and Mahar (Istaros), and the country is more or less founded on the banks of the Kharja. but the split could happen either at the Istaros (Mahar) or an eastern tributary

[1/20/2025 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
re: drankorians - it is not necesarily clear how true the religious history of the dunmari has to be.

[1/20/2025 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
but the vibe of the founding myth is supposed to be: - dunmari ride, driven by their gods, into what is basically a dying land. exactly how/why the land is dying is not stated, but presumably an aftereffect of the plague - jeevali performs great miracle to heal the land, makes everything better, dies, is reborn - the dunmari kill / drive out everyone who was living there, saying the gods saved the land for them

[1/20/2025 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so the implication is that some people may have survived. or, possibly, it was undead, or plague demons, or ???

[1/20/2025 3:17 PM] Deciusmus
Right. So a canonical way of putting it might be: Shortly after the fall of Drankor, a new people, the Dunmari, sweep west, from an undetermined homeland somewhere east of the Drankorian sphere of influence. These Dunmari, speaking a unique language and worshipping their own gods, rapidly establish a new homeland - that they claim their gods have given to them - across the coastal plains * Whatever they are displacing - surviving humans? undead? plague demons? - is not clear, but by (XXX date) the sweap of land from (X) to (Y) is clearly Dunmari

[1/20/2025 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah the vibe is supposed to be somewhat like spread of islam right after the death of muhammad - very quick

[1/20/2025 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
the founding is DR 1171 - DR 1173, roughly, and the dunmar probably expand to the modern "Dunmari Basin" plus some of the area stretching east to the Mahar (modern day Xurkhaz) within 10 years

[1/20/2025 3:23 PM] Deciusmus
but isingue and dunmar are presumably neighbors

[1/20/2025 3:23 PM] Deciusmus
right, I think the exact borders here don't matter, as it is distrubted again with the Great War

[1/20/2025 3:23 PM] Deciusmus
in the historical framework doc I'm working on I have the fall of Drankor being ~15 years, and had dunmars founding as part of that (short) era

[1/20/2025 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
the exact borders are a little vague because it is not clear exactly what is happening with Isingue at this time, and how far south it expands, etc

[1/20/2025 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
the vibe in the pre-great-war dunmari history is that they thrive on trade passing from isingue to chardon

[1/20/2025 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah in the high school maps we had that (with old names)

[1/20/2025 3:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the fall of drankor era is probably longer than 15 years. i mean, the immediate fall of drankor is very, very fast, basically just a single day when cha'mutte traps apollyon and unleashes the plague

[1/20/2025 3:26 PM] Deciusmus
I guess it is probably more like a hundred years of unclear disruptions and resettlements

[1/20/2025 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the two things in my head here are: (1) the plague doesn't immediately curse the land. the city of drankor is haunted by the plague dead, and hard to survive in, but you have a kind of creeping corruption spread out from drankor, and over the next few years crops fail, cities die and are abandoned, etc (2) Apollyon was already in the process of centralizing a lot of things, collecting knowledge to himself, trying to suppress Mos Numena, etc. but his power base is very central, driven by the fact that all the important people in drankor are magically under his control. so there is already some tension between the center and the periphery.

[1/20/2025 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
so i think this could lead to a bunch of chaos for a while. you have refugees fleeing north and west and east; maybe Sembaran/Cymea declare themselves a new Drankorian Empire for a time but it breaks down / falls apart for various reasons (not the least of which might be the loss of important magical knowledge - e.g., Drankor helped keep things together with teleportation circles, but these are clearly lost magic now)

[1/20/2025 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
we have some scattered dates - the First Duke of Sembara in 1142; the founding of Dunmar in 1171, - the suggest a kind of resurgence really not until the mid 1100s at the earliest

[1/20/2025 3:33 PM] Deciusmus
right.

[1/20/2025 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
there is also a possibility for supernatural / magical events to come into play here

[1/20/2025 3:34 PM] Deciusmus
(drankor falls in 5192)

[1/20/2025 3:34 PM] Deciusmus
its 5304 not 5204

[1/20/2025 3:34 PM] Deciusmus
partly, I just did the math wrong and thought it was canonically immediately after the plague

[1/20/2025 3:36 PM] Deciusmus
but it makes sense to say basically 5192 - 5300 is "the fall of Drankor" and a time of chaos, etc where we don't really try to define events per se. I don't see a ton of value in making up a lot of events in the chaos speculatively, although it is a good time period to place some kind of odd catastrophy or magical problem or whatever

[1/20/2025 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
no

[1/20/2025 3:37 PM] Deciusmus
is the idea that the northerns landed first in Iloria important to keep as canon?

[1/20/2025 3:38 PM] Deciusmus
or at least, part southerner

[1/20/2025 3:38 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. maybe Illoria is really Southerner

[1/20/2025 3:38 PM] Deciusmus
I think there is more flexibility to develop Illoria if we leave it unclear where exactly the first northeners landed

[1/20/2025 4:56 PM] Deciusmus
nope, I was going to do the same

[1/20/2025 4:56 PM] rsulfuratus
added this chat to obsidian just based on copy/paste - if you have a fancier way to do it feel free to replace

[1/20/2025 4:59 PM] Deciusmus
I'm trying something a little bit different, which is to document (a) the rules - i.e. the established background of the migrations from Hkar (b) the existing cultures (c) the explicit blank spaces

[1/20/2025 4:59 PM] Deciusmus
in the interest of "finishing" something I've switched from the grand sweep of history to trying to clean up a bunch of the notes on human cultures into a cohesive background outline.

[1/20/2025 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm trying to finish the top-level cosmology tonight, just have some plane of souls and land of the dead clean up to do, but also this raises some open questions. is your idea that open questions pages should be relatively "big", that is, a series of cosmology-related open questions on one page, or should it be more narrow, e.g. a separate page for specific questions about the actual metaphysics of souls, vs the metaphysics of the land of the dead, etc

[1/20/2025 5:03 PM] Deciusmus
I've only really thought about it in the context of the history page, which is really one big page

[1/20/2025 5:03 PM] Deciusmus
I'm not sure

[1/20/2025 5:04 PM] Deciusmus
It is easy to link to h1/h2 headings though, so I might be inclined to just have a one or two open questions pages and link to headings as needed

[1/20/2025 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm going to start with a big page but if you see an obvious / sensible way to break it up, i don't have strong feelings

[1/20/2025 5:09 PM] Deciusmus
random idea: what do you think of Mawar not being founded by northerners at all (at least, not primarily) but by a second set of refugees from the downfall who didn't end up in Drankor?

[1/20/2025 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i like mawar a lot as a place and i'm kind of tempted to leave it blank for now, since it is a reasonable place i might want to set a campaign in in the future

[1/20/2025 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Mawar has always been a bad fit for a northerner origin, IMO, but i haven't developed its history in detail in large part because so much of the history of the west is a bit of a blank slate

[1/20/2025 5:12 PM] Deciusmus
what I wrote in the canonical human cultures update I am working on is: ### Mawar The [[Mawakel Peninsula]] is home to a unique people worshipping their own version of [[Mos Numena]] and with their own unique language. The cultural derivation of these people is not clear, although many other documents assume Northern/Drankorian blend. Other possibilities could work, including a second set of Downfall Refugees or a intermixing of a unique pantheonic culture with Drankorian culture,

[1/20/2025 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
there is actually a semi-developed ancient history there about elemental cults from one of the mawar adventures that i never typed up

[1/20/2025 5:14 PM] Deciusmus
is the emerald bay coast of Apporia best though of as part of the Nevos Sea/Illorian cultural context? or is own thing?

[1/20/2025 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
i never made any decisions about anything not on this map

[1/20/2025 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/rsulfuratus/2033_1_1_image.png._D-FNccYue.png)

[1/20/2025 5:18 PM] Deciusmus
there is a bunch of stuff about th Umbral Covenant, and the pirates of Illoria, and the War of the Dark Rift

[1/20/2025 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a bit of a complex history here, not sure how much is actually in obsidian vs secrets

[1/20/2025 5:19 PM] Deciusmus
that is a nice map you should add it to the approia page

[1/20/2025 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I am pretty sure I intentionally phrased this as in-world lore in case I changed my mind about the original settlement of Apporia: "According to the records of the Chardonian Empire, the Apporian Peninsula was originally settled by the Drankorians, who originally constructed the [[Old Chardon Canal]] and established a series of maritime bases on the [[Gulf of Chardon]] and the [[Nevos Sea]], although never reached the western coast or the interior. "

[1/20/2025 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
*intentionally

[1/20/2025 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I think from a human cultures point of view, you have a general Apporia / Illoria / Nevos Sea "vibe" that is very maritime, with influences from Venice, Genoa, and the Age of Sail. but lots of the exact history is blank, some parts intentioanlly

[1/20/2025 5:25 PM] Deciusmus
for "defined" what I have so far is: Mawar Chardon North-coastal Apporia

[1/20/2025 5:25 PM] Deciusmus
Really though what I'm trying to do is round out the list of "known" cultures in the west coast as between: intentionally blank defined * some canonical details but not entirely defined

[1/20/2025 5:26 PM] Deciusmus
plus "north bay/north of Voltara"

[1/20/2025 5:26 PM] Deciusmus
for intentionally blank I have: Interior and west coast of Apporia

[1/20/2025 5:26 PM] Deciusmus
for some canonical details but not entirely defined I have "northern realms" "nevos sea/illoria"

[1/20/2025 5:27 PM] Deciusmus
I'm mostly just not sure if east coast of Apporia is "intentionally blank" or "nevos sea/illoria"

[1/20/2025 5:29 PM] Deciusmus
no need to decide now

[1/20/2025 5:29 PM] Deciusmus
right so it isn't its own thing - it is either part of nevos sea or it is part of "potential apporia weirdness"

[1/20/2025 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
And not sure I want to decide now

[1/20/2025 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
But I’m pretty undecided between those two options

[1/20/2025 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
My feeling is that another standard human culture doesn’t fit there. It is either something maigcal/weird that explicitly makes it hard for illorian culture to expand there, or it is illorian.

[1/21/2025 9:48 AM] Deciusmus
I'm fairly busy today but I do have an afternoon meeting that is mostly other people talking but that I have to attend in case someone has a question for me, during which I might do Taelgar instead of work... My goal was to try to produce a couple of maps that outlined, for the "post Downfall", "height of Drankor" and "pre Great War": (a) where canonically various human and non-humans were (b) where the "intentional blank spots" are I've recently been playing around with Lightroom Classic, so I have temporarily switched my Adobe plan to the one that has Photoshop... So I was wondering if this would be easier if I just had the raw map Photoshop file?

[1/21/2025 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
it is about 300 Mb, so can't go in git repo

[1/21/2025 9:49 AM] Deciusmus
My assumption is there are no critical secrets in there and it might be worth putting in the git repo?

[1/21/2025 9:50 AM] rsulfuratus
(via Adobe)

[1/21/2025 9:50 AM] rsulfuratus
i can probably share it with you though

[1/21/2025 9:52 AM] Deciusmus
you could just use Git LFS

[1/21/2025 9:54 AM] Deciusmus
[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage "https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage")

[1/21/2025 9:54 AM] Deciusmus
might be more of a pain that it is worth though; anywaydon't have more time right now

[1/21/2025 9:59 AM] Deciusmus
yeah that worked, it just popped up in my creative cloud notifications

[1/21/2025 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
[https://photoshop.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:1a0f772b-9a25-4c61-83b1-c1d0e1013cb1](https://photoshop.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:1a0f772b-9a25-4c61-83b1-c1d0e1013cb1 "https://photoshop.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:1a0f772b-9a25-4c61-83b1-c1d0e1013cb1")

[1/21/2025 10:00 AM] rsulfuratus
measurement scale is 84 pixels = 50 miles

[1/21/2025 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure if that is shared or you have to set yourself

[1/21/2025 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
i added a continent scale hex layer (24 miles edge to edge). there are probably too many hexes for it to be straightforward to label them on this scale. however, each degree latitude is ~3.5 hexes, which is a useful scale, and it makes translating from smaller hex-scale maps to the main map a lot easier

[1/21/2025 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
now that I have the basic illustrator/photoshop interactions figured out I could add thicker lines to make a regular grid that could be labeled. the whole world is 14400 pixels square. each existing grid is 210 pixels long, 161 pixels tall

[1/21/2025 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
if I made 3x3 grids, we'd have 23 squares across and 30 squares tall, so could label top with letters and side with numbers to have a bunch of well-defined quadrants

[1/21/2025 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, updated with labels: each hex is 24 miles. each group of 24 miles is in a rectangle (~125 miles wide, ~96 miles high) each 3x3 arrangement of rectangles is labeled. if within each 3x3 grid we label the inner rectangles 1-9 (from top left to bottom right, so 1|2|3 (next row) 4|5|6 etc, then you can uniquely pinpoint each rectangle, e.g. Chardon is H13.1 and Drankor is L18.8

[1/21/2025 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
still you could label each column A-F, and then label the hexes 1-4 or 1-6, counting half-hexes as full

[1/21/2025 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
pinpointing the exact hex is trickier on this scale, because each rectangle of 24 hexes actually splits several because of the hex -> rectangle conversion. but each rectangle has a regular pattern of 6 columns of 4 hexes, it is just the 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns are 0.5 hex - hex - hex - hex - 0.5 hex

[1/21/2025 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
etc

[1/21/2025 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
then if you have: bigGrid.littleGrid.column-row you get: Chardon -> H13.1.B-5 Karawa -> J15.3.E-4

[1/21/2025 1:51 PM] Deciusmus
It would be really nice to have the text layers be Major Geographic | Minor Geographic | Major Settlement | Minor Settlement rather tha each text on its own layer

[1/21/2025 1:52 PM] rsulfuratus
you can't really do that in photoshop

[1/21/2025 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
however it is theoretically possible - if a huge pain - to create multiple text groups for different categories

[1/21/2025 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
it is possible that a photoshop expert might have a solution using some advanced tools but if you just merge the layers they are converted to a raster image and you can no longer edit the text

[1/21/2025 3:19 PM] Deciusmus
and with a bit less arrows and a bit more "here's where people and non-humans were", and with the map truncated to just the "known world"

[1/21/2025 3:19 PM] Deciusmus
I sadly had to actually mostly answer questions at my previous meeting, but now have a bit of dead time before my next thing, might try to muck around a bit with maps for real. What I'm trying to do is create a new version of [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J33KjvXeFYKkMonDmhBhv7rbleEsGksv/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J33KjvXeFYKkMonDmhBhv7rbleEsGksv/view "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J33KjvXeFYKkMonDmhBhv7rbleEsGksv/view") but without the spectualive stuff

[1/21/2025 3:20 PM] Deciusmus
is that worth trying to do in photoshop, in a new layer, or should I just export a base map and do it in a separate file?

[1/21/2025 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
either - it is easy enough to reimport if desired but i don't think photoshop layers are the right format for storing a bunch of these history maps

[1/21/2025 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i would just make sure we have the hexes in any export which makes it easy to realign with the main map or any future canonical hexmap

[1/21/2025 5:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I pushed an "open questions - campaigns" doc as if we are trying to get all the info into Obsidian it seems worthwhile to priotize canonical information over stuff that is probably or definitely not canonical (especially an issue for me as a good fraction of my stuff from 2019-2023 is in OneNote)

[1/21/2025 6:07 PM] Deciusmus
I pushed an update

[1/21/2025 6:28 PM] Deciusmus
also pushed a few soulstuff/land of dead thoughts

[1/21/2025 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at your comments on divine power in taelgar, perhaps easier to move to discord. i think the point about classification of magic into arcane/divine/primal is not so much about specific D&D classes, but about where on this spectrum things fall: (a) fey have clerics and divine magic works for fey similarly to humans; someone making a "fey cleric" character could reasonably be expected to think a little bit about what divine entity grants them power (b) fey have clerics that metaphysically / in-world access magic from the Plane of Creation, but not necessarily via the Material-Plane-Centric "divine powers grant miracles", suggesting an alternate route for diivine magic to manifest (c) fey don't have clerics. any player that wants to play a fey cleric would be assumed to be using the cleric mechanics to represent some other kind of in-world magic, and would be expected NOT to have a connection to a particular god or, put another way, do fey, in-world, pray to gods; pray in some strange fey way; or don't pray at all in any sense

[1/21/2025 7:34 PM] Deciusmus
(About to eat dinner but will be around for taelgar stuff a bit later)

[1/21/2025 7:54 PM] Deciusmus
Although I’m not sure that it is impossible for fey to pray to a god

[1/21/2025 7:54 PM] Deciusmus
I think it’s b or c

[1/21/2025 7:55 PM] rsulfuratus
right, i mean i think we've established pretty clearly that all kinds of things are possible and that at least some gods are not picky about who they get prayers from and grant prayers to

[1/21/2025 7:56 PM] Deciusmus
Right. I think the vibe of any inner plane creature praying to a god seems … non standard

[1/21/2025 7:56 PM] rsulfuratus
but i guess that is different from "there is fey religion"

[1/21/2025 7:57 PM] rsulfuratus
the original "children of the divine" logic actually got around this nicely by making fey/elementals/giants/dragons have a direct connection to the divine presence.

[1/21/2025 7:59 PM] Deciusmus
Right. Why does that have to be wrong though?

[1/21/2025 8:00 PM] Deciusmus
I mean I’m not sure if elementals have a soul on the plane of souls necessarily but if they don’t they should have some equivalent

[1/21/2025 8:01 PM] rsulfuratus
i kind of like the vibe that none of the speculation about the plane of souls in the in-world note is correct, but the hint from the fey idea of the dreamworld being the "real" plane of souls and the plane of souls being the echo ties into your suggestion as well

[1/21/2025 8:02 PM] Deciusmus
I also like the idea of preserving unique possibilities and contingencies rather than having a complete typology or everything is exactly in a neat box

[1/21/2025 8:02 PM] Deciusmus
I also like the vibe that none of them are precisely correct

[1/21/2025 8:03 PM] Deciusmus
But one question that seems relevant - did the riving create the plane of souls and the land of the dead? What was cosmology like before the riving?

[1/21/2025 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't clear to me at the moment

[1/21/2025 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
and dominated by arcane magical energy

[1/21/2025 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
so in that pre-Plane of Creation cosmology, the riving was effectively all the inner planes mixed together

[1/21/2025 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
the original concept of the riving pre-dates the invention of the plane of creation as a nexus for the Divine Presence

[1/21/2025 8:08 PM] rsulfuratus
the riving creates the Firstborn, pulls apart the inner planes, but it was never really resolved how the land of the dead / plane of souls / spiritual realms come into existence

[1/21/2025 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so that would imply the riving creates the land of the dead, but not the plane of souls which predates it

[1/21/2025 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i think i'm coming around to the idea that the plane of souls possibly always existed, and maybe the riving stretches the plane of souls into the astral plane and perhaps even creates the plane of creation as a home/embodiment of the divine presence, behind the wall of the land of the dead

[1/21/2025 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
(more in a bit if you are around, have to get Nathaniel to finish his homework)

[1/21/2025 8:20 PM] Deciusmus
(So back)

[1/21/2025 8:20 PM] Deciusmus
(Was cleaning but done)

[1/21/2025 8:23 PM] Deciusmus
I think the metaphysics might work better if we assume that at least the plane of souls existed forever.

[1/21/2025 8:29 PM] Deciusmus
That sets up this idea that whatever creation process existed during the riving the great wyrms and whatnot existed on the plane of souls. How that fragmented during the riving is canonically unclear but ultimately it means a fundamental divide between children of the riving - who get soul stuff “directly” - and after the riving - who get it from gods

[1/21/2025 8:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I think that makes sense. Want to let it sit a little but am going to update land of the dead tonight and will copy this discussion and update the open questions

[1/21/2025 8:36 PM] Deciusmus
So the only creatures that don't have access to divine magic are those that do not have soulstuff

[1/21/2025 8:36 PM] Deciusmus
There is a whole idea that could be explored about how the actual source of divine magic is soulstuff not anything else

[1/21/2025 8:37 PM] Deciusmus
but of course, what is ki powers except kenzo using the power of his soul on the plane of souls to generate magical effects?

[1/21/2025 8:37 PM] Deciusmus
for most "normal" species, their own "personal" soul stuff is not strong enough to generate magical effects

[1/21/2025 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah. Actually this could tie back into hkar - maybe part of the magic of hkar was kind of an upwelling of soulstuff somehow, so that personal soulstuff was enough for magic. At least in the early days

[1/21/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
Hence the desire to conquer Hkar, and the need to destroy it

[1/21/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe the whole thing with the void mind is it cannot create soulstuff, it can only try to shape soulstuff that escapes from the divine presence

[1/21/2025 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
Could also tie into undead, and why turn undead works, and why you cant have undead clerics but you can have undead mages

[1/21/2025 9:07 PM] Deciusmus
You'd extend the western gulf up along the sembaran rivers (making Embry, with its pre-downfall origin, originally a coastal city)

[1/21/2025 9:07 PM] Deciusmus
Totally different topic... but I was just messing around with the pre-Downfall situation, and it would actually work pretty well to have all of the major "Firstborn" races have massive civilizations that met at Ulrich Pass

[1/21/2025 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
Huh. I like that actually

[1/21/2025 9:21 PM] Deciusmus
it all converges on Ulrich

[1/21/2025 9:21 PM] Deciusmus
dark blue circle is dwarf

[1/21/2025 9:21 PM] Deciusmus
yellow is elf

[1/21/2025 9:21 PM] Deciusmus
green is the big swamp

[1/21/2025 9:21 PM] Deciusmus
light blue is green sea

[1/21/2025 9:21 PM] Deciusmus
Something like this:

[1/21/2025 9:22 PM] Deciusmus
the brown is northerner

[1/21/2025 9:22 PM] Deciusmus
the 4 grey circles are marniner settlements (well, one is tyrwinghan which might or might not be mariner)

[1/21/2025 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
it sets tyrwingha up as pretty unusual in some respects, which probably makes sense

[1/21/2025 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
i might tweak a few details but i like the basic idea

[1/21/2025 9:34 PM] Deciusmus
here's a slight different version - brown = human, yellow = elf, green = lizardfolk, blue = dwarf, light blue = green sea:

[1/21/2025 9:37 PM] Deciusmus
not really committed to the specific details, but the idea would be: (a) pretty much all of the core lands that will become drankorian heartland have no humans at the time Drankor expands into the lands. (b) Tyrwingha is odd (c) Embry was founded as a coastal city (d) the northern Cymeans were mariner and there might be a bit of a cultural divide between north, central, and south cymea

[1/21/2025 9:38 PM] Deciusmus
it also sets up south Cymea in particular as being the most purely drankorian-successor state around, as the west coast had all these scattered humans as did the east

[1/21/2025 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
so, a few things

[1/21/2025 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but in any case, the initial expansion - when an island dumps a few million or more people at the mouth of this river - is not war or even assimilation

[1/21/2025 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
(1) definitely more-or-less canon that the initial expansion up the istaros and across dunmar is into empty land. likely there is actually a degree of "drankorian + peronar magic restores the land that was devasted by the downfall", echoing perhaps a bit the "jeevali restores the land" although want to avoid that being a total cliche

[1/21/2025 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) i have a pretty clear - if vague - vision of cymea, and the main fault line is really northeast vs northwest vs south (will draw a map in a sec)

[1/21/2025 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
(3) embry as a coastal city on founding is interesting, but pratically wouldn't it then suffer a lot? i might what are the odds the waters recede exactly to leave it as a river port after the downfall

[1/21/2025 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm sure there is a way to square that circle but it feels a little too pat to me

[1/21/2025 9:47 PM] Deciusmus
it does feel that without some degree of magic of divine intervention, it is a little pat

[1/21/2025 9:48 PM] Deciusmus
yeah but that actually lines up perfectly with my map

[1/21/2025 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
this is super rough

[1/21/2025 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
re: cymea

[1/21/2025 9:49 PM] Deciusmus
(because we both drew it based on thehills, basically)

[1/21/2025 9:49 PM] Deciusmus
my brown circle of "old mariner" culture lines up with your green circle

[1/21/2025 9:50 PM] Deciusmus
right, yeah, I said it badly

[1/21/2025 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay, i guess i just think of both green + red as 'north cymea" but yeah the maps line up

[1/21/2025 9:51 PM] Deciusmus
I mean, I was thinking something more like:

[1/21/2025 9:52 PM] Deciusmus
just saying when I said "north" / "central" / "south" that is what I was thinking

[1/21/2025 9:52 PM] Deciusmus
I mean, I like your view, not saying I am suggesting changing it or anything

[1/21/2025 9:52 PM] Deciusmus
but I don't have any particlarly clear thoughts

[1/21/2025 9:53 PM] Deciusmus
either way, I wasn't really planning on commiting to anything in particular here

[1/21/2025 9:54 PM] Deciusmus
when drankorians land

[1/21/2025 9:54 PM] Deciusmus
The main idea is that there were no meaningful human cultures in the red circle:

[1/21/2025 9:55 PM] Deciusmus
well, yeah

[1/21/2025 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
right - although also remember a good chunk of the land west of the yuvanti mountains is ocean at this point, and the mountains don't exist

[1/21/2025 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
not saying

[1/21/2025 9:56 PM] Deciusmus
?

[1/21/2025 9:56 PM] Deciusmus
is that the end of the campaign big reveal

[1/21/2025 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
(that will be an interesting story when you finally figure out what actually happened when cha'mutte died)

[1/21/2025 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
might be the destruction of the crown level 20 one shot

[1/21/2025 9:59 PM] Deciusmus
which is agnostic as to where the non-human empires were

[1/21/2025 9:59 PM] Deciusmus
here is the map I've playing with:

[1/21/2025 9:59 PM] Deciusmus
yeah

[1/21/2025 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
going back to cymea - i think that actually sets up the mysterious south cymea as actually perhaps the best "byzantine equivalent" post-drankor survival of empire

[1/21/2025 10:00 PM] Deciusmus
red is "no one"

[1/21/2025 10:00 PM] Deciusmus
but black circles are northern blue circles are mariner or mixed marnier/northern green is dunmari although canonically unplaced as long as it is outside the red circle

[1/21/2025 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
the other spot that has always been a bit of trouble is the yeraad river valley, which is notably blank on this map

[1/21/2025 10:01 PM] Deciusmus
tywinghan is misdrawn as blue

[1/21/2025 10:01 PM] Deciusmus
missing a couple of black circles for the northern migrationthat is well established

[1/21/2025 10:01 PM] Deciusmus
black question marks are who knows

[1/21/2025 10:01 PM] Deciusmus
blue question markers as "unknown but probably marnier" if anyone

[1/21/2025 10:03 PM] Deciusmus
although actually probably the illorians are the first people they encountered

[1/21/2025 10:03 PM] Deciusmus
Right. It is the first people drankor would encounter going west, but who is there? well-established northerners? no one? lizardfolk? an ancient curse? Illorians? the weird people who end up in the apporian highlands after being driven out by drankor?

[1/21/2025 10:04 PM] Deciusmus
given the idea of darba as a fort - although maybe that is a fort against the giants or whatever, not humans at all

[1/21/2025 10:05 PM] Deciusmus
I'm not sure it matters what was in the Yeraad River Valley pre-Drankor. The western expansion is already established as being fairly conquest/brutual compared to eastern expansion. So it is easy enough to say that from the perspective of modern day Yeraad, Drankor wiped the slate clean

[1/21/2025 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the darba fort is against ~ something dangerous ~ in the Nevos Sea area, not humans. this is in 377, more than 200 years before the western conquest begins

[1/21/2025 10:06 PM] Deciusmus
That preserves the possibility that it was a dragon or giants or an undead kingdom or something. maybe the western expansion was brutual because of whatever was in the yeraad river valley

[1/21/2025 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
that's true

[1/21/2025 10:07 PM] Deciusmus
Right. Could also be Illorians potentially

[1/21/2025 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, maybe. it probably doesn't matter too much until someone sets a campaign in illoria / apporia

[1/21/2025 10:08 PM] Deciusmus
I mean, not saying any of this is necessarily true or good, just saying, it could be anything

[1/21/2025 10:08 PM] Deciusmus
or an anti-magical school of thought

[1/21/2025 10:08 PM] Deciusmus
Maybe the Illorians were a second group of refugees from a rival school of magical thought or something

[1/21/2025 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the main thing is this is not a fort established in support of the advancing army, darba is originally a defensive position, and naval focused (the fact that it is the one good dunmari harbor is basically because the harbor isn't dunmari)

[1/21/2025 10:10 PM] Deciusmus
Right. From the perspective of the historical framework, all that matters is (a) the western frontier is along the Darba/Myrani Gap line and it stays that way for a while (b) when it changes, it changes fast and (c) from the perspective of post-Drankorian history, whatever was in the Mryani/Yeerad area is gone enough that it doesn't meaningfully impact post-Drankorian development

[1/21/2025 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
(although it might not be dunmari any more depending on how the negotiations with karnas and chardon turn out)

[1/21/2025 10:11 PM] rsulfuratus
in the modern day, all i know about this place is the border area is rough and dangerous and notorious for kobold banditry

[1/21/2025 10:11 PM] Deciusmus
Or if it does, it is via a small, localized thing, not a major cultural factor

[1/21/2025 10:11 PM] rsulfuratus
yes

[1/21/2025 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
so maybe it was kobolds all along

[1/21/2025 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
(i added the divine power chat to obsidian but not any of this history stuff)

[1/21/2025 10:15 PM] Deciusmus
I'madding it then need to go to bed

[1/21/2025 10:33 PM] Deciusmus
oops, was just cleaning up a few things before bed and was messing around with the obsidian git thing and accidentally committed a bunch of unstaged changes I didn't mean to commit, mostly images of people in the DM folder + some rewrites of regions + human culture I wasn't sure about. If you see anything weird, it is revertable, but its probably easier to just carry forward, I don't think the regions + culture rewrites were anything bad just not projects I was planning on necessarily finishing soon

[1/22/2025 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
finished the top-level multiverse pages: - everything is now written in-world, with some different scholarly ideas - most pages have a campaign none section at the end for DM notes - planes are set to [place], groups of planes are set to [background] - everything has dm_notes: none I did not tag check/mike but would be happy with commets if you have any

[1/22/2025 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
taking a break from cosmology to work on check/tim stuff. kate stayed up in Alexandria because she is taking an online class in London time zone (so 4 am to 12 noon roughly) and it seemed less disruptive, so i'm probably going to work on taelgar most of evening now that I've mostly wrapped up actual work

[1/22/2025 6:28 PM] Deciusmus
A few comments as I read.... first, this is all really nice. It is a great format for this kind of topic, and makes me want to do the same sort of thing for some of the history (although that is much harder, but maybe doable for pre-downfall without too much work)

[1/22/2025 6:31 PM] Deciusmus
as an aside, the implication of that is that gods cannot in fact do anything at all, without someone's soul to carry the miracle

[1/22/2025 6:31 PM] Deciusmus
specific comments.. Land of the Dead: * this sentence "it is generally accepted that the Divine cannot act freely in the world, and that it is through the conduit across the Land of the Dead provided by souls that most miracles occur. " reads a bit unclear to me. I think you are trying to capture the metaphyiscal idea that divine magic goes: God -> plane of souls -> material realm?

[1/22/2025 6:32 PM] Deciusmus
that is a very Chaldonian idea, not sure if it has to be Taelgar canon, but if it is, this might be a good place to state it. If it isn't, it might be better to be a bit vaguer?

[1/22/2025 6:33 PM] Deciusmus
Second: It is a bit unsatisfying to have the "see more" on gidari be mostly the same text, but I assume that is because there is no motivation to make the Giardi page better right now

[1/22/2025 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
my intention is not the strong implication of "gods cannot do anything without someone's soul to carry the miracle", but rather the weak implication of "it takes a lot of effort to directly act in the world and it is a lot easier to pour though the "channel" opened by a soul" (the example being Jeevali literally expended enough power in some sense to become un-divine to cleanse Dunmar of the plague curse - so it is not that these miracles don't happen but that this sort of things is costly for gods, potentially "deadly" in a sense)

[1/22/2025 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I do have more notes on Gidari (dm_notes: important), just haven't updated that page yet

[1/22/2025 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
(but all in onenote)

[1/22/2025 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
ideally I'd like to do it in a similar way, with rumors and descriptions from various cultures, just haven't gotten to it yet. most of my invention aroudn the gidari is from the kenzo solo but i do have a lot of notes on at least one, potentially uncommon, "kind" of gidari

[1/22/2025 6:40 PM] rsulfuratus
New text I think captures better: "While most theologians reject the idea that the Journey of Souls is simply the mechanical process of [[Soulstuff]] diffusing across a cosmological barrier, it is generally accepted that Divine power flows far more easily though the channels provided by souls, and that for deities to manifest the power of creation directly in the Material Plane often carries a great cost. Thus, it is through the conduit across the Land of the Dead provided by souls that most miracles occur, although there are [[Founding of Dunmar|dramatic exceptions]]. "

[1/22/2025 6:41 PM] Deciusmus
maybe "it is through their connection to the soulstuff on the Plane of Souls that most miracles occur?

[1/22/2025 6:42 PM] Deciusmus
or are you trying to avoid mentioning plane of souls?

[1/22/2025 6:43 PM] Deciusmus
I think what wasn't super clear to me is what is meant by the "conduit across the land of the dead". It implies that there is some connection between a divinity and soulstuff, right?

[1/22/2025 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes

[1/22/2025 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
No

[1/22/2025 6:53 PM] Deciusmus
Is psionics really necessarily powered by a strong connection to the plane of souls?

[1/22/2025 6:56 PM] Deciusmus
I might rephrase that first bullet as something like: Although there is no specific definition of psoinics in Taelgar, any magical effects that represent a magical "inner strength" (such as monk focus, or certain types of psionics) would likely be a result of a particular "strength of soul" on the Plane of Souls. While there are not really any direct mechanical consequences of this, for flavor reasons it is worth keeping in mind that these magics are quite distinct from arcane magic or divine miracles. The flavor should tend towards drawing on the power of the soulstuff that resides within you

[1/22/2025 6:58 PM] Deciusmus
As an aside, I wonder if a background page on "the typology of magic" would be useful

[1/22/2025 6:58 PM] Deciusmus
Specifically, I've been running the psionic effects that Viepuck generates via his patron as very much NOT "plane of souls".

[1/22/2025 7:00 PM] Deciusmus
I think the Metaphysics of Souls page is probably obsolete almost entirely...

[1/22/2025 7:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah that makes sense. Obviously far realm psionics is different from eg soul knife rogue

[1/22/2025 7:06 PM] Deciusmus
I pushed a few typo fixes and whatnot but overall I love it all

[1/22/2025 7:12 PM] Deciusmus
I'm going to eat, but I moved the "Metaphysics of Souls" to background with the idea that really, if we cleaned up the "Traditions Around Death" then traditions around death + the land of dead/plane of souls/soulstuff pages would replace it

[1/22/2025 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
working on spiritual realms, now, and i'm actually not sure whether incorporeal gods should, in general, have planes. maybe this is what the original high school conception of the "all the gods are just aspects of the Divine Presence" idea means. Incorporeal Gods are, actually, manifestations of pure Soulstuff and to the extent they have "homes" it is the Plane of Creation itself. this might actually simplify some things: - where the souls of people who worship tanshi or kestavo go - the fact that we've never really had any lore about human "heavens" despite there being a lot of lore about non-human heavens - the actual metaphysical distinction between incorporal and embodied gods

[1/22/2025 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
the only thing that has ever been made up and canonically exists that is associated with a human god is Shakun's Realm, and that is a distinctly unusual place. it is not a place where human souls go in the afterlife, it is basically a trap for the enemies of Dunmar. so it could easily be an echo realm or a demiplane or whatever, much more like Cha'mutte's shadow realms than an Outer Plane.

[1/22/2025 8:17 PM] Deciusmus
Hrm…

[1/22/2025 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
part of my thinking is that, if something has not come up in 5 years of running games in Taelgar, and also has not needed to be developed for any of the many extensive discussions of religion, maybe there is a reason

[1/22/2025 8:19 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah.

[1/22/2025 8:20 PM] Deciusmus
My only real hesitation is that it feels like it kinda blurs the lines between different religious traditions in a way I’m not totally sold on

[1/22/2025 8:20 PM] Deciusmus
I actually think it does solve a bunch of issues

[1/22/2025 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i did at one point long ago develop a Dunmari heaven (this is the Arkaash stub) but i never really liked it so never used it in game

[1/22/2025 8:22 PM] Deciusmus
But I agree the idea of some kind of Mos Numena heaven seems off

[1/22/2025 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. Greek gods

[1/22/2025 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the D&D-useful verions of mythological heavens all draw much more heavily from historical religions that conceptualized gods as much more directly interacting with humans, but being much less powerful overall than Taelgar gods

[1/22/2025 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so even in standard D&D models of cosmology is it never exactly clear where the gods actually live

[1/22/2025 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
but also, outer planes in D&D are traditionally associated with alignment, not specific gods

[1/22/2025 8:28 PM] Deciusmus
Maybe it does work for them to exist in some sort of nebolous "plane of creation"

[1/22/2025 8:28 PM] Deciusmus
So where do they exist?

[1/22/2025 8:28 PM] Deciusmus
Right. I think the main tension is probably around the "pantheonic" gods like the Dunmari gods and Kaikeka, who both feel like entities that should have some kind of 'real' existence

[1/22/2025 8:30 PM] rsulfuratus
people come back from the dead, and can describe their vague memories of the land of the dead, and brave/foolhardy adventurers can plane shift there

[1/22/2025 8:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I would propose this is maybe something that, in-world, should be completely unknown and perhaps unknowable, and therefore unanswerable out-of-game

[1/22/2025 8:31 PM] Deciusmus
That's not a bad idea; it actually ties together nicely with the divine spark and the nature of the Divine Presence all being interlated with what incorporeal gods are

[1/22/2025 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but if anyone resurrected after ~10 days doesn't remember anything about what happened after they were on the plane of the dead, and you can't plane shift to the realms of the incorporeal gods, then in some sense they don't really ever need to exist as places that can be described

[1/22/2025 8:34 PM] rsulfuratus
then, you have the "spiritual realms' which are just "anything made of soulstuff"

[1/22/2025 8:34 PM] Deciusmus
(and to add, defining what those things are as some sort of unknowa=nable mystery)

[1/22/2025 8:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it also clarifies a bit the basic idea of the outer planes, although it doesn't necessarily answer all the questions about timing. basically, you have the realms of the embodied gods, created potentially during the riving for the Firstborn who are given physical form and presence by the power of Divine Creation

[1/22/2025 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
there doesn't have to be any unified creation story for the rest of the outer planes, and they don't all necessarily need to be "evils of humanity"

[1/22/2025 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean we already settled on that basic idea but it was still a little anchored to the "human belief -> outer planes"

[1/22/2025 8:38 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah I like that

[1/22/2025 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
copied this discussion to obsidian. might put aside spiritual realms for tonight and think on it a bit.

[1/22/2025 9:17 PM] Deciusmus
I'm taking a stab at an in-world "Mythic Age" page. I really like the cosmology pages and I think the in-world style with Campaign Notes would work quite well from some of the early history

[1/22/2025 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
glad you like them. i think the style is really good for background lore like this. i was thinking for history, a more viable approach might be to extent and develop the thing I started to do with Cavarrio's Chronicles of Drankor. basically just focus on a single in-world scholarly secondary source

[1/22/2025 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd also like to do in-world lore pages for non-playable species at some point. that might be my next project after cosmology

[1/22/2025 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
(at least for major overview pages)

[1/23/2025 12:38 PM] Deciusmus
For history since the downfall I think that might make sense. For something like the Riving or the pre Riving time or the Downfall itself, the cosmology style is probably better

[1/23/2025 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
just pushed a rewrite/update of regions in taelgar

[1/23/2025 1:05 PM] Deciusmus
I'm reading that. I think you are right that moving Vostok + Cymean to Western Green Sea would make sense; I also think you wanted Cymea to be somewhat intentionally blank? to preserve for a potential future campaign or miniseries? It feels like the kind of place that should be developed for a larger purpose than "passing through?

[1/23/2025 1:18 PM] Deciusmus
I wonder if it would make more sense to consider: (a)

[1/23/2025 1:20 PM] Deciusmus
Or even actually whether it would make more sense to get rid pf #4 and add it to Western Green Sea

[1/23/2025 1:20 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. #1 - Greater Dunmar, basically the dunarmi basin + Myrani Gap up to the Kharia #2 Istaros River Valley, extending as far south as Drankor/Desoluation Around Drankor #3 "Eastern Drankor" basically the area south of the east branch of the Mahar #4 "South Cymea" basically east branch of Mahar north to the Cymean mountains

[1/23/2025 1:21 PM] Deciusmus
The border is unclear, but I think it is canonical that there is basically some line that divides the plagueland from "remaining human civilization" on the shores of the western green sea, and south cymea + cymea are good to at least somewhat treat together

[1/23/2025 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Cymea yes I think you are right, I had said something like that in the past (worth saving for an actual campaign to develop in detail)

[1/23/2025 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm in meetings until at least 2:30, but have a quick break between meeting 1 and meeting 2. but a few quick thoughts: (1) i think probably the undeveloped southern regions (south of the Shrev) fit better with 5 than with Greater Dunmar (2) i'm not sure that 5 and 6 need to exist separately? (3) Greater Dunmar should probably extend to the Mahar since historically e.g. Kharsan and other regions are central Dunmar; this also tracks basically the regions Dunmar Frontier traveled in. dividing like with 5/6 is "south of Xurkhaz, basically along the border of what is actively mapped. this distinguishes the Nashtkar, which is more rocky, from the high desert plateau of the Garamjala (4) south cymea does probably make sense to consider as part of Western Green Sea this however, leaves the plaguelands as basically its own region. maybe that should be merged with greater sembara? unclear to me

[1/23/2025 1:31 PM] Deciusmus
I have a meeting in a few min but I'll dump a proposed restructure here based on the above

[1/23/2025 2:43 PM] Deciusmus
my meetting is a bit pointless so I am drawing region lines..... a few questions Where does vostok go? options 1. All of Vostok in Greater Sembara 2. All of Vostok in West Green Sea 3. North Vostok in Greater Sembara, South Vostok in West Green Sea 4. North Vostok in "Ursk", South Vostok in West Green Sea 5. Noth Vostok in Ursk, South Vostok in Greaer Sembara

[1/23/2025 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think 4. the svinjo mountains are a pretty sharp dividing line

[1/23/2025 2:45 PM] Deciusmus
Question 3: Cymea - all in west green sea? or is western cymea in Greater Sembara?

[1/23/2025 2:45 PM] Deciusmus
Question 2: Irrla - east or west Green Sea ( I vote east, but am pretty undecided)

[1/23/2025 2:45 PM] Deciusmus
(my vote is 4, for what it is worth, or maybe 2 or 3)

[1/23/2025 2:47 PM] Deciusmus
are they? the in-game vibe I got was that the Vimfrost events and giants and whatnot had a non-trivial impact on this region:

[1/23/2025 2:48 PM] Deciusmus
they are obviously a significant barrier in game, but from an "invention" standpoint is that yellow highlighted area more connected to the Vargaldi/white dragons/etc or to the Zimka?

[1/23/2025 2:50 PM] Deciusmus
S = part of sembara U = "ursk" region, but actually perhaps a canonically "blank" area W = part of west green sea

[1/23/2025 2:50 PM] Deciusmus
although maybe actually something like this:

[1/23/2025 2:51 PM] Deciusmus
which might align pretty well with S = canonically "Zimka-influenced" U = canonically blank: could be Zimka, could be brand new, might be related to the Vargaldi, etc W = Skaer/Tollen/mariner

[1/23/2025 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
Vimfrost's War is kind of an opening gambit in the Great War

[1/23/2025 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that northern part of Vostok is such a blank slate it is not straightforward to put it in a region. Vimfrost also impacts Sembara, of course

[1/23/2025 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
*west of the mountains

[1/23/2025 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
but my sense is that the people on the east of the mountains are not generally putting themselves subservient to giants in order to gain protection from dragons

[1/23/2025 2:57 PM] Deciusmus
Right that is true;

[1/23/2025 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Western Green Sea then should be Skaer and Cymea

[1/23/2025 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess ultimately I'd put Vostok and Tollen in Sembara, and have the dividing line for Sembara vs Western Green Sea basically be the straights of Cymea. Vostok is not generally a mariner culture so they look more inward anyway

[1/23/2025 2:59 PM] Deciusmus
right, which is fine, the goal of regions is really mostly to organize where blank spots are and such not to erect walls

[1/23/2025 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd put all of Cymea (west, "main", south) in Western Green Sea, even though it introduces some cross-region development w/r/t Tollen

[1/23/2025 2:59 PM] Deciusmus
Ok, that works

[1/23/2025 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
with this stuff moved to western green sea, i'd move irrla to eastern green sea. i think it works as the western edge of the "east" more than the eastern edge of the "west", if that makes sense

[1/23/2025 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
that still leaves the plaguelands isolated as the only thing in a region that is basically the upper istaros. although perhaps orenlas fits in the upper istaros. actually, you could move xurkhaz to the upper istaros as well

[1/23/2025 3:02 PM] Deciusmus
so sembara basically this:

[1/23/2025 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[1/23/2025 3:04 PM] rsulfuratus
although i'd put the darkwood in sembara, it is much more closely tied to addermarch than the plaguelands

[1/23/2025 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
obviously the line between the upper istaros and the western green sea is pretty vague because nothing is invented in south cymea, but i think find to leave that vague, but include the "undeveloped historical insingue area" in upper istaros and the "undeveloped historical drankorian providence of South Cymea" in western green sea

[1/23/2025 3:46 PM] Deciusmus
where is the line between "Dunmar basin" and "Ruins of Drankor"?

[1/23/2025 3:46 PM] Deciusmus
another question:

[1/23/2025 3:47 PM] Deciusmus
is it more like the red or the black or something lese?

[1/23/2025 3:48 PM] Deciusmus
2nd is the dunmari north-western border more like red/blue/black or something lese?

[1/23/2025 3:50 PM] Deciusmus
finally should the Chardon vs Nevos/Apporia line be the green one along south chardon area, or more like the yellow one here?

[1/23/2025 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is roughly what I'd do

[1/23/2025 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[1/23/2025 4:28 PM] Deciusmus
where c = chardon?

[1/23/2025 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the Yeraad river valley is definitively not Nevos culturally, and better to keep the river together. the highlands towards Dunmar (south of the mountains) are Nevos; dividing line between Nevos/Dunmar is arbitrary - Darba was at one point Illorian, after all. the mountains should all be Chardon

[1/23/2025 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
the canal is clearly chardonian now, but the area is more nevos in culture. exact dividing line south of chardon TBD since that area is not invented. but for sure the canal should be nevos

[1/23/2025 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
to the south, basically the "high desert" should be outside greater dunmar, with the line running Xurkhaz east to Kharja, then south, cutting across the southern edge of the Hara River Gorge (the only outflow from the DUnmari Basin), then across Yuvanti to the line of the Shrev. this splits historical dunmar a bit but makes a good dividing line in the present between "dunmar-ish" and "true desolation"

[1/23/2025 4:34 PM] Deciusmus
with the cavaet that the line between "Eastern green sea" and "Far north" is actually totally arbitrary since this whole "far northeast" region is completely blank

[1/23/2025 4:34 PM] Deciusmus
Last question is this the right dividing line between "ursk-ish" and far north/eastern green sea?

[1/23/2025 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd put it along the ket (river that goes west from Zvervinka). that is basically the northern edge of Vargaldi territory and kind of marks "here be dragons beyond"

[1/23/2025 4:36 PM] Deciusmus
I plan to have a couple of dashed lines to indicate "totally arbitrary"

[1/23/2025 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
and the part of the map that is drawn with boreal forest north of the ket is "far north"

[1/23/2025 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
never decided what, if anything, should be in the blank space just north of zvervinka. probably that is "eastern green sea" (just extend the green line you have now to meet the ket)

[1/23/2025 4:55 PM] Deciusmus
would it make sense to split Mawar into a region with the rest of the "North Bay" ? it feels like development of the north bay region makes the most sense as part of a renewed interest in mawer

[1/23/2025 4:57 PM] Deciusmus
M= Mawar C = Chardon NS = north sentinenls S = sentinels

[1/23/2025 4:57 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. something like:

[1/23/2025 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, although actually this is all going to be reshuffled shortly due to the ongoing events in Chardon. there is actually an argumen that the Chardon region should really end at the northern extent of the Drankorian Empire, and that Voltara, Mawar, and the North Bay should be one region. Chardon would be the northern shore of lake valandros, nothwest along the southern edge of tawir forest, then along the mawar boundry mountains

[1/23/2025 5:00 PM] Deciusmus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/1755_1_1_image.png.3wqvblwdzP.png)

[1/23/2025 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
and lake valandros remains a big blank spot

[1/23/2025 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
for meta-game reasons, development in the north (voltara and surroundings) have proceded largely without much consideration of the south, except the chalyte trade links them

[1/23/2025 5:01 PM] Deciusmus
and then something like this for Mawar + the North?

[1/23/2025 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. although now I'm reconsidered whether the chardon line shouldn't include north apporia, basically a line from the southern end of the canal through the two hills to the coast

[1/23/2025 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure it matters too much either way. there are always going to be boundary regions

[1/23/2025 5:05 PM] Deciusmus
the advantage of moving it is it makes the canonical vs non-canonical clearer, i.e. it is a "canon exists north of here" line

[1/23/2025 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is a good argument

[1/23/2025 5:06 PM] Deciusmus
but of course as new things are made up those lines will always shift

[1/23/2025 5:07 PM] Deciusmus
here's what I have

[1/23/2025 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i think i'd shift it

[1/23/2025 5:08 PM] Deciusmus
green dotted lines are "this area is so poorly defined the regional boundaries are not clear"

[1/23/2025 5:10 PM] Deciusmus
I'll move Chardon/Nevos, any other feedback? otherwise I'm going to number them and update the region map in obsidian

[1/23/2025 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd move the upper istaros / Drankor ruins / western green sea line down to the Istaros tributary that comes from the eastern border mountains. south of tributary is Drankor ruins, north is upper istaros (west/inland) or western green sea (east/coast). the border mountains south of the river are Drankor ruins, north of the river are western green sea. reason is simply for ease of description, for the most part, and also because my feeling is that currently the desolation of cha'mutte is a little big and the south cymean world could reasonably expand into the mountains, but probably not too far south of that istaros tributary. but doesn't matter too much as that is obviously an unsettled border

[1/23/2025 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
for settled borders i'd push the northern border of the north sentinels up about 4-5 hexes, so it captures all of pandar, which extends for maybe 200 miles north of the mountain line just north of the forest of nightmares, or just make it dotted until the northern border of pandar is settled

[1/23/2025 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
i can import as a layer to the photoshop file at some point (unless you are doing this in photoshop already)

[1/23/2025 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
otherwise looks great

[1/23/2025 5:18 PM] Deciusmus
I am doing this in photoshop but I'm scared to do it in the real map because I don't know what I am doing 🙂

[1/23/2025 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i think I locked everything on the map, so you can't really edit the existing image (except I think text, which is easy to fix if it gets messed up)

[1/23/2025 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
plus I have a backup copy of the map that isn't shared

[1/23/2025 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I added a new layer (borders -> region borders), if you just make sure that layer is selected you can draw on it and it should be fine. or you should be able to copy-paste your existing layer to the new file

[1/23/2025 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
done

[1/23/2025 5:24 PM] Deciusmus
you need to close it for me to open

[1/23/2025 6:00 PM] Deciusmus
ok if I didn't screw anything up the layer should be saved in the main map

[1/23/2025 10:13 PM] Deciusmus
curious what you think if you get a chance to look

[1/23/2025 10:13 PM] Deciusmus
I pushed a branch, new-region-format where I was playing around with changing up the regions in the Gazetteer to align with the regions we defined earlier and moving the intro text we have about each region to the region landing page

[1/23/2025 10:14 PM] Deciusmus
I've only really done the Far North and a bit of North Sentinels

[1/23/2025 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
it is very appealing. the only issue is it become a bit unclear what to do with: (a) geographic features that are larger than a single region, such as the Sentinels (b) realms or other cultural/political pages that span multiple features

[1/23/2025 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i think (b) could be finessed by putting things in the most sensible place, but it kind of breaks the idea that there is only one chain of whereabouts. e.g., Voltara -> city in the Chardonian Empire -> realm in the Chardonian Central region (but Voltara is actually in the north region)

[1/23/2025 10:33 PM] Deciusmus
For realms, they mostly all fit in a single region, right?

[1/23/2025 10:34 PM] Deciusmus
I guess the Chardonian empire

[1/23/2025 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus
Chardonian Empire is most significant region-spanning political unit. But also something like western Cymea is functionally a Tollen colony in many ways, but is in a different region. And parts of coastal Vostok are controlled by the Skaer, but are in a different region

[1/23/2025 10:36 PM] Deciusmus
right it gets back to our conversation a long time ago about "part of" geographically vs "part of" politically

[1/23/2025 10:37 PM] Deciusmus
the river systems are a bit more of a pain

[1/23/2025 10:37 PM] Deciusmus
(on the Sentinels, I think it is fine to have a couple of pages -- Sentinels, Green Sea) just outside any region

[1/23/2025 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, although i think that could be finessed in various ways. river systems are worse because many of them span 2+ regions and it is tricky to break them up

[1/23/2025 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that conceptually it is fine for things to be in multiple regions, and even from a file organization point of view it wouldn't be too bad. but it breaks our whereabouts system

[1/23/2025 10:40 PM] Deciusmus
well, arguably for rivers you actually want them to be in watersheds, which in turn are either in a region or "in taelga"

[1/23/2025 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but then you won't put up those in a "list of rivers in XXX region" dataviewjs query, which is the main point of whereabouts

[1/23/2025 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so i think it is worth playing around with to see if we can make it wokr

[1/23/2025 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus
i really like the framework of the landing page for each region and having more smaller regions makes it easier to write up good landing pages

[1/23/2025 10:44 PM] Deciusmus
so actually the only major watersheds that spans regions is (a) the northern + southern Istaros are in two different regions, but also have very different characters (b) the Chasa-Nadhi and Yeerad river systems in Chardon

[1/23/2025 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, we've gone back and forth on that a lot. i think it makes sense in the upper istaros

[1/23/2025 10:44 PM] Deciusmus
I was thinking that Aurbez + Ardonne should really be in the Istaros region

[1/23/2025 10:45 PM] Deciusmus
so the geography aligns itself with the politcal and river systems in sembara better than in the west coast

[1/23/2025 10:45 PM] Deciusmus
the problem is that whereas on the east/sembara land the big dividing line is rivers or mountains, in the chardon world it is forests and distance

[1/23/2025 10:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the longest river that flows into the green sea that is mapped is the ket, which is conveniently a border of a region

[1/23/2025 10:46 PM] Deciusmus
yeah, its kinda hemmed in with the mostreve hills and the mountains and the ocean

[1/23/2025 10:46 PM] rsulfuratus
sembara also doesn't really have any long rivers

[1/23/2025 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
whereas on the west coast the chasa-nahadi is actually spilt across 4 regions if you count all tributaries

[1/23/2025 10:48 PM] rsulfuratus
and the istaros across 3

[1/23/2025 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that the ultimate solution would potentially be a partOf relationship for places

[1/23/2025 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
so that you'd have whereabouts trace a unique path from most specific to least specific that should always end in a region

[1/23/2025 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
then you could break up pages for big geographic features into multiple smaller pages (upper istaros, lower istaros), but have them all connected as partOf: Istaros Watershed

[1/23/2025 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus
and then big features could have their own pages that span regions (we'd need a good file organization so you don't end up with lots of loose pages)

[1/23/2025 10:52 PM] rsulfuratus
big political units could get the same treatment

[1/23/2025 10:52 PM] Deciusmus
Hrm…

[1/23/2025 10:52 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly, this would be used for: (a) all rivers, that should always be part of a watershed, unless they are the only named river (b) mountain chains that span regions (I think only the sentinels)

[1/23/2025 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure I get that

[1/23/2025 10:53 PM] Deciusmus
The other thought I had is home vs origin whereabouts might “just work”

[1/23/2025 10:54 PM] Deciusmus
Um, one sec

[1/23/2025 10:56 PM] Deciusmus
So the whereabouts concept already has the ability to have multiple whereabouts

[1/23/2025 10:57 PM] Deciusmus
And the dataview queries already have the concept of querying for: - in a region - in or from a region (And would be trivial to extent a bit as needed)

[1/23/2025 10:57 PM] Deciusmus
And different display text for different lines in the bio block

[1/23/2025 10:58 PM] rsulfuratus
so i guess for rivers or mountain chains the idea could be "origin" = "partOf" and "home" = "region" (or vice versa)?

[1/23/2025 10:59 PM] Deciusmus
so if the convention is: - origin location is always the watershed/mountain range - home location is the region - political unit is the “current”

[1/23/2025 11:02 PM] Deciusmus
Then you could have different types of queries on different pages. Because the all merge nicely if they are the same it should be possible to have say: some river near voltara - origin: Chasa-Nedhi watershed - home: northwest coast - current: northern frontier of chardon Then the Chardonian empire page would show everything currently in, the Northwest Coast would show everything based in (home) and the watershed page would show everything from (origin)

[1/23/2025 11:03 PM] rsulfuratus
that is pretty nice, actually. it might be worth updating the whereabouts code to accept some synonyms for home and away to make this a little bit clearer

[1/23/2025 11:04 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah. Anyway I gotta go to bed. Might play a little bit in the branch tomorrow

[1/23/2025 11:04 PM] Deciusmus
If some other river in say sembara doesn’t set anything but “whereabouts: sembara” all the queries still work because the whereabouts code knows that a single whereabout is home + origin + current

[1/23/2025 11:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess one problem is it doesn't allow origin to change, but realistically that should probably never change. but it might actually be better to swap that so the region is the origin, and home is the watershed etc

[1/23/2025 11:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i am about to go to bed too. i think the basic idea of just overloading whereabouts is clever though and probably the right solution

[1/23/2025 11:05 PM] Deciusmus
I like the idea of synonyms

[1/23/2025 11:06 PM] rsulfuratus
going to bed now

[1/23/2025 11:06 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, definitely worth fiddling with. i'm not doing any work on gazetteer pages for a while so good to mess around in a branch

[1/23/2025 11:06 PM] rsulfuratus
if we ues home for "watershed" you can even have the watershed of the Hara change pre and post Great War (if in fact the hara is now cut off from the Isatros), and things like that

[1/23/2025 11:16 PM] rsulfuratus
Thinking while brushing my teeth. You might want something like (would need to double check code so these may be incorrect): - type region: short hand for type home, end date 1 (so always set as origin and never home, even if home is absent) - type: subunit (or something) short hand for type: away, start: 1, end: 9999 (unless start or end are specified in which case use those), so always current location (home or origin would never be current location if they are different from away, I think) - partof: synonym for home but doesn’t set dates to anything in particular (shouldn’t be necessary I don’t think)

[1/24/2025 7:50 AM] Deciusmus
I did a quick test before starting work and with one minor tweak it all works. The main question is what do we want the display text to be. I think it is easiest to use home for region and origin for watershed. Origin is slightly wonkier than other whereabouts so it might be better to use it for the special case. So my proposal is: A place that is part of a larger geographic system (rivers, mostly, but some parts of mountain ranges or the green sea as well perhaps) should have an origin location for the part of thing. All places should have a home location that traces back to the region. A place that is part of a political unit outside its region (or in its region, if it makes sense to be "part of" two things, i.e. the Copper Hills might be part of Darba Highlands and Dunmar) should have a away line for the political unit

[1/24/2025 7:54 AM] Deciusmus
I'm proposing the following aliases: region => alias for home with no date polity => alias for away watershed => alias for home with date 1 (I can't think of a good alias for "geographic feature" and I think it will mostly be used for rivers)

[1/24/2025 7:55 AM] Deciusmus
(I know the Yemo'te isn't really part of Chasa-Nahadi, but it was a convinent test page)

[1/24/2025 7:55 AM] Deciusmus
The bit I'm not sure of is what should the bio block say:

[1/24/2025 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus
i mostly have a lot of work today but taking a break for a bit before my next meeting at 11 am. throwing out a few ideas, all just brainstormiing. (1) the whereabouts framework is very powerful and we've sort of used it to overload a couple of things (creator and owner for items, for example; now partof relationships and regions). so far we've kind of ad hoc used whatever works for overloading, but i wonder if it would be worthwhile (and how hard it would be) to clean up the code a little bit so that this is easier. i

[1/24/2025 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
just a thought as I have no specific comment and its been like a year since i looked at the code. but for example, what happens if you set "region" and "watershed" but not polity on something?

[1/24/2025 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure exactly what that would entail, but for example there is some wonkiness with items around "owner" vs "current location", and around "creater vs owner" if both are not specified. there are probably other edge issues

[1/24/2025 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess it is mostly a matter of getting the display right

[1/24/2025 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
anyway just idle thinking

[1/24/2025 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
but also there might be quirks or subties with how the chain of whereabouts works, e.g. since i think that always follows current location as you move up the chain

[1/24/2025 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
and while for Sembara it is easy to say "a realm in Greater Sembara", for the Chardonian Empire what do you say? I guess just "a realm in Taelgar" if it spands multiple regions (separate issue is file organization)

[1/24/2025 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
(2) what is the whereabouts for realms and how do subregions work? my guess is this stuff doesn't really work right but would be good to know. e.g., for a town in sembara, is there a way to generate a polity chain that goes "town -> barony -> subregion -> sembara"

[1/24/2025 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
(3) this might suggest that initially we start with just the home/origin distinction, where home is just what it currently is, and origin is a "geographic partof" relationship

[1/24/2025 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
(in part because i'm a little wary of leaving lots of half-finished frontmatter around)

[1/24/2025 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
(4) as for frontmatter, I think in general something like: if origin != home: - "A (typeof) in (origin)" first line - presumably never following a whereabouts chain so you only ever get the exact origin; i think in general this is fine because you typically wouldn't have multi-part part-of relationships; although e.g. the Western Gulf could be "a gulf in the Western Green Sea, Green Sea", that reads a little awkwardly to me and probably better to just say "A gulf in the Green Sea" - "

[1/24/2025 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
(although - something like the Gulf of Tollen is useful to place as a subfeature of the Western Gulf, so i'm not sure)

[1/24/2025 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
although if orgin == home you probably want just one line, "A river in (feature) -> (region)"

[1/24/2025 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
second line: Located in (feature) -> (region) seems fine

[1/24/2025 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure I like "Ruled by" for the polity

[1/24/2025 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
"Part of" might be fine for polity, actually

[1/24/2025 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
poking around wikipedia a little and kind of wondering if there are some fundamental issues with our organization that make it more inflexible than we'd like, and lead to these conversations popping up and us fiddling with region definitions.

[1/24/2025 10:43 AM] Deciusmus
I think the main issue is that - unlike on Earth - we (a) don't want to fully define reality and (b) want to group pages by things other than the strict "region"

[1/24/2025 10:44 AM] Deciusmus
I also think wikipedia is a little less template driven

[1/24/2025 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
right, what i'm thinking is that, for example: - in dunmar, where most invention has happened in the central and eastern regions where people are nomadic, it is not super important to define political units; instead, a lot of my invention has focused around geographic features because that is what you interact with in game - in sembara, where the geographic landscape is kind of generic medieval european, most of the development has instead focused on political units however, we are trying to fit these into the same kind of hierarchical clustering

[1/24/2025 10:46 AM] Deciusmus
right

[1/24/2025 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
the goal is not that we need an in depth article on the geographic of sembara, defining a bunch of basins or whatever

[1/24/2025 10:48 AM] Deciusmus
i.e. there is no concept of "location chains"

[1/24/2025 10:48 AM] Deciusmus
poking around wikipedia a bit the big difference is that wikipedia makes no attempt to apply hierarchy to a page

[1/24/2025 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
then there is the fact that rivers and mountains/hills tend to be added to the map even when other features are absent, so we have a lot of regions where there are a bunch of rivers and sometimes mountains but not much else

[1/24/2025 10:55 AM] Deciusmus
right

[1/24/2025 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the other thing wikipedia does a lot of is rely on landing pages, portals, and lots of list pages instead of a directory structure

[1/24/2025 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
like, maybe we don't actually want to have the whole gazetteer directory structure exposed in taelgarverse, and that might simplify things

[1/24/2025 10:57 AM] Deciusmus
but from an "inside obsidian" standpoint I think the directory structure can be a bit fluid

[1/24/2025 10:57 AM] Deciusmus
I agree that limiting how it is exposed (i.e. having a curated set of landing pages only, for example) might be nicer

[1/24/2025 10:57 AM] Deciusmus
I'm not really sure the directory structure is the problem though. I actually think the vast majority of pages will fit neatly in the categories from yesterday, even if a couple span (i.e. the Chardonian Empire page is clearly in the "chardon" category, even though parts of it are outside), and there is a handful of pages that are "Top level" (Endless Ocean, Eastern Ocean, Green Sea, Sentinels) and then a handful of directories that don't match regions (mostly watersheds)

[1/24/2025 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe

[1/24/2025 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
anyway, i'm going to be working on cosmology for a while yet, and need to write the cloudspinner adventure, so anything you want to mess around with on the branch is sensible

[1/24/2025 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
i also like the style of the dunmar page as an overview of major countries

[1/24/2025 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
fwiw, i like having overview geographic pages that focus on climate, terrain/ecology, and overall geographic features as a basic worldbuilding tool

[1/24/2025 11:11 AM] Deciusmus
I don't really have interest in mucking around in Javascript much; I guess my main question is... Does it seem worthwhile to have a working but slightly jury-rigged solution, which is based on the fact that (a) 90%+ of places are in a single realm + single region and will therefore not change (b) we care more about: having "realm" top level pages, "region" top level pages, and "watershed/mountain" top level pages being able to show the lists of places in those top level pages having a good set of landing pages than we do the exact "info box" text for a page (and in particular, we are happy to use page specific info-box text lines when needed, rather than trying to have a perfect general solution)

[1/24/2025 11:17 AM] Deciusmus
I might take a stab at dunmar re-org to see what it looks like

[1/24/2025 11:17 AM] Deciusmus
right

[1/24/2025 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
so i guess the main thing would be to always use synonyms instead of home/away

[1/24/2025 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
i think a jury-rigged implementation is fine. i think the main goal would to be jury-rig it in a way that makes it possible to improve if someone cares to muck about with javascript, without having to edit frontmatter (beyond displayDefaults)

[1/24/2025 11:53 AM] Deciusmus
So at a high level everything moves smoothly.... (a) Garamjala moves to ruins of drankor (b) Chataan Mountains moves to Greater Chardon (it was previously in Darba Highlands, but Darba Highlands was also defined as "the hills south of the Chataan mts, so I think moving is correct) The River Chaudi gets a bit funny as it is in the "Nayan Floodplains" which is now split across regions (north of shrev = dunmar, south of shrev = ruins of drankor).

[1/24/2025 11:59 AM] Deciusmus
I havent' done it, but the "Greater Dunmar" main page simplies to define 4 major topological features of Greater Dunmar: - Yuvanti Mts - Nayan Floodplain - Darba Highlands - Dunmari Basin And borders: - Sentinels to the North - Nevos Sea to the west & south west - Mryani Gap to the west/northwest - Garamjala Plateau to the east The current region borders have Dunmar going all the way to the Kuthul River, but I'm not sure if that is correct and perhaps "Greater Dunmar" ends at the Kharja instead.

[1/24/2025 12:26 PM] Deciusmus
Either way, from a rivers standpoint, the Greater Dunmar region has no mixed watersheds (although the map shows the Kharja and Hara joining, the text of both of the pages makes it seem like whether they do or not is unclear, and the gazetter would make more sense to have them unjoined and unclear)

[1/24/2025 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
(probably including the Shrev as well)

[1/24/2025 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
Nayan Floodplains should really properly refer to only the region north of the Shrev. all that is made up of the south of the shrev "increasingly jungle density as you go south", more or less -> fairly different from the canonical savannah like / rice growing floodplains of the settled part

[1/24/2025 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus
the Chaudi can just get tagged directly to the region, probably

[1/24/2025 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
re: borders, I think it is useful to have the Nashtkar, which is the rocky deserts north of the Garamjala, lower elevation and less dry (more american southwest than high andes desert) in greater dunmar

[1/24/2025 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
historically Kharja and Hara are part of the larger Istaros watershed (both join the Istaros north of Drankor), but in the current day they probably should both be treated as their own watersheds, with the Hara a significant watershed and the Kharja likely not, with few/no tributaries

[1/24/2025 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
whether either/both still join the Istaros is canonically unknown, although if you had stayed with vindristjarna instead of exploring the tower of the collosus i would have had to decide as you'd have flown over the point on the map where the hara is shown to flow into the istaros

[1/24/2025 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Chataan Mts, agree it makes sense and the Dunmari aren't really mountain people, but the name is Dunmari - probably should come up with a Chardonian name at some point, or an ancient pre-Drankor name

[1/24/2025 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
might include the Nashtkar as a fifth topological feature. i never quite worked out the topography here but based on the rivers, if the Dunmari Basin is indeed now an endorheic basin, the Nashtkar should be at a higher elevation and separate the Kharja rivershed from the Hara

[1/24/2025 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
now back to work - are you pushing this to your region branch? i might take a look later this afternoon

[1/24/2025 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but have to work now

[1/24/2025 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
fiddled with the region borders a tiny bit to move the greater dunmar border to the height of land between the kharja and the kuthul in the east (approx), and to get all of the garamjala (more or less) in the drankor region

[1/24/2025 1:34 PM] Deciusmus
I’m messing around some more at lunch. First I think I accidentally cropped the map. I was exporting it cropped (to remove far north/far south) and I didn’t mean to save the crop but I think it auto saved

[1/24/2025 1:35 PM] Deciusmus
Before we mess around with regions more might be good to restore a backup ? I can reapply the region layer I think easily enough

[1/24/2025 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I’ll take a look. I usually export and then crop, or alternatively make a mask layer. ChatGPT is pretty good at photoshop instructions

[1/24/2025 1:37 PM] Deciusmus
Second — names for regions most are obvious. A few questions Northwest Coast or Mawakel Region or ?? West Coast or Greater Chardon? Nevos Sea or Illoria or Southwest Coast?

[1/24/2025 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Greater Chardon and Nevos Sea

[1/24/2025 1:39 PM] Deciusmus
Very imperialist Chardon of you 😀

[1/24/2025 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
Northwest coast better than Mawakel though and probably fine

[1/24/2025 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
Neither northwest coast or Mawakel seem quite right. Maybe northern frontier is okay?

[1/24/2025 1:40 PM] Deciusmus
Wilds of Drankor?

[1/24/2025 1:40 PM] Deciusmus
Ruins of Drankor? Desolation of Cha’mutte? Drankorian Hinterland? ??

[1/24/2025 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
Drankorian hinterland is fine, although desolation of drankor maybe a better modern name

[1/24/2025 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I think drankorian hinterlands better though since only a part of the region is the desolation but whole think was core drankorian

[1/24/2025 1:43 PM] Deciusmus
- Ursk/north green sea coast? Northern Green Sea kinda works but it is mostly not the green sea at all

[1/24/2025 1:43 PM] Deciusmus
The other two slightly non obvious ones are - sentinels? It has a big stretch of forest to the west in it

[1/24/2025 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Sentinels is fine

[1/24/2025 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
fixed the map. shared a new copy

[1/24/2025 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
Ursk would be best named after the forest, but that doesn't have a name. i think Northern Green Sea is fine-ish and I can't really think of anything better. it does include a significant stretch of coast. Maybe Northern Green Sea Coast?

[1/24/2025 2:10 PM] Deciusmus
main issue is trying to avoid having both the sentinels (the mtn chain) and the sentinels (the region) have the same name

[1/24/2025 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, sure. could call the region the Central Highlands (old region name)

[1/24/2025 2:16 PM] Deciusmus
are the little islands south of illoria canonically in the nevos sea region or should I just draw a dotted ilne randomly?

[1/24/2025 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
Nevos sea

[1/24/2025 2:36 PM] Deciusmus
here is what I have for regions Region List - Northwest Coast - Greater Chardon - Nevos and Apporia - Northern Sentinels - Central Highlands - Greater Dunmar - Greater Sembara - Istaros Watershed - Drankorian Hinterland - Northern Green Sea - Western Green Sea

[1/24/2025 2:37 PM] Deciusmus
plus the features that are (a) big and (b) cross regions - Endless Ocean - Green Sea - ~Eastern Ocean~ - Sentinel Range - Chasa-Nahadi Watershed - Apporian Peninsula - Istaros-Mahar Watershed (but unclear given Drankor issues) - Yeraad River Valley

[1/24/2025 2:37 PM] Deciusmus
plus the "borders" that bound the known world: Endless Ocean Far North Eastern Green Sea Far South

[1/24/2025 2:38 PM] Deciusmus
Unclear if the Istaros-Mahar Watershed is really a thing, or if it is better thinking of the Istaros and the Mahar as two separate things, even though they do connect

[1/24/2025 2:41 PM] Deciusmus
My proposal was to (a) Make a folder for each of the regions in "region list" + eastern green sea (b) have a Faraway folder and put Far North/Far South/Omi in it (c) have a top level page for each of the items in the "big/cross region"

[1/24/2025 2:45 PM] Deciusmus
right, forgot that

[1/24/2025 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Istaros and Mahar are the same river, just different names

[1/24/2025 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Istaros Watershed should be “Upper Istaros” and the Istaros Watershed should get a top level page

[1/24/2025 2:46 PM] Deciusmus
any objection to removing the "northern" and "southern" continent stuff in the "World of Taelgar"

[1/24/2025 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I’d put northern and southern continent stuff in brainstorming, or maybe background

[1/24/2025 5:51 PM] Deciusmus
in particular, read the re-written Geography of Taelgar, if you have a chance

[1/24/2025 5:51 PM] Deciusmus
pushed some initial stuff

[1/24/2025 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
will look probably tomorrow morning. kate and i are about to go out but she is going to shrewsbury tomorrow so i'm going to try to finish my multiverse project. but also going to look at region stuff

[1/25/2025 9:58 AM] rsulfuratus
i like the basic style of the geography of taelgar page, can always fiddle around a bit but the basic idea is great and i think it highlights the right things

[1/25/2025 9:58 AM] rsulfuratus
poked around at the gazetteer reorg. i didn't make any edits as i don't want to get sucked into another taelgar project until i'm done with my multiverse rework, but i like the basic organization and framing. i don't know if it is easier to keep working in a branch for a bit until at least the basic framework for each region page is committed, but i'm fine either way

[1/25/2025 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
the one thing i might add is a "beyond the known world, rumors of..." section

[1/25/2025 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus
on the region pages: - the basic framework of the North Sentinels page seems great: major features, civiliations and cultures, history, and climate seem like the main useful headings we'll want - in previous region pages, i often included a lot of "what this place is like in the real world" detail. i think this belongs in dm notes, not player facing, but might want to have multiple campaign none blocks. the central highlands page has a lot of the kind of detail i find useful, but not organized well

[1/25/2025 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus
i think the exact heading and organization can vary - for greater dunmar where there is a lot of geographic detail, might have a terrain heading; for sembara, the civilations and cultures might need to be expanded or reorganized somehow

[1/25/2025 10:05 AM] rsulfuratus
i do think we should aim to keep the region pages to 1-2 paragraphs of text per subhead at most, and link out of broader descriptions if needed. e.g. for greater dunmar it would not be unreasonable to have a "geography of greater dunmar" page itself. the See more: [[link]] works pretty well i think when there is more detail than can be captured in 1-2 paragraphs

[1/25/2025 11:00 AM] Deciusmus
All makes sense. I’m out with Dana and Z right now but have some time this afternoon I will probably work on this a bit (although I have a little bit of session prep for my game tomorrow as well)

[1/25/2025 11:02 AM] Deciusmus
At which point probably makes sense to merge

[1/25/2025 11:02 AM] Deciusmus
But I don’t think I’m going to try to write good pages for all the regions, just basic stuff

[1/25/2025 11:02 AM] Deciusmus
My main goal is to finish moving pages around, check and cleanup whereabouts that are wrong or broken, and make a basic landing page with each region, that has at least a map, the high level headings, and a sentence or two under each heading. This morning I got pretty far on a food greater sembara page

[1/25/2025 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
i have some ideas to clean up the maps a bit, but won't mess around with that for a while and it is helpful to have the basic maps in there immediately

[1/25/2025 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, agreed. i think writing good pages for everything will take some time

[1/25/2025 12:44 PM] Deciusmus
what do you think of this: ## Civilizations and Cultures See more: [[Sembara]], [[Tyrwingha]], [[Addermarch]], [[Tollen]], [[Vostok]], [[Zimkova]], [[Duchy of Maseau]] This is a heavily peopled land. In the north, amongst the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], the [[Zimka]] people live a traditional life in the highlands of [[Zimkova]], and have formed three realms: [[Breva]], [[Lavnoch]], and [[Ardlas]]. South and east of the Zimkovan realms is [[Sembara]], a rich and powerful monarchy with a long history. Sembara is bordered to its south by the ancient fey-protected realm of [[Tyrwingha]], as well as the independent earldom of [[Addermarch]] and the [[Duchy of Maseau]], once under the suzeranity of Sembara, but now an independent land populated by refugees from the [[Isingue]] and the [[Plaguelands]]. To the east is the famous [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]] and past Tollen, the lightly populated coasts and forests of [[Vostok]]. There are two large and ancient lizardfolk settlements: [[Ozabal]], in the delta of the [[Wistel]], and [[Latazaro]], on the eastern borders of [[Tyrwingha]]. Beyond these settlements, lizardfolk are common along the river valleys. There are three major [[Dwarves|dwarven]] realms on the western borders, and dwarves are common in the human cities of Sembara, although there are no large, independent dwarven realms within Greater Sembara. Halflings are commonly seen plying their trade along the roads and rivers of the region, as well sailing across the [[Western Gulf]] and into the wider [[Green Sea]]. Although [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]] are never common, they too are seen in the cities of Sembara, although, like dwarves, there are no large stoneborn communities within the region.

[1/25/2025 1:06 PM] Deciusmus
I pushed a slightly updated structure for the Greater Sembara page, which I think is a good general structure for these main region pages. Let me know what you think, if you get a chance to look at it

[1/25/2025 1:25 PM] rsulfuratus
obviously needs a bit of filling in, and such, but the basic structure feels very cohesive

[1/25/2025 1:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i like the greater sembara page a lot

[1/25/2025 1:26 PM] Deciusmus
do you have any sense what the geographic of central vostok is like?

[1/25/2025 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
not really

[1/25/2025 1:28 PM] Deciusmus
i'm envisioning everything inside the yellow as "highlands"

[1/25/2025 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
the river patterns imply roughly that, yes

[1/25/2025 1:29 PM] Deciusmus
which nicely separates Tollen from Vostok except by sea

[1/25/2025 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but not sure if that is canonical

[1/25/2025 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
the hills east/south east of tollen should probably extend up the volta a bit. at one point this was thought to be source of metal for the tollen mint

[1/25/2025 1:31 PM] Deciusmus
but the ? I don't have a clear sense of

[1/25/2025 1:31 PM] Deciusmus
and I'm envisioning the "P" area to be a moderately high plateau (not Tibet or anything like that, but still 2000-4000 ft)

[1/25/2025 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the region north of the wall is only not forest because it is too dry

[1/25/2025 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
probably in general it should be forest

[1/25/2025 1:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is not really far enough north for tundra

[1/25/2025 1:35 PM] rsulfuratus
actually something like this is maybe a good model: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_forest_steppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_forest_steppe "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_forest_steppe")

[1/25/2025 1:35 PM] Deciusmus
is it relatively low/flat, or is it hilly?

[1/25/2025 1:35 PM] Deciusmus
right, I mean, the map has it as forest. right now I'm just trying to finish the "topography and major features" section of the greater sembara page

[1/25/2025 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
and the vostok coast is fairly flat until you get to near the mountains

[1/25/2025 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
(ish)

[1/25/2025 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i think for topography, the area around the word "Vostok" is lowlands

[1/25/2025 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
something like the saint lawerence gulf coast of canada

[1/25/2025 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
river valleys slope down towards the coast in light blue

[1/25/2025 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
the dark blue are highlands, with the plateau with the lake maybe kind of like lake yellowston

[1/25/2025 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/rsulfuratus/1553_1_1_sembara-region-map.png.Wr_JAMNL77.png)

[1/25/2025 1:41 PM] Deciusmus
yeah I think that makes sense

[1/25/2025 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
with light blue circle coastal lowlands

[1/25/2025 1:42 PM] Deciusmus
where perhaps a northern forest/taiga/interior maine type climate gives way to your kazakh forest steppe as the elevation gets higher and drier

[1/25/2025 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
this fits with the cultural history description of the northwest corner of vostok really being part of zimkova

[1/25/2025 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
not obvious on the map but i think the idea would be that the lowland rivers have many unmapped tributaries but the "lake yellowstone" area does not

[1/25/2025 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
right, since most of the moisture comes from the green sea by the time you get to 4000 feet it is cold and dry

[1/25/2025 1:57 PM] Deciusmus
ok so something like this:

[1/25/2025 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[1/25/2025 2:05 PM] Deciusmus
where pink = highlands, blue = lowlands, #1 - "Zimkova foothills" - hilly "highland" terrain, mostly forested, many rivers and lakes that are not on the map, plus the big ones that are. Zimka culture #2 - "Vostok High Plateau" - yellostone-esque, blank culturally (but lightly peopled) #3 - Mostreve Hills #4 - main Sembaran lowland #5 = Maseau Plains (distinct and drier than main lowland, bit of Mostreve Hills rain shadow/less moisture from Green Sea) #6 = "Vostok lowlands" (eastern Canada) with the green lines rising up to the hills #7 - undefined Tollen highlands, separates tollen from Vostok, probably a blank slate for right now but no people really #8 = coastal highlands, also likely undefined and probably Skaer

[1/25/2025 2:06 PM] Deciusmus
6 is basically the "Kem Watershed"; 4 is the "Semb/Wistel/Volta watersheds"

[1/25/2025 3:28 PM] Deciusmus
but I pushed an update

[1/25/2025 3:28 PM] Deciusmus
I have to go shopping or we wont have any food to make for dinner

[1/25/2025 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yes planning on it

[1/25/2025 3:29 PM] Deciusmus
btw can you bring the maple syrup and camera when you come over

[1/25/2025 3:29 PM] Deciusmus
with (a) a mostly done Greater Sembara and Far North pages (b) a worklist for everything that needs doing (c) started North Sentinels page

[1/26/2025 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus
looked at your region branch some more. i think the design is really good and we should just merge it, even in the somewhat draft form it is currently in

[1/26/2025 10:42 AM] Deciusmus
I have a game today so don't have time for anything except a bit of last minute prep, but happy for you to merge it if you want

[1/26/2025 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
so i'll merge sometime this morning

[1/26/2025 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm going to be out for most of the afternoon but am going to fiddle around a bit for the next hour or two

[1/26/2025 10:45 AM] Deciusmus
all pushed last night

[1/26/2025 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
make sure you push any in-flight changes on the new-region-format branch that you want to keep

[1/26/2025 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm doing some cleanup. what is your opinion about stashing blank pages in staging vs just having stubs in main gazetteer? my preference is to have unnamed places and places without frontmatter in staging, and move stubs that have (a) a name and (b) frontmatter to the correct folder but relatively weak preference

[1/26/2025 12:04 PM] Deciusmus
But no strong preference

[1/26/2025 12:04 PM] Deciusmus
I was using staging for unnamed ~ pages and liked it

[1/26/2025 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
okay. i'm taking a break from cosmology and doing some gazetteer cleanup, going to move all unnamed pages to staging for cleanup. i have a "backlinks in staging" _MoC doc to help figure out which staging pages are frequently linked to guide prioritization

[1/26/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed an update to cosmology that reorganizes things a little - basically, the in-world scholarly critics of the concept of Echo Realms convinced me that the Feywild and the Dreamworld are central enough to move to the main "Multiverse" directory (once I have a chance to update them), and the rest of the "Echo Realms" are in the Demiplanes folder. curious what you think - context of the note is relevant here

[1/26/2025 9:07 PM] Deciusmus
I looked briefly. I like the basic idea but didn’t really have the energy tonight to dig into it

[1/26/2025 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but yeah no rush or anything. still working through various cosmology things anyway

[1/26/2025 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
the challenge wih creating all kinds of variant planar classifications is we still need to pick one to organize files by

[1/27/2025 9:33 AM] Deciusmus
I have meetings from 9-2pm today straight, with a handful of 15 or 30 minute breaks; I'm cleaing up some gazetter stuff. My plan is to set the main pages to dm_owner: none / dm_notes: none / status/needswork/wip Then whoever finishes the page can set the dm owner/dm notes to themselves if needed, and then set status/check/otherperson to review/add any dm status, etc

[1/27/2025 9:38 AM] Deciusmus
I am added a todo to it and copied it over

[1/27/2025 9:38 AM] Deciusmus
very useful

[1/27/2025 9:38 AM] Deciusmus
yeah I saw that

[1/27/2025 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
in case useful I put a template for region pages and the text of the old region background page in _MoC yesterday

[1/27/2025 2:08 PM] Deciusmus
But I think the away / current idea would work for political units

[1/27/2025 2:08 PM] Deciusmus
So I spent a few minutes poking at whereabouts. The origin/home stuff doesn’t actually work that well

[1/27/2025 2:10 PM] Deciusmus
Basically the idea is — imagine a small island off the coast of Irrla. Call it Ril. In general we probably want to say three things about it: (a) this island is in the Green Sea (B) this island is part of the Republic of Sorvah (sp) (C) this island is in the “Eastern Green Sea region”

[1/27/2025 2:11 PM] Deciusmus
(A) is the main “geographic relationship” (B) is a political relationship (C) is a meta/info organization relationship

[1/27/2025 2:13 PM] Deciusmus
You care about these three distinctions because you want to be able: - have a page with “islands in the Green Sea” (and show the text “An island in the Green Sea”) in the header block - this is A - have a page “places in the Republic of Sorvah” (this is B) - have a page “places in the eastern green sea “(c)

[1/27/2025 2:14 PM] Deciusmus
But I think having a “pages on region” is a useful thing to be able to do

[1/27/2025 2:14 PM] Deciusmus
I actually think most of the time you don’t care about c in the page header block

[1/27/2025 2:15 PM] Deciusmus
That said, in the short term I’m not sure that c is actually valuable enough to try to make work

[1/27/2025 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm

[1/27/2025 2:17 PM] Deciusmus
Exactly

[1/27/2025 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
i might be missing something. is the distinction between "A" and "C" just because "Green Sea" is too big to fit in a specific region?

[1/27/2025 2:17 PM] Deciusmus
So my proposal for now would be to - allow for “polity” as an alias for away - allow for “geography” as an alias for home - don’t try to map pages to regions where it does not make sense. Everything should either map to a region or one of our “top level” pages

[1/27/2025 2:18 PM] Deciusmus
Or a dwarven kingdom is “realm in the Sentinels” (which is also too big for a region)

[1/27/2025 2:18 PM] Deciusmus
No concept of “west/north/east”

[1/27/2025 2:18 PM] Deciusmus
So ie Irrla goes Irrla -> Green Sea

[1/27/2025 2:21 PM] Deciusmus
Well, what I’m saying is that for now, Irrla and similar places won’t be in any region

[1/27/2025 2:21 PM] Deciusmus
Right

[1/27/2025 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure that this needs any revision particulary to the standard home?

[1/27/2025 2:22 PM] Deciusmus
Because we don’t have a good way to distinguish between “Irrla an island in the green sea” vs “Irrla a place in the eastern green sea region”

[1/27/2025 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but we still want to track the watershed it is part of

[1/27/2025 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. a river in the Elderwood is probably best tagged as "elderwood" for whereabouts

[1/27/2025 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
have meetings - have a few more thoughts but not time to type them up now. mostly, i'm not sure this does anything for the original "partOf" discussion necessarily

[1/27/2025 2:45 PM] Deciusmus
So here are two pages:

[1/27/2025 2:46 PM] Deciusmus
Kayan has whereabouts = Elderwood, which then tracks back to "Central Highlands" region. Page looks fine - the problem is that we don't know which watershed it is part of (i.e. nothing in the metadata says "tributary of the Chasa"

[1/27/2025 2:47 PM] Deciusmus
Another way of thinking about it is that we have a set of top level pages (i.e. Gazeteer pages that are "in Taelgar"). For any given page, it might want to be part of 2 of those top level pages.

[1/27/2025 2:47 PM] Deciusmus
Darakan also looks fine. Whereabouts = Khatridun which is then part of sentinels. Page looks fine - the problem is that we don't know which region it is part of

[1/27/2025 2:48 PM] Deciusmus
But there is no clear why to know which top level page is the "main one" and which is the "secondary" one

[1/27/2025 2:52 PM] Deciusmus
So I think you had originally had the idea of using part of, but where do you set it? it makes sens to say that he Kayan is "part of" the Chasa Nadhi Watershed, but does it make sense to say that Darakan is "part of" the Central Highlands region? I don't think so

[1/27/2025 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't solve the issue of two top level links

[1/27/2025 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I think partOf only really works for subunits - rivers are part of a watershed, mountains are part of a mountain chain, bays/gulfs/etc are part of a sea or ocean

[1/27/2025 2:55 PM] Deciusmus
yes, having all rivers have "part of" linking to a watershed page would be fine

[1/27/2025 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
but for Darakan it doesn't work at all

[1/27/2025 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
so for e.g. rivers it works generally fine

[1/27/2025 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
except in so far as the partOf is the second page you want to link to

[1/27/2025 2:56 PM] Deciusmus
but outside of watersheds I'm not really sure it works well

[1/27/2025 2:57 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. Urlich Pass is "part of" the Sentinels, but why would you set it as part of not just whereabouts: Sentinels. the "High Peak of the Tyrwinghan Range" is part of the mostreve hills, but again, why would you not just set it as whereabouts?

[1/27/2025 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
or for "cross typeOf" relationships

[1/27/2025 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the generalization challenge is it doesn't work well for subunits of subunits

[1/27/2025 2:58 PM] Deciusmus
and go back and set "partOf: Enst Watershed"

[1/27/2025 2:58 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. at some level we think it makes sense to go to a page like:

[1/27/2025 2:58 PM] Deciusmus
watershed works because are amused/think it is worthwhile to specially tag it

[1/27/2025 2:59 PM] Deciusmus
but I wouldn't want to change the whereabouts: there - the river is entirely in the Barony of Aveil

[1/27/2025 3:01 PM] Deciusmus
I think the generalization challenge with "partOf" is that it only works well if it isn't used as a special case. i.e. it works to say: all typeOf = river should have a partOf = watershed

[1/27/2025 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
So, maybe a different way to look at it: the basic challenge is that any given location can be located in more than one context. A town can be part of a geographic region and a realm/subrealm, for example

[1/27/2025 3:04 PM] rsulfuratus
Some things - rivers primarily - might have three contexts: a geographic feature, a political feature, a watershed

[1/27/2025 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Using away = political unit simplifies a lot of cases if it works

[1/27/2025 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
The question is how much work is it worth to make this work smoothly

[1/27/2025 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
But also eg things that are located in region-spanning things could have three places. A political location, a subunit leading to the region, and the “bigger thing”

[1/27/2025 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Eg many rivers have two contexts: a watershed and a realm

[1/27/2025 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe that is good enough

[1/27/2025 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
But that comes back to “home = geography, away = polity” and you still need to pick a single geographic chain to follow as you initially suggested

[1/27/2025 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
It might even be easier to extend whereabouts with additional keywords (region, watershed) as necessary than try to use only home/origjn/away for everything

[1/27/2025 3:20 PM] Deciusmus
I actually think the challenge is that for most pages, the context is actually the same

[1/27/2025 3:21 PM] Deciusmus
so I don't want to add work, i.e. say that all pages need a "part of" and a "whereabouts" or whatever

[1/27/2025 3:21 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. yes a town could be part of a geographic region and a realm; but for 95% of towns those are the same

[1/27/2025 3:22 PM] Deciusmus
but i.e. if you wanted to find all the rivers without a watershed, how would you do it?

[1/27/2025 3:22 PM] Deciusmus
the appeal of using whereabouts was that the code already defaults them to each other whereabouts: X is already shorthand for home: X and origin: X and current: X

[1/27/2025 3:25 PM] Deciusmus
* political units are plauisbly dated

[1/27/2025 3:25 PM] Deciusmus
using away for political unit has two advantages: * the whereabouts code already have the concept of "home" vs "current" location and this is (mostly) already working even when following chains

[1/27/2025 3:26 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. if Chardon had conqueored Darba, some value in having Darba = part of Dunmar in 1720 but part of Chardon in 1750

[1/27/2025 3:27 PM] Deciusmus
because "origin" is really just shorthand for "home at your birth date"

[1/27/2025 3:27 PM] Deciusmus
but whereabouts doesn't overload (currently) to a third concept

[1/27/2025 3:27 PM] Deciusmus
also I think in general political entities are all in a single region with the exception of Chardon + Tollen, and also mostly political entities chain nicely, i.e. you don't have to change that many pages

So I guess to simplify..... my position is something like: For any given page, there is almost always an obvious whereabouts to put it in For most pages, this obvious whereabout is the only whereabout * For some pages, the obvious whereabout causes the page to chain up to something like "skips" a key "unit" for this page. Most obvious examples are pages that are in Green Sea or Sentinels (which skip region), or rivers (which skip the watershed, if it is between the region and Taelgar); but some pages (i.e. Westcliff) are best stated as "in the Mostreve Hills" but that might be skipping the realm (i.e. Addermarch or Tyrwingha)

[1/27/2025 3:38 PM] Deciusmus
I actually think the 3rd bullet is entirely a boundary drawing issue... The "Chasa-Nadhi" watershed crosses regions, so anything where the "primary" location chain is in a region won't also be in the watershed page The "Mostreve Hills" crosses realms, so anything where the primary location chain goes up to Mostreve Hills skips the realm * The Sentinels crosses regions, so anything where the "primary" location chain chains up to sentinels won't be in any region

[1/27/2025 3:39 PM] Deciusmus
I don't think it is a context or typeOf issue at all, in other words, it is just a problem that occurs when the nested of locations in other locations hits a location that crosses a boundary

[1/27/2025 3:40 PM] Deciusmus
Imagine a "Mos Numema temple complex" in Embry, which straddles the "Old City" and "New City". And then you have a Temple of the Wildling. It can't be in both "mos numena template complex, Embry..." and "Old City, Embry"

[1/27/2025 3:41 PM] Deciusmus
But this goes back to how much effort to solve it.

[1/27/2025 3:41 PM] Deciusmus
But you might want it to be.

[1/27/2025 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
however, I think that solving that general problem in a satisfying way might be extremely complex

[1/27/2025 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes. the basic issue is that there is not a strict 1:1 relationship between levels of geography

[1/27/2025 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
the challenge is more what would we want the code to do?

[1/27/2025 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
although if we could write a good spec doc, chatGPT-o1 could almost certainly write the code

[1/27/2025 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
hence wondering about solving subsets of the problem that come up most frequently

[1/27/2025 3:43 PM] Deciusmus
Yes, I agree

[1/27/2025 3:45 PM] Deciusmus
Right, I guess I could see a few ways forward: (a) ignore it entirely. Pages have a "primary" whereabouts and that means sometimes they won't appear in other queries that would make sense for them to appear in (b) ignore it for now. don't try to solve subparts of the problem, and just live with some query-gaps until we have the desire/energy to try to tackel the general problem. (c) pick one or two key subparts that bug us/have high value and solve them individually. Potential subparts could be: watersheds regions mountain ranges oceans/seas

[1/27/2025 3:46 PM] Deciusmus
then with c, there is the "try to do it in a way that makes it possible to roll into a general solution later" vs just say "watershed: x" is a new valid frontmatter tag

[1/27/2025 3:47 PM] Deciusmus
and I guess within C there is also a bit of a question about what exactly the problem is

[1/27/2025 3:48 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. if the goal is to just have a dataview query on each watershed page that gets all the rivers in the watershed, you could just add watershed: x and it would work. If the goal was to have watersheds appear in the info block in a nice way then that requires some coding

[1/27/2025 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think there are two kinds of problems here: (1) from a query point of view: being able to identify all the places that are located in a bigger place is very useful. since we do not have the world uniquely divided up into non-overlapping "bigger places", this creates gaps that are kind of annoying. e.g., a list of "all the realms in region XX" is going to be incomplete if any realms cross regions, which is annoying. (2) from a data point of view: the larger context is very helpful to report in the frontmatter since sometimes this is all we know about a thing. for many rivers, the only invented information is that it is drawn on the map - in this case, both the watershed and the actual location (and realm, if relevant) are useful. similarly true for bays/gulfs and for (some) small islands.

[1/27/2025 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
well maybe that last sentence is not quite right

[1/27/2025 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
these two are in conflict, because guaranteeing 1 makes 2 impossible

[1/27/2025 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure there is a simple way to tackle (c) that would really be satisfying

[1/27/2025 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i actually think that your proposed (b) is likely the best solution

[1/27/2025 4:07 PM] Deciusmus
OK. I gotta finish some emails, but here is what I have working as a quick fix. (a) whereabouts accepts 2 new types: region (synonym for home) and polity (synonym for away with an end date of 9999 unless it is specified) (b) there is a new format string, "region", which is is like current or home or origin, but which follows region rather than current

[1/27/2025 4:09 PM] Deciusmus
so if I take Illoria and set the whereabouts to: whereabouts: - {type: region, location: Nevos Sea } - {type: polity, location: Chardonian Empire, start: 1740 }

[1/27/2025 4:10 PM] Deciusmus
you likely need to set the display defaults (wCurrent) on the page to get decent output

[1/27/2025 4:10 PM] Deciusmus
(after 1740)

[1/27/2025 4:10 PM] Deciusmus
I get:

[1/27/2025 4:11 PM] Deciusmus
then on Burganos, I can set: whereabouts: - {type: region, location: Illoria } and just get

[1/27/2025 4:12 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. there is no way to show on the burganos page both polity chain and region chain, you have to pick which one

[1/27/2025 4:12 PM] Deciusmus
not sure it is worth pushing

[1/27/2025 4:12 PM] Deciusmus
gah, nevermind, it doesn't really work that well in any non-trivial case

[1/27/2025 4:13 PM] Deciusmus
nothing in the code is smart enough to realize the chain might be different

[1/27/2025 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
but Illoria is actually the special case there

[1/27/2025 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
ah right

[1/27/2025 4:13 PM] Deciusmus
no because they are both Iloria so we drop

[1/27/2025 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
whereabouts: {type: region, location: Illoria } {type: polity, location: Illoria } doesn't work?

[1/27/2025 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
(although in practice dunmar is the special case because mostly we don't have geography pages)

[1/27/2025 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for Karawa, you have polity: Eastern Dunmar and region: Karawa Desert

[1/27/2025 4:15 PM] Deciusmus
Westcliff works:

[1/27/2025 4:16 PM] Deciusmus
right this works:

[1/27/2025 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is the same as the dunmar case, as long as the geography page and the polity page are different it should be fine

[1/27/2025 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is worth pushing. i might change the wCurrent default for place to something else, maybe "Located in"

[1/27/2025 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think you should never have away without home, right? because if there is just one whereabout you'd always use home

[1/27/2025 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
or polity could be a synonym for away unless !home in which case home, to catch the edge case where you want to specify polity because of a change in ownership but don't have a region

[1/27/2025 4:21 PM] Deciusmus
that's a bit more annoying to implement

[1/27/2025 4:27 PM] Deciusmus
correctly returns everything Nevos Sea

[1/27/2025 4:27 PM] Deciusmus
that is: dataviewjs const { util } = customJS dv.table(["Place", "Type Of"], dv.pages("#place") .where(f => util.inRegion("Nevos Sea", f.file.frontmatter, dv.current().pageTargetDate)) .sort(b => util.s("<maintype>", b.file)) .map(b => <a style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(0, 168, 252);cursor:pointer !important" href="" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="">util.s("<name> (<pronunciation>)", b.file), util.s("<maintype>", b.file)</a>)

[1/27/2025 4:27 PM] Deciusmus
ok, I fixed it so dataview queries at least work

[1/27/2025 4:28 PM] Deciusmus
so altogether Burganos can't on the info block show both Chardonian Empire and Nevos Sea, it is in both

[1/27/2025 4:28 PM] Deciusmus
and there is an "inPolity" that correctly returns everything in the polity

[1/27/2025 4:34 PM] Deciusmus
Isingue is a bit weird

[1/27/2025 4:35 PM] Deciusmus
which makes sense, but it means you can't say "used to be part of ..."

[1/27/2025 4:35 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. we in general never display "aways" that are no longer current

[1/27/2025 4:35 PM] Deciusmus
but there is no concept of "past away"

[1/27/2025 4:35 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. if you change the current date to 1544 it changes to "An Isinguer city in the Upper Isaros" and adds the polity line

[1/27/2025 4:35 PM] Deciusmus
this works:

[1/27/2025 4:36 PM] Deciusmus
which I think is fine

[1/27/2025 5:10 PM] Deciusmus
seems to work pretty well

[1/27/2025 5:10 PM] Deciusmus
ok, I should't have spent quite so long on this but I pushed a change

[1/27/2025 6:08 PM] Deciusmus
ie.

[1/27/2025 6:08 PM] Deciusmus
OK. So poking a bit. This region vs polity thing helps a lot, in that it makes it easy to segragate the "political/realms" context from the "geography/features" context

[1/27/2025 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
looks nice

[1/27/2025 6:13 PM] Deciusmus
ok

[1/27/2025 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm trying to finish the feywild note. will want your comment on the level of detail for public pages at some point

[1/27/2025 6:17 PM] Deciusmus
Main annoying things: anything where you have a single whereabouts you get the the "region" chain rather than the "polity" change

[1/27/2025 6:18 PM] Deciusmus
but its a bit annoying

[1/27/2025 6:18 PM] Deciusmus
you can fix it with display defaults:

[1/27/2025 6:18 PM] Deciusmus
does this:

[1/27/2025 6:18 PM] Deciusmus
so for example "The Drunken Dolphin" an inn in Castrella

[1/27/2025 6:19 PM] Deciusmus
but then you get "located in" rathre than "A tavern in"

[1/27/2025 6:19 PM] Deciusmus
you can also fix it by doing type: plity

[1/27/2025 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
it feels like fiddling with the output handler could fix that

[1/27/2025 6:22 PM] Deciusmus
yeah

[1/27/2025 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
you have all the correct location information in the whereabouts object itself it is just about picking what to display

[1/27/2025 6:23 PM] Deciusmus
so it is the difference between "" or ""

[1/27/2025 6:23 PM] Deciusmus
the problem is that under the covers you are either following the "home" or the "current" location

[1/27/2025 6:24 PM] Deciusmus
but kinda something like displayDefaults: {defArt: "", placewhereabouts: polity } tags: [place] whereabouts: Castrella

[1/27/2025 6:24 PM] Deciusmus
or even on a typeOf basis

[1/27/2025 6:24 PM] Deciusmus
what you really want is a "placedefault" where you can chose if you want it to be region or polity on a page-basis

[1/27/2025 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
that seems unnecessarily complicated since you can override by specifying the whereabouts?

[1/27/2025 6:25 PM] Deciusmus
the other annoying thing is there is no way to have 2 whereabouts on a page that doenst have 2 whereabouts

[1/27/2025 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
you could if the output handler were smarter about having a primary string and a secondary string

[1/27/2025 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but this is an output handler thing isn't it?

[1/27/2025 6:26 PM] Deciusmus
but you can't

[1/27/2025 6:27 PM] Deciusmus
so it uses "the home unknown" and the "current" display strings

[1/27/2025 6:27 PM] Deciusmus
the problem is that this: whereabouts: - {type: polity, location: Castrella} because it is shorthand for whereabouts: - {type: away, location: Castrella} generates Home location: unknown Current location: Castrella

[1/27/2025 6:27 PM] rsulfuratus
that is you don't want "wHome" and "wCurrent" for places, you want "wPrimary" and "wSecondary"

[1/27/2025 6:28 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. you get this

[1/27/2025 6:28 PM] Deciusmus
not Castrella, Cedrano

[1/27/2025 6:28 PM] Deciusmus
so you get Castrella, Apporia

[1/27/2025 6:28 PM] Deciusmus
yes but it thinks you should follow the "home" chain

[1/27/2025 6:28 PM] Deciusmus
the "home unknown" display string is "", so you just get "current" which is "Located in "

[1/27/2025 6:28 PM] rsulfuratus
right but can't the output handler see this is a place and set home to Castrella too?

[1/27/2025 6:29 PM] Deciusmus
because if you wanted Castrella, Apporia, rather than Castrella, Chardonian Empire, you could set type: region

[1/27/2025 6:29 PM] Deciusmus
It would be straightforward (ish) to make "polity with no home" the same as home (as you suggested above) but it doesn't really solve anything

[1/27/2025 6:31 PM] Deciusmus
Well, no

[1/27/2025 6:31 PM] Deciusmus
yes

[1/27/2025 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
i must be missing something. if you set type = polity, you ge the right chain, right? the only problem is you have the wrong display string

[1/27/2025 6:32 PM] Deciusmus
so the problem is what should we display? we don't know if we should display or

[1/27/2025 6:32 PM] Deciusmus
these are reprsented by the and tokens in the output handler/token parser code

[1/27/2025 6:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yes

[1/27/2025 6:32 PM] Deciusmus
that isn't how chains work. You have two chains: the "home" aka region chain which is " Castrella; Apporia the "current" aka polity chain which is "Castrella; Chardonian Empire"

[1/27/2025 6:33 PM] Deciusmus
so if we are displaying the "home" string, we use the token and if we are displaying the "current" string we use the token

[1/27/2025 6:33 PM] Deciusmus
right now it works because we have: "wHome" : " <(of )primary> ", "wCurrent" : "Located ",

[1/27/2025 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
right but this is what I mean about primary vs secondary. you need four displaystrings for locations: - primaryRegion: " <(of )primary> " - primaryPolity: " <(of )primary> ", - secondaryRegion: "Located " - secondaryPolity: ""Located "

[1/27/2025 6:34 PM] Deciusmus
anyway, time for dinner but I'll be around later

[1/27/2025 6:34 PM] Deciusmus
but what we want is to display the home string (i.e. the full " <(of )primary> ") but using insteadof

[1/27/2025 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think all in output handler

[1/27/2025 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean a little more complicated

[1/27/2025 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think in that case it is just a matter of picking something, and then if you set the other, you get both, right?

[1/27/2025 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
then you need some logic about which is primary and which is secondary if there are both, and which is primary if there is one

[1/27/2025 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
might be wrong

[1/27/2025 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
actually you might be able to just change this to compare strings not locations: if (!whereabout.current.location || whereabout.current.location != whereabout.home.location) {

[1/27/2025 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus

[1/27/2025 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/rsulfuratus/1340_1_1_image.png.8_nHjxEJuG.png)

[1/27/2025 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
why does the order matter?

[1/27/2025 7:08 PM] Deciusmus
that's a bug; haven't figured it out yet

[1/27/2025 7:16 PM] Deciusmus
I'm not sure if primary/secondary is the right way to think about it...

[1/27/2025 7:17 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe "primary/secondary" is wrong but if you can write down under which conditions you;d want each combination it should be possible to code in output handler

[1/27/2025 7:17 PM] rsulfuratus
fundamentally though you basically want some combination of (full description, located in) (region chain, polity chain)

[1/27/2025 7:18 PM] Deciusmus
right but I dont think you can define the conditions correctly without changing the lower layers

[1/27/2025 7:19 PM] Deciusmus
yeah but it doesn't have the chains

[1/27/2025 7:19 PM] rsulfuratus
it has the full metadata

[1/27/2025 7:19 PM] Deciusmus
in our "inn in Castrella" case, these will all be "castrella"

[1/27/2025 7:19 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. the output handler only has access to: current home origin lastKnown

[1/27/2025 7:20 PM] Deciusmus
i missing that

[1/27/2025 7:20 PM] Deciusmus
i see

[1/27/2025 7:20 PM] Deciusmus
ah but it has the full whereabouts

[1/27/2025 7:22 PM] Deciusmus
so you could do something where if (whereabout.current.type = polity) but again, not sure how that helps you.

[1/27/2025 7:23 PM] Deciusmus
and so if you don't have a home, you could do something different

[1/27/2025 7:23 PM] Deciusmus
if the current has type polity it means it is a "different" current from home

[1/27/2025 7:23 PM] Deciusmus
I guess you could tell whether the current is the same as home or not

[1/27/2025 7:25 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah basically. i haven't taken the time to work out the full logic but i think just knowing type and location for each whereabout would let you pick out the right way to display every permutation

[1/27/2025 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
(i think)

[1/27/2025 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
for the simple case, e.g. whereabouts: Castrella current.location = home.location current.type = home.type = "home"

[1/27/2025 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
you only care about current and home anyway

[1/27/2025 7:27 PM] rsulfuratus
if current location = home.location but current.type != home.type, I think this can only happen when you set both region and polity

[1/27/2025 7:27 PM] rsulfuratus
in this case, you have a default option, say (full typeof string) (region)

[1/27/2025 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
if current location exists but home location is unknown, you have just polity

[1/27/2025 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
say region primary, polity seconardy

[1/27/2025 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so then you have a primary/secondary

[1/27/2025 7:29 PM] rsulfuratus
actually the default option being (full typeof string) (polity) is probably better because then you can override it with {type: region, location }

[1/27/2025 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
i didn't think that out in detail, but since we can set place-specific displayDefaults and then pass then to TokenParser in the output handler that seems feasible

[1/27/2025 7:30 PM] Deciusmus
I'm not sure how this piggybacks on display defaults and such

[1/27/2025 7:31 PM] rsulfuratus
depending on checking type and whether locations are the same

[1/27/2025 7:31 PM] rsulfuratus
that was where the primary/secondary comes from. basically you need four pre-specified display strings and then pass the right one to tokenparser

[1/27/2025 7:32 PM] Deciusmus
the problem I just realized is that this is going to break people in places

[1/27/2025 7:32 PM] Deciusmus
I'm not totally surehow this is simpler than just having the idea of a "region" and "polity" in the whereabouts (i.e. so whereabouts returns 6 strings rather than 4) and then just not having current/home for places at all (

[1/27/2025 7:32 PM] rsulfuratus
you could call them fullRegion, fullPolity, simpleRegion, simplePolity or something

[1/27/2025 7:33 PM] Deciusmus
which is not great

[1/27/2025 7:33 PM] Deciusmus
because we are piggybacking on home/current I think the current location line on a person will use the polity and the home line will use the region

[1/27/2025 7:34 PM] rsulfuratus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/rsulfuratus/1302_1_1_image.png.rrgqxk5tGI.png)

[1/27/2025 7:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, it does

[1/27/2025 7:35 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm

[1/27/2025 7:36 PM] rsulfuratus
this is a fundamental problem with allowing places to have multiple chains though, unless you figure out a way to combine the chains into a single line

[1/27/2025 7:38 PM] Deciusmus
well I think for any given place you probably know what the right chain should be from that place up, right?

[1/27/2025 7:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean this is back to primary/secondary

[1/27/2025 7:39 PM] Deciusmus
although actually

[1/27/2025 7:39 PM] Deciusmus
I just mean, that is the right place to fix it

[1/27/2025 7:39 PM] rsulfuratus
ah i see

[1/27/2025 7:39 PM] Deciusmus
I don't know

[1/27/2025 7:39 PM] rsulfuratus
how so?

[1/27/2025 7:39 PM] Deciusmus
not the Lyra page

[1/27/2025 7:39 PM] Deciusmus
I think that's up to the Voltara page

[1/27/2025 7:39 PM] rsulfuratus
well, for lyra, should it say "Based in Voltara, on the Northwest Coast" or "Based in Voltara, the Chardonian Empire"?

[1/27/2025 7:40 PM] Deciusmus
means current location, following home

[1/27/2025 7:40 PM] Deciusmus
means current location, following current all the way

[1/27/2025 7:40 PM] Deciusmus
I hate to add more letters after the : in current, but one option would be to just have an option for what to follow

[1/27/2025 7:41 PM] Deciusmus
letters just examples

[1/27/2025 7:43 PM] Deciusmus
alternatively, it is back to some idea on the frontmatter, i.e. primaryWhereabouts: polity

[1/27/2025 7:44 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the token is the simplest. based on a quick glance at your tokenparser updates i think you could just have a code like X mean follow the opoosite

[1/27/2025 7:44 PM] Deciusmus
alternatively, the whole idea of "polity" vs "region" is a bad idea. instead, it should just be type = primary and type = secondary

[1/27/2025 7:45 PM] rsulfuratus
although i do think the idea of region and polity might not be perfect

[1/27/2025 7:45 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. follows current, follows home

[1/27/2025 7:46 PM] Deciusmus
or really anything

[1/27/2025 7:46 PM] Deciusmus
the nice thing about type = primary and type = secondary is that it would work for watersheds as well

[1/27/2025 7:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe not too bad

it makes the dataview queries a bit trickier because you have to check both primary and secondary

[1/27/2025 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean the right way to do this is actually with a graph structure

[1/27/2025 7:49 PM] rsulfuratus
but that is too fiddly to code

[1/27/2025 7:52 PM] Deciusmus
I actually wonder if the whole thing would be easier if we didn't use whereabouts for polity at all

[1/27/2025 7:53 PM] Deciusmus
I guess it also goes back to your point earlier about "what do we want to do"

[1/27/2025 7:55 PM] Deciusmus
A clarifying set of questions might be: For Lyra, what is the right thing to show for her location? Voltara/Northwest Coast or Voltara/Chardonian Empire? Is the answer the same for a inn in Voltara? And some assumptions: On the Voltara page, we presumably want to see both "on the Northwest Coast" and "in the Chardonian Empire". We want to be able to do a "cities in Chardonian Empire" which should return Voltara We want to be able to do a "places in Northwest Coast" which should return Voltara

[1/27/2025 7:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that polity is usually the primary thing you care about

[1/27/2025 7:57 PM] Deciusmus
right I think that is probably true

[1/27/2025 7:57 PM] rsulfuratus
you can always click on Voltara for more

[1/27/2025 7:57 PM] rsulfuratus
so more useful to list Voltara, Chardonian Empire than Voltara, Northwest Coast

[1/27/2025 8:01 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly, you want buildings -> settlements -> subunits of realms -> realms

[1/27/2025 8:02 PM] rsulfuratus
and geographic feaure -> larger feature -> region, except when the geographic feature is wholly contained in a realm, and then you might go larger feature -> realm

[1/27/2025 8:03 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure it is ever useful to follow non-polity on a person page, unless you can't because the place isn't in a polity

[1/27/2025 8:03 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., you don't want: Songara plains -> Dunmari basin -> Greater Dunmar you want Songara plains -> Dunmari basin -> Dunmar or Songara plains -> Central Dunmar -> Dunmar

[1/27/2025 8:04 PM] Deciusmus
right

[1/27/2025 8:06 PM] Deciusmus
Voltara has primary = Chardonian Empire, secondary = Northwest Coast

[1/27/2025 8:06 PM] Deciusmus
I think primary/secondary would really work the best

[1/27/2025 8:07 PM] Deciusmus
which makes a lot more sense

[1/27/2025 8:07 PM] Deciusmus
So you get something like

[1/27/2025 8:08 PM] Deciusmus
or

[1/27/2025 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/27/2025 8:09 PM] Deciusmus
or

[1/27/2025 8:11 PM] Deciusmus
but actually the key thing is that the "secondary" location cannot be home or current

[1/27/2025 8:13 PM] Deciusmus
but then add the idea of type = secondary, which is another whereabouts piece (separate from home or current)

[1/27/2025 8:13 PM] Deciusmus
I think what you actually want is to revert all the changes I did (i.e. make it so that we always follow current in whereabout chains, no matter what)

[1/27/2025 8:14 PM] Deciusmus
(primary is a synonym for home)

[1/27/2025 8:38 PM] Deciusmus
Ok, primary/secondary works much much better

[1/27/2025 8:39 PM] Deciusmus
Just need to add a wSeconday display defaults

[1/27/2025 8:42 PM] Deciusmus

[1/27/2025 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
(meanwhile I am trying to get chatGPT to write a scene from A Fool's Fortune)

[1/27/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
here is the best version so far. I think it can do better with a bit of prompting: And a famous scene in [[A Fool's Fortune]] depicts the tragi-comic hero, Estelis, gleefully bargaining with a pixie who offers him a "crown of starlight," said to bestow the wearer with eternal respect and adoration. Estelis, overcome with visions of glory, eagerly hands over his entire purse of gold. The pixie solemnly places an ornate crown made of cobwebs and dew on his head, whispering that it is invisible to those unworthy of its power. Estelis, beaming with pride, parades around the stage, boasting of his newfound majesty, while the audience, well-versed in fey trickery, can barely contain their laughter.

[1/27/2025 8:44 PM] Deciusmus
that isn't awful

[1/27/2025 8:45 PM] Deciusmus
have you tried Deep Mind

[1/27/2025 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
way better than 3.5 or even 4.0

[1/27/2025 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i had to do some manual cleanup but it is amazingly good at (almost always) getting the rhyme and meter correct

[1/27/2025 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
this wasn't too bad as a sonnet: Beneath the boughs where twilight shadows play, The fey spin bright, their songs a siren’s call. Through glens of gold and meadows wrapped in gray, Their laughter weaves a spell to bind us all. The shifting woods bewitch all guiding light, As time dissolves within this haunted glade. No dawn will break to end eternal night, Where bargains made demand the price be paid. Fair beauty shrouds the thorn and hides the snare, With shimmering hues that veil a darker scheme. Beware, O heart, for wonder masks despair, And joy dissolves like mist within a dream. 'Neath shadowed skies, the endless whispers weave, The mournful songs of those who cannot leave.

[1/27/2025 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
this is better I think: In a pivotal scene from [[A Fool’s Fortune]], Estelis encounters a pixie offering to trade a “Field of Gold.” The pixie describes it with grandiose imagery: an endless plain of golden light, shimmering as far as the eye can see, where riches grow like grass and all who possess it are envied by kings. Entranced, Estelis cannot resist, and he offers a pouch of his finest gems to secure the deal. The pixie produces a delicate box, no larger than a hand, and insists the field lies within. “The gold is yours, fine merchant—just sow the seeds of your ambition, and it will flourish.” The audience, of course, recognizes the trap: inside the box lies nothing but a handful of dandelion seeds, whose blooms, in their fleeting moment, might appear golden in the sun

[1/27/2025 8:51 PM] Deciusmus
(I haven't read it yet)

[1/27/2025 8:53 PM] rsulfuratus
eh. kind of gobblegook. maybe some semi-interesting ideas but not strung together very well. what was the prompt?

[1/27/2025 8:54 PM] Deciusmus
write a scene from a play. Here is what I know about the play: It is called "A Fools' Fortune" It is about a merchant who gets lost in the Feywild and slowly loses all his money to a variety of fey tricksters, thinking he is getting richer and richer all the time. The Feywild is a fairy realm where various classic fey types live the play was written by a playwright in a city called Drankor * Drankor is full of secret societies and magic

[1/27/2025 8:55 PM] Deciusmus
A little to "secret society" oriented, but 3. The Vineyard of Vanity Aldemar meets a vintner (“elf” fey with ivy-crowned hair) selling wine that “reveals hidden desires.” Each sip erodes his memory of Drankor’s Society of Unveiled Accounts, replacing it with visions of himself as a king. He trades his ledger (his tether to reality) for a cask, unaware the wine turns to vinegar by dawn. The fey use the ledger to infiltrate Drankor’s secret economies.

[1/27/2025 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
of course it is cheating a little by having all my context working on feywild poems already

[1/27/2025 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
here's chatGPT with the same prompt

[1/27/2025 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
however it is tough to get the "thinks he's getting richer but actually getting poorer" vibe because it is not obvious actually what that means!

[1/27/2025 9:01 PM] Deciusmus
Aldemar stumbles into a fey-run “lottery” (hosted by elves in masquerade masks) where every ticket is free… but each one subtly steals an hour of his lifespan. The prizes are illusions: deeds to phantom estates, titles to forgotten kingdoms. He “wins” endlessly, celebrating his “good fortune” as he rapidly ages. The fey siphon his stolen time into hourglasses, selling it to Drankor’s secret societies.

[1/27/2025 9:01 PM] Deciusmus
how about this Aldemar encounters a fey “banker” (posing as a human financier) offering to exchange his “outdated” Drankor coins for Feywild currency that “doubles in value hourly.” He eagerly trades his purse, but unbeknownst to him, every Fey coin he accepts erases a memory of his past wealth. By scene’s end, he’s frantically counting shimmering coins, oblivious that he’s forgotten his own name, his ledger, and the Society of Unveiled Accounts’ warnings.

[1/27/2025 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i had a bunch of stuff like that earlier but i was trying to get more subtle irony. not an obvious con or a blatant curse

[1/27/2025 9:05 PM] Deciusmus
ok, secondary is working...

[1/27/2025 9:05 PM] Deciusmus
yeah

[1/27/2025 9:06 PM] Deciusmus
Basic idea: two new types on a whereabouts: primary and secondary primary is just an alias for "home" secondary is special - it is NEVER the current location, so basically it can only ever be the "secondary" location new displayDefaults: wSecondary defaults to "Located

[1/27/2025 9:07 PM] Deciusmus
(which is always primary)

[1/27/2025 9:07 PM] Deciusmus
chains (starting from either primary or secondary or home or current or whatever) always follow "current" location

[1/27/2025 9:07 PM] Deciusmus
the "inLocation" helper function finds things in both primary or secondary locations

[1/27/2025 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
and clean up the dm notes

[1/27/2025 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i still need to write something in-game about archfey and fey realms

[1/27/2025 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i pushed a nearly complete draft of the feywild page. definitely the most complicated

[1/27/2025 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
but would be helpful to get a sense if you think it is revealing too much or too little, what if anything you'd add to get the vibe to match your game

[1/27/2025 9:20 PM] Deciusmus
it doesn't reveal anything major I haven't told my players, for example

[1/27/2025 9:20 PM] Deciusmus
I think the page in general is a good level of detail

[1/27/2025 9:21 PM] Deciusmus
I might if I was inspired add a tyrwinghan sentence or two to the "people of the feywild" it feels like it has a bit of a Chardonian spin. But overallI like it a lot

[1/27/2025 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah hard to capture all the vibes. make kiya write a sentence or two for a tyrwinghan perspective

[1/28/2025 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
i am almost done with my multiverse rewrite - my goal is to get all this integrated into the next taelgarverse update this weekend. so i might work next on a bit of TOC and general reorg. the general goal is to clean up the taelgarverse TOC which I think is a bit too inclusive, and use more things like having a list of the mos numena gods on the pantheon page instead of having each god in the sidebar nav. as a side effect, i'm thinking about a few reorgs of the main obsidian vault. my main goals are: (1) I like the in-world style a lot but it is a lot of work (if enjoyable) and not always appropriate. i am wondering - but not settled - on whether it makes more sense to have in-world vs above-table directories to make it clearer what is what. (2) i increasingly think there are only a few directories where we want to copy the nav structure from the obsidian vault directly to markdown, which opens up more possibilities for an obsidian reorg (3) often find it faster to search for a file than pull it up in the nav, but obsidian's search is kind of terrible since it doesn't prioritize file names. this makes me want to reorg the directory structure to be faster to find things. (4) a lot of the directory structure was created early on and the kinds of pages we want/have have changed so it is worth a look to see if everything still makes sense a rough idea for a proposal follows

[1/28/2025 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
(footnotes in a bit)

[1/28/2025 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
unchanged: Background - canonical pages of worldbuilding background information; i think always written above-table, and never published Campaigns - campaign-specific player-facing information Worldbuilding - per recent reorg Things - canonical pages of things or classes of things that exist in world; generally written above-table, generally published with some exclusions (^1) People - canonical pages about people; generally written above-table, generally published with some exclusions, primary purose is a dramatis personae for games (^2) Gazetteer - canonical pages of places; written in a mix of styles but usually above-table or simple factual statements, generally published with some exclusions

[1/28/2025 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
possible changes: Cosmology - currently includes gods, planes, and religion; does not include religious festivals or holidays, and does not include gazetteer-style descriptions of locations on other planes (including fey realms or specific domains of shadow) Proposed new content - canonical in-world details about the other planes, and named powers of these planes (basically, the 'extraplanar powers' category moves here). religion moves elsewhere. Proposed new content 2 - just the multiverse. gods and religion move elsewhere, nothing new is added. entirely written in-world.

[1/28/2025 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
possible changes: Time - currently has the Calendar Eras page and then some religious stuff. maybe should just move calendar eras to Background and combined festivals with religion.

[1/28/2025 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
possible changes: Species - ideally I think this would have three kinds of content: overview pages of "species typologies", e.g. "elementals", "undead", "~Elder Folk~", written in-world style; player-facing overviews of playable races and common non-playable races in the style of the current elf/dwarf/etc page, written in a blend of above-table and in-world styles but focused on culture, lore, etc; player-facing non-mechanical / campaign-independent details about playing a species that focuses on "what you should think about re: this species" type things (e.g., names could go here, and some of the stuff in "Campaigns/mechanics"

[1/28/2025 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
complicated changes: History and Events are a huge muddle with no clear indication of what goes where. History has some overview pages, a few scattered undated events, and "historical places" (although "historical people" are in People). events has events organized by time, but some of the (e.g. the Riving) are unclear why they are here not History (or Cosmology). i'm not sure what to do here, exactly

[1/28/2025 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
complicated changes: Groups is basically "anything a person can be a part of, except religion". possibly this is fine and we shoud move religions here. it might be worth introducing a bit more of a top-level groups hierarchy for navigational purposes. e.g., could have: Religions, Cultures, Organizations, Families as top-level or something. Orc Hordes and Hobgobling Clans are possibly more equivalent to realms than anything else? Hard to say.

[1/28/2025 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
complicated changes: Primary Sources - I'm not sure this directory is worthwhile? the more we incorporate in-world descriptions into text the less sensible it feels to have primary sources segregated into a single directory. most of what is here is either songs (actually hard to place, but could be in background), stories that have been told in game (dunmari myths mostly, could be in history or dunmar or religion), stories for vibes (could go in species or whatever they are vibing about), books or letters with in-world text (could go in thiings)

[1/28/2025 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
footnotes: ^1: Things of course has some bleed-over into campaigns and perhaps should generally not be published? the distinction between "world magic items pages" and "campaign magic item pages" has always been a bit arbitrary but maybe that is fine

[1/28/2025 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
^2: Historical Figures, Extraplanar Powers, and PCs have always been slightly weird categories in People. I'm not sure I'd want to change them, just want to think a bit about whether this is fully correct. E.g., do Historical Figures belong in History? Do Extraplanar Powers belong in Cosmology (with gods, if gods remain in cosmology)? PCs probably stay but might belong in Campaigns?

[1/28/2025 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
feel free to dump random thoughts or just ignore this entirely for now

[1/28/2025 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
anyway - that is a huge wall of text and now i'm going to vanish for meetings for the next few hours. only goal during working hours today is finishing cosmology updates if I have time so won't push any more substantial updates. if i have a lot more time than I expect, I might write up a proposed "Purpose of Directories" document to try to solidify some of this brainstorming without committing to anything

[1/28/2025 11:55 AM] Deciusmus
A few thoughts.... **People**: I think the People folder should be reserved for dramatis persona style descriptions of individuals. The published information should read relatively in-world, i.e. what a PC would write if they were taking notes on everyone they encountered. Roleplaying notes or mechanics/leveled class type information should be ain a Campaign:None tag. - Powerful creatures who might have myths and legends about them should probably go in (TBD) but not people Historical people are a bit of a problem, as there are a few categories of historical people: - "important" people for whom it might be worth writing a few "in-world" style paragraphs (such and such scholar thinks they did blah, contradicted by... etc - examples might include Avatus, Asuddha, Cece I, Eudomes, Amloch) - "little" people who just happen to be dead or long dead. The only difference between these and regular people is that they died potentially a long time ago - but likely some part of them was encountered in game (i.e. Marius of Drankor or Celine Essford) - "rulers" people who have pages just to help track dynasties and regnal lists and what not (most people in Sembaran Royalty) - "staging" people who were invented just to have a name on a document or report (i.e. Adele Laurent or Ila or )

[1/28/2025 11:56 AM] Deciusmus
I think in general it is worth moving the "important" people to History the "staging" people to staging, and then having a People\Sembaran Royalty or whatever rather than a People\Historical Figures\Sembaran Royalty

[1/28/2025 11:57 AM] Deciusmus
and just have some pages in a different style

[1/28/2025 11:57 AM] Deciusmus
Alternatively, maybe it is better to just kinda have a loose organization under "People" for every page that reflects a specific meetable entity

[1/28/2025 11:59 AM] Deciusmus
Cosmology: I would make it just the multiverse. Make a separate top level folder for Relgion and move gods under each religion's section

[1/28/2025 12:00 PM] Deciusmus
Argueably groups should be in People

[1/28/2025 12:15 PM] Deciusmus
To expand a bit... I think we have basically three types of pages: "dramatis persona" style pages, which tend to be relatively short, frontmatter heavy, and similar in spirit to the type of thing you would write in a glossary or dramatis persona in a novel. "Wikipedia" style pages, which tend to be relatively long and cover in-world information from a position of omniscience. * "In-world" style pages, which is mostly just the stuff you have been doing for Multiverse, which is explicitly written from a position of uncertainity, and is written from the perspective of a research or highly educated person in world

[1/28/2025 12:16 PM] Deciusmus
I guess there is a fourth type which is "mechanics" pages, which are explicilty written to address player rather than character concerns. But these are fairly small I think

[1/28/2025 12:20 PM] Deciusmus
It might be better to say that we have 3 styles of "wikipedia" page: Pages written from the perspective of a "in-game" encyclopedia article: omniscient, in that it states the true facts about the world, not the theories or controversies, but character-facing, i.e. it is written in a way that would read basically sensibly to a character Pages written from the perspective of an "out-game" encyclopedia article: omniscient and character-facing but includes player-facing language (i.e. real world analogs or roleplaying advice or whatever) * Pages written from the perspective of a "author's note/meta" perspective

[1/28/2025 12:26 PM] Deciusmus
If I was looking for a radical reorganization I think I'd look at these types of things to help categorize. Would it make sense to do something like Cosmology: "in-world" pages about the multiverse, including any long speculative pages about certain people or places (but the key thing is these are all in the "in-world" style) Religion: "Wikipedia" and "dramatis persona" style pages, organized by specific religion, not type of god, about religious cultures and traditions, holidays, and gods (would potentially benefit from eventually having some more "in-world" pages written) Civilizations and Cultures: "Wikipedia" style articles about civilizations and cultures; no dramatis persona stuff here Gazeteer: "dramatis persona" style pages about places People: "dramatis persona" style pages about people and groups of people Species: "Wikipedia" and "in-world" style pages about species History: "wikipedia" and "in-world" style pages about the past Events: "dramastic persona" style pages about specific events

[1/28/2025 12:27 PM] Deciusmus
* Background: Wikipedia style pages written from a "author/meta" perspective

[1/28/2025 12:29 PM] Deciusmus
There are some grey areas: When does a basic page about a realm get "big enough" to move to Civilizations and Cultures from Gazetteer? When does a basic page about a archfey or fey domain get "in-world" enough to move to Cosmology from People or Gazetteer (and where does a long page describing the culture of Twilight's Grace go? Civilization and Cultures or Cosmology) * What is the line between "history" and "events"

[1/28/2025 12:30 PM] Deciusmus
Also the above doesn't touch on things at all

[1/28/2025 12:30 PM] Deciusmus
And some questions: Is it a good idea to split based on "Type of page" rather than "thing the page describes" Does it make sense to have the Sembara page or Dunmar page outside of Gazetteer?

[1/28/2025 12:31 PM] Deciusmus
Another grey area: does specieis or civilization and culture cover elvish civilization?

[1/28/2025 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
just to step back, i think the main goals of the directory structure in obsidian should be: (1) make it easy to do worldbuliding and session prep - it should be easy to find things without having to search. (2) facilitate "worldbuilding projects" by linking things you want to update together in on place (3) serve as a way to auto-generate navigation sidebars for subsets of the vaul that are largest published as-is

[1/28/2025 12:35 PM] Deciusmus
I am about to go get lunch then have a meeting but one quick thought -- for finding things I always just us the "find or create a note" feature, I never use the directory structure

[1/28/2025 12:36 PM] Deciusmus
Partly for (1) I find the diretory structure way too deep to be comfortable for cleenseau

[1/28/2025 12:36 PM] Deciusmus
and (3)

[1/28/2025 12:36 PM] Deciusmus
I find the directory structure very useful for (2) though

[1/28/2025 12:37 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. to get to Essford Manor is 6 levels deep. It is much easier to just type ess into the search and pick

[1/28/2025 12:38 PM] Deciusmus
but I like having a "Cleenseau Region" folder because I publish it as a top level sidebar nav from [https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/campaigns/cleenseau-campaign/cleenseau-campaign/](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/campaigns/cleenseau-campaign/cleenseau-campaign/ "https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/campaigns/cleenseau-campaign/cleenseau-campaign/")

[1/28/2025 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i actually didn't know about the find or create note feature, that is very helpful

[1/28/2025 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
it might actually be fine to just tackle directory reorganization piecemeal instead of all at once

[1/28/2025 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
but it would be nice to have documentation of folders that are "clean" and those that are not

[1/28/2025 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
in particular, I'm motivated to reorganize Cosmology, having just worked on it extensively, but not sure I want to decide about how History and Events are split up all in one big sweep

[1/28/2025 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i might make a new "Vault Organization" page to track things

[1/28/2025 12:49 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah that’s not a bad idea

[1/28/2025 12:50 PM] Deciusmus
I think we can agree that religion and gods should move to Religion folder as well as holidays

[1/28/2025 12:50 PM] Deciusmus
My motivation is Gazetter because I’m trying to go through each folder for each region as I do the landing pages

[1/28/2025 12:52 PM] Deciusmus
The open question would be should realm “big pages” move out of Gazetter

[1/28/2025 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd keep realm big pages in Gazetteer. if i'm working on a Chardonian Empire cleanup I want everything in one place

[1/28/2025 1:01 PM] Deciusmus
I’m not totally sure. If I’m working on trying to make a Dunmar style page on sembara I actually care more about religion and history than the details of a timber village in the barony of Aveil

[1/28/2025 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe that can be done manually

[1/28/2025 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
it is very annoying for taelgarverse though as I definitely want Dunmar to be the landing page for the Dunmar nav structure

[1/28/2025 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
hrm. maybe.

[1/28/2025 1:03 PM] Deciusmus
Ie keep the Gazetter page short “dramitis persona” style no matter what and link to a longer page

[1/28/2025 1:03 PM] Deciusmus
I was wondering if See more: [[Realm of Sembara]] is the best solution

[1/28/2025 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
ah. hmm. maybe

[1/28/2025 1:07 PM] Deciusmus
For example, if I started a project to better define the Zimkovan realms I’m not sure that the best way to tackle culture and religion and politics and government would be on the separate Ardlas/Breva/etc pages

[1/28/2025 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, for now, I think the big change that is obvious is we need a "Gods and Religion" top-level directory for gods, religions, and festivals, which then leads to cosmology having just multiverse stuff (for now) and time disappearing (with calendar eras -> background)

[1/28/2025 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/28/2025 1:09 PM] Deciusmus
I’m not even sure there has to be a single answer

[1/28/2025 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
am also going to type up a vault organization note.

[1/28/2025 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i am going to implement that, but leave any other major changes for now

[1/28/2025 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
okay pushed

[1/28/2025 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm pushing the reorg above now even though some things aren't perfect to prevent messy conflicts if you do anything this afternoon

[1/28/2025 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly working the rest of the afternoon so will be sporadic to reply

[1/28/2025 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed an in-progress Vault Organization page. lmk if you see anything that you don't agree with there

[1/28/2025 2:35 PM] Deciusmus
And Campaigns, modulo the open questions

[1/28/2025 2:35 PM] Deciusmus
Strong agreement on catagorization of page types and Background + Cosmology + Gods and Religions

[1/28/2025 2:59 PM] Deciusmus
Less sure about species. In general, the broad "species" topic contains: 1 Player-facing pages about playable species and mechanics 2 Meta pages about typologies and "how to make up new species" 3 in-world or character pages about odd/unusual/scary species ("enemies" broadly) 4 in-world or character pages about playable specieis 5 in-world or character pages about specific cultures or realms of playable species (?) Right now I think the lines between 4 and 5 are fairly unclear

[1/28/2025 3:01 PM] Deciusmus
I'm also not sure how pages about dwarven religion intersect with this

[1/28/2025 3:01 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. dwarven coins + dwarven kingdoms are kinda off in their own spots

[1/28/2025 3:04 PM] Deciusmus
also there are questions like "human cultures of taelgar" - is that in species?

[1/28/2025 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
hmmm

[1/28/2025 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i think 1-4 fit most obviously in species, with 5 fitting either in gazetteer or tbd

[1/28/2025 3:08 PM] Deciusmus
This is where I am starting to think a Civilizations and Cultures folder would help a lot

[1/28/2025 3:08 PM] Deciusmus
Sure

[1/28/2025 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't think it has to be perfect, and can be revised depending on how gazetteer ends up

[1/28/2025 3:09 PM] Deciusmus
it makes it easy to link out from other areas to a See more: Dwarven Culture

[1/28/2025 3:10 PM] Deciusmus
so then the rule could be we have a page but not a folder for each playable species in species

[1/28/2025 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe that's fine

[1/28/2025 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
it makes it a little arbitrary why history and religion are separate (history less arbitrary than religion)

[1/28/2025 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/28/2025 3:11 PM] Deciusmus
yes

[1/28/2025 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
elven cycle of generations could be in background, to be honest

[1/28/2025 3:11 PM] Deciusmus
and if you start wanting to have several different pages, link them to Civilizations and Cutlure/Elves/blah blah

[1/28/2025 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/28/2025 3:13 PM] Deciusmus
So I might say something like: The species folder should focus on global truths about a species - lifecycle, biology, special abilities, as well as 'big picture' history/culture/religion. Details about a specific culture ("sentinenls dwarven kingdoms", "people of the rainbow") or just longer articles about species goes in civ/

[1/28/2025 3:16 PM] Deciusmus
that means the species organization could be something like: Species/Mechanics/... Species/Extraplanar/... Species/Unusual/... Species/[Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Orcs, Hobgoblins, Halflings, Stoneborn, Lizardfolk]

[1/28/2025 3:17 PM] Deciusmus
and the mechanics/species and mechanics/species of taelar moves to specieis/mechanics

[1/28/2025 3:17 PM] Deciusmus
then languages moves to Civilization and Culture/Langauges

[1/28/2025 3:17 PM] Deciusmus
or maybe a "goblinoids" instead of hobgoblins, or a folder for "Evil" that includes goblins,etc + orcs

[1/28/2025 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think it is find to dump things in background for now, and the pull stuff out of background later

[1/28/2025 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, okay, i can get behind that. i am still a little lukewarm on civilizations and culture, and I'd kind of prefer to hold off big gazetteer reorgs until we finish the region reorg.

[1/28/2025 3:19 PM] Deciusmus
but it is easy to leave languages in species for now as well

[1/28/2025 3:19 PM] Deciusmus
thats fair, although the languages pages are valuable to publish

[1/28/2025 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
also update vault page as needed if you can

[1/28/2025 3:20 PM] Deciusmus
ok, I'm going to move around species but not introduce a civ + culture just ye

[1/28/2025 3:20 PM] Deciusmus
true

[1/28/2025 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
it is also easy to publish a specific background page, just need to update the ignore file to keep that page, and then manually add it to toc

[1/28/2025 3:39 PM] Deciusmus
species isn't really finished, but it has well defined content

[1/28/2025 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
i was moving things into finished if there is no further page reorganization to do, not if all the pages were finished.

[1/28/2025 3:42 PM] Deciusmus
there is still an open question, i.e. *Open Questions*: Where do larger pages about culture of species go, i.e. [[People of the Rainbow]], [[Dwarven Kingdoms]], or [[Story About Halfling Merchants]]

[1/28/2025 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe add an Open Questions at the bottom for things like that

[1/28/2025 3:44 PM] Deciusmus
I put "creating new species" in species\mechanics as it seemed to fit there

[1/28/2025 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
that is a slightly more complicated decision than the species org itself - i think we just decided they don't belong in species, so from the species point of view no open questions. but from a larger point of view those need a consistent home

[1/28/2025 3:45 PM] Deciusmus
and I'm keeping the duplicated landing pages - one at Species\Species which is "character facing" and one at Species\Mechanics\Species of Taelgar which is "player facing"

[1/28/2025 4:01 PM] Deciusmus
pushed

[1/28/2025 4:25 PM] Deciusmus
I'm working on Northwest Coast landing page... A few questions. Any you don't get to I'll add to doc with check/tim later tonight

[1/28/2025 4:26 PM] Deciusmus
Question 1: Non-humans. Any major non-human settlements other than salt lizardfolk on mawar?

[1/28/2025 4:26 PM] Deciusmus
(Northwest coast = basiclly Mawar + Voltara region).

[1/28/2025 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
major? nothing particularly canonically determined, but there probably are some somewhere

[1/28/2025 4:55 PM] Deciusmus
I guess it is kinda hard to write the gazetter landing page for this region in particular, because it isn't just a "mostly unknown" place like the far north or far south but it is also not very complete from a development standpoint

[1/28/2025 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't think it is necessary to completely preserve an in-world / character-facing writing style for the region pages

[1/28/2025 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
alternatively i think it is fine to write it as if the region were complete, and just add details as more stuff gets invented later on

[1/28/2025 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
(although i kind of like a signal of "empty because no one has invented stuff here" vs "empty because it is wiilderness" in the player-facing sections, not just dm notes)

[1/28/2025 5:03 PM] Deciusmus
I actually think it is mostly a problem with the Northwest Coast and the Western Green Sea

[1/28/2025 5:07 PM] Deciusmus
If I think about the "civilizations and cultures" for each region, I think we have: Far North: mystery/wilderness Northwest Coast: fuzzy North Sentinels: Deno'qai, stoneborn, dwarves but with a "wilderness" vibe Greater Sembara: extensive/well defined North Green Sea: Ursk + dwarves and stoneborn in the Svijnaro mountains + Vagardi + wilderness/mystery vibe Greater Chardon: I think well defined? I asume you have a decently clear idea of non-chardon cultures, if any Central Highlands: dwarves/elves/deno'qai/stoneborn some intentionally blank patches (Myrani Gap) Upper Istaros: Aurbez/Orenlas + mystery/wilderness Western Green Sea: very unclear Eastern Green Sea: intentionally blank Apporia + Nevos: Illoria + mystery/intentionally blank Dunmar: well defined Drankor: mystery/wilderness Far South: intentionally blank

[1/28/2025 5:09 PM] Deciusmus
the hardest regions to write are the two "mostly populated" regions that are not well characterized yet: Northwest Coast + Western Green Sea

[1/28/2025 5:09 PM] Deciusmus
Or to put it another way, regions are in general either "faraway civilizations", "wilderness + mystery", "wilderness + mystery with 1 or 2 well known civs", "mostly populated"

[1/28/2025 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i have a bit of a related problem with the shadowfolds - there is not much invented about them, almost nothing compared to e.g. energy realms or feywild, but they are not intentionally mysterious like e.g. some of the "outer planes" or the far realms. my current solution is sticking this at the bottom: *(While there is more to say about the Shadowfolds, and significant lore likely exists, it largely has not been invented yet! - Eds.)

[1/28/2025 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
i did all the easy planes already

[1/28/2025 5:26 PM] Deciusmus
my current solution is just to move on to a different region

[1/28/2025 5:31 PM] Deciusmus
is that canonical, i.e. that there is something out there that impacts the climate/currents/etc of the near Endless Ocean?

[1/28/2025 5:31 PM] Deciusmus
here is a question: the current climate of the western Endless Ocean is heavily influenced by the existence of the sayuna islands, which diverts the major currents far to the north and south, and makes the main coast something like the Tasman Sea between australias and new zealand

[1/28/2025 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
the climate of the landmasses (Mawar, north Apporia, Chardon coast) is canonical. why the climate is the way it is is not

[1/28/2025 5:34 PM] Deciusmus
I don't think it really has

[1/28/2025 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure that current map has ever had much of an impact on worldbuilding

[1/28/2025 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd probably just link to green sea page

[1/28/2025 6:18 PM] Deciusmus
how much do you think it makes sense to put the general climate of the green sea on the eastern and western pages, or should I just add a climate sectio on the Green Sea page and link?

[1/28/2025 6:26 PM] Deciusmus
ok, I pushed completed Far North, Far South, Eastern Green Sea landing pages

[1/28/2025 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly doing non-taelgar stuff tonight, but a brief comment, trying to finalize the cosmology folder. i'm generally leaving things in (or moving to) staging if there both no invented in-game detail and no relevant dm notes (e.g., the sun) i'm leaving things as player-facing stubs, with excludePublish["all"], if there are relevant dm notes even if there is no player facing text (e.g., the moon, the stars)

[1/28/2025 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
(also with excludePublish"all"

[1/28/2025 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm also going to make a ["meta"] cosmology landing page that will have all the notes in staging linked from cosmology, as well as some general guidance on tagging and categorization for the folder.

[1/28/2025 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
(might not get to any of this tonight)

[1/28/2025 8:22 PM] Deciusmus
sure; I like staging as a landing zone for basically pages that are created to have a place for brainstorming/thoughts/etc but that are not really ready yet

[1/28/2025 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
(but not everything has to be organized the same way)

[1/28/2025 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i think what i'm going for will be obvious once i finish and push everything. basically, imo, staging is for pages that definitely exist but which don't have any text. if there are a bunch of dm notes, i'm moving them to the correct folder with excludePublish["all"]

[1/28/2025 10:10 PM] Deciusmus
I am about to go to bed, but I've been messing around with Chardonian history, specifically trying to write a unified narrative that works with the Conclave War, Apporian history, and Mawar History. Here is what I have so far: #### The Great War and the Blood Years DR 1540 - DR 1574 Although the [[Great War]] ended in DR 1545, the vast army of [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] and other terrors that [[Cha'mutte]] had amassed did not simply disappear. Over the next 30 years, two major wars were fought across the lands north of Chardon: the [[Conclave War]] and the to be named war against the hobgoblins. basic idea: conclave war then in the 1560s a series of expansion of hobgoblins, stopped in 1561 or 1562, but not really peaceful - next 10 years are back and forth along the north chardon coast; but in 1574 some type of armistace line is drawn, splitting (or even leaving the hobgoblins with most of the coast). Perhaps there is another human kingdom involved here (the "yellow 5 kingdom from other maps"?) in the north, pincering the hobgoblins a bit. chardon is settling chasa valley here #### Early Imperial Era DR 1574 - DR 1597 During mawar renai; hobgoblins are stilla round the malakel entrance, but somewhat hemmed in by something in the north so don't really have a good expansion plan; perhaps even being somewhat decent rulers in a way; chardon growing in the chasa valley but not really an empire just yet DR 1597, when the Umbral Covenant launches the Shadow Armada to conquer Chardon, and loses badly - awakening moment - empire is working this is not like the conclave war at all leads to first serious wave of expansion #### Imperial Expansion DR 1597 - present three phases: apporia - 1597 - 1610 1650 - 1675 - conquest of hobgoblins; (mindknife war just after this) * 1690 - 1710 - chaylte

[1/28/2025 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus
there are some significant details in various of my notes in various places, and also some unwritten notes on modern day chardonian empire that may determine how history plays out.

[1/28/2025 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
(the dates don't have to be exactly right)

[1/28/2025 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g.: Current magistros, [[Mitus Verina Auratan]]. Comes from a powerful family; his aunt, Seva Auratan, was magistros before him, and her grandfather discovered chalyte in the north making the family super rich. Timing: Seva dies (aged 71), Mitus becomes Magistros: 1746 Mitus born: 1725 Seva becomes Magistros: 1720 Appius dies: 1703 First chalyte mines in north established; Voltara garrison built: 1680s Seva born: 1675 Seva's grandfather discovers chalyte in north: 1671 Appius Auratan (Seva's grandfather) born: 1620 So, basically, the Auratan family in the mid 1600s is not particularly notable. Appius Auratan, Seva's grandfather, has some magical training (perhaps retired from the mage guard) and is a bit of an adventurer, and makes the discovery of rich chalyte lodes in the mountains near what is now Voltara. Returns to Chardon and with the profits of his first haul starts a mining company.

[1/28/2025 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[1/28/2025 10:24 PM] Deciusmus
That actually lines up with my timeline almost exactly

[1/28/2025 10:25 PM] Deciusmus
Basically I was taking the Mawar and aporia history as canon and trying to figure out how that fits with Chardon

[1/28/2025 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the big unsettled things are the lake valandros area and the yeraad river valley

[1/28/2025 10:26 PM] Deciusmus
The big thing is that Chardon can’t be a powerful force on Mawar doorstep until the 1650s-1680s

[1/28/2025 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus
this is when incorporated into chardonian empire

[1/28/2025 10:28 PM] Deciusmus
I think for the grand scheme of historical eras it doesn’t matter when lake valandros or Yeraad is settled necessarily

[1/28/2025 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe swapping Valandros and North Coast

[1/28/2025 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus
in my head the current day empire is basically 6 pieces: Apporia Chasa Yeraad North Coast Valandros Voltara with an order of: Chasa -> Apporia -> Valandros -> North Coast -> Voltara (with Yeraad unclear)

[1/28/2025 10:29 PM] Deciusmus
Without changing the dates of the Mawar renaissance at least

[1/28/2025 10:29 PM] Deciusmus
I don’t think the north coast can be incorporated earlier than 1650s

[1/28/2025 10:29 PM] Deciusmus
North coast matters re: Mawar

[1/28/2025 10:29 PM] Deciusmus
Or rather incorporated

[1/28/2025 10:30 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a bit of tension here since my original idea (which you either independently invented or was in notes somewhere) is that it takes chardon a long time to get strong enough to break the hold of hobgoblins on the north coast

[1/28/2025 10:31 PM] Deciusmus
Which I think is ok actually

[1/28/2025 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
so that puts mawar renaissance at the same time as "hobgoblin kingdoms to the south"

[1/28/2025 10:31 PM] Deciusmus
Right that was in your notes

[1/28/2025 10:32 PM] Deciusmus
As long as the hobgoblins are hemmed in somehow, not expansionist

[1/28/2025 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
actually the hobgoblins maybe get cut off a bit at this stage. still harass chardon to south (and east?) but mawar renaissance reinvigorates the north, e.g. the "remnant yellow kingdoms"

[1/28/2025 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
right. mawar is protected by mountains via land, and can easily posulate that mawar is by far the better navy than hobgoblins

[1/28/2025 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
whereas the voltara area does not - chardon is much more of an imperial power here

[1/28/2025 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
the modern day vibe that is important to keep is that the north coast, chasa, and apporia are all basicaly loyal imperialists and still think of chardon as their saviors

[1/28/2025 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus
lake valandros and yeraad being undetermined as i'm not yet clear who actually lives there now

[1/28/2025 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
(but no details exist about this culture)

[1/28/2025 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
however, voltara has always in the great library game been an isolated frontier with most of the population density actually to the west, basically along the coast in "yellow kingdom 5", which I think is definitely not ever chardonian

[1/28/2025 10:37 PM] Deciusmus
(AFK fora bit)

[1/28/2025 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
(other than the voltara vibe)

[1/28/2025 10:40 PM] Deciusmus
Then hobgoblins come south, bypassing yellow 5 for whatever reason (and Mawar because of mountains + magic fog)

[1/28/2025 10:40 PM] Deciusmus
Right but that all fits. Basically the idea is— yellow kingdom 5 survives along the coast during the conclave war - basically as the only survivor of northern non-Drankorian kingdoms.

[1/28/2025 10:41 PM] Deciusmus
Between 1556 and 1565 or whatever Chardon fights to major wars (expansionist hobgoblin and conclave), but is exhausted after that

[1/28/2025 10:42 PM] Deciusmus
Maybe a few small skirmishes and reclamation of some territory along the coast

[1/28/2025 10:42 PM] Deciusmus
1570s-1590s are basically growth in the Chasa River valley. With hobgoblins still along the north coast but in some kind of holding pattern/stalemate

[1/28/2025 10:43 PM] Deciusmus
By ~1595 Mawar sees hobgoblins as relatively weak and the Mawar renaissance starts. Chardon also has grown but now and see itself as a strong power for the first time when it crushes the umbral convent

[1/28/2025 10:44 PM] Deciusmus
But Mawar and Chardon are still separated by the hobgoblins along the north coast, and kinda growing independentally. Chardon starts a series of expansions

[1/28/2025 10:45 PM] Deciusmus
And the voltara expansion(last) is clearly for chaylte

[1/28/2025 10:45 PM] Deciusmus
Whatever the exact timing, the expansion towards the north coast is clearly “saving them from hobgoblins” whereas the lake expansion is less clear

[1/28/2025 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah it seems to all roughly fit nicely on a high level

[1/28/2025 10:47 PM] Deciusmus
Anyway going to bed. But might mess around tomorrow depending on my workload

[1/29/2025 3:35 PM] Deciusmus
I've been working too much today so taking a little break to think some more about Chardonian history... it wouldn't do to work the entire day on work...

[1/29/2025 3:44 PM] Deciusmus
Here's the version I have so far, slightly modified from last night, and trying to leave the right "blank spaces" while still being a solid framework. **Great War and Blood Years** In Chardon this is basically 1545 - 1597 (the defeat of the Umbral Covenant being the conventional "end of the Blood Years") in Chardon at least. There are a couple of major things happening here: 1548(ish) - 1558(ish): Conclave War. Wipes out all human civilizations north of Lake Valandros and east of the coastal mountains, although it doesn't necessarily kill all the humans. 1550s - 1560s: Hobgoblin advance. Methodically moves south along the North Chardon Coast. 1545 - 1590ish: Mawar fog/isolation. 1559 - 1584: Apporian pirate kingdoms 1584 - 1597: War of the Dark Rift post 1560: settlement of Chasa River valley by Chardonians

[1/29/2025 3:47 PM] Deciusmus
By the end of this period, the following things need to be true: Mawar feels safe enough to dismiss the fog Chardon starts to become truly imperial, absorbing the Approian provinces in the aftermath of the War of the Dark Rift

[1/29/2025 3:48 PM] Deciusmus
Unclear: * What is happening in the Yeraad river

[1/29/2025 3:48 PM] Deciusmus
The following things should not have happened yet: * Chardon absorbs/conqueors the North Chardon coast, Lake Valandaros, of Voltara

[1/29/2025 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm pretty busy today but a few quick thoughts

[1/29/2025 4:09 PM] Deciusmus
So I just was reading up on this in various chats/docs

[1/29/2025 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
(1) It is probably useful to sketch out a little more clearly the "state of play" w/r/t hobgoblins in 1545. the major concentrations of Cha'mutte's armies are in the Dunmar/Isingue border area, and in Pandar, with scattered concentrations elsewhere. a part of the southern armies (Iron Fang) move quickly against Sembara and are defeated in the Bloodlust War the rest of the southern armies establish on the eastern frontier of Dunmar and are involved in a series of wars from 1550s - 1610 the northern armies are canonically larger and also potentially more desparate, as one must presume that pandar does not have the agricultural capacity to feed a large army without magic. the shattered ice clan moves against sembara across the mountains in the 1570s in some notes (timing is around 1st hobgoblin war), but in other notes the shattered ice clan is not involved in the 1st hobgoblin war. there is a semi-canonical idea they were somehow pushed over the mountains by chardonian expansion but i'm not sure the geography works super well.

[1/29/2025 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
dated way back the original idea of the "Blood Years" was basically, Cha'mutte is defeated but his armies are not, so this all works well, but the exact movements are a little ambiguous at the moment and fairly important to post-Great War history of the west coast

[1/29/2025 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Which also plays into west coast history

[1/29/2025 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
A related point: where are hobgoblins now?

[1/29/2025 4:12 PM] Deciusmus
The semi-canonical view is: **Southern army becomes Iron Fang + Bitter Knife** Iron Fang is defeated quickly by Sembara but only partially, and becomes the mad scientist plagueland hobgoblins (who are still around) Bitter Knife has a longer series of wars against Dunmar, but is defeated more throughouly **Northern army splits into 2 branches, the "western north" branch and the "eastern north" branch** Eastern north branch is the key troops of the conclave war. Defeated by Chardon in the 1550s/1560 timeframe they regroup and push west over the mountains into Sembara in the 1570s to be the first hobgoblin war in Sembar western north tbd

[1/29/2025 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
Currently the world vibe in ongoing campaigns has not had major hobgoblin wars as a theme, so they are probably pretty scattered but not likely extinct

[1/29/2025 4:14 PM] Deciusmus
and move into the foothills of the sentinels, lick their wounds, and then cross near urlich to attack dunmore area

[1/29/2025 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is the point I was confused on

[1/29/2025 4:14 PM] Deciusmus
for the eastern north, I think the geography works pretty well. they are defeated by Chardon in the chasa valley

[1/29/2025 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
So all three hobgoblin wars are same group on sembara?

[1/29/2025 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes. That is what is was reading

[1/29/2025 4:15 PM] Deciusmus
The Shatted Ice page actually contradicts that

[1/29/2025 4:15 PM] Deciusmus
But yes, to answer your question, all 3 hobgoblin wars were shatted ice

[1/29/2025 4:15 PM] Deciusmus
in some earlier conversations the stone titan one-shot was in the opening wars of the 1st hobgoblin war, where the hobgoblins were allied with mind flayers

[1/29/2025 4:16 PM] Deciusmus
yes

[1/29/2025 4:16 PM] Deciusmus
I never updated the shattered ice page after that convo

[1/29/2025 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
This is basically the group that flees the conclave war defeat

[1/29/2025 4:16 PM] Deciusmus
the discord chat - grand sweep of history wa the last time we did this

[1/29/2025 4:16 PM] Deciusmus
But the history timeline and the long discord chat from 2 years ago changed that

[1/29/2025 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
But all of them as shattered ice works much better

[1/29/2025 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Currently maybe hiding in small bands in marginal terrain in the sentinels and occasionally raiding but clearly significantly reduced in impact and power. And also maybe in conflict with whatever east sentinel hobgoblin clans managed to hide from cha’mutte

[1/29/2025 4:18 PM] Deciusmus
By 1740s unclear but the situation could have just continued

[1/29/2025 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
So to go back to west coast history, a major decision point is are there hobgoblins here now. Since that will determine history of the western advance

[1/29/2025 4:18 PM] Deciusmus
Right. My 1720s vibe is that the western army still fights scattered hobgoblin raiders but it is a very unequal fight

[1/29/2025 4:19 PM] Deciusmus
Right. I think the whole "post cha'mutte" hobgoblin stuff is pretty settled except: where did the blackened claw clan that fought around Raven's Hold come from? what happened to the "west north" branch who were not part of the conclave war

[1/29/2025 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
The only things we are sure of about the west advance is it lagged the conclave war for some reason, it was less destructive (more conquering, less dragonfire), and it took a while for Chardon to gain strength to win a series of campaigns

[1/29/2025 4:21 PM] Deciusmus
the "southern sentinel" ones are the descendants of the Shattered Ice clan

[1/29/2025 4:21 PM] Deciusmus
then separately, there are known hobgoblin settlements in the plaguelands ("Iron Fang -> mad scientist, but they are keeping to themselves brewing challenges for a level 18 party) and in the southern sentinels just soth of urlich, in the headwaters of the Yeraad River and probably in the spur stretching out towards Maseau

[1/29/2025 4:22 PM] Deciusmus
Right

[1/29/2025 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
(plus the realm on Irrla)

[1/29/2025 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yes. so basically to date, the canonical hobgoblins are mostly either (a) hiding in the plaguelands doing their thing, or (b) scattered, small groups eking out a living marginal terrain around the edges of the sentinels, which based on my very very very old notes is more or less a return to the pre-Great-War status quo except with the hogoblins weaker and more disoganized

[1/29/2025 4:28 PM] Deciusmus
+ northern plaguelands (Iron Fang)

[1/29/2025 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
in the immediate aftermath of the Great War, however, you have three major areas of hobgoblin settlement: - Chardon north coast (??? tbd) - southern Greater Sembara (Shattered Knife) - Nashtkar / western plaguelands area (this is where Bitter Knife and Blackened Claw hobgobilns come from)

[1/29/2025 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
however, you don't ever really get hobgoblin settlement on the eastern side of the west coast (the "Conclave War" path). in part because the Conclave War is in some sense a war of revenge against the elves/humans/Chardon and is intentionally destructive, in part because Chardon wins much more decisively in the end

[1/29/2025 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/29/2025 4:33 PM] Deciusmus
where the red is movement is the grey is settlement

[1/29/2025 4:33 PM] Deciusmus
so I think it is somthing like this:

[1/29/2025 4:35 PM] Deciusmus
better version

[1/29/2025 4:35 PM] Deciusmus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/994_1_1_image.png.zQWsE3GGzZ.png)

[1/29/2025 4:36 PM] Deciusmus
the open questions are then all basically around 4 = where did they come from? where did they go?

[1/29/2025 4:36 PM] Deciusmus
N = northern army splits into 3 = shattered ice, still around 4 = ???

[1/29/2025 4:36 PM] Deciusmus
S = southern army splits into 1 = iron fang (still around) and 2 = bitter knife/blackened claw (defeated by dunmar)

[1/29/2025 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/29/2025 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
so then if we look at this map

[1/29/2025 4:42 PM] Deciusmus
what if they sailed across the north bay, tried to land in mawar, were pushed away by the fog, and made their away around to the north chardon coast

[1/29/2025 4:42 PM] Deciusmus
I half wonder if they didn't come from the ocean

[1/29/2025 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it implies there is some kind of split early on in cha'mutte's armies basically as soon as cha'mutte dies

[1/29/2025 4:43 PM] Deciusmus
that could work too, although the "go around mawar" could be a reason they are delayed compared to the conclave war

[1/29/2025 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
in my original map i have them coming across the bay and through the gap between tawir forest and the mountains

[1/29/2025 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
also, keep in mind that by 1545, Cha'mutte has already conquered probably as far south as the [[blackwater fens]]

[1/29/2025 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right but that isn't going to delay them for 5 years or whatever

[1/29/2025 4:44 PM] Deciusmus
it also makes it easier for "who knows" type answers - they appeared on the coast.

[1/29/2025 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
so the yellow "kingdom 4" is already subjugated or destroyed

[1/29/2025 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but actions of the high school campaign force an accelerated timeline so just dumps a bunch of hobgoblins in the pass via magic shadow portals

[1/29/2025 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
a reasonable story is that cha'mutte is originally intending to move the north army south and the south army north to conquer both sides of ulrich pass for whatever reason the "monastery" is so important to the kill the gods goal

[1/29/2025 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so i think the most likely starting point is that, when the Great War ends in 1545, Pandar effectively covers the "Cha'mutte arrows", the forest of dreams, and "kingdom 4"

[1/29/2025 4:49 PM] rsulfuratus
but it isn't like the [[blackwater fens]] is great agricultural land either

[1/29/2025 4:49 PM] rsulfuratus
a side point is that when cha'mutte dies there is a major kenku revolt in pandar. and without magic pandar probably becomes pretty inhospitable, certainly not a place that can support anything close to the popuation density living there in the 1530s or whenever

[1/29/2025 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
my feeling is the most likely reason for the delay is actually that hobgoblins set up an early hobgoblin kingdom in Voltara area, more or less

[1/29/2025 4:53 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a bunch of tentative history from the Great Library campaign, involving Airion the Mistspeaker (who shows up a lot in various places immediately pre Great War) and a hint of a war that the people in kingdom 2 at least, maybe 1/2/5, fought and lost against hobgoblins where they were angry that chardon didn't come to their aid

[1/29/2025 4:56 PM] Deciusmus
Right so basically whatever is going on up north 1545 - 1560 it (a) spawns the conclave wars

[1/29/2025 4:57 PM] Deciusmus
(b) delays the "Unnamed West" hobgoblins (c) wipes out all of the human realms although potentially not (yellow kingdom 5) and potentially not all of the humans (i.e. some scattered refugees are potentially around to form new kingdoms to be conquered by chardon)

[1/29/2025 4:58 PM] Deciusmus
by late 1550s the "unnamed west" hobgoblins are moving south (for potentially unclear reasons) and methodically conqueor the north chardon coast

[1/29/2025 4:59 PM] Deciusmus
and you end up with a bit of frozen conflict, like in sembara

[1/29/2025 4:59 PM] Deciusmus
in 1565 or so some battle is fought perhaps along one of the unnamed rivers (farthest south one?) that halts the advance

[1/29/2025 5:01 PM] Deciusmus
that kinda leaves Lake Valandros and north as a "no mans land" and easy to leave blank for whatever we want to show up there later

[1/29/2025 5:01 PM] Deciusmus
so in 1565 you have: (a) a relatively large hobgoblin empire stretching all along the north coast (b) formally at peace with Chardon (c) which has defeated the Conclave hobgoblins and is rapidly expanding up the chasa river (d) some scattered humans - perhaps even a coherent kingdom - in the coast of the north bay (e) the defeated conclave hobgoblins licking their wounds to the east

[1/29/2025 5:03 PM] Deciusmus
or (c) Mawar to never have been worried about the hobgoblin empire per se, but to have other reasons to stay in the fog in 1570s but not by 1590s

[1/29/2025 5:03 PM] Deciusmus
then, you need either (a) Mawar to open up earlier (I think not great for the Mawar timeline) or (b) something to change by the 1590s so that the hobgoblin empire doesn't seem as much of a threat as it was in the 1570s

[1/29/2025 5:04 PM] Deciusmus
(My preference is b but I don't have a strong idea as to what that could be)

[1/29/2025 5:12 PM] Deciusmus
Right. The 3rd bullet could pretty easily just be "finally strong enough" via the successful Apporia campaign

[1/29/2025 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
right, got distracted by work, my basic thought is: (1) what happens up north 1545-1560 can be left blank (after all human historians might not know much about it, although perhaps rumors/minor details of the war that i tentatively invented for Great Library exist) (2) conclave war timeline is basically settled, as this was largely developed for the chasa river / elderwood arc anyway. it is the conclave war that destroys elven kingdoms and spans shattered ice, etc. (3) there are three key events that affect the western hobgoblins, which are currently unknown in nature but have clear impacts: - in late 1550s,+/-, something leads hobgoblins to advance south, probably through the tawir forest / mountains gap, starting an advance that is ended by a stalemate with chardon sometime in the late 1550s, perhaps. - there is something that changes the dynamic between mawar and hobgoblins that allows the mawar renaissance to flourish starting in the 1590s - there is something that changes the dynamic betwen chardon and the hobgoblins that causes chardon to launch a series of campaigns north, eventually defeating the hobgoblins (exact timing unclear, but shouldn't start before 1600 and shouldn't end after ~1650 or so, most like)

[1/29/2025 5:13 PM] Deciusmus
I'm envisioning something like the smashing defeat of the Umbral Conventant teaches Chardon it is strong

[1/29/2025 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that is probably the most straightforward

[1/29/2025 5:14 PM] Deciusmus
and it becomes very popular to start seeing the empire as the savoir of all these scattered people. So the north chardonians, who are after all still (a) alive and (b) Drankorian become this cause that cannot be abandoned

[1/29/2025 5:15 PM] Deciusmus
Details and reasoning honestly doesn't have to be worked out, but it doesn't seem like a hard problem to solve. For the history page I was basically going to write a "Early Imperial Expansion Era" that is basically Apporia + North Chardon coast, 1600-1650, with pretty vague details

[1/29/2025 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
right, i think there is a nice arc where: (a) conclave war nearly results in destruction of chardon and terrifies people (b) chardon is isolatist for a while, basically growing up the river but neither a naval or major military power (c) umbral convenant / war of the dark rift forces them to rearm, and find they are strong (d) after freeing apporia the obvious next step is the hobgoblins

[1/29/2025 5:17 PM] Deciusmus
Right

[1/29/2025 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that is where I was going next

[1/29/2025 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that tells a nice story about the chardonian empire and the relatively well developed parts of history (chasa river / elderwood / elves; apporia; mawar; north chardon coast), pending the questions about the hobgoblins

[1/29/2025 5:18 PM] Deciusmus
For the Mawar renaissace to really work, you actually want voltara and the north bay coast to be relatively safe by the early 1600s

[1/29/2025 5:19 PM] Deciusmus
but you have trade flows like:

[1/29/2025 5:19 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. the hobgoblins in the north chardon coast are really the last danger in the area, in a way

[1/29/2025 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/29/2025 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
this picture still leaves the history of the voltara area south through lake valandros northern coast pretty undeveloped (basically, 1, 2, and 5 of the yellow kingdoms)

[1/29/2025 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[1/29/2025 5:21 PM] Deciusmus
along that southern blue road

[1/29/2025 5:21 PM] Deciusmus
and chardon is busy building a road through the Tawir gap instead of helping

[1/29/2025 5:21 PM] Deciusmus
then imagine the Mindknife War is something from the north, i.e. the two blue arrows pointing at Mawar:

[1/29/2025 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
for lake valandros, i think that the east coast is caught up in the conclave war and was historically probably elven or denoqai anyway, and can be left relatively open-ended

[1/29/2025 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
it is likely / possible that chardon is fighting some other wars at this point

[1/29/2025 5:22 PM] Deciusmus
right

[1/29/2025 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
the exact dates of the mindknife wars could be adjusted slightly, but this should be into chardon's newly expansionist era where it is starting to look to secure chalyte resoruces

[1/29/2025 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
in the Great Library campaign, there is human settlement south of Voltara, and possibly non-Chardonian cities along the coast

[1/29/2025 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
possibly. or whatever is there

[1/29/2025 5:23 PM] Deciusmus
you mean against the human kingdoms in voltara region?

[1/29/2025 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
the vibe has also been that voltara is a frontier, and that the long road to lake valandros is fairly dangerou

[1/29/2025 5:24 PM] Deciusmus
Right; those coastal cities work well as the remains of yellow kingdom 5, and a big tradiing partner with mawar during the renaissance

[1/29/2025 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
but there is nothing really north of voltara except orcs, hobgoblins, and kobolds

[1/29/2025 5:25 PM] Deciusmus
so here is my northern hobgoblin map

[1/29/2025 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but amani (yellow kingdom 2, on the voltara plains) is completely destroyed

[1/29/2025 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
so they need to survive somehow the early hobgoblins

[1/29/2025 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the coastal region is probably not part of the chardonian empire at the moment and is likely a non-drankorian culture

[1/29/2025 5:26 PM] Deciusmus
that outlines I think the 4 options to get hobgoblins to the north chardon coast

[1/29/2025 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
possibly in the non-quite canonical war that chardon doesn't help with

[1/29/2025 5:27 PM] Deciusmus
#1 A - split is far north, head west and sail directly south #1 B - split is far north, head west, stop on the big island off mawar, then go south #2 A and B - similar, but not so far north #3 go from voltara area direct #4 settle in voltara for a while then go direct

[1/29/2025 5:29 PM] Deciusmus
the red region to have been decimated the black to be hobgoblins

[1/29/2025 5:29 PM] Deciusmus
but really we are saying we need, by say 1600:

[1/29/2025 5:30 PM] Deciusmus
the yellow to be a recognizeable human culture with connection back to pre-Great War

[1/29/2025 5:31 PM] Deciusmus
I think hobgoblins coming by sea really works better

[1/29/2025 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
(And with the decimation of elven kingdoms in forests not shown

[1/29/2025 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah basically with possibly yellow on north coast of lake valansros too

[1/29/2025 5:32 PM] Deciusmus
if you have the conclave war hobgoblins basically going like:

[1/29/2025 5:33 PM] Deciusmus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/917_1_1_image.png.gWDCRDGkqG.png)

[1/29/2025 5:33 PM] Deciusmus
or actually

[1/29/2025 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I was actually going to propose basically that except the center group does not join conclave war

[1/29/2025 5:35 PM] Deciusmus
the east hobgoblins are the Conclave true believers and march south

[1/29/2025 5:35 PM] Deciusmus
basically make there be 3 strands: - west - center - east The center hobgoblins are less enthralled to the dragon Conclave and kinda stop along the way and maybe fight some wars against the humans and settle for a while before being pushed out. But fundamentally Chardon only encounters them as part of the Conclave War (but they are the key enemy in the "unnamed war that destroyed Amini) and also maybe the key group that still exists around the north of voltara/west of fens

[1/29/2025 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
If you have three hobgoblin strands - revenge/conclave, brutal/violent, and conquerors

[1/29/2025 5:36 PM] Deciusmus
right, sure, that works too

[1/29/2025 5:36 PM] Deciusmus
the west hobgoblins come to the north coast from the sea, bypassing whatever human settlements there are on the north coast

[1/29/2025 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Then the defeat of the brutal/violent group can potentially be trigger for Mawar renaissance

[1/29/2025 5:38 PM] Deciusmus
1 = conqueors 2 = brutal/violent 3 = revenge/conclave

[1/29/2025 5:38 PM] Deciusmus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/909_1_1_image.png.NatjMTT1ks.png)

[1/29/2025 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
Right something like that

[1/29/2025 5:42 PM] Deciusmus
then you have the brutal/violent in the middle and human refugees fleeing in the blue

[1/29/2025 5:42 PM] Deciusmus
slight tweak: (making the conquerers on the southwest shore of lake valandros)

[1/29/2025 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
A few other considerations: - conquerors here would presumably have a strong navy initially, but this has to disappear for Mawar renaissance to make sense - this puts Mawar in a slightly different light, basically abandoning the light blue people

[1/29/2025 5:43 PM] Deciusmus
not sure what makes the brutal hobgoblins go away but you could end up with 2 or 3 human cultures regrouping after they vanish, and looking to Mawar as the main cultural touchstone in the region

[1/29/2025 5:44 PM] Deciusmus
One idea: maybe Mawar drops the fog to lead the fight against the brutal/violent hobgoblins

[1/29/2025 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Hmm. Maybe. Also i think the lake valandros hills are a good place for lots of ruins and such so probably that would imply pushing the light blue southwest and the brutal hobgoblins southeast

[1/29/2025 5:45 PM] Deciusmus
and are the key people in the coalition that defeats them

[1/29/2025 5:46 PM] rsulfuratus
FWIW this is also supposed to be on the shores of lake valandros: [https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/mace-of-terror-vision/](https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/mace-of-terror-vision/ "https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/mace-of-terror-vision/")

[1/29/2025 5:46 PM] Deciusmus
I'm not sure I like the mawar leading the fighthonestly

[1/29/2025 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
But could fit into almost any war

[1/29/2025 5:48 PM] Deciusmus
yeah me neither

[1/29/2025 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I’m not convinced Mawar leading the fight is the right vibe

[1/29/2025 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
Two thoughts: nothing has to say Mawar was great allies with the interior northern kingdoms pre Great War. So vibe is maybe less “Mawar abandonded allies” and more “Chardon and Mawar retreated and left the north to fight alone”

[1/29/2025 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
Second there is kind of a vibe of “everyone do what they need to survive” which makes Mawar again not exactly a hero but also not unusual

[1/29/2025 6:12 PM] Deciusmus
Ok here's a new idea:

[1/29/2025 6:14 PM] Deciusmus
in the early 1550s the #2 and #3 groups wipe out "Yellow Kingdoms" 2 and 3. (4 was already gone due to original cha'mutte armies)

[1/29/2025 6:14 PM] Deciusmus
basic idea: three hobgoblin strands as discussed. #1 - conquest strand. arrives by sea. exact route undetermined but they land on the north coast late 1550s +/- #2 - death and violence strand. might not be purely hobgoblins, could be orcs? something else? cause of the war which destroyed Amani #3 - conclave war strand

[1/29/2025 6:15 PM] Deciusmus
the #1 strand conqueors most of the post drankorian kingdoms, but has a frozen border with chardon (in south) and active borders with two surviving post-drankor kingdoms in blue

[1/29/2025 6:16 PM] Deciusmus
in the 1590s, something happens that wipes #2 off the map, mostly.

[1/29/2025 6:17 PM] Deciusmus
this makes the destruction up north a little less wholesale - sure "yk 2 and 3" get wiped out by some terrifying whatever but it isn't exactly like there are these endless hobgoblin wars that mawar is staying out of

[1/29/2025 6:18 PM] Deciusmus
Afk for a bit

[1/29/2025 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm home so dumping a few great library notes here

[1/29/2025 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
(1) a story told by a bard who lives alone in the mountains north of Voltara (not Chardonian) Azzan - northlander hero Ikos - Chardonian friend Fought together in the Great War against Cha'mutte, great friends. But soon after the war, in the chaos as the hobgoblins poured from the north, Chardon abandoned the Northlanders, seeking to protect their borders. Despite Ikos' pleas, Chardon did not come to their aid and many died. Now, Chardon has come back but in front of an Empire, instead of allies. (could be metaphor / retconned)

[1/29/2025 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
which reminds me, another consideration: there is a big dwarven ruins underneath the mountains separating voltara from the coast, but no dwarves

[1/29/2025 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) handouts from very early in the great library campaign, no need to be canonical

[1/29/2025 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
so these were presumably destroyed during whatever wiped out amani

[1/29/2025 6:45 PM] rsulfuratus
here is a rough outline of current west coast vibes

[1/29/2025 6:47 PM] rsulfuratus
light purple = Deno'qai

[1/29/2025 6:47 PM] rsulfuratus
red (D) = ruins of pre-Great War dwarves red (E) = ruins of pre-Great War elves pinkish = desolation / orcs / hobgoblins / whatever (no civilizations) blue = thriving non-Chardonian cultures green = "core" of Chardonian Empire, mostly quite loyal light blue = "frontier" of the Chardonian Empire. Voltara very much a garrison town with a fractious local population; lake valandros coast less clear what it is black = ?????

[1/29/2025 6:49 PM] rsulfuratus
other details: - Chardon's conquest of Voltara is not a war against a strong, organized kingdom. my headcannon has always been kind of like conquering beorinlings or something - it is entirely possible the reason why Voltara feels like a frontier is some of the light blue area is hobgoblins / empty / dangerous; or, some of the light blue area is people who don't like chardon. but it is not densely settled

[1/29/2025 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
- Yeraad really needs some thought

[1/29/2025 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
- history should provide reasons why green areas generally feel loyal and happy (this is already mostly accomplished)

[1/29/2025 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
- blue areas are not in active conflict with Chardon; to the extent Chardon has been recently expansionist it is south (to Illoria) and east (into forests / Deno'qai)

[1/29/2025 7:17 PM] Deciusmus
Right so if you take my 1560 map, it maps pretty nicely onto your "current" map

[1/29/2025 7:20 PM] Deciusmus
F is pretty closely aligned with Chardon

Basically the story goes something like.... On the eve of the Great War you have - "yellow kingdoms 1 - 5" - mawar - "post drankor kingdoms A, B, C, etc" in particular you have a bunch of related minor kingdoms (call them A, B, C, D, and E) along the coast, as well as a fairly important post-Drankorian kingdom F in the Nahadi river valley

[1/29/2025 7:21 PM] Deciusmus
(Tawir Forest and north shore of lake valandros)

[1/29/2025 7:21 PM] Deciusmus
then there are one or more scattered frontier provinces along the borders

[1/29/2025 7:22 PM] Deciusmus
When the Great War + Conclave War comes, yellow kingdoms 3 + 4 are completely wiped out.

[1/29/2025 7:23 PM] Deciusmus
as are whatever post-Drankorian realms are up the Chasa River valley (Kin-Asa, etc)

[1/29/2025 7:25 PM] Deciusmus
this "something bad" is the source of all of the vague rumors in the Great Library game, and it doesn't have to be super canonical exactly what it is

[1/29/2025 7:25 PM] Deciusmus
then "something bad" comes out of the cha'mutte army, not the conclave dragons, but something else. Could be a violent bunch of hobgoblins, could be orcs, could be a random mix of stuff. They break "yellow kingdom 2" (Amani) and whatever dwarven kingdom is in the mountains there, to the extent it has survived the great war

[1/29/2025 7:26 PM] Deciusmus
separately, the "conquest" hobgoblins land on the north coast

[1/29/2025 7:32 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the idea of a hobgobin armada conquering the north coast probably needs a bit of magical help, but the basic logic works fine

[1/29/2025 7:32 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so i think the basic idea works well

[1/29/2025 7:33 PM] rsulfuratus
^specifically because it might take too long for hobgoblins to really settle here otherwise, but maybe not

[1/29/2025 7:34 PM] rsulfuratus
the basic idea of the area stretching from north valandros coast to voltara is left relatively undeveloped but there is some bad thing here that causes destruction but is eventually defeated

[1/29/2025 7:35 PM] rsulfuratus
still some unanswered questions but this seems like a solid framework

[1/29/2025 7:35 PM] rsulfuratus
mawar renaissance in this history becomes a bit of a broader northern renaissance, basically a flourishing in the north while chardon is still bearing the brunt of the north coast hobgoblins or something (since the north is safe sooner than chardon is safe)

[1/29/2025 7:40 PM] Deciusmus
right so then in say 1560 or 1575 you have something like this:

[1/29/2025 7:41 PM] rsulfuratus
That’s consistent, south valandros is “green”

[1/29/2025 7:41 PM] Deciusmus
the blue "6" is the old post drankor F an largely survives to join chardon - i.e. after the conclave war some type of "mutual defense" alliance becomes a province or whatever. makes this "near Nahadi" a very early part of the empire like the chasa, not sure how that fits with your modern day vibes

[1/29/2025 7:42 PM] Deciusmus
and survive to modern day intact from pre-great war

[1/29/2025 7:42 PM] Deciusmus
the north two blue kingdoms (mawar and the other one) form the basis of the northern renaissance

[1/29/2025 7:42 PM] Deciusmus
the middle two blue kingdoms could in theory just get crushed by the bad things on their borders. or they could survive to form the basis of whatever chardon later conqueors during the voltara conquests. either way, not too many people here really. these are lightly populated "refugee" lands, not proper surviving kingdoms

[1/29/2025 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Ie happy to be part of the empire

[1/29/2025 7:43 PM] Deciusmus
big unknowns are: - how did so many hobgoblins appear on the coast in late 1550s - what was the big scary in the middle volatara region and what killed it (presumably it going away triggers the Mawar renaissnace/end of mawar hiding)

[1/29/2025 7:44 PM] Deciusmus
and to a lesser extent: - who were the "middle blue" kingdoms on the northwest and northeast of valandros, and what happened to them during the northern renaissance? (only real canonical fact is that they can't get wealthy and prosperous enough to be major competitors to chardon in the 1670s/80s when voltara is being conquered)

[1/29/2025 7:47 PM] rsulfuratus
right. to a certain extent none of those need to be addressed to write a "grand sweep of history on the west coast" page

[1/29/2025 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but again nothing immediately in need of addressing

[1/29/2025 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a few other minor details (who/what lives in Tawir forest?)

[1/29/2025 7:49 PM] rsulfuratus
the problem with yeraad is it is canonically quite safe during the blood years

[1/29/2025 7:49 PM] rsulfuratus
i think brainstorming yeraad is more critical to getting the final layout of the west coast done in broad strokes than filling the remaiing holes to the north

[1/29/2025 7:49 PM] Deciusmus
agreed

[1/29/2025 7:50 PM] Deciusmus
right. that whole area has to be safe enough that the pirate kings of Castrella can make a living off trade through the canal

[1/29/2025 7:50 PM] rsulfuratus
illoria is a pirate kingdom but not immediately threatened by cha'mutte related dangers or other great evils

[1/29/2025 7:50 PM] rsulfuratus
chardon never feels pressure on its southeastern borders; darba/songara is the safest part of dunmar

[1/29/2025 7:51 PM] Deciusmus
although presumably there is some disruption from the massive shocks of a huge mountain range appearing to the east?

[1/29/2025 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
illoria is barely touched by the great war, which is in part how the end up controlling darba and large parts of apporia in the immediate aftermath

[1/29/2025 7:52 PM] Deciusmus
sure

[1/29/2025 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i've never tried to square that circle. just handwave "its magic"

[1/29/2025 7:52 PM] Deciusmus
although I guess there doens't have to be - darba isn't destroyed or damaged

[1/29/2025 7:53 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly just it is safe land and presumably a pretty good climate

[1/29/2025 7:53 PM] Deciusmus
is there any reason there has to be a lot of people in yeraad? maybe its just lizardfolk

[1/29/2025 7:53 PM] rsulfuratus
there is actually an argument that the yuvanti mountains are raised by the baharzel as a refuge for the dwarves fleeing ardith

[1/29/2025 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
although under chardonian control since they happily marched many legions through there

[1/29/2025 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
yeraad in modern day is undetermined

[1/29/2025 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
i think myraeni gap and the hilly region between the elderwood and the sentinels is lightly peopled and can be left as a obvious question mark

[1/29/2025 7:54 PM] Deciusmus
what's it like in modern day?

[1/29/2025 7:54 PM] Deciusmus
and would be unlikely to be left fallow

[1/29/2025 7:54 PM] Deciusmus
right I guess safe farmland is in scare supply

[1/29/2025 7:55 PM] Deciusmus
as it implicates the whole illorian area/nevos sea/emerald coast

[1/29/2025 7:55 PM] Deciusmus
its at a somewhat complicated geographic region

[1/29/2025 7:56 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, originally this was just "core chardon empire" but that makes the core chardon empire too big in my opinion

[1/29/2025 7:56 PM] rsulfuratus
but the rest is in need of something clearer to put there

[1/29/2025 7:56 PM] rsulfuratus
in the modern day the area northeast of the chardon road is kobolds / ??? / scrubland / lightly peopled and fine to be ???

[1/29/2025 7:58 PM] rsulfuratus
in high school is was basically "core chardon"

[1/29/2025 7:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so the center of gravity of chardon shifted north

[1/29/2025 7:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but the swamps and rivers got moved around and this area got stretched in the current map

[1/29/2025 8:01 PM] Deciusmus
so on the map there are a lot of cities and roads here

[1/29/2025 8:01 PM] Deciusmus
right

[1/29/2025 8:02 PM] rsulfuratus
there are really 2 cities. i'd consider anything northwest of the "south chardon hills" to be "core chardon/chasa" not yeraad

[1/29/2025 8:02 PM] Deciusmus
but also it feels a bit separated from the coast

[1/29/2025 8:03 PM] Deciusmus
but not sure if that is right

[1/29/2025 8:03 PM] Deciusmus
so from the map I'd guess the denset population is the yellow:

[1/29/2025 8:03 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess 3 cities - one is in the hills

[1/29/2025 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure how far it extends so maybe some settlement around the mountains on the coast

[1/29/2025 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i think that is close. the coast is imaged to be swampy with a big delta

[1/29/2025 8:05 PM] Deciusmus
I think it is useful for the yeraad to be culturally pretty disconnected from the nevos

[1/29/2025 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but you definitely have people on the north slopes

[1/29/2025 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case for whatever reason those mountains are supposed to be pretty uninhabited

[1/29/2025 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
most of the mountains are imagined to closely approach the ocean so you get cliffs and not a lot of settlement. and also maybe giants or something that keep people from venturing too much

[1/29/2025 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
the mouth of the yeraad i've always imagined kind of like the mississipi delta

[1/29/2025 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yes

[1/29/2025 8:07 PM] Deciusmus
but you could imagine it as pretty heavily populated with lizardfolk

[1/29/2025 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the interior is maybe a bit like texas hill country

[1/29/2025 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
but not too different

[1/29/2025 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
and somewhat drier overall

[1/29/2025 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
it's about 3 degrees further north

[1/29/2025 8:07 PM] Deciusmus
right

[1/29/2025 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
if anyone lives between delta and mountains it is probably small illorian colonies, that type of thing. and the area with the windmill on the map is basically "core chardon", if undeveloped in detail

[1/29/2025 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
and this feels like it should have a pretty different culture / vibe than core chardon

[1/29/2025 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is really the interior area south of river, north of moutains, along the road connecting the two major cities that needs development

[1/29/2025 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
the one city is kind of placed as a mining town, although chardon mostly gets metals from lake valanadros hills, which are closer and have river transport

[1/29/2025 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
but what is not clear, nor is how they came to be chardonian

[1/29/2025 8:12 PM] Deciusmus
green is "yeraad river"

[1/29/2025 8:12 PM] Deciusmus
yellow is core chardon

[1/29/2025 8:12 PM] Deciusmus
blue is lizardfolk

[1/29/2025 8:12 PM] Deciusmus
red is danger/no people

[1/29/2025 8:12 PM] Deciusmus
where pink is illorian

[1/29/2025 8:12 PM] Deciusmus
so you have something like this:

[1/29/2025 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. maybe curving up a bit between the major swamps on the yeraad, but the basic outline is correct

[1/29/2025 8:15 PM] Deciusmus
in the ?? period it would have been largely on the drankorian borderlands for a fairly long time

[1/29/2025 8:15 PM] Deciusmus
So from a historical perspective, this would have been ?? -> drankorian -> some kind of post-drankor state -> relatively safe in great war / blood years -> somehow part of chardon

[1/29/2025 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
but darba was a bigger border and songara wasn't founded

[1/29/2025 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
right. at one point i had the idea that somewhat whatever was here actually triggered the western wars somehow. e.g. maybe got taken over by something evil or ???

[1/29/2025 8:16 PM] Deciusmus
although perhaps not meaningfully so if the songra area was unpeopled and drankor was focused on the nevos sea/darba

[1/29/2025 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
so there would be contact but maybe not a lot of contact

[1/29/2025 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
the myraeni gap is a natural barrier

[1/29/2025 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
so maybe not a super dense or high traffic border

[1/29/2025 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
right. its also fairly big (300 miles by 200 miles, roughly) and doesn't need to be just one thing

[1/29/2025 8:20 PM] Deciusmus
It feels like a good place for a kinda insular culture. Happy to have a sovereign overlord but kinda do their own thing

[1/29/2025 8:21 PM] Deciusmus
Right

[1/29/2025 8:22 PM] Deciusmus
What’s the climate like?

[1/29/2025 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but the rest of the valley is probably not quite that dry

[1/29/2025 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
the myraeni gap is very much texas hill country

[1/29/2025 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
i could see the wedge between the two eastern tributaries as being pretty much texas hill country

[1/29/2025 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the northeast part along the elderwood is clearly wetter and is maybe the most densely populated

[1/29/2025 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
Chardon is supposed to have a kind of san francisco climate vibe

[1/29/2025 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
the whole area is marked Csa

[1/29/2025 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
spain and greece and parts of italy also work

[1/29/2025 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
but warm enough for year round growing - basically california

[1/29/2025 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
the summer high pressure shifts over the yeraad to allows the monsoons, so this is definitely a dry summer, wet winter area

[1/29/2025 8:30 PM] Deciusmus
Right. But with slightly different mountain structure.

[1/29/2025 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
Right running perpendicular instead of parallel to coast

[1/29/2025 8:32 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah I was kinda thinking the same

[1/29/2025 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
I’m kind of thinking the right vibe might actually several small fragmented cultures without much cultural or political cohesion

[1/29/2025 8:34 PM] Deciusmus
If you play with the geographic a little bit you could have 3-4 pretty separate regions, ie maybe the land between the two rivers is kinda higher and you have a cattle culture in the hill lands between the rivers

[1/29/2025 8:35 PM] Deciusmus
Then the section north of the yeraad along south of the hills is wetter and more agricultural

[1/29/2025 8:37 PM] rsulfuratus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/rsulfuratus/757_1_1_image.png.fQRqoaqsCZ.png)

[1/29/2025 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
with 1 and northern part of 2 densest settlement

[1/29/2025 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but the exact borders could shift a bit

[1/29/2025 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
something like: (1) agricultural, maybe olive growing (2) dry rocky hills, cattle ranching (3) ?? - highlands? not sure, imaging the eastern river here is rapid and non-navigable (4) river valley culture

[1/29/2025 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
alternatively 3 could be perfectly logical place for non-humans

[1/29/2025 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
although who is not clear

[1/29/2025 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
i think: (2) is dusty roads, and only nominally controlled by chardon. basically, they staff forts along the roads. maybe charge tribute in the form of some kind of tax. but culturally this really isn't chardonian

[1/29/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure

[1/29/2025 8:43 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah I like that. Maybe the tax is more of a “protection” thing as well, ie the northern borders are not that safe

[1/29/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
although probably worshipping mos numena

[1/29/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
this could be "myraeni" / a more pure "original northerner" culture

[1/29/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
and culturally may be distinct from 1/3/4 too

[1/29/2025 8:44 PM] Deciusmus
So kinda a happy to pay situation because Chardons a pretty competent overlord and is not that interested in forcing local politics to change

[1/29/2025 8:45 PM] Deciusmus
Not really questioned or a problem. Maybe lots of poorer folks here join the army even

[1/29/2025 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
right. canonically there was a lot of trouble with kobold raiders here

[1/29/2025 8:45 PM] Deciusmus
So the legions and such are pretty welcomed ie when they are marching to Dunmar

[1/29/2025 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and actually the vibe was always "chardon doesn't pay enough attention to our problems"

[1/29/2025 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i think (1) is likely fairly well integrated into chardon. this maybe has a similar story to Raziolo, the further west province in apporia

[1/29/2025 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
but culturally maybe distinct from (2). perhaps more drankorian, perhaps more culturally chardonian. maybe a substantial population of refugees from chasa river from conclave war who fled and never returned (Kin-Aska was completely destroyed, for example)

[1/29/2025 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
the conclave armies got within ~50 miles of chardon

[1/29/2025 8:50 PM] Deciusmus
Wouldn’t refugees just flee toward Chardon?

[1/29/2025 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
probably don't need much detail here, although eventually want names and more history, for the broad sweep post-Great War these are integrated peacefully during the period of consolidation and expansion between 1600 - 1640 roughly

[1/29/2025 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
(1) is both ~75 miles closer to Kin-Aska and crucially south of the path of the invading army, which is clearly heading to chardon

[1/29/2025 8:52 PM] Deciusmus
Right

[1/29/2025 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but the details don't really matter

[1/29/2025 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
well, i would say (1) and (2) on my map, yes. (3) and (4) maybe not

[1/29/2025 8:55 PM] Deciusmus
Either way the main idea would be that yeraad is a somewhat culturally unique area largely supportive of Chardonian rule but not really Chardonian culturally

[1/29/2025 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
although would have to have problems for some reason or it wouldn't be worthwhile to go all the way north to voltara

[1/29/2025 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i kind of wonder if there is another chalyte source in the south mountains and that is the purpose of the city in (3)

[1/29/2025 8:57 PM] Deciusmus
Who don’t really want Chardon to take the chaylte

[1/29/2025 8:57 PM] Deciusmus
What if there are giants

[1/29/2025 8:59 PM] Deciusmus
Right.

[1/29/2025 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that could work. i'm not totally ready to commit to a specific idea especially involving chalyte as this may be quite relevant to the coming chardonian upheavals

[1/29/2025 9:00 PM] Deciusmus
Right. Doesn’t even have to be chaylte

[1/29/2025 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
this area probably was conquered during the later expansionist phase for ~reasons~

[1/29/2025 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think the basic vibe of (3) being "something that is complicated by some complicated factor potentially involving giants or something" is sensible

[1/29/2025 9:01 PM] Deciusmus
Say, no one really knows what happened to the people.

[1/29/2025 9:01 PM] Deciusmus
Could also be an area that was mysteriously empty after the Great War.

[1/29/2025 9:02 PM] Deciusmus
The details don’t really matter

[1/29/2025 9:02 PM] Deciusmus
I dunno. The vibes work

[1/29/2025 9:03 PM] rsulfuratus
Right

[1/29/2025 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
Then maybe 4 is just lightly populated? I’m not sure the (4) vibes

[1/29/2025 9:05 PM] Deciusmus
I think the lizardfolk have something to do with (4) vibes

[1/29/2025 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe that region is not even part of the chardonian empire

[1/29/2025 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah that seems right

[1/29/2025 9:10 PM] Deciusmus
Interesting

[1/29/2025 9:10 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah actually that’s intent

[1/29/2025 9:11 PM] Deciusmus
(3) doesn’t go well for ~reasons~ so it becomes kind of a lightly settled borderland, but plenty of people moved there or whatever so it isn’t empty

[1/29/2025 9:11 PM] Deciusmus
(3) has not a lot of people but something Chardon wants. Which motivates the peaceful absorption of (1) and (2) and least in part

[1/29/2025 9:12 PM] Deciusmus
But (1) and especially (2) are the places with long interesting histories

[1/29/2025 9:15 PM] Deciusmus
Then there is something in 4, in between the red danger separating it from the coast and the oddities of (3), but it’s intentionally blank for now. But not part of Chardon and maybe not even drankoiran

[1/29/2025 9:19 PM] Deciusmus
Right

[1/29/2025 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
(4) might have an interesting history, just an insular one

[1/29/2025 9:36 PM] Deciusmus
Ok I’m going to try to write up some of the non-yeraad stuff over tomorrow/Friday/Saturday

[1/29/2025 9:38 PM] Deciusmus
Basic canonical points: - hobgoblins by sea to north Chardon - “bad thing” central attack on voltara - conclave war - end of bad thing is start of Mawar renaissance Non-canonical: - what the bad thing was and how it ended - what happened to the hobgoblins on north Chardon as they were defeated

[1/29/2025 9:39 PM] Deciusmus
Canonical: - some kind of south valandros kingdom that is absorbed into Chardon - north east and north west valandros lightly populated - non drankorian realm on north bay coast Non canocial: - any details of the middle and north places (might make up some details on the place that is now part of Chardon heartland)

[1/29/2025 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
[]

[1/29/2025 9:42 PM] Deciusmus
Sure

[1/29/2025 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, sounds reasonable. i may have some more comments / thoughts when it is all written out but am trying to finish the cosmology project asap so i can push a new taelgarverse saturday, and need to switch to session prep, so might not have time to do much more of this for a bit

[1/29/2025 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but generally speaking should be without good reason to deviate

[1/29/2025 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i pushed my chasa river valley notes from onenote to brainstorming. mostly you didn't spend any time in cities so much of this kind of passed in a blur in the background and doesn't need to be strictly canonical

[1/29/2025 10:08 PM] Deciusmus
A couple of name ideas Veneros Tarquina Valandria (intentionally similar to Valandros) Nemora (or Nemoris) Vescarum Marcenium Oscandria Yeraetium

[1/29/2025 10:09 PM] Deciusmus
Neracium

[1/29/2025 10:09 PM] Deciusmus
Vastarno

[1/29/2025 10:10 PM] Deciusmus
Lupentia

[1/29/2025 10:15 PM] Deciusmus
If you get a chance to flag any you particularly like/don’t let me know. I’ll tag everything name check anyway

[1/29/2025 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I forget what I used for kin-aska, I may have been thinking kind of Deno’qai northern

[1/29/2025 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus
These are towns/cities? I haven’t settled on solid naming conventions around Chardon. I think generally “Roman-ish” is fine although I’ve often trended more Italian in places (eg apporia). Lots of places in the north would potentially be akin to latinized Arabic or other Semitic names

[1/29/2025 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus
Rivers have tended to be Semitic / Northros, but not always

[1/29/2025 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
Volganis and Amani are based on high school names so no linguistic derivation

[1/29/2025 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
Voltara area naming is a mess and mostly not canonical but tends Italian which I’m not sure is correct

[1/29/2025 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
Lupentia is good too

[1/29/2025 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
That said, I like Nemoris, Tarquina, Oscandria. Could be lots of Valandros-related names, plausibly, but generallly for old drankorian things

[1/29/2025 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus
Don’t really like Veneros

[1/29/2025 10:28 PM] Deciusmus
Possibly for sites of battles or whatever

[1/29/2025 10:28 PM] Deciusmus
These are mostly for provinces or other regions. Probably not rivers

[1/29/2025 10:29 PM] Deciusmus
Primarily post-Drankorian not up north stuff

[1/29/2025 10:34 PM] Deciusmus
What about Mizranis Rafida Darajum Kasira Badirum Qamira Wassid or Wassidi As river names?

[1/29/2025 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I like Rafida and Qamira, which I would probably “chardonize” to Kamir or something

[1/29/2025 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there is also nothing wrong with a few “Green River” or “Rushing River” type names

[1/29/2025 10:41 PM] Deciusmus
Not sure I like any of them

[1/29/2025 10:41 PM] Deciusmus
For the north coast region in general… Lirae Verdinum Litus Aureum Caledria Arabic/northros Bahrica Yasir Rimila

[1/29/2025 10:42 PM] Deciusmus
Anyway going to bed

[1/29/2025 10:42 PM] Deciusmus
Alternatively something like The Green Coast The Fertile Coast The Gold Coast

[1/30/2025 6:37 PM] Deciusmus
No, I was busy all day at work and then tonight is Zachary’s winter concert

[1/30/2025 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm nearly done with cosmology - just have two pages left to do and then some headers and organization - i'm not sure if i'll have energy or inclination to do any other worldbuilding tonight but in case i do did you start anything on the west coast history stuff?

[1/30/2025 6:38 PM] Deciusmus
But probably won’t do anything else tonight although maybe a bit when I get home

[1/30/2025 6:38 PM] Deciusmus
I pushed a few minor cleanups that were pending

[1/30/2025 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
secondary location has all sorts of nice uses:

[1/30/2025 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
if you feel like naming things these are the backlinks to pages in Cosmology that need names:

[1/30/2025 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
cosmology is done. pushed the last update. pretty happy with how it turned out. might do a little more reorganizing of staging files and filling in a few details at some point. also happy for any feedback if you have suggestions anywhere. didn't tag anything as check/mike particularly but: - pandemonium - the entire planar concepts directory - spiritual realms, divine realms, and energy realms landing pages - heart of the mountain are probably most relevant to look over

[1/30/2025 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yes

[1/30/2025 9:04 PM] Deciusmus
I guess you did

[1/30/2025 9:04 PM] Deciusmus
did you fix all the names?

[1/30/2025 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
didn't spend a ton of time on them

[1/30/2025 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but probably worth skimming the cosmology landing page and seeing if anything jumps out as a weak name in the "Staging" section

[1/30/2025 9:06 PM] Deciusmus
I think there are a lot of advantages of the in world writing style as it makes it easier to defer difficult "what is true" decisions and still make things feel "done"

[1/30/2025 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i made the same landing page for background. it is pretty easy to copy over. haven't found a way to use variables in dataview queries but it only takes a minute to manually update

[1/30/2025 9:06 PM] Deciusmus
its a really nice organization

[1/30/2025 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
it definitely takes a lot more time. but glad it came out well

[1/30/2025 9:28 PM] Deciusmus
I like the pandemonium page

[1/30/2025 9:38 PM] Deciusmus
just fixing a few typos and stuff; one thought... is it worth getting rid of settled open questions? for example I think you've pretty much settled the whole idea of "what are the incorporeal gods divine realms" by making them inaccessible to adventures/PCs and thus unimportant to decide

[1/30/2025 9:39 PM] Deciusmus
is the dicssion in open questions worth keeping?

[1/30/2025 9:39 PM] Deciusmus
with the caveat that in theory, that might only be true for Mos Numena but we don't have to decide given no other substantial religions exist whos secrets would be known by anyone

[1/30/2025 9:58 PM] rsulfuratus
probably yes - i didn't really have the energy to go through and delete what feels settled but i think it is ifne to do. anything that feels like useful brainstorming can be copied to the discussions/brainstorming instead of deleted outright, but we always have it in the git history if needed

[1/31/2025 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
will try to push regularly in case you are doing any taelgar stuff today

[1/31/2025 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
to the extent to which i have time today (might be a lot - very few meetings so unless i get a bunch of email to deal with a pretty light day), i'm working on fleshing out some backgorund notes, primarily two new notes i moved from brainstorming: - hobgoblin movements after cha'mutte - west coast history framework not really starting on a full fledged "Timeline of the West Coast" publishable note yet but instead trying to organize canonical facts vs ideas from long discussion

[1/31/2025 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
fyi i have a copy of the map where the region boundaries layer is not mesed up with the west coast history lines. can restore to that if it is too much of a hassle to carefullly erase the west coast stuff from the region boundaries

[1/31/2025 1:39 PM] Deciusmus
I fixed it

[1/31/2025 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Should just lock the region borders layer so you cant accidentally draw on it

[1/31/2025 1:51 PM] Deciusmus
are you actively working on anything? I have about 20 minutes and I was thinking of trying to write a bit more of the hobgoblin movements

[1/31/2025 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
No should have pushed everything

[1/31/2025 4:20 PM] Deciusmus
and my WIP Greater Chardon gazetteer main page

[1/31/2025 4:20 PM] Deciusmus
I pushed a few small updates to the hobgoblin movements page

[1/31/2025 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
can use clean up but should be roughly complete, pending some open questions (which could be better highlighted)

[1/31/2025 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a draft of the west coast history framework note

[1/31/2025 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
mawar emerges with the defeat of "central evil realm"

[1/31/2025 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at your questions. i think the mawar renaissance works quite well if you think about the Chardonian conquest north as a ~80 year process from 1600-1680 that involved a ton of resources and manpower

[1/31/2025 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
possibly they help in some ways - maybe there is a joint mawar/chardon naval battle that destroys the hobgoblin navy at one point

[1/31/2025 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
so mawar controls the seas and trade more or less

[1/31/2025 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
chardon is spending all its energy slowly conquering north

[1/31/2025 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
basically chardon is spain here, which doesn't emerge as a major mercantile power till after the reconquista

[1/31/2025 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean the reconquista was like 700 years wasn't it?

[1/31/2025 4:51 PM] Deciusmus
right, I guess I'm not totally sure why it takes ~2-3 generations to drive out the hobgoblins. But I guess plenty of medieval warfare is slow with lots of stalemates and slow advances and consolidation of gains and whatnot

[1/31/2025 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
more like the 100 years war than the reconquista

[1/31/2025 5:00 PM] Deciusmus
and just as many alliances between a little christian kingdom and a muslim one has christian vs muslim

[1/31/2025 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
so you have a bunch of fits and starts and shifting terrain

[1/31/2025 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
partly i'm envisioning that this is not one great hobgoblin kingdom fielding a single massive army for a decivise battle against Chardon. it is maybe 10 smaller hobgoblin kingdoms, in a shifting series of alliances

[1/31/2025 5:00 PM] Deciusmus
yeah although a lot of fits and starts

[1/31/2025 5:01 PM] Deciusmus
against another?

[1/31/2025 5:01 PM] Deciusmus
are the chardonians sometimes allying with one group?

[1/31/2025 5:01 PM] Deciusmus
I guess I'm trying to figure out the vibe of a slow reconquest against hobgoblins, i.e. how "evil" are they?

[1/31/2025 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
it is more like, you have a victory but you just don't have the people to fight again

[1/31/2025 5:02 PM] Deciusmus
I'm not against it I just think it is worth considering the impact on psyche/history/etc of a long drawn out push of the hobgoblins out of the terriority

[1/31/2025 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure i like that exactly. but chardon at this point is a new empire and the entire area has seen a generation of war and a lot of death

[1/31/2025 5:03 PM] Deciusmus
I mean, the rivers are well structured for a sequence of stalemates along these rivers

[1/31/2025 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is the second

[1/31/2025 5:03 PM] Deciusmus
Like, more specifically, what makes it take a long time? Does it feel like endless war? Is it more like hobgoblin kingdom X falls but the cost is high and there is a new fortified border, and 10 years of frozen conflict

[1/31/2025 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
so there is a lot of fits and starts as chardon works to forge disjointed territory into a functional empire

[1/31/2025 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
the shadow armanda is a naval victory and chardon's first kind of "return to power" is as a maritime power

[1/31/2025 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
chardon was not a major military power in the great war. they win against the dragons, but basically only because of the elves and some high level magic. possibly the conclave war leaves chardon dangerously exposed as many high level magic users die

[1/31/2025 5:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i imagine that the 50-80 years of war against hobgoblins is when the now-famous chardonian legion and chardonian battle mages are forged and more-or-less invented / rediscovered

[1/31/2025 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
this would also be the first offensive war chardon fights basically ever; other wars are desperate defenses that end with a skin-of-the-teeth victoy (conclave) or a dramatic victory (shadow)

[1/31/2025 5:09 PM] Deciusmus
and then in the 1640s the cycle repeats, with victories and then losses, but it is better nd faster

[1/31/2025 5:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the pysche of chardon is very much that the 1560-1600 period is kind of a freak out. this is when the society of the open scroll is founded, for example (1561)

[1/31/2025 5:09 PM] Deciusmus
right. so it is more like... 1550s there is a fragile stalemate/peace and chardon is just thankful the hobgoblins don't move farther south because they are not sure they'd survive then you get some leader or movement in say 1608 that launches somekind of push, and maybe it succeeds fora bit but then fails and chardon falls back to the old fortified river line. and then in 1618 sometime tries again and this time there is a major victory, and some hobgoblin leader is killed, but it takes 5 more years of scrambling to stabilize the newly reclaimed terrority, and then the next kingdom almost overruns them, and so it takes 15 years before anyone tries again

[1/31/2025 5:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right. i think the will is there and i think after the defeat of the shadow armanda there is a lot of popular sentiment in chardon that it is a grave moral failing to leave the people of the north coast suffering under hobgoblin rule (which, although gentle for hobgoblins, is not great)

[1/31/2025 5:10 PM] Deciusmus
and then it repeats again only 10 years later, and this time chardon does better, etc

[1/31/2025 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
the only question then is why don't they get involved in the mindknife war? or if they do, why does mawar suffer so much?

[1/31/2025 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
but it takes time for chardon to grow into the ability to win quickly and easily. by the 1670s they probably sweep up the last of the hobgoblins without much trouble

[1/31/2025 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
it kind of makes me think the mindkinfe war should be something pretty weird, like aberrations emerging from the middle of the peninsula or something

[1/31/2025 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
and really should probably not last 10 years, it should be a quick devasting war that crushes mawar before they can really even call for help. maybe chardon does help / send aid in the end but the damage is done

[1/31/2025 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
push it a bit later, so chardon is in its last expansionist phase, and then you have the combination of mawar being wary of invinting the chardonians in as well

[1/31/2025 5:16 PM] Deciusmus
Right like 1682-1685

[1/31/2025 5:16 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah I’ve always envisioned it as coming from either the north or the peninsula itself

[1/31/2025 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah

[2/1/2025 10:21 AM] Deciusmus
Have you thought at all about how many stoneborn there are and where they might live?

[2/1/2025 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
not in depth. there are a lot living in the southern sentinels, and a decent number in apporia

[2/1/2025 10:23 AM] Deciusmus
I was going through region main pages trying to at least fill in notes on civilizations in each region

[2/1/2025 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
but otherwise have not given it much thought. no one (besides nathaniel and zachary in aborted / non-canon games) has played a stoneborn as more than a guest character

[2/1/2025 10:24 AM] Deciusmus
Right.

[2/1/2025 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. they can grow food in high mountains and don't feel the cold, etc

[2/1/2025 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
the lore of stoneborn has always been that they can live in places others can't because ~magic~

[2/1/2025 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
kate's guest character in the delwath solo was from a stoneborn community in the northern sentinels near the northern denoqai but whether that was a big community or just a few stoneborn living with deno'qai is unclear

[2/1/2025 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
at one point i invented a desert stoneborn variant (sandborn), in part for one of the early players in the great library campaign who dropped out about half way through

[2/1/2025 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
(but could be)

[2/1/2025 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
but it was never developed and isn't canonical

[2/1/2025 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
oh, there were a lot of stoneborn living in the svarnjo mountains too

[2/1/2025 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't want to make too many constraining decisions about stoneborn though because at some point someone will want to play one for a long campaign and it would be nice to leave space for player input

[2/1/2025 10:29 AM] Deciusmus
I agree but also I think it is good to know where the gaps are

[2/1/2025 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't think the region pages need to be considered complete - i think it is better to just catalog what has been invented and not feel obligated to make up a bunch of stuff just to fill gaps

[2/1/2025 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
sure

[2/1/2025 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
right

[2/1/2025 10:30 AM] Deciusmus
That is, say, there is clearly not a major stoneborn community in say the mostreve hills

[2/1/2025 10:31 AM] Deciusmus
And to some extent it is better to decide something like… hrm there are too few stoneborn communities in the “core” known world and add one (even if poorly defined) then to have a bunch of other invention proceed without the stoneborn somewhere and then get kinda stuck with trying to decide why the stoneborn somewhere didn’t have any influence on history or culture

[2/1/2025 10:32 AM] Deciusmus
(For stoneborn specifically I don’t think it matters actually as they are kinda canonically on the edges of events)

[2/1/2025 10:33 AM] Deciusmus
But lizardfolk and dwarves actually seem somewhat lightly represented across the known world as well.

[2/1/2025 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus
but yeah i agree with the general idea

[2/1/2025 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus
right i was going to say i actually like stoneborn as not have a big impact on world events

[2/1/2025 10:34 AM] Deciusmus
Although perhaps lizardfolk should be thought of more like halflings and not usually or only found in “lizardfolk realms”

[2/1/2025 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
going through the hobgoblin movements does make it seem like it would be worth going through the non-humans and thinking a bit about where they canonically exist and have influence, where the open spaces are, and whether any of them should be "reserved"

[2/1/2025 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
dwarves feel pretty complete, actually: - huge significant kingdoms across the sentinels - additional important and influential kingdom in yuvanti - chardon has a significant dwarven population - apporia did have lots of dwarves but they were mostly killed in the war of the dark rift, and the ones that survived are, in part, now scattered across the core of the chardonian empire - additional dwarves in the svarnjo mountains mostly living in the giant kingdoms

[2/1/2025 10:39 AM] Deciusmus
where do the chardon dwarves come from?

[2/1/2025 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
- plus the destroyed dwarven kingdom west of amani that can have had significant cultural impact in the north but is now part of the destroyed legacy of the pre-great-war kingdoms

[2/1/2025 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
right, although that doesn't have to be all there is, that is the vibe i invented for ulfgar frostbeard

[2/1/2025 10:40 AM] Deciusmus
right, so basically relatively recent immigrates coming from "destroyed" places

[2/1/2025 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
apporia, ardith, amani mostly

[2/1/2025 10:41 AM] Deciusmus
I've been running sembara as the kind of place where dwarves have been slowly drifting into human communities from the sentinel kingdoms for 500ish years or perhaps more, long enough that some places have long established dwarven enclaves, but where also the numbers are always quite small comparatively, and generally with the feel of "expats" rather than natives

[2/1/2025 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus
canonically mawar has very few dwarves and the mawakel border mountains never hosted a significant dwarven population, but other than that they are basically everywhere

[2/1/2025 10:42 AM] Deciusmus
(quite small comparatively means not necessarily absolutely small numbers, but the dwarves are always outnumbered by halflings and humans)

[2/1/2025 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
right, i think that is correct and the vibe of dwarves is that, while they didn't suffer as much as the elves in the great war + aftermath, the biggest, most powerful dwarven kingdom was obliterated by a huge disaster

[2/1/2025 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
actually possible it is relatively more dwarven

[2/1/2025 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
cymea is undecided

[2/1/2025 10:44 AM] Deciusmus
Is Cymea relatively less dwarven?

[2/1/2025 10:45 AM] Deciusmus
I guess there this question of whether the vibe should - oh there is a substantial mountain range, there are probably dwarves there but maybe not or - most dwarves live in the sentinels or kingdoms that spun off from the sentinels

[2/1/2025 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
also for example the sembaran highlands might be much more dwarven than the lowlands

[2/1/2025 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. longstanding dwarven connections and far enough away from the diaster of the sentinels to be less impacted

[2/1/2025 10:46 AM] Deciusmus
I think the zimka in general have always had a close relationship with the sentinel dwarven kingdoms

[2/1/2025 10:46 AM] Deciusmus
The highland kingdoms in particular are quite dwarven, in my view.

[2/1/2025 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm

[2/1/2025 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
ah i see

[2/1/2025 10:49 AM] Deciusmus
its just, "is it unusual that there are not dwarves in the mostreve hills"

[2/1/2025 10:49 AM] Deciusmus
Right, the question isn't "are there far flung dwarves"

[2/1/2025 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
i think for dwarves the history is not exactly clear. the gnomes left early on when the - at that time - primarily sentinel-based major dwarven empires started a big underdark campaign against far realm evils the downfall doesn't destroy the sentinels in the way it dries up the lizardfolk swamps and destroys the elven empires so maybe after the downfall there is a big expansion of dwarven realms, so you get some pretty far flung kingdoms. but i'm not sure it is decided and i'm not sure it needs to be?

[2/1/2025 10:50 AM] Deciusmus
but I don't know if that has to be right

[2/1/2025 10:50 AM] Deciusmus
I dunno? I guess my view is that from the perspective of Sembara, the sentinels are where the "big underground" dwarven realms are, and everything else is pretty much "living with humans"

[2/1/2025 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
probably a little unusual?

[2/1/2025 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
so maybe there were dwarves in the mostreve hills a long time ago

[2/1/2025 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
potentially pre-Downfall and not explored since then

[2/1/2025 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
there is actually what might be a piece of a dwarven long road deep beneath a cave in addermarch

[2/1/2025 10:54 AM] Deciusmus
Elves don’t have a great place on the map for a second refugee

[2/1/2025 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
as stoneborn canonically are at the edges of things anyway

[2/1/2025 10:54 AM] Deciusmus
Yeah that’s fair

[2/1/2025 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
lizardfolk imo likely need the most thought to make sure they are appopriately represented

[2/1/2025 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
in general though i feel like dwarves are pretty well though out (as are halflings and elves for the most part, although elves could probably use a second canonical refuge so you have more options for where an elf comes from then orenlas or the ruins of ainumarya)

[2/1/2025 10:55 AM] Deciusmus
Yeah I agree

[2/1/2025 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
tawir forest could work

[2/1/2025 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't think the elderwood works really well given the adventure there

[2/1/2025 10:55 AM] Deciusmus
Or far east/south

[2/1/2025 10:55 AM] Deciusmus
Or somewhere pretty marginal

[2/1/2025 10:55 AM] Deciusmus
Unless it’s in the elder wood somewhere

[2/1/2025 10:56 AM] Deciusmus
Tawir Forest could but it changes the hobgoblin narrative a bit - are the elves helping? Staying isolated?

[2/1/2025 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
(i mean i think dreamhaven is also canonically something of an elven refuge)

[2/1/2025 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
i was actually imagining it as a new elven realm, basically settled in the 1620s or something (would need to check the generation timing) by survivors of the conclave war who didn't flee to the feywild / turn their backs on humans / etc

[2/1/2025 10:58 AM] Deciusmus
Right. That commits to a certain “what happened to the survivors of Ainumayria” at least in part but that might be ok

[2/1/2025 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus
apporia also works but generally only for isolationist elves

[2/1/2025 10:59 AM] Deciusmus
I was thinking something in apporia could work - maybe the southern/illoria coast

[2/1/2025 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe actually elves are fine

[2/1/2025 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm. yeah. maybe better to leave the survivors of ainumayria open-ended

[2/1/2025 11:00 AM] Deciusmus
Doesn’t have to be isolationist, they could be a longstanding group of elves with a bit of a sailing vibe.

[2/1/2025 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
right, if far enough south they could have just been outside the sphere of the major canonical events

[2/1/2025 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
that is an intentional blank spot anyway so don't think it is worth putting anything there right way but can keep in mind

[2/1/2025 11:24 AM] Deciusmus
here is my map for dwarves and elves blue - elves (X = destroyed) (but the second elven kingdom is just an idea) pink - dwarves (X = destroyed, arrows = significant movement, dotted areas are places where it might actually matter for worldbuilding whether there are significant dwarven realms)

[2/1/2025 11:27 AM] Deciusmus
I put the elves down in apporia because the more I think about it, the more it feels like there really should be another elven place that isn't orenlas, the vibe of orenlas was never really "the last elven home"

[2/1/2025 11:29 AM] Deciusmus
and I think it is better to have something in the nevos sea than to commit to survivors of ainumayra in tawir; I like the basic vibe of Ainumayra being "even the other elves don't really know what happened, this was a big disaster, most of the elves died, sure there were some refugees and whatnot that escaped, but ultimately most of the elves were not active participants in taelgar events after the conclave war"

[2/1/2025 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i know you're at the show now, but i think my perspective is - sure this is interesting brainstorming but i am very reluctant to commit to anything at the moment. right now the currently running games are all focused on southern sembara and environs, or high level adventures in other planes apporia, vostok, and cymea are are interesting areas that are ripe for adventures. i don't want to overcommit to worldbuliding in advance of running a game. my feeling is i'm far enough behind on updating the vault to reflect (a) things that are canonical in game but haven't been clearly recorded, and (b) fleshing out details and making consistent/organizing of things that exist in broad strokes, that delving into quite tangential questions like "where else might elves live" is a bit distracting

[2/1/2025 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i think there are advantages of fleshing out details of history where the broad stroke are canonical, because it makes it easier to avoid accidently introducing continuity errors and it makes game prep faster

[2/1/2025 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
apporia and illoria is supposed to be a blank spot, so there shouldn't be an elven population there unless it becomes useful for a game

[2/1/2025 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
but i like the perspective of focusing on cataloging blank spots, not filling them

[2/1/2025 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, that's my overall feeling at the moment

[2/1/2025 6:25 PM] Deciusmus
that's fair

[2/2/2025 10:49 AM] Deciusmus
So I'm struggling with trying to come up with a tone for Gazetteer landing pages that I like. This is part of why I've been going in circles on defining stuff, because it is easier to hit the right tone with "well defined" or "totally rumors" than with "sorta defined". But here are two attempts (using "Civ and Culture for the Western Green Sea") one more "in-world", one more "player"

[2/2/2025 10:50 AM] Deciusmus
### **Style 2: "Player" Perspective** > Written for players, clearly stating what is known, unknown, and undeveloped. The region of Cymea and its surroundings is primarily home to humans, but other species are present in various ways. - **Elves**: They are rare in this region. Most elves originate from Orenlas, but there’s an idea that some elves from Rostare may have resettled here. This has not been fully defined yet. - **Dwarves**: There are probably significant dwarven populations around [[~South Cymea~]], but dwarves are rare in Cymea and practically nonexistent in the Skaer Islands. - **Lizardfolk**: The Latazso swamp on the western border is a major lizardfolk homeland, so logically, there are some lizardfolk in Cymea and further south. However, the specifics of lizardfolk in southern Cymea haven’t been determined yet. - **Humans**: Three major human cultures exist in this region: - the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], who mostly settle on the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]], but are common sights as mariners across the region. - [[Cymea]], a Drankorian province that had a significant maritime empire sometime before the [[Great War]] but is now in decline. This is a land of city-states and coastal towns without major political cohesion - [[~South Cymea~]], a poorly defined Drankorian province (or perhaps multiple provinces) that suffered greatly during the [[Great War]] and [[Blood Years]]. Some type of polity has emerged, but its exact shape is unclear, although its influence on [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], [[Tollen]], and [[Tyrwingha]] is minimal - **Stoneborn**: There’s no indication of a significant Stoneborn population here. - **Dangerous Wilderness**: This region is relatively settled, and most "dangerous wilderness" elements will probably be placed in **Drankorian Hinterland** or **Upper Istaros** instead.

[2/2/2025 10:50 AM] Deciusmus
Lizardfolk are known to dwell in great numbers within the Latazso swamp on the western border. It is believed that many venture into Cymea and beyond, though their purpose and settlements, if any, remain unclear. Some say that the southern reaches of Cymea hold hidden lizardfolk enclaves, but no one can confirm this with certainty. The Stoneborn, if they have ever held a place in this land, have left no lasting mark. No known settlements of their kind exist here. As for true wilderness, the land is largely tamed, at least compared to the savage expanses of the **Drankorian Hinterland** or the **Upper Istaros**. While dangers certainly exist, the deep, untamed wilds seem to lie beyond these borders.

[2/2/2025 10:50 AM] Deciusmus
### **Style 1: "In-World" Perspective** > Written from the perspective of a scholar or traveler within the world. The western [[Green Sea]] is home to many peoples, primarily humans and lizardfolk. Humans are, by far, the most numerous people of the region. The [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] have a long history in the [[Green Sea]] and although since the [[Great War]] they have mostly kept to themselves, Skaer sailors are commonly seen as far as [[Tollen]] and [[~South Cymea~|southern Cymea]]. [[Cymea]], once a powerful maritime empire, is in decline, and its numerous cities and coastal towns rarely exert influence beyond their borders. The lands [[~South Cymea~|to the south]], once a major [[Drankor|Drankorian province]], and later a trading partner with [[Isingue]], suffered greatly in the [[Great War]]. Although rumors of various squabbling realms have come north, few know what has emerged from the [[Blood Years]] there. The dwarves, known for their deep halls and mountain strongholds, are said to have a presence in the southern lands. In Cymea itself, they are scarce, and in the Skaer Islands, they are all but unheard of. Perhaps some secretive enclaves exist, but none have been recorded. Elves, while once more common, are now a rare sight. Most hail from distant Orenlas, but there are whispers of small communities of Rostare-born elves who may have found refuge here. If they exist, they keep to themselves, and few can say with certainty where they dwell.

[2/2/2025 10:50 AM] Deciusmus
oof pasted kinda bad

[2/2/2025 10:52 AM] Deciusmus
Ignore a bit the actual details, i.e. Rostare refugees or dwarves rare in Cymea, I was just using those as various details to work in, don't intend them to be canonical or even semi-canonical.

[2/2/2025 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus
I kind of prefer the player perspective for this

[2/2/2025 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
i think the problem with the in-world style is that it makes it hard to deal with the difference between in-world blank spots and just "not developed"

[2/2/2025 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus
cosmology is sort of the classic case for "people in world don't have access to the truth" so it works really well to just make undeveloped things in-world questions

[2/2/2025 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
but whether or not there is a significant population or an unusually low population of dwarves in cymea isn't a mystery, it just isn't decided

[2/2/2025 11:40 AM] Deciusmus
Right. That was the problem I was running into trying to write satisfying pages for Gazetteer stuff where development is incomplete

[2/2/2025 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[2/2/2025 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
basically write a largely in-world page, but have italicized call-outs

[2/2/2025 11:41 AM] Deciusmus
Right, I didn't explore the idea of writing "in-world" with explicit callouts for "not invented but not mysterious"

[2/2/2025 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
the other alternative is something like this that I put on the shadowfolds pages: (While there is more to say about the Shadowfolds, and significant lore likely exists, it largely has not been invented yet! - Eds.)

[2/2/2025 11:43 AM] Deciusmus
Yes, just landing

[2/2/2025 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess the other consideration is that the gazetteer is a lot of pages. i guess maybe you are thinking just region landing pages in the in-world style? i feel like most of the gazetteer is going to be written in more of a character-facing style than a true in-world style

[2/2/2025 11:45 AM] Deciusmus
Cosmology hits both (A) and (B). I think something like the Feywild realms section of the Gazetteer hits at least (B)

[2/2/2025 11:45 AM] Deciusmus
I think in-world style is really only valuable when (a) the number of pages is relatively low and there is some intrinsic fun in writing the in-world mysterious OR (b) there is high value in preserving in-game mystery and leaving answers to be discovered in game

[2/2/2025 11:47 AM] Deciusmus
There might be a few other places in the Gezetteer where A or B apply (i.e. a country like Ursk or Deno'qai tribes) where it might be nice to have the "full details" under a `%%`^Campaign:DuFr`%%` or `%%`Campaign:None`%%` and a short, in-world rumors page as the main landing

[2/2/2025 11:51 AM] Deciusmus
I guess for a specific gazetteer page, it is either (a) highly valuable to preserve in-game secrecy (meaning the details are either under a Campaign None, Campaign DuFr, or `%%`Secret`%%` tag) and there should be a short, in-game version of the page (b) not well-defined, but not highly valuable to have secrecy (in which case there isn't much on the page either way, as it isn't well defined) and the page is probably best as just a player facing "not much made up, here is what is known" (c) well-defined and not highly valuable to have secrecy, in which case the page is likely character-facing and outlines what is known in an "in world omniscient" perspective

[2/2/2025 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
right

[2/2/2025 11:55 AM] Deciusmus
But I think I agree that the gazetteer landing pages are much better and easier to write as player facing and link-dense, where if for example I wanted to write an in-world history page, you just link there for details

[2/2/2025 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
i'd suggest: - unlike cosmology, i don't think it is useful or achievable to have a specific tone for gazetteer - a lot of gazetteer secrets and undeveloped things, unlike cosmology, and things that someone in world knows about, just not the *players*, so in-world style is less useful in many (but not all) cases for finessing secrecy - the major driver of in-world writing should largely be fun, not game needs - in-world pages should use italicized editorial notes to clarify/explain undeveloped but not secret things

[2/2/2025 11:58 AM] Deciusmus
that is a very interesting idea

[2/2/2025 11:58 AM] Deciusmus
huh

[2/2/2025 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
that said it might be fun to write all the region landing pages from a halfling perspective for example, which could usefully give you in-world doubts and unknowns about dangerous / fringe places, while just using editorial comments to clarify when not much is said because of lack of development

[2/2/2025 11:58 AM] Deciusmus
yes I agree with all that

[2/2/2025 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
but, having player-facing region pages i think also works for simplicity

[2/2/2025 12:00 PM] Deciusmus
I might take a stab at a halfling perspective page for one of the easier/simpler regions and see how it feels from both a fun/effort and usefulness perspective

[2/2/2025 12:39 PM] Deciusmus
The halfling story of the western [[Green Sea]] is one of mariners and sailors, crumbing [[Cymea|coastal cities]] and proudly independent [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], numerous settlements along the coast, and mystery and danger inland. In the north, the halflings say, the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] are safe, and a good source of [[Skaer Steel|rare metals]] - but unwelcoming to outsiders looking to stay permanently. Those who do not worship the ocean god [[Kaikkea]] rarely find a home amongst the volcanoes and rocky hills of [[Skaerhem]]. The [[Cymean Peninsula]], and the [[~Cymean Archipelago~]] is a land of humans, long Drankorian provinces, and later a maritime power, it is now a place in decline. The numerous cities there are loosely called [[Cymea]] by the halflings, but a variety of different city-states squabble for dominance. (The halflings would know the details of Cymea, including what non-humans live amongst the humans, but it hasn't been invented yet. - Eds.) South of the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]], lies more [[~South Cymea~|human lands]], once Drankorian provinces and later, after the fall of Drankor, traders with the cities of the [[Istabor Alliance]]. Since the destruction of [[Isingue]] during the [[Great War]], this land is diminished. (The halflings would know the details of South Cymea, including what non-humans live there, but it hasn't been invented yet. - Eds.) Inland of the human settlements, the land turns dangerous, and halflings warn travelers away.

[2/2/2025 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
That works quite well I think

[2/2/2025 2:43 PM] Deciusmus
#### Cymean Era CY 5192 - CY 5678 After the fall of Drankor in DR 1059, [[Cymea]] emerged as a major maritime power, and although the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] attempted to expand in this period as well, they were not able to restore the ancient Skaer empire, and instead mostly raided the coasts of [[Sembara]] and [[Tyrwingha]]. By the time of the [[Great War]], it was [[Cymea]], not the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], who dominated the seas. (The sources for this period, including when exactly Cymea recovered from the fall of Drankor, and what Cymean cultures were competing or cooperating is hopelessly confused in the sources, and the Editors have not attempted here to untangle a most likely true version) #### Tollish Era (CY 5678 - Present) In the aftermath of the [[Great War]], [[Cymea]] suffered much, and was never able to reclaim its place as a maritime power. Instead, the navies of [[Tollen]] filled the gap, and in the modern day it is [[Tollen]] navies that dominate [[Western Cymea]] and the shipping lanes of the western [[Green Sea]]. Although the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] continue to live on their islands in relative isolation, they are no longer a power on the western [[Green Sea]].

[2/2/2025 2:43 PM] Deciusmus
#### Drankorian Era CY 4535 - 5192 As the Drankorian Empire expanded north, coastal provinces in the lands left behind by the vanished non-human empires ([[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]] and the [[~Ancient Lizardfolk Swamp~]]) were established quickly, although sources disagree as to the exact founding dates. Many local Cymean sources ascribe unrealistically early founding dates (such as DR 2 or DR 100) to local cities and provinces but few believe these. However, by DR 402 (CY 4535) the well-attested [[Treaty of Marhavn]] was signed in [[Tollen]], which formalized that withdrawal of the [[Skaer]] from all lands and seas west of the [[Volta]] and south of the [[Straits of Cymea]]. The [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] retreated in this period, and although numerous Skaer sailing vessels were seen along the coasts of [[Vostok]] and crossing between the islands of [[Skaerhem]], the western shores and bays of the [[Green Sea]] were dominated by the Drankorians, according to modern [[Cymea|Cymean]] histories. (Some the Cymean sources that define a Drankorian dominance may not be accurate, but alternative versions have not been invented yet! - Eds.)

[2/2/2025 2:43 PM] Deciusmus
what do you think: ## Major Historical Eras The story of the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] is well attested in religious and legendary sagas on the island, but independent verification of the facts is often difficult or impossible. The history of the [[Cymea|Cymean]] realms is difficult to untangle as many stories and chronicles have been written to justify modern events, and the truth of these chronicles is often questionable. That said, historians in [[Tollen]] will agree on at least a broad story: #### Skaer Era Before CY 4535 The [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] settled the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] in the ancient days before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], one of several human cultures that arose from the great [[~Mariners~|Mariner Exodus]] from [[Hkar]]. The Skaer established an maritime empire centered on the [[Vostok]] coast and the [[Western Gulf]], but also stretching as far south as the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]] and as far west as [[Embry]]. The Skaer claim their empire included the [[~Cymean Archipelago~]], but some [[Cymea|Cymean]] sources often describe the archipelago as uninhabited when the Drankorians arrived. Other sources claim the [[~Cymean Archipelago~]] was never Skaerish or Drankorian. (The details of what these "other sources" say is known but not yet invented. - Eds.)

[2/2/2025 3:02 PM] Deciusmus
But I pushed a Western Green Sea page that I'm pretty happy with

[2/2/2025 3:02 PM] Deciusmus
ok I have zachary's d&d game shortly so I need to switch from taelgar to pulling together a few notes on the Ghosts of Saltmarsh module I'm running for him

[2/2/2025 3:03 PM] Deciusmus
It is in-world with (Notes - Eds) where things are not made up. There are no intentional blank spots really so I didn't write "mysterious rumors" but you can see a little bit of how I left blank spots and undecided stuff in the historical story

[2/2/2025 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it works really well. obviously some bits are unfinished (e.g., geography / climate) and there are a few places i might add a bit of detail to cymea where i have a pretty good mental image (and there is some detail on western cymea invented but not well-documented). but i think the "halfling travelers" framework has a lot of potential. a few other notes on history in particular: - halflings record the song of each year, so there is also an opportunity to place canonical events that are not well-dated as happening "in the year of gentle rain" or whatever, without indicating when exactly that is in DR / CY (although I also like the cymean conflicting claims here) - halflings also have their ancestral memory, which is not exactly a photographic record but can be quite useful for vibes based stuff: "the ancestors long ago recall this as a land of Drankorian people, blah blah blah..." (and of course the ancestral memory does not need to be perfect or complete, but shouldn't be totally wildly wrong) for current day stuff (civilizations and culture): - i think it could use actually more of the vibes like "In the north, the halflings say, the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] are safe, and a good source of [[Skaer Steel|rare metals]] - but unwelcoming to outsiders looking to stay permanently. Those who do not worship the ocean god [[Kaikkea]] rarely find a home amongst the volcanoes and rocky islands of [[Skaerhem]]." i think that kind of thing is great

[2/2/2025 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
(also as an aside, i think you forgot to push the region map itself?)

[2/2/2025 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
this is great too: "_(The sources for this period, including when exactly Cymea recovered from the fall of Drankor, and what Cymean cultures were competing or cooperating is hopelessly confused in the sources, and the Editors have not attempted here to untangle a most likely true version)_"

[2/2/2025 6:31 PM] Deciusmus
i had forgotten

[2/2/2025 6:31 PM] Deciusmus
yeah I pushed a map

[2/2/2025 6:32 PM] Deciusmus
the page isn't really meant to be 100% done, just far enough to show the vibe.

[2/2/2025 6:33 PM] Deciusmus
For history, I was leaning a little bit more towards the "scholars in Tollen" approach and away from the halfling one just because imagining the historical conflicts was kinda fun, and I actually think that, outside of some of the framework documents, there is something to be said for the fact that there doesn't have to be one true history.

[2/2/2025 6:34 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. it may be fine to have something like The Skaer say X and the Drankorian records say Y without ever resolving which one is actually true, as long as they don't have major present day issues

[2/2/2025 6:35 PM] Deciusmus
But I agree the halfling stuff can be a useful way to convey uncertainity of information as well, i.e. The halflings, drawing on their ancestral memory, say that no humans have touched the land until the Drankorians arrived from the south in the Year of the Gentle Rain

[2/2/2025 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
poking around at region pages a little. i like the vibe and the basic framework a lot

[2/2/2025 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
whatever time i have for d&d stuff between now and tuesday has to be devoted to session prep, but as a general question: there are a few corners of the world i've done some secret development on, either because i potentially thought they might come up and didn't, or because i just have an idea for something that might make a good adventure. i'm not sure how to best indicate this - if at all - on the region pages.

[2/2/2025 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
*in world not in game

[2/2/2025 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
these would usually be on the edges of the map - i think there is not much value in secret worldbuilding for e.g. the north chardon coast where there isn't any reason it would be secret in-game. more like the vargaldi type places

[2/2/2025 9:31 PM] Deciusmus
I guess it depends a bit on what the implication of the secret is/was. In some cases why does it need to be indicated?

[2/2/2025 9:35 PM] Deciusmus
Something like, I dunno, a secret group of evil awakened trees on the western slopes of the north sentinels probably doesn't need a region note at all. It is small enough that it isn't really going to impact worldbuilding in the region and its sorta dubiously canonical, in that if it never comes up in an adventure is it really real?

[2/2/2025 9:39 PM] Deciusmus
Something like the Vargarldi, pre-discovery, which you want to be canonical even if we had never found them, is probably best done exactly how I wrote the vargardli text on the main northern green sea coast - I'm not sure there is huge value in keeping the fact that there are northerns up there secret - the interesting in game reveal was the details

[2/2/2025 9:48 PM] Deciusmus
There is probably stuff in between where it might make sense to add a short note in the DM Notes section (either on brainstorming or canonical, depending) to say something to just point out some minimal details of where the secret is

[2/3/2025 12:33 PM] Deciusmus
I'm probably going to try to do a little cleanup on gazetter today - a few little topics: (a) any objections to starting to separate out articles on places from peoples? 3 examples: - Drankor (the city) vs Drankorian Empire (the empire) - Skaer (the people) vs Skaerhaem (the islands) - Cymea (the province(s)) vs Cymean Peninsula (the place) (b) I think we agreed all unnamed places should go in staging? Might try to clean that up a bit

[2/3/2025 12:37 PM] Deciusmus
red blue or yellow

[2/3/2025 12:37 PM] Deciusmus
which one is Freccilia

[2/3/2025 12:37 PM] Deciusmus
Cymean Rivers:

[2/3/2025 12:50 PM] Deciusmus
(c) what brush did you use for rivers, do you know? there are 1 or 2 sembara tributaries I'd like to add to the official amp

[2/3/2025 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
For (c) - Rivers: KYLE sketch pencil rough (1 or 2), play with size, flow; color #181f5a

[2/3/2025 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
For (b) - yes, that is good to do. you might grab my dataview query from the Cosmology landing page to just make a table of backlinks in staging in directory in the dm notes for each region page

[2/3/2025 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
For (a) - reasonable; i think that we decided to put off for now final decisions about what belongs in Gazetteer vs elsewhere but it makes sense to make the pages. the Dunmar directory is already largely organized this way (separate pages on realms vs geography)

[2/3/2025 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
but pretty sure the place pages are all just stubs anyway and need me to fill in from my notes

[2/3/2025 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Also for (a) - really Drankor (the place) and all the other places in the "history" should be moved to gazetteer and Drankorian Empire (the realm) should probably stay in history for now

[2/3/2025 12:54 PM] Deciusmus
yeah for (a) wasn't going to move anything out of gazetter

[2/3/2025 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
*from your game

[2/3/2025 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i have a meeting in 5 minutes but when i get a chance this afternoon i need to figure out some fey politics for tomorrow and it would be helpful to understand a bit more of the context and the intended development for some of the stuff that touches on amberglow (i think from obsidian greymalkin and aelirios sunblade but i'm not totally clear)

[2/3/2025 12:57 PM] Deciusmus
Greymalkin's Story has pretty much everything I've made up

[2/3/2025 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
later this can be merged with the existing rivers

[2/3/2025 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
For (c) - you can make a new layer "new rivers" or something to test to make sure it looks good so you don't accidentally mess up existing rivers

[2/3/2025 12:58 PM] Deciusmus
ah

[2/3/2025 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
I was looking at this comment in Aeliros Sunblade: `%%` There is some background in [[Greymalkin's Story]] but I haven't really made anything up. I do have plans to use him some more `%%`

[2/3/2025 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
there are hints at some important story between Cedric / the Lantern of the Bright Hearth / Aerlirios Sunblade / the Order of the Charitable Wanderer but it isn't really clear exactly how it all connects and how, if at all, it connects back to Amberglow

[2/3/2025 1:02 PM] Deciusmus
but basically this is all post Cloudspinner; these events are all in the time period say 1300 - 1500 or so

[2/3/2025 1:02 PM] Deciusmus
I'm adding a page of The Refuge of the Gossamer Veil with the vibes so far

[2/3/2025 1:03 PM] Deciusmus
the only real idea is that Aerlirios was a fey paladin/warrior of some sort who was guarding/protecting some pocket of Amberglow that he was trying to keep safe / keep from falling to various forces that might be trying to take it over

[2/3/2025 1:04 PM] Deciusmus
he had some type of relationship with Cedric (a Tyrwinghan) - although Cedric's dates shouldn't be considered canonical

[2/3/2025 1:05 PM] Deciusmus
so in 1749 this is all history - this is part of Duskmire now

[2/3/2025 1:05 PM] Deciusmus
the other key thing about Aerlirios was that he died when Umbraeth took over the Refuge of the Gossamer Veil

[2/3/2025 1:05 PM] Deciusmus
he made a fancy magic item for Cedric

[2/3/2025 1:06 PM] Deciusmus
Cedric is kinda constructed to be a heroic inspiration/precursing to one of my PCs (Robin) with the idea that Robin could, in some fashion, be compared back to him / find his stuff / etc.

[2/3/2025 1:07 PM] Deciusmus
But I think the whole order of the charitable wanderer connection doesn't really work, and I never introduced it in game, because it seemed off

[2/3/2025 1:08 PM] Deciusmus
So really the only thing that I'd consider canonical is what's the Greymalkin's story. And the dates for Cedric probably need to move to pre-Great War, although I guess it is undetermined when Umbraeth took over the Refugee of the Gossamer Veil

[2/3/2025 1:09 PM] Deciusmus
The only real connection to Cloudspinner is that Aerilois Sunblade was presumably one of her knights (but actually, it he could have been born after she died, and could have just grown up in the Refuge, it isn't really clear)

[2/3/2025 1:24 PM] Deciusmus
I pushed some updates

[2/3/2025 1:31 PM] Deciusmus
Basically look at the new Refuge of Gossamar Veil page; I dropped the Charitable Wanderer connection and dumped a bunch of `%%` notes on my intended goals for these characters in the future. If you wanted to make Aerilios part of some larger "pro Cloudspinner" group, or have Aerilios' reason for caring about Cedric Cynwild be something to do with covert support Ethlenn was providing to refugees in Amberglow those both work. The chat on "Discord Chat - Fey Realms" in obisidian has a lot of (still accurate) stuff about Ethllen/Umbraeth/plans etc although I've committed very little of that as canonical

[2/3/2025 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
where is the Refuge of the Gossamar Veil supposed to be? Do you have any clear sense of the borders of Duskmire in 1720?

[2/3/2025 1:38 PM] Deciusmus
there is a map on the Duskmire page

[2/3/2025 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
(although the sunset gate doesn't have to be perfectly north-south)

[2/3/2025 1:40 PM] Deciusmus
yeah, it is old

[2/3/2025 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
that is slightly inaccurate in some details, e.g. Addermarch is not part of Ethlenn's domain and the sunset gate should run (mostly) north-south, with the darkwood on the west side, not the east side

[2/3/2025 1:40 PM] Deciusmus
although the southern border is not canonical

[2/3/2025 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
so wondering what is fixed and what is variable. the expansion of duskmire northwest to cleenseau obviously fixed

[2/3/2025 1:43 PM] Deciusmus
(d) Duskmire does **not** stretch as far east as Fellburn

[2/3/2025 1:43 PM] Deciusmus
basically the only canonical stuff is (a) Duskmire was originally just the Darkwood, which is just on the western side of Sunset Gate (b) Duskmire expanded after Cloudspinner was captured to include some fragments of the northern part of Amberglow (time and details not determined) (c) Duskmire today stretches as far north as the Wistel and includes the whole Cleenseau wood, but the western and eastern borders are unclear

[2/3/2025 1:44 PM] Deciusmus
right, or a similar vassal state

[2/3/2025 1:44 PM] rsulfuratus
sunset gate something like?

[2/3/2025 1:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right, fellburn area is presumably lord serenveil

[2/3/2025 1:45 PM] Deciusmus
that works, although I don't think it has to push as far east

[2/3/2025 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i am pretty sure i want addermarch on the other side of the sunset gate from twilight's grace

[2/3/2025 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i was just following major geographic features - istaros to hills to enst to coast to volta

[2/3/2025 1:46 PM] Deciusmus
but it doesn't have to be the full border

[2/3/2025 1:46 PM] Deciusmus
although it does need to touch Twlight's Grace somewhere

[2/3/2025 1:47 PM] Deciusmus
it should follow this line: Here an ancient line of border stones running to [[~High Peak of Tyrwinghan Ridge~]] demarcates the border with [[Tyrwingha]]. These stones are said by some to be raised by Drankor, but they are marked with complex warnings in [[Sylvan Writing|Sylvan]], and many believe they have fey origins.

[2/3/2025 1:47 PM] Deciusmus
right

[2/3/2025 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
and actively contested between duskmire and ethlenn vassals but not ethlenn herself

[2/3/2025 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but it could for example follow the teft instead of the volta, not sure that really matters in the north

[2/3/2025 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is the idea

[2/3/2025 1:49 PM] Deciusmus
yeah it doesn't matter to me. the Teft might make it a bit more in line with where it "should be"

[2/3/2025 1:52 PM] rsulfuratus
duskmire dark green

[2/3/2025 1:52 PM] rsulfuratus
shimmersong is yellow

[2/3/2025 1:52 PM] rsulfuratus
so you have then:

[2/3/2025 1:53 PM] Deciusmus
Are you thinking the Andonne, basically?

[2/3/2025 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
then the arrows are incursions into amberglow basically

[2/3/2025 1:53 PM] Deciusmus
I think the key question is where is the northern border of AMberglow before her capture

[2/3/2025 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
*west

[2/3/2025 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
(this is potentially before cloudspinner's capture as this is probably further north than amberglow)

[2/3/2025 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, duskmire can expand east as far as the mountains

[2/3/2025 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
roughly but not 100% exactly where and also need to give a bit of thought to isingue and a few other things

[2/3/2025 1:55 PM] Deciusmus
I personally think the history of Duskmire works a little bit better if Umbraeth can't easily expand when it is first granted, and he only grows when Cloudspinner falls

[2/3/2025 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
sure

[2/3/2025 1:56 PM] Deciusmus
just that it was probably Amberglow vassal states or whatever.

[2/3/2025 1:56 PM] Deciusmus
right, no didn't mean that

[2/3/2025 1:56 PM] Deciusmus
which suggests that the Maseau Gap/March of Andonne area probably should not have been "open"

[2/3/2025 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
right, but that's doesn't have to imply that amberglow borders darkwood

[2/3/2025 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. what lets duskmire take cleenseau?

[2/3/2025 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the unanswered question (more for your campaign than mine) is there needs to be something keeping duskmire from expanding north early that then fails

[2/3/2025 1:57 PM] Deciusmus
In fact, the Refugee of the Gossamar Veil could have been a mini-realm supported by Cloudspinner, not part of Amberglow proper

[2/3/2025 1:58 PM] Deciusmus
unless you have concerns, the idea was that pre-Great War Sharpshire stretched as far east as Cleanseau/Rinburg, but didn't go south of the Enst

[2/3/2025 1:58 PM] Deciusmus
we worked that out already in the chat

[2/3/2025 1:58 PM] Deciusmus
Ah, that is the Great War

[2/3/2025 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
ah hmm yeah i was not imagining sharpspire extending that far east into the lowlands

[2/3/2025 1:59 PM] Deciusmus
then when "mystery weird thing" replaced Sharpshire with "scary danger", Umbraeth took advantage

[2/3/2025 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
if you imagine that, originally, Sharpspire, Amberglow, and Twilight's Grace are three strong fey realms, allied to a degree that share a somewhat common purpose and morality

[2/3/2025 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but umbreath could have been constrained in other ways

[2/3/2025 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
even if there is some other random fey realms scattered around there, hard for umbreath to make a move with the three "major powers" of the east watching him

[2/3/2025 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
that puts a lot of eyes on the upper istaros and southern sembara

[2/3/2025 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
isn't really relevant exactly where the borders of these realms are

[2/3/2025 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
Sharpspire falls next, duskmire can expand north

[2/3/2025 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
Amberglow falls first, so duskmire can expand west / southwest

[2/3/2025 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
ethlenn's vassals still hold on in fellburn, wistel, ozabal, etc

[2/3/2025 2:03 PM] Deciusmus
yeah

[2/3/2025 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
(or at least, it might be relevant but the exact details don't matter for your campaign if the basic pattern of expansion holds)

[2/3/2025 2:04 PM] Deciusmus
although the exact details don't matter

[2/3/2025 2:04 PM] Deciusmus
there is actually probably more like 4 or 5 powers, because there needs to be something in the north as well

[2/3/2025 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
so that is the contested area now. ethlenn being the only of the three original "fey powers" still active in 1720

[2/3/2025 2:05 PM] Deciusmus
but lots of minor fey mostly with allegiances to one of the "big players" on the outside

[2/3/2025 2:05 PM] Deciusmus
where the pink circle is the "buffer zone" with no major archfey

[2/3/2025 2:05 PM] Deciusmus
but you could imagine something like:

[2/3/2025 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. there could be a sharp border in the north that duskmire can't expand into because it is controled by the Lord of the Beasts or whatever, but he is not a player in fey politics the way Ethlenn/Cloudspinner/unnamed lord of Sharpspire are/were

[2/3/2025 2:06 PM] Deciusmus
the northern realms could be inward looking

[2/3/2025 2:06 PM] Deciusmus
yeah

[2/3/2025 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm making a distinction between someone like the Lightdancer, who is clearly an archfey but also somewhat inward-looking, from the "big players" who are more outward-looking

[2/3/2025 2:07 PM] Deciusmus
Actually from a fey politics perspective I like the idea of some kind of alliance between Ethlenn / Sharpshire / Cloudspinner and this zone of allies between them, where all of the fey lords there are basically vassals to one of them

[2/3/2025 2:08 PM] Deciusmus
yeah I agree

[2/3/2025 2:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is better to keep the "major powers" relatively few - of course room for more invention in the north and to the west but i think probably other fey powers in greater sembara + upper istaros + eastern dunmar should largely not be "big players"

[2/3/2025 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
re: east, mostly ethlenn allies, no?

[2/3/2025 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
on a separate topic (related) - what is the Umbreath end game in your campaign? e.g. are you imagining your players are going to get deeply involved in fey politics and shake something up?

[2/3/2025 2:09 PM] Deciusmus
whatever keeps Umbraeth from moving east from duskmire or north is not well defined but also not a "big player" that looks outside its borders

[2/3/2025 2:11 PM] Deciusmus
and in fact might JUST be the portal in the Cleenseau wood

[2/3/2025 2:11 PM] Deciusmus
re: Umbraeth. The basic plotline I'm setting up is about access to the Material Plane. It is canonically important that the places where Umbraeth can get to the Material Plane that are also places where there are a lot of people is relativelty limited

[2/3/2025 2:12 PM] Deciusmus
at least, without treking across addermarch or maseau or whatever

[2/3/2025 2:12 PM] Deciusmus
So the "victory" condition is basically to shut down that portal, and lock him out of the human world

[2/3/2025 2:12 PM] Deciusmus
(the others being in the darkwood or the northern plaguelands or whatever)

[2/3/2025 2:13 PM] Deciusmus
I don't really envision them trying to overthrow Umbraeth or whatever, and Ethlenn is explicitly anti-expansionist

[2/3/2025 2:14 PM] Deciusmus
I could see my players being interested in a high level quest to try to retake some of Duskmire or whatever but I think that would intriscincally have to be after Cloudspinner is restored, or they have no place for allies

[2/3/2025 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a few basic possibilities i'm toying with but i'm curious how important it is that he be tied up and not feature too much in the next dunmar arc

[2/3/2025 2:15 PM] Deciusmus
unless he can get her to agree in some way that everything that is his is his forever

[2/3/2025 2:15 PM] Deciusmus
yeah he's going to hate it

[2/3/2025 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so obviously umbreath - assuming the situation is basically unchanged in 1749 - is going to have thoughts and feelings about Cloudspinner's return

[2/3/2025 2:16 PM] Deciusmus
I do not think he needs to be tied up

[2/3/2025 2:17 PM] Deciusmus
There is this weird unresolved question of whether the Cleenseau campaign cut him off from the material plane or not; if they fail I think he'd care less about the southern part of his realm

[2/3/2025 2:18 PM] Deciusmus
but honestly, it is probably better to run him as if they succeeded, and there is no fey portal in Cleenseau; easy enough for someone else to have succeeded between 1720 and 1749 if my PCs dont (and realsitically, it is pretty unusual for PCs to fail at major quests)

[2/3/2025 2:19 PM] Deciusmus
yeah I need to go get lunch before my 3pm meeting

[2/3/2025 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
i have another meeting but possibly more later

[2/3/2025 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/rsulfuratus/340_1_1_image.png.lG5sps1INx.png)

[2/3/2025 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
steel blue = shimmersong dark blue = sharpspire violet = twilight's grace yellow/orange = amberglow red = sunset gate exact boundries of dotted line "sphere of influence" not precise

[2/3/2025 6:23 PM] Deciusmus
can you change sunset gate to run up the teft, btw. I do have an "along the sunset gate" adventure planned, which will probably be along the Mostreve Hills Tyrwingha/Addermarch boundary but if I decide I don't want it there the Teft is much better than the Volta for various reasons

[2/3/2025 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but basically: sharpspire = highlands amberglow = river valleys west of sunset gate twilight's grace = orenlas + sembaran lowlands + river valleys east of sunset gate

[2/3/2025 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
sure

[2/3/2025 6:25 PM] Deciusmus
but the basic idea seems perfect

[2/3/2025 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
dotted line being "sunset gate runs somewhere roughly here tbd"

[2/3/2025 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
![](../External/.deciusmus_media/rsulfuratus/334_1_1_image.png.0rDeoRYosz.png)

[2/3/2025 6:28 PM] rsulfuratus
right the dotted lines are not canonical and have room for whatever

[2/3/2025 6:28 PM] Deciusmus
?

[2/3/2025 6:28 PM] Deciusmus
Although I would prefer if we don't settle on a canonical northern edge of this - this map puts all of Sembara under Ethlenn's "sphere of influence" or sharpspire, and I'm not 100% convinced that is correct. But I think for your purposes the exact details of the northern boundaries here (i.e. is Ethlenn's sphere actually only as far north as the Semb, or the Sharpspire one only as far north as the Wistel) doesn't really matter

[2/3/2025 6:29 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't think the politics of the feywild north of the mostreve will come up in the cloudspinner arc

[2/3/2025 6:31 PM] Deciusmus
I don't really have any strong feelings honestly

[2/3/2025 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
do you care?

[2/3/2025 6:31 PM] Deciusmus
none

[2/3/2025 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
you have presumably not given any thought to what is south of twilight's grace

[2/3/2025 6:32 PM] Deciusmus
but that could just be leakage on the Material Plane from the Darkwood or whatever.

[2/3/2025 6:32 PM] Deciusmus
Although the general vibe of Tyrwingha has been... "be careful in the hills, folks, if you go too far you might stray over the line and meet dark and dangerous fey"

[2/3/2025 6:33 PM] Deciusmus
The fey and material plane geography might not have an exact correspondence here

[2/3/2025 6:34 PM] Deciusmus
basically the yellow circle here:

[2/3/2025 6:35 PM] Deciusmus
Although I might care about the details sometime this summer, so if you make something up, it can't stay secret forever

[2/3/2025 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
but umbreath is trapped west of the sunset gate so this is not umbreath, correct?

[2/3/2025 6:35 PM] Deciusmus
but why that is does not matter in the slightlest to me

[2/3/2025 6:35 PM] Deciusmus
should be, in parts at least, on Taelgar at least, somewhat dangerous, enough that folks in Tyrwingha warn people about "going too far up in the hills"

[2/3/2025 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
well it isn't going to stay secret past March or April or whenever the cloudspinner arc finishes

[2/3/2025 6:37 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah

[2/3/2025 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i think addermarch works well as "contested territory" that is a buffer

[2/3/2025 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i like the umbraeth can't cross the sunset gate a lot

[2/3/2025 6:37 PM] Deciusmus
As far as Umbraeth: I don't think there should be a DIRECT border where Duskmire and Twilight's Grace touch each other I had this idea that Umbraeth can't cross the Sunset Gate but that doesn't have to be canonical

[2/3/2025 6:38 PM] Deciusmus
right

[2/3/2025 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so the west part of your yellow circle is addermarch contested land, the east part is maybe something else, with the sunset gate running in the middle

[2/3/2025 6:39 PM] Deciusmus
the only thing about the sunset gate is it is meant to be the actual line of sunset

[2/3/2025 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[2/3/2025 6:39 PM] Deciusmus
the plaguelands provides plenty of "non-fey" dangers

[2/3/2025 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
also i assume the sunset gate doesn't have to be fixed - i.e. there is no reason it couldn't have moved after cloudspinner's disappearance

[2/3/2025 6:39 PM] Deciusmus
yes. although the ENTIRE yellow circle doesnt' have to be dangerous. The only canonical thing I'm working with here is a general vibe in the foothill/border towns in Tyrwingha that the hills aren't safe, and that in particular, the fey you might encounter in the hills might be dangerous in unexpected ways

[2/3/2025 6:40 PM] Deciusmus
I have no opinions about whether the actual line of sunset can move or not

[2/3/2025 6:41 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. it could have been that Ethlenn retreated due to some impact of the Plague/red mist

[2/3/2025 6:41 PM] Deciusmus
secondarily, btw, there is no requirement that this "Dangerous fey area" has to have predated the Great War

[2/3/2025 6:44 PM] Deciusmus
As an aside, looking at that map, I actually think it might work better if the Refuge of the Gossamer Veil was in the "Amberglow influence" area, not in Amberglow itself.

[2/3/2025 6:55 PM] rsulfuratus
But in some sense the distinction is a bit artificial

[2/3/2025 6:55 PM] rsulfuratus
Right. I think my idea is that all the feywild is divided into domains of influence, but “Amberglow proper” or whatever might be smaller than “amberglow extended”

[2/3/2025 6:56 PM] rsulfuratus
It just gives space for inventing a bunch of minor archfey and allows boundaries to be sharp in some places and gradual in others

[2/3/2025 6:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Separately: my feeling is that some archfey (ethlenn, cloud spinner among those invented so far) are ancient (possibly predating the riving) and significantly more powerful than “typical archfey”

[2/3/2025 6:59 PM] rsulfuratus
Others are various gradations of power. But probably there are not more than half a dozen of the “great fey” or whatever in the region from west coast through western green sea

[2/3/2025 7:39 PM] rsulfuratus
(the names often need some pushing although that one is not bad)

[2/3/2025 7:39 PM] rsulfuratus
kind of want to put this somewhere: Gloamscar – A land where daylight has been wounded, the sky torn open to reveal something older and darker than the Feywild itself, watched over by the fey warlock Severance, Keeper of the Rift.

[2/3/2025 7:39 PM] Deciusmus
I do not

[2/3/2025 7:39 PM] rsulfuratus
do you pay for chatgpt? i don't know if they have updated things recently but I've found the recent versions of the 4o model to be shockingly creative

[2/3/2025 7:40 PM] Deciusmus
maybe that's where Gloamscar is

[2/3/2025 7:40 PM] Deciusmus
I have often wondered what this is:

[2/3/2025 7:46 PM] rsulfuratus
once i decide what I'm using for this adventure i'm going to dump 100 raw ideas from chatgpt in brainstorming for fey realms.

[2/3/2025 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
not that i would use them exactly but might be useful to see the vibes

[2/3/2025 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
duskhounds?

[2/3/2025 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
*servant

[2/3/2025 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
you said you had some umbraeth enemy stats?

[2/3/2025 9:08 PM] Deciusmus
It’s aimed to be “boss-level” for 6th level party

[2/3/2025 9:08 PM] Deciusmus
Yes I have a stated duskhound. I’m not at my computer but can send you in a bit

[2/3/2025 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
the new monster manual is coming out tomorrow so i may also see if there is anything interesting in there

[2/3/2025 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd take a look

[2/3/2025 9:10 PM] Deciusmus
I have a couple of other stat’d fey enemies as well if you want - other bosses mostly for my current “fey enemies” arc

[2/3/2025 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
there is rumored to be a statblock for a city-sized ooze, for example, just coincidentally

[2/3/2025 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
supposed to have more interesting high level monsters

[2/3/2025 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
(in worldbuilding)

[2/3/2025 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
just put it in mechanics and push it

[2/3/2025 9:18 PM] Deciusmus
not sure the best way to share bestiary. I have a bunch of stuff stat'd in obsidian in my DM folder..

[2/3/2025 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yes

[2/3/2025 9:19 PM] Deciusmus
do you have the fantasy stat block plugin?

[2/3/2025 9:19 PM] Deciusmus
I forgot we had a worldbuilding\mechanics

[2/3/2025 9:21 PM] Deciusmus
pushed

[2/3/2025 9:24 PM] Deciusmus
in play my PCs fought 2 different duskhounds; one was a ordered to stay put and guard a retreat, so didn't use its mostly infinite misty step mobility. That was not super hard (esp as the whole party made the save against fright aura). The other was jumping around with every attack and was much much more of a challenge.

[2/3/2025 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
is that the vibe from your game?

[2/3/2025 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
one more. my sense of umbraeth's vibe is all about rigged games, about cruelty, about the idea of the hunt. despite the way the duskhounds are statted it really isn't about like the fear of darkness or traditional ghost story kind of things

[2/3/2025 9:44 PM] Deciusmus
Yeah

[2/3/2025 9:45 PM] Deciusmus
But ultimately the duskhounds have a bit of an enforcer vibe

[2/3/2025 9:45 PM] Deciusmus
The fey bosses are probably a bit more “themed”

[2/3/2025 9:46 PM] Deciusmus
I mean not actually mindless. But they aren’t his lieutenants- they are more like his muscle

[2/3/2025 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
right yeah, but the fear aura is more about they are scary (like how a dragon is scary) than about some innate connection to fear (like how drankor is terrifying)

[2/3/2025 9:46 PM] Deciusmus
They are supposed to be a bit mindless

[2/3/2025 9:47 PM] Deciusmus
Yes, the fear aura more about “they are scary”

[2/3/2025 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i am making a minion version of duskhounds for you all

[2/3/2025 9:51 PM] Deciusmus
Or ie I wouldn’t expect Umbraeth to have 100s of them around.

[2/3/2025 9:51 PM] Deciusmus
I do see the duskhounds as a little bit like “mini Nazgûl” or something less like soldiers, ie I wouldn’t expect them in general to be quite as weak as minions, although I guess some minions can be relatively strong

[2/3/2025 9:52 PM] Deciusmus
Ive been running them as more like lieutenants than foot soldiers

[2/3/2025 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
*then

[2/3/2025 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe i'll make something else to be the foot soliders them

[2/3/2025 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay, the vibe seemed a bit more like the foot soliders

[2/3/2025 9:53 PM] Deciusmus
He has sent single ones of them to enforce stuff

[2/5/2025 11:49 AM] Deciusmus
btw, I assume idea of Amberglow was meant to harken back to the Lantern of the Bright Hearth, i.e. likely Aerlios made it out of Amberglow or it in some fashion has some relationship to Amberglow

i liked your midjourney image so ran with it

[2/5/2025 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
the Lantern is not itself an Amberlight, but the vibe was inspired by it

[2/5/2025 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
Amberlights, yes

[2/5/2025 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
(of course eventually they all went dark)

[2/5/2025 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea is supposed to be a way for the refuges and defenses of amberglow to hang on without Cloudspinner's direct power

[2/5/2025 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Aelirios presumably was one of the fey lords who had an amberlight and used it to do things

[2/5/2025 2:31 PM] Deciusmus
Right. So Robin's lantern could be an echo of an echo, i.e. like how the phial of Galadriel is an echo of an echo of the light of the Simarils

[2/6/2025 9:22 PM] Deciusmus
Have you thought at all about in what specific way Umdikza is related to undeath?

[2/7/2025 11:34 AM] Deciusmus
I've been playing with GPT 4o (which I get about 20 minutes free a day on the free plan) and you are right it is way more creative than older chat gpts

[2/7/2025 11:35 AM] Deciusmus
mostly session prep stuff, as I have a game on Sunday; but I'm also working on my March session prep, which is where the question about Umdikza comes from

[2/7/2025 11:35 AM] Deciusmus
I'm home sick today but feeling better than I was yesterday so I am working on taelgar stuff a bit

[2/7/2025 11:57 AM] Deciusmus
Anyway the point being if you do have any thoughts or feelings would be useful to share if you have a moment

[2/7/2025 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but i should have a bit of time later this afternoon

[2/7/2025 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i have actually had to work the past couple of days as i didn't work much earlier this week as i was behind on session prep; i also have been messing with roll20 to improve automation to make combat run faster (wrote an API script to automatically prompt concentration checks on damage, for example)

[2/7/2025 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Umdikza, I haven't really thought much about the three despairs. actually despite having a fair bit of notes on undead (many of which are in the undead note or in the various fate of souls / land of the dead / funerary tradition notes), i'm not sure there is much, or any, canonical lore that exists about Umdikza, except perhaps whatever you invented for your Ausson's Crossing game

[2/7/2025 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm actually not sure that the basic framework of the Void Mind -> Three Despairs -> Embodied Gods necessarily makes sense and it honestly has not come up in lore. Jinnik keeps getting treated as an embodied god (e.g., see the Pandemonium note), and Thark of course is an embodied god

[2/7/2025 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
the Void Mind clearly is a useful game contstruct to generate evil gods while overall keeping the Divine Presence essentially god aligned (and is in some respects a replacement for the Tokien-derived Melkor/etc in high school)

[2/7/2025 12:54 PM] Deciusmus
in the aussons crossing game I ended up not reall using a connection to the "void mind" per se

[2/7/2025 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
that said: I think there is some value in having some kind of god-like entity that somehow makes the transition to the land of the dead / the journey through the land of the dead dangerous

[2/7/2025 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
as its now been almost 5 years of running games in "modern" Taelgar (longer if you count the non-canonical early Plaguelands campaign), i'm increasingly inclined to drop metaphysical concepts that were invented early on but have never impacted in-game lore

[2/7/2025 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
otherwise, why all the focus on rituals to protect the dead and why the gidari to guard the land of the dead and all taht

[2/7/2025 12:56 PM] Deciusmus
I was originally thinking it was somehow related to one of the Three Despairs but ultimately it never came up in game and the whole metaphysics actually works better for it to have been some Far Realms interusion

[2/7/2025 12:56 PM] Deciusmus
the only thing that came up in game was a abberation that had appeared in the old dwarven mines and was ultimately trying to grow large and strong enough to "fully break free"

[2/7/2025 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
some of it could be demons and devils but that doesn't feel like the complete answer, and that can't explain the perceived dangers of getting lost on the material plane afte death before reaching the land of the dead in the first place

[2/7/2025 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[2/7/2025 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
more brainstorming: another observation is that undead are more common in places of traumatic death, and especially lots of traumatic death. e.g., all the plague-affected places (kharsan, drankor); the zombies in sembara tending to rise (at least in part) from old battlefields; just general D&D/adventure planning usefulness

[2/7/2025 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
so, i think that suggests: the transition a soul makes from the material plane to the land of the dead in some way opens an extraplanar portal. this allows the soul to depart, but also, sometimes, allow something else to sneak in

[2/7/2025 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Umdikza is that something else. their exact origins can be totally mysterious (in game and out of game), although in some way derived from the void mind, most likely (as opposed to e.g. demon lords that likely arise from humanity's worst impulses via the divine spark)

[2/7/2025 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
umdikza and jinnik are more like malevolent forces

[2/7/2025 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is useful to keep the vibe of umdikza and jinnik separate from the vibe of thark

[2/7/2025 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
jinnik canonically "lives" in pandemonium, but one interpretation of that is jinnik **is** pandemonium

[2/7/2025 1:04 PM] Deciusmus
but why that is is undefined

[2/7/2025 1:04 PM] Deciusmus
metaphysically thark is more like an embodied god and jinnik and umdizka are more like mos numena archtype gods

[2/7/2025 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yes

[2/7/2025 1:04 PM] Deciusmus
Right so is the suggestion to just get rid of the "Three Despairs" as a concept, and instead have (a) the Void Mind (b) these mysterious "bad things" created by it which canonically include Thark, the Mad One (perhaps retconned to be the same as Jinnick), and Umdikza but which don;t have canonical creation stories (c) further "bad things" can be invented as needed (but cautiously, there shouldn't be more than probably 4-5 total)

[2/7/2025 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. and i agree that probably 4-6 or so is the right number

[2/7/2025 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
to the extent that there is a need for an "outer plane of endless war" that can already be thark's domain

[2/7/2025 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean if you look at basic monster types there is not that much left to explain after thark (orcs), jinnik (lycanthropes), umdizka (undead), plus all the other stuff that's been invented

[2/7/2025 1:08 PM] Deciusmus
my actual goal is that (a) the next adventure in cleenseau is that the PCs are going to be sent to find one piece of the lich's phylactery (he has hidden 3 pieces around) (b) I have established that the phylactery is hidden in a creepy old ruin in the wilderness (c) there could be lots of sources for "creepy old ruin" but I was thinking an abandoned cult temple to Umdizka might be interesting (or some other "evil" temple) (d) that requires some thought about WHY there would be a cult temple associated with Umdizka and what that would mean, although the details can be a bit vague given it was long abandoned

[2/7/2025 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
nine hells and abyss already exist and have origin stories not fully developed but not connected to the void mind

[2/7/2025 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so one thing i was thinking about is that you could think of necromancy magic as arising from two very different sources

[2/7/2025 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
this kind of magic, while probably perceived as largely evil, might not be irredemmibly evil and you could image a society where this is kind of normal, you have skeleton minions, etc

[2/7/2025 1:10 PM] Deciusmus
(but I'm not really sure umdizka is the right source here, actually - although I like the changes above about simplifying the void mind metaphysyics)

[2/7/2025 1:10 PM] Deciusmus
(the theory behind umdizka was that malach knew about this because he found some key to being a lich here)

[2/7/2025 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
(1) 'traditional arcane magic' can animate a body, just like it can animate a ladder or a rock. but it can't create an ensouled undead

[2/7/2025 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) 'undead soul magic' or whatever you want to call it is much more about how to break the bonds between a soul and the land of the dead or whatever, some complex metaphysics that stop the inevitable pull of the Plane of Creation that ultimately draws all souls to it

[2/7/2025 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
a lot of the details and rituals around binding a soul to the material plane theorectically overlap the details and rituals of constructing a phylactery

[2/7/2025 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
this magic would probably be irredemably evil, and likely would be somehow associated with umdizka

[2/7/2025 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
so there could be natural connection between the headquarters of a cult of necromancers and a lich

[2/7/2025 1:17 PM] Deciusmus
yeah, a cult of necromancers could work; I like all the metaphysics there

[2/7/2025 1:27 PM] Deciusmus
so how do you think this works with those metaphysics: Malach, in his quest to discover the true nature of souls and life and death founded a sanctuary of seers and experimental magicians hidden away in the Cleenseau Wood. They sought to discover true nature of the Land of the Dead and what exactly the nature of life and death is. In their experiments, they unknowingly drew the attention of Umidzka. The seers have their souls taken by Umdizka, leaving behind only lifeless eyes, haunted to endlessly watch the sanctuary, and an endless connection to Umdizka, which fills the place with despair and emptiness and a sense of losing the will to live

[2/7/2025 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that's fine. i guess i would want to leave the "their souls taken by umdizka" a little vague - as in, if umdizka is the force that creates things like haunts and ghasts and other "lingering signs of death" undead, which are abanonded souls / disconnected from the plane of consciousness / plane of creation, there is a bit of tension with also "consuming" souls

[2/7/2025 2:03 PM] Deciusmus
Actually maybe their souls are all still their trapping in their eyes which is all that’s left of them

[2/7/2025 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but that doesn't mean it can't happen, just the exact metaphysics of why in this case you have soulless husks and in other cases you have disembodied souls should be flexible

[2/7/2025 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
you could imagine metaphysically that umdizka consumse souls starting from the plane of creation side leaving them disembodied and cut off, but this time just kept going and ate the whole thing

[2/7/2025 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
or in this case umdizka consumed their souls as punishment for malach trying (or succeeding) in using umdizka's knowledge/magic/whatever for his own purposes

[2/7/2025 2:06 PM] Deciusmus
Right I guess that also works. I need to play around a bit with both what long term clues there might be here as well as what the actual in game challenges are going to be

[2/7/2025 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i think there are lots of possibilities just the only restriction should be not to devise an explanation/metaphysics/in game clues that conflict with the idea that umdizka is also probably behind "lost souls" and related undead

[2/7/2025 2:12 PM] Deciusmus
But I could push it out to June if you cloudspinner arc is going to be long, but I kinda assume not?

[2/7/2025 2:12 PM] Deciusmus
When do you think the cloudspinner arc will be over? I’d like to use some of your stuff potentially for my feywild arc which will start either in april or may.

[2/7/2025 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
it is complicated because of Eric's situation as I don't necessarily want him to miss the whole thing but it is hard to predict when he'll feel like playing (and if he is taking a 6 month break we'll just have to do stuff without him)

[2/7/2025 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so i haven't really plotted beyond the next session really although i obviously have an arc but it could be 4 sessions or it could be 8 sessions (would be hard to make it longer than that)

[2/7/2025 2:17 PM] Deciusmus
It doesn’t really matter right now - but probably I will make the Malach phylactery 2 sessions instead of 1 and then I’ll need to have a better idea. But that’s April, things should be much clearer with Eric by then. Mostly if you knew it was going to be wrapped up by April no matter what I was going to write the phylactery hunt as one session

[2/7/2025 2:18 PM] Deciusmus
My arc is basically - fight a hag (next session) - phylactery - potentially 1-2 sessions of filler - feywild arc

[2/7/2025 2:20 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean assuming that we stick to the pretty constant 2 sessions a month we've had for the past 5 years then i'd expect the cloudspinner arc to end no earlier than mid-April and no later than late May

[2/7/2025 2:20 PM] Deciusmus
But if I do 2 sessions of filler and 2 sessions of phylactery that’s July for the feywild arc which I assume would be fine

[2/7/2025 2:21 PM] Deciusmus
Right so I’ll just need to decide in April when I’m working on my May session whether it’s kicking off the feywild arc or is filler

[2/7/2025 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah both in and out of game should be clearer about when the cloudspinner arc will wrap up by then

[2/9/2025 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
i am getting a little carried away with feywild stuff, which i'm planning on pushing tonight and updating taelgarverse in prep for session thursday. a lot of the detail i'm writing is an expansion of the lore recorded by Ulfgar Frostbeard in his book, The Lore of the Feywild. currently, i'm writing this mostly on the note for The Lore of the Feywild itself, with some minor details/repetition on realm pages. i think this is consistent with just getting rid of primary sources as a category and trying to move the stuff there (eventually) into the relevant directories (e.g., religion, species, etc) but curious if you have other thoughts here

[2/9/2025 11:58 AM] Deciusmus
I agree with the basic idea

[3/3/2025 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
i've been pretty busy at work the past few weeks and then in my spare time have mostly been doing session prep and working on roll20 api scripts to automate some annoying aspects of combat, so haven't had much time to do any taelgarverse updates. but today is fairly light, actually, so i'm likely going to try to push a few updates, mostly probably focusing on region pages and check/tim stuff. fyi in case you are using your recovery as an excuse to not work much today

[3/30/2025 11:45 AM] Deciusmus
I don't suppose you are around? I had a quick Moon-related question for my game in 30 minutes that I wanted to run by you

[4/29/2025 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
do you remember what the cool idea for the moon we had at Backbar was? something about prison for something?

[4/29/2025 5:48 PM] Deciusmus
i.e. what's his name, the god of slavery

[4/29/2025 5:48 PM] Deciusmus
it was a prison for the gods who had been banished

[4/29/2025 5:54 PM] Deciusmus
so to speak

[4/29/2025 5:54 PM] Deciusmus
hence the bazaraheal getting some moon people going

[4/29/2025 5:54 PM] Deciusmus
and then the big plot thing was that in my game some aberration/far realm entity was trying to break open the moon

[4/29/2025 5:54 PM] Deciusmus
I think we had some other thoughts about how that would make the moon a bit complex, i.e. a prison / entity holding in the bad, but also some degree of the bad leaking out

[4/29/2025 5:55 PM] Deciusmus
right

[4/29/2025 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i remember now. i think my idea was to make it ambigious if the moon itself as prisoner was also a "bad god" punished by being made into a prisoner or some kind of hero assigned the task

[4/30/2025 8:04 PM] Deciusmus
yes

[4/30/2025 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
A while ago we talked about a feywild arc in your game that might draw on some of the stuff I’ve developed recently. The cloud spinner arc is presumably wrapping up tomorrow and hopefully in about 1-2 weeks things at work will settle down a bit. So I’m close to in a position to push a bunch of new Feywild details. Is it still relevant?

[4/30/2025 8:05 PM] Deciusmus
but after the lich reveal and getting the piece of the phylatcry, PCs will end up in the feywild

[4/30/2025 8:05 PM] Deciusmus
my plot is running a bit slow because we skipped April and June, so we only have a May and July game

[4/30/2025 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Great will easily have time to clean up and push a bunch of stuff well before then

[4/30/2025 8:06 PM] Deciusmus
realistically August, as I think the lich plot will take 2 sessions

[4/30/2025 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Ah okay so that is likely July at earliest? That’s perfect

[5/17/2025 5:11 PM] Deciusmus
So I’m finally running the Umdizka temple / ruin adventure tomorrow

[5/17/2025 5:12 PM] Deciusmus
The basic story is a place of research and learning re: souls is founded by Malach before he is known to be evil

[5/17/2025 5:13 PM] Deciusmus
Then he pushes deep into learning re: undead and lich-stuff - which eventually has some interactions with Umdizka and leaves the place ruined and corrupted. Malach leaves with whatever knowledge

[5/17/2025 5:15 PM] Deciusmus
In game this matters as I want some interesting ghost

[5/17/2025 5:15 PM] Deciusmus
Question: would it be out of place to have a Lakan monk involved before it became evil, perhaps attracted by the idea of a cross-cultural magical center of learning and research.

[5/17/2025 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
getting to reuse a bunch of stuff

[5/17/2025 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
running game for isaac + friends at the moment but will look in a bit while isaac is cooking. they are in castrella right now

[5/17/2025 6:38 PM] Deciusmus
1600

[5/17/2025 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
it would be a little unusual but not out of place. when was this going on?

[5/17/2025 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
could be that the lakan monk was traveling in part to learn more about hobgoblins or something in the context of the northern war

[5/17/2025 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
but that doesn't mean it can't happen

[5/17/2025 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
only problem is travel from dunmar to sembara is pretty difficult at that time, that is in the middle of one of the dunmar/hobgoblin wars

[5/17/2025 8:58 PM] Deciusmus
(had friends over for dinner, so kinda lost the thread of this) my other idea was an elven scholar of some sort. realistically, I think this character is going to be minor, i.e. basically it is more backstory that might not even come up, or perhaps if the PCs are struggling a ghost of some sort who has been hiding out

[5/23/2025 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
messing around a bit with rivers in taelgarverse, primarily filling out the rest of the west coast chasa-nahadi system, where i have a lot of notes but not many names from the great library campaign. did we ever decide how we are supposed to organize these, e.g. if a river or river system flows through multiple gazetteer regions? for now i am putting them in the region if they are fully contained, and in major rivers if not, but i'm not sure that is ideal and ends up being kind of arbitrary based on where lines are drawn and not actually based on river size/length. i don't know if you have any thoughts or opinions or if it really matters much. an alterernative would be to put all of the chasa-nahadi watershed into major rivers, for example

[5/23/2025 12:01 PM] Deciusmus
I think in the east the rivers are all pretty much in a region.

[5/23/2025 12:02 PM] Deciusmus
I think it is reasonable to keep rivers together though, ie have the “chasa - nahadi” as a folder

[5/23/2025 12:05 PM] Deciusmus
But if I was just cleaning up rivers on the map from notes I might be inclined to just dump in the root river system and if that is outside a single region, fine

[5/23/2025 12:05 PM] Deciusmus
But it is also probably fine if it is a bit arbitrary, if I was making up some small tributary of the Istabor that was mostly relevant for some adventure in Maseau I might be tempted to put it in the Maseau folder rather than some istabor folder

[5/24/2025 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
pushing a bunch of great library geography stuff. haven't gotten to updating region pages but just in case you are curious...

[5/27/2025 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed an updated version of Vindristjarna Bastion rules that updates to the official versions in the DMG (from the old UA versions), and also clarifies the basic idea of how I think a mobile bastion might work (where you are constrained by space and crew instead of having to visit the bastion to gain benefits)

[5/27/2025 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
feel free to edit, add things, etc. i doubt that anyone else in the party will engage particularly deeply

[5/28/2025 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
proposed reorg of campaign directory, inspired by trying to get more OneNote stuff (mostly Great Library) into obsidian: (1) Reorganize with top-level directories for the four major canonical campaigns, (Cleenseau, Addermarch, Great Library, Dunmar), plus Mawar. (2) Add an Adventures top-level directory with a landing page, plus sub-directories for canonical and semi-canonical 1-4 session adventures. Right now Ausson's Crossing and Labyrinth of the Lost have campaign directories, while other short adventures do not, or don't have anything useful in them anyway. (3) Move Mechanics and Player's Guide to Background Open Questions: (1) Where to put non-canonical or semi-canonical stuff? Could make a Non-Canon directory to put any notes for non-canonical stuff as desired, but this will function more or less like the Brainstorming and/or Tentative parts of Worldbuliding and might just make sense to put in, say, Worldbuilding/Campaigns or something. (2) What do do with Great War? It is kind of in a unique semi-canonical position (other semi-canonical stuff is generally in the framework of "the background material is real but the events may not be", while great war is more "the setting has changed but the events are real")

[5/28/2025 12:30 PM] Deciusmus
In general I think moving stuff to worldbuilding is usually the right move though

[5/28/2025 12:30 PM] Deciusmus
I like that as a basic idea. Might not have time to think about in detail right now though

[5/28/2025 12:31 PM] Deciusmus
For semi-canon

[5/28/2025 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a reorg. happy to revert things you don't like in the future if you have more time to think

[5/28/2025 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
still planning on fiddling a bit more later today, although have meetings for a good chunk of the afternoon. the semi-canonical stuff (Great War, Ausson's Crossing, Stone Titan) likely to prove most complex but for now dumped it all into worldbuilding/campaigns

[5/28/2025 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
(which, separately, needs a bit of work)

[5/28/2025 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and hence live in the PCs directory

[5/28/2025 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
excepting Ausson's Crossing and Great War PCs, which are canonical (Great War definitely, Ausson's Crossing according to what you've written in the campaigns directory)

[5/28/2025 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
final update on campaigns. while not everything is filled out, basic organization now puts dunmar, cleenseau, addermarch, great library, mawar, plus canon one shots (oskar + riswynn, western cymea low level) in campaigns. all of these also have at least a PC directory, although some dont have anything there yet. ausson's crossing and great war get PC directories, but not campaign directories, as the details of the story is not necessarily canon ausson's crossing, great war, and stone titan get directories in worldbuilding/campaigns. there is also a non-canon in worldbuilding/campaigns with some notes from plaguelands, aborted family version of cleenseau i will likely mess around with the organization of my version of taelgar to make an "Other Campaigns" landing page for my "Other Campaigns" TOC. however for now the only complete list of campaigns in in the Campaigns/campaigns.md note, which is not intended to be published

[6/1/2025 1:15 PM] rsulfuratus
fwiw, i think my feywild arc notes are more or less completely incorporated. many are still behind secret blocks and i didn't really have the energy to figure out if there are any actual secrets remaining but easy enough to do if there are specific pages you are drawing from for developing any upcoming feywild stuff in your campaign that pulls from this (especially Harrow/Wend stuff - never figured out the exact map but Hollowdark and/or Darkfall are more or less immediately south of Twilight's Grace

[6/13/2025 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus
guessing you are too busy at work and with trip prep to think about taelgar much, but in case not: i am working on the next adventure for my addermarch campaign, and it is likely to impinge on the feywild a bit, which is leading me to finally try to anchor this in time. contemplating two main options, which have different implications. option 1 is roughly contemporaneous with your cleenseau game, probably either a few years before (e.g., around 1715) or a few years after (e.g. around 1725). this potentially allows a fair bit of reuse of material between games, but requires a bit of coordination to keep the timeline untangled, especially concerning feywild politics (although i will likely focus more on Hollowdark / Darkfall than Duskmire) option 2 is around 1740, say 5-10 years before the dunmar campaign begins. this makes it a bit more challenging to reuse material as it puts it about a generation after your game, but simplifies the coordination problems to a certain extent as the cleenseau events are then just "history" and easier to leave in the background do you have any opinions?

[6/13/2025 10:53 AM] Deciusmus
I actually kinda like contemporaneous

[6/13/2025 10:59 AM] Deciusmus
have a meeting but more thoughts in a bit

[6/13/2025 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
i kind of do too, but it puts a little more pressure on both of us to keep game notes updated was my only hesitation...

on a related topic, here is my feywild map. (1) Twilight's Grace (2) undefined, needs work (3) Duskmire + extensions (4) Darkfall (5) Hollowdark (6) Amberglow (7) Shimmersong (8) Sharpspire (9) Everlight's Bloom (10) Emberwine red line is Sunset Gate east of Darkfall and south of Hollowdark are also undefined. east of Darkfall overlaps Orenlas and should be allied with Twilight's Grace; south of Hollowdark less clear, I had some rough idea of a land of peaceful dreams or something like that

So in general I’m happy to commit to better sharing/notes. We have had some scheduling issues and slow role play focused sessions so plot is a little behind. I think setting Addermarch a little bit before Cleenseau is easier than a little bit after although I’m not sure.

[6/13/2025 12:15 PM] Deciusmus
Basically I have two big plot things coming up- 1) The Gloomshaper is going to attempt to kidnap Elaine II (Queen of Sembara post Lich) and use her connection to Ethlenn to permanently open the portal to Cleenseau

[6/13/2025 12:16 PM] Deciusmus
2) PCs are likely going to stop this and end up needing to escape from Duskmire, likely via the poorly defined #2 on your map 3) at some point I expect they will go on an adventure in Feywild to find more info about Greymalkin’s origin and get him his wings back

[6/13/2025 12:17 PM] Deciusmus
Just before Clee has the advantage that the outcome of #1 doesn’t matter.

[6/13/2025 12:18 PM] Deciusmus
And also that anything my PCs do to shake up things unexpectedly doesn’t cause issues

[6/13/2025 12:20 PM] Deciusmus
Kinda think 1715 for addermarch is pretty good. Your campaign feels not that likely to create some regional-impacting event

[6/13/2025 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i am leaning that way

[6/13/2025 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't expect this will likely get to particularly high levels and is mostly built around the possibility that we could just end the campaign after any adventure

[6/13/2025 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but that is likely more of a worldbuilding thing to plan, and less something that is likely to be reshaped in play

[6/13/2025 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
the only complication is that Nathaniel's backstory does tie to some of the minor fey realms in #2

[6/13/2025 12:27 PM] Deciusmus
I'm pretty swamped between now and Africa

[6/13/2025 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
i have meetings from 1-3 but otherwise a pretty light day

[6/13/2025 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
i am currently writing the next addermarch adventure which is going to involve a minor fey incursion, so i may try to work out some of the details of #2 a bit

[6/13/2025 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
the main vibe i want to maintain is that addermarch feels very distinct from tyrwingha. while tyrwingha is protected by ethlenn, addermarch is explicitly contested, so you never know if the fey you encounter is "good" or "bad", using those terms very loosely

[6/13/2025 12:28 PM] Deciusmus
I haven't introduced anything other than a few hints about the "minor lords" type "buffer zone"

[6/13/2025 12:28 PM] Deciusmus
but I don't have any real notions about what is in #2

[6/13/2025 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i figured

[6/13/2025 12:29 PM] Deciusmus
I had a minor NPC from Addermarch who was pretty nervous about fey, compared to the Tyrwinghans

[6/13/2025 12:29 PM] Deciusmus
yes

[6/13/2025 12:30 PM] Deciusmus
I think it is useful if for "reasons" the newest part of Duskmire (i.e. around Cleenseau wood) is the "best"

[6/13/2025 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
with a rough sense of "better" as you go north, while also not requiring anything "bad" towards the south to be explicitly duskmire, as darkfall is also right on the border

[6/13/2025 12:31 PM] Deciusmus
also duskmire should stretch east as far as the Aveil hills and the river valley in Aveil, although it doesn't need to go as far east as Rinburg

[6/13/2025 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
right exactly

[6/13/2025 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
(at the same time part of the goal of developing #2 is to give a sensible reason for duskmire to expand west/north)

[6/13/2025 2:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so looking at the map - my sense is the "contested area" is really Addermarch, the Enst river valley, and maybe as far north as the Wistel, but the Semb valley and the highlands are something else potentially left undefined for now, but likely either solidly allied with Ethlenn and uncontested (Semb valley) or just outside the context of the Umbraeth / Ethlenn conflict (Highlands, which might have their own problems with Sharpspire)

[6/13/2025 2:35 PM] Deciusmus
yeah that makes sense

[6/13/2025 2:36 PM] Deciusmus
I'd like it to spread as far north as wistel, but I see the wistel as kinda the dividing line between "southern sembara" and "sembaran heartland" and I think the Gloomshaper influence should somewhat align with that, although it doesn't have to be perfect

[6/13/2025 2:37 PM] Deciusmus
but I think broadly from the Darkwood in the south to the Wistel in the north and from Aveil/Rinburg in the west to the sunset gate in the east is about correct

[6/13/2025 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
okay here is a rough idea. borders are not exact. (1) Lord Serenveil's territory is in gray, roughly along the eastern Enst valley. This is Nathaniel's patron and the fey lord behind the de Brune cult; aligned with Ethlenn and antagonist to Umbraeth, but may have own motivations. (2) Red hashes show active conflict between Serenveil and Umbraeth. (3) Green shows something else - not sure what the name is, but some very ancient fey entity, long predating Umbraeth and Duskmire, maybe a relic of the mythic age or something else weird. allied with no one; territory has shrunk considerably but still retains significant power in heart of ancient domain. barrier to Umbraeth's expansion. vibes are not yet clear but will likely be directly relevant to addermarch adventure. (4) Black arrows show incurisions from Darkfall across the Sunset Gate (5) Blue shows a second ally of Ethlenn, maybe a close ally/underling more directly kind of a splinter realm of Twilight's Grace. Questions: - Serenveil's territory could extent to the Wisford, or there could be an additonal minor lord on his northern border. Have no opinion here. - Aure valley is a little undefined, although the feywild along the Aure south of Adderfell is likely dangerous and an area of conflict between ancient green entity, Duskmire, blue Ethlenn ally, and Darkfall

[6/14/2025 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed addermarch fey politics in brainstorming fyi

[6/14/2025 2:21 PM] Deciusmus
a few thoughts... Aure River Valley - I think there is space for one or two other lords with a similar vibe to the blue area in here, perhaps one between green and Serenveil, and one between blue and Serenveil. (I am going to be running an adventure at some point where the PCs are basically fleeing through the fey wild from Duskmire and it would be useful if there was more than just Serenveil's realm)

[6/14/2025 2:22 PM] Deciusmus
also what if main part of Addermarch is something like "The Wilds", an untamed and raw part of the fey wild with no ruler

[6/14/2025 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
here is my slighty-more-fleshed-out Obsidian note (1) [[Lord Serenveil]]. An ally of [[Archfey Ethlenn]], although exactly how close an ally is not determined, and this may be more of a "joint enemies of [[Lord Umbraeth]] than anything else." Serenveil has his own interests in the Material Plane, and is the patron of a secret cult that involves many of the [[de Brunes]] and possibly others. The details of this cult are unknown but may eventually become relevant to the Addermarch campaign. In any case, Serenveil is through the 1710s and 1720s actively working against Umbraeth's expansion. Territory in gray, below; red cross-hatches show active conflict with Umbraeth. (2) [[Morlaith]], also known as Grymholt, the Briarheart, Keeper of the Thornweald, Lord of the Hidden Hollows. Morlaith is an ancient entity, a being perhaps predating even the arrival of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. Once controlled more territory, but has gradually shrunk to claim now mostly the hills and river valleys of western Addermarch. Morlaith is very explicitly not interested in the Ethlenn/Umbraeth conflict, and generally sees humans as insignificant, not worth even thinking about as they last only a blink of an eye. Vibe is very much the kind of "old world European" classic fairy tale. Morlaith is deeply dangerous, but not in the way Umbraeth for example is actively investing in messing with humans. Many of the ancient standing stones around Addermarch may warn of Morlaith. (3) [[Calanthe|Lady Calanthë]], Sentinel of the Setting Sun, is a close ally of [[Archfey Ethlenn]], who guards a realm congruent with the hills on the western border of Tyrwingha, in eastern Addermarch. Minimal details invented here.

[6/14/2025 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
i think "The Wilds" is kind of the vibe I am going for between Duskmire, green area, blue area, and Darkfall incursions

[6/14/2025 2:25 PM] Deciusmus
right

[6/14/2025 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
(and also to a lesser extent the green area itself / Morlaith, who would not be a "traditional" archfey)

[6/14/2025 2:26 PM] Deciusmus
I think having a close Ethlenn ally along the northern Aure makes sense.

[6/14/2025 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
just depends on how many "allies of Ethlenn" are worth inventing and making distinct

[6/14/2025 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
and/or between blue and serenveil

[6/14/2025 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but would be easy to put another Ethlenn ally between the green area and Serenveil, for example

[6/14/2025 2:27 PM] Deciusmus
And it is probably worth leaving some space for i.e. something undefined between Serenveil and Morlaith, and leaving the northern borders of Serenveil's domain indistinct

[6/14/2025 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
it is relevant that Serenveil and Morlaith don't border each other, but whether this is wilds, another fey realm, or conflict zone, etc, doesn't really matter

[6/14/2025 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
the fey adventure i'm writing is much more about Morlaith and "the Wilds" so the details of Ethlenn's allies are not so important

[6/14/2025 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a possible history where Ethlenn originally arrives and "makes the night safe" or some vibe like, carving her domain out of what was once a much larger Morlaith-controlled area. the vibe of Morlaith is very much shrunken ancient power who is still dangerous but clearly from an older time

[6/14/2025 2:31 PM] Deciusmus
right that all makes sense

[6/14/2025 2:33 PM] Deciusmus
When I get around to inventing the details for the adventure I'm going to run, it will be my PCs trying to get to safety (either Twighlight's Grace or one of the blue realsm) from Duskmire. So having some space to put stuff other than Serenveil + Morlaith is good, although it is possible the adventure might be mostly through Morlaith's realm, for example. They will be 9th or 10th level so something powerful is not necessarily a problem

[6/14/2025 2:34 PM] Deciusmus
If you are set in 1715 this is less relevant, but the major plot that might impact this is something like...

[6/14/2025 2:37 PM] Deciusmus
Part of Umbraeth's payment for this plan was magic to permanently open the fey gate in Cleenseau wood

[6/14/2025 2:37 PM] Deciusmus
Around 1716 Malach kills King Robert. At some point after this, but before October 1719, he makes a deal with Umbraeth. The original plan was that Malach will stir up some trouble on the southern border, and eventually find a way to ask Umbraeth for help defeating it. Umbraeth will pretend to be the savior of humanity, and will march up the Enst with his Duskhounds, fighting whatever bad thing Malach summoned, which Malach will force to flee to Tyrwingha. Tyrwingha will resist Umbraeth, of course, but Malach hopes enough Sembarans will see him as a savior to cause bloodshed between Sembara and Tyrwingha, and eventually civil war

[6/14/2025 2:38 PM] Deciusmus
By early 1720 this plan had fallen apart however

[6/14/2025 2:38 PM] Deciusmus
And the implication here would be that Umbraeth would likely be also making a strong push to conqueor Serenveil's domain, perhaps with Malach's help

[6/14/2025 2:40 PM] Deciusmus
And in part because Umbraeth was growing sincerely uncomfortable with all the undead

[6/14/2025 2:40 PM] Deciusmus
In part because whatever magic Malach used to summon the undead across the land had some negative impacts on Umbraeth's portals to Taelgar

[6/14/2025 2:41 PM] Deciusmus
So at some point in early 1720 there was a split and Umbraeth decided to stop working with Malach, and launched his plan to force the gate open by sacrificing someone connected to Ethlenn

[6/14/2025 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
right, i saw that somewhere in the notes although it is sometimes a bit hard to follow the plot

[6/14/2025 2:42 PM] Deciusmus
But his is still actively working against Serenveil. One of this allies in Aveil actually tried to kidnap and kill one of the de Brunes, who was rescued by my PCs

[6/14/2025 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
i think i am pretty set on 1715 though so all of this would be after addermarch

[6/14/2025 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
(but what that is is undetermined)

[6/14/2025 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the key points would be: - Serenveil is an enemy of Umbraeth more than an ally of Ethlenn, but works with Ethlenn, of course. there is likely to be some kind of connection/development between Serenveil and Morlaith in my game, at least in terms of Serenveil wanting information about Morlaith, so it is useful for there to be something that prevents easy travel in the Feywild from Serenveil's realm to Morlaith

[6/14/2025 2:46 PM] Deciusmus
Yes in 1715 it’s probably pre Malach entirely

[6/14/2025 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
- Morlaith is a barrier to everyone, and somehow keeps the fringes of their domain as the Wilds, so that none of Umbraeth, Serenveil, or Ethlenn's lieutenants can fully expand into Addermarch and end up being confined to the edges. This keeps the "Addermarian Feywild" with the kind of old-world fairy tale vibe I want and makes it a longstanding area of conflict and trouble, which works for both campaigns I think

[6/14/2025 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case none of this is likely to come up in my game tomorrow and i'll push a bunch of notes soon

[6/14/2025 3:02 PM] Deciusmus
One thing re: Umbraeth is he is very interested in access to taelgar and it should be the case that the areas he controls have few portals. If serenveil has a portal somewhere that might be a key motivating factor in their conflict
