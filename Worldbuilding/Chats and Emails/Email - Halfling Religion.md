I love this. The thing that immediately comes to mind is to retroactively write into the halfling firstborn the characteristic traits of halflings in the world today. So, something like: wanderer, trader, storyteller, music-maker, etc.

  

I'm thinking also that so much of Halfling identity is based around encounter with _other_. So, the wandering and the trading are outward-facing encounters with other communities and races and cultures. Storyteller and musician are inward-facing bearers of cultural history and identity -- which also sort of aligns to halfling language not being known by non-halflings.

  

I think halflings have this very expansive notion of family and hospitality. I think about, say, Bedouin hospitality traditions which are so deeply a part of the traditional culture, and (maybe) a function of being nomadic in a harsh world. That halflings would be the same with other halflings.  
  
That makes me think about halfling traditions of retribution or vengeance. When you're three feet tall and there's not a ton of you out there, what do you do when the town you stop in at murders your family? Is it a sense of hopelessness and powerlessness, or a commitment to nonviolence, or a notion of fate or history which is already in control, or that bad things just happen, or a sense of a generational vengeance and retribution, or a quiet dagger in the night. I sort of like the idea of roving halfling adventurers on the margins of halfling society which go around getting revenge on behalf of nonviolent halflings. I'm not sure how well that sits in the world or overall sense of halflings though.  
  
(this is all stream of consciousness brainstorm to see what sticks, incidentally)

  

Maybe two separate gods that are one, Janus-like, of, say, The Stranger and The Child -- some sense in which other-ness or outsider-ness and kinship or insider-ness are not separate from each other even though they are experienced differently. I'm thinking of the line attributed to John Gardiner that there are only two stories in the world: you go on a journey, or a stranger comes to town (which are the same story just experienced in different ways). Maybe the other gods have that sort of union of opposites. Like The Merchant and The Music Maker are both the same god -- that creativity/creation and commerce/finance are at some level of Halfling society both an expression of the same experience. 

  

That also makes me think about halflings and jazz! The notion of music as unique and improvised experience which expresses a universal form -- that the musical changes are the changes but the thing created over them is always unique -- would also mirror halfling understanding of selfhood: that each individual is both unique and, at the same time, merely an expression of an undifferentiated universal oversoul of halfling-ness.  
  
In all of this, I'm sort of preoccupied with the interplay between universals and particulars. The way permanent and unchanging things get expressed in unique and changing forms. It makes me think also of a wabi-sabi aesthetic, where an embrace of imperfection is more reflective of life-as-it-is than something artificially made to be perfect. That suggests that halfling shrines might be in natural places that somehow capture that experience. Some out of the way path off the trade road that they travel which leads, say, to a particular grove of trees, or ravine, or waterfall which captures that feeling. It might be interesting if those sorts of places existed where ley lines met, too.

  

In all of my thinking here, an assumption is that halflings _today_ reflect the way halflings have always been. That is, they were always wanderers and traders and storytellers and music makers -- that they didn't used to have a homeland that's now destroyed, that they weren't ever a majority culture, that they've always been nomads, always been everywhere. But is that your sense of it?  
  
Again, I'm all over the map here, but it's a delightful break in the middle of the day to pause and think about all this.

Tim :

Lots of great stuff here! I love the ideas about halflings and jazz - this was a connection present in my old notes from high school! 

  

The idea of building a lot of halfling lore around encounters with the other seems really perfect to me, especially given that halfling ideas of the other would seem very alien to us in some ways. When halflings meet other halflings, a stranger is just someone you haven't remembered yet, or someone you have forgotten. This feeds into the ideas about hospitality below, and expansive notions of family. 

  

Building on this, maybe three gods, each a Janus-like duality: The Stranger and the Child, the Merchant and the Music Maker, the Wanderer and the Storyteller. They would need names, and I think to halflings the duality would be part of the identity, so you wouldn't say a prayer to the Wanderer, but just to XXX, who is the Wanderer and Storyteller in one. So you have the home, the hearth, family represented by the duality of the inward-facing child and outward-facing stranger, the journey represented by the duality of the inward-facing storyteller and outward facing wanderer, and community, friendship, fellowship represented by the duality of the inward-facing music maker and the outward facing merchant. 

  

Although, this could be encapsulated in just one deity, perhaps the Stranger and the Child, or the Wanderer and the Storyteller (since both the journey and the memories of the journey are so central to halfling identity). So maybe it makes sense to just have one two-faced deity, perhaps also play with gender a bit by making the Wanderer/Stranger male and the Storyteller/Child female (or vice versa). Really like that Gardiner quote. 

  

And yes, the idea is that halflings have always been this way. Part of the conceit of Taelgar is that the Elder races (elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk, stoneborn) never change, their are not empires that grow and fall, new religions spreading and fading -- they are fixed in place by the permanence of their gods, for better or worse. 

  

On shrines - definitely like the idea that halfling shrines would be in the kind of natural places you describe, but also because halflings have this racial memory, I was playing around with the idea that particular _memories_ become like shrines. Over time, some memories fade, even in the racial consciousness, but others, those that capture this religious feeling, are experienced and re-experienced over and over again, and accumulate more memories to them, so you can not only experience the original memory, but the memory of a particularly famous storyteller experiencing the original memory for the first time. And then layered on top of that would be new memories that echo and reflect these memories. So you might have, say, the shrine to a calm day at sea, which isn't a place, or isn't just a place, but rather is a huge accumulation of memories and experiences. There would still be places -- say a high cliff overlooking a sheltered bay -- where the experience of this memory shrine might feel particularly strong. But also a lot of halfling religious practice would involve praying alongside and in the context of their racial memories, and priests in the halfling tradition would be closely associated with tradition keepers.

  

On vengeance and retribution - interesting ideas. I don't have strong feelings, although I have been kind of developing halflings as a bit of a protected group of sorts in modern-day Taelgar, at least, in the sense that it is more trouble than it is worth for most people to mess with them (and if a town finds out that you got into a fight and killed a halfling trader, you are likely to be punished quickly and harshly for the sake of the town). It is hard to get away with murder when the memories of the person you murdered don't end with their death. But I think they would try peaceful means, such as economic sanctions first, and most halflings would tend towards nonviolence personally, knowing that if shunning a town didn't get the offenders punished, vengeance would come sooner or later. I kind of imagine there is a bit of a quiet "I know how you've treated other halflings in the past" attitude to them, which they probably play up through myths and legends about great feats of telepathy and mind reading (even though the average halfling can't read minds and has limited range on their telepathy). But for problem cases, I can definitely see a bit of a roving band of halfing adventurers taking things into their own hands. Certainly halflings are not perceived by the world as entirely peaceful and safe - after all, they will drag caravans of exotic goods across terran few others would dare to venture (although part of this is the fact that Wellby's let's just try it and see attitude is pretty common among halflings). 

  

Really enjoying kicking these ideas around!
