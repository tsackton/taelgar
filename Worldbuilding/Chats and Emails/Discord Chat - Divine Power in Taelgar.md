looking at your comments on divine power in taelgar, perhaps easier to move to discord. i think the point about classification of magic into arcane/divine/primal is not so much about specific D&D classes, but about where on this spectrum things fall:
(a) fey have clerics and divine magic works for fey similarly to humans; someone making a "fey cleric" character could reasonably be expected to think a little bit about what divine entity grants them power
(b) fey have clerics that metaphysically / in-world access magic from the [[Plane of Creation]], but not necessarily via the Material-Plane-Centric "divine powers grant miracles", suggesting an alternate route for diivine magic to manifest
(c) fey don't have clerics. any player that wants to play a fey cleric would be assumed to be using the cleric mechanics to represent some other kind of in-world magic, and would be expected NOT to have a connection to a particular god

or, put another way, do fey, in-world, pray to gods; pray in some strange fey way; or don't pray at all in any sense

I think it’s b or c
Although I’m not sure that it is impossible for fey to pray to a god
rsulfuratus — Today at 7:55 PM
right, i mean i think we've established pretty clearly that all kinds of things are possible and that at least some gods are not picky about who they get prayers from and grant prayers to
but i guess that is different from "there is fey religion"
Deciusmus — Today at 7:56 PM
Right. I think the vibe of any inner plane creature praying to a god seems … non standard
rsulfuratus — Today at 7:57 PM
the original "children of the divine" logic actually got around this nicely by making fey/elementals/giants/dragons have a direct connection to the divine presence.
Deciusmus — Today at 7:59 PM
Right. Why does that have to be wrong though?
I mean I’m not sure if elementals have a soul on the plane of souls necessarily but if they don’t they should have some  equivalent

i kind of like the vibe that none of the speculation about the plane of souls in the in-world note is correct, but the hint from the fey idea of the dreamworld being the "real" plane of souls and the plane of souls being the echo ties into your suggestion as well
Deciusmus — Today at 8:02 PM
I also like the vibe that none of them are precisely correct
I also like the idea of preserving unique possibilities and contingencies rather than having a complete typology or everything is exactly in a neat box
But one question that seems relevant - did the riving create the plane of souls and the [[Land of the Dead]]? What was cosmology like before the riving?
rsulfuratus — Today at 8:05 PM
it isn't clear to me at the moment
the original concept of the riving pre-dates the invention of the [[Plane of Creation]] as a nexus for the Divine Presence
so in that pre-[[Plane of Creation]] cosmology, the riving was effectively all the inner planes mixed together
and dominated by arcane magical energy
the riving creates the Firstborn, pulls apart the inner planes, but it was never really resolved how the [[Land of the Dead]] / plane of souls / spiritual realms come into existence
i think i'm coming around to the idea that the plane of souls possibly always existed, and maybe the riving stretches the plane of souls into the astral plane and perhaps even creates the [[Plane of Creation]] as a home/embodiment of the divine presence, behind the wall of the [[Land of the Dead]]
so that would imply the riving creates the [[Land of the Dead]], but not the plane of souls which predates it
(more in a bit if you are around, have to get Nathaniel to finish his homework)

(Was cleaning but done)
(So back)
I think the metaphysics might work better if we assume that at least the plane of souls existed forever.
Deciusmus — Today at 8:29 PM
That sets up this idea that whatever creation process existed during the riving the great wyrms and whatnot existed on the plane of souls. How that fragmented during the riving is canonically unclear but ultimately it means a fundamental divide between children of the riving - who get soul stuff “directly” - and  after the riving - who get it from gods
rsulfuratus — Today at 8:34 PM
Yeah I think that makes sense. Want to let it sit a little but am going to update [[Land of the Dead]] tonight and will copy this discussion and update the open questions
Deciusmus — Today at 8:36 PM
There is a whole idea that could be explored about how the actual source of divine magic is [[Soulstuff]] not anything else
So the only creatures that don't have access to divine magic are those that do not have [[Soulstuff]]
for most "normal" species, their own "personal" soul stuff is not strong enough to generate magical effects
but of course, what is ki powers except kenzo using the power of his soul on the plane of souls to generate magical effects?
rsulfuratus — Today at 8:42 PM
Yeah. Actually this could tie back into hkar - maybe part of the magic of hkar was kind of an upwelling of [[Soulstuff]] somehow, so that personal [[Soulstuff]] was enough for magic. At least in the early days
Maybe the whole thing with the void mind is it cannot create [[Soulstuff]], it can only try to shape [[Soulstuff]] that escapes from the divine presence
Hence the desire to conquer Hkar, and the need to destroy it
Could also tie into undead, and why turn undead works, and why you cant have undead clerics but you can have undead mages
