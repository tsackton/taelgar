working out some elven generational dynamics. lmk what you think. basic assumptions are from the demographics spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rMp9eP617CMDdkDgmDRPpOOUbO0TjTY17578DK2wPwo/edit#gid=838085721). assume that most elves survive to 800-900, but many choose to leave the world between 950 - 1150, so basic demographic structure then sets up 7 ka as the "current population", with anyone born more than 7 ka ago clearly a rare elder.

to put it in 1749 dynamics, you have:
37th ka (born in 1627 +/-), currently the youngest generation, and currently in their wandering/pre-parent phase
36th ka (born in 1467 +/-), the Great War generation, but also the current parental generation, probably sharing most responsibility for community management and governance with the 35th ka
35th ka (born in 1307 +/-), the 'grandparent' generation, probably the main pillar of elven society
34th ka (born in 1147 +/-), the youngest of the 'elder' generations, probably not yet leaving in great numbers,
33th ka (born in 987 +/-), the elders
32nd ka (born in 827 +/-), the oldest of the elder generations
31st ka (born in 667 +/-), the leaving generation, in the midst of departures, rapidly declining in numbers
30th ka and older (born before 507 +/-), the remaining generation, those who decided not to leave the world for whatever reason, small in number and hard to find


[10/30/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
basically you have, at any one time, one generation of "children", two generations of "adults", and three generations of "elders", and then the "post-elders" whatever, but the 7th ka in the past (31st in 1749) would be transitional between elders and "post-elders"


[10/30/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
at one point i thought you had sketched out some idea about transitions in responsbility among the ka but I can't find any notes at the moment


[10/30/2023 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
I had a sketch in email that was basically 3 roles:

The "nurturer", who watches over the young and the homeland
The "caretaker", who watches over the elder races (essentially in charge of foreign policy)
The "unifier", who mediates disputes


[10/30/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
and then an alternating pattern on which generation takes which role


[10/30/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
let me see if I can find what I wrote


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
ah I found it


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
It was in email, too big to paste here


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
in your "Dawn of Everything" worldbuilding phase


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
ha, yeah


[10/30/2023 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not wedded to that exact structure for elves, but I do like the idea of rotating leadership based on generations.


[10/30/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah mostly I am trying to figure out who in Orenlas would remember Drankor


[10/30/2023 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
i think from a game perspective it is better if these people are not a dime a dozen, seems weird that there would be mystery about history if most elves can remember 1000 years ago clearly


[10/30/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
I like the basic idea that you have nuturer / caretaker roles that alternate, but it might actually work better to speed up the "die off" of the oldest generations a bit


[10/30/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure most elves remember 1000 years ago clearly

[10/30/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
Also


[10/30/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
basically I want to set up a distinction between the bulk of elvish society that are in the wanderer / caretaker / nuturer phase and the elders who are beginning to think about leaving to happen around 3-4 generations in the phase


[10/30/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
*past


[10/30/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
but I think that works with your alternating scheme


[10/30/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I think basically they scheme I had no major role for anyone beyond current-2


[10/30/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
So the 34th ka and earlier, are the "elders" in current time


[10/30/2023 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
Also, consider that outside of the "caretaker" phase many elves might not pay that much attention to human history. And I really don't think elves necessarily remember everything clearly either. 

You can even  imagine a sort of intentional forgetting, as part of aging and the changing of the generations, where the focus of a specific elf changes


[10/30/2023 9:51 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[10/30/2023 9:52 AM] .deciusmus
I definitely agree that very old elves are rare, but I think there is probably a fair number of moderately old elves, i.e. who were alive during the Drankorian empire, but who just made no effort to remember that. They've been in the Feywild for 300 years, or whatever, and the mortal world isn't really a concern


[10/30/2023 9:52 AM] rsulfuratus
many very old elves for example may take on a ritual role (like unifiers in your email) and as part of that begin to shed their sense of their earlier life


[10/30/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
I like both an explicit magical/ritual change and also just normal forgetfulness


[10/30/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think this gets at what I wanted, there is kind of a transition around 3-4 ka ago from "normal old person" to "elder" that has very distinct and elven flavor


[10/30/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
some of that is just about forgetting, some about leaving to other planes, some about magic/ritual, etc, but it gives a flavor/transition point that is ~500-600 years ago


[10/30/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
have a meeting now but am going to sketch this out in a bit more detail later today



[11/19/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
do you have any ideas about what the divine realm of Aldanor might be like? i thought we had some brief discussions about this at some point but can't find them now


[11/19/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
oh, wait, found this email

The domain of Aldanor and Elmerca is at first glance, an ancient forest at twilight, with bright stars twinkling above and secluded pools of still water reflecting the sky. But all is not as it seems. The forest is not a traditional forest, where the trees grow straight up from the ground, and where water flows downhill, and where the sky is always above. Instead, it is more a set of forest vignettes, connected by pathways of thought, dream, and magic. A visitor might arrive in a small glade, with ancient trees towering overhead and silver flowers blooming in the moonlight on the forest floor. But walking out of the glade, they might find themselves standing on criss-crossed branches hundreds of feet across, part of the canopy of an unimaginably large tree, looking down at a river of bright stars sparkling like a field of diamonds. Walking around a branch, the visitor might find it narrowing, and narrowing, until they find themselves in the leaves of an ancient oak grove, surrounded by cliffs that go up forever, but growing out of nothing but a field of stars below. Climbing to the base of one of the oaks, the visitor might notice the field of stars becomes, as they pass the edge of the grove,  swaying bridge of twisted vines and moss and delicate orchids with hundreds of complex petals, leading over a gorge between two huge cliffs, with a misty bottom a thousand feet below, and trees growing up out of the bottom of the gorge and stretching into the sky full of stars.

Navigation is a challenge, as the place is partly memory and dream, and so navigation is not really by sight or touch, but by memory and recollection. Some pathways are lit up with magical beacons, and those with eyes to see the magic and the right memories can navigate more easily, although only between some of the major landmarks: the Cascade of Living Stars, the Wind Scar, the First Wilds, the Canopy of the Eldest, others unnamable and unreported. [No specific ideas on what these places are, just tossing out names]

The plane is permeated deeply by a sense of age and ancientness -- there are no new growths, no saplings, no green shoots or new plants. Even the blooming flowers, mosses, vines and other small plants are permeated with a sense of age. There are exceptions though: the first is the stars - they often appear bright-new as if they were created moments ago. These stars often appear as if they are just within arms reach, although rarely does one who reaches for them find they really are within arms reach. It is said that the stars are the thoughts of Elmerca, and each continues a true foretelling of some future event. But it is also said that they are dangerous, and burn with a fierce cold and razor-sharp edges. The other exception is magic: out of the ancient trees magical creations regularly 'bloom'. This magic usually upsets the normal order of time: ephemeral things in the material plane are long-lived, and permanent things ephemeral: sparkling fireworks that last for days, or years; small wisps of energy shaped like squirrels, or birds, that dash across the woods and vanish into a tree the next moment; embodied notes of songs, that drift through the realm with a soft hint of music, and gather in flocks where the soft hints crescendo into orchestral triumphs; silver-flecked granite boulders, that last just long enough to serve as a stepping stone over a stream, and then scattering into a flurry of glittering silver; salty raindrops, like tears, the slowly drift down (or up) from the sky carrying pervasive sense of melancholy.


[11/19/2024 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
In general I like that. One thought is is there 1 domain or 2? do the various elder races typically have a single divine realm?


[11/19/2024 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
Also I wonder if there should be some type of sense of connection to the mela / leya connection. Is there a tide or sense in Aldanor's realm of the mela/leya? Does it originate there somehow?
