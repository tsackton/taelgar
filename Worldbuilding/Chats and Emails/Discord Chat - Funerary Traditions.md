My players are constantly asking about what people do with bodies, esp in the face of necromancy, so I was looking to finalize the ‚Äúhuman funerary traditions‚Äù stuff I wrote a while ago. There‚Äôs a doc in brainstorming I‚Äôm mildly rewriting, do you think anything is very wrong there?


[1/27/2024 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
there is a lot there and i'm not convinced all of really needs to be canonical, but also don't think any of it is necessarily very wrong.

on the topic of necromancy, i think there is an important distinction between mindless corporeal undead (skeletons, zombies) which don't affect the soul at all, and things like ghosts, specters, wraiths which represent a trapped soul unable to reach the [[land of the dead]].

plenty of people would see the former as a violation and evil, and I would imagine that cremation and/or burial on sacred ground would be commonly seen as a way to prevent that. 

the latter has nothing really to do with the treatment of the body, as least not metaphysically


[1/27/2024 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
i think the one comment / change i'd make about the brainstorming doc is i'm not sure that Mos Numena needs to have a general, culture-wide preference for burial over cremation


[1/27/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
I wasn‚Äôt too worried about the Chardon/dunmar/Mawar parts, but was working up the sembaran bits to publish basically


[1/27/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
I was going to leave Chardon/dunmar/Mawar in brainstorming


[1/27/2024 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
right, just saying I don't think Sembaran burial tradition (which does need to exist as a strong preference for burying bodies instead of cremation for your plot to work) necessarily should be presented as a twist on the universal Mos Numena preference for embalming


[1/27/2024 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. Chardon may very well tend to cremate the dead


[1/27/2024 10:39 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, agreed


[1/27/2024 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
there is a lot of lore developed here just to set up a backstory conflict for Wazir that i'm not sure needs to be canon


[1/27/2024 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôll push something new soon.
The basic idea is that Drankor had a ‚Äú10 days of mourning‚Äù around the body/guidance through the land of the dead


[1/27/2024 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
But with undefined ideas of what happens to the body after that


[1/27/2024 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
Kestavo tradition is strongly tied to the idea of burial in a sacred space to make the kestavo more easily able to find the soul


[1/27/2024 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
In sembara, this persists as a cultural preference for burial


[1/27/2024 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
right, but i think without the theological argument for burial based on resurrection of the body, combined with the risk of zombies, you need some pretty strong constraints to have burial be a stable preference


[1/27/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
actually one could imagine that in 1750 Sembara cremation is preferred, specifically because of the zombie uprisings in 1720


[1/27/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
even the Kestavo tradition it is unclear why the body needs to be buried intact as opposed to cremated first, although it would be easy to come up with metaphysical arguments here


[1/27/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
i think I would actually work from this:
- in Drankor / early Mos Numena, you have the 10 day preparation of the body, where the soul is seen as tranisitioning and still needs the link to the material plane, but after 10 days you have a variety of cultural preferences not driven strongly by religion or metaphysics, left undetermined. Drankor was powerful enough magically that perhaps the risk of undead was just not seen as something serious 
- the kestavo have a strong tradition of place-based religion, and the idea that the kestavo needs to find the body. burial in places the kestavo watch is assumed to prevent necromancy. you get the place-based burial ideas, and perhaps cremation is seen as risky, since without the locus of the body, maybe the kestavo can't find the soul. ghosts might be seen as coming from people who died in particularly tragic ways that destroy the body. whether this is exactly true doesn't really matter.
- sembara just mixes these, slotting in mos numena temples for kestavo sacred spaces, and probably just adopting the lore that a) temple grounds prevent undead, and b) destroying the body risks the soul being lost


[1/27/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess this is probably pretty consistent with what is there already, only skimmed quickly


[1/27/2024 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
This is actually where my players are going, to encourage everyone to cremate bodies


[1/27/2024 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
And actually, so far in game, the zombies have been focused on coming from the forgotten dead, i.e. out of the woods, from battlefields, etc


[1/27/2024 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
Which would be consistent with burial in a churchyard actually providing some real protection from necromancy


[1/27/2024 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that is probably at least partially correct


[1/27/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
On this, I think the kestavo tradition is something like:
- the focus is on burial immediately, because the kestavo aid the transition **to** the land of the dead, as well as guide people through it, and if they can't find the soul, it is in danger of being a lost ghost in taelgar
- burning before burial makes it harder for the kestavo to find the soul - the body provides a locus that gets lost in cremation, to connect the kestavo (who lives in a place) with the soul


[1/27/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
So there is a fairly strong tradition around burial, although it could be that outside of the kestavo burial is not a popular tradition in Taelgar. The kestavo are fairly unique in being (a) small gods and (b) of a specific place


[1/27/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I'm imaging that burial falls out of favor during the tradition to pantheonic religions on Hkar after the northerners leave but before the mariner exodus


[1/27/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
so burial traditions in Taelgar in the current day are largely in cultures influenced by northern folk religions


[1/27/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
I think that kestavan tradition persists in Sembara, with specific Mos Numena god of a place taking the place of the kestavo, and the temple taking the place of sacred place, but the preference might be more cultural than anything else, and for example, in cities might have already disappeared for space reasons. Maybe burial is seen as a countryside tradition in Sembara, mostly


[1/27/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
Sure this works, but it could also be a fairly unique-to-the-kestavo thing


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
well, so far only two northern cultures well developed are Deno'qai and Kestavo. Deno'qai definitely seem more like cremation types


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
you burn the body with the offerings to the tanshi to take up the soul


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Kestavo obviously burial types


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right. What I'm saying is that the Hkaran tradition is probably unimportant


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, fair


[1/27/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
It could well be that cremation was always the tradition on Hkar and burial specifically developed with the kestavo around gods of a specific place


[1/27/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Or whatever, I think it doesn't really matter


[1/27/2024 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i was just thinking if you wanted to preserve a burial conflict in Wazir's backstory it would make sense for the Mawar to also have a burial-based tradition derived from the influence of the old (now extinct) northern culture


[1/27/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, sure


[1/27/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
I forgot about Wazir's backstory


[1/27/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure it really matters because it never came up, although if you all ever go looking for Kaeso, Wazir might resurface


[1/27/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
or if we ever play Mawar again


[1/27/2024 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
for sembaran doesn't matter at all and of course it can be left undetermined where exactly the kestavo burial tradition came from


[1/27/2024 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right. At some point I want to write up Wazir's story, but I'm not attached to the conflict being specifically around burial per se. The important point for the character was just that it was around something to do with the death of one of his kids. It could be funerary traditions themselves, not burial. Or what tokens you cremate the body with


[1/27/2024 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
Or inheritance or what you do after death or whatever. Lots of options there.


[1/27/2024 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, of course


[1/27/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
I think I like the Sembaran tradition being somewhat mixed, and probably the idea of cremation being fairly common south of Sembara - Maseau, Adderfell, etc.

And in the cities (Embry, etc) cremation is also a lot more popular, or mass burial in religiously blessed crypts


[1/27/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the urbanized parts of the Drankorian Empire definitely would have been on the cremation side of things


[1/27/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
So Chardon and Cymea would definitely have strong traditions of cremation, not burial


[1/27/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
This matters btw for the amount of zombies Apolloyon has access to üòÑ


[1/27/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
I expect it to be very few, because all the Drankorians were fans of cremation üòÑ


[1/27/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
well, no one went into Drankor and burned all the bodies of the people who died in the plague


[1/27/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
true enough


[1/27/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
that's why Kharsan was Grash's base - lots of people died in the plague and were never cremated. also why the order of the awakened soul cared so much about finding the lost dead


[1/27/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I might make Isingue have an unusual tradition around death, derived from the magic water


[1/27/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, that would make sense


[1/27/2024 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
which might also give the Isinguese community something to be cohesive about that sets them apart from Sembara generally


[1/27/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that's a good idea


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
Although what would the unusual tradition be? I'm introducing some Isinguese to my game soon, so it might come up, although I doubt the specifics will (unless I want to make some kind of conflict where the Isinguese are uncomfortable with mass cremations or something)


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
it could be something like a strong burial tradition that is specifically isinguese and derives from the idea that souls nourish the land or something.


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
but you need the body to decay naturally


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
I like that at first thought


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so cremation isn't bad for the soul, they wouldn't mind exactly, but it is kind of wasteful


[1/27/2024 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps in reality this is in part how the magic waters actually worked in some way


[1/27/2024 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think that's great. So in Greater Sembara, you could have 3 main influences:

* a kestavan traditional of burial very focused around the initial period of travel both to and through the Land of the Dead but with much less concern for the body after that period
* an Isinguese traditional of burial more tied to the idea of natural decay, and the idea that is a spirtual benefit to letting the body return to the soil (which feels very ranger-y as well)
* a Drankorian tradition of cremation after the 10 days of "laying in state" so to speak


[1/27/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
In the north and west of Sembara, which was more influenced by the kestavo, the kestavan tradition has resulted in a culture of temple burial + crypts/mass graves, after the ritual period of mourning
In the more coastal and urban parts of Sembara, cremation is the norm, after the ritual period of mourning


[1/27/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
Maseau is probably more influenced by the Isinguese tradition, as would Aurbez


[1/27/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess I just mean the Isinguese in those places probably maintain the traditions more strongly


[1/27/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
In Tyrwingha, I'm not sure what the story would be. How does a lot of fey around influence things?


[1/27/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the fey probably don't really interact much with human burial traditions. the fey have a very different relationship with death than humans, their souls don't necessarily pass on to some divine realm. it is probably more like reincarnation, with the extent to which a particular fey is still "themselves" dependent on lots of complicated factors


[1/27/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
but e.g. if you kill an archfey on the material plane, it isn't like they die


[1/27/2024 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I was going to say the same. Having a strong fey-influence in the culture probably has little impact on burial


[1/27/2024 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
and a fey that was banished from the feywild might just have their soul utterly destroyed if they die


[1/27/2024 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
(this is theoretically in part why Agata when to such elaborate lengths with the ring of the warded mind and the whole deception around that)


[1/27/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
Although Tyrwingha might have a greater sense of a second life in the feywild as a possibility, instead of death (or at least, as a way to prolong life)


[1/27/2024 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, in terms of escaping death / cheating death / prolonging life the presence of the fey would be a big factor. but once you die, doesn't really matter


[1/27/2024 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
Unless there is a sense of possibility, i.e. I could imagine a young widow in Tyrwingha feeling that cremation is more final, because then she can't make a bargain with a fey to bring her husband back, or whatever.


[1/27/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
sure. i think also Tyrwingha is less influenced by Drankorian culture overall, so you might still have kestavan ideas lingering even without a real kestavo presence


[1/27/2024 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
in the modern day it doesn't share much culturally with the Zimka after 1000 years of cultural divergence but something like burial traditions can persist a long time without something to shake it up


[1/27/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/27/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
And during the Drankorian period, the Tyrwinghans were probably distinguishing themselves via something


[1/27/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
*from Drankor, I mean


[1/27/2024 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
one of the things that history of humanity book I read talked about a lot is that how a lot of cultural traits that persist are defined in opposition to something else. So you could imagine the Tyrwinghan culture hangs on to burial as a well of keeping their identity separate from the Drankorians, even though they end up adapting the Drankorian religion basically because Ethlenn asks them to


[1/27/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/27/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
also, there is probably a sense in which the gods aren't super prescriptive every specific ritual practice


[1/27/2024 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
Right, exactly


[1/27/2024 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
So the *gods* don't seem to care what you do, it is more a cultural thing


[1/27/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
especially Mos Numena which have a very kind of archetypal vibe. The Traveler is never going to send you a dream telling you how to bury your parents.


[1/27/2024 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/27/2024 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
whereas e.g. the various small god traditions might care a lot more where the kestavo are basically like we can't help you unless we are close to the body


[1/27/2024 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/27/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a initial doc: Human Funerary Traditions. Marked status/tim


[1/27/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
I will push something about kestavo + sembaran later, plus a bit of cleanup in the brainstorming doc


[1/27/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
planning on sharing with my players later this week, so let me know if ou have changes you want me to make when you get a chance
