on a totally separate topic, I'm thinking of putting the neo-easterner religion in Usk / northern Green Sea


[12/26/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
possibly Irrla as well, tbd


[12/26/2023 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
Is Ursk the right place for an interesting religion on top of all the mage stuff?


[12/26/2023 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I guess we explicitly left out religion when doing the Artem backstory to make it easy to add in later whatever seemed right


[12/26/2023 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
And its a good place to introduce it in game.


[12/26/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so things will be more complicated than I'm letting on


[12/26/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but the basic idea is that it would be useful for the people of the northern Green Sea coast - east of Skaerhem all the way to the Eastern Isles - to be culturally distinct from western/southern green sea


[12/26/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
basically trying to figure out the cultural strands of the green sea


[12/26/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
you have:
- "east northerners" that become the highland cultures of Sembara and Vostok


[12/26/2023 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
- "ancient mariners" that are Skaer


[12/26/2023 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
- "east southerners" that become Medju / mariner trade pensisula with undetermined religion but which has some cultural connections to each other and are outward-looking / trade oriented


[12/26/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
that leaves basically only Irrla and the north coast


[12/26/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
(this is excluding drankorian-influenced areas in Cymea / South Cymea / Western Gulf; and Dunmari-influenced areas in South Cymea)


[12/26/2023 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
both irrla and north coast are relatively not seafaring


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
so probably should have a fairly significant cultural break with the Hkaran mariner culture


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
Did you look throughthe old emails from last summer about mariner trade peninsula?


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
I thought there was some good stuff there, and I think we were leaning towards the "divine spark" religion as north coast/Irrla


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/26/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the ^^ is basically a summary of those discussions


[12/26/2023 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right.


[12/26/2023 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
I'd add that the above shouldn't imply that the eastern isles themselves (which are quite large) are not another cultural strain TBD


[12/26/2023 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right, eastern isles themselves are strange and unique and potentially dominated by non-humans anyway


[12/26/2023 3:51 PM] .deciusmus
I liked this idea for the MTP itself:
The overriding attitude of MTP religion though is one that says: love your gods for if you do, they will watch over you. And there is also a strong sense of: the more love you give, the more love you have to give. This very strongly encourages adopting lots of additional gods. I am imaging the most religious folks having rosary bead style chains of symbols of many different gods and ships decorated with totems to many different gods, the more the better.


[12/26/2023 3:52 PM] .deciusmus
which doesn't really impact putting divine spark up in Ursk/Irrla


[12/26/2023 3:52 PM] .deciusmus
(plus this
The divine spark religion doesnâ€™t actually contribute gods to this mix, but it does contribute a meditative tradition that the MTP people see as a way to get closer to the gods, and so there is a unusual semi-Buddhist style self-awareness / meditation philosophy that floats around. This leads to some folks say chanting a sutra to twelve different gods to strengthen their connection to them.)


[12/26/2023 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, there is a lot of good stuff about MTP there but not my current focus, at least not until you do the cursed demon waters sidequest


[12/26/2023 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
the things that are currently not clear in my mind are:
- is Irrla culturally related to Ursk/north coast or is it a distinct thing? 
- how big of a cultural break is the Skaer / Vostok Mountains?
- how long has Ursk been settled? Is the isolation a relatively new thing or does this go back 1000 years?


[12/26/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, yes, I think that all makes sense especially the "northern" route - basically a big split between the Vos (east northerns), Skaer (ancient mariner), and Ursk/Irrla/NorthCoast, which themselves are quite distinct from the "east southerns" who end up being the basis of MTP/Medju


[12/26/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
My instinct is that irrla is distinct


[12/26/2023 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is my instinct too


[12/26/2023 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
although that could theoretically still leave the possibility of Irrla as a part of the divine spark culture if there was an early split between Ursk/north coast and Irrla w/i the divine spark tradition. e.g. could have a indian/japanese buddhist kind of thing


[12/26/2023 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[12/26/2023 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
As far as Ursk, the old Artem backstory thread had a lot of good ideas


[12/26/2023 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it was pretty marginal land until the various Urskian magical rituals were developed


[12/26/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Also the Artem backstory had the novja which we had theorized were a different cultural strain


[12/26/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
oh yes, that is going to come back


[12/26/2023 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it works best if Ursk has grown a lot in the last 300-500 years, since the various magical rituals were established, but that without those rituals it is a pretty marginal land and never had large population


[12/26/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps there are two strains of divine spark people on Irrla and scattered along the northern green sea coast, and for whatever reason the north green sea coast folk turn away from large-scale seafaring


[12/26/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
and, if not exactly isolationist, have low population densities, no big cities, and weird dangerous crap like vampires and dragons to deal with, so they develop a low-key culture based around low population denisties


[12/26/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
depending on your plans, this culture could become the novja, or the novja could be a more Vostok/northern group heading east


[12/26/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
But I think Skaer is a big cultural break. I think the Ursk culture is not particularly similar to Skaer/Vostok at all


[12/26/2023 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, okay. still a few moving pieces I'm trying to decide what the most fun would be


[12/26/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, the novja could be culturally related to Skaer


[12/26/2023 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
if the novja are a vostok / northern group, that potentially sets up a religious conflict with kestavo vs divine spark


[12/26/2023 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
or, you have a divine spark vs magocracy


[12/26/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
conceptually I kind of feel like either could work but from pure worldbuilding logic it is probably more likely to have north coast settlers as divine spark and then magocracy grow out of that, rather than the novja be vos-related


[12/26/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
kestavo vs divine spark seems like it would be an odd set to be in conflict


[12/26/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess you could have these sense that the divine spark tradition is *usurping* the kestavo


[12/26/2023 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think it is more:
the Vostok mountains are a serious barrier to travel, so you have basically wilds on the other side, and you get the divine spark religion out of which a magocracy grows, setting up a cultural conflict between the "old magocracy" and the novja

vs

the various highlander cultures spread across the entire interior Taiga, and blend in various ways, producing the Sembaran highlands, the Vos, and the ancestors of the novja with some degree of cultural continunity; then, as the magocracy develops on the coast they conquer the inland


[12/26/2023 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
in the current day the vostok mountains and the interior (even the coast) east of Skaerhem is very inhospitable but that could be relatively recent


[12/26/2023 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
the Artem backstory kind of implied #2 but with the origin of the novja undetermined, that doesn't mean the implication has to be true


[12/26/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it could swing either way, it just depends:
is the magocracy conquering a very distinct culture (vos/highlander) or a relatively related culture (novja/divine spark who lived inland instead of on the coast)


[12/26/2023 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
I like the novja being distinct, personally.


[12/26/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don't have strong feelings


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
And small differences can loom large, ultimately, so the "you are half foreign" vibe of the novja could happen even if the cultural difference isn't huge to being with


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think the novja should feel different now


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
no matter what


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
question is just 500 years ago, how different were they?


[12/26/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I kinda of  like the idea of this band of northern-small-gods people spreading almost from coast to coast across the taiga and northern forests of Taelgar


[12/26/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
And then the mariners come into the picture but on the north coast, really hug the coast, with these small scattered coastal villages. For a thousand years they might not even know that there were people way to the north, especially if the rivers are cold, frozen some of the time, and hard to navigate


[12/26/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
So you end up with two low population density groups, a divine spark group who left the mariner traditions behind and live in small groups along the coast, and a (probably semi-nomadic) vos/kestavo/northern culture farther north in the forests


[12/26/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps there is a more urbanized divine spark group on Irrla, who develop in their own unique way


[12/26/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
but that can be undetermined


[12/26/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
Then, the magocracy arises, say 500 years ago, and urbanizes and the population grows (a lot) amongst (some section?) of the divine spark people


[12/26/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
and then post-Great War they conquer the northern people


[12/26/2023 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm. yeah, this could work. will ponder a bit


[12/26/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
But honestly, a single divine spark culture could work as well. Why does one group go north though?


[12/26/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
The land seems marginal-ish and it isn't clear why you wouldn't end up with dense(r) coastal settlement


[12/26/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in that case, the idea would be that you have relatively uniform low-density settlement at first. development of rituals allows bigger cities to be protected, and you get something like an 'urban / rural' split


[12/26/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
for a while these cultures just develop in peace separate from each other


[12/26/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
then something changes after the great war, prompting urban culture to expand


[12/26/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
this could be whatever drives expansion in the northerner scenario as well


[12/26/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I can see how that work would, but I kinda like the small-gods-northern-band as a unifying factor across taelgar
