on sembaran land ownership - I think the vibe feels right in general. specific comments mostly on non-humans


[1/5/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
One comment on Dunmar, btw: what are the borders, exactly? Is there some set of land that is considered "dunmar" by the gods?


[1/5/2024 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
my feeling is probably not


[1/5/2024 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
the "the gods own the land" is more of a cultural/religious aspect of dunmari culture than the gods actually owning the land


[1/5/2024 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
although i do have a bunch of old, dubiously canonical notes about the gods specifically bringing the dunmari to this place for a particular purpose


[1/5/2024 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
or perhaps it goes the other way, the longer the dunmari occupy a place, the more the gods grow to inhabit it


[1/5/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
I like the vibe of the dunmari being more a people than a place, per se.


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
That is, Dunmar doesn't really have formal borders or political organization, it is the membership in a temple and the relationship of the temple to the Samraat that matters, not where you live


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that is definitely true


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
So I think the political organization in the note could clarify that a bit more


[1/5/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I also kind of like the idea that the reason it is Shakun - after all, a rather minor diety - is responsible for the defense of the eastern border from all kinds of bad things is specifically because unlike the five siblings, she was born to a Dunmari and had a physical connection to the land


[1/5/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway on land holdings:


[1/5/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
1. dwarves I think would certainly own land, but probably never not outright (and even taxes might be complicated). dwarves would very likely outlive the lord of the manor, and there could theoretically be dwarven communities that have passed down land for longer than Sembara has existed


[1/5/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure exactly how this would play out and it probably isn't formalized in the way that relationships with lizardfolk and halflings are


[1/5/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but it doesn't seem very dwarvish for a dwarf to consider themselves a "peasant"


[1/5/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think maybe that's just a poor choice of words in my doc


[1/5/2024 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think freehold land is particularly "subserviant"


[1/5/2024 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
well yes, even putting aside the subserviant aspect


[1/5/2024 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno, if the dwarf buys Sembaran land, why would they be against paying taxes onit?


[1/5/2024 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
Or why wouldn't a dwarven smith by willing to lease some land from a lord, or whoever, because they didn't intended to stay for more than 30-50 years, so a 50 year lease seemed better than outright buying the land?


[1/5/2024 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think they would be against paying taxes on it - or even, necessarily, leasing it. i'm thinking about the opposite arrangement though, where the dwarves are already there and perhaps have been there for a while, and the land is now claimed as crownland or whatever


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
RIght, in those cases I just think the land would have never been claimed as crownland


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
Its folkland


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, sure, okay, that makes sense


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
I actually envision the legal arrangements in some places as being quite complex


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so you might have little bits of folkland on a manorial estate that was in some dwarven family since before barony of X even exists


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, exactly


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Now, the dwarves might sell it, in which case it becomes crownland


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
You can't really sell folkland outside of your "folk"


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
so in this case, to non-dwarves


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
By the dwarves could sublease it, or whatever


[1/5/2024 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, I think that works. dwarves are basically fine with debts and obligations and would generalyl fit in the system, although I think could be a lot of odd quirks (e.g. a dwarf might offer a very large sum instead of annual taxes in order to turn a piece of crownland back into folkland, for some  reason)


[1/5/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, that's basically the same idea as the lizardfolk. You are negoiating with the duke or king or queen


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the only think I would change about lizardfolk is that there is probably room for a range of attitudes here


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
all lizardfolk consider their land folkland


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but some lizardfolk might consider much of lowland sembara as "lizardfolk land"


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
since historically (long ago) it was


[1/5/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
so there may be times when lizardfolk just settle without asking for permission and dare the local lord to do something about it


[1/5/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
this doesn't have to be common but I don't think relationships between sembarans and lizardfolk need to be 100% peaceful all the time


[1/5/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
true. I'm just not sure I want to set up Sembara in the role of colonizer taking the indigenous land


[1/5/2024 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
fair, although it is pretty different since the humans were there long ago too, and the lizardfolk weren't driven out by the humans


[1/5/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Right, just if it comes up in an actual game I'd want it to be more differentiated and less coded as "hey this was our land, we are taking it back"


[1/5/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I wouldn't play it as that. I don't think the lizardfolk would view sembaran settlements as occupying stolen land - it is more a question of rents on profits


[1/5/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
and whether it is formally sensible to lay claim to unsettled, unimproved land


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps (some) lizardfolk understand unimproved, unsettled land as simply empty and free to be claimed by anyone willing to work it


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
the sembarans who settled and built cities are doing exactly what they should - settle and grow and the land is yours


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
it is only the idea of a lord saying "this land is mine by right of whatever" *without* settling it or working it


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
Right, in fact, the ancient idea of folkland matches that exactly and could even have come (at least in part) from the lizardfolk


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
of course going back to earlier conversations about lizardfolk they might have very different ideas of what improving land means


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think the vibe is still right regardless of details - the basic idea is the land supports you and you support it, and that is what gives you property rights


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
not the fact that you marched an army through two years ago


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
(Some) lizardfolk then just reject all the "overlord/sovereign" stuff


[1/5/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps other lizardfolk see the building walls and maintaining borders as "improving" the land in a way that gives the crown control


[1/5/2024 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
It could just play almost as a disagreement about scope. Is maintaining a road through a wilderness an improvement to all of that empty land?


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
and I think it is more interesting if there are a range of opinions and disagreements among the lizardfolk

[1/5/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
now, halflings are more complicated


[1/5/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
Ultimately almost all of the "new" crownland outside of the ancient duchies either came about via 
* a slow process of accretion as (human) families died out, or sold land, and various tracts and bits and pieces came under the control of the crown
* major depopulation events were reversed by armies, and the crown claimed all the land they freed from the hobgoblins/whatever


[1/5/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I really don't think halflings would give a hoot about some human lord. if a halfling family wants to settle down and run an inn on the road between fellburn and rinburg, they aren't going to negotiate with some lord


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
they are going to build an inn, and run it. or negotiate with someone who owns an inn, and take it over


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
the whole concept that someone can "own" land feels very un-halfling


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that said, they probably feel fine about paying taxes


[1/5/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
but also probably have their own opinions about what taxes are fair


[1/5/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Do you envision halflings as just kinda like ignoring local law?


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, almost completely


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Presumably they aren't going to just decide this piece of farmland looks nice so I'm just going to take it over


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
It seems hard to be a member of society in a fixed location and ignore the laws


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
well, they have their own laws


[1/5/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example you can't just take stuff would be enforced at the halfling end of things not the human end of things, so to speak


[1/5/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Why would humans put up with that though?


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
I guess if it works and doesn't really cause problems


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
well usually halflings are pretty well behaved, and they are quick to punish their own troublemakers


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
But why would the human lords of the land tolerate a halfling effectively just stealing their land?


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I don't really imagine halflings wanted to build a home in the middle of nowhere


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
people tolerate it because it doesn't always end up as "stealing"


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
If you are building an inn just outside the walls of Rinburg, what, they just do it even though someone owns that land?


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that is the "you can't just take land"


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I'd imagine it like this. say a halfling family wants to start an inn outside Rinburg


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a nice orchard near the river, just along the road, that seems perfect.


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
the set up camp in the orchard, and let it be known that they want to stay


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
and then they wait


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
probably they don't build anything for a year, but they have a little market


[1/5/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
presumably at some point -- relatively soon, unless it is owned by an absentee landlord or something -- whoever owns the orchard (if they aren't the person working it every day) shows up


[1/5/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the halflings ask if they can build an inn, and what the person wants


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
if they can't come to an agreement, they move on. maybe they come back in a generation and see if the new owners are more amenable


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but most people agree pretty quickly, because the halflings remember strange things. you don't want your kids cursing you out for refusing a good offer


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
and sometimes what the halflings offer is way more than what the land is worth


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but isn't that in fact "negoitating with some lord"?


[1/5/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess I was more thinking about chains of obligations


[1/5/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
But land really doesn't have a chain of obligations


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
well, you owe tax to someone


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, but most taxes are only on argicultural produce


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
An inn doesn't owe property tax


[1/5/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
and halflings, for example, might not always agree on who owns land. if you are a peasant who has a 50 year lease, the halfings might decide you own the land, not the lord


[1/5/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but it gets dicey for the person with the 50 year lease


[1/5/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
sure. although there are probably plenty of stories (true or false) of halflings who gave some peasant a comparatively huge some of money for land they didn't technically own, and then the peasant just skipped town


[1/5/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and left the halflings to deal with the lord


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right, and the retribution would fall on the peasant not the haflings ,ultimately, because the lord doesn't want to piss off the halflings


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
that is why they skip town


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
But sometimes they are caught anyway


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
of course. basically the idea is the haflings don't really interact with the formal system of land registeries and deeds


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
And othertimes the halflings are forced to leave, although that probably doesn't end well for the lord


[1/5/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don't have a good sense of halflings view of collective punishment


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point schwartz and discussed this and were leaning towards the idea that halflings have a very strong sense of familial justice - so if your great great grandparent cheated their great great grandparent you are in trouble


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
Right I more meant if a lord pushes the halflings out, do they punish everyone who lives in the manor?


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
Or just the lords family


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
no, just the lords family


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
But they might not always have a good mechanism to do that


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
right, which is why sometimes the halflings get pushed out


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
Also, it doesn't strike me as obvious that the halfling would decide that the yearly lease-fee is meaningless, i.e. would they actually want to ruin some small scale landholder?


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
I guess maybe sometimes they do


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
and other times they don't


[1/5/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
halflings are supposed to feel kind of chaotic


[1/5/2024 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
sometimes they. might double the yearly lease fee the previous owner was paying for no clear reason apparent to the landholder


[1/5/2024 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
What is a halfling view on contracts?


[1/5/2024 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I think their view is roughly something like my present self cannot compel an obligation from my future self to your future self\


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
of course this can't be taken to the extreme or you couldn't even buy something from them


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think generally most people would be wary of long term contracts with halflings


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. you'd never make a 50 year lease with a halfling imagining it would be kept


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
you'd make a series of 1 year leases


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
But I think from the perspective of Sembaran land holding, it boils down to 
(a) a halfling would consider the land theirs as long as they had purchased it fairly and they were still using it
(b) halflings don't always agree with the Sembaran legal system as to who the owner is or what theterms of purchase "should be"


[1/5/2024 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
right, and if they acquire a freehold, and would normally owe a manorial tax, they might also not agree with the lord on what the manorial tax should be - they would view this as a negotiation where the amount owed might include 0, instead of something the lord gets to decide


[1/5/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
Well...


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't refactored the taxes part, but I think for the most part the manorial taxes are a percetage of the harvest


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
If you build an inn, nothing is due


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but then doesn't the growth of a city just cost money? unless the lord is getting it back in other taxes


[1/5/2024 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
I have a separate taxes document that basically has 3 main taxes:

the deca and nonem, which are 1/10 and 1/9 of the harvest (so collectively, 19% of the harvest), due on argicultural produce
the hearth tax, due from every building with a hearth


[1/5/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, sure, then halflings might pay the hearth tax but consider it a negiotiation to set a fair rate


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Then, additionally, there is a baronial tax, owed by the baron to the crown or duke, for which the baron has to collect money


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Often via market taxes, taxes on inns, poll taxes (i.e. tax per person), bridge/road taxes, etc


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
But I kinda assume halflings would generally pay these, if they saw them as fair taxes for the stuff they are gettig (.e. use of a road)


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so this is a bit separate from landowning per se but the general view of halflings would not be "we don't pay those taxes" it would be "we offer you what is fair and negotiate"


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
And it probably comes out in the wash, i.e. the one time the baron gets stiffed, but some other time a halfling caravan pays 10x as much


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
So mostly who is going to complain


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that people should see halflings a bit like a lottery ticket but with fair odds


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
and then human pyschology takes over and the stories of winning circulate in a way that the stories of losing don't


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
Right the other bit is mandatory gifts, i.e. the lord of manor might expect gifts from everyone on the birth of the heir


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
but of course, this would also apply might more gently to halflings


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea of a mandatory gift would probably be seen as quite offensive by halflings


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
No one "demands" the halflings pay the gift, the lord lets it be known this has happened, and hopes for the best


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
Right but the idea of giving the lord a present on the birth of the heir, if the lord has been a huge boon to the local halfling community would not be weird at all


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
And might also be quite substantial


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
no, of course not, it could be vastly more than what you would expect


[1/5/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
this all plays into the lottery idea. if you keep the hallings that pass through your land happy and safe, then when your heir is born maybe you'll get something truly huge


[1/5/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
The only other source of money I have that would be very offensive to halflings is the idea of local monopolies


[1/5/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
and the story about how the lord of such-place's son got a dozen horses for a wedding gift from some halflings he'd never even met before travels far and wide (probably in part helped by halflings themselves)

{Reactions}
üëç

[1/5/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah halflings would just basically ignore those


[1/5/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
Probably one of the few things that would cause true conflict; if some lord's main source of incoming is the local monopoly on brewing, and a hafling decides to open a brewery/inn in the same town, the lord might not really have any good options


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but of course the halflings would know this, and although they should feel chaotic it isn't totally capricious


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
But I suspect that is quite rare, as these types of monopolies are usually on stuff like milling, brewing, bakehouses, etc not say "selling glassware"


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right. But that's how they punish the grandson of the lord who didn't let them build an inn without punishing the whole town


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
So to the poor grandson, maybe it really does seem capricious because he doesn't know that his grandfather refused a halfling deal


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
But that all works well, I think


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
it is caprcious to the humans but not the halflings


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
I think dwarves and local monopolies is more interesting; what I have in my notes is that the dwarves are given permission to ignore the local monopoly as long as they don't sell to humans. To me, that seems reasonable, but not sure your thoughts


[1/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i think dwarves are the most likely of any non-human race to have substantial "dwarven quarters" in human cities and towns


[1/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
so that does have a certain logic


[1/5/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i think depending on the size of the local dwarven community you'd have a variety of arrangements, but that feels like a plausible option


[1/5/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right. It isn't one size fits all on the Sembaran side either, a lot depends on the specific baron and duchy and lord


[1/5/2024 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i also think it is worth keeping in mind a little rare species like elves, centaurs, stoneborn, various fey, etc. they are rare enough that this is mostly going to be kind of one-off arrangements


[1/5/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
which would mostly exist outside of typical human rules and understanding


[1/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think there are no "general rules" outside of lizardfolk/halflings/dwarves.


[1/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
And even for halflings there are probably no laws, more folklore and word of mouth about how to best deal with them


[1/5/2024 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yes
