This is a raw dump of 1/18/2025 - 7/28/2025

I think probably Haines vs Sitka boils down to: Haines: better for land animals & eagles; best option if people explicitly want flightseeing; slightly simpler arrival logistics; more time on water (Lynn Canal cruise); potentially somewhat more scenic Sitka: better for marine animals and seabirds; best option if anyone cares about Tglit culture; easier internal logistics, also best option if anyone is hoping to explicitly avoid small planes



**Deciusmus**

just putting some stuff in a word doc

I think we'd have to split up - the planes don't fit 10 people and neither of the two companies appears to operate multiple planes - but we could book one 6 person and one 4 person plane from each of the two companies, or, if not everyone wanted to do the flightseeing part, split up with some people doing flightseeing and others going straight via air taxi.

1:57 PM

I emailed the two flightseeing companies in Haines about air taxi stuff



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 9:42 PM EDT

i was looking at haines a bit more and if we aren't doing a bear fly out from juneau (probably not worth the money given timing), it might be appealing as it gives seems like it gives us best land mammal options (although none nearly as likely as whales)

9:41 PM

if haines air service not feasible for logistcs/capacity/price, i think no choice to make. if haines air service feasible, we can send both options and discuss with group

9:40 PM

yeah Laura okay with flights. i agree those seem the best.



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 9:39 PM EDT

If Laura is okay with the flights I think either Sitka Juneau Glacier Bay Or Juneau Haines Glacier Bay Are probably the two best options - dependent on Haines air service being something we are willing to pay



**Deciusmus**

8:42 PM

One upside to Haines is there are moose there although far from guaranteed



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 8:28 PM EDT

maybe though you should contact the mountain flying service and just see if it would be feasible. if that doesn't work then it is not worth further exploration

8:27 PM

the lynn canal ferry seems cool but i'm not convinced haines has as much to do that matches our interests

8:26 PM

the biggest downside to haines is that while it has a lot of good hiking and kayaking, it does not have good whale watching or glaciers



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 8:25 PM EDT

Yeah I saw that



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 8:25 PM EDT

this place has regularly scheduled air taxi between Haines and Gustavus and would be easy to combine with flightseeing. [https://mountainflyingservice.com/southeast-alaska-air-taxi-services](https://mountainflyingservice.com/southeast-alaska-air-taxi-services "https://mountainflyingservice.com/southeast-alaska-air-taxi-services")

8:24 PM

yeah haines is the most likely option to be able to get haines -> glacier bay on a small plane



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 8:23 PM EDT

On a different topic, I am not convinced Juneau - Haines - Glacier Bay is impossible - if we want to do flight seeing in particular I bet we could organize Haines to Glacier Bay. It would probably just be in 2 planes



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 8:22 PM EDT

she could theoretically fly bos->sit on fri, there is a 7 am alaska air flight that connects to the sea->sit flight

8:22 PM

i don't have a strong feeling, and i don't think M&T do, so just should check with laura to see if it matters to her



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 8:21 PM EDT

Although I guess we could do Saturday-Sat with a post-trip instead

8:21 PM

We could make Sat-Sat work but not if we ended in Glacier Bay



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 8:20 PM EDT

it doesn't really matter to us that much, just we would do the seattle stuff after if we do fri-fri, and before if we do sat-sat

8:20 PM

right



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 8:19 PM EDT

It’s actually better for us to be fri-fri because if we are going away for close to 2 weeks we’d want to be home no later than Sat late afternoon

8:17 PM

Ie if we did San Fran for 2 nights it’s easy to get a flight SFO-SEA-SIT on Fri



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 8:17 PM EDT

we could also shift to Sat-Sat instead of Fri-Fri, that would make it easier for us to do a pre-trip instead of post-trip, and might be simpler



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 8:17 PM EDT

So plenty of flexibility on the arrival side.

8:16 PM

Right. I think we are probably going to do some sort of pre-trip - either 6 nights (Sat-Thur) or 2 nights (Wed-Thur)



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 8:15 PM EDT

also works with GST -> JNU -> SIT, actually, we'd just go straight from SIT to San Juan islands on Sat (spend Fri night in SIT)

8:13 PM

that is likely easiest, adds only one day off at cost of having to deal with working day after we get home

8:12 PM

but i was tentatively thinking after if we do the SIT -> JNU -> GST. we'd spend Fri night at an airport hotel, rent car AM Sat, spend Sat night in San Juan Islands, spent Sun night in Sea and see Kate's friend, fly home Mon

8:11 PM

and i haven't looked at logistics yet and whether it is manageable with 2 nights in SEA or whether we need 3 and how it connects to the Alaska flights

8:11 PM

not sure whether before or after is easier. kate and i haven't discussed



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 8:10 PM EDT

Or skip it? Or are you not sure

8:09 PM

Would you do San Juan after or before?



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 8:08 PM EDT

right



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 8:08 PM EDT

Yeah although we might rather spend Fri in Sea and go home at a reasonable time on Sat then get home 12:05am



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 8:07 PM EDT

Laura is unclear, haven't talked to her

8:07 PM

I talked to Mama and Tob and they were planning at least one night in SEA on both ends to avoid 12+ hour travel days so they are flexible

8:06 PM

(and anyone who didn't want a long travel day (M&T) could take the 1:40 to Seattle on Sat and fly Seattle - Bos on Sun)

8:05 PM

alternatively could just add a night in Sitka and fly home 7 am on Saturday instead of 7 am Friday, and do 2 - 3 - 3

8:04 PM

so it is a trade off. you get a bit of extra time in Juneau, since you have 3 full days plus an evening, instead of 2 1/2 days, but you get 1 day in Sitka instead of 2 1/2 days

8:03 PM

you can but you have to take the 7 am flight from Sitka. so you really only have 1 day in Sitka then



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 8:01 PM EDT

The only advantage of the reverse is you can go Sitka - Seattle - Boston in one day



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 8:00 PM EDT

but it does work in reverse

8:00 PM

7:08 pm is a nice flight, gives you all day in Sitka then early dinner and transfer to Juneau (or late dinner in Juneau). JNU -> SIT at 10:15 pm just means a bit of a late night

8:00 PM

(2) the flight times JNU->SIT aren't quite as good as the reverse. SIT -> JNU (45 min) at 6 am and 7:08 pm JNU -> SIT (45 min) at 9:20 am or 10:15 pm

7:58 PM

(1) cruises are never in Sitka on Sat, so nice to be there over a Sat, which only works if we go there first

7:58 PM

two minor downsides to the reverse:



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 7:55 PM EDT

Wait ignore that last one

7:54 PM

This could work - what’s the upside versus the reverse though? Ie glacier bay first - if everyone was on west coast anyway. Or alternatively do Jun-GB-Sitka?



**Deciusmus**

07/27/2025 at 5:30 PM EDT

Leaving now will look when I get home

5:30 PM

Yeah playing D&D



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 4:49 PM EDT

You can actually fit in the Glacier Bay boat tour on the last Friday, it gets back in time to connect to the flight to Juneau. So could do three whale watches (Sitka, Juneau, Gustavus); two kayaks (Sitka; Glacier Bay); two tidewater glacier cruises (Juneau; Gustavus) and still have a day and half in Sitka, a day in Juneau, and a half-day in Glacier Bay free for hiking / other things

4:46 PM

I think you are playing D&D today but what do you think of this: Fri: 11:20 am SEA -> Sitka, land 12:53 pm. Night Sitka. Sat: All day Sitka. Night Sitka. Sun: All day Sitka. Fly Sitka -> Juneau (dep: 7 pm, arr: 8 pm). Night Juneau. Mon: All day Juneau. Tues: All day Juneau. Wed: Morning/afternoon Juneau. Fly Juneau to Glacier Bay (dep: 4 pm, arr: 4:40 pm). Night Glacier Bay. Thurs: All day Glacier Bay. Fri: Morning/afternoon Glacier Bay. Fly Glacier Bay to Juneau (dep: 5:35, land: 6:10 pm), then Juneau to SEA (dep: 6:55 pm, land 10:15 pm). Only 737s so don't have to worry about air taxi cost (for multi-plane charters) or ferry schedules or other issues with small planes not being able to fit us all. Biggest downside is it is a much nicer itinerary if you can spend a night in Seattle on either end. I'm not sure how that fits into your plans



**rsulfuratus**

07/27/2025 at 9:42 AM EDT

so it is really tough to figure out a way to do hiking, boat tour, kayak, and whale watch from glacier bay w/o 3 nights there

9:42 AM

but still get in too late for a kayak (and landing at 4:30 pm local / 8:30 pm Boston after long day probably don't want to do anything too strenous)

9:41 AM

it is actually easier to arrive glacier bay direct from boston than arrive sitka direct from boston, so could start glacier bay

9:38 AM

the real annoyance is juneau -> glacier bay because if you are limited to scheduled non-seaplane service you either take the AA jet flight which lands too late to do kayaking on arrival day, or you need to time the ferry

9:36 AM

(august 2025 since june 2026 not out yet)

9:36 AM

the logistics are actually quite tricky. i looked at a bunch of air taxi and sea plane service for august and all the scheduled service i could find caps at 9 people

9:34 AM

mostly working on dnd but poked around a bit at alaska logistics here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SDqwcpT4_Lb9R5BLT8UBFKjK8ee0VaJEO7tfq70UbR4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SDqwcpT4_Lb9R5BLT8UBFKjK8ee0VaJEO7tfq70UbR4/edit?usp=sharing "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SDqwcpT4_Lb9R5BLT8UBFKjK8ee0VaJEO7tfq70UbR4/edit?usp=sharing")



**Deciusmus**

06/14/2025 at 3:02 PM EDT

One thing re: Umbraeth is he is very interested in access to taelgar and it should be the case that the areas he controls have few portals. If serenveil has a portal somewhere that might be a key motivating factor in their conflict



**rsulfuratus**

06/14/2025 at 2:53 PM EDT

in any case none of this is likely to come up in my game tomorrow and i'll push a bunch of notes soon

2:48 PM

- Morlaith is a barrier to everyone, and somehow keeps the fringes of their domain as the Wilds, so that none of Umbraeth, Serenveil, or Ethlenn's lieutenants can fully expand into Addermarch and end up being confined to the edges. This keeps the "Addermarian Feywild" with the kind of old-world fairy tale vibe I want and makes it a longstanding area of conflict and trouble, which works for both campaigns I think

2:46 PM

(but what that is is undetermined)

2:46 PM

i think the key points would be: - Serenveil is an enemy of Umbraeth more than an ally of Ethlenn, but works with Ethlenn, of course. there is likely to be some kind of connection/development between Serenveil and Morlaith in my game, at least in terms of Serenveil wanting information about Morlaith, so it is useful for there to be something that prevents easy travel in the Feywild from Serenveil's realm to Morlaith



**Deciusmus**

06/14/2025 at 2:46 PM EDT

Yes in 1715 it’s probably pre Malach entirely



**rsulfuratus**

06/14/2025 at 2:43 PM EDT

i think i am pretty set on 1715 though so all of this would be after addermarch

2:42 PM

right, i saw that somewhere in the notes although it is sometimes a bit hard to follow the plot



**Deciusmus**

06/14/2025 at 2:42 PM EDT

But his is still actively working against Serenveil. One of this allies in Aveil actually tried to kidnap and kill one of the de Brunes, who was rescued by my PCs

2:41 PM

So at some point in early 1720 there was a split and Umbraeth decided to stop working with Malach, and launched his plan to force the gate open by sacrificing someone connected to Ethlenn

2:40 PM

And in part because Umbraeth was growing sincerely uncomfortable with all the undead

2:40 PM

In part because whatever magic Malach used to summon the undead across the land had some negative impacts on Umbraeth's portals to Taelgar

2:38 PM

By early 1720 this plan had fallen apart however

2:38 PM

And the implication here would be that Umbraeth would likely be also making a strong push to conqueor Serenveil's domain, perhaps with Malach's help

2:37 PM

Part of Umbraeth's payment for this plan was magic to permanently open the fey gate in Cleenseau wood

2:37 PM

Around 1716 Malach kills King Robert. At some point after this, but before October 1719, he makes a deal with Umbraeth. The original plan was that Malach will stir up some trouble on the southern border, and eventually find a way to ask Umbraeth for help defeating it. Umbraeth will pretend to be the savior of humanity, and will march up the Enst with his Duskhounds, fighting whatever bad thing Malach summoned, which Malach will force to flee to Tyrwingha. Tyrwingha will resist Umbraeth, of course, but Malach hopes enough Sembarans will see him as a savior to cause bloodshed between Sembara and Tyrwingha, and eventually civil war

2:34 PM

If you are set in 1715 this is less relevant, but the major plot that might impact this is something like...

2:33 PM

When I get around to inventing the details for the adventure I'm going to run, it will be my PCs trying to get to safety (either Twighlight's Grace or one of the blue realsm) from Duskmire. So having some space to put stuff other than Serenveil + Morlaith is good, although it is possible the adventure might be mostly through Morlaith's realm, for example. They will be 9th or 10th level so something powerful is not necessarily a problem

2:31 PM

right that all makes sense



**rsulfuratus**

06/14/2025 at 2:30 PM EDT

there is a possible history where Ethlenn originally arrives and "makes the night safe" or some vibe like, carving her domain out of what was once a much larger Morlaith-controlled area. the vibe of Morlaith is very much shrunken ancient power who is still dangerous but clearly from an older time

2:28 PM

it is relevant that Serenveil and Morlaith don't border each other, but whether this is wilds, another fey realm, or conflict zone, etc, doesn't really matter

2:28 PM

the fey adventure i'm writing is much more about Morlaith and "the Wilds" so the details of Ethlenn's allies are not so important



**Deciusmus**

06/14/2025 at 2:27 PM EDT

And it is probably worth leaving some space for i.e. something undefined between Serenveil and Morlaith, and leaving the northern borders of Serenveil's domain indistinct

2:26 PM

I think having a close Ethlenn ally along the northern Aure makes sense.



**rsulfuratus**

06/14/2025 at 2:26 PM EDT

just depends on how many "allies of Ethlenn" are worth inventing and making distinct

2:26 PM

and/or between blue and serenveil

2:26 PM

but would be easy to put another Ethlenn ally between the green area and Serenveil, for example



**Deciusmus**

06/14/2025 at 2:25 PM EDT

right



**rsulfuratus**

06/14/2025 at 2:25 PM EDT

(and also to a lesser extent the green area itself / Morlaith, who would not be a "traditional" archfey)

2:24 PM

i think "The Wilds" is kind of the vibe I am going for between Duskmire, green area, blue area, and Darkfall incursions

2:23 PM

here is my slighty-more-fleshed-out Obsidian note (1) [[Lord Serenveil]]. An ally of [[Archfey Ethlenn]], although exactly how close an ally is not determined, and this may be more of a "joint enemies of [[Lord Umbraeth]] than anything else." Serenveil has his own interests in the Material Plane, and is the patron of a secret cult that involves many of the [[de Brunes]] and possibly others. The details of this cult are unknown but may eventually become relevant to the Addermarch campaign. In any case, Serenveil is through the 1710s and 1720s actively working against Umbraeth's expansion. Territory in gray, below; red cross-hatches show active conflict with Umbraeth. (2) [[Morlaith]], also known as Grymholt, the Briarheart, Keeper of the Thornweald, Lord of the Hidden Hollows. Morlaith is an ancient entity, a being perhaps predating even the arrival of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. Once controlled more territory, but has gradually shrunk to claim now mostly the hills and river valleys of western Addermarch. Morlaith is very explicitly not interested in the Ethlenn/Umbraeth conflict, and generally sees humans as insignificant, not worth even thinking about as they last only a blink of an eye. Vibe is very much the kind of "old world European" classic fairy tale. Morlaith is deeply dangerous, but not in the way Umbraeth for example is actively investing in messing with humans. Many of the ancient standing stones around Addermarch may warn of Morlaith. (3) [[Calanthe|Lady Calanthë]], Sentinel of the Setting Sun, is a close ally of [[Archfey Ethlenn]], who guards a realm congruent with the hills on the western border of Tyrwingha, in eastern Addermarch. Minimal details invented here.



**Deciusmus**

06/14/2025 at 2:22 PM EDT

also what if main part of Addermarch is something like "The Wilds", an untamed and raw part of the fey wild with no ruler

2:21 PM

a few thoughts... Aure River Valley - I think there is space for one or two other lords with a similar vibe to the blue area in here, perhaps one between green and Serenveil, and one between blue and Serenveil. (I am going to be running an adventure at some point where the PCs are basically fleeing through the fey wild from Duskmire and it would be useful if there was more than just Serenveil's realm)



**rsulfuratus**

06/14/2025 at 10:43 AM EDT

pushed addermarch fey politics in brainstorming fyi



**rsulfuratus**

06/13/2025 at 3:03 PM EDT

okay here is a rough idea. borders are not exact. (1) Lord Serenveil's territory is in gray, roughly along the eastern Enst valley. This is Nathaniel's patron and the fey lord behind the de Brune cult; aligned with Ethlenn and antagonist to Umbraeth, but may have own motivations. (2) Red hashes show active conflict between Serenveil and Umbraeth. (3) Green shows something else - not sure what the name is, but some very ancient fey entity, long predating Umbraeth and Duskmire, maybe a relic of the mythic age or something else weird. allied with no one; territory has shrunk considerably but still retains significant power in heart of ancient domain. barrier to Umbraeth's expansion. vibes are not yet clear but will likely be directly relevant to addermarch adventure. (4) Black arrows show incurisions from Darkfall across the Sunset Gate (5) Blue shows a second ally of Ethlenn, maybe a close ally/underling more directly kind of a splinter realm of Twilight's Grace. Questions: - Serenveil's territory could extent to the Wisford, or there could be an additonal minor lord on his northern border. Have no opinion here. - Aure valley is a little undefined, although the feywild along the Aure south of Adderfell is likely dangerous and an area of conflict between ancient green entity, Duskmire, blue Ethlenn ally, and Darkfall

**Deciusmus**

06/13/2025 at 2:37 PM EDT

but I think broadly from the Darkwood in the south to the Wistel in the north and from Aveil/Rinburg in the west to the sunset gate in the east is about correct

2:36 PM

I'd like it to spread as far north as wistel, but I see the wistel as kinda the dividing line between "southern sembara" and "sembaran heartland" and I think the Gloomshaper influence should somewhat align with that, although it doesn't have to be perfect

2:35 PM

yeah that makes sense



**rsulfuratus**

06/13/2025 at 2:08 PM EDT

so looking at the map - my sense is the "contested area" is really Addermarch, the Enst river valley, and maybe as far north as the Wistel, but the Semb valley and the highlands are something else potentially left undefined for now, but likely either solidly allied with Ethlenn and uncontested (Semb valley) or just outside the context of the Umbraeth / Ethlenn conflict (Highlands, which might have their own problems with Sharpspire)



**Deciusmus**

06/13/2025 at 12:31 PM EDT

also duskmire should stretch east as far as the Aveil hills and the river valley in Aveil, although it doesn't need to go as far east as Rinburg



**rsulfuratus**

06/13/2025 at 12:31 PM EDT

right exactly

12:31 PM

(at the same time part of the goal of developing #2 is to give a sensible reason for duskmire to expand west/north)



**Deciusmus**

06/13/2025 at 12:30 PM EDT

I think it is useful if for "reasons" the newest part of Duskmire (i.e. around Cleenseau wood) is the "best"



**rsulfuratus**

06/13/2025 at 12:30 PM EDT

with a rough sense of "better" as you go north, while also not requiring anything "bad" towards the south to be explicitly duskmire, as darkfall is also right on the border



**Deciusmus**

06/13/2025 at 12:29 PM EDT

I had a minor NPC from Addermarch who was pretty nervous about fey, compared to the Tyrwinghans

12:29 PM

yes



**rsulfuratus**

06/13/2025 at 12:28 PM EDT

the main vibe i want to maintain is that addermarch feels very distinct from tyrwingha. while tyrwingha is protected by ethlenn, addermarch is explicitly contested, so you never know if the fey you encounter is "good" or "bad", using those terms very loosely



**Deciusmus**

06/13/2025 at 12:28 PM EDT

I haven't introduced anything other than a few hints about the "minor lords" type "buffer zone"

12:28 PM

but I don't have any real notions about what is in #2



**rsulfuratus**

06/13/2025 at 12:28 PM EDT

yeah i figured



**Deciusmus**

06/13/2025 at 12:27 PM EDT

I'm pretty swamped between now and Africa



**rsulfuratus**

06/13/2025 at 12:27 PM EDT

i have meetings from 1-3 but otherwise a pretty light day

12:27 PM

i am currently writing the next addermarch adventure which is going to involve a minor fey incursion, so i may try to work out some of the details of #2 a bit

12:23 PM

but that is likely more of a worldbuilding thing to plan, and less something that is likely to be reshaped in play

12:23 PM

the only complication is that Nathaniel's backstory does tie to some of the minor fey realms in #2

12:22 PM

i don't expect this will likely get to particularly high levels and is mostly built around the possibility that we could just end the campaign after any adventure

12:21 PM

yeah, i am leaning that way



**Deciusmus**

06/13/2025 at 12:20 PM EDT

Kinda think 1715 for addermarch is pretty good. Your campaign feels not that likely to create some regional-impacting event

12:18 PM

And also that anything my PCs do to shake up things unexpectedly doesn’t cause issues

12:17 PM

Just before Clee has the advantage that the outcome of #1 doesn’t matter.

12:16 PM

2) PCs are likely going to stop this and end up needing to escape from Duskmire, likely via the poorly defined #2 on your map 3) at some point I expect they will go on an adventure in Feywild to find more info about Greymalkin’s origin and get him his wings back

12:15 PM

Basically I have two big plot things coming up- 1) The Gloomshaper is going to attempt to kidnap Elaine II (Queen of Sembara post Lich) and use her connection to Ethlenn to permanently open the portal to Cleenseau

12:13 PM

So in general I’m happy to commit to better sharing/notes. We have had some scheduling issues and slow role play focused sessions so plot is a little behind. I think setting Addermarch a little bit before Cleenseau is easier than a little bit after although I’m not sure.



**rsulfuratus**

06/13/2025 at 11:26 AM EDT

on a related topic, here is my feywild map. (1) Twilight's Grace (2) undefined, needs work (3) Duskmire + extensions (4) Darkfall (5) Hollowdark (6) Amberglow (7) Shimmersong (8) Sharpspire (9) Everlight's Bloom (10) Emberwine red line is Sunset Gate east of Darkfall and south of Hollowdark are also undefined. east of Darkfall overlaps Orenlas and should be allied with Twilight's Grace; south of Hollowdark less clear, I had some rough idea of a land of peaceful dreams or something like that

guessing you are too busy at work and with trip prep to think about taelgar much, but in case not: i am working on the next adventure for my addermarch campaign, and it is likely to impinge on the feywild a bit, which is leading me to finally try to anchor this in time. contemplating two main options, which have different implications. option 1 is roughly contemporaneous with your cleenseau game, probably either a few years before (e.g., around 1715) or a few years after (e.g. around 1725). this potentially allows a fair bit of reuse of material between games, but requires a bit of coordination to keep the timeline untangled, especially concerning feywild politics (although i will likely focus more on Hollowdark / Darkfall than Duskmire) option 2 is around 1740, say 5-10 years before the dunmar campaign begins. this makes it a bit more challenging to reuse material as it puts it about a generation after your game, but simplifies the coordination problems to a certain extent as the cleenseau events are then just "history" and easier to leave in the background do you have any opinions?



**rsulfuratus**

06/01/2025 at 1:15 PM EDT

fwiw, i think my feywild arc notes are more or less completely incorporated. many are still behind secret blocks and i didn't really have the energy to figure out if there are any actual secrets remaining but easy enough to do if there are specific pages you are drawing from for developing any upcoming feywild stuff in your campaign that pulls from this (especially Harrow/Wend stuff - never figured out the exact map but Hollowdark and/or Darkfall are more or less immediately south of Twilight's Grace

final update on campaigns. while not everything is filled out, basic organization now puts dunmar, cleenseau, addermarch, great library, mawar, plus canon one shots (oskar + riswynn, western cymea low level) in campaigns. all of these also have at least a PC directory, although some dont have anything there yet. ausson's crossing and great war get PC directories, but not campaign directories, as the details of the story is not necessarily canon ausson's crossing, great war, and stone titan get directories in worldbuilding/campaigns. there is also a non-canon in worldbuilding/campaigns with some notes from plaguelands, aborted family version of cleenseau i will likely mess around with the organization of my version of taelgar to make an "Other Campaigns" landing page for my "Other Campaigns" TOC. however for now the only complete list of campaigns in in the Campaigns/campaigns.md note, which is not intended to be published



**rsulfuratus**

05/28/2025 at 1:18 PM EDT

(which, separately, needs a bit of work)

1:18 PM

and hence live in the PCs directory

1:18 PM

excepting Ausson's Crossing and Great War PCs, which are canonical (Great War definitely, Ausson's Crossing according to what you've written in the campaigns directory)

1:17 PM

still planning on fiddling a bit more later today, although have meetings for a good chunk of the afternoon. the semi-canonical stuff (Great War, Ausson's Crossing, Stone Titan) likely to prove most complex but for now dumped it all into worldbuilding/campaigns



**rsulfuratus**

05/28/2025 at 1:06 PM EDT

pushed a reorg. happy to revert things you don't like in the future if you have more time to think



**Deciusmus**

05/28/2025 at 12:31 PM EDT

For semi-canon

12:30 PM

In general I think moving stuff to worldbuilding is usually the right move though

12:30 PM

I like that as a basic idea. Might not have time to think about in detail right now though



**rsulfuratus**

05/28/2025 at 12:25 PM EDT

proposed reorg of campaign directory, inspired by trying to get more OneNote stuff (mostly Great Library) into obsidian: (1) Reorganize with top-level directories for the four major canonical campaigns, (Cleenseau, Addermarch, Great Library, Dunmar), plus Mawar. (2) Add an Adventures top-level directory with a landing page, plus sub-directories for canonical and semi-canonical 1-4 session adventures. Right now Ausson's Crossing and Labyrinth of the Lost have campaign directories, while other short adventures do not, or don't have anything useful in them anyway. (3) Move Mechanics and Player's Guide to Background Open Questions: (1) Where to put non-canonical or semi-canonical stuff? Could make a Non-Canon directory to put any notes for non-canonical stuff as desired, but this will function more or less like the Brainstorming and/or Tentative parts of Worldbuliding and might just make sense to put in, say, Worldbuilding/Campaigns or something. (2) What do do with Great War? It is kind of in a unique semi-canonical position (other semi-canonical stuff is generally in the framework of "the background material is real but the events may not be", while great war is more "the setting has changed but the events are real")



**rsulfuratus**

05/27/2025 at 5:59 PM EDT

feel free to edit, add things, etc. i doubt that anyone else in the party will engage particularly deeply

5:58 PM

pushed an updated version of Vindristjarna Bastion rules that updates to the official versions in the DMG (from the old UA versions), and also clarifies the basic idea of how I think a mobile bastion might work (where you are constrained by space and crew instead of having to visit the bastion to gain benefits)



**rsulfuratus**

05/24/2025 at 12:10 PM EDT

pushing a bunch of great library geography stuff. haven't gotten to updating region pages but just in case you are curious...



**Deciusmus**

05/23/2025 at 12:05 PM EDT

But if I was just cleaning up rivers on the map from notes I might be inclined to just dump in the root river system and if that is outside a single region, fine

12:05 PM

But it is also probably fine if it is a bit arbitrary, if I was making up some small tributary of the Istabor that was mostly relevant for some adventure in Maseau I might be tempted to put it in the Maseau folder rather than some istabor folder

12:02 PM

I think it is reasonable to keep rivers together though, ie have the “chasa - nahadi” as a folder

12:01 PM

I think in the east the rivers are all pretty much in a region.



**rsulfuratus**

05/23/2025 at 11:35 AM EDT

messing around a bit with rivers in taelgarverse, primarily filling out the rest of the west coast chasa-nahadi system, where i have a lot of notes but not many names from the great library campaign. did we ever decide how we are supposed to organize these, e.g. if a river or river system flows through multiple gazetteer regions? for now i am putting them in the region if they are fully contained, and in major rivers if not, but i'm not sure that is ideal and ends up being kind of arbitrary based on where lines are drawn and not actually based on river size/length. i don't know if you have any thoughts or opinions or if it really matters much. an alterernative would be to put all of the chasa-nahadi watershed into major rivers, for example



**Deciusmus**

05/17/2025 at 8:58 PM EDT

(had friends over for dinner, so kinda lost the thread of this) my other idea was an elven scholar of some sort. realistically, I think this character is going to be minor, i.e. basically it is more backstory that might not even come up, or perhaps if the PCs are struggling a ghost of some sort who has been hiding out



**rsulfuratus**

05/17/2025 at 6:39 PM EDT

could be that the lakan monk was traveling in part to learn more about hobgoblins or something in the context of the northern war

6:39 PM

but that doesn't mean it can't happen

6:39 PM

only problem is travel from dunmar to sembara is pretty difficult at that time, that is in the middle of one of the dunmar/hobgoblin wars



**Deciusmus**

05/17/2025 at 6:38 PM EDT

1600



**rsulfuratus**

05/17/2025 at 6:38 PM EDT

it would be a little unusual but not out of place. when was this going on?



**rsulfuratus**

05/17/2025 at 5:35 PM EDT

getting to reuse a bunch of stuff

5:35 PM

running game for isaac + friends at the moment but will look in a bit while isaac is cooking. they are in castrella right now



**Deciusmus**

05/17/2025 at 5:15 PM EDT

In game this matters as I want some interesting ghost

5:15 PM

Question: would it be out of place to have a Lakan monk involved before it became evil, perhaps attracted by the idea of a cross-cultural magical center of learning and research.

5:13 PM

Then he pushes deep into learning re: undead and lich-stuff - which eventually has some interactions with Umdizka and leaves the place ruined and corrupted. Malach leaves with whatever knowledge

5:12 PM

The basic story is a place of research and learning re: souls is founded by Malach before he is known to be evil

5:11 PM

So I’m finally running the Umdizka temple / ruin adventure tomorrow



**rsulfuratus**

04/30/2025 at 8:06 PM EDT

Great will easily have time to clean up and push a bunch of stuff well before then



**Deciusmus**

04/30/2025 at 8:06 PM EDT

realistically August, as I think the lich plot will take 2 sessions



**rsulfuratus**

04/30/2025 at 8:06 PM EDT

Ah okay so that is likely July at earliest? That’s perfect



**Deciusmus**

04/30/2025 at 8:05 PM EDT

but after the lich reveal and getting the piece of the phylatcry, PCs will end up in the feywild

8:05 PM

my plot is running a bit slow because we skipped April and June, so we only have a May and July game

8:04 PM

yes



**rsulfuratus**

04/30/2025 at 8:04 PM EDT

A while ago we talked about a feywild arc in your game that might draw on some of the stuff I’ve developed recently. The cloud spinner arc is presumably wrapping up tomorrow and hopefully in about 1-2 weeks things at work will settle down a bit. So I’m close to in a position to push a bunch of new Feywild details. Is it still relevant?



**Deciusmus**

04/29/2025 at 5:55 PM EDT

right



**rsulfuratus**

04/29/2025 at 5:55 PM EDT

yeah i remember now. i think my idea was to make it ambigious if the moon itself as prisoner was also a "bad god" punished by being made into a prisoner or some kind of hero assigned the task



**Deciusmus**

04/29/2025 at 5:54 PM EDT

so to speak

5:54 PM

hence the bazaraheal getting some moon people going

5:54 PM

and then the big plot thing was that in my game some aberration/far realm entity was trying to break open the moon

5:54 PM

I think we had some other thoughts about how that would make the moon a bit complex, i.e. a prison / entity holding in the bad, but also some degree of the bad leaking out



**Deciusmus**

04/29/2025 at 5:48 PM EDT

i.e. what's his name, the god of slavery

5:48 PM

it was a prison for the gods who had been banished



**rsulfuratus**

04/29/2025 at 5:47 PM EDT

do you remember what the cool idea for the moon we had at Backbar was? something about prison for something?



**Deciusmus**

03/30/2025 at 11:45 AM EDT

I don't suppose you are around? I had a quick Moon-related question for my game in 30 minutes that I wanted to run by you



**rsulfuratus**

03/03/2025 at 11:00 AM EST

i've been pretty busy at work the past few weeks and then in my spare time have mostly been doing session prep and working on roll20 api scripts to automate some annoying aspects of combat, so haven't had much time to do any taelgarverse updates. but today is fairly light, actually, so i'm likely going to try to push a few updates, mostly probably focusing on region pages and check/tim stuff. fyi in case you are using your recovery as an excuse to not work much today



**Deciusmus**

02/09/2025 at 11:58 AM EST

I agree with the basic idea



**rsulfuratus**

02/09/2025 at 11:56 AM EST

i am getting a little carried away with feywild stuff, which i'm planning on pushing tonight and updating taelgarverse in prep for session thursday. a lot of the detail i'm writing is an expansion of the lore recorded by Ulfgar Frostbeard in his book, The Lore of the Feywild. currently, i'm writing this mostly on the note for The Lore of the Feywild itself, with some minor details/repetition on realm pages. i think this is consistent with just getting rid of primary sources as a category and trying to move the stuff there (eventually) into the relevant directories (e.g., religion, species, etc) but curious if you have other thoughts here



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 2:22 PM EST

yeah both in and out of game should be clearer about when the cloudspinner arc will wrap up by then



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 2:21 PM EST

Right so I’ll just need to decide in April when I’m working on my May session whether it’s kicking off the feywild arc or is filler



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 2:20 PM EST

i mean assuming that we stick to the pretty constant 2 sessions a month we've had for the past 5 years then i'd expect the cloudspinner arc to end no earlier than mid-April and no later than late May



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 2:20 PM EST

But if I do 2 sessions of filler and 2 sessions of phylactery that’s July for the feywild arc which I assume would be fine

2:18 PM

My arc is basically - fight a hag (next session) - phylactery - potentially 1-2 sessions of filler - feywild arc

2:17 PM

It doesn’t really matter right now - but probably I will make the Malach phylactery 2 sessions instead of 1 and then I’ll need to have a better idea. But that’s April, things should be much clearer with Eric by then. Mostly if you knew it was going to be wrapped up by April no matter what I was going to write the phylactery hunt as one session



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 2:14 PM EST

so i haven't really plotted beyond the next session really although i obviously have an arc but it could be 4 sessions or it could be 8 sessions (would be hard to make it longer than that)

2:13 PM

it is complicated because of Eric's situation as I don't necessarily want him to miss the whole thing but it is hard to predict when he'll feel like playing (and if he is taking a 6 month break we'll just have to do stuff without him)



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 2:12 PM EST

But I could push it out to June if you cloudspinner arc is going to be long, but I kinda assume not?

2:12 PM

When do you think the cloudspinner arc will be over? I’d like to use some of your stuff potentially for my feywild arc which will start either in april or may.



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 2:07 PM EST

i think there are lots of possibilities just the only restriction should be not to devise an explanation/metaphysics/in game clues that conflict with the idea that umdizka is also probably behind "lost souls" and related undead



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 2:06 PM EST

Right I guess that also works. I need to play around a bit with both what long term clues there might be here as well as what the actual in game challenges are going to be



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 2:05 PM EST

you could imagine metaphysically that umdizka consumse souls starting from the plane of creation side leaving them disembodied and cut off, but this time just kept going and ate the whole thing

2:05 PM

or in this case umdizka consumed their souls as punishment for malach trying (or succeeding) in using umdizka's knowledge/magic/whatever for his own purposes



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 2:03 PM EST

Actually maybe their souls are all still their trapping in their eyes which is all that’s left of them



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 2:03 PM EST

but that doesn't mean it can't happen, just the exact metaphysics of why in this case you have soulless husks and in other cases you have disembodied souls should be flexible

2:02 PM

i think that's fine. i guess i would want to leave the "their souls taken by umdizka" a little vague - as in, if umdizka is the force that creates things like haunts and ghasts and other "lingering signs of death" undead, which are abanonded souls / disconnected from the plane of consciousness / plane of creation, there is a bit of tension with also "consuming" souls



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 1:27 PM EST

so how do you think this works with those metaphysics: Malach, in his quest to discover the true nature of souls and life and death founded a sanctuary of seers and experimental magicians hidden away in the Cleenseau Wood. They sought to discover true nature of the Land of the Dead and what exactly the nature of life and death is. In their experiments, they unknowingly drew the attention of Umidzka. The seers have their souls taken by Umdizka, leaving behind only lifeless eyes, haunted to endlessly watch the sanctuary, and an endless connection to Umdizka, which fills the place with despair and emptiness and a sense of losing the will to live



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 1:17 PM EST

yeah, a cult of necromancers could work; I like all the metaphysics there



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 1:13 PM EST

so there could be natural connection between the headquarters of a cult of necromancers and a lich

1:12 PM

a lot of the details and rituals around binding a soul to the material plane theorectically overlap the details and rituals of constructing a phylactery

1:12 PM

this magic would probably be irredemably evil, and likely would be somehow associated with umdizka

1:11 PM

(2) 'undead soul magic' or whatever you want to call it is much more about how to break the bonds between a soul and the land of the dead or whatever, some complex metaphysics that stop the inevitable pull of the Plane of Creation that ultimately draws all souls to it

1:10 PM

this kind of magic, while probably perceived as largely evil, might not be irredemmibly evil and you could image a society where this is kind of normal, you have skeleton minions, etc



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 1:10 PM EST

(but I'm not really sure umdizka is the right source here, actually - although I like the changes above about simplifying the void mind metaphysyics)

1:10 PM

(the theory behind umdizka was that malach knew about this because he found some key to being a lich here)



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 1:10 PM EST

(1) 'traditional arcane magic' can animate a body, just like it can animate a ladder or a rock. but it can't create an ensouled undead

1:09 PM

so one thing i was thinking about is that you could think of necromancy magic as arising from two very different sources



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 1:08 PM EST

my actual goal is that (a) the next adventure in cleenseau is that the PCs are going to be sent to find one piece of the lich's phylactery (he has hidden 3 pieces around) (b) I have established that the phylactery is hidden in a creepy old ruin in the wilderness (c) there could be lots of sources for "creepy old ruin" but I was thinking an abandoned cult temple to Umdizka might be interesting (or some other "evil" temple) (d) that requires some thought about WHY there would be a cult temple associated with Umdizka and what that would mean, although the details can be a bit vague given it was long abandoned



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 1:08 PM EST

nine hells and abyss already exist and have origin stories not fully developed but not connected to the void mind

1:06 PM

to the extent that there is a need for an "outer plane of endless war" that can already be thark's domain

1:06 PM

i mean if you look at basic monster types there is not that much left to explain after thark (orcs), jinnik (lycanthropes), umdizka (undead), plus all the other stuff that's been invented

1:05 PM

yeah. and i agree that probably 4-6 or so is the right number



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 1:04 PM EST

but why that is is undefined

1:04 PM

metaphysically thark is more like an embodied god and jinnik and umdizka are more like mos numena archtype gods



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 1:04 PM EST

yes



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 1:04 PM EST

Right so is the suggestion to just get rid of the "Three Despairs" as a concept, and instead have (a) the Void Mind (b) these mysterious "bad things" created by it which canonically include Thark, the Mad One (perhaps retconned to be the same as Jinnick), and Umdikza but which don;t have canonical creation stories (c) further "bad things" can be invented as needed (but cautiously, there shouldn't be more than probably 4-5 total)



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 1:03 PM EST

jinnik canonically "lives" in pandemonium, but one interpretation of that is jinnik **is** pandemonium

1:02 PM

umdikza and jinnik are more like malevolent forces

1:02 PM

i think it is useful to keep the vibe of umdikza and jinnik separate from the vibe of thark

1:01 PM

Umdikza is that something else. their exact origins can be totally mysterious (in game and out of game), although in some way derived from the void mind, most likely (as opposed to e.g. demon lords that likely arise from humanity's worst impulses via the divine spark)

1:00 PM

so, i think that suggests: the transition a soul makes from the material plane to the land of the dead in some way opens an extraplanar portal. this allows the soul to depart, but also, sometimes, allow something else to sneak in

12:58 PM

more brainstorming: another observation is that undead are more common in places of traumatic death, and especially lots of traumatic death. e.g., all the plague-affected places (kharsan, drankor); the zombies in sembara tending to rise (at least in part) from old battlefields; just general D&D/adventure planning usefulness

12:57 PM

right



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 12:56 PM EST

I was originally thinking it was somehow related to one of the Three Despairs but ultimately it never came up in game and the whole metaphysics actually works better for it to have been some Far Realms interusion

12:56 PM

the only thing that came up in game was a abberation that had appeared in the old dwarven mines and was ultimately trying to grow large and strong enough to "fully break free"



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 12:56 PM EST

some of it could be demons and devils but that doesn't feel like the complete answer, and that can't explain the perceived dangers of getting lost on the material plane afte death before reaching the land of the dead in the first place

12:55 PM

otherwise, why all the focus on rituals to protect the dead and why the gidari to guard the land of the dead and all taht



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 12:54 PM EST

in the aussons crossing game I ended up not reall using a connection to the "void mind" per se



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 12:54 PM EST

that said: I think there is some value in having some kind of god-like entity that somehow makes the transition to the land of the dead / the journey through the land of the dead dangerous

12:54 PM

as its now been almost 5 years of running games in "modern" Taelgar (longer if you count the non-canonical early Plaguelands campaign), i'm increasingly inclined to drop metaphysical concepts that were invented early on but have never impacted in-game lore

12:52 PM

the Void Mind clearly is a useful game contstruct to generate evil gods while overall keeping the Divine Presence essentially god aligned (and is in some respects a replacement for the Tokien-derived Melkor/etc in high school)

12:51 PM

i'm actually not sure that the basic framework of the Void Mind -> Three Despairs -> Embodied Gods necessarily makes sense and it honestly has not come up in lore. Jinnik keeps getting treated as an embodied god (e.g., see the Pandemonium note), and Thark of course is an embodied god

12:50 PM

re: Umdikza, I haven't really thought much about the three despairs. actually despite having a fair bit of notes on undead (many of which are in the undead note or in the various fate of souls / land of the dead / funerary tradition notes), i'm not sure there is much, or any, canonical lore that exists about Umdikza, except perhaps whatever you invented for your Ausson's Crossing game



**rsulfuratus**

02/07/2025 at 12:05 PM EST

but i should have a bit of time later this afternoon

12:05 PM

i have actually had to work the past couple of days as i didn't work much earlier this week as i was behind on session prep; i also have been messing with roll20 to improve automation to make combat run faster (wrote an API script to automatically prompt concentration checks on damage, for example)



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 11:57 AM EST

Anyway the point being if you do have any thoughts or feelings would be useful to share if you have a moment



**Deciusmus**

02/07/2025 at 11:35 AM EST

mostly session prep stuff, as I have a game on Sunday; but I'm also working on my March session prep, which is where the question about Umdikza comes from

11:35 AM

I'm home sick today but feeling better than I was yesterday so I am working on taelgar stuff a bit

11:34 AM

I've been playing with GPT 4o (which I get about 20 minutes free a day on the free plan) and you are right it is way more creative than older chat gpts



**Deciusmus**

02/06/2025 at 9:22 PM EST

Have you thought at all about in what specific way Umdikza is related to undeath?



**Deciusmus**

02/05/2025 at 2:31 PM EST

Right. So Robin's lantern could be an echo of an echo, i.e. like how the phial of Galadriel is an echo of an echo of the light of the Simarils



**rsulfuratus**

02/05/2025 at 1:29 PM EST

(of course eventually they all went dark)

1:29 PM

the idea is supposed to be a way for the refuges and defenses of amberglow to hang on without Cloudspinner's direct power

1:29 PM

Aelirios presumably was one of the fey lords who had an amberlight and used it to do things

1:27 PM

i liked your midjourney image so ran with it

1:27 PM

the Lantern is not itself an Amberlight, but the vibe was inspired by it

1:27 PM

Amberlights, yes



**Deciusmus**

02/05/2025 at 11:49 AM EST

btw, I assume idea of Amberglow was meant to harken back to the Lantern of the Bright Hearth, i.e. likely Aerlios made it out of Amberglow or it in some fashion has some relationship to Amberglow



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 9:53 PM EST

He has sent single ones of them to enforce stuff

9:52 PM

Ive been running them as more like lieutenants than foot soldiers



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 9:52 PM EST

*then

9:52 PM

maybe i'll make something else to be the foot soliders them

9:52 PM

ah okay, the vibe seemed a bit more like the foot soliders



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 9:51 PM EST

Or ie I wouldn’t expect Umbraeth to have 100s of them around.

9:51 PM

I do see the duskhounds as a little bit like “mini Nazgûl” or something less like soldiers, ie I wouldn’t expect them in general to be quite as weak as minions, although I guess some minions can be relatively strong

9:47 PM

Yes, the fear aura more about “they are scary”



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 9:47 PM EST

i am making a minion version of duskhounds for you all



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 9:46 PM EST

I mean not actually mindless. But they aren’t his lieutenants- they are more like his muscle



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 9:46 PM EST

right yeah, but the fear aura is more about they are scary (like how a dragon is scary) than about some innate connection to fear (like how drankor is terrifying)



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 9:46 PM EST

They are supposed to be a bit mindless

9:45 PM

But ultimately the duskhounds have a bit of an enforcer vibe

9:45 PM

The fey bosses are probably a bit more “themed”

9:44 PM

Yeah



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 9:43 PM EST

is that the vibe from your game?

9:43 PM

one more. my sense of umbraeth's vibe is all about rigged games, about cruelty, about the idea of the hunt. despite the way the duskhounds are statted it really isn't about like the fear of darkness or traditional ghost story kind of things



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 9:24 PM EST

in play my PCs fought 2 different duskhounds; one was a ordered to stay put and guard a retreat, so didn't use its mostly infinite misty step mobility. That was not super hard (esp as the whole party made the save against fright aura). The other was jumping around with every attack and was much much more of a challenge.

do you have the fantasy stat block plugin?

9:19 PM

I forgot we had a worldbuilding\mechanics

(in worldbuilding)

9:18 PM

just put it in mechanics and push it



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 9:18 PM EST

not sure the best way to share bestiary. I have a bunch of stuff stat'd in obsidian in my DM folder..



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 9:11 PM EST

there is rumored to be a statblock for a city-sized ooze, for example, just coincidentally

9:11 PM

supposed to have more interesting high level monsters

9:10 PM

the new monster manual is coming out tomorrow so i may also see if there is anything interesting in there

9:10 PM

i'd take a look



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 9:10 PM EST

I have a couple of other stat’d fey enemies as well if you want - other bosses mostly for my current “fey enemies” arc

9:08 PM

It’s aimed to be “boss-level” for 6th level party

9:08 PM

Yes I have a stated duskhound. I’m not at my computer but can send you in a bit



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 9:07 PM EST

not that i would use them exactly but might be useful to see the vibes

9:07 PM

duskhounds?

9:07 PM

you said you had some umbraeth enemy stats?



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 7:46 PM EST

once i decide what I'm using for this adventure i'm going to dump 100 raw ideas from chatgpt in brainstorming for fey realms.



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 7:40 PM EST

maybe that's where Gloamscar is

7:40 PM

I have often wondered what this is:

**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 7:39 PM EST

(the names often need some pushing although that one is not bad)

7:39 PM

kind of want to put this somewhere: Gloamscar – A land where daylight has been wounded, the sky torn open to reveal something older and darker than the Feywild itself, watched over by the fey warlock Severance, Keeper of the Rift.



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 7:39 PM EST

I do not



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 7:39 PM EST

do you pay for chatgpt? i don't know if they have updated things recently but I've found the recent versions of the 4o model to be shockingly creative



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:59 PM EST

Others are various gradations of power. But probably there are not more than half a dozen of the “great fey” or whatever in the region from west coast through western green sea

6:58 PM

Separately: my feeling is that some archfey (ethlenn, cloud spinner among those invented so far) are ancient (possibly predating the riving) and significantly more powerful than “typical archfey”

6:56 PM

It just gives space for inventing a bunch of minor archfey and allows boundaries to be sharp in some places and gradual in others

6:55 PM

But in some sense the distinction is a bit artificial

6:55 PM

Right. I think my idea is that all the feywild is divided into domains of influence, but “Amberglow proper” or whatever might be smaller than “amberglow extended”



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:44 PM EST

As an aside, looking at that map, I actually think it might work better if the Refuge of the Gossamer Veil was in the "Amberglow influence" area, not in Amberglow itself.

6:41 PM

i.e. it could have been that Ethlenn retreated due to some impact of the Plague/red mist

6:41 PM

secondarily, btw, there is no requirement that this "Dangerous fey area" has to have predated the Great War

6:40 PM

I have no opinions about whether the actual line of sunset can move or not

6:39 PM

the only thing about the sunset gate is it is meant to be the actual line of sunset



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:39 PM EST

right



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:39 PM EST

the plaguelands provides plenty of "non-fey" dangers



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:39 PM EST

also i assume the sunset gate doesn't have to be fixed - i.e. there is no reason it couldn't have moved after cloudspinner's disappearance



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:39 PM EST

yes. although the ENTIRE yellow circle doesnt' have to be dangerous. The only canonical thing I'm working with here is a general vibe in the foothill/border towns in Tyrwingha that the hills aren't safe, and that in particular, the fey you might encounter in the hills might be dangerous in unexpected ways

6:38 PM

right



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:38 PM EST

so the west part of your yellow circle is addermarch contested land, the east part is maybe something else, with the sunset gate running in the middle



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:37 PM EST

Yeah



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:37 PM EST

i think addermarch works well as "contested territory" that is a buffer

6:37 PM

i like the umbraeth can't cross the sunset gate a lot



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:37 PM EST

As far as Umbraeth: I don't think there should be a DIRECT border where Duskmire and Twilight's Grace touch each other I had this idea that Umbraeth can't cross the Sunset Gate but that doesn't have to be canonical



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:36 PM EST

well it isn't going to stay secret past March or April or whenever the cloudspinner arc finishes



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:35 PM EST

Although I might care about the details sometime this summer, so if you make something up, it can't stay secret forever



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:35 PM EST

but umbreath is trapped west of the sunset gate so this is not umbreath, correct?



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:35 PM EST

but why that is does not matter in the slightlest to me

6:35 PM

should be, in parts at least, on Taelgar at least, somewhat dangerous, enough that folks in Tyrwingha warn people about "going too far up in the hills"

6:34 PM

basically the yellow circle here:

![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/321_1_1_image.png.SbYIgZGSqw.png)

311.96KB

6:33 PM

The fey and material plane geography might not have an exact correspondence here

6:32 PM

but that could just be leakage on the Material Plane from the Darkwood or whatever.

6:32 PM

Although the general vibe of Tyrwingha has been... "be careful in the hills, folks, if you go too far you might stray over the line and meet dark and dangerous fey"

6:31 PM

I don't really have any strong feelings honestly



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:31 PM EST

do you care?



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:31 PM EST

none



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:31 PM EST

you have presumably not given any thought to what is south of twilight's grace

6:29 PM

i don't think the politics of the feywild north of the mostreve will come up in the cloudspinner arc

6:28 PM

right the dotted lines are not canonical and have room for whatever



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:28 PM EST

?

6:28 PM

Although I would prefer if we don't settle on a canonical northern edge of this - this map puts all of Sembara under Ethlenn's "sphere of influence" or sharpspire, and I'm not 100% convinced that is correct. But I think for your purposes the exact details of the northern boundaries here (i.e. is Ethlenn's sphere actually only as far north as the Semb, or the Sharpspire one only as far north as the Wistel) doesn't really matter



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:26 PM EST

dotted line being "sunset gate runs somewhere roughly here tbd"

sure



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 6:23 PM EST

can you change sunset gate to run up the teft, btw. I do have an "along the sunset gate" adventure planned, which will probably be along the Mostreve Hills Tyrwingha/Addermarch boundary but if I decide I don't want it there the Teft is much better than the Volta for various reasons



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 6:23 PM EST

but basically: sharpspire = highlands amberglow = river valleys west of sunset gate twilight's grace = orenlas + sembaran lowlands + river valleys east of sunset gate

6:22 PM

steel blue = shimmersong dark blue = sharpspire violet = twilight's grace yellow/orange = amberglow red = sunset gate exact boundries of dotted line "sphere of influence" not precise

02/03/2025 at 2:19 PM EST

i have another meeting but possibly more later



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 2:18 PM EST

but honestly, it is probably better to run him as if they succeeded, and there is no fey portal in Cleenseau; easy enough for someone else to have succeeded between 1720 and 1749 if my PCs dont (and realsitically, it is pretty unusual for PCs to fail at major quests)

2:17 PM

There is this weird unresolved question of whether the Cleenseau campaign cut him off from the material plane or not; if they fail I think he'd care less about the southern part of his realm

2:16 PM

I do not think he needs to be tied up



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 2:15 PM EST

there are a few basic possibilities i'm toying with but i'm curious how important it is that he be tied up and not feature too much in the next dunmar arc



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 2:15 PM EST

unless he can get her to agree in some way that everything that is his is his forever

2:15 PM

yeah he's going to hate it



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 2:15 PM EST

so obviously umbreath - assuming the situation is basically unchanged in 1749 - is going to have thoughts and feelings about Cloudspinner's return



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 2:14 PM EST

I could see my players being interested in a high level quest to try to retake some of Duskmire or whatever but I think that would intriscincally have to be after Cloudspinner is restored, or they have no place for allies

2:13 PM

I don't really envision them trying to overthrow Umbraeth or whatever, and Ethlenn is explicitly anti-expansionist

2:12 PM

at least, without treking across addermarch or maseau or whatever

2:12 PM

So the "victory" condition is basically to shut down that portal, and lock him out of the human world

2:12 PM

(the others being in the darkwood or the northern plaguelands or whatever)

2:11 PM

and in fact might JUST be the portal in the Cleenseau wood

2:11 PM

re: Umbraeth. The basic plotline I'm setting up is about access to the Material Plane. It is canonically important that the places where Umbraeth can get to the Material Plane that are also places where there are a lot of people is relativelty limited



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 2:09 PM EST

re: east, mostly ethlenn allies, no?

2:09 PM

on a separate topic (related) - what is the Umbreath end game in your campaign? e.g. are you imagining your players are going to get deeply involved in fey politics and shake something up?



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 2:09 PM EST

whatever keeps Umbraeth from moving east from duskmire or north is not well defined but also not a "big player" that looks outside its borders

2:08 PM

yeah I agree



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 2:08 PM EST

i think it is better to keep the "major powers" relatively few - of course room for more invention in the north and to the west but i think probably other fey powers in greater sembara + upper istaros + eastern dunmar should largely not be "big players"



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 2:07 PM EST

Actually from a fey politics perspective I like the idea of some kind of alliance between Ethlenn / Sharpshire / Cloudspinner and this zone of allies between them, where all of the fey lords there are basically vassals to one of them



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 2:06 PM EST

e.g. there could be a sharp border in the north that duskmire can't expand into because it is controled by the Lord of the Beasts or whatever, but he is not a player in fey politics the way Ethlenn/Cloudspinner/unnamed lord of Sharpspire are/were



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 2:06 PM EST

the northern realms could be inward looking

2:06 PM

yeah



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 2:06 PM EST

i'm making a distinction between someone like the Lightdancer, who is clearly an archfey but also somewhat inward-looking, from the "big players" who are more outward-looking



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 2:05 PM EST

but lots of minor fey mostly with allegiances to one of the "big players" on the outside

2:05 PM

where the pink circle is the "buffer zone" with no major archfey

2:05 PM

but you could imagine something like:

image.png

1.22MB

2:04 PM

although the exact details don't matter

2:04 PM

there is actually probably more like 4 or 5 powers, because there needs to be something in the north as well



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 2:04 PM EST

so that is the contested area now. ethlenn being the only of the three original "fey powers" still active in 1720

2:03 PM

ethlenn's vassals still hold on in fellburn, wistel, ozabal, etc



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 2:03 PM EST

yeah



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 2:03 PM EST

(or at least, it might be relevant but the exact details don't matter for your campaign if the basic pattern of expansion holds)

2:02 PM

isn't really relevant exactly where the borders of these realms are

2:02 PM

Sharpspire falls next, duskmire can expand north

2:02 PM

Amberglow falls first, so duskmire can expand west / southwest

2:01 PM

even if there is some other random fey realms scattered around there, hard for umbreath to make a move with the three "major powers" of the east watching him

2:01 PM

that puts a lot of eyes on the upper istaros and southern sembara

2:00 PM

if you imagine that, originally, Sharpspire, Amberglow, and Twilight's Grace are three strong fey realms, allied to a degree that share a somewhat common purpose and morality

2:00 PM

but umbreath could have been constrained in other ways

1:59 PM

ah hmm yeah i was not imagining sharpspire extending that far east into the lowlands



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:59 PM EST

then when "mystery weird thing" replaced Sharpshire with "scary danger", Umbraeth took advantage

1:58 PM

unless you have concerns, the idea was that pre-Great War Sharpshire stretched as far east as Cleanseau/Rinburg, but didn't go south of the Enst

1:58 PM

we worked that out already in the chat

1:58 PM

Ah, that is the Great War



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:57 PM EST

e.g. what lets duskmire take cleenseau?

1:57 PM

i think the unanswered question (more for your campaign than mine) is there needs to be something keeping duskmire from expanding north early that then fails



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:57 PM EST

In fact, the Refugee of the Gossamar Veil could have been a mini-realm supported by Cloudspinner, not part of Amberglow proper



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:56 PM EST

sure



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:56 PM EST

just that it was probably Amberglow vassal states or whatever.

1:56 PM

right, no didn't mean that

1:56 PM

which suggests that the Maseau Gap/March of Andonne area probably should not have been "open"



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:56 PM EST

right, but that's doesn't have to imply that amberglow borders darkwood



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:55 PM EST

I personally think the history of Duskmire works a little bit better if Umbraeth can't easily expand when it is first granted, and he only grows when Cloudspinner falls



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:54 PM EST

roughly but not 100% exactly where and also need to give a bit of thought to isingue and a few other things



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:53 PM EST

Are you thinking the Andonne, basically?



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:53 PM EST

then the arrows are incursions into amberglow basically



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:53 PM EST

I think the key question is where is the northern border of AMberglow before her capture



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:53 PM EST

*west

1:53 PM

(this is potentially before cloudspinner's capture as this is probably further north than amberglow)

1:53 PM

basically, duskmire can expand east as far as the mountains

1:52 PM

duskmire dark green

1:52 PM

shimmersong is yellow

1:52 PM

so you have then:

**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:49 PM EST

yeah it doesn't matter to me. the Teft might make it a bit more in line with where it "should be"



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:48 PM EST

but it could for example follow the teft instead of the volta, not sure that really matters in the north

1:48 PM

yeah that is the idea



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:47 PM EST

it should follow this line: Here an ancient line of border stones running to [[~High Peak of Tyrwinghan Ridge~]] demarcates the border with [[Tyrwingha]]. These stones are said by some to be raised by Drankor, but they are marked with complex warnings in [[Sylvan Writing|Sylvan]], and many believe they have fey origins.

1:47 PM

right



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:47 PM EST

and actively contested between duskmire and ethlenn vassals but not ethlenn herself

1:46 PM

i am pretty sure i want addermarch on the other side of the sunset gate from twilight's grace

1:46 PM

i was just following major geographic features - istaros to hills to enst to coast to volta



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:46 PM EST

but it doesn't have to be the full border

1:46 PM

although it does need to touch Twlight's Grace somewhere

1:45 PM

that works, although I don't think it has to push as far east

1:44 PM

right, or a similar vassal state



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:44 PM EST

sunset gate something like?

![](../External/.deciusmus_media/rsulfuratus/419_1_1_image.png.jiRnNPgOhE.png)

image.png

1.09MB

1:44 PM

right, fellburn area is presumably lord serenveil



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:43 PM EST

(d) Duskmire does **not** stretch as far east as Fellburn

1:43 PM

basically the only canonical stuff is (a) Duskmire was originally just the Darkwood, which is just on the western side of Sunset Gate (b) Duskmire expanded after Cloudspinner was captured to include some fragments of the northern part of Amberglow (time and details not determined) (c) Duskmire today stretches as far north as the Wistel and includes the whole Cleenseau wood, but the western and eastern borders are unclear



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:41 PM EST

so wondering what is fixed and what is variable. the expansion of duskmire northwest to cleenseau obviously fixed

1:40 PM

(although the sunset gate doesn't have to be perfectly north-south)



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:40 PM EST

yeah, it is old



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:40 PM EST

that is slightly inaccurate in some details, e.g. Addermarch is not part of Ethlenn's domain and the sunset gate should run (mostly) north-south, with the darkwood on the west side, not the east side



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:40 PM EST

although the southern border is not canonical

1:38 PM

there is a map on the Duskmire page



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:37 PM EST

where is the Refuge of the Gossamar Veil supposed to be? Do you have any clear sense of the borders of Duskmire in 1720?



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:31 PM EST

Basically look at the new Refuge of Gossamar Veil page; I dropped the Charitable Wanderer connection and dumped a bunch of %% notes on my intended goals for these characters in the future. If you wanted to make Aerilios part of some larger "pro Cloudspinner" group, or have Aerilios' reason for caring about Cedric Cynwild be something to do with covert support Ethlenn was providing to refugees in Amberglow those both work. The chat on "Discord Chat - Fey Realms" in obisidian has a lot of (still accurate) stuff about Ethllen/Umbraeth/plans etc although I've committed very little of that as canonical



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:24 PM EST

I pushed some updates



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 1:09 PM EST

The only real connection to Cloudspinner is that Aerilois Sunblade was presumably one of her knights (but actually, it he could have been born after she died, and could have just grown up in the Refuge, it isn't really clear)

1:08 PM

So really the only thing that I'd consider canonical is what's the Greymalkin's story. And the dates for Cedric probably need to move to pre-Great War, although I guess it is undetermined when Umbraeth took over the Refugee of the Gossamer Veil

1:07 PM

But I think the whole order of the charitable wanderer connection doesn't really work, and I never introduced it in game, because it seemed off

1:06 PM

Cedric is kinda constructed to be a heroic inspiration/precursing to one of my PCs (Robin) with the idea that Robin could, in some fashion, be compared back to him / find his stuff / etc.

1:05 PM

so in 1749 this is all history - this is part of Duskmire now

1:05 PM

the other key thing about Aerlirios was that he died when Umbraeth took over the Refuge of the Gossamer Veil

1:05 PM

he made a fancy magic item for Cedric

1:04 PM

he had some type of relationship with Cedric (a Tyrwinghan) - although Cedric's dates shouldn't be considered canonical

1:03 PM

the only real idea is that Aerlirios was a fey paladin/warrior of some sort who was guarding/protecting some pocket of Amberglow that he was trying to keep safe / keep from falling to various forces that might be trying to take it over

1:02 PM

but basically this is all post Cloudspinner; these events are all in the time period say 1300 - 1500 or so

1:02 PM

I'm adding a page of The Refuge of the Gossamer Veil with the vibes so far



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 1:01 PM EST

there are hints at some important story between Cedric / the Lantern of the Bright Hearth / Aerlirios Sunblade / the Order of the Charitable Wanderer but it isn't really clear exactly how it all connects and how, if at all, it connects back to Amberglow



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 12:58 PM EST

ah



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 12:58 PM EST

I was looking at this comment in Aeliros Sunblade: %% There is some background in [[Greymalkin's Story]] but I haven't really made anything up. I do have plans to use him some more %%



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 12:57 PM EST

Greymalkin's Story has pretty much everything I've made up



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 12:57 PM EST

later this can be merged with the existing rivers

12:57 PM

For (c) - you can make a new layer "new rivers" or something to test to make sure it looks good so you don't accidentally mess up existing rivers

12:56 PM

*from your game

12:56 PM

i have a meeting in 5 minutes but when i get a chance this afternoon i need to figure out some fey politics for tomorrow and it would be helpful to understand a bit more of the context and the intended development for some of the stuff that touches on amberglow (i think from obsidian greymalkin and aelirios sunblade but i'm not totally clear)

12:54 PM

but pretty sure the place pages are all just stubs anyway and need me to fill in from my notes

12:54 PM

Also for (a) - really Drankor (the place) and all the other places in the "history" should be moved to gazetteer and Drankorian Empire (the realm) should probably stay in history for now



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 12:54 PM EST

yeah for (a) wasn't going to move anything out of gazetter



**rsulfuratus**

02/03/2025 at 12:53 PM EST

For (a) - reasonable; i think that we decided to put off for now final decisions about what belongs in Gazetteer vs elsewhere but it makes sense to make the pages. the Dunmar directory is already largely organized this way (separate pages on realms vs geography)

12:52 PM

For (b) - yes, that is good to do. you might grab my dataview query from the Cosmology landing page to just make a table of backlinks in staging in directory in the dm notes for each region page

12:51 PM

For (c) - Rivers: KYLE sketch pencil rough (1 or 2), play with size, flow; color #181f5a



**Deciusmus**

02/03/2025 at 12:50 PM EST

(c) what brush did you use for rivers, do you know? there are 1 or 2 sembara tributaries I'd like to add to the official amp

I'm probably going to try to do a little cleanup on gazetter today - a few little topics: (a) any objections to starting to separate out articles on places from peoples? 3 examples: - Drankor (the city) vs Drankorian Empire (the empire) - Skaer (the people) vs Skaerhaem (the islands) - Cymea (the province(s)) vs Cymean Peninsula (the place) (b) I think we agreed all unnamed places should go in staging? Might try to clean that up a bit



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 9:48 PM EST

There is probably stuff in between where it might make sense to add a short note in the DM Notes section (either on brainstorming or canonical, depending) to say something to just point out some minimal details of where the secret is



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 9:39 PM EST

Something like the Vargarldi, pre-discovery, which you want to be canonical even if we had never found them, is probably best done exactly how I wrote the vargardli text on the main northern green sea coast - I'm not sure there is huge value in keeping the fact that there are northerns up there secret - the interesting in game reveal was the details

9:35 PM

Something like, I dunno, a secret group of evil awakened trees on the western slopes of the north sentinels probably doesn't need a region note at all. It is small enough that it isn't really going to impact worldbuilding in the region and its sorta dubiously canonical, in that if it never comes up in an adventure is it really real?

9:31 PM

I guess it depends a bit on what the implication of the secret is/was. In some cases why does it need to be indicated?



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 9:25 PM EST

*in world not in game

9:25 PM

these would usually be on the edges of the map - i think there is not much value in secret worldbuilding for e.g. the north chardon coast where there isn't any reason it would be secret in-game. more like the vargaldi type places

9:24 PM

whatever time i have for d&d stuff between now and tuesday has to be devoted to session prep, but as a general question: there are a few corners of the world i've done some secret development on, either because i potentially thought they might come up and didn't, or because i just have an idea for something that might make a good adventure. i'm not sure how to best indicate this - if at all - on the region pages.

9:22 PM

poking around at region pages a little. i like the vibe and the basic framework a lot



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 6:35 PM EST

But I agree the halfling stuff can be a useful way to convey uncertainity of information as well, i.e. The halflings, drawing on their ancestral memory, say that no humans have touched the land until the Drankorians arrived from the south in the Year of the Gentle Rain

6:34 PM

i.e. it may be fine to have something like The Skaer say X and the Drankorian records say Y without ever resolving which one is actually true, as long as they don't have major present day issues

6:33 PM

For history, I was leaning a little bit more towards the "scholars in Tollen" approach and away from the halfling one just because imagining the historical conflicts was kinda fun, and I actually think that, outside of some of the framework documents, there is something to be said for the fact that there doesn't have to be one true history.

6:32 PM

the page isn't really meant to be 100% done, just far enough to show the vibe.

6:31 PM

i had forgotten

6:31 PM

yeah I pushed a map



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 6:06 PM EST

this is great too: "_(The sources for this period, including when exactly Cymea recovered from the fall of Drankor, and what Cymean cultures were competing or cooperating is hopelessly confused in the sources, and the Editors have not attempted here to untangle a most likely true version)_"

6:05 PM

(also as an aside, i think you forgot to push the region map itself?)

6:04 PM

i think it works really well. obviously some bits are unfinished (e.g., geography / climate) and there are a few places i might add a bit of detail to cymea where i have a pretty good mental image (and there is some detail on western cymea invented but not well-documented). but i think the "halfling travelers" framework has a lot of potential. a few other notes on history in particular: - halflings record the song of each year, so there is also an opportunity to place canonical events that are not well-dated as happening "in the year of gentle rain" or whatever, without indicating when exactly that is in DR / CY (although I also like the cymean conflicting claims here) - halflings also have their ancestral memory, which is not exactly a photographic record but can be quite useful for vibes based stuff: "the ancestors long ago recall this as a land of Drankorian people, blah blah blah..." (and of course the ancestral memory does not need to be perfect or complete, but shouldn't be totally wildly wrong) for current day stuff (civilizations and culture): - i think it could use actually more of the vibes like "In the north, the halflings say, the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] are safe, and a good source of [[Skaer Steel|rare metals]] - but unwelcoming to outsiders looking to stay permanently. Those who do not worship the ocean god [[Kaikkea]] rarely find a home amongst the volcanoes and rocky islands of [[Skaerhem]]." i think that kind of thing is great



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 3:03 PM EST

It is in-world with (Notes - Eds) where things are not made up. There are no intentional blank spots really so I didn't write "mysterious rumors" but you can see a little bit of how I left blank spots and undecided stuff in the historical story

3:02 PM

But I pushed a Western Green Sea page that I'm pretty happy with

3:02 PM

ok I have zachary's d&d game shortly so I need to switch from taelgar to pulling together a few notes on the Ghosts of Saltmarsh module I'm running for him

02/02/2025 at 2:43 PM EST

#### Cymean Era CY 5192 - CY 5678 After the fall of Drankor in DR 1059, [[Cymea]] emerged as a major maritime power, and although the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] attempted to expand in this period as well, they were not able to restore the ancient Skaer empire, and instead mostly raided the coasts of [[Sembara]] and [[Tyrwingha]]. By the time of the [[Great War]], it was [[Cymea]], not the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], who dominated the seas. (The sources for this period, including when exactly Cymea recovered from the fall of Drankor, and what Cymean cultures were competing or cooperating is hopelessly confused in the sources, and the Editors have not attempted here to untangle a most likely true version) #### Tollish Era (CY 5678 - Present) In the aftermath of the [[Great War]], [[Cymea]] suffered much, and was never able to reclaim its place as a maritime power. Instead, the navies of [[Tollen]] filled the gap, and in the modern day it is [[Tollen]] navies that dominate [[Western Cymea]] and the shipping lanes of the western [[Green Sea]]. Although the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] continue to live on their islands in relative isolation, they are no longer a power on the western [[Green Sea]].

2:43 PM

#### Drankorian Era CY 4535 - 5192 As the Drankorian Empire expanded north, coastal provinces in the lands left behind by the vanished non-human empires ([[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]] and the [[~Ancient Lizardfolk Swamp~]]) were established quickly, although sources disagree as to the exact founding dates. Many local Cymean sources ascribe unrealistically early founding dates (such as DR 2 or DR 100) to local cities and provinces but few believe these. However, by DR 402 (CY 4535) the well-attested [[Treaty of Marhavn]] was signed in [[Tollen]], which formalized that withdrawal of the [[Skaer]] from all lands and seas west of the [[Volta]] and south of the [[Straits of Cymea]]. The [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] retreated in this period, and although numerous Skaer sailing vessels were seen along the coasts of [[Vostok]] and crossing between the islands of [[Skaerhem]], the western shores and bays of the [[Green Sea]] were dominated by the Drankorians, according to modern [[Cymea|Cymean]] histories. (Some the Cymean sources that define a Drankorian dominance may not be accurate, but alternative versions have not been invented yet! - Eds.)

2:43 PM

what do you think: ## Major Historical Eras The story of the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] is well attested in religious and legendary sagas on the island, but independent verification of the facts is often difficult or impossible. The history of the [[Cymea|Cymean]] realms is difficult to untangle as many stories and chronicles have been written to justify modern events, and the truth of these chronicles is often questionable. That said, historians in [[Tollen]] will agree on at least a broad story: #### Skaer Era Before CY 4535 The [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] settled the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] in the ancient days before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], one of several human cultures that arose from the great [[~Mariners~|Mariner Exodus]] from [[Hkar]]. The Skaer established an maritime empire centered on the [[Vostok]] coast and the [[Western Gulf]], but also stretching as far south as the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]] and as far west as [[Embry]]. The Skaer claim their empire included the [[~Cymean Archipelago~]], but some [[Cymea|Cymean]] sources often describe the archipelago as uninhabited when the Drankorians arrived. Other sources claim the [[~Cymean Archipelago~]] was never Skaerish or Drankorian. (The details of what these "other sources" say is known but not yet invented. - Eds.)



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 1:43 PM EST

That works quite well I think



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 12:39 PM EST

The halfling story of the western [[Green Sea]] is one of mariners and sailors, crumbing [[Cymea|coastal cities]] and proudly independent [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], numerous settlements along the coast, and mystery and danger inland. In the north, the halflings say, the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] are safe, and a good source of [[Skaer Steel|rare metals]] - but unwelcoming to outsiders looking to stay permanently. Those who do not worship the ocean god [[Kaikkea]] rarely find a home amongst the volcanoes and rocky hills of [[Skaerhem]]. The [[Cymean Peninsula]], and the [[~Cymean Archipelago~]] is a land of humans, long Drankorian provinces, and later a maritime power, it is now a place in decline. The numerous cities there are loosely called [[Cymea]] by the halflings, but a variety of different city-states squabble for dominance. (The halflings would know the details of Cymea, including what non-humans live amongst the humans, but it hasn't been invented yet. - Eds.) South of the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]], lies more [[~South Cymea~|human lands]], once Drankorian provinces and later, after the fall of Drankor, traders with the cities of the [[Istabor Alliance]]. Since the destruction of [[Isingue]] during the [[Great War]], this land is diminished. (The halflings would know the details of South Cymea, including what non-humans live there, but it hasn't been invented yet. - Eds.) Inland of the human settlements, the land turns dangerous, and halflings warn travelers away.



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 12:00 PM EST

I might take a stab at a halfling perspective page for one of the easier/simpler regions and see how it feels from both a fun/effort and usefulness perspective



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 11:59 AM EST

but, having player-facing region pages i think also works for simplicity



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 11:58 AM EST

that is a very interesting idea

11:58 AM

huh



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 11:58 AM EST

that said it might be fun to write all the region landing pages from a halfling perspective for example, which could usefully give you in-world doubts and unknowns about dangerous / fringe places, while just using editorial comments to clarify when not much is said because of lack of development



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 11:58 AM EST

yes I agree with all that



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 11:56 AM EST

i'd suggest: - unlike cosmology, i don't think it is useful or achievable to have a specific tone for gazetteer - a lot of gazetteer secrets and undeveloped things, unlike cosmology, and things that someone in world knows about, just not the *players*, so in-world style is less useful in many (but not all) cases for finessing secrecy - the major driver of in-world writing should largely be fun, not game needs - in-world pages should use italicized editorial notes to clarify/explain undeveloped but not secret things



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 11:55 AM EST

But I think I agree that the gazetteer landing pages are much better and easier to write as player facing and link-dense, where if for example I wanted to write an in-world history page, you just link there for details



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 11:53 AM EST

right



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 11:51 AM EST

I guess for a specific gazetteer page, it is either (a) highly valuable to preserve in-game secrecy (meaning the details are either under a Campaign None, Campaign DuFr, or %%Secret%% tag) and there should be a short, in-game version of the page (b) not well-defined, but not highly valuable to have secrecy (in which case there isn't much on the page either way, as it isn't well defined) and the page is probably best as just a player facing "not much made up, here is what is known" (c) well-defined and not highly valuable to have secrecy, in which case the page is likely character-facing and outlines what is known in an "in world omniscient" perspective

11:47 AM

There might be a few other places in the Gezetteer where A or B apply (i.e. a country like Ursk or Deno'qai tribes) where it might be nice to have the "full details" under a %%^Campaign:DuFr%% or %%Campaign:None%% and a short, in-world rumors page as the main landing

11:45 AM

Cosmology hits both (A) and (B). I think something like the Feywild realms section of the Gazetteer hits at least (B)

11:45 AM

I think in-world style is really only valuable when (a) the number of pages is relatively low and there is some intrinsic fun in writing the in-world mysterious OR (b) there is high value in preserving in-game mystery and leaving answers to be discovered in game

11:43 AM

Yes, just landing



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 11:43 AM EST

i guess the other consideration is that the gazetteer is a lot of pages. i guess maybe you are thinking just region landing pages in the in-world style? i feel like most of the gazetteer is going to be written in more of a character-facing style than a true in-world style

11:41 AM

yeah

11:41 AM

basically write a largely in-world page, but have italicized call-outs



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 11:41 AM EST

Right, I didn't explore the idea of writing "in-world" with explicit callouts for "not invented but not mysterious"



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 11:41 AM EST

the other alternative is something like this that I put on the shadowfolds pages: (While there is more to say about the Shadowfolds, and significant lore likely exists, it largely has not been invented yet! - Eds.)

11:40 AM

but whether or not there is a significant population or an unusually low population of dwarves in cymea isn't a mystery, it just isn't decided



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 11:40 AM EST

Right. That was the problem I was running into trying to write satisfying pages for Gazetteer stuff where development is incomplete



**rsulfuratus**

02/02/2025 at 11:39 AM EST

cosmology is sort of the classic case for "people in world don't have access to the truth" so it works really well to just make undeveloped things in-world questions

11:38 AM

i think the problem with the in-world style is that it makes it hard to deal with the difference between in-world blank spots and just "not developed"

11:33 AM

I kind of prefer the player perspective for this



**Deciusmus**

02/02/2025 at 10:52 AM EST

Ignore a bit the actual details, i.e. Rostare refugees or dwarves rare in Cymea, I was just using those as various details to work in, don't intend them to be canonical or even semi-canonical.

10:50 AM

### **Style 2: "Player" Perspective** > Written for players, clearly stating what is known, unknown, and undeveloped. The region of Cymea and its surroundings is primarily home to humans, but other species are present in various ways. - **Elves**: They are rare in this region. Most elves originate from Orenlas, but there’s an idea that some elves from Rostare may have resettled here. This has not been fully defined yet. - **Dwarves**: There are probably significant dwarven populations around [[~South Cymea~]], but dwarves are rare in Cymea and practically nonexistent in the Skaer Islands. - **Lizardfolk**: The Latazso swamp on the western border is a major lizardfolk homeland, so logically, there are some lizardfolk in Cymea and further south. However, the specifics of lizardfolk in southern Cymea haven’t been determined yet. - **Humans**: Three major human cultures exist in this region: - the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], who mostly settle on the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]], but are common sights as mariners across the region. - [[Cymea]], a Drankorian province that had a significant maritime empire sometime before the [[Great War]] but is now in decline. This is a land of city-states and coastal towns without major political cohesion - [[~South Cymea~]], a poorly defined Drankorian province (or perhaps multiple provinces) that suffered greatly during the [[Great War]] and [[Blood Years]]. Some type of polity has emerged, but its exact shape is unclear, although its influence on [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], [[Tollen]], and [[Tyrwingha]] is minimal - **Stoneborn**: There’s no indication of a significant Stoneborn population here. - **Dangerous Wilderness**: This region is relatively settled, and most "dangerous wilderness" elements will probably be placed in **Drankorian Hinterland** or **Upper Istaros** instead.

10:50 AM

Lizardfolk are known to dwell in great numbers within the Latazso swamp on the western border. It is believed that many venture into Cymea and beyond, though their purpose and settlements, if any, remain unclear. Some say that the southern reaches of Cymea hold hidden lizardfolk enclaves, but no one can confirm this with certainty. The Stoneborn, if they have ever held a place in this land, have left no lasting mark. No known settlements of their kind exist here. As for true wilderness, the land is largely tamed, at least compared to the savage expanses of the **Drankorian Hinterland** or the **Upper Istaros**. While dangers certainly exist, the deep, untamed wilds seem to lie beyond these borders.

10:50 AM

### **Style 1: "In-World" Perspective** > Written from the perspective of a scholar or traveler within the world. The western [[Green Sea]] is home to many peoples, primarily humans and lizardfolk. Humans are, by far, the most numerous people of the region. The [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] have a long history in the [[Green Sea]] and although since the [[Great War]] they have mostly kept to themselves, Skaer sailors are commonly seen as far as [[Tollen]] and [[~South Cymea~|southern Cymea]]. [[Cymea]], once a powerful maritime empire, is in decline, and its numerous cities and coastal towns rarely exert influence beyond their borders. The lands [[~South Cymea~|to the south]], once a major [[Drankor|Drankorian province]], and later a trading partner with [[Isingue]], suffered greatly in the [[Great War]]. Although rumors of various squabbling realms have come north, few know what has emerged from the [[Blood Years]] there. The dwarves, known for their deep halls and mountain strongholds, are said to have a presence in the southern lands. In Cymea itself, they are scarce, and in the Skaer Islands, they are all but unheard of. Perhaps some secretive enclaves exist, but none have been recorded. Elves, while once more common, are now a rare sight. Most hail from distant Orenlas, but there are whispers of small communities of Rostare-born elves who may have found refuge here. If they exist, they keep to themselves, and few can say with certainty where they dwell.

10:50 AM

oof pasted kinda bad

10:49 AM

So I'm struggling with trying to come up with a tone for Gazetteer landing pages that I like. This is part of why I've been going in circles on defining stuff, because it is easier to hit the right tone with "well defined" or "totally rumors" than with "sorta defined". But here are two attempts (using "Civ and Culture for the Western Green Sea") one more "in-world", one more "player"

02/01/2025 at 6:25 PM EST

that's fair



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 1:42 PM EST

anyway, that's my overall feeling at the moment

1:41 PM

apporia and illoria is supposed to be a blank spot, so there shouldn't be an elven population there unless it becomes useful for a game

1:41 PM

but i like the perspective of focusing on cataloging blank spots, not filling them

1:40 PM

i think there are advantages of fleshing out details of history where the broad stroke are canonical, because it makes it easier to avoid accidently introducing continuity errors and it makes game prep faster

1:39 PM

i know you're at the show now, but i think my perspective is - sure this is interesting brainstorming but i am very reluctant to commit to anything at the moment. right now the currently running games are all focused on southern sembara and environs, or high level adventures in other planes apporia, vostok, and cymea are are interesting areas that are ripe for adventures. i don't want to overcommit to worldbuliding in advance of running a game. my feeling is i'm far enough behind on updating the vault to reflect (a) things that are canonical in game but haven't been clearly recorded, and (b) fleshing out details and making consistent/organizing of things that exist in broad strokes, that delving into quite tangential questions like "where else might elves live" is a bit distracting



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 11:29 AM EST

and I think it is better to have something in the nevos sea than to commit to survivors of ainumayra in tawir; I like the basic vibe of Ainumayra being "even the other elves don't really know what happened, this was a big disaster, most of the elves died, sure there were some refugees and whatnot that escaped, but ultimately most of the elves were not active participants in taelgar events after the conclave war"

11:27 AM

I put the elves down in apporia because the more I think about it, the more it feels like there really should be another elven place that isn't orenlas, the vibe of orenlas was never really "the last elven home"

11:24 AM

here is my map for dwarves and elves blue - elves (X = destroyed) (but the second elven kingdom is just an idea) pink - dwarves (X = destroyed, arrows = significant movement, dotted areas are places where it might actually matter for worldbuilding whether there are significant dwarven realms)

02/01/2025 at 11:02 AM EST

that is an intentional blank spot anyway so don't think it is worth putting anything there right way but can keep in mind

11:01 AM

right, if far enough south they could have just been outside the sphere of the major canonical events



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 11:00 AM EST

Doesn’t have to be isolationist, they could be a longstanding group of elves with a bit of a sailing vibe.

10:59 AM

I was thinking something in apporia could work - maybe the southern/illoria coast



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:59 AM EST

maybe actually elves are fine

10:59 AM

hmm. yeah. maybe better to leave the survivors of ainumayria open-ended



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:58 AM EST

Right. That commits to a certain “what happened to the survivors of Ainumayria” at least in part but that might be ok



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:58 AM EST

apporia also works but generally only for isolationist elves

10:57 AM

(i mean i think dreamhaven is also canonically something of an elven refuge)

10:57 AM

i was actually imagining it as a new elven realm, basically settled in the 1620s or something (would need to check the generation timing) by survivors of the conclave war who didn't flee to the feywild / turn their backs on humans / etc



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:56 AM EST

Tawir Forest could but it changes the hobgoblin narrative a bit - are the elves helping? Staying isolated?

10:55 AM

Yeah I agree



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:55 AM EST

tawir forest could work

10:55 AM

i don't think the elderwood works really well given the adventure there



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:55 AM EST

Or far east/south

10:55 AM

Or somewhere pretty marginal

10:55 AM

Unless it’s in the elder wood somewhere

10:54 AM

Elves don’t have a great place on the map for a second refugee



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:54 AM EST

as stoneborn canonically are at the edges of things anyway



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:54 AM EST

Yeah that’s fair



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:54 AM EST

lizardfolk imo likely need the most thought to make sure they are appopriately represented

10:54 AM

in general though i feel like dwarves are pretty well though out (as are halflings and elves for the most part, although elves could probably use a second canonical refuge so you have more options for where an elf comes from then orenlas or the ruins of ainumarya)

10:51 AM

so maybe there were dwarves in the mostreve hills a long time ago

10:51 AM

potentially pre-Downfall and not explored since then

10:51 AM

there is actually what might be a piece of a dwarven long road deep beneath a cave in addermarch



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:50 AM EST

but I don't know if that has to be right

10:50 AM

I dunno? I guess my view is that from the perspective of Sembara, the sentinels are where the "big underground" dwarven realms are, and everything else is pretty much "living with humans"



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:50 AM EST

probably a little unusual?

10:49 AM

hmm

10:49 AM

**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:49 AM EST

its just, "is it unusual that there are not dwarves in the mostreve hills"

i think for dwarves the history is not exactly clear. the gnomes left early on when the - at that time - primarily sentinel-based major dwarven empires started a big underdark campaign against far realm evils the downfall doesn't destroy the sentinels in the way it dries up the lizardfolk swamps and destroys the elven empires so maybe after the downfall there is a big expansion of dwarven realms, so you get some pretty far flung kingdoms. but i'm not sure it is decided and i'm not sure it needs to be?



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:46 AM EST

I think the zimka in general have always had a close relationship with the sentinel dwarven kingdoms

10:46 AM

The highland kingdoms in particular are quite dwarven, in my view.

10:45 AM

I guess there this question of whether the vibe should - oh there is a substantial mountain range, there are probably dwarves there but maybe not or - most dwarves live in the sentinels or kingdoms that spun off from the sentinels



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:45 AM EST

also for example the sembaran highlands might be much more dwarven than the lowlands

10:45 AM

e.g. longstanding dwarven connections and far enough away from the diaster of the sentinels to be less impacted

10:44 AM

actually possible it is relatively more dwarven

10:44 AM

cymea is undecided



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:44 AM EST

Is Cymea relatively less dwarven?



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:43 AM EST

right, i think that is correct and the vibe of dwarves is that, while they didn't suffer as much as the elves in the great war + aftermath, the biggest, most powerful dwarven kingdom was obliterated by a huge disaster



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:42 AM EST

(quite small comparatively means not necessarily absolutely small numbers, but the dwarves are always outnumbered by halflings and humans)

10:41 AM

I've been running sembara as the kind of place where dwarves have been slowly drifting into human communities from the sentinel kingdoms for 500ish years or perhaps more, long enough that some places have long established dwarven enclaves, but where also the numbers are always quite small comparatively, and generally with the feel of "expats" rather than natives



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:41 AM EST

canonically mawar has very few dwarves and the mawakel border mountains never hosted a significant dwarven population, but other than that they are basically everywhere

10:40 AM

right, although that doesn't have to be all there is, that is the vibe i invented for ulfgar frostbeard



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:40 AM EST

right, so basically relatively recent immigrates coming from "destroyed" places



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:40 AM EST

apporia, ardith, amani mostly



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:39 AM EST

where do the chardon dwarves come from?



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:39 AM EST

- plus the destroyed dwarven kingdom west of amani that can have had significant cultural impact in the north but is now part of the destroyed legacy of the pre-great-war kingdoms

10:38 AM

dwarves feel pretty complete, actually: - huge significant kingdoms across the sentinels - additional important and influential kingdom in yuvanti - chardon has a significant dwarven population - apporia did have lots of dwarves but they were mostly killed in the war of the dark rift, and the ones that survived are, in part, now scattered across the core of the chardonian empire - additional dwarves in the svarnjo mountains mostly living in the giant kingdoms

10:36 AM

going through the hobgoblin movements does make it seem like it would be worth going through the non-humans and thinking a bit about where they canonically exist and have influence, where the open spaces are, and whether any of them should be "reserved"



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:34 AM EST

Although perhaps lizardfolk should be thought of more like halflings and not usually or only found in “lizardfolk realms”

10:33 AM

But lizardfolk and dwarves actually seem somewhat lightly represented across the known world as well.



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:33 AM EST

but yeah i agree with the general idea

10:33 AM

right i was going to say i actually like stoneborn as not have a big impact on world events



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:32 AM EST

(For stoneborn specifically I don’t think it matters actually as they are kinda canonically on the edges of events)

10:31 AM

And to some extent it is better to decide something like… hrm there are too few stoneborn communities in the “core” known world and add one (even if poorly defined) then to have a bunch of other invention proceed without the stoneborn somewhere and then get kinda stuck with trying to decide why the stoneborn somewhere didn’t have any influence on history or culture



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:30 AM EST

sure

10:30 AM

right



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:30 AM EST

That is, say, there is clearly not a major stoneborn community in say the mostreve hills

10:29 AM

I agree but also I think it is good to know where the gaps are



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:29 AM EST

i don't think the region pages need to be considered complete - i think it is better to just catalog what has been invented and not feel obligated to make up a bunch of stuff just to fill gaps

10:28 AM

i don't want to make too many constraining decisions about stoneborn though because at some point someone will want to play one for a long campaign and it would be nice to leave space for player input

10:27 AM

oh, there were a lot of stoneborn living in the svarnjo mountains too

10:26 AM

(but could be)

10:26 AM

but it was never developed and isn't canonical

10:25 AM

at one point i invented a desert stoneborn variant (sandborn), in part for one of the early players in the great library campaign who dropped out about half way through



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:24 AM EST

Right.



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:24 AM EST

e.g. they can grow food in high mountains and don't feel the cold, etc

10:24 AM

the lore of stoneborn has always been that they can live in places others can't because ~magic~

10:24 AM

kate's guest character in the delwath solo was from a stoneborn community in the northern sentinels near the northern denoqai but whether that was a big community or just a few stoneborn living with deno'qai is unclear



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:23 AM EST

I was going through region main pages trying to at least fill in notes on civilizations in each region



**rsulfuratus**

02/01/2025 at 10:23 AM EST

but otherwise have not given it much thought. no one (besides nathaniel and zachary in aborted / non-canon games) has played a stoneborn as more than a guest character

10:22 AM

not in depth. there are a lot living in the southern sentinels, and a decent number in apporia



**Deciusmus**

02/01/2025 at 10:21 AM EST

Have you thought at all about how many stoneborn there are and where they might live?



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 5:17 PM EST

Yeah



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 5:16 PM EST

Right like 1682-1685

5:16 PM

Yeah I’ve always envisioned it as coming from either the north or the peninsula itself



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 5:15 PM EST

push it a bit later, so chardon is in its last expansionist phase, and then you have the combination of mawar being wary of invinting the chardonians in as well

5:14 PM

and really should probably not last 10 years, it should be a quick devasting war that crushes mawar before they can really even call for help. maybe chardon does help / send aid in the end but the damage is done

5:13 PM

it kind of makes me think the mindkinfe war should be something pretty weird, like aberrations emerging from the middle of the peninsula or something

5:11 PM

the only question then is why don't they get involved in the mindknife war? or if they do, why does mawar suffer so much?

5:11 PM

but it takes time for chardon to grow into the ability to win quickly and easily. by the 1670s they probably sweep up the last of the hobgoblins without much trouble

5:10 PM

right. i think the will is there and i think after the defeat of the shadow armanda there is a lot of popular sentiment in chardon that it is a grave moral failing to leave the people of the north coast suffering under hobgoblin rule (which, although gentle for hobgoblins, is not great)



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 5:10 PM EST

and then it repeats again only 10 years later, and this time chardon does better, etc

5:09 PM

and then in the 1640s the cycle repeats, with victories and then losses, but it is better nd faster



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 5:09 PM EST

i think the pysche of chardon is very much that the 1560-1600 period is kind of a freak out. this is when the society of the open scroll is founded, for example (1561)



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 5:09 PM EST

right. so it is more like... 1550s there is a fragile stalemate/peace and chardon is just thankful the hobgoblins don't move farther south because they are not sure they'd survive then you get some leader or movement in say 1608 that launches somekind of push, and maybe it succeeds fora bit but then fails and chardon falls back to the old fortified river line. and then in 1618 sometime tries again and this time there is a major victory, and some hobgoblin leader is killed, but it takes 5 more years of scrambling to stabilize the newly reclaimed terrority, and then the next kingdom almost overruns them, and so it takes 15 years before anyone tries again



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 5:07 PM EST

this would also be the first offensive war chardon fights basically ever; other wars are desperate defenses that end with a skin-of-the-teeth victoy (conclave) or a dramatic victory (shadow)

5:05 PM

i imagine that the 50-80 years of war against hobgoblins is when the now-famous chardonian legion and chardonian battle mages are forged and more-or-less invented / rediscovered

5:04 PM

the shadow armanda is a naval victory and chardon's first kind of "return to power" is as a maritime power

5:04 PM

chardon was not a major military power in the great war. they win against the dragons, but basically only because of the elves and some high level magic. possibly the conclave war leaves chardon dangerously exposed as many high level magic users die



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 5:03 PM EST

I mean, the rivers are well structured for a sequence of stalemates along these rivers



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 5:03 PM EST

i think it is the second



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 5:03 PM EST

Like, more specifically, what makes it take a long time? Does it feel like endless war? Is it more like hobgoblin kingdom X falls but the cost is high and there is a new fortified border, and 10 years of frozen conflict



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 5:03 PM EST

so there is a lot of fits and starts as chardon works to forge disjointed territory into a functional empire

5:02 PM

it is more like, you have a victory but you just don't have the people to fight again



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 5:02 PM EST

I'm not against it I just think it is worth considering the impact on psyche/history/etc of a long drawn out push of the hobgoblins out of the terriority



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 5:02 PM EST

i'm not sure i like that exactly. but chardon at this point is a new empire and the entire area has seen a generation of war and a lot of death



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 5:01 PM EST

against another?

5:01 PM

are the chardonians sometimes allying with one group?

5:01 PM

I guess I'm trying to figure out the vibe of a slow reconquest against hobgoblins, i.e. how "evil" are they?



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 5:00 PM EST

more like the 100 years war than the reconquista



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 5:00 PM EST

and just as many alliances between a little christian kingdom and a muslim one has christian vs muslim



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 5:00 PM EST

so you have a bunch of fits and starts and shifting terrain

5:00 PM

partly i'm envisioning that this is not one great hobgoblin kingdom fielding a single massive army for a decivise battle against Chardon. it is maybe 10 smaller hobgoblin kingdoms, in a shifting series of alliances



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 5:00 PM EST

yeah although a lot of fits and starts



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 4:51 PM EST

i mean the reconquista was like 700 years wasn't it?



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 4:51 PM EST

right, I guess I'm not totally sure why it takes ~2-3 generations to drive out the hobgoblins. But I guess plenty of medieval warfare is slow with lots of stalemates and slow advances and consolidation of gains and whatnot



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 4:45 PM EST

basically chardon is spain here, which doesn't emerge as a major mercantile power till after the reconquista

4:44 PM

possibly they help in some ways - maybe there is a joint mawar/chardon naval battle that destroys the hobgoblin navy at one point

4:44 PM

so mawar controls the seas and trade more or less

4:44 PM

chardon is spending all its energy slowly conquering north

4:43 PM

mawar emerges with the defeat of "central evil realm"

4:43 PM

looking at your questions. i think the mawar renaissance works quite well if you think about the Chardonian conquest north as a ~80 year process from 1600-1680 that involved a ton of resources and manpower



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 4:34 PM EST

can use clean up but should be roughly complete, pending some open questions (which could be better highlighted)

4:34 PM

pushed a draft of the west coast history framework note



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 4:20 PM EST

and my WIP Greater Chardon gazetteer main page

4:20 PM

I pushed a few small updates to the hobgoblin movements page



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 1:57 PM EST

No should have pushed everything



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 1:51 PM EST

are you actively working on anything? I have about 20 minutes and I was thinking of trying to write a bit more of the hobgoblin movements



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 1:46 PM EST

Should just lock the region borders layer so you cant accidentally draw on it



**Deciusmus**

01/31/2025 at 1:39 PM EST

I fixed it



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 1:33 PM EST

fyi i have a copy of the map where the region boundaries layer is not mesed up with the west coast history lines. can restore to that if it is too much of a hassle to carefullly erase the west coast stuff from the region boundaries



**rsulfuratus**

01/31/2025 at 9:35 AM EST

will try to push regularly in case you are doing any taelgar stuff today

9:35 AM

to the extent to which i have time today (might be a lot - very few meetings so unless i get a bunch of email to deal with a pretty light day), i'm working on fleshing out some backgorund notes, primarily two new notes i moved from brainstorming: - hobgoblin movements after cha'mutte - west coast history framework not really starting on a full fledged "Timeline of the West Coast" publishable note yet but instead trying to organize canonical facts vs ideas from long discussion



**rsulfuratus**

01/30/2025 at 9:58 PM EST

probably yes - i didn't really have the energy to go through and delete what feels settled but i think it is ifne to do. anything that feels like useful brainstorming can be copied to the discussions/brainstorming instead of deleted outright, but we always have it in the git history if needed



**Deciusmus**

01/30/2025 at 9:39 PM EST

is the dicssion in open questions worth keeping?

9:39 PM

with the caveat that in theory, that might only be true for Mos Numena but we don't have to decide given no other substantial religions exist whos secrets would be known by anyone

9:38 PM

just fixing a few typos and stuff; one thought... is it worth getting rid of settled open questions? for example I think you've pretty much settled the whole idea of "what are the incorporeal gods divine realms" by making them inaccessible to adventures/PCs and thus unimportant to decide



**Deciusmus**

01/30/2025 at 9:28 PM EST

I like the pandemonium page



**rsulfuratus**

01/30/2025 at 9:07 PM EST

it definitely takes a lot more time. but glad it came out well



**Deciusmus**

01/30/2025 at 9:06 PM EST

I think there are a lot of advantages of the in world writing style as it makes it easier to defer difficult "what is true" decisions and still make things feel "done"



**rsulfuratus**

01/30/2025 at 9:06 PM EST

i made the same landing page for background. it is pretty easy to copy over. haven't found a way to use variables in dataview queries but it only takes a minute to manually update



**Deciusmus**

01/30/2025 at 9:06 PM EST

its a really nice organization



**rsulfuratus**

01/30/2025 at 9:05 PM EST

didn't spend a ton of time on them

9:05 PM

but probably worth skimming the cosmology landing page and seeing if anything jumps out as a weak name in the "Staging" section

9:04 PM

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/30/2025 at 9:04 PM EST

I guess you did

9:04 PM

did you fix all the names?



**rsulfuratus**

01/30/2025 at 9:02 PM EST

cosmology is done. pushed the last update. pretty happy with how it turned out. might do a little more reorganizing of staging files and filling in a few details at some point. also happy for any feedback if you have suggestions anywhere. didn't tag anything as check/mike particularly but: - pandemonium - the entire planar concepts directory - spiritual realms, divine realms, and energy realms landing pages - heart of the mountain are probably most relevant to look over



**rsulfuratus**

01/30/2025 at 8:44 PM EST

if you feel like naming things these are the backlinks to pages in Cosmology that need names:

**Deciusmus**

01/30/2025 at 6:38 PM EST

But probably won’t do anything else tonight although maybe a bit when I get home

6:38 PM

I pushed a few minor cleanups that were pending

6:37 PM

No, I was busy all day at work and then tonight is Zachary’s winter concert



**rsulfuratus**

01/30/2025 at 6:37 PM EST

i'm nearly done with cosmology - just have two pages left to do and then some headers and organization - i'm not sure if i'll have energy or inclination to do any other worldbuilding tonight but in case i do did you start anything on the west coast history stuff?



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 10:42 PM EST

Anyway going to bed

10:42 PM

Alternatively something like The Green Coast The Fertile Coast The Gold Coast

10:41 PM

Not sure I like any of them

10:41 PM

For the north coast region in general… Lirae Verdinum Litus Aureum Caledria Arabic/northros Bahrica Yasir Rimila



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 10:39 PM EST

I think there is also nothing wrong with a few “Green River” or “Rushing River” type names

10:37 PM

I like Rafida and Qamira, which I would probably “chardonize” to Kamir or something



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 10:34 PM EST

What about Mizranis Rafida Darajum Kasira Badirum Qamira Wassid or Wassidi As river names?

10:29 PM

Primarily post-Drankorian not up north stuff

10:28 PM

Possibly for sites of battles or whatever

10:28 PM

These are mostly for provinces or other regions. Probably not rivers



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 10:24 PM EST

Don’t really like Veneros

10:23 PM

Lupentia is good too

10:23 PM

That said, I like Nemoris, Tarquina, Oscandria. Could be lots of Valandros-related names, plausibly, but generallly for old drankorian things

10:21 PM

Volganis and Amani are based on high school names so no linguistic derivation

10:21 PM

Voltara area naming is a mess and mostly not canonical but tends Italian which I’m not sure is correct

10:20 PM

Rivers have tended to be Semitic / Northros, but not always

10:19 PM

I forget what I used for kin-aska, I may have been thinking kind of Deno’qai northern

10:19 PM

These are towns/cities? I haven’t settled on solid naming conventions around Chardon. I think generally “Roman-ish” is fine although I’ve often trended more Italian in places (eg apporia). Lots of places in the north would potentially be akin to latinized Arabic or other Semitic names



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 10:15 PM EST

If you get a chance to flag any you particularly like/don’t let me know. I’ll tag everything name check anyway

10:10 PM

Lupentia

10:09 PM

Neracium

10:09 PM

Vastarno

10:08 PM

A couple of name ideas Veneros Tarquina Valandria (intentionally similar to Valandros) Nemora (or Nemoris) Vescarum Marcenium Oscandria Yeraetium



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 9:53 PM EST

but generally speaking should be without good reason to deviate

9:53 PM

i pushed my chasa river valley notes from onenote to brainstorming. mostly you didn't spend any time in cities so much of this kind of passed in a blur in the background and doesn't need to be strictly canonical



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 9:42 PM EST

Sure



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 9:42 PM EST

yeah, sounds reasonable. i may have some more comments / thoughts when it is all written out but am trying to finish the cosmology project asap so i can push a new taelgarverse saturday, and need to switch to session prep, so might not have time to do much more of this for a bit

9:40 PM

[]



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 9:39 PM EST

Canonical: - some kind of south valandros kingdom that is absorbed into Chardon - north east and north west valandros lightly populated - non drankorian realm on north bay coast Non canocial: - any details of the middle and north places (might make up some details on the place that is now part of Chardon heartland)

9:38 PM

Basic canonical points: - hobgoblins by sea to north Chardon - “bad thing” central attack on voltara - conclave war - end of bad thing is start of Mawar renaissance Non-canonical: - what the bad thing was and how it ended - what happened to the hobgoblins on north Chardon as they were defeated

9:36 PM

Ok I’m going to try to write up some of the non-yeraad stuff over tomorrow/Friday/Saturday



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 9:19 PM EST

Right



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 9:19 PM EST

(4) might have an interesting history, just an insular one



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 9:15 PM EST

Then there is something in 4, in between the red danger separating it from the coast and the oddities of (3), but it’s intentionally blank for now. But not part of Chardon and maybe not even drankoiran

9:12 PM

But (1) and especially (2) are the places with long interesting histories

9:11 PM

(3) doesn’t go well for ~reasons~ so it becomes kind of a lightly settled borderland, but plenty of people moved there or whatever so it isn’t empty

9:11 PM

(3) has not a lot of people but something Chardon wants. Which motivates the peaceful absorption of (1) and (2) and least in part

9:10 PM

Interesting

9:10 PM

Yeah actually that’s intent



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 9:06 PM EST

Maybe that region is not even part of the chardonian empire

9:06 PM

Yeah that seems right



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 9:05 PM EST

I think the lizardfolk have something to do with (4) vibes



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 9:04 PM EST

Then maybe 4 is just lightly populated? I’m not sure the (4) vibes

9:03 PM

Right



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 9:02 PM EST

The details don’t really matter

9:02 PM

I dunno. The vibes work

9:01 PM

Say, no one really knows what happened to the people.

9:01 PM

Could also be an area that was mysteriously empty after the Great War.

9:00 PM

Right. Doesn’t even have to be chaylte



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 9:00 PM EST

this area probably was conquered during the later expansionist phase for ~reasons~

9:00 PM

but i think the basic vibe of (3) being "something that is complicated by some complicated factor potentially involving giants or something" is sensible



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:59 PM EST

Right.



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:59 PM EST

sure, that could work. i'm not totally ready to commit to a specific idea especially involving chalyte as this may be quite relevant to the coming chardonian upheavals



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:57 PM EST

Who don’t really want Chardon to take the chaylte

8:57 PM

What if there are giants



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:56 PM EST

although would have to have problems for some reason or it wouldn't be worthwhile to go all the way north to voltara

8:56 PM

i kind of wonder if there is another chalyte source in the south mountains and that is the purpose of the city in (3)

8:55 PM

well, i would say (1) and (2) on my map, yes. (3) and (4) maybe not



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:55 PM EST

Either way the main idea would be that yeraad is a somewhat culturally unique area largely supportive of Chardonian rule but not really Chardonian culturally

8:52 PM

Right



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:52 PM EST

but the details don't really matter

8:51 PM

(1) is both ~75 miles closer to Kin-Aska and crucially south of the path of the invading army, which is clearly heading to chardon

8:50 PM

the conclave armies got within ~50 miles of chardon



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:50 PM EST

Wouldn’t refugees just flee toward Chardon?



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:50 PM EST

probably don't need much detail here, although eventually want names and more history, for the broad sweep post-Great War these are integrated peacefully during the period of consolidation and expansion between 1600 - 1640 roughly

8:49 PM

but culturally maybe distinct from (2). perhaps more drankorian, perhaps more culturally chardonian. maybe a substantial population of refugees from chasa river from conclave war who fled and never returned (Kin-Aska was completely destroyed, for example)

8:47 PM

i think (1) is likely fairly well integrated into chardon. this maybe has a similar story to Raziolo, the further west province in apporia

8:46 PM

and actually the vibe was always "chardon doesn't pay enough attention to our problems"



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:45 PM EST

Not really questioned or a problem. Maybe lots of poorer folks here join the army even



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:45 PM EST

right. canonically there was a lot of trouble with kobold raiders here



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:45 PM EST

So the legions and such are pretty welcomed ie when they are marching to Dunmar

8:44 PM

So kinda a happy to pay situation because Chardons a pretty competent overlord and is not that interested in forcing local politics to change



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:43 PM EST

right, sure



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:43 PM EST

Yeah I like that. Maybe the tax is more of a “protection” thing as well, ie the northern borders are not that safe



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:43 PM EST

although probably worshipping mos numena

8:43 PM

this could be "myraeni" / a more pure "original northerner" culture

8:43 PM

and culturally may be distinct from 1/3/4 too

8:41 PM

i think: (2) is dusty roads, and only nominally controlled by chardon. basically, they staff forts along the roads. maybe charge tribute in the form of some kind of tax. but culturally this really isn't chardonian

8:40 PM

although who is not clear

8:39 PM

alternatively 3 could be perfectly logical place for non-humans

8:38 PM

with 1 and northern part of 2 densest settlement

8:38 PM

but the exact borders could shift a bit

8:38 PM

something like: (1) agricultural, maybe olive growing (2) dry rocky hills, cattle ranching (3) ?? - highlands? not sure, imaging the eastern river here is rapid and non-navigable (4) river valley culture

8:37 PM

**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:35 PM EST

Then the section north of the yeraad along south of the hills is wetter and more agricultural

8:34 PM

If you play with the geographic a little bit you could have 3-4 pretty separate regions, ie maybe the land between the two rivers is kinda higher and you have a cattle culture in the hill lands between the rivers

8:32 PM

Yeah I was kinda thinking the same



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:32 PM EST

I’m kind of thinking the right vibe might actually several small fragmented cultures without much cultural or political cohesion

8:31 PM

Right running perpendicular instead of parallel to coast



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:30 PM EST

Right. But with slightly different mountain structure.



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:28 PM EST

but warm enough for year round growing - basically california

8:28 PM

the summer high pressure shifts over the yeraad to allows the monsoons, so this is definitely a dry summer, wet winter area

8:27 PM

spain and greece and parts of italy also work

8:26 PM

Chardon is supposed to have a kind of san francisco climate vibe

8:26 PM

the whole area is marked Csa

8:25 PM

the northeast part along the elderwood is clearly wetter and is maybe the most densely populated

8:24 PM

i could see the wedge between the two eastern tributaries as being pretty much texas hill country

8:23 PM

but the rest of the valley is probably not quite that dry

8:23 PM

the myraeni gap is very much texas hill country



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:22 PM EST

What’s the climate like?

8:21 PM

Right



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:20 PM EST

right. its also fairly big (300 miles by 200 miles, roughly) and doesn't need to be just one thing



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:20 PM EST

It feels like a good place for a kinda insular culture. Happy to have a sovereign overlord but kinda do their own thing



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:17 PM EST

so there would be contact but maybe not a lot of contact

8:17 PM

the myraeni gap is a natural barrier

8:17 PM

so maybe not a super dense or high traffic border

8:16 PM

but darba was a bigger border and songara wasn't founded

8:16 PM

right. at one point i had the idea that somewhat whatever was here actually triggered the western wars somehow. e.g. maybe got taken over by something evil or ???



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:16 PM EST

although perhaps not meaningfully so if the songra area was unpeopled and drankor was focused on the nevos sea/darba

8:15 PM

in the ?? period it would have been largely on the drankorian borderlands for a fairly long time

8:15 PM

So from a historical perspective, this would have been ?? -> drankorian -> some kind of post-drankor state -> relatively safe in great war / blood years -> somehow part of chardon



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:13 PM EST

yeah. maybe curving up a bit between the major swamps on the yeraad, but the basic outline is correct



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:12 PM EST

green is "yeraad river"

8:12 PM

yellow is core chardon

8:12 PM

blue is lizardfolk

8:12 PM

red is danger/no people

8:12 PM

where pink is illorian

8:12 PM

so you have something like this:

**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:11 PM EST

the one city is kind of placed as a mining town, although chardon mostly gets metals from lake valanadros hills, which are closer and have river transport

8:11 PM

but what is not clear, nor is how they came to be chardonian

8:10 PM

and this feels like it should have a pretty different culture / vibe than core chardon

8:10 PM

so it is really the interior area south of river, north of moutains, along the road connecting the two major cities that needs development

8:09 PM

if anyone lives between delta and mountains it is probably small illorian colonies, that type of thing. and the area with the windmill on the map is basically "core chardon", if undeveloped in detail

8:07 PM

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:07 PM EST

but you could imagine it as pretty heavily populated with lizardfolk



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:07 PM EST

the interior is maybe a bit like texas hill country

8:07 PM

but not too different

8:07 PM

and somewhat drier overall

8:07 PM

it's about 3 degrees further north



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:07 PM EST

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:06 PM EST

the mouth of the yeraad i've always imagined kind of like the mississipi delta



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:05 PM EST

I think it is useful for the yeraad to be culturally pretty disconnected from the nevos



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:05 PM EST

but you definitely have people on the north slopes

8:05 PM

in any case for whatever reason those mountains are supposed to be pretty uninhabited

8:05 PM

most of the mountains are imagined to closely approach the ocean so you get cliffs and not a lot of settlement. and also maybe giants or something that keep people from venturing too much

8:04 PM

not sure how far it extends so maybe some settlement around the mountains on the coast

8:04 PM

yeah i think that is close. the coast is imaged to be swampy with a big delta



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:03 PM EST

but not sure if that is right

8:03 PM

so from the map I'd guess the denset population is the yellow:

**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 8:03 PM EST

i guess 3 cities - one is in the hills

8:02 PM

there are really 2 cities. i'd consider anything northwest of the "south chardon hills" to be "core chardon/chasa" not yeraad



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 8:02 PM EST

but also it feels a bit separated from the coast

8:01 PM

so on the map there are a lot of cities and roads here

8:01 PM

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:59 PM EST

so the center of gravity of chardon shifted north

7:59 PM

but the swamps and rivers got moved around and this area got stretched in the current map

7:58 PM

in high school is was basically "core chardon"

![](../External/.deciusmus_media/rsulfuratus/820_1_1_image.png.7LUxLnWbO4.png)

7:56 PM

basically, originally this was just "core chardon empire" but that makes the core chardon empire too big in my opinion

7:56 PM

but the rest is in need of something clearer to put there

7:56 PM

in the modern day the area northeast of the chardon road is kobolds / ??? / scrubland / lightly peopled and fine to be ???



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:55 PM EST

as it implicates the whole illorian area/nevos sea/emerald coast

7:55 PM

its at a somewhat complicated geographic region



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:54 PM EST

although under chardonian control since they happily marched many legions through there

7:54 PM

yeraad in modern day is undetermined

7:54 PM

i think myraeni gap and the hilly region between the elderwood and the sentinels is lightly peopled and can be left as a obvious question mark



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:54 PM EST

what's it like in modern day?

7:54 PM

and would be unlikely to be left fallow

7:54 PM

right I guess safe farmland is in scare supply



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:53 PM EST

mostly just it is safe land and presumably a pretty good climate



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:53 PM EST

is there any reason there has to be a lot of people in yeraad? maybe its just lizardfolk



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:53 PM EST

there is actually an argument that the yuvanti mountains are raised by the baharzel as a refuge for the dwarves fleeing ardith



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:52 PM EST

sure



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:52 PM EST

i've never tried to square that circle. just handwave "its magic"



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:52 PM EST

although I guess there doens't have to be - darba isn't destroyed or damaged

7:51 PM

although presumably there is some disruption from the massive shocks of a huge mountain range appearing to the east?



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:51 PM EST

illoria is barely touched by the great war, which is in part how the end up controlling darba and large parts of apporia in the immediate aftermath



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:50 PM EST

right. that whole area has to be safe enough that the pirate kings of Castrella can make a living off trade through the canal



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:50 PM EST

illoria is a pirate kingdom but not immediately threatened by cha'mutte related dangers or other great evils

7:50 PM

chardon never feels pressure on its southeastern borders; darba/songara is the safest part of dunmar

7:49 PM

the problem with yeraad is it is canonically quite safe during the blood years

7:49 PM

i think brainstorming yeraad is more critical to getting the final layout of the west coast done in broad strokes than filling the remaiing holes to the north



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:49 PM EST

agreed



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:48 PM EST

but again nothing immediately in need of addressing

7:48 PM

there are a few other minor details (who/what lives in Tawir forest?)

7:47 PM

right. to a certain extent none of those need to be addressed to write a "grand sweep of history on the west coast" page



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:44 PM EST

and to a lesser extent: - who were the "middle blue" kingdoms on the northwest and northeast of valandros, and what happened to them during the northern renaissance? (only real canonical fact is that they can't get wealthy and prosperous enough to be major competitors to chardon in the 1670s/80s when voltara is being conquered)

7:43 PM

big unknowns are: - how did so many hobgoblins appear on the coast in late 1550s - what was the big scary in the middle volatara region and what killed it (presumably it going away triggers the Mawar renaissnace/end of mawar hiding)

7:42 PM

and survive to modern day intact from pre-great war

7:42 PM

the north two blue kingdoms (mawar and the other one) form the basis of the northern renaissance

7:42 PM

the middle two blue kingdoms could in theory just get crushed by the bad things on their borders. or they could survive to form the basis of whatever chardon later conqueors during the voltara conquests. either way, not too many people here really. these are lightly populated "refugee" lands, not proper surviving kingdoms



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:42 PM EST

Ie happy to be part of the empire

7:41 PM

That’s consistent, south valandros is “green”



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:41 PM EST

the blue "6" is the old post drankor F an largely survives to join chardon - i.e. after the conclave war some type of "mutual defense" alliance becomes a province or whatever. makes this "near Nahadi" a very early part of the empire like the chasa, not sure how that fits with your modern day vibes

7:40 PM

right so then in say 1560 or 1575 you have something like this:

2.24MB



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 7:35 PM EST

still some unanswered questions but this seems like a solid framework

7:35 PM

mawar renaissance in this history becomes a bit of a broader northern renaissance, basically a flourishing in the north while chardon is still bearing the brunt of the north coast hobgoblins or something (since the north is safe sooner than chardon is safe)

7:34 PM

the basic idea of the area stretching from north valandros coast to voltara is left relatively undeveloped but there is some bad thing here that causes destruction but is eventually defeated

7:33 PM

^specifically because it might take too long for hobgoblins to really settle here otherwise, but maybe not

7:32 PM

i think the idea of a hobgobin armada conquering the north coast probably needs a bit of magical help, but the basic logic works fine

7:32 PM

right, so i think the basic idea works well



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 7:26 PM EST

separately, the "conquest" hobgoblins land on the north coast

7:25 PM

this "something bad" is the source of all of the vague rumors in the Great Library game, and it doesn't have to be super canonical exactly what it is

7:25 PM

then "something bad" comes out of the cha'mutte army, not the conclave dragons, but something else. Could be a violent bunch of hobgoblins, could be orcs, could be a random mix of stuff. They break "yellow kingdom 2" (Amani) and whatever dwarven kingdom is in the mountains there, to the extent it has survived the great war

7:23 PM

as are whatever post-Drankorian realms are up the Chasa River valley (Kin-Asa, etc)

7:22 PM

When the Great War + Conclave War comes, yellow kingdoms 3 + 4 are completely wiped out.

7:21 PM

(Tawir Forest and north shore of lake valandros)

7:21 PM

then there are one or more scattered frontier provinces along the borders

7:20 PM

F is pretty closely aligned with Chardon

7:20 PM

Basically the story goes something like.... On the eve of the Great War you have - "yellow kingdoms 1 - 5" - mawar - "post drankor kingdoms A, B, C, etc" in particular you have a bunch of related minor kingdoms (call them A, B, C, D, and E) along the coast, as well as a fairly important post-Drankorian kingdom F in the Nahadi river valley

7:17 PM

Right so if you take my 1560 map, it maps pretty nicely onto your "current" map



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 6:50 PM EST

- Yeraad really needs some thought

6:50 PM

- history should provide reasons why green areas generally feel loyal and happy (this is already mostly accomplished)

6:50 PM

- blue areas are not in active conflict with Chardon; to the extent Chardon has been recently expansionist it is south (to Illoria) and east (into forests / Deno'qai)

6:49 PM

other details: - Chardon's conquest of Voltara is not a war against a strong, organized kingdom. my headcannon has always been kind of like conquering beorinlings or something - it is entirely possible the reason why Voltara feels like a frontier is some of the light blue area is hobgoblins / empty / dangerous; or, some of the light blue area is people who don't like chardon. but it is not densely settled

6:47 PM

light purple = Deno'qai

6:47 PM

red (D) = ruins of pre-Great War dwarves red (E) = ruins of pre-Great War elves pinkish = desolation / orcs / hobgoblins / whatever (no civilizations) blue = thriving non-Chardonian cultures green = "core" of Chardonian Empire, mostly quite loyal light blue = "frontier" of the Chardonian Empire. Voltara very much a garrison town with a fractious local population; lake valandros coast less clear what it is black = ?????

6:45 PM

here is a rough outline of current west coast vibes

**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 6:31 PM EST

so these were presumably destroyed during whatever wiped out amani

6:30 PM

which reminds me, another consideration: there is a big dwarven ruins underneath the mountains separating voltara from the coast, but no dwarves

6:30 PM

(2) handouts from very early in the great library campaign, no need to be canonical

(1) a story told by a bard who lives alone in the mountains north of Voltara (not Chardonian) Azzan - northlander hero Ikos - Chardonian friend Fought together in the Great War against Cha'mutte, great friends. But soon after the war, in the chaos as the hobgoblins poured from the north, Chardon abandoned the Northlanders, seeking to protect their borders. Despite Ikos' pleas, Chardon did not come to their aid and many died. Now, Chardon has come back but in front of an Empire, instead of allies. (could be metaphor / retconned)

6:19 PM

i'm home so dumping a few great library notes here



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 6:18 PM EST

Afk for a bit

6:17 PM

this makes the destruction up north a little less wholesale - sure "yk 2 and 3" get wiped out by some terrifying whatever but it isn't exactly like there are these endless hobgoblin wars that mawar is staying out of

6:16 PM

in the 1590s, something happens that wipes #2 off the map, mostly.

6:15 PM

the #1 strand conqueors most of the post drankorian kingdoms, but has a frozen border with chardon (in south) and active borders with two surviving post-drankor kingdoms in blue

6:14 PM

in the early 1550s the #2 and #3 groups wipe out "Yellow Kingdoms" 2 and 3. (4 was already gone due to original cha'mutte armies)

6:14 PM

basic idea: three hobgoblin strands as discussed. #1 - conquest strand. arrives by sea. exact route undetermined but they land on the north coast late 1550s +/- #2 - death and violence strand. might not be purely hobgoblins, could be orcs? something else? cause of the war which destroyed Amani #3 - conclave war strand

6:12 PM

Ok here's a new idea:

**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:52 PM EST

Second there is kind of a vibe of “everyone do what they need to survive” which makes Mawar again not exactly a hero but also not unusual

5:51 PM

Two thoughts: nothing has to say Mawar was great allies with the interior northern kingdoms pre Great War. So vibe is maybe less “Mawar abandonded allies” and more “Chardon and Mawar retreated and left the north to fight alone”



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:48 PM EST

yeah me neither



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:48 PM EST

I’m not convinced Mawar leading the fight is the right vibe

5:47 PM

But could fit into almost any war

5:46 PM

FWIW this is also supposed to be on the shores of lake valandros: [https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/mace-of-terror-vision/](https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/mace-of-terror-vision/ "https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/mace-of-terror-vision/")



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:46 PM EST

I'm not sure I like the mawar leading the fighthonestly



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:45 PM EST

Hmm. Maybe. Also i think the lake valandros hills are a good place for lots of ruins and such so probably that would imply pushing the light blue southwest and the brutal hobgoblins southeast



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:45 PM EST

and are the key people in the coalition that defeats them

5:44 PM

One idea: maybe Mawar drops the fog to lead the fight against the brutal/violent hobgoblins



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:43 PM EST

A few other considerations: - conquerors here would presumably have a strong navy initially, but this has to disappear for Mawar renaissance to make sense - this puts Mawar in a slightly different light, basically abandoning the light blue people



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:43 PM EST

not sure what makes the brutal hobgoblins go away but you could end up with 2 or 3 human cultures regrouping after they vanish, and looking to Mawar as the main cultural touchstone in the region

5:42 PM

then you have the brutal/violent in the middle and human refugees fleeing in the blue

5:42 PM

slight tweak: (making the conquerers on the southwest shore of lake valandros)

**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:36 PM EST

right, sure, that works too

5:36 PM

the west hobgoblins come to the north coast from the sea, bypassing whatever human settlements there are on the north coast



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:35 PM EST

I was actually going to propose basically that except the center group does not join conclave war



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:35 PM EST

the east hobgoblins are the Conclave true believers and march south

5:35 PM

basically make there be 3 strands: - west - center - east The center hobgoblins are less enthralled to the dragon Conclave and kinda stop along the way and maybe fight some wars against the humans and settle for a while before being pushed out. But fundamentally Chardon only encounters them as part of the Conclave War (but they are the key enemy in the "unnamed war that destroyed Amini) and also maybe the key group that still exists around the north of voltara/west of fens

#1 A - split is far north, head west and sail directly south #1 B - split is far north, head west, stop on the big island off mawar, then go south #2 A and B - similar, but not so far north #3 go from voltara area direct #4 settle in voltara for a while then go direct

5:26 PM

that outlines I think the 4 options to get hobgoblins to the north chardon coast



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:26 PM EST

possibly in the non-quite canonical war that chardon doesn't help with



**Deciusmus**

but amani (yellow kingdom 2, on the voltara plains) is completely destroyed

5:25 PM

so they need to survive somehow the early hobgoblins

5:25 PM

the coastal region is probably not part of the chardonian empire at the moment and is likely a non-drankorian culture

5:24 PM

the vibe has also been that voltara is a frontier, and that the long road to lake valandros is fairly dangerou



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:24 PM EST

Right; those coastal cities work well as the remains of yellow kingdom 5, and a big tradiing partner with mawar during the renaissance



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:24 PM EST

but there is nothing really north of voltara except orcs, hobgoblins, and kobolds

5:23 PM

in the Great Library campaign, there is human settlement south of Voltara, and possibly non-Chardonian cities along the coast

5:23 PM

possibly. or whatever is there



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:23 PM EST

you mean against the human kingdoms in voltara region?



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:22 PM EST

it is likely / possible that chardon is fighting some other wars at this point



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:22 PM EST

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:22 PM EST

the exact dates of the mindknife wars could be adjusted slightly, but this should be into chardon's newly expansionist era where it is starting to look to secure chalyte resoruces

5:21 PM

right



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:21 PM EST

along that southern blue road

5:21 PM

and chardon is busy building a road through the Tawir gap instead of helping

5:21 PM

then imagine the Mindknife War is something from the north, i.e. the two blue arrows pointing at Mawar:

01/29/2025 at 5:21 PM EST

for lake valandros, i think that the east coast is caught up in the conclave war and was historically probably elven or denoqai anyway, and can be left relatively open-ended

5:20 PM

right

5:20 PM

this picture still leaves the history of the voltara area south through lake valandros northern coast pretty undeveloped (basically, 1, 2, and 5 of the yellow kingdoms)



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:19 PM EST

5:19 PM

i.e. the hobgoblins in the north chardon coast are really the last danger in the area, in a way



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:18 PM EST

right, that is where I was going next

5:18 PM

i think that tells a nice story about the chardonian empire and the relatively well developed parts of history (chasa river / elderwood / elves; apporia; mawar; north chardon coast), pending the questions about the hobgoblins



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:18 PM EST

For the Mawar renaissace to really work, you actually want voltara and the north bay coast to be relatively safe by the early 1600s

5:17 PM

Right



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:16 PM EST

right, i think there is a nice arc where: (a) conclave war nearly results in destruction of chardon and terrifies people (b) chardon is isolatist for a while, basically growing up the river but neither a naval or major military power (c) umbral convenant / war of the dark rift forces them to rearm, and find they are strong (d) after freeing apporia the obvious next step is the hobgoblins



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:15 PM EST

Details and reasoning honestly doesn't have to be worked out, but it doesn't seem like a hard problem to solve. For the history page I was basically going to write a "Early Imperial Expansion Era" that is basically Apporia + North Chardon coast, 1600-1650, with pretty vague details

5:14 PM

and it becomes very popular to start seeing the empire as the savoir of all these scattered people. So the north chardonians, who are after all still (a) alive and (b) Drankorian become this cause that cannot be abandoned

5:13 PM

I'm envisioning something like the smashing defeat of the Umbral Conventant teaches Chardon it is strong



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:13 PM EST

right, that is probably the most straightforward



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:12 PM EST

Right. The 3rd bullet could pretty easily just be "finally strong enough" via the successful Apporia campaign



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 5:12 PM EST

right, got distracted by work, my basic thought is: (1) what happens up north 1545-1560 can be left blank (after all human historians might not know much about it, although perhaps rumors/minor details of the war that i tentatively invented for Great Library exist) (2) conclave war timeline is basically settled, as this was largely developed for the chasa river / elderwood arc anyway. it is the conclave war that destroys elven kingdoms and spans shattered ice, etc. (3) there are three key events that affect the western hobgoblins, which are currently unknown in nature but have clear impacts: - in late 1550s,+/-, something leads hobgoblins to advance south, probably through the tawir forest / mountains gap, starting an advance that is ended by a stalemate with chardon sometime in the late 1550s, perhaps. - there is something that changes the dynamic between mawar and hobgoblins that allows the mawar renaissance to flourish starting in the 1590s - there is something that changes the dynamic betwen chardon and the hobgoblins that causes chardon to launch a series of campaigns north, eventually defeating the hobgoblins (exact timing unclear, but shouldn't start before 1600 and shouldn't end after ~1650 or so, most like)



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 5:04 PM EST

(My preference is b but I don't have a strong idea as to what that could be)

5:03 PM

or (c) Mawar to never have been worried about the hobgoblin empire per se, but to have other reasons to stay in the fog in 1570s but not by 1590s

5:03 PM

then, you need either (a) Mawar to open up earlier (I think not great for the Mawar timeline) or (b) something to change by the 1590s so that the hobgoblin empire doesn't seem as much of a threat as it was in the 1570s

5:01 PM

that kinda leaves Lake Valandros and north as a "no mans land" and easy to leave blank for whatever we want to show up there later

5:01 PM

so in 1565 you have: (a) a relatively large hobgoblin empire stretching all along the north coast (b) formally at peace with Chardon (c) which has defeated the Conclave hobgoblins and is rapidly expanding up the chasa river (d) some scattered humans - perhaps even a coherent kingdom - in the coast of the north bay (e) the defeated conclave hobgoblins licking their wounds to the east

4:59 PM

and you end up with a bit of frozen conflict, like in sembara

4:59 PM

in 1565 or so some battle is fought perhaps along one of the unnamed rivers (farthest south one?) that halts the advance

4:58 PM

by late 1550s the "unnamed west" hobgoblins are moving south (for potentially unclear reasons) and methodically conqueor the north chardon coast

4:57 PM

(b) delays the "Unnamed West" hobgoblins (c) wipes out all of the human realms although potentially not (yellow kingdom 5) and potentially not all of the humans (i.e. some scattered refugees are potentially around to form new kingdoms to be conquered by chardon)

4:56 PM

Right so basically whatever is going on up north 1545 - 1560 it (a) spawns the conclave wars



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:53 PM EST

there is a bunch of tentative history from the Great Library campaign, involving Airion the Mistspeaker (who shows up a lot in various places immediately pre Great War) and a hint of a war that the people in kingdom 2 at least, maybe 1/2/5, fought and lost against hobgoblins where they were angry that chardon didn't come to their aid

4:50 PM

my feeling is the most likely reason for the delay is actually that hobgoblins set up an early hobgoblin kingdom in Voltara area, more or less

4:49 PM

but it isn't like the blackwater fens is great agricultural land either

4:49 PM

a side point is that when cha'mutte dies there is a major kenku revolt in pandar. and without magic pandar probably becomes pretty inhospitable, certainly not a place that can support anything close to the popuation density living there in the 1530s or whenever

4:47 PM

so i think the most likely starting point is that, when the Great War ends in 1545, Pandar effectively covers the "Cha'mutte arrows", the forest of dreams, and "kingdom 4"

4:46 PM

but actions of the high school campaign force an accelerated timeline so just dumps a bunch of hobgoblins in the pass via magic shadow portals

4:46 PM

a reasonable story is that cha'mutte is originally intending to move the north army south and the south army north to conquer both sides of ulrich pass for whatever reason the "monastery" is so important to the kill the gods goal

4:45 PM

so the yellow "kingdom 4" is already subjugated or destroyed

4:44 PM

also, keep in mind that by 1545, Cha'mutte has already conquered probably as far south as the blackwater fens

4:44 PM

right but that isn't going to delay them for 5 years or whatever



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 4:44 PM EST

it also makes it easier for "who knows" type answers - they appeared on the coast.

4:43 PM

that could work too, although the "go around mawar" could be a reason they are delayed compared to the conclave war



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:43 PM EST

in my original map i have them coming across the bay and through the gap between tawir forest and the mountains



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 4:42 PM EST

what if they sailed across the north bay, tried to land in mawar, were pushed away by the fog, and made their away around to the north chardon coast

4:42 PM

I half wonder if they didn't come from the ocean



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:42 PM EST

i think it implies there is some kind of split early on in cha'mutte's armies basically as soon as cha'mutte dies

4:41 PM

so then if we look at this map

4:36 PM

N = northern army splits into 3 = shattered ice, still around 4 = ???

4:36 PM

S = southern army splits into 1 = iron fang (still around) and 2 = bitter knife/blackened claw (defeated by dunmar)

4:33 PM

so I think it is somthing like this:



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:29 PM EST

however, you don't ever really get hobgoblin settlement on the eastern side of the west coast (the "Conclave War" path). in part because the Conclave War is in some sense a war of revenge against the elves/humans/Chardon and is intentionally destructive, in part because Chardon wins much more decisively in the end

4:29 PM

right



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 4:28 PM EST

+ northern plaguelands (Iron Fang)



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:28 PM EST

in the immediate aftermath of the Great War, however, you have three major areas of hobgoblin settlement: - Chardon north coast (??? tbd) - southern Greater Sembara (Shattered Knife) - Nashtkar / western plaguelands area (this is where Bitter Knife and Blackened Claw hobgobilns come from)


**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:26 PM EST

(plus the realm on Irrla)

4:26 PM

yes. so basically to date, the canonical hobgoblins are mostly either (a) hiding in the plaguelands doing their thing, or (b) scattered, small groups eking out a living marginal terrain around the edges of the sentinels, which based on my very very very old notes is more or less a return to the pre-Great-War status quo except with the hogoblins weaker and more disoganized



[**rsulfuratus**](#1334271748815851590)The only things we are sure of about the west advance is it lagged the conclave war for some reason, it was less destructive (more conquering, less dragonfire), and it took a while for Chardon to gain strength to win a series of campaigns



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 4:22 PM EST

Right

4:21 PM

the "southern sentinel" ones are the descendants of the Shattered Ice clan

4:21 PM

then separately, there are known hobgoblin settlements in the plaguelands ("Iron Fang -> mad scientist, but they are keeping to themselves brewing challenges for a level 18 party) and in the southern sentinels just soth of urlich, in the headwaters of the Yeraad River and probably in the spur stretching out towards Maseau



[**rsulfuratus**](#1334271475775180811)So to go back to west coast history, a major decision point is are there hobgoblins here now. Since that will determine history of the western advance



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 4:19 PM EST

Right. I think the whole "post cha'mutte" hobgoblin stuff is pretty settled except: where did the blackened claw clan that fought around Raven's Hold come from? what happened to the "west north" branch who were not part of the conclave war



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:19 PM EST

**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:17 PM EST

Currently maybe hiding in small bands in marginal terrain in the sentinels and occasionally raiding but clearly significantly reduced in impact and power. And also maybe in conflict with whatever east sentinel hobgoblin clans managed to hide from cha’mutte



[**rsulfuratus**](#1334270963419709541)This is basically the group that flees the conclave war defeat

4:15 PM

But yes, to answer your question, all 3 hobgoblin wars were shatted ice

4:15 PM

in some earlier conversations the stone titan one-shot was in the opening wars of the 1st hobgoblin war, where the hobgoblins were allied with mind flayers

and move into the foothills of the sentinels, lick their wounds, and then cross near urlich to attack dunmore area

**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:14 PM EST

So all three hobgoblin wars are same group on sembara?



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 4:12 PM EST

The semi-canonical view is: **Southern army becomes Iron Fang + Bitter Knife** Iron Fang is defeated quickly by Sembara but only partially, and becomes the mad scientist plagueland hobgoblins (who are still around) Bitter Knife has a longer series of wars against Dunmar, but is defeated more throughouly **Northern army splits into 2 branches, the "western north" branch and the "eastern north" branch** Eastern north branch is the key troops of the conclave war. Defeated by Chardon in the 1550s/1560 timeframe they regroup and push west over the mountains into Sembara in the 1570s to be the first hobgoblin war in Sembar western north tbd



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:12 PM EST

Currently the world vibe in ongoing campaigns has not had major hobgoblin wars as a theme, so they are probably pretty scattered but not likely extinct

4:11 PM

Which also plays into west coast history

4:11 PM

A related point: where are hobgoblins now?

4:10 PM

dated way back the original idea of the "Blood Years" was basically, Cha'mutte is defeated but his armies are not, so this all works well, but the exact movements are a little ambiguous at the moment and fairly important to post-Great War history of the west coast



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 4:09 PM EST

So I just was reading up on this in various chats/docs



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:09 PM EST

(1) It is probably useful to sketch out a little more clearly the "state of play" w/r/t hobgoblins in 1545. the major concentrations of Cha'mutte's armies are in the Dunmar/Isingue border area, and in Pandar, with scattered concentrations elsewhere. a part of the southern armies (Iron Fang) move quickly against Sembara and are defeated in the Bloodlust War the rest of the southern armies establish on the eastern frontier of Dunmar and are involved in a series of wars from 1550s - 1610 the northern armies are canonically larger and also potentially more desparate, as one must presume that pandar does not have the agricultural capacity to feed a large army without magic. the shattered ice clan moves against sembara across the mountains in the 1570s in some notes (timing is around 1st hobgoblin war), but in other notes the shattered ice clan is not involved in the 1st hobgoblin war. there is a semi-canonical idea they were somehow pushed over the mountains by chardonian expansion but i'm not sure the geography works super well.



**rsulfuratus**

01/29/2025 at 4:01 PM EST

I'm pretty busy today but a few quick thoughts



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 3:48 PM EST

Unclear: * What is happening in the Yeraad river

3:48 PM

The following things should not have happened yet: * Chardon absorbs/conqueors the North Chardon coast, Lake Valandaros, of Voltara

3:47 PM

By the end of this period, the following things need to be true: Mawar feels safe enough to dismiss the fog Chardon starts to become truly imperial, absorbing the Approian provinces in the aftermath of the War of the Dark Rift

3:44 PM

Here's the version I have so far, slightly modified from last night, and trying to leave the right "blank spaces" while still being a solid framework. **Great War and Blood Years** In Chardon this is basically 1545 - 1597 (the defeat of the Umbral Covenant being the conventional "end of the Blood Years") in Chardon at least. There are a couple of major things happening here: 1548(ish) - 1558(ish): Conclave War. Wipes out all human civilizations north of Lake Valandros and east of the coastal mountains, although it doesn't necessarily kill all the humans. 1550s - 1560s: Hobgoblin advance. Methodically moves south along the North Chardon Coast. 1545 - 1590ish: Mawar fog/isolation. 1559 - 1584: Apporian pirate kingdoms 1584 - 1597: War of the Dark Rift post 1560: settlement of Chasa River valley by Chardonians



**Deciusmus**

01/29/2025 at 3:35 PM EST

I've been working too much today so taking a little break to think some more about Chardonian history... it wouldn't do to work the entire day on work...



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 10:47 PM EST

Yeah it seems to all roughly fit nicely on a high level



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 10:47 PM EST

Anyway going to bed. But might mess around tomorrow depending on my workload

10:45 PM

And the voltara expansion(last) is clearly for chaylte

10:45 PM

Whatever the exact timing, the expansion towards the north coast is clearly “saving them from hobgoblins” whereas the lake expansion is less clear

10:44 PM

But Mawar and Chardon are still separated by the hobgoblins along the north coast, and kinda growing independentally. Chardon starts a series of expansions

10:43 PM

By ~1595 Mawar sees hobgoblins as relatively weak and the Mawar renaissance starts. Chardon also has grown but now and see itself as a strong power for the first time when it crushes the umbral convent

10:42 PM

Maybe a few small skirmishes and reclamation of some territory along the coast

10:42 PM

1570s-1590s are basically growth in the Chasa River valley. With hobgoblins still along the north coast but in some kind of holding pattern/stalemate

10:41 PM

Between 1556 and 1565 or whatever Chardon fights to major wars (expansionist hobgoblin and conclave), but is exhausted after that

10:40 PM

Then hobgoblins come south, bypassing yellow 5 for whatever reason (and Mawar because of mountains + magic fog)

10:40 PM

Right but that all fits. Basically the idea is— yellow kingdom 5 survives along the coast during the conclave war - basically as the only survivor of northern non-Drankorian kingdoms.



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 10:38 PM EST

(other than the voltara vibe)

10:37 PM

(but no details exist about this culture)

10:37 PM

however, voltara has always in the great library game been an isolated frontier with most of the population density actually to the west, basically along the coast in "yellow kingdom 5", which I think is definitely not ever chardonian



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 10:37 PM EST

(AFK fora bit)



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 10:35 PM EST

lake valandros and yeraad being undetermined as i'm not yet clear who actually lives there now

10:34 PM

whereas the voltara area does not - chardon is much more of an imperial power here

10:34 PM

the modern day vibe that is important to keep is that the north coast, chasa, and apporia are all basicaly loyal imperialists and still think of chardon as their saviors

10:33 PM

actually the hobgoblins maybe get cut off a bit at this stage. still harass chardon to south (and east?) but mawar renaissance reinvigorates the north, e.g. the "remnant yellow kingdoms"

10:33 PM

right. mawar is protected by mountains via land, and can easily posulate that mawar is by far the better navy than hobgoblins



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 10:32 PM EST

As long as the hobgoblins are hemmed in somehow, not expansionist

10:31 PM

Which I think is ok actually



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 10:31 PM EST

so that puts mawar renaissance at the same time as "hobgoblin kingdoms to the south"



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 10:31 PM EST

Right that was in your notes



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 10:30 PM EST

there is a bit of tension here since my original idea (which you either independently invented or was in notes somewhere) is that it takes chardon a long time to get strong enough to break the hold of hobgoblins on the north coast



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 10:29 PM EST

Without changing the dates of the Mawar renaissance at least

10:29 PM

I don’t think the north coast can be incorporated earlier than 1650s

10:29 PM

North coast matters re: Mawar

10:29 PM

Or rather incorporated



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 10:28 PM EST

this is when incorporated into chardonian empire



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 10:28 PM EST

I think for the grand scheme of historical eras it doesn’t matter when lake valandros or Yeraad is settled necessarily



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 10:28 PM EST

but maybe swapping Valandros and North Coast

10:28 PM

in my head the current day empire is basically 6 pieces: Apporia Chasa Yeraad North Coast Valandros Voltara with an order of: Chasa -> Apporia -> Valandros -> North Coast -> Voltara (with Yeraad unclear)



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 10:26 PM EST

The big thing is that Chardon can’t be a powerful force on Mawar doorstep until the 1650s-1680s

10:25 PM

Basically I was taking the Mawar and aporia history as canon and trying to figure out how that fits with Chardon



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 10:25 PM EST

the big unsettled things are the lake valandros area and the yeraad river valley

10:24 PM

yeah



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 10:24 PM EST

That actually lines up with my timeline almost exactly



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 10:23 PM EST

(the dates don't have to be exactly right)

10:23 PM

e.g.: Current magistros, [[Mitus Verina Auratan]]. Comes from a powerful family; his aunt, Seva Auratan, was magistros before him, and her grandfather discovered chalyte in the north making the family super rich. Timing: Seva dies (aged 71), Mitus becomes Magistros: 1746 Mitus born: 1725 Seva becomes Magistros: 1720 Appius dies: 1703 First chalyte mines in north established; Voltara garrison built: 1680s Seva born: 1675 Seva's grandfather discovers chalyte in north: 1671 Appius Auratan (Seva's grandfather) born: 1620 So, basically, the Auratan family in the mid 1600s is not particularly notable. Appius Auratan, Seva's grandfather, has some magical training (perhaps retired from the mage guard) and is a bit of an adventurer, and makes the discovery of rich chalyte lodes in the mountains near what is now Voltara. Returns to Chardon and with the profits of his first haul starts a mining company.

10:22 PM

there are some significant details in various of my notes in various places, and also some unwritten notes on modern day chardonian empire that may determine how history plays out.



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 10:10 PM EST

I am about to go to bed, but I've been messing around with Chardonian history, specifically trying to write a unified narrative that works with the Conclave War, Apporian history, and Mawar History. Here is what I have so far: #### The Great War and the Blood Years DR 1540 - DR 1574 Although the [[Great War]] ended in DR 1545, the vast army of [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] and other terrors that [[Cha'mutte]] had amassed did not simply disappear. Over the next 30 years, two major wars were fought across the lands north of Chardon: the [[Conclave War]] and the to be named war against the hobgoblins. basic idea: conclave war then in the 1560s a series of expansion of hobgoblins, stopped in 1561 or 1562, but not really peaceful - next 10 years are back and forth along the north chardon coast; but in 1574 some type of armistace line is drawn, splitting (or even leaving the hobgoblins with most of the coast). Perhaps there is another human kingdom involved here (the "yellow 5 kingdom from other maps"?) in the north, pincering the hobgoblins a bit. chardon is settling chasa valley here #### Early Imperial Era DR 1574 - DR 1597 During mawar renai; hobgoblins are stilla round the malakel entrance, but somewhat hemmed in by something in the north so don't really have a good expansion plan; perhaps even being somewhat decent rulers in a way; chardon growing in the chasa valley but not really an empire just yet DR 1597, when the Umbral Covenant launches the Shadow Armada to conquer Chardon, and loses badly - awakening moment - empire is working this is not like the conclave war at all leads to first serious wave of expansion #### Imperial Expansion DR 1597 - present three phases: apporia - 1597 - 1610 1650 - 1675 - conquest of hobgoblins; (mindknife war just after this) * 1690 - 1710 - chaylte



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 8:25 PM EST

(but not everything has to be organized the same way)

8:25 PM

i think what i'm going for will be obvious once i finish and push everything. basically, imo, staging is for pages that definitely exist but which don't have any text. if there are a bunch of dm notes, i'm moving them to the correct folder with excludePublish["all"]



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 8:22 PM EST

sure; I like staging as a landing zone for basically pages that are created to have a place for brainstorming/thoughts/etc but that are not really ready yet



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 8:11 PM EST

(might not get to any of this tonight)

8:10 PM

(also with excludePublish"all"

8:10 PM

i'm also going to make a ["meta"] cosmology landing page that will have all the notes in staging linked from cosmology, as well as some general guidance on tagging and categorization for the folder.

8:09 PM

mostly doing non-taelgar stuff tonight, but a brief comment, trying to finalize the cosmology folder. i'm generally leaving things in (or moving to) staging if there both no invented in-game detail and no relevant dm notes (e.g., the sun) i'm leaving things as player-facing stubs, with excludePublish["all"], if there are relevant dm notes even if there is no player facing text (e.g., the moon, the stars)



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 6:26 PM EST

ok, I pushed completed Far North, Far South, Eastern Green Sea landing pages



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 6:18 PM EST

i'd probably just link to green sea page



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 6:18 PM EST

how much do you think it makes sense to put the general climate of the green sea on the eastern and western pages, or should I just add a climate sectio on the Green Sea page and link?



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 5:34 PM EST

I don't think it really has



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 5:34 PM EST

i'm not sure that current map has ever had much of an impact on worldbuilding

5:33 PM

the climate of the landmasses (Mawar, north Apporia, Chardon coast) is canonical. why the climate is the way it is is not



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 5:31 PM EST

is that canonical, i.e. that there is something out there that impacts the climate/currents/etc of the near Endless Ocean?

5:31 PM

here is a question: the current climate of the western Endless Ocean is heavily influenced by the existence of the sayuna islands, which diverts the major currents far to the north and south, and makes the main coast something like the Tasman Sea between australias and new zealand



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 5:26 PM EST

i did all the easy planes already



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 5:26 PM EST

my current solution is just to move on to a different region



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 5:25 PM EST

i have a bit of a related problem with the shadowfolds - there is not much invented about them, almost nothing compared to e.g. energy realms or feywild, but they are not intentionally mysterious like e.g. some of the "outer planes" or the far realms. my current solution is sticking this at the bottom: *(While there is more to say about the Shadowfolds, and significant lore likely exists, it largely has not been invented yet! - Eds.)



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 5:09 PM EST

the hardest regions to write are the two "mostly populated" regions that are not well characterized yet: Northwest Coast + Western Green Sea

5:09 PM

Or to put it another way, regions are in general either "faraway civilizations", "wilderness + mystery", "wilderness + mystery with 1 or 2 well known civs", "mostly populated"

5:07 PM

If I think about the "civilizations and cultures" for each region, I think we have: Far North: mystery/wilderness Northwest Coast: fuzzy North Sentinels: Deno'qai, stoneborn, dwarves but with a "wilderness" vibe Greater Sembara: extensive/well defined North Green Sea: Ursk + dwarves and stoneborn in the Svijnaro mountains + Vagardi + wilderness/mystery vibe Greater Chardon: I think well defined? I asume you have a decently clear idea of non-chardon cultures, if any Central Highlands: dwarves/elves/deno'qai/stoneborn some intentionally blank patches (Myrani Gap) Upper Istaros: Aurbez/Orenlas + mystery/wilderness Western Green Sea: very unclear Eastern Green Sea: intentionally blank Apporia + Nevos: Illoria + mystery/intentionally blank Dunmar: well defined Drankor: mystery/wilderness Far South: intentionally blank

5:03 PM

I actually think it is mostly a problem with the Northwest Coast and the Western Green Sea



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 5:02 PM EST

(although i kind of like a signal of "empty because no one has invented stuff here" vs "empty because it is wiilderness" in the player-facing sections, not just dm notes)

5:01 PM

alternatively i think it is fine to write it as if the region were complete, and just add details as more stuff gets invented later on

5:00 PM

i don't think it is necessary to completely preserve an in-world / character-facing writing style for the region pages



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 4:55 PM EST

I guess it is kinda hard to write the gazetter landing page for this region in particular, because it isn't just a "mostly unknown" place like the far north or far south but it is also not very complete from a development standpoint



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 4:47 PM EST

major? nothing particularly canonically determined, but there probably are some somewhere



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 4:26 PM EST

Question 1: Non-humans. Any major non-human settlements other than salt lizardfolk on mawar?

4:26 PM

(Northwest coast = basiclly Mawar + Voltara region).

4:25 PM

I'm working on Northwest Coast landing page... A few questions. Any you don't get to I'll add to doc with check/tim later tonight



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 4:01 PM EST

pushed



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:45 PM EST

and I'm keeping the duplicated landing pages - one at Species\Species which is "character facing" and one at Species\Mechanics\Species of Taelgar which is "player facing"

3:44 PM

I put "creating new species" in species\mechanics as it seemed to fit there



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 3:44 PM EST

that is a slightly more complicated decision than the species org itself - i think we just decided they don't belong in species, so from the species point of view no open questions. but from a larger point of view those need a consistent home

3:43 PM

maybe add an Open Questions at the bottom for things like that



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:42 PM EST

there is still an open question, i.e. *Open Questions*: Where do larger pages about culture of species go, i.e. [[People of the Rainbow]], [[Dwarven Kingdoms]], or [[Story About Halfling Merchants]]



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 3:41 PM EST

i was moving things into finished if there is no further page reorganization to do, not if all the pages were finished.



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:39 PM EST

species isn't really finished, but it has well defined content



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 3:20 PM EST

also update vault page as needed if you can



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:20 PM EST

ok, I'm going to move around species but not introduce a civ + culture just ye

3:20 PM

true



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 3:20 PM EST

it is also easy to publish a specific background page, just need to update the ignore file to keep that page, and then manually add it to toc



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:19 PM EST

but it is easy to leave languages in species for now as well

3:19 PM

thats fair, although the languages pages are valuable to publish



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 3:18 PM EST

but i think it is find to dump things in background for now, and the pull stuff out of background later

3:18 PM

yeah, okay, i can get behind that. i am still a little lukewarm on civilizations and culture, and I'd kind of prefer to hold off big gazetteer reorgs until we finish the region reorg.



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:17 PM EST

and the mechanics/species and mechanics/species of taelar moves to specieis/mechanics

3:17 PM

then languages moves to Civilization and Culture/Langauges

3:17 PM

or maybe a "goblinoids" instead of hobgoblins, or a folder for "Evil" that includes goblins,etc + orcs

3:16 PM

that means the species organization could be something like: Species/Mechanics/... Species/Extraplanar/... Species/Unusual/... Species/[Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Orcs, Hobgoblins, Halflings, Stoneborn, Lizardfolk]

3:13 PM

So I might say something like: The species folder should focus on global truths about a species - lifecycle, biology, special abilities, as well as 'big picture' history/culture/religion. Details about a specific culture ("sentinenls dwarven kingdoms", "people of the rainbow") or just longer articles about species goes in civ/

3:11 PM

yes



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 3:11 PM EST

elven cycle of generations could be in background, to be honest



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:11 PM EST

and if you start wanting to have several different pages, link them to Civilizations and Cutlure/Elves/blah blah



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 3:11 PM EST

right



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:10 PM EST

so then the rule could be we have a page but not a folder for each playable species in species



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 3:10 PM EST

but maybe that's fine

3:10 PM

it makes it a little arbitrary why history and religion are separate (history less arbitrary than religion)

3:10 PM

right



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:09 PM EST

it makes it easy to link out from other areas to a See more: Dwarven Culture

3:08 PM

This is where I am starting to think a Civilizations and Cultures folder would help a lot

3:08 PM

Sure



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 3:08 PM EST

i don't think it has to be perfect, and can be revised depending on how gazetteer ends up

3:07 PM

i think 1-4 fit most obviously in species, with 5 fitting either in gazetteer or tbd

3:05 PM

hmmm



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 3:04 PM EST

also there are questions like "human cultures of taelgar" - is that in species?

3:01 PM

I'm also not sure how pages about dwarven religion intersect with this

3:01 PM

i.e. dwarven coins + dwarven kingdoms are kinda off in their own spots

2:59 PM

Less sure about species. In general, the broad "species" topic contains: 1 Player-facing pages about playable species and mechanics 2 Meta pages about typologies and "how to make up new species" 3 in-world or character pages about odd/unusual/scary species ("enemies" broadly) 4 in-world or character pages about playable specieis 5 in-world or character pages about specific cultures or realms of playable species (?) Right now I think the lines between 4 and 5 are fairly unclear



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 2:35 PM EST

And Campaigns, modulo the open questions

2:35 PM

Strong agreement on catagorization of page types and Background + Cosmology + Gods and Religions



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 2:19 PM EST

mostly working the rest of the afternoon so will be sporadic to reply

2:19 PM

pushed an in-progress Vault Organization page. lmk if you see anything that you don't agree with there



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 1:11 PM EST

okay pushed

1:11 PM

i'm pushing the reorg above now even though some things aren't perfect to prevent messy conflicts if you do anything this afternoon

1:10 PM

am also going to type up a vault organization note.

1:10 PM

i am going to implement that, but leave any other major changes for now

1:09 PM

anyway, for now, I think the big change that is obvious is we need a "Gods and Religion" top-level directory for gods, religions, and festivals, which then leads to cosmology having just multiverse stuff (for now) and time disappearing (with calendar eras -> background)

1:09 PM

right



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 1:09 PM EST

I’m not even sure there has to be a single answer

1:07 PM

For example, if I started a project to better define the Zimkovan realms I’m not sure that the best way to tackle culture and religion and politics and government would be on the separate Ardlas/Breva/etc pages



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 1:04 PM EST

ah. hmm. maybe



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 1:03 PM EST

Ie keep the Gazetter page short “dramitis persona” style no matter what and link to a longer page

1:03 PM

I was wondering if See more: [[Realm of Sembara]] is the best solution



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 1:02 PM EST

but maybe that can be done manually

1:02 PM

it is very annoying for taelgarverse though as I definitely want Dunmar to be the landing page for the Dunmar nav structure

1:02 PM

hrm. maybe.



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 1:01 PM EST

I’m not totally sure. If I’m working on trying to make a Dunmar style page on sembara I actually care more about religion and history than the details of a timber village in the barony of Aveil



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 12:54 PM EST

I'd keep realm big pages in Gazetteer. if i'm working on a Chardonian Empire cleanup I want everything in one place



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 12:52 PM EST

The open question would be should realm “big pages” move out of Gazetter

12:50 PM

I think we can agree that religion and gods should move to Religion folder as well as holidays

12:50 PM

My motivation is Gazetter because I’m trying to go through each folder for each region as I do the landing pages

12:49 PM

Yeah that’s not a bad idea



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 12:40 PM EST

but it would be nice to have documentation of folders that are "clean" and those that are not

12:40 PM

in particular, I'm motivated to reorganize Cosmology, having just worked on it extensively, but not sure I want to decide about how History and Events are split up all in one big sweep

12:40 PM

i might make a new "Vault Organization" page to track things

12:39 PM

it might actually be fine to just tackle directory reorganization piecemeal instead of all at once



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 12:38 PM EST

but I like having a "Cleenseau Region" folder because I publish it as a top level sidebar nav from [https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/campaigns/cleenseau-campaign/cleenseau-campaign/](https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/campaigns/cleenseau-campaign/cleenseau-campaign/ "https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/campaigns/cleenseau-campaign/cleenseau-campaign/")



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 12:38 PM EST

yeah i actually didn't know about the find or create note feature, that is very helpful



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 12:37 PM EST

i.e. to get to Essford Manor is 6 levels deep. It is much easier to just type ess into the search and pick

![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/1180_1_1_image.png.59yqH49OnU.png)

image.png

74.85KB

12:36 PM

Partly for (1) I find the diretory structure way too deep to be comfortable for cleenseau

12:36 PM

and (3)

12:36 PM

I find the directory structure very useful for (2) though

12:35 PM

I am about to go get lunch then have a meeting but one quick thought -- for finding things I always just us the "find or create a note" feature, I never use the directory structure



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 12:34 PM EST

just to step back, i think the main goals of the directory structure in obsidian should be: (1) make it easy to do worldbuliding and session prep - it should be easy to find things without having to search. (2) facilitate "worldbuilding projects" by linking things you want to update together in on place (3) serve as a way to auto-generate navigation sidebars for subsets of the vaul that are largest published as-is



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 12:31 PM EST

Another grey area: does specieis or civilization and culture cover elvish civilization?

12:30 PM

Also the above doesn't touch on things at all

12:30 PM

And some questions: Is it a good idea to split based on "Type of page" rather than "thing the page describes" Does it make sense to have the Sembara page or Dunmar page outside of Gazetteer?

12:29 PM

There are some grey areas: When does a basic page about a realm get "big enough" to move to Civilizations and Cultures from Gazetteer? When does a basic page about a archfey or fey domain get "in-world" enough to move to Cosmology from People or Gazetteer (and where does a long page describing the culture of Twilight's Grace go? Civilization and Cultures or Cosmology) * What is the line between "history" and "events"

12:27 PM

* Background: Wikipedia style pages written from a "author/meta" perspective

12:26 PM

If I was looking for a radical reorganization I think I'd look at these types of things to help categorize. Would it make sense to do something like Cosmology: "in-world" pages about the multiverse, including any long speculative pages about certain people or places (but the key thing is these are all in the "in-world" style) Religion: "Wikipedia" and "dramatis persona" style pages, organized by specific religion, not type of god, about religious cultures and traditions, holidays, and gods (would potentially benefit from eventually having some more "in-world" pages written) Civilizations and Cultures: "Wikipedia" style articles about civilizations and cultures; no dramatis persona stuff here Gazeteer: "dramatis persona" style pages about places People: "dramatis persona" style pages about people and groups of people Species: "Wikipedia" and "in-world" style pages about species History: "wikipedia" and "in-world" style pages about the past Events: "dramastic persona" style pages about specific events



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 12:20 PM EST

It might be better to say that we have 3 styles of "wikipedia" page: Pages written from the perspective of a "in-game" encyclopedia article: omniscient, in that it states the true facts about the world, not the theories or controversies, but character-facing, i.e. it is written in a way that would read basically sensibly to a character Pages written from the perspective of an "out-game" encyclopedia article: omniscient and character-facing but includes player-facing language (i.e. real world analogs or roleplaying advice or whatever) * Pages written from the perspective of a "author's note/meta" perspective

12:16 PM

I guess there is a fourth type which is "mechanics" pages, which are explicilty written to address player rather than character concerns. But these are fairly small I think

12:15 PM

To expand a bit... I think we have basically three types of pages: "dramatis persona" style pages, which tend to be relatively short, frontmatter heavy, and similar in spirit to the type of thing you would write in a glossary or dramatis persona in a novel. "Wikipedia" style pages, which tend to be relatively long and cover in-world information from a position of omniscience. * "In-world" style pages, which is mostly just the stuff you have been doing for Multiverse, which is explicitly written from a position of uncertainity, and is written from the perspective of a research or highly educated person in world



**Deciusmus**

01/28/2025 at 12:00 PM EST

Argueably groups should be in People

11:59 AM

Cosmology: I would make it just the multiverse. Make a separate top level folder for Relgion and move gods under each religion's section

11:57 AM

and just have some pages in a different style

11:57 AM

Alternatively, maybe it is better to just kinda have a loose organization under "People" for every page that reflects a specific meetable entity

11:56 AM

I think in general it is worth moving the "important" people to History the "staging" people to staging, and then having a People\Sembaran Royalty or whatever rather than a People\Historical Figures\Sembaran Royalty

11:55 AM

A few thoughts.... **People**: I think the People folder should be reserved for dramatis persona style descriptions of individuals. The published information should read relatively in-world, i.e. what a PC would write if they were taking notes on everyone they encountered. Roleplaying notes or mechanics/leveled class type information should be ain a Campaign:None tag. - Powerful creatures who might have myths and legends about them should probably go in (TBD) but not people Historical people are a bit of a problem, as there are a few categories of historical people: - "important" people for whom it might be worth writing a few "in-world" style paragraphs (such and such scholar thinks they did blah, contradicted by... etc - examples might include Avatus, Asuddha, Cece I, Eudomes, Amloch) - "little" people who just happen to be dead or long dead. The only difference between these and regular people is that they died potentially a long time ago - but likely some part of them was encountered in game (i.e. Marius of Drankor or Celine Essford) - "rulers" people who have pages just to help track dynasties and regnal lists and what not (most people in Sembaran Royalty) - "staging" people who were invented just to have a name on a document or report (i.e. Adele Laurent or Ila or )



**rsulfuratus**

01/28/2025 at 11:04 AM EST

feel free to dump random thoughts or just ignore this entirely for now

11:04 AM

anyway - that is a huge wall of text and now i'm going to vanish for meetings for the next few hours. only goal during working hours today is finishing cosmology updates if I have time so won't push any more substantial updates. if i have a lot more time than I expect, I might write up a proposed "Purpose of Directories" document to try to solidify some of this brainstorming without committing to anything

11:03 AM

^2: Historical Figures, Extraplanar Powers, and PCs have always been slightly weird categories in People. I'm not sure I'd want to change them, just want to think a bit about whether this is fully correct. E.g., do Historical Figures belong in History? Do Extraplanar Powers belong in Cosmology (with gods, if gods remain in cosmology)? PCs probably stay but might belong in Campaigns?

11:01 AM

footnotes: ^1: Things of course has some bleed-over into campaigns and perhaps should generally not be published? the distinction between "world magic items pages" and "campaign magic item pages" has always been a bit arbitrary but maybe that is fine

10:59 AM

complicated changes: Primary Sources - I'm not sure this directory is worthwhile? the more we incorporate in-world descriptions into text the less sensible it feels to have primary sources segregated into a single directory. most of what is here is either songs (actually hard to place, but could be in background), stories that have been told in game (dunmari myths mostly, could be in history or dunmar or religion), stories for vibes (could go in species or whatever they are vibing about), books or letters with in-world text (could go in thiings)

10:56 AM

complicated changes: Groups is basically "anything a person can be a part of, except religion". possibly this is fine and we shoud move religions here. it might be worth introducing a bit more of a top-level groups hierarchy for navigational purposes. e.g., could have: Religions, Cultures, Organizations, Families as top-level or something. Orc Hordes and Hobgobling Clans are possibly more equivalent to realms than anything else? Hard to say.

10:54 AM

complicated changes: History and Events are a huge muddle with no clear indication of what goes where. History has some overview pages, a few scattered undated events, and "historical places" (although "historical people" are in People). events has events organized by time, but some of the (e.g. the Riving) are unclear why they are here not History (or Cosmology). i'm not sure what to do here, exactly

10:52 AM

possible changes: Species - ideally I think this would have three kinds of content: overview pages of "species typologies", e.g. "elementals", "undead", "~Elder Folk~", written in-world style; player-facing overviews of playable races and common non-playable races in the style of the current elf/dwarf/etc page, written in a blend of above-table and in-world styles but focused on culture, lore, etc; player-facing non-mechanical / campaign-independent details about playing a species that focuses on "what you should think about re: this species" type things (e.g., names could go here, and some of the stuff in "Campaigns/mechanics"

10:49 AM

possible changes: Time - currently has the Calendar Eras page and then some religious stuff. maybe should just move calendar eras to Background and combined festivals with religion.

10:48 AM

possible changes: Cosmology - currently includes gods, planes, and religion; does not include religious festivals or holidays, and does not include gazetteer-style descriptions of locations on other planes (including fey realms or specific domains of shadow) Proposed new content - canonical in-world details about the other planes, and named powers of these planes (basically, the 'extraplanar powers' category moves here). religion moves elsewhere. Proposed new content 2 - just the multiverse. gods and religion move elsewhere, nothing new is added. entirely written in-world.

10:45 AM

(footnotes in a bit)

10:45 AM

unchanged: Background - canonical pages of worldbuilding background information; i think always written above-table, and never published Campaigns - campaign-specific player-facing information Worldbuilding - per recent reorg Things - canonical pages of things or classes of things that exist in world; generally written above-table, generally published with some exclusions (^1) People - canonical pages about people; generally written above-table, generally published with some exclusions, primary purose is a dramatis personae for games (^2) Gazetteer - canonical pages of places; written in a mix of styles but usually above-table or simple factual statements, generally published with some exclusions

i am almost done with my multiverse rewrite - my goal is to get all this integrated into the next taelgarverse update this weekend. so i might work next on a bit of TOC and general reorg. the general goal is to clean up the taelgarverse TOC which I think is a bit too inclusive, and use more things like having a list of the mos numena gods on the pantheon page instead of having each god in the sidebar nav. as a side effect, i'm thinking about a few reorgs of the main obsidian vault. my main goals are: (1) I like the in-world style a lot but it is a lot of work (if enjoyable) and not always appropriate. i am wondering - but not settled - on whether it makes more sense to have in-world vs above-table directories to make it clearer what is what. (2) i increasingly think there are only a few directories where we want to copy the nav structure from the obsidian vault directly to markdown, which opens up more possibilities for an obsidian reorg (3) often find it faster to search for a file than pull it up in the nav, but obsidian's search is kind of terrible since it doesn't prioritize file names. this makes me want to reorg the directory structure to be faster to find things. (4) a lot of the directory structure was created early on and the kinds of pages we want/have have changed so it is worth a look to see if everything still makes sense a rough idea for a proposal follows

9:07 PM

chains (starting from either primary or secondary or home or current or whatever) always follow "current" location

9:07 PM

the "inLocation" helper function finds things in both primary or secondary locations

9:06 PM

Basic idea: two new types on a whereabouts: primary and secondary primary is just an alias for "home" secondary is special - it is NEVER the current location, so basically it can only ever be the "secondary" location new displayDefaults: wSecondary defaults to "Located

Aldemar stumbles into a fey-run “lottery” (hosted by elves in masquerade masks) where every ticket is free… but each one subtly steals an hour of his lifespan. The prizes are illusions: deeds to phantom estates, titles to forgotten kingdoms. He “wins” endlessly, celebrating his “good fortune” as he rapidly ages. The fey siphon his stolen time into hourglasses, selling it to Drankor’s secret societies.

9:01 PM

how about this Aldemar encounters a fey “banker” (posing as a human financier) offering to exchange his “outdated” Drankor coins for Feywild currency that “doubles in value hourly.” He eagerly trades his purse, but unbeknownst to him, every Fey coin he accepts erases a memory of his past wealth. By scene’s end, he’s frantically counting shimmering coins, oblivious that he’s forgotten his own name, his ledger, and the Society of Unveiled Accounts’ warnings.

A little to "secret society" oriented, but 3. The Vineyard of Vanity Aldemar meets a vintner (“elf” fey with ivy-crowned hair) selling wine that “reveals hidden desires.” Each sip erodes his memory of Drankor’s Society of Unveiled Accounts, replacing it with visions of himself as a king. He trades his ledger (his tether to reality) for a cask, unaware the wine turns to vinegar by dawn. The fey use the ledger to infiltrate Drankor’s secret economies.

write a scene from a play. Here is what I know about the play: It is called "A Fools' Fortune" It is about a merchant who gets lost in the Feywild and slowly loses all his money to a variety of fey tricksters, thinking he is getting richer and richer all the time. The Feywild is a fairy realm where various classic fey types live the play was written by a playwright in a city called Drankor * Drankor is full of secret societies and magic

this is better I think: In a pivotal scene from [[A Fool’s Fortune]], Estelis encounters a pixie offering to trade a “Field of Gold.” The pixie describes it with grandiose imagery: an endless plain of golden light, shimmering as far as the eye can see, where riches grow like grass and all who possess it are envied by kings. Entranced, Estelis cannot resist, and he offers a pouch of his finest gems to secure the deal. The pixie produces a delicate box, no larger than a hand, and insists the field lies within. “The gold is yours, fine merchant—just sow the seeds of your ambition, and it will flourish.” The audience, of course, recognizes the trap: inside the box lies nothing but a handful of dandelion seeds, whose blooms, in their fleeting moment, might appear golden in the sun

this wasn't too bad as a sonnet: Beneath the boughs where twilight shadows play, The fey spin bright, their songs a siren’s call. Through glens of gold and meadows wrapped in gray, Their laughter weaves a spell to bind us all. The shifting woods bewitch all guiding light, As time dissolves within this haunted glade. No dawn will break to end eternal night, Where bargains made demand the price be paid. Fair beauty shrouds the thorn and hides the snare, With shimmering hues that veil a darker scheme. Beware, O heart, for wonder masks despair, And joy dissolves like mist within a dream. 'Neath shadowed skies, the endless whispers weave, The mournful songs of those who cannot leave.

here is the best version so far. I think it can do better with a bit of prompting: And a famous scene in [[A Fool's Fortune]] depicts the tragi-comic hero, Estelis, gleefully bargaining with a pixie who offers him a "crown of starlight," said to bestow the wearer with eternal respect and adoration. Estelis, overcome with visions of glory, eagerly hands over his entire purse of gold. The pixie solemnly places an ornate crown made of cobwebs and dew on his head, whispering that it is invisible to those unworthy of its power. Estelis, beaming with pride, parades around the stage, boasting of his newfound majesty, while the audience, well-versed in fey trickery, can barely contain their laughter.

(primary is a synonym for home)

8:13 PM

but then add the idea of type = secondary, which is another whereabouts piece (separate from home or current)

8:13 PM

I think what you actually want is to revert all the changes I did (i.e. make it so that we always follow current in whereabout chains, no matter what)

8:11 PM

but actually the key thing is that the "secondary" location cannot be home or current

I think primary/secondary would really work the best

8:04 PM

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 8:03 PM EST

i'm not sure it is ever useful to follow non-polity on a person page, unless you can't because the place isn't in a polity

8:03 PM

e.g., you don't want: Songara plains -> Dunmari basin -> Greater Dunmar you want Songara plains -> Dunmari basin -> Dunmar or Songara plains -> Central Dunmar -> Dunmar

8:02 PM

and geographic feaure -> larger feature -> region, except when the geographic feature is wholly contained in a realm, and then you might go larger feature -> realm

8:01 PM

mostly, you want buildings -> settlements -> subunits of realms -> realms



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:57 PM EST

right I think that is probably true



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:57 PM EST

you can always click on Voltara for more

7:57 PM

so more useful to list Voltara, Chardonian Empire than Voltara, Northwest Coast

7:56 PM

I think that polity is usually the primary thing you care about



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:55 PM EST

A clarifying set of questions might be: For Lyra, what is the right thing to show for her location? Voltara/Northwest Coast or Voltara/Chardonian Empire? Is the answer the same for a inn in Voltara? And some assumptions: On the Voltara page, we presumably want to see both "on the Northwest Coast" and "in the Chardonian Empire". We want to be able to do a "cities in Chardonian Empire" which should return Voltara We want to be able to do a "places in Northwest Coast" which should return Voltara

7:53 PM

I guess it also goes back to your point earlier about "what do we want to do"

7:52 PM

I actually wonder if the whole thing would be easier if we didn't use whereabouts for polity at all



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:49 PM EST

but that is too fiddly to code

7:48 PM

i mean the right way to do this is actually with a graph structure

7:47 PM

but maybe not too bad

7:47 PM

it makes the dataview queries a bit trickier because you have to check both primary and secondary



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:46 PM EST

or really anything

7:46 PM

the nice thing about type = primary and type = secondary is that it would work for watersheds as well



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:45 PM EST

although i do think the idea of region and polity might not be perfect

7:45 PM

e.g. follows current, follows home

7:44 PM

i think the token is the simplest. based on a quick glance at your tokenparser updates i think you could just have a code like X mean follow the opoosite



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:44 PM EST

alternatively, the whole idea of "polity" vs "region" is a bad idea. instead, it should just be type = primary and type = secondary

7:43 PM

alternatively, it is back to some idea on the frontmatter, i.e. primaryWhereabouts: polity

7:41 PM

letters just examples

7:40 PM

means current location, following home

7:40 PM

means current location, following current all the way

7:40 PM

I hate to add more letters after the : in current, but one option would be to just have an option for what to follow



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:39 PM EST

i mean this is back to primary/secondary



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:39 PM EST

I just mean, that is the right place to fix it

7:39 PM

I think that's up to the Voltara page



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:39 PM EST

well, for lyra, should it say "Based in Voltara, on the Northwest Coast" or "Based in Voltara, the Chardonian Empire"?



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:38 PM EST

well I think for any given place you probably know what the right chain should be from that place up, right?



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:36 PM EST

this is a fundamental problem with allowing places to have multiple chains though, unless you figure out a way to combine the chains into a single line

**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:33 PM EST

which is not great

7:33 PM

because we are piggybacking on home/current I think the current location line on a person will use the polity and the home line will use the region

7:32 PM

the problem I just realized is that this is going to break people in places

7:32 PM

I'm not totally surehow this is simpler than just having the idea of a "region" and "polity" in the whereabouts (i.e. so whereabouts returns 6 strings rather than 4) and then just not having current/home for places at all (



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:32 PM EST

you could call them fullRegion, fullPolity, simpleRegion, simplePolity or something

7:31 PM

depending on checking type and whether locations are the same

7:31 PM

that was where the primary/secondary comes from. basically you need four pre-specified display strings and then pass the right one to tokenparser

7:30 PM

i didn't think that out in detail, but since we can set place-specific displayDefaults and then pass then to TokenParser in the output handler that seems feasible



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:30 PM EST

I'm not sure how this piggybacks on display defaults and such



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:29 PM EST

actually the default option being (full typeof string) (polity) is probably better because then you can override it with {type: region, location }

7:28 PM

if current location exists but home location is unknown, you have just polity

7:28 PM

say region primary, polity seconardy

7:28 PM

so then you have a primary/secondary

7:27 PM

if current location = home.location but current.type != home.type, I think this can only happen when you set both region and polity

7:27 PM

in this case, you have a default option, say (full typeof string) (region)

7:26 PM

(i think)

7:26 PM

for the simple case, e.g. whereabouts: Castrella current.location = home.location current.type = home.type = "home"

7:26 PM

you only care about current and home anyway

7:25 PM

yeah basically. i haven't taken the time to work out the full logic but i think just knowing type and location for each whereabout would let you pick out the right way to display every permutation



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:23 PM EST

and so if you don't have a home, you could do something different

7:23 PM

if the current has type polity it means it is a "different" current from home

7:23 PM

I guess you could tell whether the current is the same as home or not

7:22 PM

so you could do something where if (whereabout.current.type = polity) but again, not sure how that helps you.

7:20 PM

i missing that

7:20 PM

i see

7:20 PM

ah but it has the full whereabouts

7:19 PM

yeah but it doesn't have the chains



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:19 PM EST

it has the full metadata



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:19 PM EST

in our "inn in Castrella" case, these will all be "castrella"

7:19 PM

i.e. the output handler only has access to: current home origin lastKnown

7:18 PM

right but I dont think you can define the conditions correctly without changing the lower layers



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 7:17 PM EST

maybe "primary/secondary" is wrong but if you can write down under which conditions you;d want each combination it should be possible to code in output handler

7:17 PM

fundamentally though you basically want some combination of (full description, located in) (region chain, polity chain)



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 7:16 PM EST

I'm not sure if primary/secondary is the right way to think about it...



**Deciusmus**

why does the order matter?



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 6:39 PM EST

actually you might be able to just change this to compare strings not locations: if (!whereabout.current.location || whereabout.current.location != whereabout.home.location) {

6:36 PM

might be wrong

6:35 PM

but i think all in output handler

6:35 PM

i mean a little more complicated

6:35 PM

but i think in that case it is just a matter of picking something, and then if you set the other, you get both, right?

6:35 PM

then you need some logic about which is primary and which is secondary if there are both, and which is primary if there is one

6:34 PM

right but this is what I mean about primary vs secondary. you need four displaystrings for locations: - primaryRegion: " <(of )primary> " - primaryPolity: " <(of )primary> ", - secondaryRegion: "Located " - secondaryPolity: ""Located "



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 6:34 PM EST

anyway, time for dinner but I'll be around later

6:34 PM

but what we want is to display the home string (i.e. the full " <(of )primary> ") but using insteadof

6:33 PM

so if we are displaying the "home" string, we use the token and if we are displaying the "current" string we use the token

6:33 PM

right now it works because we have: "wHome" : " <(of )primary> ", "wCurrent" : "Located ",

6:32 PM

so the problem is what should we display? we don't know if we should display or

6:32 PM

these are reprsented by the and tokens in the output handler/token parser code



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 6:32 PM EST

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 6:32 PM EST

that isn't how chains work. You have two chains: the "home" aka region chain which is " Castrella; Apporia the "current" aka polity chain which is "Castrella; Chardonian Empire"

6:31 PM

Well, no

6:31 PM

yes



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 6:31 PM EST

i must be missing something. if you set type = polity, you ge the right chain, right? the only problem is you have the wrong display string



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 6:29 PM EST

because if you wanted Castrella, Apporia, rather than Castrella, Chardonian Empire, you could set type: region

6:29 PM

It would be straightforward (ish) to make "polity with no home" the same as home (as you suggested above) but it doesn't really solve anything

6:28 PM

i.e. you get this

18.58KB

6:28 PM

not Castrella, Cedrano

6:28 PM

so you get Castrella, Apporia

6:28 PM

yes but it thinks you should follow the "home" chain

6:28 PM

the "home unknown" display string is "", so you just get "current" which is "Located in "



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 6:28 PM EST

right but can't the output handler see this is a place and set home to Castrella too?



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 6:27 PM EST

so it uses "the home unknown" and the "current" display strings

6:27 PM

the problem is that this: whereabouts: - {type: polity, location: Castrella} because it is shorthand for whereabouts: - {type: away, location: Castrella} generates Home location: unknown Current location: Castrella



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 6:27 PM EST

that is you don't want "wHome" and "wCurrent" for places, you want "wPrimary" and "wSecondary"

but then you get "located in" rathre than "A tavern in"

you can also fix it by doing type: plity

Main annoying things: anything where you have a single whereabouts you get the the "region" chain rather than the "polity" change

ok

OK. So poking a bit. This region vs polity thing helps a lot, in that it makes it easy to segragate the "political/realms" context from the "geography/features" context



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 5:10 PM EST

seems to work pretty well

5:10 PM

ok, I should't have spent quite so long on this but I pushed a change



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 4:36 PM EST

which I think is fine

4:35 PM

which makes sense, but it means you can't say "used to be part of ..."

4:35 PM

i.e. we in general never display "aways" that are no longer current

4:35 PM

but there is no concept of "past away"

4:35 PM

i.e. if you change the current date to 1544 it changes to "An Isinguer city in the Upper Isaros" and adds the polity line

4:35 PM

this works:

Isingue is a bit weird



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 4:28 PM EST

so altogether Burganos can't on the info block show both Chardonian Empire and Nevos Sea, it is in both

4:28 PM

and there is an "inPolity" that correctly returns everything in the polity

4:27 PM

correctly returns everything Nevos Sea

4:27 PM

that is: dataviewjs const { util } = customJS dv.table(["Place", "Type Of"], dv.pages("#place") .where(f => util.inRegion("Nevos Sea", f.file.frontmatter, dv.current().pageTargetDate)) .sort(b => util.s("<maintype>", b.file)) .map(b => <a style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(0, 168, 252);cursor:pointer !important" href="" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="">util.s("<name> (<pronunciation>)", b.file), util.s("<maintype>", b.file)</a>)

4:27 PM

ok, I fixed it so dataview queries at least work



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 4:21 PM EST

that's a bit more annoying to implement



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 4:20 PM EST

or polity could be a synonym for away unless !home in which case home, to catch the edge case where you want to specify polity because of a change in ownership but don't have a region

4:19 PM

I think you should never have away without home, right? because if there is just one whereabout you'd always use home

4:18 PM

I think it is worth pushing. i might change the wCurrent default for place to something else, maybe "Located in"



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 4:16 PM EST

yeah that is the same as the dunmar case, as long as the geography page and the polity page are different it should be fine

01/27/2025 at 4:14 PM EST

(although in practice dunmar is the special case because mostly we don't have geography pages)

4:14 PM

e.g. for Karawa, you have polity: Eastern Dunmar and region: Karawa Desert



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 4:13 PM EST

nothing in the code is smart enough to realize the chain might be different



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 4:13 PM EST

but Illoria is actually the special case there

4:13 PM

ah right



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 4:13 PM EST

no because they are both Iloria so we drop



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 4:13 PM EST

whereabouts: {type: region, location: Illoria } {type: polity, location: Illoria } doesn't work?



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 4:12 PM EST

i.e. there is no way to show on the burganos page both polity chain and region chain, you have to pick which one

4:12 PM

not sure it is worth pushing

4:12 PM

gah, nevermind, it doesn't really work that well in any non-trivial case

4:11 PM

then on Burganos, I can set: whereabouts: - {type: region, location: Illoria } and just get

4:10 PM

you likely need to set the display defaults (wCurrent) on the page to get decent output

4:10 PM

(after 1740)

4:10 PM

I get:

![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/1430_1_1_image.png.E104oC_5Gv.png)

image.png

10.93KB

4:09 PM

so if I take Illoria and set the whereabouts to: whereabouts: - {type: region, location: Nevos Sea } - {type: polity, location: Chardonian Empire, start: 1740 }

4:07 PM

OK. I gotta finish some emails, but here is what I have working as a quick fix. (a) whereabouts accepts 2 new types: region (synonym for home) and polity (synonym for away with an end date of 9999 unless it is specified) (b) there is a new format string, "region", which is is like current or home or origin, but which follows region rather than current



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 3:53 PM EST

i'm not sure there is a simple way to tackle (c) that would really be satisfying

3:53 PM

i actually think that your proposed (b) is likely the best solution

3:52 PM

well maybe that last sentence is not quite right

3:52 PM

these two are in conflict, because guaranteeing 1 makes 2 impossible

3:51 PM

so I think there are two kinds of problems here: (1) from a query point of view: being able to identify all the places that are located in a bigger place is very useful. since we do not have the world uniquely divided up into non-overlapping "bigger places", this creates gaps that are kind of annoying. e.g., a list of "all the realms in region XX" is going to be incomplete if any realms cross regions, which is annoying. (2) from a data point of view: the larger context is very helpful to report in the frontmatter since sometimes this is all we know about a thing. for many rivers, the only invented information is that it is drawn on the map - in this case, both the watershed and the actual location (and realm, if relevant) are useful. similarly true for bays/gulfs and for (some) small islands.



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 3:48 PM EST

i.e. if the goal is to just have a dataview query on each watershed page that gets all the rivers in the watershed, you could just add watershed: x and it would work. If the goal was to have watersheds appear in the info block in a nice way then that requires some coding

3:47 PM

and I guess within C there is also a bit of a question about what exactly the problem is

3:46 PM

then with c, there is the "try to do it in a way that makes it possible to roll into a general solution later" vs just say "watershed: x" is a new valid frontmatter tag

3:45 PM

Right, I guess I could see a few ways forward: (a) ignore it entirely. Pages have a "primary" whereabouts and that means sometimes they won't appear in other queries that would make sense for them to appear in (b) ignore it for now. don't try to solve subparts of the problem, and just live with some query-gaps until we have the desire/energy to try to tackel the general problem. (c) pick one or two key subparts that bug us/have high value and solve them individually. Potential subparts could be: watersheds regions mountain ranges oceans/seas



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 3:43 PM EST

the challenge is more what would we want the code to do?

3:43 PM

although if we could write a good spec doc, chatGPT-o1 could almost certainly write the code

3:43 PM

hence wondering about solving subsets of the problem that come up most frequently



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 3:43 PM EST

Yes, I agree



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 3:42 PM EST

however, I think that solving that general problem in a satisfying way might be extremely complex

3:42 PM

right, yes. the basic issue is that there is not a strict 1:1 relationship between levels of geography



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 3:41 PM EST

But this goes back to how much effort to solve it.

3:41 PM

But you might want it to be.

3:40 PM

Imagine a "Mos Numema temple complex" in Embry, which straddles the "Old City" and "New City". And then you have a Temple of the Wildling. It can't be in both "mos numena template complex, Embry..." and "Old City, Embry"

3:39 PM

I don't think it is a context or typeOf issue at all, in other words, it is just a problem that occurs when the nested of locations in other locations hits a location that crosses a boundary

3:38 PM

I actually think the 3rd bullet is entirely a boundary drawing issue... The "Chasa-Nadhi" watershed crosses regions, so anything where the "primary" location chain is in a region won't also be in the watershed page The "Mostreve Hills" crosses realms, so anything where the primary location chain goes up to Mostreve Hills skips the realm * The Sentinels crosses regions, so anything where the "primary" location chain chains up to sentinels won't be in any region



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 3:29 PM EST

So I guess to simplify..... my position is something like: For any given page, there is almost always an obvious whereabouts to put it in For most pages, this obvious whereabout is the only whereabout * For some pages, the obvious whereabout causes the page to chain up to something like "skips" a key "unit" for this page. Most obvious examples are pages that are in Green Sea or Sentinels (which skip region), or rivers (which skip the watershed, if it is between the region and Taelgar); but some pages (i.e. Westcliff) are best stated as "in the Mostreve Hills" but that might be skipping the realm (i.e. Addermarch or Tyrwingha)

3:27 PM

because "origin" is really just shorthand for "home at your birth date"

3:27 PM

but whereabouts doesn't overload (currently) to a third concept

3:27 PM

also I think in general political entities are all in a single region with the exception of Chardon + Tollen, and also mostly political entities chain nicely, i.e. you don't have to change that many pages

3:26 PM

i.e. if Chardon had conqueored Darba, some value in having Darba = part of Dunmar in 1720 but part of Chardon in 1750

3:25 PM

* political units are plauisbly dated

3:25 PM

using away for political unit has two advantages: * the whereabouts code already have the concept of "home" vs "current" location and this is (mostly) already working even when following chains

3:22 PM

but i.e. if you wanted to find all the rivers without a watershed, how would you do it?

3:22 PM

the appeal of using whereabouts was that the code already defaults them to each other whereabouts: X is already shorthand for home: X and origin: X and current: X

3:21 PM

so I don't want to add work, i.e. say that all pages need a "part of" and a "whereabouts" or whatever

3:21 PM

i.e. yes a town could be part of a geographic region and a realm; but for 95% of towns those are the same

3:20 PM

I actually think the challenge is that for most pages, the context is actually the same



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 3:09 PM EST

It might even be easier to extend whereabouts with additional keywords (region, watershed) as necessary than try to use only home/origjn/away for everything

3:07 PM

Maybe that is good enough

3:07 PM

But that comes back to “home = geography, away = polity” and you still need to pick a single geographic chain to follow as you initially suggested

3:06 PM

Eg many rivers have two contexts: a watershed and a realm

3:05 PM

Using away = political unit simplifies a lot of cases if it works

3:05 PM

The question is how much work is it worth to make this work smoothly

3:05 PM

But also eg things that are located in region-spanning things could have three places. A political location, a subunit leading to the region, and the “bigger thing”

3:04 PM

Some things - rivers primarily - might have three contexts: a geographic feature, a political feature, a watershed

3:03 PM

So, maybe a different way to look at it: the basic challenge is that any given location can be located in more than one context. A town can be part of a geographic region and a realm/subrealm, for example



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 3:01 PM EST

I think the generalization challenge with "partOf" is that it only works well if it isn't used as a special case. i.e. it works to say: all typeOf = river should have a partOf = watershed

2:59 PM

but I wouldn't want to change the whereabouts: there - the river is entirely in the Barony of Aveil

2:58 PM

and go back and set "partOf: Enst Watershed"

2:58 PM

i.e. at some level we think it makes sense to go to a page like:

![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/1477_1_1_image.png.ElojiMlsGU.png)

image.png

28.78KB

2:58 PM

watershed works because are amused/think it is worthwhile to specially tag it

2:57 PM

i.e. Urlich Pass is "part of" the Sentinels, but why would you set it as part of not just whereabouts: Sentinels. the "High Peak of the Tyrwinghan Range" is part of the mostreve hills, but again, why would you not just set it as whereabouts?



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 2:57 PM EST

or for "cross typeOf" relationships

2:57 PM

i think the generalization challenge is it doesn't work well for subunits of subunits



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 2:56 PM EST

but outside of watersheds I'm not really sure it works well

2:55 PM

yes, having all rivers have "part of" linking to a watershed page would be fine



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 2:55 PM EST

but for Darakan it doesn't work at all

2:55 PM

so for e.g. rivers it works generally fine

2:55 PM

except in so far as the partOf is the second page you want to link to

2:54 PM

it doesn't solve the issue of two top level links

2:54 PM

I think partOf only really works for subunits - rivers are part of a watershed, mountains are part of a mountain chain, bays/gulfs/etc are part of a sea or ocean



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 2:52 PM EST

So I think you had originally had the idea of using part of, but where do you set it? it makes sens to say that he Kayan is "part of" the Chasa Nadhi Watershed, but does it make sense to say that Darakan is "part of" the Central Highlands region? I don't think so

2:48 PM

But there is no clear why to know which top level page is the "main one" and which is the "secondary" one

2:47 PM

Another way of thinking about it is that we have a set of top level pages (i.e. Gazeteer pages that are "in Taelgar"). For any given page, it might want to be part of 2 of those top level pages.

2:47 PM

Darakan also looks fine. Whereabouts = Khatridun which is then part of sentinels. Page looks fine - the problem is that we don't know which region it is part of

2:46 PM

Kayan has whereabouts = Elderwood, which then tracks back to "Central Highlands" region. Page looks fine - the problem is that we don't know which watershed it is part of (i.e. nothing in the metadata says "tributary of the Chasa"

2:45 PM

So here are two pages:

![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/1494_1_1_image.png.3k388VytDa.png)

image.png

16.49KB

![](../External/.deciusmus_media/.deciusmus/1494_2_1_image.png.qZD674nZRA.png)

image.png

16.95KB



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 2:31 PM EST

but we still want to track the watershed it is part of

2:31 PM

e.g. a river in the Elderwood is probably best tagged as "elderwood" for whereabouts

2:31 PM

have meetings - have a few more thoughts but not time to type them up now. mostly, i'm not sure this does anything for the original "partOf" discussion necessarily



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 2:22 PM EST

Because we don’t have a good way to distinguish between “Irrla an island in the green sea” vs “Irrla a place in the eastern green sea region”

2:21 PM

Well, what I’m saying is that for now, Irrla and similar places won’t be in any region

2:21 PM

Right



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 2:21 PM EST

i'm not sure that this needs any revision particulary to the standard home?



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 2:18 PM EST

Or a dwarven kingdom is “realm in the Sentinels” (which is also too big for a region)

2:18 PM

No concept of “west/north/east”

2:18 PM

So ie Irrla goes Irrla -> Green Sea



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 2:17 PM EST

hmm



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 2:17 PM EST

Exactly



**rsulfuratus**

01/27/2025 at 2:17 PM EST

i might be missing something. is the distinction between "A" and "C" just because "Green Sea" is too big to fit in a specific region?



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 2:17 PM EST

So my proposal for now would be to - allow for “polity” as an alias for away - allow for “geography” as an alias for home - don’t try to map pages to regions where it does not make sense. Everything should either map to a region or one of our “top level” pages

2:15 PM

That said, in the short term I’m not sure that c is actually valuable enough to try to make work

2:14 PM

But I think having a “pages on region” is a useful thing to be able to do

2:14 PM

I actually think most of the time you don’t care about c in the page header block

2:13 PM

You care about these three distinctions because you want to be able: - have a page with “islands in the Green Sea” (and show the text “An island in the Green Sea”) in the header block - this is A - have a page “places in the Republic of Sorvah” (this is B) - have a page “places in the eastern green sea “(c)

2:11 PM

(A) is the main “geographic relationship” (B) is a political relationship (C) is a meta/info organization relationship

2:10 PM

Basically the idea is — imagine a small island off the coast of Irrla. Call it Ril. In general we probably want to say three things about it: (a) this island is in the Green Sea (B) this island is part of the Republic of Sorvah (sp) (C) this island is in the “Eastern Green Sea region”

2:08 PM

But I think the away / current idea would work for political units

2:08 PM

So I spent a few minutes poking at whereabouts. The origin/home stuff doesn’t actually work that well



**Deciusmus**

01/27/2025 at 9:38 AM EST

**rsulfuratus**

01/26/2025 at 8:43 PM EST

pushed an update to cosmology that reorganizes things a little - basically, the in-world scholarly critics of the concept of Echo Realms convinced me that the Feywild and the Dreamworld are central enough to move to the main "Multiverse" directory (once I have a chance to update them), and the rest of the "Echo Realms" are in the Demiplanes folder. curious what you think - context of the note is relevant here



**rsulfuratus**

01/26/2025 at 12:08 PM EST

okay. i'm taking a break from cosmology and doing some gazetteer cleanup, going to move all unnamed pages to staging for cleanup. i have a "backlinks in staging" _MoC doc to help figure out which staging pages are frequently linked to guide prioritization



**Deciusmus**

01/26/2025 at 12:04 PM EST

But no strong preference

12:04 PM

I was using staging for unnamed ~ pages and liked it



**rsulfuratus**

01/26/2025 at 11:40 AM EST

i'm doing some cleanup. what is your opinion about stashing blank pages in staging vs just having stubs in main gazetteer? my preference is to have unnamed places and places without frontmatter in staging, and move stubs that have (a) a name and (b) frontmatter to the correct folder but relatively weak preference



**Deciusmus**

01/26/2025 at 10:45 AM EST

6 is basically the "Kem Watershed"; 4 is the "Semb/Wistel/Volta watersheds"

2:05 PM

where pink = highlands, blue = lowlands, #1 - "Zimkova foothills" - hilly "highland" terrain, mostly forested, many rivers and lakes that are not on the map, plus the big ones that are. Zimka culture #2 - "Vostok High Plateau" - yellostone-esque, blank culturally (but lightly peopled) #3 - Mostreve Hills #4 - main Sembaran lowland #5 = Maseau Plains (distinct and drier than main lowland, bit of Mostreve Hills rain shadow/less moisture from Green Sea) #6 = "Vostok lowlands" (eastern Canada) with the green lines rising up to the hills #7 - undefined Tollen highlands, separates tollen from Vostok, probably a blank slate for right now but no people really #8 = coastal highlands, also likely undefined and probably Skaer

right, since most of the moisture comes from the green sea by the time you get to 4000 feet it is cold and dry

river valleys slope down towards the coast in light blue

1:40 PM

the dark blue are highlands, with the plateau with the lake maybe kind of like lake yellowston

something like the saint lawerence gulf coast of canada

1:36 PM

and the vostok coast is fairly flat until you get to near the mountains

1:36 PM

(ish)

1:36 PM

i think for topography, the area around the word "Vostok" is lowlands

1:35 PM

actually something like this is maybe a good model: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_forest_steppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_forest_steppe "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_forest_steppe")



**Deciusmus**

01/25/2025 at 1:35 PM EST

is it relatively low/flat, or is it hilly?

1:35 PM

right, I mean, the map has it as forest. right now I'm just trying to finish the "topography and major features" section of the greater sembara page



**rsulfuratus**

01/25/2025 at 1:34 PM EST

i think it is not really far enough north for tundra

1:33 PM

i think the region north of the wall is only not forest because it is too dry

1:33 PM

probably in general it should be forest

**Deciusmus**

01/25/2025 at 1:06 PM EST

I pushed a slightly updated structure for the Greater Sembara page, which I think is a good general structure for these main region pages. Let me know what you think, if you get a chance to look at it



**Deciusmus**

01/25/2025 at 12:44 PM EST

what do you think of this: ## Civilizations and Cultures See more: [[Sembara]], [[Tyrwingha]], [[Addermarch]], [[Tollen]], [[Vostok]], [[Zimkova]], [[Duchy of Maseau]] This is a heavily peopled land. In the north, amongst the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], the [[Zimka]] people live a traditional life in the highlands of [[Zimkova]], and have formed three realms: [[Breva]], [[Lavnoch]], and [[Ardlas]]. South and east of the Zimkovan realms is [[Sembara]], a rich and powerful monarchy with a long history. Sembara is bordered to its south by the ancient fey-protected realm of [[Tyrwingha]], as well as the independent earldom of [[Addermarch]] and the [[Duchy of Maseau]], once under the suzeranity of Sembara, but now an independent land populated by refugees from the [[Isingue]] and the [[Plaguelands]]. To the east is the famous [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]] and past Tollen, the lightly populated coasts and forests of [[Vostok]]. There are two large and ancient lizardfolk settlements: [[Ozabal]], in the delta of the [[Wistel]], and [[Latazaro]], on the eastern borders of [[Tyrwingha]]. Beyond these settlements, lizardfolk are common along the river valleys. There are three major [[Dwarves|dwarven]] realms on the western borders, and dwarves are common in the human cities of Sembara, although there are no large, independent dwarven realms within Greater Sembara. Halflings are commonly seen plying their trade along the roads and rivers of the region, as well sailing across the [[Western Gulf]] and into the wider [[Green Sea]]. Although [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]] are never common, they too are seen in the cities of Sembara, although, like dwarves, there are no large stoneborn communities within the region.

i have some ideas to clean up the maps a bit, but won't mess around with that for a while and it is helpful to have the basic maps in there immediately

11:03 AM

yeah, agreed. i think writing good pages for everything will take some time



**Deciusmus**

01/25/2025 at 11:02 AM EST

At which point probably makes sense to merge

11:02 AM

But I don’t think I’m going to try to write good pages for all the regions, just basic stuff

11:02 AM

My main goal is to finish moving pages around, check and cleanup whereabouts that are wrong or broken, and make a basic landing page with each region, that has at least a map, the high level headings, and a sentence or two under each heading. This morning I got pretty far on a food greater sembara page

11:00 AM

All makes sense. I’m out with Dana and Z right now but have some time this afternoon I will probably work on this a bit (although I have a little bit of session prep for my game tomorrow as well)



**rsulfuratus**

01/25/2025 at 10:05 AM EST

i do think we should aim to keep the region pages to 1-2 paragraphs of text per subhead at most, and link out of broader descriptions if needed. e.g. for greater dunmar it would not be unreasonable to have a "geography of greater dunmar" page itself. the See more: [[link]] works pretty well i think when there is more detail than can be captured in 1-2 paragraphs

10:04 AM

i think the exact heading and organization can vary - for greater dunmar where there is a lot of geographic detail, might have a terrain heading; for sembara, the civilations and cultures might need to be expanded or reorganized somehow

10:03 AM

on the region pages: - the basic framework of the North Sentinels page seems great: major features, civiliations and cultures, history, and climate seem like the main useful headings we'll want - in previous region pages, i often included a lot of "what this place is like in the real world" detail. i think this belongs in dm notes, not player facing, but might want to have multiple campaign none blocks. the central highlands page has a lot of the kind of detail i find useful, but not organized well

9:59 AM

the one thing i might add is a "beyond the known world, rumors of..." section

9:58 AM

i like the basic style of the geography of taelgar page, can always fiddle around a bit but the basic idea is great and i think it highlights the right things

9:58 AM

poked around at the gazetteer reorg. i didn't make any edits as i don't want to get sucked into another taelgar project until i'm done with my multiverse rework, but i like the basic organization and framing. i don't know if it is easier to keep working in a branch for a bit until at least the basic framework for each region page is committed, but i'm fine either way



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 7:04 PM EST

**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 2:47 PM EST

I’d put northern and southern continent stuff in brainstorming, or maybe background

2:46 PM

I think Istaros Watershed should be “Upper Istaros” and the Istaros Watershed should get a top level page



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 2:45 PM EST

Istaros and Mahar are the same river, just different names



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 2:41 PM EST

My proposal was to (a) Make a folder for each of the regions in "region list" + eastern green sea (b) have a Faraway folder and put Far North/Far South/Omi in it (c) have a top level page for each of the items in the "big/cross region"

2:38 PM

Unclear if the Istaros-Mahar Watershed is really a thing, or if it is better thinking of the Istaros and the Mahar as two separate things, even though they do connect

2:37 PM

plus the features that are (a) big and (b) cross regions - Endless Ocean - Green Sea - ~Eastern Ocean~ - Sentinel Range - Chasa-Nahadi Watershed - Apporian Peninsula - Istaros-Mahar Watershed (but unclear given Drankor issues) - Yeraad River Valley

2:37 PM

plus the "borders" that bound the known world: Endless Ocean Far North Eastern Green Sea Far South

2:36 PM

here is what I have for regions Region List - Northwest Coast - Greater Chardon - Nevos and Apporia - Northern Sentinels - Central Highlands - Greater Dunmar - Greater Sembara - Istaros Watershed - Drankorian Hinterland - Northern Green Sea - Western Green Sea



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 2:32 PM EST

Nevos sea



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 2:16 PM EST

are the little islands south of illoria canonically in the nevos sea region or should I just draw a dotted ilne randomly?



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 2:15 PM EST

ah, sure. could call the region the Central Highlands (old region name)



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 2:10 PM EST

main issue is trying to avoid having both the sentinels (the mtn chain) and the sentinels (the region) have the same name



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 1:55 PM EST

Ursk would be best named after the forest, but that doesn't have a name. i think Northern Green Sea is fine-ish and I can't really think of anything better. it does include a significant stretch of coast. Maybe Northern Green Sea Coast?

1:54 PM

I think Sentinels is fine

1:54 PM

fixed the map. shared a new copy



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 1:43 PM EST

- Ursk/north green sea coast? Northern Green Sea kinda works but it is mostly not the green sea at all

1:43 PM

The other two slightly non obvious ones are - sentinels? It has a big stretch of forest to the west in it



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 1:42 PM EST

I think drankorian hinterlands better though since only a part of the region is the desolation but whole think was core drankorian

1:41 PM

Drankorian hinterland is fine, although desolation of drankor maybe a better modern name



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 1:40 PM EST

Wilds of Drankor?

1:40 PM

Ruins of Drankor? Desolation of Cha’mutte? Drankorian Hinterland? ??

1:39 PM

Very imperialist Chardon of you 😀



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 1:39 PM EST

Northwest coast better than Mawakel though and probably fine

1:39 PM

Neither northwest coast or Mawakel seem quite right. Maybe northern frontier is okay?

1:38 PM

I think Greater Chardon and Nevos Sea

1:37 PM

I’ll take a look. I usually export and then crop, or alternatively make a mask layer. ChatGPT is pretty good at photoshop instructions



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 1:37 PM EST

Second — names for regions most are obvious. A few questions Northwest Coast or Mawakel Region or ?? West Coast or Greater Chardon? Nevos Sea or Illoria or Southwest Coast?

1:35 PM

Before we mess around with regions more might be good to restore a backup ? I can reapply the region layer I think easily enough

1:34 PM

I’m messing around some more at lunch. First I think I accidentally cropped the map. I was exporting it cropped (to remove far north/far south) and I didn’t mean to save the crop but I think it auto saved



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 12:53 PM EST

but have to work now

12:53 PM

fiddled with the region borders a tiny bit to move the greater dunmar border to the height of land between the kharja and the kuthul in the east (approx), and to get all of the garamjala (more or less) in the drankor region



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 12:44 PM EST

now back to work - are you pushing this to your region branch? i might take a look later this afternoon

12:43 PM

might include the Nashtkar as a fifth topological feature. i never quite worked out the topography here but based on the rivers, if the Dunmari Basin is indeed now an endorheic basin, the Nashtkar should be at a higher elevation and separate the Kharja rivershed from the Hara

12:40 PM

re: Chataan Mts, agree it makes sense and the Dunmari aren't really mountain people, but the name is Dunmari - probably should come up with a Chardonian name at some point, or an ancient pre-Drankor name

12:39 PM

whether either/both still join the Istaros is canonically unknown, although if you had stayed with vindristjarna instead of exploring the tower of the collosus i would have had to decide as you'd have flown over the point on the map where the hara is shown to flow into the istaros

12:38 PM

historically Kharja and Hara are part of the larger Istaros watershed (both join the Istaros north of Drankor), but in the current day they probably should both be treated as their own watersheds, with the Hara a significant watershed and the Kharja likely not, with few/no tributaries

12:37 PM

re: borders, I think it is useful to have the Nashtkar, which is the rocky deserts north of the Garamjala, lower elevation and less dry (more american southwest than high andes desert) in greater dunmar

12:36 PM

the Chaudi can just get tagged directly to the region, probably

12:35 PM

(probably including the Shrev as well)

12:35 PM

Nayan Floodplains should really properly refer to only the region north of the Shrev. all that is made up of the south of the shrev "increasingly jungle density as you go south", more or less -> fairly different from the canonical savannah like / rice growing floodplains of the settled part



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 12:26 PM EST

Either way, from a rivers standpoint, the Greater Dunmar region has no mixed watersheds (although the map shows the Kharja and Hara joining, the text of both of the pages makes it seem like whether they do or not is unclear, and the gazetter would make more sense to have them unjoined and unclear)



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 11:59 AM EST

I havent' done it, but the "Greater Dunmar" main page simplies to define 4 major topological features of Greater Dunmar: - Yuvanti Mts - Nayan Floodplain - Darba Highlands - Dunmari Basin And borders: - Sentinels to the North - Nevos Sea to the west & south west - Mryani Gap to the west/northwest - Garamjala Plateau to the east The current region borders have Dunmar going all the way to the Kuthul River, but I'm not sure if that is correct and perhaps "Greater Dunmar" ends at the Kharja instead.



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 11:53 AM EST

So at a high level everything moves smoothly.... (a) Garamjala moves to ruins of drankor (b) Chataan Mountains moves to Greater Chardon (it was previously in Darba Highlands, but Darba Highlands was also defined as "the hills south of the Chataan mts, so I think moving is correct) The River Chaudi gets a bit funny as it is in the "Nayan Floodplains" which is now split across regions (north of shrev = dunmar, south of shrev = ruins of drankor).



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 11:17 AM EST

I might take a stab at dunmar re-org to see what it looks like

11:17 AM

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 11:17 AM EST

so i guess the main thing would be to always use synonyms instead of home/away

11:17 AM

i think a jury-rigged implementation is fine. i think the main goal would to be jury-rig it in a way that makes it possible to improve if someone cares to muck about with javascript, without having to edit frontmatter (beyond displayDefaults)



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 11:11 AM EST

I don't really have interest in mucking around in Javascript much; I guess my main question is... Does it seem worthwhile to have a working but slightly jury-rigged solution, which is based on the fact that (a) 90%+ of places are in a single realm + single region and will therefore not change (b) we care more about: having "realm" top level pages, "region" top level pages, and "watershed/mountain" top level pages being able to show the lists of places in those top level pages having a good set of landing pages than we do the exact "info box" text for a page (and in particular, we are happy to use page specific info-box text lines when needed, rather than trying to have a perfect general solution)



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 11:09 AM EST

i also like the style of the dunmar page as an overview of major countries

11:09 AM

fwiw, i like having overview geographic pages that focus on climate, terrain/ecology, and overall geographic features as a basic worldbuilding tool

11:03 AM

anyway, i'm going to be working on cosmology for a while yet, and need to write the cloudspinner adventure, so anything you want to mess around with on the branch is sensible

11:00 AM

maybe



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 10:57 AM EST

but from an "inside obsidian" standpoint I think the directory structure can be a bit fluid

10:57 AM

I agree that limiting how it is exposed (i.e. having a curated set of landing pages only, for example) might be nicer

10:57 AM

I'm not really sure the directory structure is the problem though. I actually think the vast majority of pages will fit neatly in the categories from yesterday, even if a couple span (i.e. the Chardonian Empire page is clearly in the "chardon" category, even though parts of it are outside), and there is a handful of pages that are "Top level" (Endless Ocean, Eastern Ocean, Green Sea, Sentinels) and then a handful of directories that don't match regions (mostly watersheds)



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 10:56 AM EST

like, maybe we don't actually want to have the whole gazetteer directory structure exposed in taelgarverse, and that might simplify things



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 10:55 AM EST

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 10:55 AM EST

the other thing wikipedia does a lot of is rely on landing pages, portals, and lots of list pages instead of a directory structure



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 10:48 AM EST

i.e. there is no concept of "location chains"

10:48 AM

poking around wikipedia a bit the big difference is that wikipedia makes no attempt to apply hierarchy to a page



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 10:48 AM EST

then there is the fact that rivers and mountains/hills tend to be added to the map even when other features are absent, so we have a lot of regions where there are a bunch of rivers and sometimes mountains but not much else



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 10:46 AM EST

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 10:46 AM EST

the goal is not that we need an in depth article on the geographic of sembara, defining a bunch of basins or whatever

10:45 AM

right, what i'm thinking is that, for example: - in dunmar, where most invention has happened in the central and eastern regions where people are nomadic, it is not super important to define political units; instead, a lot of my invention has focused around geographic features because that is what you interact with in game - in sembara, where the geographic landscape is kind of generic medieval european, most of the development has instead focused on political units however, we are trying to fit these into the same kind of hierarchical clustering



**Deciusmus**

01/24/2025 at 10:44 AM EST

I also think wikipedia is a little less template driven

10:43 AM

I think the main issue is that - unlike on Earth - we (a) don't want to fully define reality and (b) want to group pages by things other than the strict "region"



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 10:42 AM EST

poking around wikipedia a little and kind of wondering if there are some fundamental issues with our organization that make it more inflexible than we'd like, and lead to these conversations popping up and us fiddling with region definitions.



**rsulfuratus**

01/24/2025 at 10:27 AM EST

"Part of" might be fine for polity, actually

10:24 AM

I'm not sure I like "Ruled by" for the polity

10:23 AM

although if orgin == home you probably want just one line, "A river in (feature) -> (region)"

10:23 AM

second line: Located in (feature) -> (region) seems fine

10:22 AM

(although - something like the Gulf of Tollen is useful to place as a subfeature of the Western Gulf, so i'm not sure)

10:21 AM

(4) as for frontmatter, I think in general something like: if origin != home: - "A (typeof) in (origin)" first line - presumably never following a whereabouts chain so you only ever get the exact origin; i think in general this is fine because you typically wouldn't have multi-part part-of relationships; although e.g. the Western Gulf could be "a gulf in the Western Green Sea, Green Sea", that reads a little awkwardly to me and probably better to just say "A gulf in the Green Sea" - "

10:17 AM

(in part because i'm a little wary of leaving lots of half-finished frontmatter around)

10:16 AM

(3) this might suggest that initially we start with just the home/origin distinction, where home is just what it currently is, and origin is a "geographic partof" relationship

10:15 AM

and while for Sembara it is easy to say "a realm in Greater Sembara", for the Chardonian Empire what do you say? I guess just "a realm in Taelgar" if it spands multiple regions (separate issue is file organization)

10:15 AM

(2) what is the whereabouts for realms and how do subregions work? my guess is this stuff doesn't really work right but would be good to know. e.g., for a town in sembara, is there a way to generate a polity chain that goes "town -> barony -> subregion -> sembara"

10:11 AM

anyway just idle thinking

10:11 AM

but also there might be quirks or subties with how the chain of whereabouts works, e.g. since i think that always follows current location as you move up the chain

10:10 AM

i guess it is mostly a matter of getting the display right

10:09 AM

just a thought as I have no specific comment and its been like a year since i looked at the code. but for example, what happens if you set "region" and "watershed" but not polity on something?

10:09 AM

i'm not sure exactly what that would entail, but for example there is some wonkiness with items around "owner" vs "current location", and around "creater vs owner" if both are not specified. there are probably other edge issues

10:08 AM

i mostly have a lot of work today but taking a break for a bit before my next meeting at 11 am. throwing out a few ideas, all just brainstormiing. (1) the whereabouts framework is very powerful and we've sort of used it to overload a couple of things (creator and owner for items, for example; now partof relationships and regions). so far we've kind of ad hoc used whatever works for overloading, but i wonder if it would be worthwhile (and how hard it would be) to clean up the code a little bit so that this is easier. i

7:54 AM

I'm proposing the following aliases: region => alias for home with no date polity => alias for away watershed => alias for home with date 1 (I can't think of a good alias for "geographic feature" and I think it will mostly be used for rivers)

7:50 AM

I did a quick test before starting work and with one minor tweak it all works. The main question is what do we want the display text to be. I think it is easiest to use home for region and origin for watershed. Origin is slightly wonkier than other whereabouts so it might be better to use it for the special case. So my proposal is: A place that is part of a larger geographic system (rivers, mostly, but some parts of mountain ranges or the green sea as well perhaps) should have an origin location for the part of thing. All places should have a home location that traces back to the region. A place that is part of a political unit outside its region (or in its region, if it makes sense to be "part of" two things, i.e. the Copper Hills might be part of Darba Highlands and Dunmar) should have a away line for the political unit



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 11:16 PM EST

Thinking while brushing my teeth. You might want something like (would need to double check code so these may be incorrect): - type region: short hand for type home, end date 1 (so always set as origin and never home, even if home is absent) - type: subunit (or something) short hand for type: away, start: 1, end: 9999 (unless start or end are specified in which case use those), so always current location (home or origin would never be current location if they are different from away, I think) - partof: synonym for home but doesn’t set dates to anything in particular (shouldn’t be necessary I don’t think)



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 11:06 PM EST

going to bed now

11:06 PM

anyway, definitely worth fiddling with. i'm not doing any work on gazetteer pages for a while so good to mess around in a branch

11:06 PM

if we ues home for "watershed" you can even have the watershed of the Hara change pre and post Great War (if in fact the hara is now cut off from the Isatros), and things like that

11:05 PM

yeah, i am about to go to bed too. i think the basic idea of just overloading whereabouts is clever though and probably the right solution



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 11:05 PM EST

I like the idea of synonyms

11:04 PM

Yeah. Anyway I gotta go to bed. Might play a little bit in the branch tomorrow

11:04 PM

If some other river in say sembara doesn’t set anything but “whereabouts: sembara” all the queries still work because the whereabouts code knows that a single whereabout is home + origin + current



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 11:04 PM EST

i guess one problem is it doesn't allow origin to change, but realistically that should probably never change. but it might actually be better to swap that so the region is the origin, and home is the watershed etc

11:03 PM

that is pretty nice, actually. it might be worth updating the whereabouts code to accept some synonyms for home and away to make this a little bit clearer



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 11:02 PM EST

Then you could have different types of queries on different pages. Because the all merge nicely if they are the same it should be possible to have say: some river near voltara - origin: Chasa-Nedhi watershed - home: northwest coast - current: northern frontier of chardon Then the Chardonian empire page would show everything currently in, the Northwest Coast would show everything based in (home) and the watershed page would show everything from (origin)

10:59 PM

so if the convention is: - origin location is always the watershed/mountain range - home location is the region - political unit is the “current”



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:58 PM EST

so i guess for rivers or mountain chains the idea could be "origin" = "partOf" and "home" = "region" (or vice versa)?



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:57 PM EST

And the dataview queries already have the concept of querying for: - in a region - in or from a region (And would be trivial to extent a bit as needed)

10:57 PM

And different display text for different lines in the bio block

10:56 PM

So the whereabouts concept already has the ability to have multiple whereabouts

10:54 PM

Um, one sec



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:53 PM EST

i'm not sure I get that



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:53 PM EST

The other thought I had is home vs origin whereabouts might “just work”



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:52 PM EST

big political units could get the same treatment



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:52 PM EST

Hrm…



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:52 PM EST

mostly, this would be used for: (a) all rivers, that should always be part of a watershed, unless they are the only named river (b) mountain chains that span regions (I think only the sentinels)

10:51 PM

and then big features could have their own pages that span regions (we'd need a good file organization so you don't end up with lots of loose pages)

10:50 PM

so that you'd have whereabouts trace a unique path from most specific to least specific that should always end in a region

10:50 PM

then you could break up pages for big geographic features into multiple smaller pages (upper istaros, lower istaros), but have them all connected as partOf: Istaros Watershed

10:49 PM

i think that the ultimate solution would potentially be a partOf relationship for places

10:48 PM

and the istaros across 3

10:47 PM

whereas on the west coast the chasa-nahadi is actually spilt across 4 regions if you count all tributaries

10:46 PM

the longest river that flows into the green sea that is mapped is the ket, which is conveniently a border of a region



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:46 PM EST

yeah, its kinda hemmed in with the mostreve hills and the mountains and the ocean



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:46 PM EST

sembara also doesn't really have any long rivers



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:45 PM EST

so the geography aligns itself with the politcal and river systems in sembara better than in the west coast

10:45 PM

the problem is that whereas on the east/sembara land the big dividing line is rivers or mountains, in the chardon world it is forests and distance

10:44 PM

so actually the only major watersheds that spans regions is (a) the northern + southern Istaros are in two different regions, but also have very different characters (b) the Chasa-Nadhi and Yeerad river systems in Chardon



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:44 PM EST

yeah, we've gone back and forth on that a lot. i think it makes sense in the upper istaros



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:44 PM EST

I was thinking that Aurbez + Ardonne should really be in the Istaros region



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:43 PM EST

so i think it is worth playing around with to see if we can make it wokr

10:43 PM

i really like the framework of the landing page for each region and having more smaller regions makes it easier to write up good landing pages

10:42 PM

but then you won't put up those in a "list of rivers in XXX region" dataviewjs query, which is the main point of whereabouts



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:40 PM EST

well, arguably for rivers you actually want them to be in watersheds, which in turn are either in a region or "in taelga"



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:39 PM EST

i think that conceptually it is fine for things to be in multiple regions, and even from a file organization point of view it wouldn't be too bad. but it breaks our whereabouts system



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:37 PM EST

the river systems are a bit more of a pain

10:37 PM

(on the Sentinels, I think it is fine to have a couple of pages -- Sentinels, Green Sea) just outside any region



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:37 PM EST

yeah, although i think that could be finessed in various ways. river systems are worse because many of them span 2+ regions and it is tricky to break them up



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:36 PM EST

right it gets back to our conversation a long time ago about "part of" geographically vs "part of" politically



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:35 PM EST

Chardonian Empire is most significant region-spanning political unit. But also something like western Cymea is functionally a Tollen colony in many ways, but is in a different region. And parts of coastal Vostok are controlled by the Skaer, but are in a different region



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:34 PM EST

I guess the Chardonian empire



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:33 PM EST

i think (b) could be finessed by putting things in the most sensible place, but it kind of breaks the idea that there is only one chain of whereabouts. e.g., Voltara -> city in the Chardonian Empire -> realm in the Chardonian Central region (but Voltara is actually in the north region)



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:33 PM EST

For realms, they mostly all fit in a single region, right?



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 10:31 PM EST

it is very appealing. the only issue is it become a bit unclear what to do with: (a) geographic features that are larger than a single region, such as the Sentinels (b) realms or other cultural/political pages that span multiple features



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 10:14 PM EST

I've only really done the Far North and a bit of North Sentinels

10:13 PM

curious what you think if you get a chance to look

10:13 PM

I pushed a branch, new-region-format where I was playing around with changing up the regions in the Gazetteer to align with the regions we defined earlier and moving the intro text we have about each region to the region landing page



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 6:00 PM EST

ok if I didn't screw anything up the layer should be saved in the main map



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 5:24 PM EST

done



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 5:24 PM EST

you need to close it for me to open



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 5:23 PM EST

plus I have a backup copy of the map that isn't shared

5:23 PM

I added a new layer (borders -> region borders), if you just make sure that layer is selected you can draw on it and it should be fine. or you should be able to copy-paste your existing layer to the new file

5:22 PM

i think I locked everything on the map, so you can't really edit the existing image (except I think text, which is easy to fix if it gets messed up)



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 5:18 PM EST

I am doing this in photoshop but I'm scared to do it in the real map because I don't know what I am doing 🙂



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 5:17 PM EST

i can import as a layer to the photoshop file at some point (unless you are doing this in photoshop already)

5:17 PM

otherwise looks great

5:16 PM

for settled borders i'd push the northern border of the north sentinels up about 4-5 hexes, so it captures all of pandar, which extends for maybe 200 miles north of the mountain line just north of the forest of nightmares, or just make it dotted until the northern border of pandar is settled

5:14 PM

i'd move the upper istaros / Drankor ruins / western green sea line down to the Istaros tributary that comes from the eastern border mountains. south of tributary is Drankor ruins, north is upper istaros (west/inland) or western green sea (east/coast). the border mountains south of the river are Drankor ruins, north of the river are western green sea. reason is simply for ease of description, for the most part, and also because my feeling is that currently the desolation of cha'mutte is a little big and the south cymean world could reasonably expand into the mountains, but probably not too far south of that istaros tributary. but doesn't matter too much as that is obviously an unsettled border



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 5:10 PM EST

I'll move Chardon/Nevos, any other feedback? otherwise I'm going to number them and update the region map in obsidian

5:08 PM

green dotted lines are "this area is so poorly defined the regional boundaries are not clear"

here's what I have

yeah that is a good argument



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 5:06 PM EST

but of course as new things are made up those lines will always shift

5:05 PM

the advantage of moving it is it makes the canonical vs non-canonical clearer, i.e. it is a "canon exists north of here" line



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 5:04 PM EST

i'm not sure it matters too much either way. there are always going to be boundary regions

5:03 PM

yeah. although now I'm reconsidered whether the chardon line shouldn't include north apporia, basically a line from the southern end of the canal through the two hills to the coast



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 5:01 PM EST

and lake valandros remains a big blank spot

5:00 PM

for meta-game reasons, development in the north (voltara and surroundings) have proceded largely without much consideration of the south, except the chalyte trade links them

4:59 PM

yes, although actually this is all going to be reshuffled shortly due to the ongoing events in Chardon. there is actually an argumen that the Chardon region should really end at the northern extent of the Drankorian Empire, and that Voltara, Mawar, and the North Bay should be one region. Chardon would be the northern shore of lake valandros, nothwest along the southern edge of tawir forest, then along the mawar boundry mountains

**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 4:36 PM EST

and the part of the map that is drawn with boreal forest north of the ket is "far north"

4:36 PM

never decided what, if anything, should be in the blank space just north of zvervinka. probably that is "eastern green sea" (just extend the green line you have now to meet the ket)

4:35 PM

i'd put it along the ket (river that goes west from Zvervinka). that is basically the northern edge of Vargaldi territory and kind of marks "here be dragons beyond"



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 4:34 PM EST

with the cavaet that the line between "Eastern green sea" and "Far north" is actually totally arbitrary since this whole "far northeast" region is completely blank

4:34 PM

Last question is this the right dividing line between "ursk-ish" and far north/eastern green sea?

**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 4:31 PM EST

to the south, basically the "high desert" should be outside greater dunmar, with the line running Xurkhaz east to Kharja, then south, cutting across the southern edge of the Hara River Gorge (the only outflow from the DUnmari Basin), then across Yuvanti to the line of the Shrev. this splits historical dunmar a bit but makes a good dividing line in the present between "dunmar-ish" and "true desolation"

4:30 PM

the canal is clearly chardonian now, but the area is more nevos in culture. exact dividing line south of chardon TBD since that area is not invented. but for sure the canal should be nevos

4:29 PM

I think the Yeraad river valley is definitively not Nevos culturally, and better to keep the river together. the highlands towards Dunmar (south of the mountains) are Nevos; dividing line between Nevos/Dunmar is arbitrary - Darba was at one point Illorian, after all. the mountains should all be Chardon

4:28 PM

yeah

01/23/2025 at 4:28 PM EST

where c = chardon?

obviously the line between the upper istaros and the western green sea is pretty vague because nothing is invented in south cymea, but i think find to leave that vague, but include the "undeveloped historical insingue area" in upper istaros and the "undeveloped historical drankorian providence of South Cymea" in western green sea

3:04 PM

although i'd put the darkwood in sembara, it is much more closely tied to addermarch than the plaguelands

3:03 PM

yeah



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 3:02 PM EST

so sembara basically this:

**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 3:01 PM EST

that still leaves the plaguelands isolated as the only thing in a region that is basically the upper istaros. although perhaps orenlas fits in the upper istaros. actually, you could move xurkhaz to the upper istaros as well

3:00 PM

with this stuff moved to western green sea, i'd move irrla to eastern green sea. i think it works as the western edge of the "east" more than the eastern edge of the "west", if that makes sense



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 2:59 PM EST

right, which is fine, the goal of regions is really mostly to organize where blank spots are and such not to erect walls



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 2:59 PM EST

I'd put all of Cymea (west, "main", south) in Western Green Sea, even though it introduces some cross-region development w/r/t Tollen



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 2:59 PM EST

Ok, that works



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 2:58 PM EST

Western Green Sea then should be Skaer and Cymea

2:58 PM

I guess ultimately I'd put Vostok and Tollen in Sembara, and have the dividing line for Sembara vs Western Green Sea basically be the straights of Cymea. Vostok is not generally a mariner culture so they look more inward anyway



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 2:57 PM EST

Right that is true;



**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 2:56 PM EST

*west of the mountains

2:56 PM

but my sense is that the people on the east of the mountains are not generally putting themselves subservient to giants in order to gain protection from dragons

2:55 PM

Vimfrost's War is kind of an opening gambit in the Great War

2:55 PM

I think that northern part of Vostok is such a blank slate it is not straightforward to put it in a region. Vimfrost also impacts Sembara, of course



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 2:51 PM EST

which might align pretty well with S = canonically "Zimka-influenced" U = canonically blank: could be Zimka, could be brand new, might be related to the Vargaldi, etc W = Skaer/Tollen/mariner

2:50 PM

S = part of sembara U = "ursk" region, but actually perhaps a canonically "blank" area W = part of west green sea

2:50 PM

**rsulfuratus**

01/23/2025 at 1:30 PM EST

re: Cymea yes I think you are right, I had said something like that in the past (worth saving for an actual campaign to develop in detail)

1:30 PM

i'm in meetings until at least 2:30, but have a quick break between meeting 1 and meeting 2. but a few quick thoughts: (1) i think probably the undeveloped southern regions (south of the Shrev) fit better with 5 than with Greater Dunmar (2) i'm not sure that 5 and 6 need to exist separately? (3) Greater Dunmar should probably extend to the Mahar since historically e.g. Kharsan and other regions are central Dunmar; this also tracks basically the regions Dunmar Frontier traveled in. dividing like with 5/6 is "south of Xurkhaz, basically along the border of what is actively mapped. this distinguishes the Nashtkar, which is more rocky, from the high desert plateau of the Garamjala (4) south cymea does probably make sense to consider as part of Western Green Sea this however, leaves the plaguelands as basically its own region. maybe that should be merged with greater sembara? unclear to me



**Deciusmus**

01/23/2025 at 1:21 PM EST

The border is unclear, but I think it is canonical that there is basically some line that divides the plagueland from "remaining human civilization" on the shores of the western green sea, and south cymea + cymea are good to at least somewhat treat together

1:20 PM

Or even actually whether it would make more sense to get rid pf #4 and add it to Western Green Sea

1:20 PM

i.e. #1 - Greater Dunmar, basically the dunarmi basin + Myrani Gap up to the Kharia #2 Istaros River Valley, extending as far south as Drankor/Desoluation Around Drankor #3 "Eastern Drankor" basically the area south of the east branch of the Mahar #4 "South Cymea" basically east branch of Mahar north to the Cymean mountains

1:18 PM

I wonder if it would make more sense to consider: (a)

I'm reading that.

It feels like the kind of place that should be developed for a larger purpose than "passing through?

(at least for major overview pages)

9:18 PM

glad you like them. i think the style is really good for background lore like this. i was thinking for history, a more viable approach might be to extent and develop the thing I started to do with Cavarrio's Chronicles of Drankor. basically just focus on a single in-world scholarly secondary source



**Deciusmus**

01/22/2025 at 9:17 PM EST

**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 8:36 PM EST

i mean we already settled on that basic idea but it was still a little anchored to the "human belief -> outer planes"

8:35 PM

there doesn't have to be any unified creation story for the rest of the outer planes, and they don't all necessarily need to be "evils of humanity"

8:34 PM

then, you have the "spiritual realms' which are just "anything made of soulstuff"



**Deciusmus**

01/22/2025 at 8:34 PM EST

(and to add, defining what those things are as some sort of unknowa=nable mystery)



**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 8:34 PM EST

i think it also clarifies a bit the basic idea of the outer planes, although it doesn't necessarily answer all the questions about timing. basically, you have the realms of the embodied gods, created potentially during the riving for the Firstborn who are given physical form and presence by the power of Divine Creation



**Deciusmus**

01/22/2025 at 8:31 PM EST

That's not a bad idea; it actually ties together nicely with the divine spark and the nature of the Divine Presence all being interlated with what incorporeal gods are



**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 8:31 PM EST

but if anyone resurrected after ~10 days doesn't remember anything about what happened after they were on the plane of the dead, and you can't plane shift to the realms of the incorporeal gods, then in some sense they don't really ever need to exist as places that can be described

8:30 PM

people come back from the dead, and can describe their vague memories of the land of the dead, and brave/foolhardy adventurers can plane shift there

8:30 PM

I guess I would propose this is maybe something that, in-world, should be completely unknown and perhaps unknowable, and therefore unanswerable out-of-game



**Deciusmus**

01/22/2025 at 8:28 PM EST

Maybe it does work for them to exist in some sort of nebolous "plane of creation"

8:28 PM

So where do they exist?

8:28 PM

Right. I think the main tension is probably around the "pantheonic" gods like the Dunmari gods and Kaikeka, who both feel like entities that should have some kind of 'real' existence



**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 8:24 PM EST

so even in standard D&D models of cosmology is it never exactly clear where the gods actually live

8:24 PM

but also, outer planes in D&D are traditionally associated with alignment, not specific gods

8:23 PM

e.g. Greek gods

8:23 PM

i think the D&D-useful verions of mythological heavens all draw much more heavily from historical religions that conceptualized gods as much more directly interacting with humans, but being much less powerful overall than Taelgar gods

8:22 PM

i did at one point long ago develop a Dunmari heaven (this is the Arkaash stub) but i never really liked it so never used it in game



**Deciusmus**

01/22/2025 at 8:22 PM EST

But I agree the idea of some kind of Mos Numena heaven seems off

8:20 PM

My only real hesitation is that it feels like it kinda blurs the lines between different religious traditions in a way I’m not totally sold on

8:20 PM

I actually think it does solve a bunch of issues

8:19 PM

Yeah.



**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 8:18 PM EST

part of my thinking is that, if something has not come up in 5 years of running games in Taelgar, and also has not needed to be developed for any of the many extensive discussions of religion, maybe there is a reason



**Deciusmus**

01/22/2025 at 8:17 PM EST

Hrm…



**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 8:14 PM EST

the only thing that has ever been made up and canonically exists that is associated with a human god is Shakun's Realm, and that is a distinctly unusual place. it is not a place where human souls go in the afterlife, it is basically a trap for the enemies of Dunmar. so it could easily be an echo realm or a demiplane or whatever, much more like Cha'mutte's shadow realms than an Outer Plane.

8:13 PM

working on spiritual realms, now, and i'm actually not sure whether incorporeal gods should, in general, have planes. maybe this is what the original high school conception of the "all the gods are just aspects of the Divine Presence" idea means. Incorporeal Gods are, actually, manifestations of pure Soulstuff and to the extent they have "homes" it is the Plane of Creation itself. this might actually simplify some things: - where the souls of people who worship tanshi or kestavo go - the fact that we've never really had any lore about human "heavens" despite there being a lot of lore about non-human heavens - the actual metaphysical distinction between incorporal and embodied gods



**Deciusmus**

01/22/2025 at 7:12 PM EST

I'm going to eat, but I moved the "Metaphysics of Souls" to background with the idea that really, if we cleaned up the "Traditions Around Death" then traditions around death + the land of dead/plane of souls/soulstuff pages would replace it

7:06 PM

I pushed a few typo fixes and whatnot but overall I love it all



**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 7:05 PM EST

Yeah that makes sense. Obviously far realm psionics is different from eg soul knife rogue



**Deciusmus**

01/22/2025 at 7:00 PM EST

I think the Metaphysics of Souls page is probably obsolete almost entirely...

6:58 PM

As an aside, I wonder if a background page on "the typology of magic" would be useful

6:58 PM

Specifically, I've been running the psionic effects that Viepuck generates via his patron as very much NOT "plane of souls".

6:56 PM

I might rephrase that first bullet as something like: Although there is no specific definition of psoinics in Taelgar, any magical effects that represent a magical "inner strength" (such as monk focus, or certain types of psionics) would likely be a result of a particular "strength of soul" on the Plane of Souls. While there are not really any direct mechanical consequences of this, for flavor reasons it is worth keeping in mind that these magics are quite distinct from arcane magic or divine miracles. The flavor should tend towards drawing on the power of the soulstuff that resides within you

6:53 PM

Is psionics really necessarily powered by a strong connection to the plane of souls?



[**Deciusmus**](#1331771179958272072)I think what wasn't super clear to me is what is meant by the "conduit across the land of the dead". It implies that there is some connection between a divinity and soulstuff, right?



**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 6:46 PM EST

Yes

[**Deciusmus**](#1331768485973327934)that is a very Chaldonian idea, not sure if it has to be Taelgar canon, but if it is, this might be a good place to state it. If it isn't, it might be better to be a bit vaguer?



**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 6:40 PM EST

New text I think captures better: "While most theologians reject the idea that the Journey of Souls is simply the mechanical process of [[Soulstuff]] diffusing across a cosmological barrier, it is generally accepted that Divine power flows far more easily though the channels provided by souls, and that for deities to manifest the power of creation directly in the Material Plane often carries a great cost. Thus, it is through the conduit across the Land of the Dead provided by souls that most miracles occur, although there are [[Founding of Dunmar|dramatic exceptions]]. "

6:36 PM

(but all in onenote)

6:36 PM

ideally I'd like to do it in a similar way, with rumors and descriptions from various cultures, just haven't gotten to it yet. most of my invention aroudn the gidari is from the kenzo solo but i do have a lot of notes on at least one, potentially uncommon, "kind" of gidari



[**Deciusmus**](#1331768814874005505)Second: It is a bit unsatisfying to have the "see more" on gidari be mostly the same text, but I assume that is because there is no motivation to make the Giardi page better right now



**rsulfuratus**

01/22/2025 at 6:35 PM EST

I do have more notes on Gidari (dm_notes: important), just haven't updated that page yet

6:34 PM

my intention is not the strong implication of "gods cannot do anything without someone's soul to carry the miracle", but rather the weak implication of "it takes a lot of effort to directly act in the world and it is a lot easier to pour though the "channel" opened by a soul" (the example being Jeevali literally expended enough power in some sense to become un-divine to cleanse Dunmar of the plague curse - so it is not that these miracles don't happen but that this sort of things is costly for gods, potentially "deadly" in a sense)

6:31 PM

6:31 PM

specific comments.. Land of the Dead: * this sentence "it is generally accepted that the Divine cannot act freely in the world, and that it is through the conduit across the Land of the Dead provided by souls that most miracles occur. " reads a bit unclear to me. I think you are trying to capture the metaphyiscal idea that divine magic goes: God -> plane of souls -> material realm?

6:28 PM

A few comments as I read.... first, this is all really nice. It is a great format for this kind of topic, and makes me want to do the same sort of thing for some of the history (although that is much harder, but maybe doable for pre-downfall without too much work)



**rsulfuratus**

taking a break from cosmology to work on check/tim stuff. kate stayed up in Alexandria because she is taking an online class in London time zone (so 4 am to 12 noon roughly) and it seemed less disruptive, so i'm probably going to work on taelgar most of evening now that I've mostly wrapped up actual work



**rsulfuratus**

finished the top-level multiverse pages: - everything is now written in-world, with some different scholarly ideas - most pages have a campaign none section at the end for DM notes - planes are set to [place], groups of planes are set to [background] - everything has dm_notes: none I did not tag check/mike but would be happy with commets if you have any

oops, was just cleaning up a few things before bed and was messing around with the obsidian git thing and accidentally committed a bunch of unstaged changes I didn't mean to commit, mostly images of people in the DM folder + some rewrites of regions + human culture I wasn't sure about. If you see anything weird, it is revertable, but its probably easier to just carry forward, I don't think the regions + culture rewrites were anything bad just not projects I was planning on necessarily finishing soon

**rsulfuratus**

(i added the divine power chat to obsidian but not any of this history stuff)

10:12 PM

so maybe it was kobolds all along

10:11 PM

in the modern day, all i know about this place is the border area is rough and dangerous and notorious for kobold banditry



**Deciusmus**

**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 10:11 PM EST

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 10:10 PM EST

Right. From the perspective of the historical framework, all that matters is (a) the western frontier is along the Darba/Myrani Gap line and it stays that way for a while (b) when it changes, it changes fast and (c) from the perspective of post-Drankorian history, whatever was in the Mryani/Yeerad area is gone enough that it doesn't meaningfully impact post-Drankorian development



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 10:10 PM EST

(although it might not be dunmari any more depending on how the negotiations with karnas and chardon turn out)

10:09 PM

i think the main thing is this is not a fort established in support of the advancing army, darba is originally a defensive position, and naval focused (the fact that it is the one good dunmari harbor is basically because the harbor isn't dunmari)

10:08 PM

sure, maybe. it probably doesn't matter too much until someone sets a campaign in illoria / apporia



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 10:08 PM EST

I mean, not saying any of this is necessarily true or good, just saying, it could be anything

10:08 PM

or an anti-magical school of thought

10:08 PM

Maybe the Illorians were a second group of refugees from a rival school of magical thought or something

10:07 PM

Right. Could also be Illorians potentially



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 10:06 PM EST

i think the darba fort is against ~ something dangerous ~ in the Nevos Sea area, not humans. this is in 377, more than 200 years before the western conquest begins



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 10:06 PM EST

That preserves the possibility that it was a dragon or giants or an undead kingdom or something. maybe the western expansion was brutual because of whatever was in the yeraad river valley



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 10:06 PM EST

that's true



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 10:05 PM EST

I'm not sure it matters what was in the Yeraad River Valley pre-Drankor. The western expansion is already established as being fairly conquest/brutual compared to eastern expansion. So it is easy enough to say that from the perspective of modern day Yeraad, Drankor wiped the slate clean

10:04 PM

given the idea of darba as a fort - although maybe that is a fort against the giants or whatever, not humans at all

10:03 PM

although actually probably the illorians are the first people they encountered

10:03 PM

Right. It is the first people drankor would encounter going west, but who is there? well-established northerners? no one? lizardfolk? an ancient curse? Illorians? the weird people who end up in the apporian highlands after being driven out by drankor?



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 10:01 PM EST

the other spot that has always been a bit of trouble is the yeraad river valley, which is notably blank on this map

red is "no one"

10:00 PM

i'm sure there is a way to square that circle but it feels a little too pat to me

9:44 PM

(3) embry as a coastal city on founding is interesting, but pratically wouldn't it then suffer a lot? i might what are the odds the waters recede exactly to leave it as a river port after the downfall

9:43 PM

(2) i have a pretty clear - if vague - vision of cymea, and the main fault line is really northeast vs northwest vs south (will draw a map in a sec)

9:42 PM

but in any case, the initial expansion - when an island dumps a few million or more people at the mouth of this river - is not war or even assimilation

9:42 PM

(1) definitely more-or-less canon that the initial expansion up the istaros and across dunmar is into empty land. likely there is actually a degree of "drankorian + peronar magic restores the land that was devasted by the downfall", echoing perhaps a bit the "jeevali restores the land" although want to avoid that being a total cliche

9:40 PM

so, a few things



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 9:38 PM EST

it also sets up south Cymea in particular as being the most purely drankorian-successor state around, as the west coast had all these scattered humans as did the east

9:37 PM

not really committed to the specific details, but the idea would be: (a) pretty much all of the core lands that will become drankorian heartland have no humans at the time Drankor expands into the lands. (b) Tyrwingha is odd (c) Embry was founded as a coastal city (d) the northern Cymeans were mariner and there might be a bit of a cultural divide between north, central, and south cymea

9:34 PM

here's a slight different version - brown = human, yellow = elf, green = lizardfolk, blue = dwarf, light blue = green sea:

**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 9:22 PM EST

the brown is northerner

9:22 PM

the 4 grey circles are marniner settlements (well, one is tyrwinghan which might or might not be mariner)

9:21 PM

it all converges on Ulrich

9:21 PM

dark blue circle is dwarf

9:21 PM

yellow is elf

9:21 PM

green is the big swamp

9:21 PM

light blue is green sea

**Deciusmus**

You'd extend the western gulf up along the sembaran rivers (making Embry, with its pre-downfall origin, originally a coastal city)

9:07 PM

Totally different topic... but I was just messing around with the pre-Downfall situation, and it would actually work pretty well to have all of the major "Firstborn" races have massive civilizations that met at Ulrich Pass



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 8:44 PM EST

Could also tie into undead, and why turn undead works, and why you cant have undead clerics but you can have undead mages

8:43 PM

Hence the desire to conquer Hkar, and the need to destroy it

8:43 PM

Maybe the whole thing with the void mind is it cannot create soulstuff, it can only try to shape soulstuff that escapes from the divine presence

8:42 PM

Yeah. Actually this could tie back into hkar - maybe part of the magic of hkar was kind of an upwelling of soulstuff somehow, so that personal soulstuff was enough for magic. At least in the early days



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 8:37 PM EST

but of course, what is ki powers except kenzo using the power of his soul on the plane of souls to generate magical effects?

8:37 PM

for most "normal" species, their own "personal" soul stuff is not strong enough to generate magical effects

8:36 PM

So the only creatures that don't have access to divine magic are those that do not have soulstuff

8:36 PM

There is a whole idea that could be explored about how the actual source of divine magic is soulstuff not anything else



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 8:34 PM EST

Yeah I think that makes sense. Want to let it sit a little but am going to update land of the dead tonight and will copy this discussion and update the open questions



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 8:29 PM EST

That sets up this idea that whatever creation process existed during the riving the great wyrms and whatnot existed on the plane of souls. How that fragmented during the riving is canonically unclear but ultimately it means a fundamental divide between children of the riving - who get soul stuff “directly” - and after the riving - who get it from gods

8:23 PM

I think the metaphysics might work better if we assume that at least the plane of souls existed forever.

8:20 PM

(So back)

8:20 PM

(Was cleaning but done)



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 8:12 PM EST

(more in a bit if you are around, have to get Nathaniel to finish his homework)

8:09 PM

so that would imply the riving creates the land of the dead, but not the plane of souls which predates it

8:09 PM

i think i'm coming around to the idea that the plane of souls possibly always existed, and maybe the riving stretches the plane of souls into the astral plane and perhaps even creates the plane of creation as a home/embodiment of the divine presence, behind the wall of the land of the dead

8:08 PM

the riving creates the Firstborn, pulls apart the inner planes, but it was never really resolved how the land of the dead / plane of souls / spiritual realms come into existence

8:06 PM

and dominated by arcane magical energy

8:06 PM

so in that pre-Plane of Creation cosmology, the riving was effectively all the inner planes mixed together

8:06 PM

the original concept of the riving pre-dates the invention of the plane of creation as a nexus for the Divine Presence

8:05 PM

it isn't clear to me at the moment



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 8:03 PM EST

But one question that seems relevant - did the riving create the plane of souls and the land of the dead? What was cosmology like before the riving?

8:02 PM

I also like the idea of preserving unique possibilities and contingencies rather than having a complete typology or everything is exactly in a neat box

8:02 PM

I also like the vibe that none of them are precisely correct



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 8:01 PM EST

i kind of like the vibe that none of the speculation about the plane of souls in the in-world note is correct, but the hint from the fey idea of the dreamworld being the "real" plane of souls and the plane of souls being the echo ties into your suggestion as well



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 8:00 PM EST

I mean I’m not sure if elementals have a soul on the plane of souls necessarily but if they don’t they should have some equivalent

7:59 PM

Right. Why does that have to be wrong though?



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 7:57 PM EST

the original "children of the divine" logic actually got around this nicely by making fey/elementals/giants/dragons have a direct connection to the divine presence.



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 7:56 PM EST

Right. I think the vibe of any inner plane creature praying to a god seems … non standard



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 7:56 PM EST

but i guess that is different from "there is fey religion"

7:55 PM

**Deciusmus**

(About to eat dinner but will be around for taelgar stuff a bit later)



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 7:28 PM EST

looking at your comments on divine power in taelgar, perhaps easier to move to discord. i think the point about classification of magic into arcane/divine/primal is not so much about specific D&D classes, but about where on this spectrum things fall: (a) fey have clerics and divine magic works for fey similarly to humans; someone making a "fey cleric" character could reasonably be expected to think a little bit about what divine entity grants them power (b) fey have clerics that metaphysically / in-world access magic from the Plane of Creation, but not necessarily via the Material-Plane-Centric "divine powers grant miracles", suggesting an alternate route for diivine magic to manifest (c) fey don't have clerics. any player that wants to play a fey cleric would be assumed to be using the cleric mechanics to represent some other kind of in-world magic, and would be expected NOT to have a connection to a particular god or, put another way, do fey, in-world, pray to gods; pray in some strange fey way; or don't pray at all in any sense

however it is theoretically possible - if a huge pain - to create multiple text groups for different categories

1:55 PM

it is possible that a photoshop expert might have a solution using some advanced tools but if you just merge the layers they are converted to a raster image and you can no longer edit the text

1:52 PM

you can't really do that in photoshop



**Deciusmus**

01/21/2025 at 1:51 PM EST

It would be really nice to have the text layers be Major Geographic | Minor Geographic | Major Settlement | Minor Settlement rather tha each text on its own layer



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 12:37 PM EST

etc

12:37 PM

then if you have: bigGrid.littleGrid.column-row you get: Chardon -> H13.1.B-5 Karawa -> J15.3.E-4

12:35 PM

still you could label each column A-F, and then label the hexes 1-4 or 1-6, counting half-hexes as full

12:35 PM

pinpointing the exact hex is trickier on this scale, because each rectangle of 24 hexes actually splits several because of the hex -> rectangle conversion. but each rectangle has a regular pattern of 6 columns of 4 hexes, it is just the 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns are 0.5 hex - hex - hex - hex - 0.5 hex

12:33 PM

okay, updated with labels: each hex is 24 miles. each group of 24 miles is in a rectangle (~125 miles wide, ~96 miles high) each 3x3 arrangement of rectangles is labeled. if within each 3x3 grid we label the inner rectangles 1-9 (from top left to bottom right, so 1|2|3 (next row) 4|5|6 etc, then you can uniquely pinpoint each rectangle, e.g. Chardon is H13.1 and Drankor is L18.8



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 11:54 AM EST

if I made 3x3 grids, we'd have 23 squares across and 30 squares tall, so could label top with letters and side with numbers to have a bunch of well-defined quadrants


**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 11:52 AM EST

now that I have the basic illustrator/photoshop interactions figured out I could add thicker lines to make a regular grid that could be labeled. the whole world is 14400 pixels square. each existing grid is 210 pixels long, 161 pixels tall

11:50 AM

i added a continent scale hex layer (24 miles edge to edge). there are probably too many hexes for it to be straightforward to label them on this scale. however, each degree latitude is ~3.5 hexes, which is a useful scale, and it makes translating from smaller hex-scale maps to the main map a lot easier



**rsulfuratus**

01/21/2025 at 10:01 AM EST

not sure if that is shared or you have to set yourself

9:48 AM

I'm fairly busy today but I do have an afternoon meeting that is mostly other people talking but that I have to attend in case someone has a question for me, during which I might do Taelgar instead of work... My goal was to try to produce a couple of maps that outlined, for the "post Downfall", "height of Drankor" and "pre Great War": (a) where canonically various human and non-humans were (b) where the "intentional blank spots" are I've recently been playing around with Lightroom Classic, so I have temporarily switched my Adobe plan to the one that has Photoshop... So I was wondering if this would be easier if I just had the raw map Photoshop file?



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 5:29 PM EST

no need to decide now

5:29 PM

right so it isn't its own thing - it is either part of nevos sea or it is part of "potential apporia weirdness"



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 5:29 PM EST

And not sure I want to decide now

5:29 PM

But I’m pretty undecided between those two options

5:29 PM

My feeling is that another standard human culture doesn’t fit there. It is either something maigcal/weird that explicitly makes it hard for illorian culture to expand there, or it is illorian.



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 5:27 PM EST

I'm mostly just not sure if east coast of Apporia is "intentionally blank" or "nevos sea/illoria"

5:26 PM

plus "north bay/north of Voltara"

5:26 PM

for intentionally blank I have: Interior and west coast of Apporia

5:26 PM

for some canonical details but not entirely defined I have "northern realms" "nevos sea/illoria"

5:25 PM

for "defined" what I have so far is: Mawar Chardon North-coastal Apporia

5:25 PM

Really though what I'm trying to do is round out the list of "known" cultures in the west coast as between: intentionally blank defined * some canonical details but not entirely defined



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 5:23 PM EST

*intentionally

5:23 PM

I think from a human cultures point of view, you have a general Apporia / Illoria / Nevos Sea "vibe" that is very maritime, with influences from Venice, Genoa, and the Age of Sail. but lots of the exact history is blank, some parts intentioanlly

5:21 PM

I am pretty sure I intentionally phrased this as in-world lore in case I changed my mind about the original settlement of Apporia: "According to the records of the Chardonian Empire, the Apporian Peninsula was originally settled by the Drankorians, who originally constructed the [[Old Chardon Canal]] and established a series of maritime bases on the [[Gulf of Chardon]] and the [[Nevos Sea]], although never reached the western coast or the interior. "



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 5:14 PM EST

is the emerald bay coast of Apporia best though of as part of the Nevos Sea/Illorian cultural context? or is own thing?

5:12 PM

what I wrote in the canonical human cultures update I am working on is: ### Mawar The [[Mawakel Peninsula]] is home to a unique people worshipping their own version of [[Mos Numena]] and with their own unique language. The cultural derivation of these people is not clear, although many other documents assume Northern/Drankorian blend. Other possibilities could work, including a second set of Downfall Refugees or a intermixing of a unique pantheonic culture with Drankorian culture,



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 5:12 PM EST

there is actually a semi-developed ancient history there about elemental cults from one of the mawar adventures that i never typed up

5:11 PM

i like mawar a lot as a place and i'm kind of tempted to leave it blank for now, since it is a reasonable place i might want to set a campaign in in the future

5:11 PM

Mawar has always been a bad fit for a northerner origin, IMO, but i haven't developed its history in detail in large part because so much of the history of the west is a bit of a blank slate



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 5:09 PM EST

random idea: what do you think of Mawar not being founded by northerners at all (at least, not primarily) but by a second set of refugees from the downfall who didn't end up in Drankor?

5:04 PM

It is easy to link to h1/h2 headings though, so I might be inclined to just have a one or two open questions pages and link to headings as needed

01/20/2025 at 5:02 PM EST

i'm trying to finish the top-level cosmology tonight, just have some plane of souls and land of the dead clean up to do, but also this raises some open questions. is your idea that open questions pages should be relatively "big", that is, a series of cosmology-related open questions on one page, or should it be more narrow, e.g. a separate page for specific questions about the actual metaphysics of souls, vs the metaphysics of the land of the dead, etc



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 4:59 PM EST

I'm trying something a little bit different, which is to document (a) the rules - i.e. the established background of the migrations from Hkar (b) the existing cultures (c) the explicit blank spaces

4:59 PM

in the interest of "finishing" something I've switched from the grand sweep of history to trying to clean up a bunch of the notes on human cultures into a cohesive background outline.

nope, I was going to do the same

or at least, part southerner

3:38 PM

i.e. maybe Illoria is really Southerner

3:38 PM

I think there is more flexibility to develop Illoria if we leave it unclear where exactly the first northeners landed



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 3:37 PM EST

no



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 3:37 PM EST

is the idea that the northerns landed first in Iloria important to keep as canon?

3:36 PM

but it makes sense to say basically 5192 - 5300 is "the fall of Drankor" and a time of chaos, etc where we don't really try to define events per se. I don't see a ton of value in making up a lot of events in the chaos speculatively, although it is a good time period to place some kind of odd catastrophy or magical problem or whatever

3:34 PM

(drankor falls in 5192)

3:34 PM

its 5304 not 5204

3:34 PM

partly, I just did the math wrong and thought it was canonically immediately after the plague

3:33 PM

right.



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 3:33 PM EST

there is also a possibility for supernatural / magical events to come into play here

3:32 PM

we have some scattered dates - the First Duke of Sembara in 1142; the founding of Dunmar in 1171, - the suggest a kind of resurgence really not until the mid 1100s at the earliest

3:31 PM

so i think this could lead to a bunch of chaos for a while. you have refugees fleeing north and west and east; maybe Sembaran/Cymea declare themselves a new Drankorian Empire for a time but it breaks down / falls apart for various reasons (not the least of which might be the loss of important magical knowledge - e.g., Drankor helped keep things together with teleportation circles, but these are clearly lost magic now)

3:29 PM

i think the two things in my head here are: (1) the plague doesn't immediately curse the land. the city of drankor is haunted by the plague dead, and hard to survive in, but you have a kind of creeping corruption spread out from drankor, and over the next few years crops fail, cities die and are abandoned, etc (2) Apollyon was already in the process of centralizing a lot of things, collecting knowledge to himself, trying to suppress Mos Numena, etc. but his power base is very central, driven by the fact that all the important people in drankor are magically under his control. so there is already some tension between the center and the periphery.



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 3:26 PM EST

I guess it is probably more like a hundred years of unclear disruptions and resettlements



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 3:25 PM EST

i think the fall of drankor era is probably longer than 15 years. i mean, the immediate fall of drankor is very, very fast, basically just a single day when cha'mutte traps apollyon and unleashes the plague

3:24 PM

the vibe in the pre-great-war dunmari history is that they thrive on trade passing from isingue to chardon

3:24 PM

yeah in the high school maps we had that (with old names)



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 3:23 PM EST

but isingue and dunmar are presumably neighbors

3:23 PM

right, I think the exact borders here don't matter, as it is distrubted again with the Great War

3:23 PM

in the historical framework doc I'm working on I have the fall of Drankor being ~15 years, and had dunmars founding as part of that (short) era



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 3:23 PM EST

the exact borders are a little vague because it is not clear exactly what is happening with Isingue at this time, and how far south it expands, etc

3:22 PM

the founding is DR 1171 - DR 1173, roughly, and the dunmar probably expand to the modern "Dunmari Basin" plus some of the area stretching east to the Mahar (modern day Xurkhaz) within 10 years

3:18 PM

yeah the vibe is supposed to be somewhat like spread of islam right after the death of muhammad - very quick



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 3:17 PM EST

Right. So a canonical way of putting it might be: Shortly after the fall of Drankor, a new people, the Dunmari, sweep west, from an undetermined homeland somewhere east of the Drankorian sphere of influence. These Dunmari, speaking a unique language and worshipping their own gods, rapidly establish a new homeland - that they claim their gods have given to them - across the coastal plains * Whatever they are displacing - surviving humans? undead? plague demons? - is not clear, but by (XXX date) the sweap of land from (X) to (Y) is clearly Dunmari



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 3:16 PM EST

so the implication is that some people may have survived. or, possibly, it was undead, or plague demons, or ???

3:15 PM

but the vibe of the founding myth is supposed to be: - dunmari ride, driven by their gods, into what is basically a dying land. exactly how/why the land is dying is not stated, but presumably an aftereffect of the plague - jeevali performs great miracle to heal the land, makes everything better, dies, is reborn - the dunmari kill / drive out everyone who was living there, saying the gods saved the land for them

3:13 PM

re: drankorians - it is not necesarily clear how true the religious history of the dunmari has to be.

3:12 PM

the traditional three great rivers of Dunmar are the Hara, Kharja, and Mahar (Istaros), and the country is more or less founded on the banks of the Kharja. but the split could happen either at the Istaros (Mahar) or an eastern tributary



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 3:11 PM EST

the other question that came up on the dunmari migration is... were there any drankorians still in the coastal plain they were riding into? or is this meant to all be plague-scarred and depopulated?

3:11 PM

story/whatever

3:10 PM

But actually having the Dunmari homeland way out east simplifies alot of the Drankorian cultural history, as the Dunmari can just "appear" from nowhere basically, they were either on the fringes of Drankor or just far enough away that Drankor was only a legend



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 3:10 PM EST

it is not clearly determined, actually



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 3:09 PM EST

canonically the split was in the headwaters of that river that divides the yellow and red areas, right?



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 3:09 PM EST

that seems more logical



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 3:09 PM EST

So would it make sense for the dunmari homeland to be "out east" and after the split some of them went back towards the homeland?



**rsulfuratus**

01/20/2025 at 3:08 PM EST

it's never really fit with the vibe of Dunmar for there to have been a second branch of the Dunmari so close - it really only works if they are far/distant/lost somehow

3:08 PM

it

3:08 PM

although the split is canonical, i've increasingly felt it doesn't really make sense for the other part of the dunmari to have settled so close to Dunmar (e.g, red circle), separated only from Dunmar by Isingue (which is hardly a barrier)

3:07 PM

early on, i had the dunmari migration from undetermined homeland split, with some going ??? (variously, what we later called MTP or the red circle), and the rest continuing west to Dunmar



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 3:05 PM EST

the blue circle becomes Isingue

3:05 PM

the squiggly yellow presumably never recovers from the plague. Although it isn't clear to me where the proto-Dunmari were or came from or went to

3:04 PM

In fact, it is really only the red circle here that is poorly defined:

(d) is a gaping blank area in the history

2:40 PM

(c) and (f) have numerous open questions, but the very big picture is pretty well defined (although there are some questions as to when Illoria is conqueored by Drankor or really if it canonicaly should have been?)

2:39 PM

Of those (a), (b), and (e) are pretty well defined, at least in terms of the influence of Drankor on post-Drankorian history

2:36 PM

In particular, I think you can divide up the Drankorian world into basically six areas: (a) the core coastal plains including Drankor itself (b) the Istaros river valley (c) the Nevos Sea/Illoria/Apporia (d) the near Green Sea shores: South Cymea/eastern mountains/southern Cymea - the whole sorta ill-defined section along the south western Green Sea (e) Greater Sembara (f) the west coast

2:33 PM

(I guess you are probably driving or hiking or something, anyway.... back to Taelgar...) As I try to collate a lot of the history post-Downfall, there are some gaps that keep coming up as "undefined / undetermined" which make telling a cohesive narrative somewhat difficult. Some of the gaps are irrelevant or intentional, but not all of them.

Some day I’d like to make a canonical hexmap that would be easier to edit for things like regions, climate, working out changing borders/history, etc

1:29 PM

Maps are a bit of a mess. There is just one giant photoshop map with many layers that is getting a bit unwieldy. Plus I have some regional hex maps that occasionally have detail missing from the main map



**Deciusmus**

01/20/2025 at 10:30 AM EST

Is this all one photoshop file that you are pulling different layers out of?

10:29 AM

There is a world-map-regions and a world-map-climate both of which are a little bit different in the base layer and neither of which has the same base layer as the player map

10:28 AM

what's the status of maps right now? I was trying to make slightly better regional divisions than what we have right now, basically so that I could more clearly define what areas of the world don't have any defined history, or have only very specific single historical events

I'm basically structuring it as (a) a "historical framework" page that captures the major sweep of history, in a DM-facing tone (very similar to your "campaign none" DM notes) (b) a "open questions" page that lists unresolved issues (c) a "discussion" page that includes a lot of background and links to chats that provide rationales for why we ended up with the specific decisions we made as well as older since-discarded thoughts. This type of structure might only make sense for historical framework, as it is a somewhat unique topic, but am finding the open questions document a very useful way to organize undecided bits

3:44 PM

Ok I'm doing quite a bit of refactoring of the historical framework



**rsulfuratus**

01/19/2025 at 11:04 AM EST

Yeah I kind of like that. We are about to hike to the ledges but I’ll think a bit while we walk and if you feel like doing any reorg I’d be in favor of that proposal



**Deciusmus**

01/19/2025 at 11:03 AM EST

If we make a Worldbuilding\Open Questions folder it would then be easy enough to even have a MOC page that shows eveything that is backlinked from the Open Questions folder

11:03 AM

Maybe that is the best pattern, is to just create a "Wikipedia talk page" style "Open Questions" document for things where there are really fundamentally unsettled open questions and then link it from the main page

11:02 AM

Although I'd be tempted to split off some of the specualiation about how different religions see each others divine realms into a separate page - say a Worldbuilding/Spritual Realms - Open Questions or whatever

11:01 AM

but actually I'm not sure there is really a need, in the spirtual realms page, to tag it specially at all



**rsulfuratus**

01/19/2025 at 11:00 AM EST

Yeah for that I think framework pages are great



**Deciusmus**

01/19/2025 at 11:00 AM EST

so there is no page to put the campaign none block on

11:00 AM

for history I was finding that a campaign none block doesn't really work, because what I really want is something that provides a historical framework but doesn't define any actual events at all

10:59 AM

For cosmology, the campaign none blocks might be doing all the work, actually



**rsulfuratus**

01/19/2025 at 10:59 AM EST

Sure, I’ve been using campaign none blocks for this a bit. The distinction is I guess between pages where that information is largely complete (usually room for expansion but a settled framework) and where it is not (eg spiritual realms)



**Deciusmus**

01/19/2025 at 10:57 AM EST

For something like Cosmoslogy, we know that the spirtual realms are: Created in some fashion by "soul stuff" At least some of them are created by the human divine spark * Are related to the afterlife and gods But the details beyond that are perhaps a bit vauge. That's a good thing to capture in a framework page

10:56 AM

My idealize end state would be, for these types of big topics (grand sweep of history, religions, cosmology, human cultures, species), something like: The pages in (Cosmology, Organizations, History) are mostly "in-world", with some DM notes, and contain only canonical or mostly canonical information There are "framework" pages that provide both organizational meta-information (i.e. the "creating new species" document) and a place to capture known stuff in a more bulleted form especially when the known stuff isn't sufficient to create a real page (these would be in Background and should follow dm tag/status tag conventions but are also not as fully canonically as "real" pages) * There are brainstorming pages or folders in Worldbuilding for more speculative ideas

10:53 AM

I've been thinking about the same thing around history cleanup that I've been sorta working on



**rsulfuratus**

01/19/2025 at 10:53 AM EST

for now I put: %% OPEN QUESTIONS %% at the top of pages (so far just Spiritual Realms) that have open questions, and %% TO DO %% at the top of pages that have specific to-do task lists in comments at the end.



**rsulfuratus**

01/19/2025 at 10:31 AM EST

not likely to do a ton of taelgarverse cleanup today, but one question. working on cosmology and there are some pages that are hard to develop because there are unresolved questions, e.g., Spiritual Realms. the page is fine as written but the notes have open questions. none of our existing tags or frontmatter seem to capture this situation particularly well. there isn't additional information elsewhere in private notes (so no dm_notes), and the public text is correct, if shallow (so no status/needswork tags). status/cleanup doesn't seem correct either because the block is actual invention, not collation of details, etc. is this a situation worth capturing, and if so how? possibly just something like status/openquestions?



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 8:43 PM EST

Ultimately I think we decided the mechanics of portals are a bit unique and there is no particular reason one has to be "explained"

8:42 PM

we did have a discussion about it



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 8:42 PM EST

kate and i are doing the crossword now but will think a bit - i think we have some old discussion of this



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 8:42 PM EST

It would explain, potentially, the on-again-off-again portal, and the timing of it appearing after Cha'mutte's death is interesting.

8:42 PM

It occured to me maybe there is an extraplanar weak point to the fey wild in the Cleenseau Wood



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 8:41 PM EST

no - elemental planes as well



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 8:40 PM EST

do extraplaner weak points imply "outer realms"? I guess not, because Shadowfolds is mentioned



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 8:35 PM EST

really getting carried away with the in-world scholarship. just made up the Yendalist Heresy



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 6:22 PM EST

have generally not been setting status/check/mike, although feel free to review and send me comments on planar pages (should be obvious which ones are updated). did set status/check/mike for Far Realms.



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 5:26 PM EST

You can kind of piece together planar dualism if you squint

5:26 PM

But have to cook now. Enjoy the dangling links

5:25 PM

going to try to finish all the top-level pages tonight

5:25 PM

pushed a cosmology reorg



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 5:23 PM EST

yeah in the previous discord chat we decided to leave them in the background material for now, but that they were explicitly not in game terms



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 5:23 PM EST

i've been using (inconsistently) mythic history or days of myth for pre-Riving

5:23 PM

i think my feeling we shouldn't use "age of x" though

5:23 PM

yeah



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 5:22 PM EST

all sentient species, gods, etc were all created during the age of creation

5:22 PM

I am running a D&D game for Z and his friends tonight so Ive mostly been prepping, but I am also working on the refactor of history. The "age of creation" between riving and downfall works really well, because it is basically the age when almost everything was created

5:21 PM

Background of the Multiverse?

5:21 PM

Planar Concepts?



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 5:20 PM EST

cosmology coming along. one organizational issue - I currently have "top level" pages for multiverse, the fundamental planes that don't fit elsewhere; and then directories for echo realms, spiritual realms, and energy realms. however there are also a lot of random notes mostly about how the planes connect to the material plane (e.g., extranplanar weak points) or about the material of the planes (e.g., soulstuff). I guess these could all go into background, but some of them (extraplanar weak points for sure) seem kind of useful to publish, so i don't love that. however I can't come up with a good name for a subdirectory that is "misc stuff connected to planes but not actually planes themselves"



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 4:45 PM EST

yeah



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 4:44 PM EST

fundamentally the dividing lines are (a) riving and (b) destruction of hkar

4:44 PM

right



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 4:43 PM EST

that is, there was no interest in the creation of humanity being i.e. when the land of dead came into being or something like that

4:43 PM

But there is some debate in our discord chats about whether that is correct, or whether the creation of humanity was metaphyiscally significant. I think we agreed it wasn't, or if it was, it wasn't as significant as the riving or the downfall, right?



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 4:43 PM EST

(put it in the in-world style)

4:42 PM

someday i will probably do that but doesn't feel as useful as the cosmology stuff



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 4:42 PM EST

I did want to resolve the major "cleanup" note in the existing document, which is to restructure it to have only 3 "eras" rather than 4, i.e. (a) age before time (b) age of creation (riving - downfall) (c) age of humanity

4:42 PM

It should really be rewritten in your in-world style, but I don't have the time or energy for that

4:41 PM

I'm trying to organize/cleaup history a bit



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 4:10 PM EST

yeah makes sense to me



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 4:10 PM EST

i would like to propose we move all the cosmology pages that describe locations within a plane, as opposed to planes themselve, to gazetteer, in an "extraplanar" section. i'm going to be adding lots of places in the feywild and the plane of fire, at least, and they are much more in the style of gazetteer pages than what i'm trting to do with cosmology



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 3:56 PM EST

but also fine to just tag status/check/tim and let me deal

3:56 PM

i think something like that the implication is that the decline in power of religious orders was something i wasn't sure about and didnt come up in game. i think in that case - if is obvious - i'd leave a short comment like "potential reason for current day lack of funds: decline in power of religious orders" and otherwise delete the note



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 3:54 PM EST

Is that kind of note (a) worth keeping on the page as is (b) just delete it (c) move to a brainstorming doc (d) tag status/tim to see what you want to do

3:54 PM

The only bit that hasn't is a hint that the reason it had declining funds had somethin to do with a change in the power of religious orders

3:53 PM

I'm trying to clean up some %% comments on pages and move them to brainstorming. On for example the Sibyl's Hall page, there is an old comment from One Note, but it seems to have been mostly incporated into the page

3:48 PM

the dangling link to "planar dualism" is particularly juicy



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 3:48 PM EST

i am going to get carried away and invent tons of schools of metaphysical thought on taelgar i can tell



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 3:47 PM EST

I think that Astral Plane page is really good

3:46 PM

yeah, for the "counts" and "are all pages set with owners/notes/status" I wanted to exclude



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 3:45 PM EST

sensible. i think okay to occasionally stick a dm owner on brainstorming docs, but status tags and dm notes never make sense.



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 3:45 PM EST

I'm updating MOC to exclude worldbuilding from tag/dmnote stuff



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 3:42 PM EST

pushing now

3:42 PM

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 3:42 PM EST

did you forget to push

3:42 PM

not seeing it



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 3:41 PM EST

pushed a new version of astral plane, curious what you think about basic format of in-world scholarly discussion first, then a campaign:none block with "dm notes" and link to brainstorming pages



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 2:29 PM EST

the end state goal would be something like.... On pages outside of Worldbuilding, anything on the page should be considered canon. Exceptions would be explicit comments that state something as non-canonical. In general, if there is a lot of unprocessed or non-canon information about a topic, make a worldubilding page (or folder) and link to it (ala a wikipedia talk page)



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 2:28 PM EST

don't know how much i'll actually do this afternoon but we'll see

2:27 PM

my first project is going to be to reorganize cosmology to: (1) rewrite some pages in-world (2) move relevant pages from background to cosmology as needed, setting excludePublish (3) make a worldbuilding/cosmology directory for brainstorming info about cosmology, and move large comment blocks there

2:26 PM

comments are really only good for inline discussion, having a big wall at the end is a bit hard to read

2:26 PM

yeah i was thinking same thing



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 2:25 PM EST

My other thought was that for "big" pages (like say Sembara or Tyrwingha) that have lots of %% comments, it is better to move the %% comments to a Sembara - Ideas (or whatever) document in brainstorming, rather than just a wall of comments in the main doc



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 2:24 PM EST

i'm going to move background, but let you reorganize worldbuilding however you want, if you want

2:24 PM

yeah, okay, i think promoting background and then just treating anything in worldbuilding as non-canon makes sense



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 2:21 PM EST

Background is useful for random little canonical snippets that don't have another home though, I think. And also for more "meta" pages (Creating new Species)

2:20 PM

right, for some specific pages like that, sure



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 2:20 PM EST

the original idea was just to make it easy to exclude from export but that seems a little pointless now since we can just excludePublish["all"]

2:19 PM

i kind of wonder though why we have things like "divine order" in background instead of cosmology

2:19 PM

sure



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 2:19 PM EST

and keep worldbuilding for "work in progress"

2:19 PM

I was thinking perhaps the opposite, make Background a top level directory



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 2:18 PM EST

maybe it is worth promoting brainstorming to a top-level directory?

2:18 PM

one thing i was thinking about while driving up here is that i like the style of the Multiverse page, which is written with a bit more 'in-world' color. for things like people and gazetteer it doesn't necessarily make sense, but i was going to take a crack at rewriting a few of the cosmology pages in that style. i was thinking specifically for cosmology - planes, religions, gods - what I'd really like are: (1) "in world" pages for publication written in the style of the Multiverse page (2) background pages in the main document set to excludePublish["all"] that represent canonical information about cosmology/planes/gods that doesn't make sense to publish (3) brainstorming pages



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 2:12 PM EST

I'm poking around, will share ideas if I have any



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 2:12 PM EST

i'm open to ideas, i don't have any brilliant suggestions myself



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 2:03 PM EST

So pulling in all these emails and discord chats is making me think we would benefit from a somewhat better system from organizing "non-canon" background material



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 1:35 PM EST

I spent almost two hours at the bank trying to deposit Zachary's bar mitzvah checks but am now back home lookiing at this again

1:35 PM

and the 70% of it that is about git/obsidian/status tags/etc deleted (although I kept your version as the full chat log just for posterity)

1:34 PM

the full discord chat log is broken up into individual chats

1:34 PM

I pushed



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 1:34 PM EST

might do a little messing around this afternoon - can you push if you have done anything?



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 9:54 AM EST

Dana is working and Z has plans with friends so I am likely to spend most of the afternoon on this



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 9:53 AM EST

we are packing up now but i'll be on and off

9:52 AM

that sounds great



**Deciusmus**

01/18/2025 at 9:50 AM EST

And then use dm_notes only pretty much for stuff where either (A) I’ve made something up but haven’t written it down (B) I have private dm notes

9:49 AM

Then all shared conversations in brainstorming

9:49 AM

My goal was to have: status/cleanup/gameupdate and status/needswork/game update for cases where the only thing missing from the page is stuff that came up in game (In particular using that instead of dm_notes: color for the cases where the only thing missing is vibes or roleplaying notes that I invented on the spot while running the character)

9:46 AM

But yes, I think dm_notes for private info is where we should end up

9:46 AM

Yeah - I actually have been uploading emails as well. There are actually not that many of them.



**rsulfuratus**

01/18/2025 at 9:45 AM EST

we are going up to NH today so i don't know how much taelgar stuff i'll do or whether i'll be online much. was just poking around a little while kate does a quick errand, and thinking that getting discord notes into obsidian obviates a lot of the need for things like status/cleanup/external and the dm_owner: shared and all that. i think that everything from google drive is largely in obsidian anyway, and in any case that would be fairly easy to dump in there. the biggest question is whether it is worth trying to mass-download emails and put them in obsidian as raw notes, that seems a little more tricky. but if we had google drive, email, and discord as external sources in obsidian, we could drop all the tagging about shared external stuff, and just use dm_notes for private information from my old OneNote, emails with other people (mostly you to your players) and our separate dm folders in Obsidian



**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 8:33 PM EST

Might spend some time trying to reorganize brainstorming over tomorrow as well

8:33 PM

I’m almost done with processing the discord chat log. Will probably finish tomorrow as Dana is working



**rsulfuratus**

01/17/2025 at 5:03 PM EST

that i'd delete



**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 5:02 PM EST

what about cases where the text was basically just copied and pasted into another doc?



**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 4:56 PM EST

ok, I guess no real benefit in deleting in this case



**rsulfuratus**

01/17/2025 at 4:56 PM EST

i would just keep that. what is the benefit of deleting? i think there is actually some useful context in being able to check that because we often "clean up" ideas to read more like a wikipedia article for publication but having the more informal presentation can be useful to get a vibe



**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 4:55 PM EST

I like keeping the discord chat logs

4:55 PM

Which is fairly similar to what ended up in the main calendar eras page and I wasn't sure that the note was worth keeping

4:54 PM

The elvish note was: Elves fundamentally simply count ka. Nothing is really super-fixed within a ka, but ka are very regular. I kind of feel there is maybe something a bit fey here? Like the elves care more about the cycles of extraplanar energy and the waxing and waning of Aldanor’s influence than the sun. Maybe even call parts of each cycle Aldanor waxing or Elmerica waning. In some sense years are probably more analogous to months for humans, seasons are weeks, and there is no real sense of anything between a day and a season as being important to track.

4:54 PM

In this case, I pulled the Google Docs version of the Calendar Ideas into obisidian and split it up into dwarven/elven/hkar/drankorian brainstorming pages



**rsulfuratus**

01/17/2025 at 4:54 PM EST

perhaps we need a Brainstorming/Archive folder

4:53 PM

i kind of like being able to see how we came to a certain decision without having to dig in the git history. but it depends on the context. this is mostly true for things where the brainstorming doc has a lot of back and forth or captures an old email. i might just mark it as "%% Incorporated into [[note]]"



**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 4:51 PM EST

But I'm not sure

4:51 PM

my opinion is to just delete it

4:51 PM

What do you think about keeping around brainstorming material that has been incorporated into a note?



**rsulfuratus**

01/17/2025 at 4:41 PM EST

I have no strong opinions on brainstorming organization if you want to mess around



**Deciusmus**

**rsulfuratus**

01/17/2025 at 4:34 PM EST

for climate i tried to dump a bunch of emails and some of my old notes/wind maps into one doc

4:34 PM

e.g. for calendar stuff i added links in a comment in the Calendar Eras main page to a handful of calendar brainstorming notes

4:32 PM

worldbuilding could use a little cleanup, actually

4:31 PM

i was just working on that for climate



**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 4:27 PM EST

I might spend an hour trying to organize brainstorming/email/discord/etc around topics, i.e. make a Brainstorming/Calendars and pull everything that isn't canonical into it

4:26 PM

I saw that; I chopped them out of my tracking doc



**rsulfuratus**

01/17/2025 at 4:26 PM EST

ah good to know. i made a few notes, on dwarven and hkaran calander



**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 4:25 PM EST

are you doing any scraping from discord chat log at the moment? I added a "discord-log-edits" where I extract the stuff I've moved to a Discord Chat - Topic note

yeah

the discord log is actually mostly discussion of obsidian and git workflows, not actual worldbuilding

**rsulfuratus**

**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 10:08 AM EST

I’ll ask her. She was happy for me to publish them on my version of taelgarverse



**rsulfuratus**

01/17/2025 at 10:03 AM EST

doing a bit of cleanup of mos numena gods - Kiya has really done a lot of nice worldbuilding around ordinary people's experience of the divine. it would be nice to perhaps pick a few of those stories to share as sources in primary sources, with her permission.



**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 9:29 AM EST

I don't think I will update status much



**Deciusmus**

01/17/2025 at 8:50 AM EST

to the extent I'm doing stuff today I'm trying to pull in emails



**rsulfuratus**

01/17/2025 at 8:44 AM EST

my general interpretation has been that dm_notes should be used for private/non-shared notes, and if the only notes are shared, i've been setting dm_notes: none and status/cleanup/external

8:42 AM

pushed a bunch of stuff last night and this morning. i have a bunch of scattered 30 minute meetings today so probably won't be particularly coherent for extended discussion but will likely be slowly working on note cleanup throughout the day. will try to pull before doing any editing and push before going back to a meeting so as to avoid merge conflicts. my main goal is to turn everything that is shared,tim into joint or none depending on context, so those are the main notes i'll work on



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:55 PM EST

right. in my case at least the dm_owner: none / dm_notes: important are pages i'd like to finish and probably should finish. but yes i think that is a good interpretation



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:53 PM EST

One thought - dm owner is basically who is developing the incomplete page which is good. That means dm owner none / dm notes is basically a page you are “done with” but never finished, which is kinda fine and a decent way to think about it.



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:47 PM EST

there will probably be another round of cleanup / check/mike stuff, i'll tag you if i'm not certain (can also look at commit history)

9:47 PM

okay, i am going to spend 20 minutes or so on this, maybe more depending on how sucked in i get



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:46 PM EST

yeah



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:46 PM EST

but maybe better to just tag the "northern folk religions" page as joint

I'm going to go watch a show with Dana; but I actually think if we had (a) cleanup/external to mean there are external notes to find and copy in (b) dm_owner: joint to mean we are developing the page together (c) dm_owner: mike, tim to mean we are developing separately but want to coordinate It would be fairly clear. dm_owner: none then means either (a) the page is done and you have no further plans or (b) the page is not done but no one has plans.



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:46 PM EST

kestavo i guess to the extent it plays into the larger "northern folk religions"

9:45 PM

zimka i think is more you



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:45 PM EST

yeah that sounds right; plus kestavo and zimka unless you are leaving that as just mike



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:45 PM EST

(oh plus mos numena)

9:45 PM

not sure how much more i'm going to do tonight but i think the key "joint" things would be: - general feywild stuff (fey, feywild pages mostly) - languages & playable species - large-scale sembaran history - addermarch / tyrwingha / sembara top-level pages but not lower-level pages - elven stuff - deno'qai stuff



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:40 PM EST

sure



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:39 PM EST

i don't actually want to add another top-level status tag as i'd have to fix all the dataview

9:38 PM

we don't have cleanup/external, so could just use that



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:37 PM EST

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:37 PM EST

i would consider "look for external notes" to be more like "cleanup/incomplete" than "check" as it doesn't imply anything wrong with existing text

9:37 PM

i was actually thinking about splitting status. in a lot of the MoC stuff, i find myself wanting to do: active, stub, needswork, check, complete



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:36 PM EST

or status/check/external



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:36 PM EST

yeah maybe that is better. status/external perhaps



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:35 PM EST

rather than a dm_owner

9:35 PM

I actually wonder if it is better to have a tag for shared notes to import

9:35 PM

joint?



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:35 PM EST

so i think meta doesn't really mean meta, it just means "automatically relevant to multiple campaigns"

9:34 PM

compared to say addermarch

9:34 PM

although actually i'm now wondering about meta - because for example i think the Chardonian Empire, although "meta", is probably not really "meta" in the sense that i'm developing in relatively in isolation. same with dunmar



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:34 PM EST

yes, although some of those might have shared discussions to capture, right?



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:33 PM EST

for the remaining shared notes, i think i would change all playable species to meta by default, regardless. as well as kestavo, tanshi, and mos numena main pages, and mos numena gods



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:31 PM EST

pushed



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:31 PM EST

okay, i'm pulling now



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:31 PM EST

and fixes notes: none for a few other shared pages, and sets a couple to none/none (either discussed above or with status/tim)

9:30 PM

I pushing a change that sets the following to meta/none: Aldanor Region Map * a few random brainstorming pages that are themselves dumps of notes

9:29 PM

needed to go plug i my laptop

9:29 PM

one sec

9:29 PM

ya to a few



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:29 PM EST

did you add meta?

9:29 PM

and see what is left

9:28 PM

if you push i can look at changes

9:28 PM

probably i tagged shared meaning "meta" and didn't remember to update notes to important

9:28 PM

yeah



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:28 PM EST

i assume it should be important



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:27 PM EST

i have some notes, that shouldn't be none



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:27 PM EST

do you actually have notes? I don't think there was much shared dscussion

9:27 PM

ok I cleaned up, Undead ? It is shared,tim / none

9:26 PM

yes



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:26 PM EST

sylvan writing as well i think all the discussion is captured by the note

9:25 PM

no, that should be none/none



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:24 PM EST

A Story about Halfing Merchants? That probably doesn't need a DM owner



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:24 PM EST

looking at the "just shared" stuff there are a handful mistagged with dm_notes: none that do have dm_notes, and then basically three categories: - joint inventions for a game (e.g., armand, abelard) where it should be easy to just grab the notes and set to none/none - ongoing discussion (mostly sembaran history and elven stuff and deep world history) - meta stuff (gods, religions, species)



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:22 PM EST

yeah the notes shouldn't be none you are right



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:22 PM EST

i think that is shared because we have some discussion about it?



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:22 PM EST

I might just put it as none

9:22 PM

Highland Conquest Wars? Is that really worth meta?

9:21 PM

I'm changing dm_owner: shared / dm_notes none to meta mostly

9:18 PM

ok I pushed my updates



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:16 PM EST

you should change that, i do have a few random color notes so put shared,tim for now plus whatever you have

9:15 PM

no, that is probably just a copy-paste mistake



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:15 PM EST

is there a reason for that?

9:15 PM

wyrdling is dm owner tim whereas most gods are shared



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:14 PM EST

pushed MoC update



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 9:05 PM EST

MoC broken now but this search should still get shared pages: ["dm_owner":"shared"]

9:05 PM

pushed



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:52 PM EST

give me five more minutes

8:52 PM

yeah i'm doing it now



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 8:51 PM EST

are you fixing now? we shouldn't do it at the same time or we will have conflicts



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:49 PM EST

then i think anything that is meta-relevant gets changed from [shared, none] -> meta



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 8:49 PM EST

sure



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:49 PM EST

there are now only 91 shared notes after I moved the ones above to mike,tim i might just take 10 minutes and change them to shared,tim if I do have private notes then push, and you can do the same. then we'd have: shared shared,tim shared,mike shared,tim,mike should be easy to sort from there



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 8:46 PM EST

although I'm not sure about that second one

8:45 PM

or shared,tim if there are active discussions that need to be pulled into obsidian (i.e. emails or discord or whatever)

8:45 PM

I think meta,tim



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:43 PM EST

is that meta,tim? just meta?

8:43 PM

the only question is for things that have both ongoing discussion and some private notes (e.g., i made up a fair bit of mos numena backstory for the circular island that isn't incorporated yet), what do we tag them?



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 8:42 PM EST

agreed

8:42 PM

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:42 PM EST

i think in general there is no reason to have a shared / none category, since the main point of shared is a way to mark "this is something that we have shared notes not captured, but it isn't central to the world or anyone's campaign"



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 8:40 PM EST

for some larger pages, maybe meta / none rather than none/none



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:40 PM EST

yeah, i think that is correct



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 8:40 PM EST

(maybe with a check/tim)

8:40 PM

For Abelard, all I have on notes that isn't in obsidian is an image, which I am adding. Is it fair to say that for a page with dm_owner: shared if I add in all the emails or discord info I can find, it should become dm_owner: none, dm_notes: none?

8:38 PM

I mean, in worldbuilding or comments only, to be a source of stuff to mine and then delete



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:38 PM EST

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 8:38 PM EST

Do you think having raw copies of email threads in obsidian is valuable?

8:37 PM

I went through all the emails I could find, btw, and tagged them so I can pull them in



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:36 PM EST

yes, i don't think there are private notes for any of those. armand backstory is all in discord, artem in email. abelard less certain but i think email



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 8:36 PM EST

Actually, isn't shared meant to imply there are no private notes?



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:36 PM EST

artem for sure has a bunch of details that are missing

8:35 PM

those are all basically joint inventions and i wasn't sure all the notes were captured



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 8:34 PM EST

A few odd ones: Abelard Armand Artem Novolozek

8:33 PM

I think Tyrwinghan and Addermarch are probably shared/meta

8:32 PM

that seems right



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:32 PM EST

looking at shared dm_owner. I think the only ones that are really actually mike,tim (as opposed to shared or meta) are: - amberglow - duskmire - twilight's grace - twilight court - mostreve hills - the rangers - de brunes - dominion of avatus - vahaiya - pyravela maybe worth adding: - addermarch - tyrwingha



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 5:11 PM EST

will do some more cleanup later tonight, going to Nathaniel's winter concert now

5:11 PM

pushed some MoC updates that should hopefully make sorting through things easier



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 4:36 PM EST

yeah that makes sense



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 4:36 PM EST

I do think it is completely reasonable, if the only “missing info” from the page is from in game events, to tag status/needswork/gameupdate or status/cleanup/gameupdate and set dm_notes to none

4:34 PM

Yeah I agree



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 4:34 PM EST

basically: - name: that person or people has plans - shared: ongoing joint discussion - meta: central enough to be careful with major revisions (good for e.g. religions, world region pages) - none: no plans, not central

4:32 PM

i think that your suggestion at 3:04 pm is still the right way to start

4:31 PM

i'm not convinced that the campaign part is useful, as opposed to dm_owner: none, dm_notes: color, and a comment with relevant info



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 4:28 PM EST

Maybe forget the meta and shared stuff. But use owner = campaign as a shorthand for “the only notes are what I used in game”? Is that worth a special case?

4:27 PM

Not sure though

4:26 PM

dm_owner: shared, meta On the other hand would imply that the important notes were in discord

4:25 PM

These can be combined, ie you could have The Wyrdling dm_notes: important dm_owner: meta, clee That implies something important about the wyrdling came up in my game, and that major changes to the wyrdling should be pre-discussed

4:23 PM

What about reversing the meaning of a campaign dm owner, so that there are the following: (a) a campaign. The page was or is used in a campaign, and there is some information that came up in game (or in game prep) that isn’t incorporated - but the DM of that game has no further plans for the page. (b) person - private information exists and the person has plans (C) shared - all dm notes are shared (D) meta - the page is of broad important and is probably more a joint creation

4:18 PM

Ok, a few thoughts from the train back home…



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 3:12 PM EST

those are easy to clean up

3:12 PM

it is kind of a random bunch of things. i think a lot of pages where i have a secret that doesn't need to be secret anymore (e.g., Badya, Theba, Kisa, Godfrey of Marburgh)

3:11 PM

(excluding stub, needswork, check)

3:11 PM

these are none/important Divine Presence complete High Gods complete Land of the Dead complete Battle of Metium complete Battle of Shadowfire complete Cleenseau Spider Attacks complete Battle Against Wakog complete Yemo'te complete Copper Hills complete Duchy of Sembara complete Duchy of Telham complete Erelion complete Antaka complete Western Gulf complete Chronicles of the Mawar complete Theba complete Amay complete Badya complete Isha complete Kisa complete Nora Silverspark complete Caelynn complete Illaran complete Godfrey of Marburgh complete Azer complete Scroll of Storykeeping complete



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 3:09 PM EST

I'm in the office and have to go to a meeting but when I'm home I might look at the none/color to see what is there. I think I flagged a lot of stuff none/color

3:09 PM

i



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 3:08 PM EST

of which 10 are needswork/stub/check



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 3:08 PM EST

so then we are left with none / color and the question becomes is it really worth caring about none/color



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 3:08 PM EST

only 36 pages with that configuration



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 3:08 PM EST

(except for the dm_owner: shared as per above)

3:08 PM

but I also think that for notes = important, that is probably wrong. If you or I have important notes, it is probably wrong to not have dm_owner set - no one can use the page meaningfully as more than vague background without talking to the owner



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 3:07 PM EST

yeah but might not need frontmatter. dm_owner = none, dm_notes = color could just be handled with a comment



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 3:07 PM EST

I think there might be some value in a way to flag this as "i have notes but I don't care about the future of this page"



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 3:06 PM EST

right



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 3:06 PM EST

I'm not sure exactly, but it seems nicer to clean up dm_owner = none / dm_notes != none and dm_owner = shared first, and than look at what is left in the dm_owner = none, dm_notes != none



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 3:06 PM EST

yeah, maybe the campaign stuff is too much



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 3:04 PM EST

Then re-review and see if adding a campaign flag vs a person flag makes sense

3:04 PM

my suggestion would be, to start: review shared and move to mike,tim where correct review none to tag meta where correct * review dm_owner none / dm_notes != none for cases where the right thing is shared (i.e. the notes are all shared)



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 2:59 PM EST

and a dm_owner: shared could go from shared -> meta or shared -> none depending on the centrality of the page

2:58 PM

I also like dm_owner: meta - it is a good way to track "big" pages and is a nice constrast with shared, i.e. I would assume shared means = active conversations ongoing, or active conversations have happened in the past and are not incorporated in the notes meta means = restarting active development of this page probably needs at least a check/(other), but there is nothing active right now

2:56 PM

(b) you have unincorporated color notes and DO care about the place/person

2:56 PM

The basic problem I think is that it kinda breaks the goal of dm_owner originally. If I see a page from Adderfell campaign with dm_owner: tim dm_notes: color Does that mean (a) you have unincorporated color notes, but don't really care about the place/person OR

2:54 PM

I'm less sure about the campaign stuff...

2:49 PM

To start, I think shared vs mike,tim is a good way to distinguish between a shared page vs we both have notes

2:48 PM

I like the basic idea, but I wonder if the distinction between person and campaign is too much.



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 1:44 PM EST

(1) changing dm_owner (name) -> dm_owner (campaign) (2) adding dm_owner (name) to notes with dm_owner none and dm_notes != none (3) spending a little time reassigning dm_owner shared to either shared or some kind of combination (4) spending a little time reassigning dm_owner none to dm_owner meta

1:42 PM

from current system, would require:

1:42 PM

here is a proposal for an update to dm frontmatter, aiming to capture all three of the points above with two frontmatter items. dm_notes remains the same: none, color, or important none = no information outside the page color = non-critical information outside the page important = critical information outside the page it is fairly easy to expand this with more levels if we want (e.g., vibes between none and color), but i'm not sure it is necessary dm_owner gets overloaded to solve the issues with missing a way to capture "who has notes". specifically: - if the dm_owner is a campaign (clee, dufr, addermarch, etc), or a combination of campaigns, that implies "some kind of important context for the specific campaign" - if the dm_owner is a person (tim, mike) or a combination of people (tim,mike), that implies "not active in a campaign but the person either (a) cares about the development of thing enough to want to be consulted, or (b) has unincorporated notes" - if the dm_owner is shared, that implies "subject to active joint development" - note the contrast with, say tim,mike. shared = joint notes, tim,mike or clee,dufr = each of us has independent dm notes. - if the dm_owner is none, implies no one has important future plans - if the dm_owner is meta, it is like none but implies a certain degree of centrality to the page in this setup, should not have dm_owner none or dm_owner meta unless dm_notes also is none. things that have color notes but no future plans should be dm_owner (name) and dm_notes color, for example. dm_owner shared should only be used when the dm_notes are shared; if we both have independent development should be dm_owner mike,tim. things could be dm_owner clee,tim for example, but ideally these should be rare. not sure this is perfect but idea might be worth iterating on



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 12:28 PM EST

Right. I was just thinking something similar.



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 12:27 PM EST

in any case, more later

12:26 PM

it is really the (b) that is missing. e.g., there are things tagged dm_owner: shared that are really more "there are shared notes" not "we both have independent plans"

12:26 PM

it does seem like we want to capture: (a) who, if anyone, has plans for something (b) who, if anyone, has notes about something (c) how critical are the notes

12:25 PM

i have a meeting in 5 minutes and have to actually work until around 3 but will think on this a bit, might have more thoughts later.

12:24 PM

vibes could be a useful gradient between none and color

12:23 PM

it is very useful to me to keep dm_notes focused on "how critical is the missing information". i think discussions, in particular, obscures that, because it could be color discussions or important discussions



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 12:21 PM EST

But maybe (b) should just be none?

12:21 PM

(B) vibes-(campaign) (also name to be improved) which means the person or place came up enough in a game that there are some useful vibes or roleplaying notes that could be shared but they are not important and probably are not worth writing down, so ask, but the answer might be “ I forget “



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 12:19 PM EST

most of those are pretty easy to just copy and paste my onenote note as a comment and set the dm_info -> none



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 12:19 PM EST

I just wonder two additional categories might be useful… (A) discussions (name to be improved) which means that none of the dm notes are private and anyone who wants to dig through email discord etc and collate the notes on the page can flip to dm-notes: none



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 12:19 PM EST

but have no particular attachment or plans for the person

12:18 PM

there are a lot of none/color in People (106). a lot of those are people from early in the dunmar campaign i have notes on from onenote

12:17 PM

yeah that should probably be worked down



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 12:17 PM EST

202 none/color seems like a lot for example

12:16 PM

I’m almost at the office… but I wonder mostly about the shared and none dm notes.

12:12 PM

Right



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 12:12 PM EST

but i also set e.g. dm_notes: none on some people (e.g., the Strongbones, the halfling family that ran an inn in Tokra) that I'm sure I improvised something about two years ago but they weren't important enough to write anything down so, whatever



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 12:11 PM EST

Yeah.



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 12:11 PM EST

sure, that would be (1) in some sense



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 12:10 PM EST

Right. For me I often set “color” on people who have come up in play but where there is no notes about their personality in obsidian. But I’ve often just improvised that so I don’t have other notes to copy in



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 12:09 PM EST

so from that point of view, dm_notes to me implies a task list. but realistically a lot of this is likely never to get done, so it isn't like status/cleanup/incomplete

12:08 PM

in my ideal world, all of this would be copied into the page itself, either as public text, shared comments, or a secret

12:07 PM

for me, dm_notes means one of three things: (1) I have ideas about this note I want to write down, but haven't (2) I have external notes about this I want to copy, usually e.g. something like description or roleplaying notes for people from OneNote (if color), but occasionally images; for important this would obviously be more critical details (3) I have DM notes in Obsidian I should clean up I think (1) is by far the least common



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 12:05 PM EST

Ie does dm_notes: color imply an intention to record the color in the note? Or is it expected that it would stay color forever and at some point the color gets lost or forgotten and we decide who cares and change to none?

12:04 PM

More broadly though it is hard to tell if dm notes is supposed to be a “work list” or just a fact about the page.

12:03 PM

Actually the above is really the only example

12:03 PM

(A) pages where there is a lot of useful discussion outside of obsidian (either in old google docs or email or discord) where it would be valuable to just copy that in

12:01 PM

I think we have a handful of things that the current system makes hard to track..

11:58 AM

A few thoughts from the train…

11:58 AM

Ok I pushed a bunch of stuff



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 11:43 AM EST

i was distracted, working on a bunch of dataview tables (w chatGPT, surprisingly knows dataview pretty well) to better get as some of the data quality stuff, e.g. counts of typeOf details by descriptive tag, etc

11:42 AM

worldbuilding high school -> Campaigns/Great War is a good idea

11:42 AM

empty stub pages in brainstorming should be deleted



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 11:40 AM EST

any reason not to move high school notes to Campaigns/Great War?



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 11:33 AM EST

any reason not to just delete empty stub pages in brainstorming?

11:31 AM

i guess maybe it is

11:28 AM

Is setting dm owner on Worldbuilding/Brainstorming useful?



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 11:20 AM EST

I probably have a few too many tim/important

11:19 AM

(includes worldbuilding, which is where most of the missing/missing are from)

11:19 AM

dm_owner dm_notes count mike color 78 mike important 47 mike none 57 missing missing 93 none color 202 none important 36 none none 346 player important 38 shared color 6 shared important 69 shared none 15 tim color 138 tim important 487 tim none 28



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 10:30 AM EST

(I have to go pay attention to a meeting but then I'm heading into the office for a lunch so might share some thoughts from the train)



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 10:30 AM EST

or status/needswork/shared if the page itself is a mess

10:29 AM

i've been using dm_owner: shared, dm_notes: important for that



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 10:29 AM EST

I have a meeting, but my quick though is that we are missing a good way to capture pages where there is active shared worldbuilding that isn't captured in the obsidian note



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 10:28 AM EST

(4) I've been going fast to just get things tagged so a few things may shift, but i feel pretty close to having a fairly complete "state of taelgarverse" system in place. just want to try to clean up stubs next

10:27 AM

(1) for big meta pages, I generally default to none/none, except for things like the world map (dm_owner: tim), and a few other places where i care about the text specifically (2) for a lot of things (e.g., cosmology, time), the distinction between shared and none is a bit unclear. i have tried to used shared for things where there are active discussions about canon, none for things that are blank slates or settled. but may not have been perfectly consistent. fine to change things, just drop a check/tim (3) i have actually been finding tagging dm_owner in worldbuilding can be pretty helpful. since these are all dm_notes, i am trying to tag dm_notes: none unless there are additional brainstorming docs elsewhere, or i haven't fully written down my thoughts. (High School Notes are the exception, of course)

10:24 AM

have nearly finished dm frontmatter for all pages, but need to take a break now to work briefly. another super-quiet day though so will do more later. I 've been tagging dm frontmatter for essentially every page, as I think it can be helpful, although obviously Campaigns is silly. a few notes incoming



**Deciusmus**

01/16/2025 at 9:27 AM EST

cleaned up all but 3



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:35 AM EST

23 files left in gazetteer that need dm frontmatter, mostly Sembara or Istaros so for you to set



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 8:10 AM EST

fyi a much faster way to add dm_notes than the MoC pages is in search: -["dm_owner"] path:Gazetteer



**rsulfuratus**

01/16/2025 at 7:52 AM EST

i'm aiming to finish adding dm_notes before considering other options. however, i think setting status/active could be a reasonable option for those pages



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 10:34 PM EST

An example here is Tavoise or Beury. The notes are pretty complete at the moment but color is constantly being added

10:30 PM

I'm about to go to bed, but I wonder if there is a better way than dmnotes: color to capture: this is a minor place in an active game, so the vibe is likely changing and shifting as the game plays, and that might not be fully updated here Is that just dm_notes: color? It makes it hard to ever "finish" adding color notes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:54 PM EST

so - none

9:53 PM

I don't have any particular dm notes



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:53 PM EST

last group w/o dm frontmatter

9:52 PM

dm_frontmatter for zimka? dm_owner: mike, dm_notes: ??



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:20 PM EST

I think if there is nothing important cross-regional Id say none



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:17 PM EST

separately: what to do for dm notes for things like Eastern Green Sea Region, where the page is basically a stub and I have dm notes for component pieces



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:14 PM EST

I don't expect it is exactly every 25 years; 25 years before 1749 is 1724, which is close enough to my game I could plausibly have one, but also easily enough to say it was in 1718 or 1726 if needed



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:13 PM EST

i would definitely make Twilight Court canon. i think the feywild needs something like that and it is perfect for Ethlenn's vibe



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:13 PM EST

doesn't matter and in fact the timing is pretty good

9:12 PM

but if you want one in dunmar, grab it

9:12 PM

unclear



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:12 PM EST

does it matter?

9:12 PM

or unclear?

9:12 PM

when was the last Twilight Court in your game?



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:11 PM EST

yeah, I was envisioning something like that

9:11 PM

He is also ambitious and would love to build something to rival Ethlenn's domain



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:11 PM EST

i think an interesting vibe for that would be for it to be kind of neutral ground. Ethlenn doesn't do feywild politics, so all the other archfey find her parties a safe place to do their own politicking



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:11 PM EST

Umbreath would totally travel anywhere he is invited; he was originally a master of games and ceremonies and craves glamor

9:10 PM

There is this idea of the Twilight Court, which is noted as unclear canon, but happy for it to exist if it is a relevant idea, which is imagined as a huge party she throws every 25 years or old, inviting all the powerful fey, that is elegant and fancy



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:10 PM EST

how about Umbreath? he has obviously expanded some into Amberglow territory, or at least what used to be minor realms associated with Amberglow, and he is at least concerned enough with his western borders to cooperate with Shimmersong



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:09 PM EST

And I think she is somewhat unconcened with what happens outside her borders, although not entirely unconcerned. But I think she is more concerned with what happens in the mortal world than the feywild

9:09 PM

except - rarely and not in a long time - to go to Tyrwingha

9:08 PM

I don't think she ever leaves Twilight's Grace



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:08 PM EST

what does ethlenn think of that? does she go to the "Archfey parties" so to speak? (probably not real parties - but for example the Chanceweaver had people from Shimmersong at his court)

9:07 PM

what is your take on her role in wider feywild politics. e.g., there is this unknown "bad fey place" (Sharpspire) in the sentinels that leads to occasional strained cooperation between shimmersong and duskmire



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:06 PM EST

yes definitely



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:05 PM EST

separately, my impression has always been that -- for reasons undetermined -- she has a small domain with strict borders that she maintains (and is perhaps unusually strong for the size of her domain - not that those necessarily correlate), but her domain has never really shrunk/grown much in a long long time



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:05 PM EST

all the fey would have seen her, no problem

9:05 PM

and is not hidden at all

9:05 PM

Yeah, she holds court in Twilight's Grace all the time

9:04 PM

yes



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:04 PM EST

but there are obviously plenty of fey that go back and forth, it isn't like she is hidden _in the feywild_, just doesn't really come to the material plane often



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:04 PM EST

but it isn't like she is hidden or has not ever appeared to anyone

9:04 PM

but in the last 100ish years she hasn't announced herself and paraded around Talofwern and held court

9:03 PM

and probably or likely appeared one or two other times in the early blood years but haven't defined that

9:02 PM

the vibe I'm going for is... She obviously appeared and walked around and was very public about it around the time of Derik I's ascention to the throne and the founding of modern sembara

9:01 PM

that is not canonical

9:01 PM

right, I missed that



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:01 PM EST

unless it is clearly indicated as "not necessarily canon"

9:01 PM

i wouldn't set it is cleanup/incomplete if there is dubiously canonical information even in the comments

9:00 PM

yeah



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:00 PM EST

ah thats in the %% bit



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:00 PM EST

treaty of tyrwingha



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:00 PM EST

what note is that in?



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 9:00 PM EST

for Dunmar / feywild politics in 1749



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 9:00 PM EST

Ah



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:59 PM EST

is that true?



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:59 PM EST

which moment



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:59 PM EST

particularly this: "Although Ethlenn herself has not been seen or heard for generations"



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:59 PM EST

for dunmar feywild arch or your addermarch game?



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:59 PM EST

actually - side note - i kind of need to know what is going on with Ethlenn at the moment



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:59 PM EST

but it is actually hard to capture the right status

8:58 PM

(d) I have lots going on with Ethlenn so flagged it as dm_owner: mike even though it is kinda a shared event

8:58 PM

(c) the off-page info is all shared

8:58 PM

that page is (a) accurate if light (b) has lots of off-page info and discussion



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:58 PM EST

yeah that could be just considered incomplete



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:57 PM EST

a better example might be Treaty of Tyrwingha

8:56 PM

maybe that's a bad example

8:56 PM

true



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:56 PM EST

we talked about kind of new england style governance and to me it feels like it might be more of a alliance as in Commonwealth than as in "ancient Greek" or whatever the classic "group of city-states" is



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:55 PM EST

I guess maybe not



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:55 PM EST

e.g., was it an alliance of city-states?

8:55 PM

there was a lot of interesting discussion about isingue that hasn't propagated through the pre-Great-War politics of that area

8:54 PM

i'm not convinced what is written there is canonical, fwiw



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:53 PM EST

for exmaple, Istabor Alliance



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:48 PM EST

there probably aren't too many of those but worth looking



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:41 PM EST

I'm looking at status/needswork/shared and moving to status/cleanup/incomplete when the only reason it seems to be needs work is because it doesn't feel like enough for the important of the page

8:38 PM

pushed a bunch of status/mike cleanups



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:20 PM EST

Whereas dm_notes: important might not be a high priority to update

8:19 PM

status/cleanup can be kind of a task list, doesn’t have to be controlled completely. For me cleanup/gameupdate is mostly for notes I wrote and then events changed context and I want to remember to update the note

8:18 PM

I mean I have several pages with both



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:15 PM EST

I'm not totally sure what the different between cleanup/gameupdate and dm_notes: important is

8:15 PM

sure



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:14 PM EST

but i think it is always going to be a judgement call for the page author,

8:12 PM

my logic is basically: - Fausto's death is a major world event and upends a lot of things in Chardon, and I want to capture that - Casian needs a bit of text cleanup to make the note properly reflect his last adventure and death but doesn't really affect his usability and he has a died frontmatter - Kaeso although developed a lot is really still just a "minor but relevant Dunmar Frontier NPC"

8:11 PM

for context, i put: - Fausto -> status/needswork/gameupate - Casian -> status/cleanup/gameupdate - Kaeso -> no status (well, metadata cleanup), dm_notes: important



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:10 PM EST

I think yes, right?

8:09 PM

I had the tag as status/update, but is it better to just do no status and dm_notes: important?

8:08 PM

separate question: a page like Jaques Bellemont (the duke of wisford) is quite light on details, but the 2 sentences that are there are fine. I wrote the page before he came up in play and now there is a lot more world info about him



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 8:07 PM EST

but, e.g. The Battle for Uzgukar despite <1 session is worth having imo

8:07 PM

for Dunmar Campaign I have mostly only made event pages for multi-session things, and that highly inconsistently

8:06 PM

i think event pages are most useful for things that either would gather a lot of backlinks and are central enough to write a narrative that is more general, or span multiple sessions



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 8:04 PM EST

better to just link into session notes?

8:04 PM

what is your thought on event pages for "minor" events? i.e. the spider attack page



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 7:57 PM EST

just pushed some status/mike fixes



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 7:56 PM EST

going to try to clean up stubs for a bit to reduce the number

7:55 PM

made this change and pushed



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 7:37 PM EST

honestly, status/active isn't crazy for major NPCs either. For example Odo Cordorwaner is a pretty active NPC who has a character sheet and comes along with the party sometimes



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 7:36 PM EST

*that

7:36 PM

yeah, i like taht



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 7:36 PM EST

the biggest value is actually distinguishing between PC pages that are "historical" or where the game is over or otherwise potentially more npc-like, vs those that are active PCs

7:36 PM

maybe status/active is good for PC pages that are actively being played for right now



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 7:35 PM EST

yeah, i guess i just need to think a little about how i actually use pc pages



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 7:34 PM EST

That is, isn't dm_owner: player, dm_notes: important doing all the work? If the PC is in an active game, one of us is running the game, and can change the status to status/needswork/gameupdate if needed.

7:31 PM

I am not sure that PCs need special treatment



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 7:00 PM EST

going to try to remove stubs first if there are easy ones, and do dm_notes, and then maybe look at check/cleanup

7:00 PM

right now have: - 102 check - 226 cleanup - 70 needswork - 320 stub - 10 update (PCs)

6:59 PM

status/update now just has PCs, which might need a new status home? created some more status/check/mike



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 6:29 PM EST

adding status/needswork/continuity for things that have the right vibes but might have continuity errors and should not be relied on. could have this as status/check/continuity instead, don't have strong feelings



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 6:07 PM EST

Yeah that right



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 6:07 PM EST

(or update instead of gameevents)

6:07 PM

vs status/cleanup/gameevents

6:07 PM

status/update maybe is even wrong, maybe it is status/needswork/gameevents

6:07 PM

yeah



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 6:06 PM EST

Probably should also use cleanup/update when there are non-critical session updates and keep status/update for things like “Apollyon is dead now”

6:05 PM

status/cleanup as a catch all for anything that someone wants to Improve in some way is kind of nice actually



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 6:05 PM EST

I like that



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 6:05 PM EST

Maybe just cleanup/incomplete would be fine

6:03 PM

Yeah something like a could use improvement tag



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 6:03 PM EST

but obviously there is a ton of stuff about hkar in the "world-lore" in our heads (mostly yours) and in a lot of random other docs in obisidian, and a useful project would be to pull that together into a better page. but I don't think Hkar should stay a stub until that project is done

6:01 PM

Hkar is a good example. Adding a single sentence like Hkar is known as the possibly mythical place of creation of humanity, and humanities first homeland. It is said to have sunk during the [[Downfall]] feels like it captures the essential info about hkar for a player in my game, for example

6:00 PM

I think a landing place for needswork and stubs that indicates: "this page is accurate but missing significant stuff and it deserves more work" is useful



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 5:57 PM EST

My order of operation is (1) fix needswork (2) add dm front matter, (3) deal with stubs, (4)! Deal with update



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 5:56 PM EST

But I think it is highly valueable to turn stubs into non-stubs, and it should never need more than 10-15 minutes

5:56 PM

right, I mean transitorily, good to move to stub as a landing spot. I did the same with some needswork/wip



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 5:56 PM EST

But probably will move out again once I look more closely

5:55 PM

Yeah maybe. There are a handful of pages that were needswork that I moved to stub for now



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 5:54 PM EST

right, but isn;t dm_notes:important sufficient?



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 5:54 PM EST

But maybe doesn’t need to be

5:54 PM

I have a ton of notes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 5:54 PM EST

but for something like the Great War, why is that status/stub?

5:52 PM

that is, a page like Sembara or Chardonian Empire that would take significant time and effort to write up, but that should be written up

5:52 PM

I think that it is potentially worth having a tag for "project" pages

5:51 PM

ignore that

5:51 PM

oops

5:51 PM

ortant does a lot of work. Something like the page on the Chardonian Legion



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 5:51 PM EST

current stubs with more than 20 backlinks: File311 Folder Backlinks Humans Species/Children of Divine Creation 380 Sembara Gazetteer/Greater Sembara 207 Great War Events/1500s 130 Chardonian Empire Gazetteer/West Coast 62 Deno'qai Groups/Cultures 39 Hkar History/Pre-Downfall 26 Govir People/Dunmari 22 Embry Gazetteer/Greater Sembara 21 Ra'ghemdros People/Other Nonhumans 20

5:50 PM

Chardonian Empire is in the same boat

5:49 PM

or maybe that should actually be needswork

5:48 PM

so maybe we need another tag for that

5:48 PM

but it would take a few hours to really make a solid page

5:47 PM

there are also things like sembara which I set as a stub because there is literally just a map in public text

5:47 PM

the downside is those take a lot of time to clean up individually

5:47 PM

i have a decent number of things that are status/stub because i have a lot of DM notes so a one-sentence page is kind of misleading



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 5:46 PM EST

as I see status/stub as basically "I'm not done making the initial page"

5:46 PM

I agree with the cavaet that for places in particular that definitively exist with a name, getting rid of status/stub is valuable



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 5:45 PM EST

capturing dm_owner: shared / dm_notes: important is the key thing to mark as "there are shared docs about this"

5:45 PM

my inclination is to lean against status/needswork unless the page really is bad to use, but the distinction between: - no status - status/cleanup - status/stub is a bit arbitrary

5:43 PM

yeah, i think that makes sense.



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 5:42 PM EST

dm_ower: shared, dm_notes:important?

5:42 PM

Zimkova is an interesting page... there is lots of details we've discussed few of which are incorporated into the page, but at the same time, nothing on the page is wrong per se, and nothing has come up in my game or my private notes



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 5:29 PM EST

that kind of thing is probably a fairly high priority to copy as a comment to the note in question, fwiw

5:28 PM

yes, i think in general "dm_notes: important / dm_owner: none" is a fairly clear signal of that kind of vibe



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 5:26 PM EST

what about: (a) I have made up important details as part of creation of history (b) that might not be super well documented in Obisidian (c) but I'm not sure how much it matters if they are canonical as they haven't really come up in game (d) but I like the details, at least as a starting point is that dm_owner: none, dm_notes: important?



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 5:18 PM EST

in this case (the Duchy of Wisford) I'd like the page to be published



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 5:18 PM EST

i guess maybe most important decision is if you want minimal information on page published or not

5:18 PM

status/cleanup/text vs status/stub is a fairly arbitrary line, i think up to the author which is a better vibe



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 5:17 PM EST

a page where (a) I have made up important details in game (b) I would like to have a better page (c) the existing minimal info on the page is correct dm_ower:mike, dm_notes: important, status/cleanup/text?



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 5:15 PM EST

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 5:15 PM EST

dm_owner: none, dm_notes: color?

5:15 PM

cleaning up a few check/mike's.... What is the right way to capture "I have a few thoughts on color, but nothing recorded, and nothing that I care that much about"



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 3:26 PM EST

also working on that



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 3:26 PM EST

honestly a very useful thing to do with be for you to set dm_owner where it is missing



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 3:21 PM EST

I think the check stuff is all cleaned up now too. will tackle status/needswork now. no one has shown up to office hours



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 3:20 PM EST

ok, I gotta focus on work for a bit but I think I got most of "my" pages with status/needswork/external or status/needswork/wip to something more sensible



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 3:18 PM EST

he actually will likely resurface shortly. put dm_owner: tim for now



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 3:17 PM EST

Caulaus would be dm_owner: none (as opposed to Artem) because I don't actually care about him in the same way. Or should I set you as dm owner?



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 3:17 PM EST

i'm putting all the kestavo pages as status/needswork/old

3:16 PM

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 3:16 PM EST

say?

3:16 PM

and Artem would be dm_notes: important, dm_owner: shared



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 3:16 PM EST

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 3:16 PM EST

rather than needswork?

3:15 PM

the page is fine, but there is some worthwhile information in email that would be good to migrate to discord. I guess it is dm_notes: color?

3:15 PM

hrm, here's one - Caulaus



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 3:12 PM EST

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 3:11 PM EST

so say looking at my 3 ausson's crossing pcs, it should probably be no tag (Izar), and stub on the other two



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 3:11 PM EST

in all cases should have: - dm_owner: player - dm_info: important except for guest players who explicitly turned over their pc to the dm, where dm_owner can be the correct dm

3:10 PM

i would probably say either: - stub, if they are obviously incomplete - more or less permanent status/update, if they are being actively updated as part of a campaign - no status if they are complete enough for reference and used primarily for e.g. backstory

3:09 PM

esp because how they are used varies from person to person and campaign to campaign

3:08 PM

i'm not sure. some of them are obviously stubs; others are complete-ish. in general it is not obvious exactly how much information should be captured on a pc page



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 3:07 PM EST

what are we doing for status on pc pages?



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 3:06 PM EST

for stubs makes sense to always have dm_owner (and change once stub tag is removed if needed), since a stub is hard to use without talking to page author for details



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 3:06 PM EST

yeah, makes sense



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 3:06 PM EST

it isn't perfect but i think the idea is it is more useful to communicate lack of future plans/ownership, and we should be able to figure out who has the notes without too much trouble



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 3:05 PM EST

is the idea that dm_owner: none, dm_notes: color - we will know who has the notes?

3:03 PM

I also fixed all my status/needswork/wip pages to be status/stub or status/cleanup/text depending

3:01 PM

I pushed a bunch of status/check/mike fixes

2:57 PM

I pushed a few checkmike cleanups

2:54 PM

Twilight Court maybe just stays status/check/mike+tim

2:53 PM

so for example Kestavo is probably status/needswork/shared

2:53 PM

status/needswork to me implies more work than just reading something



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 2:52 PM EST

don't care, just checking on intention



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 2:52 PM EST

but moving to cleanup is fine if you'd prefer



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 2:52 PM EST

can leave it



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 2:52 PM EST

I was using status/check/whereabouts specifically for cases where I added whwereabouts but needed to check the dates



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 2:51 PM EST

looking at status/check. - status/check/whereabouts assume can be merged with status/cleanup/whereabouts? - things that are status/check/mike and status/check/tim with note about reviewing for correctness. leave, or move to status/needswork/shared?

2:49 PM

okay, finished status/cleanup



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 2:45 PM EST

so that would be one reason for status/stub rather than no status or status/cleanup/text



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 2:44 PM EST

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 2:44 PM EST

status/stub is still useful to prevent publication to taelgarverse it occurs to me



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 2:41 PM EST

or honestly doesn't need a status tag at all imo. i would say: - status/cleanup/stub only if you have more infomration to add - status/cleanup/text if you think it should have a nice page but you don't want to write it now - no status if you don't think it needs a nice page

2:40 PM

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 2:40 PM EST

As per the notes above, the difference between status/stub and status/cleanup/(whatever) is flexible, right? so i.e. the Ferrystones, if I didn't feel like writing something "nice" could just be status/cleanup/text, given the %% block of info contains everything I've made up?



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 2:38 PM EST

currently working on correctly splitting the refactor into cleanup/metadata and cleanup/text

2:34 PM

finished cleaning up "status/cleanup": - a dozen or so status/cleanup/internal moved to status/check/mike with a note - about 100 with metadata cleanup needed, largely things I want to add campaignInfo for or that need whereabouts updating. i did not try to retag these - 22 in text that have various comments about rewriting - 13 in refactor that have various comments about refactoring necessary (refactor vs text is a judgement call) - the rest images or maps



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 1:38 PM EST

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:37 PM EST

So I think what we are saying is basically 5 status tags: stub: original author still working; page is not "real" yet; should have dm_owner needswork: page is wrong cleanup: page is fine for in game use, but something is not quite good enough or is missing for it to feel "done". subtag might say what needs fixing. check: page is fine but something needs to be checked; subtag might say what needs checking update: page was good; now needs updates from ingame events



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 1:34 PM EST

(i'm running office hours until 4, so far no one has shown up but that could change)

1:34 PM

i'm trying to get all the descriptive tags squared away now but then will turn to status tags unless i get unexpectedly busy this afternoon

1:33 PM

ah yeah that was probably right



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:33 PM EST

I think status/cleanup/external was a precursor to dm_notes



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 1:33 PM EST

since dm_notes is more direct about "do you need outside information"

1:33 PM

from a tag point of view

1:33 PM

but the distinction is probably meaningless

1:32 PM

i think at one point status/cleanup/internal = lots of comments to fix and status/cleanup/external = lots of backlinks to check

1:32 PM

yes



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:32 PM EST

I think the theory is that any page with dm_notes: none and no needswork tag is completely documented in obsidian

1:31 PM

actually, status/cleanup/text probably makes more sense than status/cleanup/internal



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 1:31 PM EST

yeah. maybe needs a generic status/cleanup/text as well



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:31 PM EST

as would say status/cleanup/campaigninfo

1:30 PM

I would say that nested lots of options under status/cleanup is fine... status/cleanup/metadata status/cleanup/map status/cleanup/whereabouts status/cleanup/image status/cleanup/internal all have pretty obvious meanings to me



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 1:29 PM EST

but maybe status/cleanup/metadata is better than status/metadata/header



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:29 PM EST

either do status/cleanup/metadata or status/cleanup/whereabouts

1:29 PM

Ah, I wouldn't bother with that



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 1:28 PM EST

actually meant 4 level. e.g. status/cleanup/metadata/whereabouts



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:28 PM EST

I think 3 level is valuabe here



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 1:27 PM EST

but it could arguably be a subtag of status/cleanup, i just don't like three-level tags

1:27 PM

i think i argued we should have that separate because sometimes you don't feel like working on text but e.g. collating campaignInfor or whereabouts

1:27 PM

i kind of like status/metadata as a key for "non-writing cleanup"

1:26 PM

nothing



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:26 PM EST

What is the difference between status/cleanup/whereabouts and status/metadata/header?

1:25 PM

Right. So in the top level list above, the only one that isn't clear to me is "metadata"



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 1:24 PM EST

e.g. if there are 10 pages that "deserve" status/cleanup it might not be worth subtags

1:24 PM

although again i'm not sure it is obvious until we get the tagged cleaned up in the first place

1:24 PM

I do like status/cleanup/internal a lot



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:24 PM EST

Right, that seems reasonable



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 1:23 PM EST

i'm not sure we need a predefined set of status/needwork subtags. i do think status/needswork/old and status/needswork/decision might be useful. my goal is to get the status/needswork number down to those pages that are actually incorrect and then it might be more obvious what we need



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:09 PM EST

(c) is there value in "canonical" subtags under cleanup? In particular, is **status/cleanup/internal** valueable to indicate that all information is in the page or its backlinks but that the page itself might need work to rewrite and so on

1:08 PM

A few questions and notes: (a) do we need a status/needswork/decision or status/needswork/canon to indicate that the page is blocked waiting on deciding whether something is true or not? (b) do we need a status/needswork/old or status/needswork/outdated to indicate that although there has been no specific conversation, the page feels like it doesn't reflect current thinking? (i.e. the issue isn't that there are notes or discussions that contradict the page, but just it feels inaccurate/wrong?)



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 1:01 PM EST

So I think broadly that would mean something like... **status/stub** Page is missing stuff the page author thought was critical, and should be considered non-canonical. Should always have a dm_owner. **status/update** The page was accurate at some point, but in game events have caused it to be out of date. Should generally have a dm_owner and should be fixed as a priority. **status/needswork** The information on the page is contradictory or wrong (not just incomplete) and the page should be considered non-canonical. May not have a dm_owner and may be particularly common on big topic "shared" pages. Should be categorized as to the source of the "correct information": internal (other pages), external (private notes), shared (discord chat, email). **status/metadata** The metadata info is missing, out of date, or could use improvement. The page is accurate though, although for example the current whereabouts might be wrong. Often won't have a dmowner but ideally would have a note as to what is wrong or missing. Subtags are not canonical and we might use different ones. **status/check** Some specific fact or part of the page needs confirmation but in general it is accurate. Should not be used when a page still needs work. **status/cleanup** The page is good enough for in game use, but something about it is lacking or could be improved or fixed.



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:42 PM EST

On status/needswork and status/wip stuff. I think what we discussed last night makes sense, which to formalize, should be something like: The original page author should keep it as status/stub until they are happy enough with the basic info. We don't have any specific rules on when you change it away from stub - it could be after adding header, it could be after adding a sentence, it could be after doing more. But that means pages with status/stub should be considered basically as "not yet real" at some level (and should be high priority to fix, and should always have a dm_owner)



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:26 PM EST

I like being able to get all the mosnumena stuff

12:26 PM

I would keep those



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:25 PM EST

have a meeting in 6 minutes but one more question on categorization tags to wrap that up. religion is the other tag that has (i think complete) subtags. seems kind of useful to keep these? or better to just convert to frontmatter? i'm fairly agnostic although slightly inclined to keep



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:22 PM EST

that 1700s page is actually pretty cool although it is slow to load



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:22 PM EST

ah, okay. then yeah i'll delete event-source and just recatogize anything that doesn't have a top level tag



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:21 PM EST

to see it working

12:21 PM

you can look at Events\1700s\1700s

12:21 PM

across all pages

12:21 PM

it just looks for lists with DR values

12:21 PM

I actually am not sure it is worth keeping, as the code I have right now doesn't seem to use it



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:20 PM EST

ah, okay. that is worth keeping though. so anything that has another tag already should be event-source, anything that is an event should be event



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:19 PM EST

but I'm not sure if I ever finished the code for that and I'm not sure it really works

12:19 PM

whereas event is a "page categorization" tag

12:19 PM

On question 2: event vs event-source. The original idea was that event-source could be added to OTHER pages that had tagged events in (DR:: yyyy) format to build automatic timelines



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:13 PM EST

i already did a lot of refactoring at one point to clean this up so I think it is actually pretty straightforward to tag the page as written as either a specific thing (equipment) or a generic class (other)

12:12 PM

the tricky ones are actually things like the mirror of the past, which i haven't decided if it is a generic item or a specific item unique to eudomes. but the page is clearly written about a specific item, so it gets item/equipment, and if this becomes a generic class of things then there are two pages, one for Eudomes' mirror of the past and one for Mirrors of the Past (in general)



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:11 PM EST

makes sense

12:11 PM

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:11 PM EST

the page is clearly written about the class of items. if there was a page for "Delwath's Horn of Silent Alarm" that would be item/equipement



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:11 PM EST

right so "items/equipment" means "a page for a specific thing"



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:10 PM EST

i think items other



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:10 PM EST

right, I just mean are they items/equipment or items/other



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:10 PM EST

so at the moment i have decided against having pages for the specific instances of these things



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:09 PM EST

or scroll of storykeeping

12:09 PM

there is a rough edge around generic items, i.e. horn of silent alarm or drankorian message stones

12:07 PM

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:07 PM EST

right, so in this categorization equipment is not precisely equipment, but rather "something you could list on your character sheet"



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:07 PM EST

and being able to look at all items/other in isolation might also inspire some further organization



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:06 PM EST

ah, hmm, that's not a bad idea



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:06 PM EST

the javascript doesn't care about subtags, and it means the data is organized if we ever did want to do the javascript header work

12:06 PM

items/equipment items/vehicles items/other

12:05 PM

an alternative would be to make 3 subtags



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:05 PM EST

but that would probably involve a lot of tag updates and possibly promoting things to top level tags, so i think i agree existing item subtags are useless

12:05 PM

if we were going on another round of javascript work to improve headers, you probably want three things: (1) specific equipabble items, whether unique or specific named instances of a particular thing (e.g., Crown of Purity, Ewer of Liquid (Cleenseau), Apollyon's Crystal Ball, Eudomes' Enchiridon of the Occulta Ludum) (2) generic "things that exist in the game", which might be: books (A Fool's Fortune), materials (adamantine), generic kinds of magic or mundane items (Urskan Dragonhide Armor). (3) vehicles



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 12:03 PM EST

So I guess, maybe kill item subtags for now as well?

12:02 PM

for me specifically, I am trying to move away from D&D Beyond for various reasons in my game, and was going to use item/equipment to find mechanics to cleanup/port into obsidian. But on typing that out, it is much more obviously just a status/cleanup/mechanics



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 12:00 PM EST

hmm. actually now kind of wondering what we are going to use those subtags for, exactly



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 11:59 AM EST

but maybe just having item/specific item/kind item/equipment item/other is sufficient? and items would generally have 2 tags

11:59 AM

re: specific instance vs kind and "equp vs not" - I don't love having multiple subtags - although maybe that is fine? so I was leaning in on "equp vs not" as more useful

11:58 AM

re: vehicles - fair, probably something that could reasoonably have a different top level; that said, there is javascript work for getting headers right for a new top-level that might not be worthwhile



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 11:57 AM EST

i'm not convinced vehicles should be "items"

11:57 AM

agree items probably do want subtags. might need to think a bit on what. "specific instance" vs "kind" is useful, as is "equipment vs not"

11:55 AM

re: subtypes: agree organization subtypes are useless; i will mass delete and change to typeOf if missing -



**Deciusmus**

01/15/2025 at 11:34 AM EST

there could be an item/artifacts as well for legendary stuff that is in-theory equipment but isn't really viableto make up mechanics for but not sure if that is worthwhile

11:34 AM

with the idea that "equipment" is pages for either a class ("drankorian sending stones") or a specific item ("Ewer of Liquid (Cleenseau)") that would make sense as PC equipment. vehicle is boats, skyships, barges, wagons, caravans, whatever material is substances and other raw materials ("coinage" might fit here) other is everything else

11:32 AM

So maybe we want item/equipment item/vehicle item/material item/other

11:30 AM

although actually I think the implication of subtags is probably that everything should have one

11:29 AM

Naming is hard, but maybe something like item/equipment or item/equippable (for magical and mundane items for which playable stats would be sensible to make up)

11:27 AM

Question 1: Subtags are good for searching but are a bit of a pain to parse compared to typeOf/subTypeOf/etc for header generation. Arguably a subtag and a typeOf or subType really serve the same purpose but we seem to have settled on custom frontmatter and it doesn't seem worth chaning. For me, I think I'd bulk delete organization subtags as looking at them I don't see the value. For items, I think there is value in having a subtag specifically for "mechanics" items, i.e. anything a player might get and where mechanics might make sense for it. I actually don't think the magical vs mundane distinction is useful. A distinction for "specific instance" vs "kind" might be useful as well, in the subtags. But otherwise, I think the list we have is not that useful



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 10:20 AM EST

(2) we have likely way too many things tagged with status, especially status/needswork, since at one point (before dm frontmatter existed) we used status/needswork to indicate a page was incomplete, not wrong. Question 3: any opinions on the best way to quickly clean this up, especially for notes you wrote? I can just tag a bunch of stuff status/check/mike, perhaps easiest, but open to other ideas. probably going to blast through a lot of this this afternoon Question 4: do we need a status tag for "work in progress" that indicates a page is more complete than a stub but not "finished"? My inclincation is no, but open to ideas. Potentially this might be status/cleanup/wip, not status/needswork/wip. My general feeling is status/needwork and status/check (page is wrong, not canon) should be ideally kept small and be high priority to fix, while status/cleanup and status/metadata can be whatever.



**rsulfuratus**

01/15/2025 at 10:14 AM EST

(1) our current descriptive tag system feels pretty good, except: - subtags still linger in some places. for items and organizations they are used inconsistently and incompletely. for religions and pcs they are mostly/entirely complete. - we have both event and event-source and it isn't obvious what distinguishes them Question 1: is there any point in cleaning up subtags? it is quite easy to just delete a bunch. in most cases subtags have been superceded by typeOf, ancestry, and various related frontmatter. Question 2: do you remember the distinction between event and event-source?

10:09 AM

a few questions incoming

10:09 AM

this is a slow week at work (all the students are mostly still on winter break), i'm pretty motivated to try to do a big cleanup to get our tagging system to accurately reflect the state of taelgarverse and clean up a few lingering tag conflicts



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 7:26 PM EST

I think: 'status/cleanup/internal' is the most useful status tag for this (Alesh): %% needs work: lots of information about chronology, travels, and party contact scattered throughout session notes, that needs to be incorporated and cleaned up %%



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 6:56 PM EST

i just want status/needswork to be cleanly the pages with bad/misleading information only

6:55 PM

this is a bit of a change from how we've treated status/stub before, which was "needs a header" so we could have a status/wip or something to distinguish true stubs from "not enough information for author to consider finished"

6:52 PM

basically my goal is: - status/update, status/stub = page is incomplete, either because it was never finished or because events have proceeded - status/cleanup = someone wants to rewrite or thinks the page needs a rewrite - status/metadata = header, image, etc work - status/check = review, not rewrite with trying to keep status/needswork to a handful of pages that really need work because they are misleading. ideally there would be nothing in status/needswork



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 6:49 PM EST

Good point

6:49 PM

Ah fair



[**Deciusmus**](#1328870697610641530)On Alaric wanted to have at least a sentence or two about him before marking as complete



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 6:47 PM EST

so in that case I think the correct status tag is status/stub? which means "incomplete" for any definition of incomplete. my aim is to have status/needswork exclusively refer to pages where there is something wrong or non-canon about the text itself

On Alaric wanted to have at least a sentence or two about him before marking as complete



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 6:23 PM EST

I would go back to the basic idea, which is that we are not trying to use status tags to capture all the work we COULD do, just the state of the page.

6:21 PM

I think the incorporeal god page is probably reasonable as status/check/mike status/check/tim as the bare text not in %% is actually fine and introduces no need for decisions about canon.

6:20 PM

so the current kestavo page is probably something else

6:20 PM

but also I agree that status/check should not be used on pages where the ask is to read it and rewrite sections; it means the common action is to remove status/check only

6:19 PM

for (b) if I took 30 minutes to go over the kestavo doc and move to %% the non-core bits and delete some old stuff, I might want to leave status/check/mike to remind myself to revisit after I had let it sit for a day

6:19 PM

A few comments: (a) something like status/needswork/decision or status/needswork/shared seems to correctly indicate the idea that there is some actual work to decide on what is canon. (b) I like using status/check/mike, status/check/tim to indicate a page that appears in good shape but where someone wants to come back and review it as well as have the other one review.



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 5:30 PM EST

here is another one: # Incorporeal Gods %% tagging status/tim, status/mike as there are some decisions that probably should be made about the metaphysics of different types of gods. might need a better tag for "unclear cannon that needs to be decided" %% think we might need a different status tag for this, maybe status/needswork/shared?



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 5:08 PM EST

**rsulfuratus**

whereas candrosa is in 13 session notes but only has one sentence of (public) text



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 5:07 PM EST

Kiya has actually been writing session notes for each game, which is nice but I haven't been good about pulling them into obsidian and backlinking them



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 5:07 PM EST

things like rivers and small villages tend to get lots of cross links but don't show up in many session notes



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 5:07 PM EST

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 5:07 PM EST

right, since you don't have transcripts and session notes in the same way it is harder for the sembara game. things that have lots of backlinks to session notes are what i was thinking.



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 5:06 PM EST

There are probably a lot of places in Sembara with high backlinks, low text as I invented a lot of names and tend to make people from those places, but don't actually have any of the places themselves made up



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 5:04 PM EST

i think i'm now convinced our original approach was right after this brief discussion. we don't really need a tag for this kind of thing. i might do a little analysis out of curiosity, to e.g. find things that have tons of backlinks but very short pages (suggests places where i've done a bad job incorporating dm notes, perhaps), but from a tagging point of view it seems nicer to keep status tags and dm frontmatter clean



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 5:02 PM EST

I mean, a place where random invention is fine, subject to all the normal discussions and such

5:02 PM

I could kinda see the value of a "help wanted" type tag, for pages that seem empty compared to what they should be but where the implication is that it is a good source of random invention

5:01 PM

similarly, high comment to text ratio is stuff we are clearly interested in, but that no one has taken forward, probably because it isn't relevant to a game

5:01 PM

In particular, pages with low text to backlink but no status or dm tags suggests "open areas" of the world that would be valuable to make up, in some sense



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 5:00 PM EST

right, maybe not



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 5:00 PM EST

The question is... Do we need a way to identify "random actual worldbuilding unrelated to an ongoing game"

5:00 PM

I guess what I mean is... (a) we have a set of status/cleanup and related tags. This identifies pages that need fiddly cleanup. Useful as a "just go through and clean up" list, similar to say photo tagging or whatever. A sometimes fun way to waste 30 minutes between meetings or when you want to do something productive or whatever (b) dm_owner/dm_info which tracks stuff that has been made up or is active for a game, that isn't well captured in obsidian. that's stuff to write down for the purposes of running games mostly (c) status/needswork, status/stub and related - clear indicator that the page itself is not trustworthy, but its important enough that thing has been invented



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 5:00 PM EST

and the dm_notes / dm_owner does a great job of "page is correct, there is additional information"

4:59 PM

(in some cases it is just e.g. header information which isn't usually a big deal)

4:59 PM

i don't like a tag for this because i like having status tags be a clear indication of "there is something about this page you shouldn't trust"

4:58 PM

but maybe it doesn't really matter

4:57 PM

to identify pages that either have lots of brainstorming to work on, or pages that are underdescribed for their importance



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 4:57 PM EST

But why?



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 4:57 PM EST

what we really need is something like a script that identifies notes with either very high comment to real text ratios, or low text to backlink ratios



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 4:55 PM EST

I'm not sure that is totally right

4:55 PM

but I think we decided no status is better

4:55 PM

this type of thing was what I had originally created "blankslate" or whatever for



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 4:52 PM EST

what is the correct tagging for something like Yeraad River Basin? there is minimal canonical information but it is an obvious blank spot on the map with some brainstorming details. it doesn't feel like status/needswork is correct since we are trying to reserve that for notes that are incorrect in various ways. but it is not a stub either



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 4:27 PM EST

yeah



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 4:27 PM EST

I think PC pages should not show up on our "needs" work pages as they are instrictially somewhat stub-like

4:26 PM

I removed "player" from the DM_owner none list



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 4:09 PM EST

right, I guess that is the same as what I just said



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 4:09 PM EST

ideally those would be prioritized for whoever has color notes to incorporate. i believe the intention is that indicates "i have some notes but don't feel any ownership of this page"



**Deciusmus**

01/14/2025 at 4:09 PM EST

I used it a lot to mean: "I have no attachment or further plans for this person, but I haven't captured everything that came up in game around the person/place/etc"

4:08 PM

I'm looking at your Cleanup DM Info page and I wonder about dm_owner: none dm_notes: color

4:07 PM

nice...



**rsulfuratus**

01/14/2025 at 3:57 PM EST

finally got rid of all status/unknown tags



**rsulfuratus**

01/07/2025 at 10:28 PM EST

Actually Kate was kind of into playing a Light cleric since she likes all the sunlight type spells so she might actually be more into a new character than appears on the surface, would just be similar mechanically to Riswynn in some ways

10:27 PM

Anyway lots of good ideas imo

10:26 PM

Moon Druid could have a similar backstory I think



**Deciusmus**

01/07/2025 at 10:25 PM EST

Right. The background I had in mind was something from amber glow who had heard about cloudspinner somehow



**rsulfuratus**

01/07/2025 at 10:24 PM EST

But, it might be a fun character to tie to Isingue / cloud spinner / amber glow

10:23 PM

I like them all but I do think the fey wanderer ranger build specifically doesn’t get a lot from being high level particularly



**Deciusmus**

01/07/2025 at 10:22 PM EST

Moon druid and draconic sorcerer might be better high level options

10:22 PM

I was thinking a fey who was a fey wanderer using a shilleghah as a weapon seemed kinda fun. But that might also be a good low level character



**rsulfuratus**

01/07/2025 at 10:21 PM EST

Seeker makes everyone an effective face, more or less



**Deciusmus**

01/07/2025 at 10:20 PM EST

Not very inspired by paladin except that smite with Delwath is pretty fun. But I think I might save paladin for something else



**rsulfuratus**

01/07/2025 at 10:20 PM EST

It might be premature until seeing what happens at the discussion next week but from a worldbuilding point of view high level moon or dragon characters seem the most interesting to me



**Deciusmus**

01/07/2025 at 10:19 PM EST

I was leaning away from moon druid due to lack of cha but maybe you are right that doesn’t really matter

10:17 PM

Sorcerer seems the most fun from a mechanics perspective but I don’t have a great idea for world background. Also I felt like losing a front line fighter type might be less ideal (ie going with sorcerer)

10:15 PM

So of my 4 ideas (draconic sorcerer, moon druid, paladin of some kind, or fey wanderer ranger) the moon druid and fey wanderer were the most interesting to me



**rsulfuratus**

01/07/2025 at 10:11 PM EST

moon druid could be a good opportunity to develop the moon before your lunar sorcerer gets too high level

10:10 PM

actually moon druid could be a lot of fun too - honestly party doesn't really need a high charisma character, wellby at least is proficient in persuasion and intimidation so min roll is 15 already, plus inspiration



**rsulfuratus**

01/07/2025 at 9:57 PM EST

the new version of sorcerer looks really fun at high levels, one of the best level 20 features in the game

9:57 PM

but it does feel a little beryl-esque

9:57 PM

I've always liked the idea of the shillelagh ranger



**Deciusmus**

01/07/2025 at 9:22 PM EST

A ranger using a magic quarterstaff is probaly too Beryl-like, but its a little tempting. Fey wanderer ranger with drudic cantrips so just uses Shillelagh to fight in melee without a very good strength



**rsulfuratus**

01/07/2025 at 8:38 PM EST

as a side note - i am keeping in mind the idea of a level 20 mini-arc sometime in the future (not as part of this campaign, but maybe in a couple of years after we've started something new), after delwath or riswynn has done what they can with the crown, where you all get back together to destroy it once and for all. so there could be an opportunity to play level 20 delwath later on even if he is NPCized at the moment

8:35 PM

anyway this is a helpful perspective

8:35 PM

but also you can't solve all the problems in the world or it will be too safe and peaceful for the next campaign....

8:34 PM

i think this all makes sense and given this perspective and what kate and I discussed it might make the most sense to just throw it open to everyone next week. i am not really excited about running a "hunting down cultists of apollyon" arc either so if everyone feels you can't leave that thread hanging i would push for delwath taking the crown



**Deciusmus**

01/07/2025 at 5:04 PM EST

So I’d prefer either Riswynn or Delwath take it but could easily go one way or the other. I think given Kate isn’t excited about a new character and I am, I’d lean toward Delwath taking it, unless world-building or other people opinions pushed the other way

5:03 PM

I think my basic position is (A) it would be a little unsatisfying to just destroy the crown both from a world building and a in-game character perspective (B) I’d really have fun making up a new character that hooks into the next arc in some fashion (C) I’m a little torn about giving up Delwath

4:59 PM

Oh my other idea was a draconic sorcerer

4:59 PM

Druid kinda interesting but not a good balance for the party - another high charisma character makes more sense I think

4:58 PM

On (E) I was noodling around with… A circle of the moon Druid (probably human maybe stone born) A fey wanderer ranger (perhaps himself fey) A paladin of the sibyl/wildling/night queen or maybe the skar ocean god

4:55 PM

My basic thoughts are… (A) In-game, Delwath doesn’t want to see the crown destroyed. But he trusts Riswynn or himself to use it for good (B) from an abstract world building perspective Riswynn using it to expand the free orcs seems more interesting than Delwath using it to finish cleaning up the mess from Apollyon and bring back some degree of friendship between the elves and the humans (C) on the other hand; a revival of the Peronar via Delwath could be interesting world-building wise. (D) from a meta perspective hunting down cultists of apolloyon in the north doesn’t seem that fun as the next major arc ie compared to extra planar stuff. Delwath taking the crown to do that type of thing is an in-game out for why the rest of the party doesn’t do that (E) I like Delwath and would be happy to finish out the arc but also have several ideas for other characters that I’d be interested in playing (F) it does seem a little unsatisfying to NPCize Delwath rather than playing him out to level 20



**rsulfuratus**

01/06/2025 at 10:38 PM EST

anyway, no rush to reply as i'm sure you are busy with bar mitzvah stuff as well but would be good to get some thoughts before next tuesday

10:37 PM

(although that might steer too close to beryl-related things which you might want to avoid)

10:37 PM

a minor advantage of introducing a new character now to replace delwath might be using that character's backstory to better set up / add context to the isingue / plaguelands final arc that is intended to end the campaign

10:36 PM

but alternatively if delwath just wants someone to use it and the only quest everyone can agree on is 'free the orcs' kate is happy for riswynn to take that on

10:35 PM

so the upshot is, i think, that if you end up thinking about it some more and feel like you really want delwath's character arc to end with taking the crown, or if you are excited about a new character, you should take priority for claiming the crown

10:32 PM

kate and i talked for a while about Riswynn and the crown. basically she is happy for Riswynn to take the crown if it seems like it makes sense from either meta or in-game perspective (and I kind of like the worldbuilding implications of the free-more-orcs quest), and it would be a satisfying character arc for riswynn in a lot of ways - but as kate put it, riswynn cares a lot more about the orcs than kate does. and kate doesn't have a particularly strong desire to make a new character (she would probably just make a new cleric anyway).



**rsulfuratus**

01/03/2025 at 12:01 AM EST

i knew some of it - just make up the came from the riving



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 11:55 PM EST

Did you already know the source of the crown or did you just make this up? awesome either way



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 8:22 PM EST

sure



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 8:22 PM EST

I think you can wait until after Apollyon imo



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 8:21 PM EST

I kinda want to make sure everyone else is ok though... like to some extent need their cooperation to not stop delwath

8:21 PM

I'm really leaning towards this honestly.



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 8:20 PM EST

I wouldn't let "introduce a new character" stop you if you want to go this route with Delwath. this is the easiest possible point in a long campaign to introduce a new character, imo

8:19 PM

but I think it would be pretty easy no matter what. e.g., if everyone decides to go disrupt the Chardon chalyte trade, then Wazir could jsut level up a lot for example



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 8:18 PM EST

yeah



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 8:18 PM EST

Frankar would be a super easy arc to introduce a new character for



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 8:17 PM EST

right



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 8:17 PM EST

other than Frankar and the final Isingue arc, I don't have a lot of plans yet, so it is a bit up in the air. but from a metagame perspective it makes more sense to go straight to Frankar

8:16 PM

I am not sure - but my hope was to finish the Frankar arc before Eric's second kid is born, so that would potentially be the next arc



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 8:15 PM EST

I can't decide if it is unsatisfying to not end with the same character

8:15 PM

It is I guess possible you are not even sure

8:14 PM

So what is the next arc? Part of the question here is could I come up with a good Delwath alternative... I guess it shouldn't be that hard?



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 4:32 PM EST

I might sound out everyone else at the beginning of the session - don’t want to do it if Wellby or Kenzo would feel compelled to hunt Delwath down and take the crown back by force or something

4:31 PM

Yeah that makes sense



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 4:31 PM EST

e.g. if Chardon turned away from expansionist tendancies in the east, you could have peace with the Deno'qai of the Elderwood and reestablished ties with elves who might return to some of the forests north of the Elderwood

4:30 PM

there are a few possible strands here from a worldbuliding perspective. i am definitely expected some of the Cleansed to survive, either as an underground cult or the power behind a puppet/client state, worshipping a cult of Apollyon. i think the Chardonian Empire as designed is too big and makes the west feel a bit boring, so there is a good chance that there is some internal fragmentation. exactly how is unclear and tbd but, e.g., if Chardon turns against the chaltyte trade you could have Voltara in the north break away (rebelling against new Chalyte Control Laws) or something. i think if Delwath ran off with the crown, it would be very reasonable for success to look like a smaller Chardonian Empire, renewed peace with the elves and Dunmar, but likely still conflict in the north with the mercantilist oligarchs of voltara and the remnants of the cult of Apollyon



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 4:26 PM EST

Assuming the end of the campaign is freeing Isingue from the acid monster, that would setup the 1750s to be really quite peaceful and golden-ageish? It wouldn't be satisfying for Delwath to run off with the crown and then ultimately fail

4:25 PM

Does it make sense from a worldbuilding perspective to basically have Delwath succeeed at bringing peace, at least as far as Chardonioan Empire and its expansion and Dunmar is concerned? I think Delwath would see "peace" as a checked Chardonian Empire, satisfied with is territory, and not expansionist, and likely/perhaps a growing place of friendship with elves?

4:21 PM

but makes sense in retrospect

4:21 PM

yeah, that kinda got lost



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 4:20 PM EST

i think i was trying to manage too many things and was too subtle about delwath's death - it was supposed to be more clear that apollyon absolutely hates elves

4:19 PM

yeah, that could be good



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 4:19 PM EST

sorta pernonar esque

4:19 PM

less "my companions" and more "all people"

4:18 PM

I could even play in his death, actually (which to be honest was a little bit unsatisfying, it might have played better in reaction to something, it felt a bit anticlimatic... but anyway)... I could imagine Delwath coming back from the dead with a new perspective - a broader one



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 4:16 PM EST

if you want to go for that after the apollyon fight, from a meta perspective it would totally work and it would be easy to work in a new character in the gap between tonight and the next arc



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 4:15 PM EST

But the idea of delwath the peacemaker running off with the crown is a little bit appealing

4:14 PM

But that doesn't work for me



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 4:14 PM EST

yeah



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 4:14 PM EST

in the sense of power corrupts, not in the sense of the crown itself corrupts

4:14 PM

But of course he has a lot of pain in his backstory - if I wanted (which I don't) - his arc to be one of fall from grace the crown would be the kind of artifact that might encourage that...

4:13 PM

Right, I know



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 4:13 PM EST

the idea behind the crown is supposed to be pretty clear that it doesn't force you to become a villain. it is dangerous - very dangerous in the wrong hands - but it would not force delwath to become evil



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 4:12 PM EST

I could totally see him taking the crown and saying goodbye to the party in some fashion. Conceptually if he wanted to become a villian, he could pretty easily, it would be very hard for the party to find him if he plane shifted somewhere immediately after grabbing the crown. But I definitely don't want Delwath to end up a villian (although hunting him down and ending the scourge of the crown would be a cool arc)

4:10 PM

But it would be very in character for him, I think, to want to bring peace and a final end to the Great War

4:09 PM

So I am really unsure, and obviously I like Delwath, and also don't want to disrupt the party or have Delwath become a villian that Wellby or anyone else feels compelled to hunt down



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 4:08 PM EST

potentially there would be a time skip after the final battle tonight so there could be plenty of options for new characters, changing things up, etc



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 4:08 PM EST

yeah its really cool



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 4:08 PM EST

i am very happy with the crown as an artifact



**Deciusmus**

01/02/2025 at 4:07 PM EST

or at least, some wars

4:07 PM

But he was really interested in the idea that the crown could end wars

4:07 PM

It would obviously get complex and maybe require making a new 17th level character....

4:06 PM

I was considering having Delwath make a play to take and keep the crown as a way of bringing peace and an end to war

4:06 PM

from a pure worldbuilding perspective, and the idea of some kind of canonical 1750s Taelgar, I care a bit although I've always considered myself more of an observer on everything west of the Sentinals

4:05 PM

from my game perspective, doesn't matter. Even with some time skips my game will never get to the 1740s and also I have no real plans to ever have the game in Chardon or Dunmar.



**rsulfuratus**

01/02/2025 at 3:40 PM EST

working out some possible endings for the whole Dunmar/Chardon war, Kenzo's attempts to provoke unrest in the chalyte trade, and the rump part of the Cleansed. while some things are up in the air based on what your party does, especially w/r/t the Crown, some things are probably in motion already and could potentially result in major upheavals to the political landscape of Dunmar and the Chardonian Empire. curious how much you care about the outcomes here. this is obviously significantly later than your campaign, and far away, so might never matter.



**Deciusmus**

11/19/2024 at 11:08 PM EST

Specifically I was thinking that his lunar magic would help/be key in figuring out the basic plot of “needs some part of Ethlenn’s magic to keep portal open”



**Deciusmus**

11/19/2024 at 10:55 PM EST

yeah that is why I was thinking about it



**rsulfuratus**

11/19/2024 at 10:51 PM EST

but e.g. there could be an interesting lore connection with your lunar sorcerer, for example

10:50 PM

but also I think this is very vague - just a sense of there being a kind of tide-like phenonmenon, which is mysterious, but can potentially be controlling various ways and influenced by various powers

10:49 PM

re: tides - I think conceptually yes to both some kind of "tide" from Aldanor's realm and some vague metaphysical relationship between the moon's planar tides and Ethlenn's



**Deciusmus**

11/19/2024 at 10:48 PM EST

Right, that makes sense



[**Deciusmus**](#1308571212795875431)In general I like that. One thought is is there 1 domain or 2? do the various elder races typically have a single divine realm?



**rsulfuratus**

11/19/2024 at 10:48 PM EST

I think so far I've tended to think of a single divine realm for the each set of Firstborn / Embodied Gods. E.g, dwarves have just the Heart of the Mountain for all the Baharzel.



**Deciusmus**

11/19/2024 at 7:06 PM EST

Not suggesting that Ethlenn is anyway related to the moon, but rather than there is some commonality in the metaphysics

7:06 PM

?

7:06 PM

Would it make sense for Ethlenns ability to pull taelgar and the Feywild closer together and strengthen/make portals to be in some way metaphysically similar to the moon’s planar tides



**Deciusmus**

11/19/2024 at 6:16 PM EST

Also I wonder if there should be some type of sense of connection to the mela / leya connection. Is there a tide or sense in Aldanor's realm of the mela/leya? Does it originate there somehow?

6:14 PM

In general I like that. One thought is is there 1 domain or 2? do the various elder races typically have a single divine realm?



**rsulfuratus**

11/19/2024 at 10:49 AM EST

The plane is permeated deeply by a sense of age and ancientness -- there are no new growths, no saplings, no green shoots or new plants. Even the blooming flowers, mosses, vines and other small plants are permeated with a sense of age. There are exceptions though: the first is the stars - they often appear bright-new as if they were created moments ago. These stars often appear as if they are just within arms reach, although rarely does one who reaches for them find they really are within arms reach. It is said that the stars are the thoughts of Elmerca, and each continues a true foretelling of some future event. But it is also said that they are dangerous, and burn with a fierce cold and razor-sharp edges. The other exception is magic: out of the ancient trees magical creations regularly 'bloom'. This magic usually upsets the normal order of time: ephemeral things in the material plane are long-lived, and permanent things ephemeral: sparkling fireworks that last for days, or years; small wisps of energy shaped like squirrels, or birds, that dash across the woods and vanish into a tree the next moment; embodied notes of songs, that drift through the realm with a soft hint of music, and gather in flocks where the soft hints crescendo into orchestral triumphs; silver-flecked granite boulders, that last just long enough to serve as a stepping stone over a stream, and then scattering into a flurry of glittering silver; salty raindrops, like tears, the slowly drift down (or up) from the sky carrying pervasive sense of melancholy.

10:48 AM

Navigation is a challenge, as the place is partly memory and dream, and so navigation is not really by sight or touch, but by memory and recollection. Some pathways are lit up with magical beacons, and those with eyes to see the magic and the right memories can navigate more easily, although only between some of the major landmarks: the Cascade of Living Stars, the Wind Scar, the First Wilds, the Canopy of the Eldest, others unnamable and unreported. [No specific ideas on what these places are, just tossing out names]

10:48 AM

The domain of Aldanor and Elmerca is at first glance, an ancient forest at twilight, with bright stars twinkling above and secluded pools of still water reflecting the sky. But all is not as it seems. The forest is not a traditional forest, where the trees grow straight up from the ground, and where water flows downhill, and where the sky is always above. Instead, it is more a set of forest vignettes, connected by pathways of thought, dream, and magic. A visitor might arrive in a small glade, with ancient trees towering overhead and silver flowers blooming in the moonlight on the forest floor. But walking out of the glade, they might find themselves standing on criss-crossed branches hundreds of feet across, part of the canopy of an unimaginably large tree, looking down at a river of bright stars sparkling like a field of diamonds. Walking around a branch, the visitor might find it narrowing, and narrowing, until they find themselves in the leaves of an ancient oak grove, surrounded by cliffs that go up forever, but growing out of nothing but a field of stars below. Climbing to the base of one of the oaks, the visitor might notice the field of stars becomes, as they pass the edge of the grove, swaying bridge of twisted vines and moss and delicate orchids with hundreds of complex petals, leading over a gorge between two huge cliffs, with a misty bottom a thousand feet below, and trees growing up out of the bottom of the gorge and stretching into the sky full of stars.

10:48 AM

oh, wait, found this email

10:48 AM

do you have any ideas about what the divine realm of Aldanor might be like? i thought we had some brief discussions about this at some point but can't find them now

I did test that a culture page wins over an alias for a ancestry tag. So if we say added a "Sembaran" culture page all the humans with ancestry: Sembaran would (if the header was regenerated) link to the Sembaran culture page rather than the Sembara geopolitical page

12:08 PM

I'm going to push a change that does 2 things: (a) makes "culture" a new page type, so that a tag of "culture" doesn't cause an unknown page (b) special cases whereabouts for culture to not be dynamic. I think the use case is very low there and it looks funny to have 2 lines. (c) makes the default display line for culture be: boxInfo: " <(based in )whereabouts>" The website version should work but I haven't tested it much.

10:16 AM

that seems sensible



**rsulfuratus**

11/01/2024 at 10:15 AM EDT

i don't really have time to undertake a major reorg today so what I might do for now is (a) use "culture" instead of "organization" as the top-level tag where it makes more sense, and (b) make a cultures subdir in organizations to move culture-tagged notes to to prep for any later reorg

I think ancestry is a good way of thinking about it. Cultures are the pages that should link from a person or thing's "ancestry" tag

10:14 AM

and then we could add cultures either: (a) under Species (b) under Gazetteer at a top level (c) under Gazetteer nested in the geographic region where the culture mostly is (d) (a) for cultures that don't have a clear geographic fit, (c) for those that do (e) (b) for cultures that don't have a clear geographic fit, (c) for those that do



**rsulfuratus**

11/01/2024 at 10:13 AM EDT

for a culture I'd write in more in the style of the Dunmar page, albeit likely in less detail



**Deciusmus**

11/01/2024 at 10:12 AM EDT

Right... perhaps introducing a new "page type" of culture would make sense



**rsulfuratus**

11/01/2024 at 10:12 AM EDT

e.g. for a normal organization I'd typically clean up the page by adding a campaign None block with members, and writing the note to try to capture any information about the organizations goals, history, mission

10:12 AM

but in some ways I'm less worried about where they "go" and more about how to handle headers and writing style

10:10 AM

as opposed to e.g. the Hezguli, the group of orcs who became free orcs in adulthood, which is clearly an organization

10:09 AM

e.g. people of the rainbow is really the equivalent of "Sembaran" for orcs,

10:09 AM

i'm more concerned with things that are more like ancestries that don't work well with the type categorizations of "organization"



**Deciusmus**

11/01/2024 at 10:08 AM EDT

I can see how they are not necessarily a good fit for Organizations (which works better for smaller groups) but I'm not sure where to put them in Gazetteer



**rsulfuratus**

11/01/2024 at 10:08 AM EDT

I'm actually less concerned with things like the Oracle of the Riven, or the Society of the Open Scroll, which while they could easily fit in either gazeteer or organizations, are clearly organizations by any definition of the word



**Deciusmus**

11/01/2024 at 10:08 AM EDT

but the gazetteer is organized geographically, which makes something like the People of the Rainbow a weird fit



**rsulfuratus**

11/01/2024 at 10:07 AM EDT

(which would also be strictly culture / history pages)

10:07 AM

also in cleaning up the vargald note it is apparent we could use pages for things like the Zimka and the Northerners



**Deciusmus**

11/01/2024 at 10:07 AM EDT

(probably?)

10:06 AM

like where does "Oracle of the Riven" belong? Should it be in Gazetter under Tyrwingha?

10:06 AM

We've always had a bit of an organizational problem with "culture" type things.



**rsulfuratus**

11/01/2024 at 9:58 AM EDT

in particular it is a bit tricky to come up with a "type" for something like the Vargaldi note, beyond "culture". it is functionally more like the "Dunmar" page

9:58 AM

I have been just hitting "Get random note" and fixing things up when I have 5-10 minutes between meetings or tasks, and have hit a row of organizations lately that makes me want to slightly refactor "organizations". In particular, I'm not sure that notes that describe cultures (Deno'qai, Vargaldi, orc hordes, hobgoblin clans) necessarily make sense in organizations (as opposed to gazeteer). e.g. we have all the various pages on Dunmar/Sembara political organization, culture, society in realms



**Deciusmus**

10/31/2024 at 11:22 AM EDT

but i.e. setting dm tags on all the feywild realms is definitely worthwhile

11:22 AM

i.e. dm_owner on plane of fire but not plane of earth, which is (theoritcally) valueable info to me (although my campaign is no where close to the outer planes at the moment, obviously)

11:22 AM

yeah, you did



**rsulfuratus**

10/31/2024 at 11:21 AM EDT

i think i did set a few in cosomology when doing a bit of cleanup / reorg there



**Deciusmus**

10/31/2024 at 11:21 AM EDT

but i.e. cosmology I think its valuable

11:21 AM

and campaigns is excluded from a lot of MOC stuff

11:21 AM

or whatever

11:21 AM

campaigns is silly, as everything in the campaign folder is implicitly dm_notes: (owner of campaign)

11:20 AM

yeah



**rsulfuratus**

10/31/2024 at 11:20 AM EDT

right, we would presumably not bother for setting on pages in campaigns, but i can see for cosomology, events, history, etc it might be useful



**Deciusmus**

10/31/2024 at 11:20 AM EDT

there are exceptions, i.e. Duskmire

11:19 AM

It is probably a reasonable assumption that cosmology/religion/etc are none/none if unset (vs people/places/things where it is trickier to assume) but if I was in a completest/cleanup mode I'd set the none/nones on the other pages

11:19 AM

I think there are no so many pages outside people/places and I do think it is useful to be able to find pages without it set



**rsulfuratus**

10/31/2024 at 11:13 AM EDT

setting it makes it easier to find pages that should have it but don't, i guess

11:13 AM

I'm not super busy today and am getting back to some of the dm status stuff and obsidian cleanup, which has taken a back seat to session prep in my taelgar time for a while. is it useful to set dm_notes and dm_owner on pages outside people/places/things/groups? e.g., species, cosomology, religion, etc. most of these would be dm_notes: none, dm_owner: none, but there might be isolated exceptions and I have no particular opinion on whether it is better to have default info set for all pages or just assume blank = none/none

I spent a bunch of time playing with the new Midjourney image editor making a doppleganger Delwath token and then realizing of course the doppleganger doesn't have Delwath's gear. here is the best of the bunch if you want to use it as your token or modify from here: [https://cdn.midjourney.com/24710520-0572-42be-ac7a-2f0a86be5dbb/0_0.png](https://cdn.midjourney.com/24710520-0572-42be-ac7a-2f0a86be5dbb/0_0.png "https://cdn.midjourney.com/24710520-0572-42be-ac7a-2f0a86be5dbb/0_0.png")

I'm not sure how much of the Umbraeth / Ethlenn dynamic is really developed or canon, but clearly in the past ~700 years (since the fall of Amberglow), Umbraeth has been grabbing territory, getting more powerful, expanding his domain, and so it is possible that Serenveil is a window into how the kind of unconnected fey feel about this, which might be largely a sense of anger at Umbraeth not necessarily for his original offenses, but for being the one with the big stick on the block. and also potentially could involve some annoyance at Ethlenn for not properly dealing with the problem (which, in their eyes, she created in the first place). especially given that Ethlenn clearly has somewhat unusual motives for an archfey given the Tyrwingha connection, etc



**rsulfuratus**

10/16/2024 at 3:05 PM EDT

looked at the Serenveil stuff a bit, and was thinking a little more last night. I like the vibe of Istarias basically being a pawn (at least that is how it reads to me based on your notes), and I like Serenveil as an ally (of sorts, at least) of Ethlenn, but not a vassal. I don't yet have any good ideas for what Serenveil's motives are (open to suggestions; presumably the de Brune family cult is deeply involved in whatever this is, although perhaps they have other motivations as well). But I think the dynamic of Serenveil looking to Ethlenn for protection against a stronger bully (Umbraeth) is probably the right vibe and seems consistent with both campaigns so far.



**Deciusmus**

10/16/2024 at 12:03 PM EDT

I pushed a house rules rename and a bit of detail on Serenveil/de Brunes/the fey I made up from Serenveil's domain



**Deciusmus**

10/15/2024 at 2:54 PM EDT

in the website build side?

2:54 PM

? What if I renamed to House Rules (Tim) and House Rules (Mike) and then fixed in the TOC?



**Deciusmus**

10/15/2024 at 2:37 PM EDT

can I move yours to Dunmar Frontier or something? I guess you want to potentially use it for different campaigns

2:37 PM

your house rules file in Campaigns\Mechanics conflicts with my house rule file in Campaigns\Cleenseau\Mechanics\House Rules



**rsulfuratus**

10/15/2024 at 12:27 PM EDT

I pushed a Lord Serenveil page fyi



**Deciusmus**

10/15/2024 at 12:24 PM EDT

It was probably just a cut and paste error and I meant to have image; filename

12:24 PM

The note is wrong

12:24 PM

Nothing



**rsulfuratus**

10/15/2024 at 12:23 PM EDT

but as far as I can see most other notes just use image: filename.png so unclear what is being accomplished by using the markdown linking format in yaml

12:18 PM

changing it to: image: "![[simon-of-cranford.png]]" probably would also work

12:17 PM

so the python yaml module is trying to figure out how to generate a tag [[simon-of-cranford.png]] but can

12:16 PM

the problem is that ! is a reserved character in yaml

12:15 PM

I haven't published in a while either



**Deciusmus**

10/15/2024 at 12:14 PM EDT

but I'm not sure why that one note had a problem for me and not you

12:14 PM

removing image: ![[simon-of-cranford.png]] fixed it

12:13 PM

Simon of Cranford

**Deciusmus**

10/15/2024 at 11:53 AM EDT

11:53 AM

I haven't published my taelgarverse in a while, but am getting an error: raise ConstructorError(None, None, yaml.constructor.ConstructorError: could not determine a constructor for the tag '![[simon-of-cranford.png]]' in "", line 7, column 8: image: ![[simon-of-cranford.png]]
