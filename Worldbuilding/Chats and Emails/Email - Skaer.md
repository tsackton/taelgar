(July 2023)
I am thinking about the Skaer a little bit. 

  

What I know about them so far:

- They have a monotheistic religion, derived from the ancient mariner pantheon, but with the ocean goddess, Kaikkea, the only remaining deity. Worship is centered on the church, which is also typically a big part of the local community, with the priest a significant figure in each local village or town

- They settled in the far western corner of the Green Sea in part because they were fleeing(?) / avoiding(?) / wanted no part in (?) the schism among the eastern mariners that produced the divine spark religion and possibly whatever the MTP people end up with

- The Skaer Islands are volcanic, difficult to navigate, and stormy, and fairly far north, but also have some geographic similarities with the Greek islands (lots of little islands in close proximity).

- They once had a larger empire, stretching along the coast of Vostok and probably Cymea, perhaps even past Tollen to Telham or similar, but were defeated by the Drankorians and forced back, and since they have waxed and waned in reach but never come close to that extent (so their "glory days" would be something like 1000 years in the past, or a bit more)

- They are skilled smiths and sailors, known for Skaer steel, fisheries, and navigation/reading the weather skill

- Historically they have been coastal raiders, but this is likely not a major part of their economy / culture post-Great War

- They are very religious, and fairly isolationist in the current day  

  

Things I'm not sure about:

- How are they governed and organized politically? Does not feel like they are particularly likely to be feudal, at least not with a hereditary nobility; at the same time I'm not sure some kind of oligarchy / republic is a great fit either. Theocracy is a possibility but would want a way to distinguish it from the Dunmari version, where temple administrator = mayor. 

- What is the typical village / town like? Obviously very based on the sea, but also there would often be valuable raw materials inland, and there is the concern about volcanic activity. Plus they would generally need to import at least some food in many circumstances; I am not sure what their diet or food culture would be like, beyond probably having a lot of pickled fish. 

- What is the hook that makes the religion unique / makes the religious practice stand out? Beyond monotheism, obviously. 

  

If you have any thoughts about history / culture / religion / politics, I'd be curious.

One thought right away…  
  
I’m sorta starting to think your idea of “loose pantheon” makes sense for MTP.  
  
My broad idea would be that as the easterners moved through the Green Sea, as you suggest below, there is a religious schism of some sort and when it settles there are 3 strands of easterner religion:  
  
- the “old pantheon” of which only Kaikkea survives (but see MTP below)  
- a “divine spark” religion, with a strong tradition of gurus, surviving today  ???  but probably Irrla  
- a dualistic religion with a strong “good” and “evil” god where the good god is associated with the unified Arha/Malik where the avatars of the “good” god are seen as the main hands of the divine overlord (and are potentially pretty vague)  
  
[ Alternatively maybe that dualistic religion developed in Medju or similar south/east mixed places as the eastern “divine spark” and primacy of the divine presence mixed with unique but undefined southern traditions ]  
  
MTP then picks up on all these strands, plus a bit of Mos Numera and maybe even the Dunmari Siblings, plus a few random deities with no meaningful connection to anywhere else and maybe one or two old gods who survived from the ancient mariner pantheon but have changed and are somewhat unrecognizable.  
  
This is I guess only loosely related to Skaer and probably should be on the other email thread.  
  
A few other thoughts more about Skaer:  
  
- the history in the Tollen obsidian note gives them a slightly more expanded range along the coast of Sembara even than Telham, which seems fine  
- Cymea is missing from a lot of the Tollen doc. I’m imagining that before Drankor Cymea was very much part of Skaer and was settled by the same people (maybe more on the islands than the peninsula). Drankor conquerors this part Skaer first and establishes the province of Cymea; this cuts off part of the Skaer empire  
- politically / religiously— what about a very communal society? More on this below.  
  
Skaer Society  
  
The Skaer believe that as the ocean Kaikkea is the source of all life, she owns all the land of their islands, and they are just borrowing it from her. Skaer society is thus very communal and there is a strong ethos that the Skaer have been given talents and skills by Kaikkea and thus owe the fruits of their labors back to her, mostly in the form of providing for her people, the Skaer. And thus the basic idea of “from each according to their skill, to each according to their need” is very embedded in their way of life.  
  
They mostly wish to be left alone these days and protect Kaikkea — I imagine a sense of loss over the oceans and lands Kaikkea is not free to walk (although I also imagine that historically Skaer religion was not nearly so communistic and this likely developed after the fall of their empire).  
  
They forge steel - the source of which is of course Kaikkea — to honor her, and trade her steel away, when necessary, for things they don’t need but part of why Skaer steel is so sought after is that in fact they don’t trade much of it. The volcanic soil is fertile, although the land to farm is small, so there is some grains, but more pasture for big wooly Icelandic sheep, and of course fish and fish and more fish. Timber is probably the most precious resource not provided by Kaikkea and a typical Skaer household might have a fine steel knife that would be the envy of a Sembaran lord but might lack beds, and the people sleep on sheepskin piles on the floor.  
  
The political organization is based around the honuha, roughly “work group” which is a mixed professional and familial unit that tends to manage a farm, or crew a boat, or manage a fishery together. These are primarily familial groups but people can and do move between them either by marriage (it would be taboo to marry within your honuha) or just by preference or happenstance. Maybe 40-80 people usually.  
  
The territory of Skaer is divided into ~100 mostly self-governing “districts” each with between 4 and 10 honuha within them.  
  
Each honuha is run on a very democratic basis and elects a ha’i’leo (roughy speaker), who along with the ha’i’lea for the other honuha in the district largely govern the district - decide who farmers and fishes where, manages the redistribution of goods as needed, etc. In addition to the ha’i’leo, who run the day to day of the district, each district has a ha’i’akkea (roughly speaker to god).  
  
The ha’i’akkea is not part of any honuha and is almost universally a divine magic user, which is more common in Skaer than elsewhere. This person mediates disputes and guides the district and ultimately has the power to exile and excommunicate anyone who is troublesome. Additionally the ha’i’akkea is responsible  for the ritual laws and respect of Kaikkea which is encoded in a large series of Hawaiian style taboos. Breaking taboos is punishable by fines, work tasks, exile, or death depending on the severity of the taboo.  
  
When disputes arise between districts, or the community needs to act as a whole, the ha’i’akkea meet in sacred council to determine the will of Kaikkea. Should difficulties arise in this process, the twelve “elders” resolve them.  
  
(Left unclear - where do the priests come from?)  
  
That’s a big half formed but seemed interesting.  
  
Thoughts? I’m going for a blend of Hawaii culture with Kaikkea standing in for the kings, but a bit of pure 19th/20th century communism, plus some Quaker/Shaker religious stuff.

I like this and I think the basic idea works. The dualistic religion feels like it could fit well in Medju, actually. Or it could be the “old” religion of Ursk which has been largely driven underground. Lots of possibilities - and means MTP can be a place to just drop cool ideas for deities that don’t fit elsewhere.

Yes, this makes sense. Earlier we had worked out an expansion route that has Drankor spread north along the Green Sea coast first (east of the giant forest of which Orenlas is only surviving remnant), which means they reach Cymea before Mostreve Hills. If the Skaer never settled too far inland, this land could be relatively empty in the years after the Downfall Wars — or inhabited by hobgoblins / orcs / whatever. So the Skaer don’t leave much of a cultural footprint.

What if there have always been kind of two strands of Skaer religious thought: a more expansive one that sees the Skaer as the rightful protectors of all the oceans (this might be kind of similar to original Hkar mariner belief), and a more isolationist/communal one that is more anti-hierarchy and anti-imperial. 

  

Early on it was the communal Skaer that fled the schism and founded Tollen, etc. After the downfall the expansionist strain took control and you have the Skaer empire, until it is defeated by Drankor. Perhaps this was a decisive defeat and the expansionist branch is dead, or perhaps there have been waves back and forth. 

  

Maybe even Kailkkea actively manipulates the culture to push in an expansionist direction when needed and a communal direction when needed.

The Vostok coast is rich in timber, and controlled in parts by the Skaer, but otherwise this seems very good. Timber perhaps is too precious for shipbuilding to “waste” on furniture.

I like this a lot - I think it works perfectly. 

  

Perhaps one implication is the Skaer don’t really have market towns and cities. Places with good, safe harbors might have more dense settlement, and you might have some small cities associated with particularly important religious sites or significant mineral resources. But most Skaer settlements would be 3-5 communal groups - and because of the frequent volcanic activity it wouldn’t be too surprising for your town to get destroyed, meaning there aren’t a ton of really old cities in the heart of Skaerhem: the oldest Skaer cities are probably actually on the south Vostok coast or on the coast west of Ursk.

I like the Skaer having much more divine magic than almost anyone else. Perhaps Kaikkea is basically the oldest human god still worshipped and has some special power because of that. 

  

As for where priests come from: maybe there is some kind of ritual test? An existing priest detects some divine spark and if you are willing you sail off and face some kind of challenge. If you make it back, you’ve either unlocked the divine spark and become a priest, or not and don’t. 

  

Wouldn’t necessarily have to mean access to divine magic. Maybe you have some holy warrior types or just charismatic leaders who pass as well - the details probably don’t matter too much. 

  

Also perhaps this means that Skaer society is kind of conformist - it is hard to be an iconoclast is a society like this. This might lead to a non-trivial Skaer presence in Tollen and along the Vostok coast, perhaps even in Cymea or serving on Tollender ships  (or even halfling ships). A lot of these people might not have been formally exiled, but left because they might have been exiled otherwise. 

  

Or, perhaps there is even something like the Amish rumspringa type wander year.

It feels like it fits quite well. I wanted to come up with something that wasn’t just Taelgar Vikings and I think this feels pretty distinct and interesting.

This seems like an interesting idea to riff on. One thought: during the Drankorian expansion Skaer wasn’t defeated in some great naval battle or anything. Instead the Skaerem on Cymea were quickly conquered, but instead of fighting back (which Kaikkea could see would be doomed) the culture retreated and there was a homecoming back to Skaer and the near shores of Ursk/Vostok. 

  

Not sure how this plays with the history of Tollen but it could be a reason why Skaer doesn’t maintain a large naval presence. Drankor never defeats them they just choose to retrench instead of fight. And gives an opening for the first phase of Tollender maritime power. 

  

There’s an open question of what happens when Drankor collapses, but lots of reasons why this would generate a second Skaer empire. Maybe this is a period where the expansionists gain significant influence but Cymea is a strong competitor to Skaer and instead of achieving and empire the Skaer mostly raid in the western gulf. This is a foundational time in Sembaran history and legends of Skaer raiders become embedded in the Sembaran psyche. So even though the Skaer are today very much not raiders or pirates in large parts of Sembara and Tyrwingha there is this kind of historical prejudice against them as raiders from the great legends of the founding days of Sembara. 

  

When the Great War comes Kaikkea again pushes against expansion- either because the 2nd empire failed or for her own inscrutable reasons. So a resurgent Tollen emerges as the only real naval power in the western gulf as the collapse of Isingue saps the economy of Cymea.

 > >  The Vostok coast is rich in timber, and controlled in parts by the Skaer, but otherwise this seems very good. Timber perhaps is too precious for shipbuilding to “waste” on furniture. 

I forgot about the fact that they control the Vostok coast. Maybe timber isn’t rare. But also it would be plausible that there is basically no wood on the Skaer islands themselves and that in fact most of the timber shipped from the northern coasts is used for docks, shipbuilding, etc and both charcoal and wooden furniture and wood for fires are rare, leading to smoky peat and sheep dung fires and perhaps some relatively cold winters. 

  

> Perhaps one implication is the Skaer don’t really have market towns and cities.

  

Yeah I like this. 

  

> Places with good, safe harbors might have more dense settlement, and you might have some small cities associated with particularly important religious sites or significant mineral resources.

  

Or places well positioned to use geothermal heat — hot springs and the like. 

> But most Skaer settlements would be 3-5 communal groups - and because of the frequent volcanic activity it wouldn’t be too surprising for your town to get destroyed, meaning there aren’t a ton of really old cities in the heart of Skaerhem: the oldest Skaer cities are probably actually on the south Vostok coast or on the coast west of Ursk. 

This is great and another practical reason for the communistic trend - it’s a form of insurance. Especially if a lot of the volcano eruptions are slow lava flows, they might not cause massive loss of life - but nothing much is going to stop the lava flow coming to destroy your small community, so you get out and the other honuha in the district help you rebuild. 

  

  

> > As for where priests come from: maybe there is some kind of ritual test?

  

That works- although I think it also works to leave it a bit of a blank spot. 

> Or, perhaps there is even something like the Amish rumspringa type wander year. 
>

This seems really cool. You could imagine a tradition of wandering for a year or two or three, and that provides a natural point to switch honuha. If you come back from the rumspringa which a keen eye for smithing, but your familial honuha are fisherfolk, it is natural to move at that point. 

It also provides an escape valve — as you mention before, there is a certain amount of conformity in Skaer culture. And people who don’t fit very well are effectively allowed to never return from their wandering. Unlike being excommunicated this is probably not a punishment or a situation where you are shunned, these Skaer expat communities could have close ties back to the homeland and some cases the children of these expats might sometimes “get religion” and return home. 

Skaer culture is probably much rougher on those who are not self-aware enough during their wandering year to know not to return home, and who end up being pushed out by the priests/community. These exiles are probably more often excommunicated/shunned.
