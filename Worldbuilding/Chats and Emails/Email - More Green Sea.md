So sketching out some more stuff that I might try to capture in Obsidian...


I actually wonder if the Green Sea isn't really four distinct regions, rather than 3...

- The Western Gulf, as discussed frequently
- The Western Green Sea, broadly the region bounded by the Straight of Cymean in the west, Skaer and Ursk in the north, Irrla in the east, and Lorighos (proposed name or the South Cymean large island) in the south
- The Gulf of Arazeja (proposed name for the body of water between the <Maritime Trade Peninsula> (henceforth <MTP>), South Cymea, and Irrla)
- The Eastern Green Sea, broadly the region stretching from <MTP>, Irrla, and eastern Ursk in the east to <MagicIsles> and all the way north to <FarNorthPeninsula> (henceforth <FNP>)

Perhaps the name "Green Sea" is really a Sembaran/Tollen/Drankorian word that primarily applies to what I label "Western Green Sea" above, and there is some other name for the eastern part. People in Tollen could talk about ships coming from "beyond The Green Sea" which might be more evocative. But that could be too big of a retcon/name change, although I don't recall the name of the ocean coming up in the one-shot out east.

  

So with the above, you'd have rumors and some firm knowledge of both the Western Green Sea and the Gulf of Arazeja in Tollen, but the Eastern Green Sea is much more mysterious. Out east, there is who-knows-what amongst the <MagicIsles>, and also amongst the <FarEast>. Medju is obviously canonical from the one-shot, but perhaps in Tollen there is no really clear sense of anything out east of the Gulf of Arazeja/Ursk.

  

In this world, the major maritime powers are, perhaps:

- Tollen, who dominates the Western Gulf, and trades extensively along the near part of the Western Green Sea, and the Gulf of Arazeja, with occasional forays as far east as Ursk and perhaps parts of Irrla, but who rarely cross the Gulf of Arazeja and who never go east of Irrla.
- <MTP>, who criss-cross the Gulf of Arazeja (and are likely the dominant maritime power in the region) and who sail along the southern coast as far east as the <MagicIsles>, but who rarely sail north, and who are  more of a sailing culture than a merchantile one, and therefore perhaps often crew the ships of Medju and other southern powers
- <SomeMagicIsleCivilization>, mumble, mumble, the northern and <MagicIsles> green sea is pretty vague
- Halflings, who mostly sail a number of routes -- the big ones being a loop from Ursk-><MagicIsle>->Desert-><MTP>->Irrla, a north-south route along the <MagicIsles>, and a western loop from <MTP>->Cymea->Tollen (winter)->Ursk->Irrla-><MTP> (these are just random ideas, different ideas can be sketched out)

The main idea of the above is to segregate somewhat the "near Green Sea", which would include Ursk, parts of Irrla, <MTP>, Eastern Dunmari, Cymea, South Cymea, Vostok and Skagenland from the "far Green Sea", which is everything east of Ursk/Irrla/<MTP>, and to have exotic goods from the "far east" come via a multi-stage route: from far away lands to <MTP> (via MTP or halfling or <SomeMagicIsle> or Irrla or whatever ships), then from <MTP> to Lorighos and other ports in South Cymea (via halfling or MTP ships), and then from Lorighos and South Cymea onward to Tollen (mostly via Tollen ships). There would additionally be a second route from <MTP> to Tollen, and very rarely a halfling vessel making a complete circuit and bringing unbelievable tales of whatever is way out east. 

  

In places like Tollen, Telham, Tyrwingha, and Embry (but especially Tollen) places like <MTP>, Irrla, and Ursk would be known, but the places way far east would be much more fanciful rumors. 

  

This suggests that making up a rough sketch of <MTP> and Eastern Dunmari are perhaps more impactful to Tollen and other places west than whatever is way out west, and provides a somewhat useful way of dividing up the map.

  

That suggests tossing around some ideas for <MTP> (and some proper names) as well as a clearer sense of the difference between Cymea and South Cymea, and what's on the western coast of Irrla would all be fruitful.

  

Some brainstorms later.

  

What do you think?

===============

A few random thoughts — will reply in more depth when I have time tomorrow. I think this is a reasonable direction to go at first glance, though. 

  

1. I have this sense that the eastern mariner culture is kind of Polynesian in a sense. The Skaer retain some of this, and perhaps the culture of the MTP does also. Raises the question of what gods they should worship. 

  

2. Some part of the southern/ western coast should likely be the remnants of the vast lizardfolk empire that once stretched through much of the green sea. Perhaps south Cymea area.

  

3. Irrla could easily have 3-4 civs in addition to Republic of Svolhas and the hobgoblins. Could be a place for the neo-Eastern religion. Perhaps also something kind of pirate-y. Or something really strange like a city state ruled for 1000 years by an ancient gold dragon. Or a kingdom of giants.

Just one other thought—- in the older history of humanity doc we have there is fewer distinctions. The <MTP> are the eastern dunmari and then the people farther East are the “neo-East” folks or the “southern old Hkar” folks. 

  

Was it ever established what gods were worshiped in Medju or Irrla or Ursk? It feels like there still isn’t a place for the “meditation direct worship of Arha/Malik” — maybe somewhere in Irrla?

  

That would leave Skaer as the evolution of the old Hkaran mariner tradition and maybe the rest of the green sea is more religiously diverse. The neo-eastern philosophy could have left the people in a situation where new gods developed rapidly and so the eastern green sea now has a much more diverse set of religious traditions than the Drankor/late Hkar stability of the west. 

  

  

I kinda prefer the split I have people where <MTP> are clearly different from Eastern Dunmari, and also clearly not Drankorian influenced, and perhaps something of another odd-ball one-off like the Dummari. But the older docs do imply <MTP> is the same as Eastern Dunmari which could also work.

What if there were large salt marshes along the coast ranging from the mountains by <MTP> all the way into South Cymea where the remains of the lizard folk empire is?

  

Perhaps these lizard folk have boats and are a significant maritime power in the Gulf of Arazeja? They also isolate the East Dunmari from the coast although whether that is a good or a bad thing not sure…  but perhaps the East dunmari are have a uniquely (or at least a uncommonly close) relationship with the lizard folk and perhaps also some dwarves living in the East mountains (or stoneborn or both). The whole region could have a very non-human feel which would also be a reason why drankor didn’t expand and a buffer to make MTP culture not very Drankorian.

A few more notes. I have a busy day today but have a few 30 minute chunks between meetings and may try to organize something, but we'll see. 

  

1. On the Eastern Dunmari - they not a particularly ocean-going culture, and for various reasons should be located in the area just west of the mountains on the western edge of MTP, and perhaps slightly inland. I think they don't need to be developed much at the moment, since the main concern is trade routes and major maritime powers. These should not be the same people as the MTP mariners. 

  

2. I am kind of thinking the same with lizardfolk - I already have the salt lizardfolk in Mawar and would kind of like to keep that a Mawar thing. Although I could change my mind about this. I am thinking about the interior of MTP? We have this as a subtropical (Cwa / Cwb) climate similar to SE USA or SE Brazil, very appropriate for big swamps. The MTP mariner culture could be very strongly coastal. 

  

3. As far as religion, I am a little more uncertain. Ursk feels like a place that isn't particularly religious, but that probably doesn't mean there are no gods worshipped there (although perhaps they are suppressed), and also could mean it is a good place for the neo-Eastern religion. Irrla and Medju never had any kind of religion canonically determined in the Wellby one-shot; no one played divine magic users. This is all pretty open, although I wonder how much it needs to be decided now.
