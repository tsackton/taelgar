what do you think of this:

Civilizations and Cultures
See more: [[Sembara]], [[Tyrwingha]], [[Addermarch]], [[Tollen]], [[Vostok]], [[Zimkova]], [[Duchy of Maseau]]

This is a heavily peopled land. In the north, amongst the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], the [[Zimka]] people live a traditional life in the highlands of [[Zimkova]], and have formed three realms: [[Breva]], [[Lavnoch]], and [[Ardlas]]. South and east of the Zimkovan realms is [[Sembara]], a rich and powerful monarchy with a long history. Sembara is bordered to its south by the ancient fey-protected realm of [[Tyrwingha]], as well as the independent earldom of [[Addermarch]] and the [[Duchy of Maseau]], once under the suzeranity of Sembara, but now an independent land populated by refugees from the [[Isingue]] and the [[Plaguelands]]. To the east is the famous [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]] and past Tollen, the lightly populated coasts and forests of [[Vostok]].

There are two large and ancient lizardfolk settlements: [[Ozabal]], in the delta of the [[Wistel]], and [[Latazaro]], on the eastern borders of [[Tyrwingha]]. Beyond these settlements, lizardfolk are common along the river valleys. There are three major [[Dwarves|dwarven]] realms on the western borders, and dwarves are common in the human cities of Sembara, although there are no large, independent dwarven realms within Greater Sembara. Halflings are commonly seen plying their trade along the roads and rivers of the region, as well sailing across the [[Western Gulf]] and into the wider [[Green Sea]]. Although [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]] are never common, they too are seen in the cities of Sembara, although, like dwarves, there are no large stoneborn communities within the region.

I pushed a slightly updated structure for the Greater Sembara page, which I think is a good general structure for these main region pages. Let me know what you think, if you get a chance to look at it
rsulfuratus — 1/25/25, 1:25 PM
i like the greater sembara page a lot
obviously needs a bit of filling in, and such, but the basic structure feels very cohesive
Deciusmus — 1/25/25, 1:26 PM
do you have any sense what the geographic of central vostok is like?
rsulfuratus — 1/25/25, 1:27 PM
not really
Deciusmus — 1/25/25, 1:28 PM
i'm envisioning everything inside the yellow as "highlands"
Image
which nicely separates Tollen from Vostok except by sea
rsulfuratus — 1/25/25, 1:29 PM
the river patterns imply roughly that, yes
the hills east/south east of tollen should probably extend up the volta a bit. at one point this was thought to be source of metal for the tollen mint
but not sure if that is canonical
Deciusmus — 1/25/25, 1:31 PM
and I'm envisioning the "P" area to be a moderately high plateau (not Tibet or anything like that, but still 2000-4000 ft)
Image
but the ? I don't have a clear sense of
rsulfuratus — 1/25/25, 1:33 PM
probably in general it should be forest
i think the region north of the wall is only not forest because it is too dry
i think it is not really far enough north for tundra
Deciusmus — 1/25/25, 1:35 PM
right, I mean, the map has it as forest. right now I'm just trying to finish the "topography and major features" section of the greater sembara page
is it relatively low/flat, or is it hilly?
rsulfuratus — 1/25/25, 1:35 PM
actually something like this is maybe a good model: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_forest_steppe
Kazakh forest steppe
The Kazakh forest steppe ecoregion (WWF ID: PA0809) is a long thin strip of transition zone between the forested taiga of Siberian Russia (to the north), and the Kazakh steppe to the south. The ecoregion stretches over 2,000 km from the southern Ural mountains in the west to the foothills of Altai mountains in the east, yet averages only 200 km ...
Kazakh forest steppe
i think for topography, the area around the word "Vostok" is lowlands
(ish)
and the vostok coast is fairly flat until you get to near the mountains
something like the saint lawerence gulf coast of canada
Image
the dark blue are highlands, with the plateau with the lake maybe kind of like lake yellowston
river valleys slope down towards the coast in light blue
with light blue circle coastal lowlands
Deciusmus — 1/25/25, 1:41 PM
yeah I think that makes sense
rsulfuratus — 1/25/25, 1:42 PM
this fits with the cultural history description of the northwest corner of vostok really being part of zimkova
Deciusmus — 1/25/25, 1:42 PM
where perhaps a northern forest/taiga/interior maine type climate gives way to your kazakh forest steppe as the elevation gets higher and drier
rsulfuratus — 1/25/25, 1:43 PM
right, since most of the moisture comes from the green sea by the time you get to 4000 feet it is cold and dry
not obvious on the map but i think the idea would be that the lowland rivers have many unmapped tributaries but the "lake yellowstone" area does not
Deciusmus — 1/25/25, 1:57 PM
ok so something like this:
Image
rsulfuratus — 1/25/25, 1:59 PM
yeah

where pink = highlands, blue = lowlands, 
#1 - "Zimkova foothills" - hilly "highland" terrain, mostly forested, many rivers and lakes that are not on the map, plus the big ones that are. Zimka culture
#2  - "Vostok High Plateau" - yellostone-esque, blank culturally (but lightly peopled)
#3 - Mostreve Hills
#4 - main Sembaran lowland
#5 = Maseau Plains (distinct and drier than main lowland, bit of Mostreve Hills rain shadow/less moisture from Green Sea)
#6 = "Vostok lowlands" (eastern Canada) with the green lines rising up to the hills
#7 - undefined Tollen highlands, separates tollen from Vostok, probably a blank slate for right now but no people really
#8 = coastal highlands, also likely undefined and probably Skaer
6 is basically the "Kem Watershed"; 4 is the "Semb/Wistel/Volta watersheds"
