(I guess you are probably driving or hiking or something, anyway.... back to Taelgar...)

As I try to collate a lot of the history post-Downfall, there are some gaps that keep coming up as "undefined / undetermined" which make telling a cohesive narrative somewhat difficult.

Some of the gaps are irrelevant or intentional, but not all of them.

In particular, I think you can divide up the Drankorian world into basically six areas:

(a) the core coastal plains including Drankor itself

(b) the Istaros river valley

(c) the Nevos Sea/Illoria/Apporia

(d) the near Green Sea shores: South Cymea/eastern mountains/southern Cymea - the whole sorta ill-defined section along the south western Green Sea

(e) Greater Sembara

(f) the west coast

Of those (a), (b), and (e) are pretty well defined, at least in terms of the influence of Drankor on post-Drankorian history

Deciusmus — Today at 2:40 PM

(c) and (f) have numerous open questions, but the very big picture is pretty well defined (although there are some questions as to when Illoria is conqueored by Drankor or really if it canonicaly should have been?)

(d) is a gaping blank area in the history

rsulfuratus — Today at 2:48 PM

We are back now

I was driving then doing errands

if you want to get stuff you can swing by whenever

Deciusmus — Today at 2:51 PM

we just got home from eating lunch in davis but I might swing by later

rsulfuratus — Today at 2:51 PM

re: Taelgar history, i think the problem with (d) is that, in general, the modern day details don't really exist either

so it is hard to make up a history

we have some brainstorming notes, i believe, that attempt to explain why drankor expanded north and west, but not really east very far, since the geography is a bit atypical for an empire in some sense

Deciusmus — Today at 2:53 PM

yeah there is a lot of brainstorming notes that I haven't fully looked through

rsulfuratus — Today at 2:57 PM

i think from a worldbuilding perspective, the stuff east of the mountains east of drankor is canonically 'not Drankorian' but beyond that it is a bit of a blank slate, intentionally so

Deciusmus — Today at 2:58 PM

Right the area I'm talking about is this yellow circle:

![[history-brainstorming-map-1.png]]

rsulfuratus — Today at 2:58 PM

but i guess this leaves (d) as kind of a big hole that could use filling, since that is west of those mountains

yeah

Deciusmus — Today at 2:58 PM

Everything to the east of that circle is "intentionally poorly defined"

rsulfuratus — Today at 2:58 PM

a good chunk of southern part of that circle was [[rostaure]]

basically the entire north shore of that weird bay

Deciusmus — Today at 2:59 PM

to the west and north (with a few exceptions around Cymea) is fairly well defined

rsulfuratus — Today at 2:59 PM

no idea what is there now, though. presumably wilderness

Deciusmus — Today at 3:00 PM

is [[rostaure]] meant to be another surival of the big pre-downfall elves? or a new foundation

?

we had a lot of talk earlier about a huge Pantal/Everglades inland swamp, but I think that was to the east of the circle

I think the theory is that most of that coastline along the green sea (between the mountain ranges) would have been empty land post-Downfall

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:01 PM

never decided

i think the big lizardfolk swamps became the southern green sea after the downfall

but were east of the mountains, anyway

Deciusmus — Today at 3:03 PM

In a bunch of the green sea brainstorming we had discussed the fact that there is no large swampland on Taelgar, and I think were considering something south of the "mariener trade peninusla" as having survived

but that's in the "intentionally blank space" out east

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:03 PM

right, yeah

Deciusmus — Today at 3:04 PM

In fact, it is really only the red circle here that is poorly defined:

Image

the squiggly yellow presumably never recovers from the plague. Although it isn't clear to me where the proto-Dunmari were or came from or went to

the blue circle becomes Isingue

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:07 PM

early on, i had the dunmari migration from undetermined homeland split, with some going ??? (variously, what we later called MTP or the red circle), and the rest continuing west to Dunmar

although the split is canonical, i've increasingly felt it doesn't really make sense for the other part of the dunmari to have settled so close to Dunmar (e.g, red circle), separated only from Dunmar by Isingue (which is hardly a barrier)

it

it's never really fit with the vibe of Dunmar for there to have been a second branch of the Dunmari so close - it really only works if they are far/distant/lost somehow

Deciusmus — Today at 3:09 PM

So would it make sense for the dunmari homeland to be "out east" and after the split some of them went back towards the homeland?

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:09 PM

that seems more logical

Deciusmus — Today at 3:09 PM

canonically the split was in the headwaters of that river that divides the yellow and red areas, right?

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:10 PM

it is not clearly determined, actually

Deciusmus — Today at 3:10 PM

But actually having the Dunmari homeland way out east simplifies alot of the Drankorian cultural history, as the Dunmari can just "appear" from nowhere basically, they were either on the fringes of Drankor or just far enough away that Drankor was only a legend

story/whatever

the other question that came up on the dunmari migration is... were there any drankorians still in the coastal plain they were riding into? or is this meant to all be plague-scarred and depopulated?

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:12 PM

the traditional three great rivers of Dunmar are the Hara, Kharja, and Mahar (Istaros), and the country is more or less founded on the banks of the Kharja.

  

but the split could happen either at the Istaros (Mahar) or an eastern tributary

re: drankorians - it is not necesarily clear how true the religious history of the dunmari has to be.

but the vibe of the founding myth is supposed to be:

dunmari ride, driven by their gods, into what is basically a dying land. exactly how/why the land is dying is not stated, but presumably an aftereffect of the plague

jeevali performs great miracle to heal the land, makes everything better, dies, is reborn

the dunmari kill / drive out everyone who was living there, saying the gods saved the land for them

so the implication is that some people may have survived. or, possibly, it was undead, or plague demons, or ???

Deciusmus — Today at 3:17 PM

Right. So a canonical way of putting it might be:

  

Shortly after the fall of Drankor, a new people, the Dunmari, sweep west, from an undetermined homeland somewhere east of the Drankorian sphere of influence.

These Dunmari, speaking a unique language and worshipping their own gods, rapidly establish a new homeland - that they claim their gods have given to them - across the coastal plains

Whatever they are displacing - surviving humans? undead? plague demons? - is not clear, but by (XXX date) the sweap of land from (X) to (Y) is clearly Dunmari

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:18 PM

yeah the vibe is supposed to be somewhat like spread of islam right after the death of muhammad - very quick

the founding is DR 1171 - DR 1173, roughly, and the dunmar probably expand to the modern "[[Hara Basin]]" plus some of the area stretching east to the Mahar (modern day Xurkhaz) within 10 years

the exact borders are a little vague because it is not clear exactly what is happening with Isingue at this time, and how far south it expands, etc

Deciusmus — Today at 3:23 PM

in the historical framework doc I'm working on I have the fall of Drankor being ~15 years, and had dunmars founding as part of that (short) era

right, I think the exact borders here don't matter, as it is distrubted again with the Great War

but isingue and dunmar are presumably neighbors

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:24 PM

yeah in the high school maps we had that (with old names)

the vibe in the pre-great-war dunmari history is that they thrive on trade passing from isingue to chardon

i think the fall of drankor era is probably longer than 15 years.

  

i mean, the immediate fall of drankor is very, very fast, basically just a single day when cha'mutte traps apollyon and unleashes the plague

Deciusmus — Today at 3:26 PM

I guess it is probably more like a hundred years of unclear disruptions and resettlements

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:29 PM

i think the two things in my head here are:

(1) the plague doesn't immediately curse the land. the city of drankor is haunted by the plague dead, and hard to survive in, but you have a kind of creeping corruption spread out from drankor, and over the next few years crops fail, cities die and are abandoned, etc

(2) Apollyon was already in the process of centralizing a lot of things, collecting knowledge to himself, trying to suppress Mos Numena, etc. but his power base is very central, driven by the fact that all the important people in drankor are magically under his control. so there is already some tension between the center and the periphery.

so i think this could lead to a bunch of chaos for a while. you have refugees fleeing north and west and east; maybe Sembaran/Cymea declare themselves a new Drankorian Empire for a time but it breaks down / falls apart for various reasons (not the least of which might be the loss of important magical knowledge - e.g., Drankor helped keep things together with teleportation circles, but these are clearly lost magic now)

we have some scattered dates - the First Duke of Sembara in 1142; the founding of Dunmar in 1171, - the suggest a kind of resurgence really not until the mid 1100s at the earliest

there is also a possibility for supernatural / magical events to come into play here

Deciusmus — Today at 3:33 PM

right.

partly, I just did the math wrong and thought it was canonically immediately after the plague

its 5304 not 5204

(drankor falls in 5192)

but it makes sense to say basically 5192 - 5300 is "the fall of Drankor" and a time of chaos, etc where we don't really try to define events per se. I don't see a ton of value in making up a lot of events in the chaos speculatively, although it is a good time period to place some kind of odd catastrophy or magical problem or whatever

is the idea that the northerns landed first in Iloria important to keep as canon?

rsulfuratus — Today at 3:37 PM

no

Deciusmus — Today at 3:38 PM

I think there is more flexibility to develop Illoria if we leave it unclear where exactly the first northeners landed

i.e. maybe Illoria is really Southerner

or at least, part southerner
