# Discord DM – 2025-02-03

[2025-02-03 12:33 PM] Deciusmus: I'm probably going to try to do a little cleanup on gazetter today - a few little topics:
    
    (a) any objections to starting to separate out articles on places from peoples? 
    3 examples:
    - Drankor (the city) vs Drankorian Empire (the empire)
    - Skaer (the people) vs Skaerhaem (the islands)
    - Cymea (the province(s)) vs Cymean Peninsula (the place)
    
    (b) I think we agreed all unnamed places should go in staging? Might try to clean that up a bit
[2025-02-03 12:37 PM] Deciusmus: Cymean Rivers:
![[../_discord_assets/image-E629F.png]]
[2025-02-03 12:37 PM] Deciusmus: which one is Freccilia
[2025-02-03 12:37 PM] Deciusmus: red blue or yellow
[2025-02-03 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: (c) what brush did you use for rivers, do you know? there are 1 or 2 sembara tributaries I'd like to add to the official amp
[2025-02-03 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus: For (c) - Rivers: KYLE sketch pencil rough (1 or 2), play with size, flow; color `#181f5a`
[2025-02-03 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus: For (b) - yes, that is good to do. you might grab my dataview query from the Cosmology landing page to just make a table of backlinks in staging in directory in the dm notes for each region page
[2025-02-03 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus: For (a) - reasonable; i think that we decided to put off for now final decisions about what belongs in Gazetteer vs elsewhere but it makes sense to make the pages. the Dunmar directory is already largely organized this way (separate pages on realms vs geography)
[2025-02-03 12:54 PM] Deciusmus: yeah for (a) wasn't going to move anything out of gazetter
[2025-02-03 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus: Also for (a) - really Drankor (the place) and all the other places in the "history" should be moved to gazetteer and Drankorian Empire (the realm) should probably stay in history for now
[2025-02-03 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus: but pretty sure the place pages are all just stubs anyway and need me to fill in from my notes
[2025-02-03 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i have a meeting in 5 minutes but when i get a chance this afternoon i need to figure out some fey politics for tomorrow and it would be helpful to understand a bit more of the context and the intended development for some of the stuff that touches on amberglow (i think from obsidian greymalkin and aelirios sunblade but i'm not totally clear)
[2025-02-03 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`from your game
[2025-02-03 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: For (c) - you can make a new layer "new rivers" or something to test to make sure it looks good so you don't accidentally mess up existing rivers
[2025-02-03 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: later this can be merged with the existing rivers
[2025-02-03 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: Greymalkin's Story has pretty much everything I've made up
[2025-02-03 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus: I was looking at this comment in Aeliros Sunblade:
    
    `%%` There is some background in [[Greymalkin's Story]] but I haven't really made anything up. I do have plans to use him some more `%%`
[2025-02-03 12:58 PM] Deciusmus: ah
[2025-02-03 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: there are hints at some important story between Cedric / the Lantern of the Bright Hearth / Aerlirios Sunblade / the Order of the Charitable Wanderer but it isn't really clear exactly how it all connects and how, if at all, it connects back to Amberglow
[2025-02-03 01:02 PM] Deciusmus: I'm adding a page of The Refuge of the Gossamer Veil with the vibes so far
[2025-02-03 01:02 PM] Deciusmus: but basically this is all post Cloudspinner; these events are all in the time period say 1300 - 1500 or so
[2025-02-03 01:03 PM] Deciusmus: the only real idea is that Aerlirios was a fey paladin/warrior of some sort who was guarding/protecting some pocket of Amberglow that he was trying to keep safe / keep from falling to various forces that might be trying to take it over
[2025-02-03 01:04 PM] Deciusmus: he had some type of relationship with Cedric (a Tyrwinghan) - although Cedric's dates shouldn't be considered canonical
[2025-02-03 01:05 PM] Deciusmus: he made a fancy magic item for Cedric
[2025-02-03 01:05 PM] Deciusmus: the other key thing about Aerlirios was that he died when Umbraeth took over the Refuge of the Gossamer Veil
[2025-02-03 01:05 PM] Deciusmus: so in 1749 this is all history - this is part of Duskmire now
[2025-02-03 01:06 PM] Deciusmus: Cedric is kinda constructed to be a heroic inspiration/precursing to one of my PCs (Robin) with the idea that Robin could, in some fashion, be compared back to him / find his stuff / etc.
[2025-02-03 01:07 PM] Deciusmus: But I think the whole order of the charitable wanderer connection doesn't really work, and I never introduced it in game, because it seemed off
[2025-02-03 01:08 PM] Deciusmus: So really the only thing that I'd consider canonical is what's the Greymalkin's story. And the dates for Cedric probably need to move to pre-Great War, although I guess it is undetermined when Umbraeth took over the Refugee of the Gossamer Veil
[2025-02-03 01:09 PM] Deciusmus: The only real connection to Cloudspinner is that Aerilois Sunblade was presumably one of her knights (but actually, it he could have been born after she died, and could have just grown up in the Refuge, it isn't really clear)
[2025-02-03 01:24 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed some updates
[2025-02-03 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: Basically look at the new Refuge of Gossamar Veil page; I dropped the Charitable Wanderer connection and dumped a bunch of `%%` notes on my intended goals for these characters in the future. If you wanted to make Aerilios part of some larger "pro Cloudspinner" group, or have Aerilios' reason for caring about Cedric Cynwild be something to do with covert support Ethlenn was providing to refugees in Amberglow those both work.
    
    The chat on "Discord Chat - Fey Realms" in obisidian has a lot of (still accurate) stuff about Ethllen/Umbraeth/plans etc although I've committed very little of that as canonical
[2025-02-03 01:37 PM] rsulfuratus: where is the Refuge of the Gossamar Veil supposed to be? Do you have any clear sense of the borders of Duskmire in 1720?
[2025-02-03 01:38 PM] Deciusmus: there is a map on the Duskmire page
[2025-02-03 01:40 PM] Deciusmus: although the southern border is not canonical
[2025-02-03 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: that is slightly inaccurate in some details, e.g. Addermarch is not part of Ethlenn's domain and the sunset gate should run (mostly) north-south, with the darkwood on the west side, not the east side
[2025-02-03 01:40 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, it is old
[2025-02-03 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: (although the sunset gate doesn't have to be perfectly north-south)
[2025-02-03 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: so wondering what is fixed and what is variable. the expansion of duskmire northwest to cleenseau obviously fixed
[2025-02-03 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: basically the only canonical stuff is
    (a) Duskmire was originally just the Darkwood, which is just on the western side of Sunset Gate
    (b) Duskmire expanded after Cloudspinner was captured to include some fragments of the northern part of Amberglow (time and details not determined)
    (c) Duskmire today stretches as far north as the Wistel and includes the whole Cleenseau wood, but the western and eastern borders are unclear
[2025-02-03 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: (d) Duskmire does **not** stretch as far east as Fellburn
[2025-02-03 01:44 PM] rsulfuratus: right, fellburn area is presumably lord serenveil
[2025-02-03 01:44 PM] rsulfuratus: sunset gate something like?
![[../_discord_assets/image-3F1F8.png]]
[2025-02-03 01:44 PM] Deciusmus: right, or a similar vassal state
[2025-02-03 01:45 PM] Deciusmus: that works, although I don't think it has to push as far east
[2025-02-03 01:46 PM] Deciusmus: although it does need to touch Twlight's Grace somewhere
[2025-02-03 01:46 PM] Deciusmus: but it doesn't have to be the full border
[2025-02-03 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: i was just following major geographic features - istaros to hills to enst to coast to volta
[2025-02-03 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: i am pretty sure i want addermarch on the other side of the sunset gate from twilight's grace
[2025-02-03 01:47 PM] rsulfuratus: and actively contested between duskmire and ethlenn vassals but not ethlenn herself
[2025-02-03 01:47 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-02-03 01:47 PM] Deciusmus: it should follow this line:
    Here an ancient line of border stones running to [[~High Peak of Tyrwinghan Ridge~]] demarcates the border with [[Tyrwingha]]. These stones are said by some to be raised by Drankor, but they are marked with complex warnings in [[Sylvan Writing|Sylvan]], and many believe they have fey origins.
[2025-02-03 01:48 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that is the idea
[2025-02-03 01:48 PM] rsulfuratus: but it could for example follow the teft instead of the volta, not sure that really matters in the north
[2025-02-03 01:49 PM] Deciusmus: yeah it doesn't matter to me. the Teft might make it a bit more in line with where it "should be"
[2025-02-03 01:52 PM] rsulfuratus: so you have then:
![[../_discord_assets/image-78377.png]]
[2025-02-03 01:52 PM] rsulfuratus: shimmersong is yellow
[2025-02-03 01:52 PM] rsulfuratus: duskmire dark green
[2025-02-03 01:53 PM] rsulfuratus: basically, duskmire can expand east as far as the mountains
[2025-02-03 01:53 PM] rsulfuratus: (this is potentially before cloudspinner's capture as this is probably further north than amberglow)
[2025-02-03 01:53 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`west
[2025-02-03 01:53 PM] Deciusmus: I think the key question is where is the northern border of AMberglow before her capture
[2025-02-03 01:53 PM] rsulfuratus: then the arrows are incursions into amberglow basically
[2025-02-03 01:53 PM] Deciusmus: Are you thinking the Andonne, basically?
[2025-02-03 01:54 PM] rsulfuratus: roughly but not 100% exactly where and also need to give a bit of thought to isingue and a few other things
[2025-02-03 01:55 PM] Deciusmus: I personally think the history of Duskmire works a little bit better if Umbraeth can't easily expand when it is first granted, and he only grows when Cloudspinner falls
[2025-02-03 01:56 PM] rsulfuratus: right, but that's doesn't have to imply that amberglow borders darkwood
[2025-02-03 01:56 PM] Deciusmus: which suggests that the Maseau Gap/March of Andonne area probably should not have been "open"
[2025-02-03 01:56 PM] Deciusmus: right, no didn't mean that
[2025-02-03 01:56 PM] Deciusmus: just that it was probably Amberglow vassal states or whatever.
[2025-02-03 01:56 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2025-02-03 01:57 PM] Deciusmus: In fact, the Refugee of the Gossamar Veil could have been a mini-realm supported by Cloudspinner, not part of Amberglow proper
[2025-02-03 01:57 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the unanswered question (more for your campaign than mine) is there needs to be something keeping duskmire from expanding north early that then fails
[2025-02-03 01:57 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. what lets duskmire take cleenseau?
[2025-02-03 01:58 PM] Deciusmus: Ah, that is the Great War
[2025-02-03 01:58 PM] Deciusmus: we worked that out already in the chat
[2025-02-03 01:58 PM] Deciusmus: unless you have concerns, the idea was that pre-Great War Sharpshire stretched as far east as Cleanseau/Rinburg, but didn't go south of the Enst
[2025-02-03 01:59 PM] Deciusmus: then when "mystery weird thing" replaced Sharpshire with "scary danger", Umbraeth took advantage
[2025-02-03 01:59 PM] rsulfuratus: ah hmm yeah i was not imagining sharpspire extending that far east into the lowlands
[2025-02-03 02:00 PM] rsulfuratus: but umbreath could have been constrained in other ways
[2025-02-03 02:00 PM] rsulfuratus: if you imagine that, originally, Sharpspire, Amberglow, and Twilight's Grace are three strong fey realms, allied to a degree that share a somewhat common purpose and morality
[2025-02-03 02:01 PM] rsulfuratus: that puts a lot of eyes on the upper istaros and southern sembara
[2025-02-03 02:01 PM] rsulfuratus: even if there is some other random fey realms scattered around there, hard for umbreath to make a move with the three "major powers" of the east watching him
[2025-02-03 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: Amberglow falls first, so duskmire can expand west / southwest
[2025-02-03 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: Sharpspire falls next, duskmire can expand north
[2025-02-03 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: isn't really relevant exactly where the borders of these realms are
[2025-02-03 02:03 PM] rsulfuratus: (or at least, it might be relevant but the exact details don't matter for your campaign if the basic pattern of expansion holds)
[2025-02-03 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2025-02-03 02:03 PM] rsulfuratus: ethlenn's vassals still hold on in fellburn, wistel, ozabal, etc
[2025-02-03 02:04 PM] rsulfuratus: so that is the contested area now. ethlenn being the only of the three original "fey powers" still active in 1720
[2025-02-03 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: there is actually probably more like 4 or 5 powers, because there needs to be something in the north as well
[2025-02-03 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: although the exact details don't matter
[2025-02-03 02:05 PM] Deciusmus: but you could imagine something like:
![[../_discord_assets/image-C23E7.png]]
[2025-02-03 02:05 PM] Deciusmus: where the pink circle is the "buffer zone" with no major archfey
[2025-02-03 02:05 PM] Deciusmus: but lots of minor fey mostly with allegiances to one of the "big players" on the outside
[2025-02-03 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm making a distinction between someone like the Lightdancer, who is clearly an archfey but also somewhat inward-looking, from the "big players" who are more outward-looking
[2025-02-03 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2025-02-03 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: the northern realms could be inward looking
[2025-02-03 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. there could be a sharp border in the north that duskmire can't expand into because it is controled by the Lord of the Beasts or whatever, but he is not a player in fey politics the way Ethlenn/Cloudspinner/unnamed lord of Sharpspire are/were
[2025-02-03 02:07 PM] Deciusmus: Actually from a fey politics perspective I like the idea of some kind of alliance between Ethlenn / Sharpshire / Cloudspinner and this zone of allies between them, where all of the fey lords there are basically vassals to one of them
[2025-02-03 02:08 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it is better to keep the "major powers" relatively few - of course room for more invention in the north and to the west but i think probably other fey powers in greater sembara + upper istaros + eastern dunmar should largely not be "big players"
[2025-02-03 02:08 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I agree
[2025-02-03 02:09 PM] Deciusmus: whatever keeps Umbraeth from moving east from duskmire or north is not well defined but also not a "big player" that looks outside its borders
[2025-02-03 02:09 PM] rsulfuratus: on a separate topic (related) - what is the Umbreath end game in your campaign? e.g. are you imagining your players are going to get deeply involved in fey politics and shake something up?
[2025-02-03 02:09 PM] rsulfuratus: re: east, mostly ethlenn allies, no?
[2025-02-03 02:11 PM] Deciusmus: re: Umbraeth. The basic plotline I'm setting up is about access to the Material Plane. It is canonically important that the places where Umbraeth can get to the Material Plane that are also places where there are a lot of people is relativelty limited
[2025-02-03 02:11 PM] Deciusmus: and in fact might JUST be the portal in the Cleenseau wood
[2025-02-03 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: (the others being in the darkwood or the northern plaguelands or whatever)
[2025-02-03 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: So the "victory" condition is basically to shut down that portal, and lock him out of the human world
[2025-02-03 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: at least, without treking across addermarch or maseau or whatever
[2025-02-03 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: I don't really envision them trying to overthrow Umbraeth or whatever, and Ethlenn is explicitly anti-expansionist
[2025-02-03 02:14 PM] Deciusmus: I _could_ see my players being interested in a high level quest to try to retake some of Duskmire or whatever but I think that would intriscincally have to be after Cloudspinner is restored, or they have no place for allies
[2025-02-03 02:15 PM] rsulfuratus: so obviously umbreath - assuming the situation is basically unchanged in 1749 - is going to have thoughts and feelings about Cloudspinner's return
[2025-02-03 02:15 PM] Deciusmus: yeah he's going to hate it
[2025-02-03 02:15 PM] Deciusmus: unless he can get her to agree in some way that everything that is his is his forever
[2025-02-03 02:15 PM] rsulfuratus: there are a few basic possibilities i'm toying with but i'm curious how important it is that he be tied up and not feature too much in the next dunmar arc
[2025-02-03 02:16 PM] Deciusmus: I do not think he needs to be tied up
[2025-02-03 02:17 PM] Deciusmus: There is this weird unresolved question of whether the Cleenseau campaign cut him off from the material plane or not; if they fail I think he'd care less about the southern part of his realm
[2025-02-03 02:18 PM] Deciusmus: but honestly, it is probably better to run him as if they succeeded, and there is no fey portal in Cleenseau; easy enough for someone else to have succeeded between 1720 and 1749 if my PCs dont (and realsitically, it is pretty unusual for PCs to fail at major quests)
[2025-02-03 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: i have another meeting but possibly more later
[2025-02-03 02:19 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I need to go get lunch before my 3pm meeting
[2025-02-03 06:21 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-889DE.png]]
[2025-02-03 06:22 PM] rsulfuratus: steel blue = shimmersong
    dark blue = sharpspire
    violet = twilight's grace
    yellow/orange = amberglow
    red = sunset gate
    
    exact boundries of dotted line "sphere of influence" not precise
[2025-02-03 06:23 PM] rsulfuratus: but basically:
    sharpspire = highlands
    amberglow = river valleys west of sunset gate
    twilight's grace = orenlas + sembaran lowlands + river valleys east of sunset gate
[2025-02-03 06:23 PM] Deciusmus: can you change sunset gate to run up the teft, btw. I do have an "along the sunset gate" adventure planned, which will _probably_ be along the Mostreve Hills Tyrwingha/Addermarch boundary but if I decide I don't want it there the Teft is much better than the Volta for various reasons
[2025-02-03 06:24 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2025-02-03 06:25 PM] Deciusmus: but the basic idea seems perfect
[2025-02-03 06:26 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-216D6.png]]
[2025-02-03 06:26 PM] rsulfuratus: dotted line being "sunset gate runs somewhere roughly here tbd"
[2025-02-03 06:28 PM] Deciusmus: Although I would prefer if we don't settle on a canonical northern edge of this - this map puts all of Sembara under Ethlenn's "sphere of influence" or sharpspire, and I'm not 100% convinced that is correct. But I think for your purposes the exact details of the northern boundaries here (i.e. is Ethlenn's sphere actually only as far north as the Semb, or the Sharpspire one only as far north as the Wistel) doesn't really matter
[2025-02-03 06:28 PM] Deciusmus: ?
[2025-02-03 06:28 PM] rsulfuratus: right the dotted lines are not canonical and have room for whatever
[2025-02-03 06:29 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't think the politics of the feywild north of the mostreve will come up in the cloudspinner arc
[2025-02-03 06:31 PM] rsulfuratus: you have presumably not given any thought to what is south of twilight's grace
[2025-02-03 06:31 PM] Deciusmus: none
[2025-02-03 06:31 PM] rsulfuratus: do you care?
[2025-02-03 06:31 PM] Deciusmus: I don't really have any strong feelings honestly
[2025-02-03 06:32 PM] Deciusmus: Although the general vibe of Tyrwingha has been... "be careful in the hills, folks, if you go too far you might stray over the line and meet dark and dangerous fey"
[2025-02-03 06:32 PM] Deciusmus: but that could just be leakage on the Material Plane from the Darkwood or whatever.
[2025-02-03 06:33 PM] Deciusmus: The fey and material plane geography might not have an exact correspondence here
[2025-02-03 06:34 PM] Deciusmus: basically the yellow circle here:
![[../_discord_assets/image-F1F96.png]]
[2025-02-03 06:35 PM] Deciusmus: should be, in parts at least, on Taelgar at least, somewhat dangerous, enough that folks in Tyrwingha warn people about "going too far up in the hills"
[2025-02-03 06:35 PM] Deciusmus: but why that is does not matter in the slightlest to me
[2025-02-03 06:35 PM] rsulfuratus: but umbreath is trapped west of the sunset gate so this is not umbreath, correct?
[2025-02-03 06:35 PM] Deciusmus: Although I might care about the details sometime this summer, so if you make something up, it can't stay secret forever
[2025-02-03 06:36 PM] rsulfuratus: well it isn't going to stay secret past March or April or whenever the cloudspinner arc finishes
[2025-02-03 06:37 PM] Deciusmus: As far as Umbraeth:
    * I don't think there should be a DIRECT border where Duskmire and Twilight's Grace touch each other
    * I had this idea that Umbraeth can't cross the Sunset Gate but that doesn't have to be canonical
[2025-02-03 06:37 PM] rsulfuratus: i like the umbraeth can't cross the sunset gate a lot
[2025-02-03 06:37 PM] rsulfuratus: i think addermarch works well as "contested territory" that is a buffer
[2025-02-03 06:37 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2025-02-03 06:38 PM] rsulfuratus: so the west part of your yellow circle is addermarch contested land, the east part is maybe something else, with the sunset gate running in the middle
[2025-02-03 06:38 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-02-03 06:39 PM] Deciusmus: yes. although the ENTIRE yellow circle doesnt' have to be dangerous. The only canonical thing I'm working with here is a general vibe in the foothill/border towns in Tyrwingha that the hills aren't safe, and that in particular, the fey you might encounter in the hills _might_ be dangerous in unexpected ways
[2025-02-03 06:39 PM] rsulfuratus: also i assume the sunset gate doesn't have to be fixed - i.e. there is no reason it couldn't have moved after cloudspinner's disappearance
[2025-02-03 06:39 PM] Deciusmus: the plaguelands provides plenty of "non-fey" dangers
[2025-02-03 06:39 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-02-03 06:39 PM] Deciusmus: the only thing about the sunset gate is it is meant to be the actual line of sunset
[2025-02-03 06:40 PM] Deciusmus: I have no opinions about whether the actual line of sunset can move or not
[2025-02-03 06:41 PM] Deciusmus: secondarily, btw, there is no requirement that this "Dangerous fey area" has to have predated the Great War
[2025-02-03 06:41 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. it could have been that Ethlenn retreated due to some impact of the Plague/red mist
[2025-02-03 06:44 PM] Deciusmus: As an aside, looking at that map, I actually think it might work better if the Refuge of the Gossamer Veil was in the "Amberglow influence" area, not in Amberglow itself.
[2025-02-03 06:55 PM] rsulfuratus: Right. I think my idea is that all the feywild is divided into domains of influence, but “Amberglow proper” or whatever might be smaller than “amberglow extended”
[2025-02-03 06:55 PM] rsulfuratus: But in some sense the distinction is a bit artificial
[2025-02-03 06:56 PM] rsulfuratus: It just gives space for inventing a bunch of minor archfey and allows boundaries to be sharp in some places and gradual in others
[2025-02-03 06:58 PM] rsulfuratus: Separately: my feeling is that some archfey (ethlenn, cloud spinner among those invented so far) are ancient (possibly predating the riving) and significantly more powerful than “typical archfey”
[2025-02-03 06:59 PM] rsulfuratus: Others are various gradations of power. But probably there are not more than half a dozen of the “great fey” or whatever in the region from west coast through western green sea
[2025-02-03 07:39 PM] rsulfuratus: do you pay for chatgpt? i don't know if they have updated things recently but I've found the recent versions of the 4o model to be shockingly creative
[2025-02-03 07:39 PM] Deciusmus: I do not
[2025-02-03 07:39 PM] rsulfuratus: kind of want to put this somewhere: 
    
    Gloamscar – A land where daylight has been wounded, the sky torn open to reveal something older and darker than the Feywild itself, watched over by the fey warlock Severance, Keeper of the Rift.
[2025-02-03 07:39 PM] rsulfuratus: (the names often need some pushing although that one is not bad)
[2025-02-03 07:40 PM] Deciusmus: I have often wondered what this is:
![[../_discord_assets/image-42555.png]]
[2025-02-03 07:40 PM] Deciusmus: maybe that's where Gloamscar is
[2025-02-03 07:46 PM] rsulfuratus: once i decide what I'm using for this adventure i'm going to dump 100 raw ideas from chatgpt in brainstorming for fey realms.
[2025-02-03 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: you said you had some umbraeth enemy stats?
[2025-02-03 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`servant
[2025-02-03 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: duskhounds?
[2025-02-03 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: not that i would use them exactly but might be useful to see the vibes
[2025-02-03 09:08 PM] Deciusmus: Yes I have a stated duskhound. I’m not at my computer but can send you in a bit
[2025-02-03 09:08 PM] Deciusmus: It’s aimed to be “boss-level” for 6th level party
[2025-02-03 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: I have a couple of other stat’d fey enemies as well if you want - other bosses mostly for my current “fey enemies” arc
[2025-02-03 09:10 PM] rsulfuratus: i'd take a look
[2025-02-03 09:10 PM] rsulfuratus: the new monster manual is coming out tomorrow so i may also see if there is anything interesting in there
[2025-02-03 09:11 PM] rsulfuratus: supposed to have more interesting high level monsters
[2025-02-03 09:11 PM] rsulfuratus: there is rumored to be a statblock for a city-sized ooze, for example, just coincidentally
[2025-02-03 09:18 PM] Deciusmus: not sure the best way to share bestiary. I have a bunch of stuff stat'd in obsidian in my DM folder..
[2025-02-03 09:18 PM] rsulfuratus: just put it in mechanics and push it
[2025-02-03 09:18 PM] rsulfuratus: (in worldbuilding)
[2025-02-03 09:19 PM] Deciusmus: I forgot we had a worldbuilding\mechanics
[2025-02-03 09:19 PM] Deciusmus: do you have the fantasy stat block plugin?
[2025-02-03 09:19 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-02-03 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: pushed
[2025-02-03 09:24 PM] Deciusmus: in play my PCs fought 2 different duskhounds; one was a ordered to stay put and guard a retreat, so didn't use its mostly infinite misty step mobility. That was not super hard (esp as the whole party made the save against fright aura).
    
    The other was jumping around with every attack and was much much more of a challenge.
[2025-02-03 09:43 PM] rsulfuratus: one more. my sense of umbraeth's vibe is all about rigged games, about cruelty, about the idea of the hunt. despite the way the duskhounds are statted it really isn't about like the fear of darkness or traditional ghost story kind of things
[2025-02-03 09:43 PM] rsulfuratus: is that the vibe from your game?
[2025-02-03 09:44 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2025-02-03 09:45 PM] Deciusmus: The fey bosses are probably a bit more “themed”
[2025-02-03 09:45 PM] Deciusmus: But ultimately the duskhounds have a bit of an enforcer vibe
[2025-02-03 09:46 PM] Deciusmus: They are supposed to be a bit mindless
[2025-02-03 09:46 PM] rsulfuratus: right yeah, but the fear aura is more about they are scary (like how a dragon is scary) than about some innate connection to fear (like how drankor is terrifying)
[2025-02-03 09:46 PM] Deciusmus: I mean not actually mindless. But they aren’t his lieutenants- they are more like his muscle
[2025-02-03 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: i am making a minion version of duskhounds for you all
[2025-02-03 09:47 PM] Deciusmus: Yes, the fear aura more about “they are scary”
[2025-02-03 09:51 PM] Deciusmus: I do see the duskhounds as a little bit like “mini Nazgûl” or something less like soldiers, ie I wouldn’t expect them in general to be quite as weak as minions, although I guess some minions can be relatively strong
[2025-02-03 09:51 PM] Deciusmus: Or ie I wouldn’t expect Umbraeth to have 100s of them around.
[2025-02-03 09:52 PM] rsulfuratus: ah okay, the vibe seemed a bit more like the foot soliders
[2025-02-03 09:52 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe i'll make something else to be the foot soliders them
[2025-02-03 09:52 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`then
[2025-02-03 09:52 PM] Deciusmus: Ive been running them as more like lieutenants than foot soldiers
[2025-02-03 09:53 PM] Deciusmus: He has sent single ones of them to enforce stuff
