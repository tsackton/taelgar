# Discord DM – 2024-04-05

[2024-04-05 04:33 PM] rsulfuratus: cleaning up some status tags and ran into an issue. Bas Udda was burned down by gnolls in April 1748, but resettled in Nov 1748. having a created date later than destroyed date breaks things.
    
    I think best option here is just to use campaign info for this, instead of created/destroyed, but curious what you think
[2024-04-05 04:37 PM] Deciusmus: I think having a block in the body of the text like
    
    `%%`^Date:1748`%%`
    In April of 1748... and in Nov of 1748
    `%%`^End`%%`
    
    And then not set the created destroyed (or set the created to the "original foundation")
[2024-04-05 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: If you want lines to appear in the header, campaign info I guess is fine but I've become less of a fan of a lot of header lines
[2024-04-05 04:41 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess Bas Udda is a bit of a weird case since the destruction and resettlement are both in the past. 
    
    the general case though is that if taelgarverse in its current form had existed in 3 years ago or whenever, I'd want the page to be "Burned by gnolls on XX date"
[2024-04-05 04:41 PM] rsulfuratus: but maybe trying to put it all in the header is not that useful
[2024-04-05 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: but I think I'd not overly worry about the non-existent game that is taking place in May 1748
[2024-04-05 04:43 PM] Deciusmus: like, if Taelgarverse had existing back then, you could have changed the page to be "burned by gnolls" and then updated it when it was resettled to no longer say "burned by gnolls" and have text instead
[2024-04-05 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: right. I guess that is the general solution, if a place is resettled just delete the destroyed date from the header and move to text
[2024-04-05 04:44 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-04-05 04:44 PM] Deciusmus: that doesn't work though if the resettlement is in the future compared to an active game
[2024-04-05 04:45 PM] Deciusmus: I think at some level worrying about the abstraction of "taelgarverse has to be able to reflect exactly what is happening on a specific random date" is too much trouble
[2024-04-05 04:45 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, like if Rinburg were destroyed by zombies in your game
[2024-04-05 04:45 PM] Deciusmus: Well I have a live example, Eftly, the little town that was destroyed by undead
[2024-04-05 04:45 PM] Deciusmus: But realistically, no one cares or has even decided if it gets resettled
[2024-04-05 04:46 PM] Deciusmus: so it doesn't matter that on your taelgarverse it shows upa s "destroyed by a ghast creature, 1720"
[2024-04-05 04:47 PM] Deciusmus: But if in a year we are hunting clues about the Isingue acid monster and you want to reuse a bunch of the Enst valley stuff rather than setting the clue hunting somewhere else, it could in theory be a problem
[2024-04-05 04:48 PM] rsulfuratus: at one point I actually looked a bit at basically abstracting the whereabouts logic to essentially every header piece of information
[2024-04-05 04:48 PM] Deciusmus: In theory I don't think it would be that hard to either introduce the idea ofa "Second life", i.e. say a page can have
    created/destroyed/born/died
    recreated/redestroyed/reborn/reallykilled
[2024-04-05 04:48 PM] Deciusmus: that could also work for undead, as an aside
[2024-04-05 04:49 PM] rsulfuratus: right, I think the most robust way to do it would be to abstract whereabouts logic to page existence
[2024-04-05 04:49 PM] Deciusmus: or, alternatively, allow created to be after destroyed, and handle that as a special case (i.e. it isn't really destroyed for age/existance stuff, but you show the destroyed line)
[2024-04-05 04:50 PM] Deciusmus: or alternatively try to do something generic but I 'm not sure how whereabouts logic abstracts, actually
[2024-04-05 04:50 PM] Deciusmus: because there is no "location"
[2024-04-05 04:50 PM] rsulfuratus: location is just a binary. exists/doesn't
[2024-04-05 04:50 PM] rsulfuratus: or, rather, exists or unknown, with unknown meaning dead
[2024-04-05 04:52 PM] rsulfuratus: so a person born in 1650, killed in 1700, resurrected in 1744 would be someting like:
    - home, 1650
    - away, 1700
    - home, 1774
[2024-04-05 04:52 PM] rsulfuratus: current whereabouts logic would set location to "home" for 1650-1700, unknown for 1700-1744, and home from 1744-current
[2024-04-05 04:52 PM] rsulfuratus: home = alive, unknown = dead
[2024-04-05 04:53 PM] rsulfuratus: would want to abstract it a bit so that we don't use home/away keywords and don't have a location and such
[2024-04-05 04:54 PM] rsulfuratus: but I'm pretty sure it would work=
[2024-04-05 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: right, I see what you mean
[2024-04-05 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: something like
    existance:
    - { type: exist, start: 1650, end: 1700 }
    - { type: exist, start: 1744 }
[2024-04-05 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: you could then add "startStatus"  / "endStatus"
[2024-04-05 05:01 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah something like that
[2024-04-05 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: actually I don't thik you need type or the concept of away at
[2024-04-05 05:01 PM] rsulfuratus: no, you wouldn't, i forgot about end:
[2024-04-05 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: use the same whereabouts logic but just for "home"
[2024-04-05 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: and "last known"
[2024-04-05 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: so basically you get the home and/or last know
[2024-04-05 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: right, if you have a home, you are alive. if not, you died at last known date
[2024-04-05 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: (alive = exist)
[2024-04-05 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: if you have a home, you are "alive" with a start status of start and an age of end - start
    if you don't have a home, you are "dead", with a start status of start, age of end, etc
[2024-04-05 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, what you said
[2024-04-05 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: would actually be a way to deal with mirror people, better than whereabouts if the age calculations excluded periods of being dead
[2024-04-05 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking the age would always basically be from "current" start to end
[2024-04-05 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: that works better for places, for example
[2024-04-05 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. Eftly, founded 1689, destroyed 1720, refounded 1730, if you wanted to calc the age it would be since refounding, I think
[2024-04-05 05:05 PM] rsulfuratus: yes. but for people it is a bit weird. someone who was dead and resurrected 1 year ago is not 1 year old
[2024-04-05 05:05 PM] Deciusmus: true
[2024-04-05 05:06 PM] Deciusmus: although for undead it might make sense to say something like
    
    died in xxx at age y, arose as a vampire in z (10 years ago)
[2024-04-05 05:06 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-04-05 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: probably easiest to start with just calculating age of the most recent period of existence, and then if someone wanted to fiddle could add a parsing token to age that would indicate total age (sum all existence intervals) instead of last age. which might be a little tricky
[2024-04-05 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: anwyay, not going to do anything about it now but worth keeping in mind
[2024-04-05 05:07 PM] Deciusmus: yup
[2024-04-05 05:08 PM] Deciusmus: are you writing up a tristan piece btw or waiting for more people to chime in?
[2024-04-05 05:08 PM] rsulfuratus: i wrote something, it is stuck in moderation on the list. not sure who owns it
[2024-04-05 05:08 PM] Deciusmus: ah
[2024-04-05 05:08 PM] Deciusmus: I'll ping kiya
