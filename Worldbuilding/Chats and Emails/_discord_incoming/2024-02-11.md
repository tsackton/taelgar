[2024-02-11 09:27 AM] rsulfuratus: looking at your Sembara/lich email, a few thoughts. 
    
    one thing that is not entirely clear to me is how much of this is supposed to be common knowledge in 1749. don't have to settle it all that soon but i think it shades how I think about some of the events you describe, and also might end up being relevant if the Dunmar group starts asking around about how to kill a lich
[2024-02-11 09:28 AM] rsulfuratus: so for example, "Battle of Something between Tollen and Sembara in 1720" fits in a lot better in the current 1749 vibe if it is widely known to be during the "lich interregnum"
[2024-02-11 09:30 AM] Deciusmus: I am definitely envisioning that the Lich interregnum is widely known
[2024-02-11 09:32 AM] Deciusmus: Some of the deeper plotting (ie relationship@with Umbraeth) probably secret and everyone would think the lich was totally defeated in summer 1720
[2024-02-11 09:32 AM] Deciusmus: Also when it started maybe not super clear.
[2024-02-11 09:33 AM] Deciusmus: But the six months from Jan - June 1720 would be widely known as “lich interregnum” basically from when the dead arose from the ground in winter 1720 until when he was defeated in summer 1720
[2024-02-11 09:33 AM] rsulfuratus: right, okay
[2024-02-11 09:36 AM] rsulfuratus: so I think what you describe fits fine with my feelingn about future history, then. the one thing I might say is that it might be slightly nicer to structure this as largely involving the south/west, and less tollen/highlanders, unless it is the only way to drive your players to tollen and you want them to go there
[2024-02-11 09:36 AM] rsulfuratus: the reason is that this is the period of tollen expansion when e.g. there are pirate wars and tollen starts establishing dominance over western cymea
[2024-02-11 09:37 AM] rsulfuratus: which works best if sembara sees tollen as a safe ally
[2024-02-11 09:37 AM] rsulfuratus: but of course a short blip is fine if needed for your campaign
[2024-02-11 09:38 AM] Deciusmus: I don’t really want my players to be interested in Tollen right now. Post lich they might go there to investigate backstory (still working on who the lich is and where he came from)
[2024-02-11 09:39 AM] Deciusmus: I just wanted a second thrust to the plan for background. My players are invested in the “Enst river valley” pretty heavily so Wisford as a major center is perfect
[2024-02-11 09:39 AM] Deciusmus: But I don’t want it to feel like “wisford vs the rest of sembara”
[2024-02-11 09:39 AM] rsulfuratus: one option to change the tollen vibe a bit and perhaps play into tollen history is to have the lich intentionally to a terrible job dealing with piracy on the western gulf
[2024-02-11 09:40 AM] rsulfuratus: that would be bad for telham and other coastal powers. maybe even telham is blamed for piracy
[2024-02-11 09:41 AM] rsulfuratus: sembara has never been a major naval power but if piracy is growing as a problem in the early 1700s they are probably not completely ignoring it. until the lich, and maybe that provides the opening for tollen to be seen as a savior and end up really dominant
[2024-02-11 09:41 AM] rsulfuratus: a thought, anyway
[2024-02-11 09:42 AM] rsulfuratus: might even be a way to try to get one of the more coastal powers to raise their own army and then declare them a traitor for it as a second front
[2024-02-11 09:44 AM] Deciusmus: The other idea I had was the zimka it is just less made up. But for example the lich could claim the reason the dead are rising has something to do with the baleful influence of the lingering kestavo
[2024-02-11 09:45 AM] Deciusmus: Which sets up a conflict along the north/west border as a second front (and gives me an excuse to inject some kestavo lore into the game)
[2024-02-11 09:45 AM] rsulfuratus: sure, that works too. actually i think the "night queen has withdrawn her favor" seems a little hard to pull off, since it isn't like actual clerics would notice and feels big enough the gods would kind of push back a little? not directly but at least in dreams or whatever
[2024-02-11 09:45 AM] rsulfuratus: so blaming foreign gods seems a lot easier for the lich to make work
[2024-02-11 09:46 AM] rsulfuratus: although if you convince the people the elders of the night queen are lying, then it works better
[2024-02-11 09:47 AM] rsulfuratus: but it does seem like a riskier plan for the lich than blaming kestavo
[2024-02-11 09:47 AM] Deciusmus: Right I was envisionig the night queen thing leading with the lich executing a group of 8 or so elders of the night queen
[2024-02-11 09:47 AM] Deciusmus: But it does seem risky. The kestavo is probably a sounder plan
[2024-02-11 09:48 AM] Deciusmus: And more disruptive to sembara as well as it plays to natural tensions in society rather than trying to create new ones
[2024-02-11 09:49 AM] rsulfuratus: that is a pretty good campaign hook for the campaign that the adventurers who end up killing the lich are part of: you start the campaign with everyone having a dream from the night queen summoning them on the quest
[2024-02-11 09:49 AM] rsulfuratus: but i would probably go with kestavo
[2024-02-11 09:56 AM] Deciusmus: In the kestavo world it’s probably  one of the coastal dukes who’s secretly in league with the lich, and one of the highland dukes (chemin or arnsbury) who ends up revolting perhaps after an attempted/partially successful crackdown on kestavo.
[2024-02-11 09:57 AM] Deciusmus: Perhaps the Duke of Seham is the main Lich plant, and mismanages the pirates (maybe even secretly helping) with the goal of keeping Tollen occupied
[2024-02-11 09:58 AM] Deciusmus: So it isn’t that the lich wants conflict with Tollen, he just wants Tollen to be busy and to feel slighted by Sembara so aid from Tollen is more grudging, etc
