# Discord DM – 2025-01-14

[2025-01-14 03:57 PM] rsulfuratus: finally got rid of all status/unknown tags
[2025-01-14 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: nice...
[2025-01-14 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: I'm looking at your Cleanup DM Info page and I wonder about dm_owner: none dm_notes: color
[2025-01-14 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: I used it a lot to mean: "I have no attachment or further plans for this person, but I haven't captured everything that came up in game around the person/place/etc"
[2025-01-14 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: ideally those would be prioritized for whoever has color notes to incorporate. i believe the intention is that indicates "i have some notes but don't feel any ownership of this page"
[2025-01-14 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: right, I guess that is the same as what I just said
[2025-01-14 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: I removed "player" from the DM_owner none list
[2025-01-14 04:27 PM] Deciusmus: I think PC pages should not show up on our "needs" work pages as they are instrictially somewhat stub-like
[2025-01-14 04:27 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-01-14 04:52 PM] rsulfuratus: what is the correct tagging for something like Yeraad River Basin? there is minimal canonical information but it is an obvious blank spot on the map with some brainstorming details. it doesn't feel like status/needswork is correct since we are trying to reserve that for notes that are incorrect in various ways. but it is not a stub either
[2025-01-14 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: this type of thing was what I had originally created "blankslate" or whatever for
[2025-01-14 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: but I think we decided no status is better
[2025-01-14 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure that is totally right
[2025-01-14 04:57 PM] rsulfuratus: what we really need is something like a script that identifies notes with either very high comment to real text ratios, or low text to backlink ratios
[2025-01-14 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: But why?
[2025-01-14 04:57 PM] rsulfuratus: to identify pages that either have lots of brainstorming to work on, or pages that are underdescribed for their importance
[2025-01-14 04:58 PM] rsulfuratus: but maybe it doesn't really matter
[2025-01-14 04:59 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't like a tag for this because i like having status tags be a clear indication of "there is something about this page you shouldn't trust"
[2025-01-14 04:59 PM] rsulfuratus: (in some cases it is just e.g. header information which isn't usually a big deal)
[2025-01-14 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: and the dm_notes / dm_owner does a great job of "page is correct, there is additional information"
[2025-01-14 05:00 PM] Deciusmus: I guess what I mean is...
    
    (a) we have a set of status/cleanup and related tags. This identifies pages that need fiddly cleanup. Useful as a "just go through and clean up" list, similar to say photo tagging or whatever. A sometimes fun way to waste 30 minutes between meetings or when you want to do something productive or whatever
    
    (b) dm_owner/dm_info which tracks stuff that has been made up or is active for a game, that isn't well captured in obsidian. that's stuff to write down for the purposes of running games mostly
    
    (c) status/needswork, status/stub and related - clear indicator that the page itself is not trustworthy, but its important enough that thing has been invented
[2025-01-14 05:00 PM] Deciusmus: The question is... 
    
    Do we need a way to identify "random actual worldbuilding unrelated to an ongoing game"
[2025-01-14 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: right, maybe not
[2025-01-14 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: In particular, pages with low text to backlink but no status or dm tags suggests "open areas" of the world that would be valuable to make up, in some sense
[2025-01-14 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: similarly, high comment to text ratio is stuff we are clearly interested in, but that no one has taken forward, probably because it isn't relevant to a game
[2025-01-14 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: I could kinda see the value of a "help wanted" type tag, for pages that seem empty compared to what they _should_ be but where the implication is that it is a good source of random invention
[2025-01-14 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, a place where random invention is fine, subject to all the normal discussions and such
[2025-01-14 05:04 PM] rsulfuratus: i think i'm now convinced our original approach was right after this brief discussion. we don't really need a tag for this kind of thing. i might do a little analysis out of curiosity, to e.g. find things that have tons of backlinks but very short pages (suggests places where i've done a bad job incorporating dm notes, perhaps), but from a tagging point of view it seems nicer to keep status tags and dm frontmatter clean
[2025-01-14 05:06 PM] Deciusmus: There are probably a lot of places in Sembara with high backlinks, low text as I invented a lot of names and tend to make people from those places, but don't actually have any of the places themselves made up
[2025-01-14 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: right, since you don't have transcripts and session notes in the same way it is harder for the sembara game. things that have lots of backlinks to session notes are what i was thinking.
[2025-01-14 05:07 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-01-14 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: things like rivers and small villages tend to get lots of cross links but don't show up in many session notes
[2025-01-14 05:07 PM] Deciusmus: Kiya has actually been writing session notes for each game, which is nice but I haven't been good about pulling them into obsidian and backlinking them
[2025-01-14 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: whereas candrosa is in 13 session notes but only has one sentence of (public) text
[2025-01-14 05:08 PM] rsulfuratus: so obviously incomplete
[2025-01-14 05:08 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-01-14 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: here is another one:
    
    # Incorporeal Gods
    
    `%%` tagging status/tim, status/mike as there are some decisions that probably should be made about the metaphysics of different types of gods. might need a better tag for "unclear cannon that needs to be decided" `%%`
    
    think we might need a different status tag for this, maybe status/needswork/shared?
[2025-01-14 05:19 PM] rsulfuratus: it isn't really a "status/check" case
[2025-01-14 05:19 PM] rsulfuratus: Kestavo has same issues
[2025-01-14 05:30 PM] rsulfuratus: this page, imo, should not have a status/needswork tag.

    `%%`% Needs info from my DM notes pulled in `%%`
[2025-01-14 05:30 PM] rsulfuratus: already indicates there is missing information due to dm_notes: color
[2025-01-14 06:19 PM] Deciusmus: A few comments:
    
    (a) something like status/needswork/decision or status/needswork/shared seems to correctly indicate the idea that there is some actual work to decide on what is canon. 
    
    (b) I like using status/check/mike, status/check/tim to indicate a page that appears in good shape but where someone wants to come back and review it as well as have the other one review.
[2025-01-14 06:19 PM] Deciusmus: for (b) if I took 30 minutes to go over the kestavo doc and move to `%%` the non-core bits and delete some old stuff, I might want to leave status/check/mike to remind myself to revisit after I had let it sit for a day
[2025-01-14 06:20 PM] Deciusmus: but also I agree that status/check should not be used on pages where the ask is to read it and rewrite sections; it means the common action is to remove status/check only
[2025-01-14 06:20 PM] Deciusmus: so the current kestavo page is probably something else
[2025-01-14 06:21 PM] Deciusmus: I think the incorporeal god page is probably reasonable as status/check/mike status/check/tim as the bare text not in `%%` is actually fine and introduces no need for decisions about canon.
[2025-01-14 06:23 PM] Deciusmus: I would go back to the basic idea, which is that we are not trying to use status tags to capture all the work we COULD do, just the state of the page.
[2025-01-14 06:37 PM] Deciusmus: On Alaric wanted to have at least a sentence or two about him before marking as complete
[2025-01-14 06:47 PM] rsulfuratus: so in that case I think the correct status tag is status/stub? which means "incomplete" for any definition of incomplete. my aim is to have status/needswork exclusively refer to pages where there is something wrong or non-canon about the text itself
[2025-01-14 06:49 PM] Deciusmus: Ah fair
[2025-01-14 06:49 PM] Deciusmus: Good point
[2025-01-14 06:52 PM] rsulfuratus: basically my goal is:
    - status/update, status/stub = page is incomplete, either because it was never finished or because events have proceeded
    - status/cleanup = someone wants to rewrite or thinks the page needs a rewrite
    - status/metadata = header, image, etc work
    - status/check =  review, not rewrite
    
    with trying to keep status/needswork to a handful of pages that really need work because they are misleading. ideally there would be nothing in status/needswork
[2025-01-14 06:55 PM] rsulfuratus: this is a bit of a change from how we've treated status/stub before, which was "needs a header" so we could have a status/wip or something to distinguish true stubs from "not enough information for author to consider finished"
[2025-01-14 06:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i just want status/needswork to be cleanly the pages with bad/misleading information only
[2025-01-14 07:26 PM] rsulfuratus: I think: 'status/cleanup/internal' is the most useful status tag for this (Alesh):
    
    `%%` needs work: lots of information about chronology, travels, and party contact scattered throughout session notes, that needs to be incorporated and cleaned up `%%`
