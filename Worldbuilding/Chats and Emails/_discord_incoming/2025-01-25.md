# Discord DM – 2025-01-25

[2025-01-25 09:58 AM] rsulfuratus: poked around at the gazetteer reorg. i didn't make any edits as i don't want to get sucked into another taelgar project until i'm done with my multiverse rework, but i like the basic organization and framing. i don't know if it is easier to keep working in a branch for a bit until at least the basic framework for each region page is committed, but i'm fine either way
[2025-01-25 09:58 AM] rsulfuratus: i like the basic style of the geography of taelgar page, can always fiddle around a bit but the basic idea is great and i think it highlights the right things
[2025-01-25 09:59 AM] rsulfuratus: the one thing i might add is a "beyond the known world, rumors of..." section
[2025-01-25 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus: on the region pages:
    - the basic framework of the North Sentinels page seems great: major features, civiliations and cultures, history, and climate seem like the main useful headings we'll want
    - in previous region pages, i often included a lot of "what this place is like in the real world" detail. i think this belongs in dm notes, not player facing, but might want to have multiple campaign none blocks. the central highlands page has a lot of the kind of detail i find useful, but not organized well
[2025-01-25 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus: i think the exact heading and organization can vary - for greater dunmar where there is a lot of geographic detail, might have a terrain heading; for sembara, the civilations and cultures might need to be expanded or reorganized somehow
[2025-01-25 10:05 AM] rsulfuratus: i do think we should aim to keep the region pages to 1-2 paragraphs of text per subhead at most, and link out of broader descriptions if needed. e.g. for greater dunmar it would not be unreasonable to have a "geography of greater dunmar" page itself. the `*`See more: [[link]]* works pretty well i think when there is more detail than can be captured in 1-2 paragraphs
[2025-01-25 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: All makes sense. I’m out with Dana and Z right now but have some time this afternoon I will probably work on this a bit (although I have a little bit of session prep for my game tomorrow as well)
[2025-01-25 11:02 AM] Deciusmus: My main goal is to finish moving pages around, check and cleanup whereabouts that are wrong or broken, and make a basic landing page with each region, that has at least a map, the high level headings, and a sentence or two under each heading. This morning I got pretty far on a food greater sembara page
[2025-01-25 11:02 AM] Deciusmus: But I don’t think I’m going to try to write good pages for all the regions, just basic stuff
[2025-01-25 11:02 AM] Deciusmus: At which point probably makes sense to merge
[2025-01-25 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah, agreed. i think writing good pages for everything will take some time
[2025-01-25 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus: i have some ideas to clean up the maps a bit, but won't mess around with that for a while and it is helpful to have the basic maps in there immediately
[2025-01-25 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: what do you think of this:
    
    ## Civilizations and Cultures
    _See more: [[Sembara]], [[Tyrwingha]], [[Addermarch]], [[Tollen]], [[Vostok]], [[Zimkova]], [[Duchy of Maseau]]_
    
    This is a heavily peopled land. In the north, amongst the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], the [[Zimka]] people live a traditional life in the highlands of [[Zimkova]], and have formed three realms: [[Breva]], [[Lavnoch]], and [[Ardlas]]. South and east of the Zimkovan realms is [[Sembara]], a rich and powerful monarchy with a long history. Sembara is bordered to its south by the ancient fey-protected realm of [[Tyrwingha]], as well as the independent earldom of [[Addermarch]] and the [[Duchy of Maseau]], once under the suzeranity of Sembara, but now an independent land populated by refugees from the [[Isingue]] and the [[Plaguelands]]. To the east is the famous [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]] and past Tollen, the lightly populated coasts and forests of [[Vostok]].
    
    There are two large and ancient lizardfolk settlements: [[Ozabal]], in the delta of the [[Wistel]], and [[Latazaro]], on the eastern borders of [[Tyrwingha]]. Beyond these settlements, lizardfolk are common along the river valleys. There are three major [[Dwarves|dwarven]] realms on the western borders, and dwarves are common in the human cities of Sembara, although there are no large, independent dwarven realms within Greater Sembara. Halflings are commonly seen plying their trade along the roads and rivers of the region, as well sailing across the [[Western Gulf]] and into the wider [[Green Sea]]. Although [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]] are never common, they too are seen in the cities of Sembara, although, like dwarves, there are no large stoneborn communities within the region.
[2025-01-25 01:06 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a slightly updated structure for the Greater Sembara page, which I think is a good general structure for these main region pages. Let me know what you think, if you get a chance to look at it
[2025-01-25 01:25 PM] rsulfuratus: i like the greater sembara page a lot
[2025-01-25 01:25 PM] rsulfuratus: obviously needs a bit of filling in, and such, but the basic structure feels very cohesive
[2025-01-25 01:26 PM] Deciusmus: do you have any sense what the geographic of central vostok is like?
[2025-01-25 01:27 PM] rsulfuratus: not really
[2025-01-25 01:28 PM] Deciusmus: i'm envisioning everything inside the yellow as "highlands"
![[../_discord_assets/image-7B63E.png]]
[2025-01-25 01:29 PM] Deciusmus: which nicely separates Tollen from Vostok except by sea
[2025-01-25 01:29 PM] rsulfuratus: the river patterns imply roughly that, yes
[2025-01-25 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: the hills east/south east of tollen should probably extend up the volta a bit. at one point this was thought to be source of metal for the tollen mint
[2025-01-25 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: but not sure if that is canonical
[2025-01-25 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: and I'm envisioning the "P" area to be a moderately high plateau (not Tibet or anything like that, but still 2000-4000 ft)
![[../_discord_assets/image-DF58E.png]]
[2025-01-25 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: but the ? I don't have a clear sense of
[2025-01-25 01:33 PM] rsulfuratus: probably in general it should be forest
[2025-01-25 01:33 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the region north of the wall is only not forest because it is too dry
[2025-01-25 01:34 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it is not really far enough north for tundra
[2025-01-25 01:35 PM] Deciusmus: right, I mean, the map has it as forest. right now I'm just trying to finish the "topography and major features" section of the greater sembara page
[2025-01-25 01:35 PM] Deciusmus: is it relatively low/flat, or is it hilly?
[2025-01-25 01:35 PM] rsulfuratus: actually something like this is maybe a good model: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_forest_steppe
[2025-01-25 01:36 PM] rsulfuratus: i think for topography, the area around the word "Vostok" is lowlands
[2025-01-25 01:36 PM] rsulfuratus: (ish)
[2025-01-25 01:36 PM] rsulfuratus: and the vostok coast is fairly flat until you get to near the mountains
[2025-01-25 01:37 PM] rsulfuratus: something like the saint lawerence gulf coast of canada
[2025-01-25 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/sembara-region-map-CE7B0.png]]
[2025-01-25 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: the dark blue are highlands, with the plateau with the lake maybe kind of like lake yellowston
[2025-01-25 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: river valleys slope down towards the coast in light blue
[2025-01-25 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: with light blue circle coastal lowlands
[2025-01-25 01:41 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I think that makes sense
[2025-01-25 01:42 PM] rsulfuratus: this fits with the cultural history description of the northwest corner of vostok really being part of zimkova
[2025-01-25 01:42 PM] Deciusmus: where perhaps a northern forest/taiga/interior maine type climate gives way to your kazakh forest steppe as the elevation gets higher and drier
[2025-01-25 01:43 PM] rsulfuratus: right, since most of the moisture comes from the green sea by the time you get to 4000 feet it is cold and dry
[2025-01-25 01:43 PM] rsulfuratus: not obvious on the map but i think the idea would be that the lowland rivers have many unmapped tributaries but the "lake yellowstone" area does not
[2025-01-25 01:57 PM] Deciusmus: ok so something like this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-0873C.png]]
[2025-01-25 01:59 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-01-25 02:05 PM] Deciusmus: where pink = highlands, blue = lowlands, 
    #1 - "Zimkova foothills" - hilly "highland" terrain, mostly forested, many rivers and lakes that are not on the map, plus the big ones that are. Zimka culture
    #2  - "Vostok High Plateau" - yellostone-esque, blank culturally (but lightly peopled)
    #3 - Mostreve Hills
    #4 - main Sembaran lowland
    #5 = Maseau Plains (distinct and drier than main lowland, bit of Mostreve Hills rain shadow/less moisture from Green Sea)
    #6 = "Vostok lowlands" (eastern Canada) with the green lines rising up to the hills
    #7 - undefined Tollen highlands, separates tollen from Vostok, probably a blank slate for right now but no people really
    #8 = coastal highlands, also likely undefined and probably Skaer
[2025-01-25 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: 6 is basically the "Kem Watershed"; 4 is the "Semb/Wistel/Volta watersheds"
[2025-01-25 03:28 PM] Deciusmus: I have to go shopping or we wont have any food to make for dinner
[2025-01-25 03:28 PM] Deciusmus: but I pushed an update
[2025-01-25 03:29 PM] Deciusmus: with
    (a) a mostly done Greater Sembara and Far North pages
    (b) a worklist for everything that needs doing
    (c) started North Sentinels page
[2025-01-25 03:29 PM] Deciusmus: btw can you bring the maple syrup and camera when you come over
[2025-01-25 03:29 PM] rsulfuratus: yes planning on it
