[2025-01-06 10:32 PM] rsulfuratus: kate and i talked for a while about Riswynn and the crown. basically she is happy for Riswynn to take the crown if it seems like it makes sense from either meta or in-game perspective (and I kind of like the worldbuilding implications of the free-more-orcs quest), and it would be a satisfying character arc for riswynn in a lot of ways - but as kate put it, riswynn cares a lot more about the orcs than kate does. and kate doesn't have a particularly strong desire to make a new character (she would probably just make a new cleric anyway).
[2025-01-06 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus: so the upshot is, i think, that if you end up thinking about it some more and feel like you really want delwath's character arc to end with taking the crown, or if you are excited about a new character, you should take priority for claiming the crown
[2025-01-06 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus: but alternatively if delwath just wants someone to use it and the only quest everyone can agree on is 'free the orcs' kate is happy for riswynn to take that on
[2025-01-06 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus: a minor advantage of introducing a new character now to replace delwath might be using that character's backstory to better set up / add context to the isingue / plaguelands final arc that is intended to end the campaign
[2025-01-06 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus: (although that might steer too close to beryl-related things which you might want to avoid)
[2025-01-06 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway, no rush to reply as i'm sure you are busy with bar mitzvah stuff as well but would be good to get some thoughts before next tuesday
