[2024-09-16 08:24 PM] rsulfuratus: is there anything canonical about when Umbreath established Duskmire? in the Duskmire note you have in the 600s but is that set in stone? 
    
    i'm dropping a warning stone in the next adventure for my Addermarch campaign that is near a place of easy travel (not quite a portal, but a place where fey can cross to the material plane with less effort)
[2024-09-16 08:24 PM] rsulfuratus: trying to figure out what language the warning signs might be in
[2024-09-16 08:24 PM] Deciusmus: Nothing canonical.
[2024-09-16 08:25 PM] Deciusmus: But it has to be before Cloudspinner was imprisoned
[2024-09-16 08:26 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i was more wondering about pushing it back a bit. 600s would be when Drankor had already established in Addermarch
[2024-09-16 08:26 PM] rsulfuratus: say to 200 or 300
[2024-09-16 08:26 PM] Deciusmus: For the expansion narrative to work. Could be much older though. Who knows how long Umbraeth was hanging out in the Darkwood
[2024-09-16 08:26 PM] rsulfuratus: so by the time Drankorians arrive, the Ethlenn/Umbaeth split has already happened
[2024-09-16 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that probably works
[2024-09-16 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realm in the Cleenseau folder has a few hints
[2024-09-16 08:29 PM] rsulfuratus: will take a look
[2024-09-16 08:30 PM] Deciusmus: But something like 250-300 would work fine.
[2024-09-16 08:30 PM] Deciusmus: I think
[2024-09-16 08:31 PM] rsulfuratus: on a totally separate D&D topic - I realized recently when talking to Isaac that Epic Boons just have a character level 19 requirement, so you can technically take them at any level that gives you a feat as long as you are character level 19. 
    
    so theoretically if Delwath were willing to give up 9th level spells, you could take an epic boon at both warlock 16/sorcerer 3, and warlock 16/sorcerer 4
[2024-09-16 08:31 PM] rsulfuratus: (which would also give you 22 Cha)
[2024-09-16 08:33 PM] Deciusmus: Also means giving up a 4th pact magic slot
[2024-09-16 08:33 PM] rsulfuratus: ah that's true. that might be worth more than the 1/day 9th level spell
[2024-09-16 08:56 PM] Deciusmus: I mean it will be a while. Would take sor 4 before level 20 anyway. So can wait and see
[2024-09-16 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: true
