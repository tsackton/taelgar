# Discord DM – 2024-09-13

[2024-09-13 09:39 AM] Deciusmus: I was messing around with a D&D 2024 version of Delwath a bit... D&D Beyond is tough to use as I can't select old-school invocations like Ghostly Gaze
[2024-09-13 09:51 AM] Deciusmus: But... broadly, I'd be tempted (assuming I do this when going to level 12 warlock)
    (a) rearrange stats slightly to drop WIS to 10
    (b) which lets me boost starting CHA to 17
    (c) which means I can get to 20 via ASI @ 4th and War Caster @ 8th (which now gives a +1 to CHA)
    (d) which means my 8 invocations are:
    - Pact of the Blade
    - Thirsting + Devouring Blade
    - Ghostly Gaze
    - Eye of the Rune Keeper (so weak they removed it, but important for flavor)
    - 3 others TBD
    
    That drops Eldritch Mind (which is replaced with War Caster) and Improved Pact Weapon (which I might add back in)
[2024-09-13 09:57 AM] Deciusmus: Ideas:
    Ascendant Step (Levitate @ will)
    Devil's Sight
    Master of Myriad Forms
    Visions of Distant Realms
    Lifedrinker (but I don't really like the flavor)
[2024-09-13 09:58 AM] Deciusmus: or adding back in Improved Pact Weapon, although mechanically it kinda boring in that it is just effectively a +1 to hit/damage
[2024-09-13 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus: there is a lot that is still a little buggy about the 2024 D&D Beyond implementation, but hopefully a lot of these will be fixed by the time it officially releases on 9/17 (so before Colorado)
[2024-09-13 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus: (e.g. selecting older invocations)
[2024-09-13 11:03 AM] Deciusmus: yeah less worried about the actual implementation than just playing around with possibilities
[2024-09-13 11:04 AM] Deciusmus: I assume you'd have no objection to tweaking stats (the fact that War Caster gives +1 CHA now makes it a lot more compelling than Eldritch Mind)
[2024-09-13 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah, that's fine
[2024-09-13 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: are you planning on taking metamagic adept at 12?
[2024-09-13 11:04 AM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-09-13 11:05 AM] Deciusmus: 4th level is ASI, 8th War Caster, 12th Metamagic Adept
[2024-09-13 11:05 AM] Deciusmus: nets a +3 CHA, so then tweak starting stats to have 17 CHA (15 from point buy + 2 from background) to keep CHA 20 @ 8th level
[2024-09-13 11:05 AM] Deciusmus: but that means dropping WIS or INT to 10 from 12
[2024-09-13 11:06 AM] Deciusmus: then the main changes would be:
    * Origin Feat (not thought about it yet)
    * between 2 and 4 invocations
[2024-09-13 11:07 AM] Deciusmus: (where 2 would be if I kept Improved Pact Weapon + Eye of Rune Keeper; 4 would be if I replaced Eye of Rune Keeper with Comprehend Languages and also dropped Improved Pact Weapon)
[2024-09-13 11:08 AM] Deciusmus: I think spells are the same (other than being able to change Green Flame Blade to something actually useful, although I *almost* used it against the minions in the battle with the vine)
[2024-09-13 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus: I would argue you should keep Eye of the Rune Keeper for story reasons, but dropping Improved Pact Weapon certainly makes sense if there is something more interesting
[2024-09-13 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus: Delwath has been using Alter Self a lot, so Master of Myriad Forms might be a thematic and useful choice
[2024-09-13 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus: that would also free up a spell known
[2024-09-13 11:11 AM] Deciusmus: Would you consider an upgrade to Eye of the Rune Keeper to be
    
    Senses of the Rune Keeper
    You can understand the literal meaning of any language you hear or see signed, and the literal meaning of any writing you see.
[2024-09-13 11:13 AM] Deciusmus: (Basically Comprehend Language @ will, without the limit of "touching the writing"
[2024-09-13 11:14 AM] Deciusmus: Given most invocations are non-ritual spells at will, it doesn't seem overpowered
[2024-09-13 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus: (on a meeting, more later)
[2024-09-13 11:18 AM] Deciusmus: I think I'd be tempted by Ascendant Step (basically to save on Fly casting for simple things like drifting to the ground from Vdrinjashra or not having to climb) and Master of Myriad Forms.
    
    Then still need to think about Improved Pact Weapon
[2024-09-13 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus: okay a few thoughts:
    
    (1) On Rune Keeper: for Delwath, I don't think it really matters at all one way or the other, since of course the situations where (a) you want to understand what someone is saying, and (b) you can't spare a spell slot to cast Tongues are exceedingly rare, and anyway Kenzo can already understand all languages. 
    But, in general, I'm not a big fan of "understand all language all the time" as a invocation, it feels like it really cuts off a good chunk of using language as a meaningful mechanical barrier. I'm actually not a fan of the decision in the new PHB to just collapse everything into "just Ritual cast it", e.g. I think that the Beast Speech and the Eldritch Sight invocations are interesting and still useful.
[2024-09-13 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus: (2) On other invocations: completely fine with any of those choices.
[2024-09-13 12:39 PM] Deciusmus: On Eyes of the Rune Keeper, mostly it is just substantially weaker than Comprehend Languages. So in many ways I'm not sure it is really interesting given Comprehend Languages is very easy to get
[2024-09-13 12:40 PM] Deciusmus: (and there is a bit of a "keeping up with the jones" effect for Delwath specifically, where it feels odd that as the one with massive Charisma / party face role he is substantially behind Kenzo in the "understand what you are saying" department)
[2024-09-13 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus: well, that depends on whether the 'takes 10 minutes to cast' and 'have to touch writing' are meaningful or not
[2024-09-13 12:41 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, from a invocation standpoint, an invocation that lets you cast a first level spell at will is pretty standard
[2024-09-13 12:41 PM] Deciusmus: so it isn't even ritual cast, so much as just "cast without a spell slot"
[2024-09-13 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus: from the point of view of delwath, as I said, I don't think it really matters
[2024-09-13 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm just not convinced from a game design perspective that having a low-level invocation that lets you understand all spoken and writing language at will is something i would want to homebrew
[2024-09-13 12:43 PM] Deciusmus: From a balance standpoint, if I were designing an invocation that let you cast a 1st level spell, that was already a ritual, at will, I'd make it a little better than the spell is my only point.
[2024-09-13 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus: as it trivializes language choice
[2024-09-13 12:43 PM] Deciusmus: Isn't language choice already trivialized by the existence of Comprehend Languages at some level?
[2024-09-13 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: There are a bunch of other ways to "trivialize" language choice, i.e. Magic Initiate or Ritual Caster, they all require choosing to do so
[2024-09-13 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus: a little, but to me it feels different to have an ability that says "you just understand everything" as opposed to having a spell you can cast
[2024-09-13 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus: to me, ritual casting Comprehend Languages is rarely, if ever, useful for the spoken word part
[2024-09-13 12:45 PM] Deciusmus: I guess. I think the game effect of the difference is fairly minimal.
[2024-09-13 12:46 PM] Deciusmus: Really? There are lots of situations where you know you are going into a social situation and in most games taking 10 min to ritual cast before you do is pretty easy to do
[2024-09-13 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. the main circumstance you'd want to understand language but not speak it is when you are eavesdropping or similar, and typically you wouldn't have 10 minutes to ritual cast
[2024-09-13 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus: but comprehend doesn't let you speak, just understand
[2024-09-13 12:46 PM] Deciusmus: sure, but that is still useful in any social situation, i.e. where the other people might talk in their own language
[2024-09-13 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: I think D&D already has a mechanical issue with languages because they are binary
[2024-09-13 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess it is just my dmign style, i can't think of a time i've had npcs have a side conversation in a different language, but i do sometimes have enemies yell to each in other in combat
[2024-09-13 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`side conversation during a social situation
[2024-09-13 12:48 PM] Deciusmus: The giants
[2024-09-13 12:48 PM] Deciusmus: but Delwath had already cast tongues
[2024-09-13 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-09-13 12:49 PM] Deciusmus: Plus some stuff in Ursk where casting a spell wasn't possible
[2024-09-13 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus: in any case, i don't think it matter for delwath and it is perfectly reasonable for delwath to just understand all languages
[2024-09-13 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: Scrying is another scenario
[2024-09-13 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus: right but when you are scrying there is basically no situation in which you can't just cast tongues
[2024-09-13 12:51 PM] Deciusmus: Its a big tax on slots to have to cast tongues
[2024-09-13 12:51 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, realistically, I guess it rarely matters. But I'm always nervous to burn 2 slots in that type of situation
[2024-09-13 12:52 PM] Deciusmus: (and back when I only had 2 slots and was spamming scrys, a ritual comprehend is much better use of time than scry + tongues)
[2024-09-13 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: My point is actually just a philosophical one, which is that from a pure in world usefulness perspective, I don't really think "read all writing without touching it" necessarily would win over "cast comprehend languages as written as a ritual"
[2024-09-13 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus: i think what i would actually do if I were homebrewing this from first principles is leave eyes of the rune keeper as a 2+ level invocation, and then make a new higher level invocation that is you can understand all spoken or written language
[2024-09-13 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: See from a pure homebrew balance perspective I think it doesn't work once warlocks have access to ritual spells
[2024-09-13 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus: perhaps you'd make eyes of the rune keeper be: "You always have the Comprehend Languages spell prepared. In addition, you can read all writing/"
[2024-09-13 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: That is closer to balanced
[2024-09-13 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe not worth taking? i'm not sure. i mean, delwath took eyes of the rune keeper a while ago and i think got a fair bit of value out of it
[2024-09-13 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: of course 2024 warlocks couldn't ritual cast and had much more limited slots...
[2024-09-13 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: Right, but Delwath had no option to take Comprehend Languages
[2024-09-13 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: and no option to ritual cast
[2024-09-13 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`2014 warlocks
[2024-09-13 12:56 PM] Deciusmus: If I could have just learned Comprehend Language as a spell and been able to ritual cast? I'm not sure Eyes of the Rune Keeper is worth it over some other invocation
[2024-09-13 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: For example, if it was a choice between Comprehend Languages as a known spel + Alter Self at will, vs Alter Self as a known spell + Eyes of the Rune Keeper it isn't even a close decision
[2024-09-13 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus: sure. i mean in 2014 alter self at will was 15+ level. there is a lot of power creep in the 2024 warlock, more than many other classes
[2024-09-13 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus: which i have mixed feelings about because I think some of the lower-power invocations mechanically are very flavorful (also see the doesn't need to sleep one), but the more powerful invocations become the more feel-bad it is to take those
[2024-09-13 01:04 PM] rsulfuratus: what would be more flavorful imo is scaling invocations, or at least "low level" and "high level" versions. e.g., at 3rd level or whatever, "read all writing" isn't necessarily a bad choice. by 5th level, you probably want it to be stronger, and by 12th level definitely. 
    
    but you could do something like:
    (no level req): read all writing
    (requires 5th level): understand all written, spoken, signed language
    (requiress 11th level): understand all written, spoken, signed language. cast tongues at will. 
    (requires 17th level): understand and speak any written, spoken, signed language. you can use spell scrolls of any class.
[2024-09-13 01:07 PM] rsulfuratus: in any case, not sure any of this really matters for delwath specifically, who i think should just get a homebrew invocation
[2024-09-13 01:07 PM] Deciusmus: sure, although if you are offering up "cast tongues at will" for I wouldn't say no
