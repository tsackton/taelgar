# Discord DM – 2025-01-02

[2025-01-02 03:40 PM] rsulfuratus: working out some possible endings for the whole Dunmar/Chardon war, Kenzo's attempts to provoke unrest in the chalyte trade, and the rump part of the Cleansed. while some things are up in the air based on what your party does, especially w/r/t the Crown, some things are probably in motion already and could potentially result in major upheavals to the political landscape of Dunmar and the Chardonian Empire. curious how much you care about the outcomes here. this is obviously significantly later than your campaign, and far away, so might never matter.
[2025-01-02 04:05 PM] Deciusmus: from my game perspective, doesn't matter. Even with some time skips my game will never get to the 1740s and also I have no real plans to ever have the game in Chardon or Dunmar.
[2025-01-02 04:06 PM] Deciusmus: from a pure worldbuilding perspective, and the idea of some kind of canonical 1750s Taelgar, I care a bit although I've always considered myself more of an observer on everything west of the Sentinals
[2025-01-02 04:06 PM] Deciusmus: I was considering having Delwath make a play to take and keep the crown as a way of bringing peace and an end to war
[2025-01-02 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: It would obviously get complex and maybe require making a new 17th level character....
[2025-01-02 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: But he was really interested in the idea that the crown could end wars
[2025-01-02 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: or at least, some wars
[2025-01-02 04:08 PM] rsulfuratus: i am very happy with the crown as an artifact
[2025-01-02 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: yeah its really cool
[2025-01-02 04:08 PM] rsulfuratus: potentially there would be a time skip after the final battle tonight so there could be plenty of options for new characters, changing things up, etc
[2025-01-02 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: So I am really unsure, and obviously I like Delwath, and also don't want to disrupt the party or have Delwath become a villian that Wellby or anyone else feels compelled to hunt down
[2025-01-02 04:10 PM] Deciusmus: But it would be very in character for him, I think, to want to bring peace and a final end to the Great War
[2025-01-02 04:12 PM] Deciusmus: I could totally see him taking the crown and saying goodbye to the party in some fashion. Conceptually if he wanted to become a villian, he could pretty easily, it would be very hard for the party to find him if he plane shifted somewhere immediately after grabbing the crown. But I definitely don't want Delwath to end up a villian (although hunting him down and ending the scourge of the crown would be a cool arc)
[2025-01-02 04:13 PM] rsulfuratus: the idea behind the crown is supposed to be pretty clear that it doesn't force you to become a villain. it is dangerous - very dangerous in the wrong hands - but it would not force delwath to become evil
[2025-01-02 04:13 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I know
[2025-01-02 04:14 PM] Deciusmus: But of course he has a lot of pain in his backstory - if I wanted (which I don't) - his arc to be one of fall from grace the crown would be the kind of artifact that might encourage that...
[2025-01-02 04:14 PM] Deciusmus: in the sense of power corrupts, not in the sense of the crown itself corrupts
[2025-01-02 04:14 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-01-02 04:14 PM] Deciusmus: But that doesn't work for me
[2025-01-02 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: But the idea of delwath the peacemaker running off with the crown is a little bit appealing
[2025-01-02 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: if you want to go for that after the apollyon fight, from a meta perspective it would totally work and it would be easy to work in a new character in the gap between tonight and the next arc
[2025-01-02 04:18 PM] Deciusmus: I could even play in his death, actually (which to be honest was a little bit unsatisfying, it might have played better in reaction to something, it felt a bit anticlimatic... but anyway)...
    
    I could imagine Delwath coming back from the dead with a new perspective - a broader one
[2025-01-02 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: less "my companions" and more "all people"
[2025-01-02 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: sorta pernonar esque
[2025-01-02 04:19 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, that could be good
[2025-01-02 04:20 PM] rsulfuratus: i think i was trying to manage too many things and was too subtle about delwath's death - it was supposed to be more clear that apollyon absolutely hates elves
[2025-01-02 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, that kinda got lost
[2025-01-02 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: but makes sense in retrospect
[2025-01-02 04:25 PM] Deciusmus: Does it make sense from a worldbuilding perspective to basically have Delwath succeeed at bringing peace, at least as far as Chardonioan Empire and its expansion and Dunmar is concerned?
    
    I think Delwath would see "peace" as a checked Chardonian Empire, satisfied with is territory, and not expansionist, and likely/perhaps a growing place of friendship with elves?
[2025-01-02 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: Assuming the end of the campaign is freeing Isingue from the acid monster, that would setup the 1750s to be really quite peaceful and golden-ageish?
    
    It wouldn't be satisfying for Delwath to run off with the crown and then ultimately fail
[2025-01-02 04:30 PM] rsulfuratus: there are a few possible strands here from a worldbuliding perspective.
    
    i am definitely expected some of the Cleansed to survive, either as an underground cult or the power behind a puppet/client state, worshipping a cult of Apollyon. 
    
    i think the Chardonian Empire as designed is too big and makes the west feel a bit boring, so there is a good chance that there is some internal fragmentation. exactly how is unclear and tbd but, e.g., if Chardon turns against the chaltyte trade you could have Voltara in the north break away (rebelling against new Chalyte Control Laws) or something. 
    
    i think if Delwath ran off with the crown, it would be very reasonable for success to look like a smaller Chardonian Empire, renewed peace with the elves and Dunmar, but likely still conflict in the north with the mercantilist oligarchs of voltara and the remnants of the cult of Apollyon
[2025-01-02 04:31 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. if Chardon turned away from expansionist tendancies in the east, you could have peace with the Deno'qai of the Elderwood and reestablished ties with elves who might return to some of the forests north of the Elderwood
[2025-01-02 04:31 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that makes sense
[2025-01-02 04:32 PM] Deciusmus: I might sound out everyone else at the beginning of the session - don’t want to do it if Wellby or Kenzo would feel compelled to hunt Delwath down and take the crown back by force or something
[2025-01-02 08:14 PM] Deciusmus: So what is the next arc? Part of the question here is could I come up with a good Delwath alternative... I guess it shouldn't be that hard?
[2025-01-02 08:15 PM] Deciusmus: It is I guess possible you are not even sure
[2025-01-02 08:15 PM] Deciusmus: I can't decide if it is unsatisfying to not end with the same character
[2025-01-02 08:16 PM] rsulfuratus: I am not sure - but my hope was to finish the Frankar arc before Eric's second kid is born, so that would potentially be the next arc
[2025-01-02 08:17 PM] rsulfuratus: other than Frankar and the final Isingue arc, I don't have a lot of plans yet, so it is a bit up in the air. but from a metagame perspective it makes more sense to go straight to Frankar
[2025-01-02 08:17 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-01-02 08:18 PM] rsulfuratus: Frankar would be a super easy arc to introduce a new character for
[2025-01-02 08:18 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2025-01-02 08:19 PM] rsulfuratus: but I think it would be pretty easy no matter what. e.g., if everyone decides to go disrupt the Chardon chalyte trade, then Wazir could jsut level up a lot for example
[2025-01-02 08:20 PM] rsulfuratus: I wouldn't let "introduce a new character" stop you if you want to go this route with Delwath. this is the easiest possible point in a long campaign to introduce a new character, imo
[2025-01-02 08:21 PM] Deciusmus: I'm really leaning towards this honestly.
[2025-01-02 08:21 PM] Deciusmus: I kinda want to make sure everyone else is ok though... like to some extent need their cooperation to not stop delwath
[2025-01-02 08:22 PM] rsulfuratus: I think you can wait until after Apollyon imo
[2025-01-02 08:22 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2025-01-02 11:55 PM] Deciusmus: Did you already know the source of the crown or did you just make this up? awesome either way
