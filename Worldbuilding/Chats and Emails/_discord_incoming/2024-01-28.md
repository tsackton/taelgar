# Discord DM – 2024-01-28

[2024-01-28 06:08 PM] rsulfuratus: looking at various status/tim things. 
    
    on Avatus: don't have strong feelings human vs hobgoblin; feel free to choose, or he could be something else entirely. 
    
    I think the exact history of where this dominion came from can probably be left a bit unclear. 
    
    I do think the vibe kind of suggests that in the aftermath of the fall of Drankor, Sembara is a bit of a backwater, initially. Especially once the Dunmari arrive in late 1100s and clear up the lingering curse, you have a pretty powerful set of realms from Cymea - Isingue - Dunmar - Chardon. 
    
    The Skaer in a more raiding phase, and the Dominion of Avatus, really kind of hem in Sembara pre-Derik I.
[2024-01-28 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: Yes; definitely think his dominion origination unclear for now; I do think the breakup of a fairly large autocracy is a good way to expand Sembara without "conqueoring" in the usual sense, so I like Avatus stretching basically from the mountains to Tyrwingha
[2024-01-28 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: and Maseau/Addermarch/western Sembara comes from the collapse
[2024-01-28 06:14 PM] rsulfuratus: so it does play a bit into the human/hobgoblin/other decision, to think a bit about whether the reconquest is liberating basically still intact populated areas that were ruled by Avatus, or resettling depopulated areas?
[2024-01-28 06:14 PM] rsulfuratus: of course viable to have either option for human or hobgoblin or something else
[2024-01-28 06:15 PM] rsulfuratus: i might actually be inclined to make Avatus a bit more unique/powerful in his own right than just human/hobgoblin, but without making him fantastic enough that it feels weird his unusual nature hasn't come up
[2024-01-28 06:16 PM] Deciusmus: I'm inclined to leave his exact nature somewhat undefined. He clearly has hobgoblins working for him, but I think he had motivations that were not exactly just pure destruction and murder
[2024-01-28 06:17 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, that seems right
[2024-01-28 06:18 PM] Deciusmus: At the same time, I think violence depopulates a place pretty rapidly.  So for practical purposes, I think a Maseau, for example, ends up being a "new" place after Avatus. If the deep history of Maseau ever matters, it probably isn't the case that there were literally no humans then when Avatus was defeated. But at the same time, the political structures were imposed by Derik I as part of the foundation of Sembara
[2024-01-28 06:19 PM] Deciusmus: imposed is probably the wrong word - received gracefully. And then it became a land of a lot of new settlement
[2024-01-28 06:19 PM] Deciusmus: So by the time of the Great War, Maseau and the other "new" duchies in Sembara are pretty Sembaran.
[2024-01-28 06:20 PM] Deciusmus: But also, I guess, pretty Sembaran only in the sense of loyal to the House of Sewick
[2024-01-28 06:21 PM] Deciusmus: so when things start to fall apart after the Great War, there is a distinct sense of place for Maseau
[2024-01-28 06:22 PM] rsulfuratus: I mean it depends a bit on Avatus' motives. if he needs agricultural productivity, he is going to reign in his armies and make sure they don't massacre the peasants
[2024-01-28 06:22 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, people will still flee
[2024-01-28 06:23 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway, not sure it matters too much
[2024-01-28 06:24 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I think what I'm actually trying to say is that whatever political entity did or did not exist pre-Avatus is functionally irrelevant post-Avatus. Maseau and other parts of western/borderland Sembara probably are generic "Sembaran/Drankorian" types, with fewer than usual Zimka/kestavo influences with a somewhat irrevelvant pre-Avatus history
[2024-01-28 06:24 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, agreed
[2024-01-28 06:24 PM] Deciusmus: I do think there is probably some sense of culture/people that is distinct from the heartland duchies
[2024-01-28 06:25 PM] Deciusmus: And so Derik I basically creates a new Duchy of Maseau where the duke is loyal to Sewick and declares a bunch of the land part of the royal demense and then leaves the Duke to run the place similar to how the dukes run the heartland duchies
[2024-01-28 06:25 PM] rsulfuratus: the main semi-canon effects of Avatus are whatever you've introduced in your campaign, and the idea that the edge of the Sentinels west of Isingue remains something of a wildlands, a place where hobgoblins and other nasty things linger. you have e.g. Revaka three generations later, and then the various hobgoblin attacks / armies in the high school campaign
[2024-01-28 06:26 PM] rsulfuratus: so Avatus is kind of a useful placeholder there - defeated, but not every bit of his army wiped from the earth
[2024-01-28 06:26 PM] rsulfuratus: but yes I agree that the pre-Avatus political structures become irrelevant post-Avatus
[2024-01-28 06:27 PM] Deciusmus: I imagine somewhat of a gradient, the upper Isatoros watershed is probably still pretty dangerous until post-Great War, when the shifting plaguelands prevent travel from going south via Isingue
[2024-01-28 06:27 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. in 1500 you'd have a major trade route running via Urlich Pass and another running south from Cleenseau ->` Maseau ->` Isingue
[2024-01-28 06:28 PM] Deciusmus: but say, Raven's Hold is probably pretty marginal/doesn't exist/definitely isn't on a human trade road
[2024-01-28 06:28 PM] Deciusmus: Post Great War things shift as Urlich is destroyed (the impact of that I think was pretty brutal, it probably pretty much entirely depopulated the Duchy of Brovna, which I was envisioning as one of the richest duchies, sitting in Urlich / trade center  etc)
[2024-01-28 06:29 PM] rsulfuratus: Ravens Hold is originally constructed as part of a series of defenses in northern dunmar against hobgoblin activity pre-Great War
[2024-01-28 06:29 PM] Deciusmus: right, that fits the above perfectly
[2024-01-28 06:30 PM] Deciusmus: although I guess also with Ardith still intact the heart of the mountains were probably safer
[2024-01-28 06:30 PM] rsulfuratus: Below the mountains, yes. But I think the foothills were pretty dangerous
[2024-01-28 06:30 PM] Deciusmus: but the sweep of land where the Reofounded Alliance of Aurbez is now would have been pretty dangerous as well, I imagine
[2024-01-28 06:31 PM] rsulfuratus: Yes. Ardith would have been pretty fortified as well
[2024-01-28 06:33 PM] Deciusmus: Anyway, in my "grand sweep of Sembaran history v2" I'm basically imagining, with the fall of Avatus, a series of powerful duchies established along the borders - Maseau and Brovna, in particular - which is a big expansion in the size of sembara and a big centralization of power as these duchies are much more under the control of the monarch than the traidtional duchies
[2024-01-28 08:38 PM] rsulfuratus: added a few small notes to the human funerary traditions page, but generally would say it is good
