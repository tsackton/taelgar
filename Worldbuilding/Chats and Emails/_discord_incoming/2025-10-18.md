[2025-10-18 09:56 AM] Deciusmus: We are about to go hiking with Laura but a few quick thoughts:
    
    in my head lizardfolk around sembara at least have a sense of having been on the land for a long time. They are not I think anti-human (or at least not most of them, maybe there is a radical strain somewhere that sees humans as settler-colonists). But they are self sufficient for the most part and it isn’t uncommon for them to be a little insular
[2025-10-18 09:57 AM] Deciusmus: - they pretty much only settle places where they are self sufficient for basic food and necessities
[2025-10-18 09:57 AM] Deciusmus: So trade is never critical
