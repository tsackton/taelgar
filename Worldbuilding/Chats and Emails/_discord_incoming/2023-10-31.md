# Discord DM – 2023-10-31

[2023-10-31 08:06 PM] rsulfuratus: working on a species reorganization, fyi, on the species-reorg branch. trying to move all the various notes from google docs on different types of creatures in taelgar to obsidian, and also create a bit more clarity on playable species
[2023-10-31 08:06 PM] rsulfuratus: easiest to checkout locally and browse in Obsidian, imo, if you care
[2023-10-31 08:07 PM] Deciusmus: I’m in the weeds on hobgoblin troop movements in the 1640s 😀
[2023-10-31 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: hah
[2023-10-31 08:26 PM] Deciusmus: you ok wit River Aure as the canonical name for the river that flows out of Addermarch
[2023-10-31 08:26 PM] Deciusmus: highlighted
![[../_discord_assets/image-377D2.png]]
[2023-10-31 09:05 PM] rsulfuratus: that sounds good to me
[2023-10-31 09:05 PM] Deciusmus: It was in some doc of yours with a ?
[2023-10-31 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: do you have any thoughts on kobolds?
[2023-10-31 09:06 PM] Deciusmus: not really
[2023-10-31 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: I've been hesistant to introduce more than orcs and hobgoblins because I feel like an endless proliferation of "bad" non-human races gets confusing
[2023-10-31 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: I've used them a bunch as kind of 'not-quite-enemies' in Isaac's campaign, but you all never bit on the investigating kobold raiders in the myrenai gap side quest in the Dunmar campaign
[2023-10-31 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: Which isn't to say they shouldn't exist or anything but I've been cautious about having too much going on at once
[2023-10-31 09:08 PM] Deciusmus: in my game, I mean
[2023-10-31 09:08 PM] rsulfuratus: in my typology the only creations of the Void Mind / Three Despairs are orcs and goblinoids, plus undead (Ghesyn, the Soul Eater) and lycanthropes (Jinnik)
[2023-10-31 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: so anything else wouldn't be a strictly evil race IMO
[2023-10-31 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: right, makes sense
[2023-10-31 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: I think if there were background lying around in Obsidian on kobolds I might use them somewhere, I just don't have any thoughts on them, per se
[2023-10-31 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: kobolds in my mind were created by dragons in the early days of the world and basically got left behind when the elder wyrms diminished in power during the Long Pause
[2023-10-31 09:10 PM] rsulfuratus: in any case if you haven't used them for anything I can add some notes based on how I've introduced them in Isaac's game and my general thoughts
[2023-10-31 09:10 PM] rsulfuratus: will probably be pretty thin to start
[2023-10-31 09:25 PM] Deciusmus: Pushed a big update to the 1590s - 1650s in the Sembaran timeline
[2023-10-31 09:56 PM] Deciusmus: how about River Valmont for the river that flows from Addermarch to the Istaros
[2023-10-31 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2023-10-31 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus: this is part of the plaguelands after great war; the forest south of adderfell is the darkwood that is generally considered haunted and dangerous
[2023-10-31 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-10-31 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: I'm just making stubs for everything in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHG3lRP0M1K4jEJ1qh6xumRopiUJ_k5nCBfewwiHZKw/edit
[2023-10-31 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: And the River Istaros had
    Arises from the confluence of the Andonne and the UnnamedRiverInAdderfmarch
[2023-10-31 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: Figured why not give it a name
[2023-10-31 10:08 PM] Deciusmus: how about the Marches of Borvina for the last unnamed Sembaran geopolitical unit, the one near the mountains by Ardlas (called WM4 on some maps)
[2023-10-31 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: The doc has this:
    
    `<Dwarven Kingdoms>`
    Darakan (Seeker’s hometown)
    
    But I don't know which kingdom it is in
[2023-10-31 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus: https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/The%20Central%20Highlands%20Region/Dwarven%20Kingdoms/Khatridun.html
[2023-10-31 10:13 PM] Deciusmus: ah, it is in the Khatridun note. I won't bother making a separate note for now
[2023-10-31 10:24 PM] Deciusmus: I added stubs for everything in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHG3lRP0M1K4jEJ1qh6xumRopiUJ_k5nCBfewwiHZKw/edit except:
    
    * Ankola (ruined)
    Fiamatara Mountains (west of Voltara)
    Erbalta Plains (north of Voltara)
    Amani (former kingdom north of Chardon, around where Voltara is now)
    Pandar (former kingdom in far north)
    Sayuna Islands (western island chain, west of Chardon in Endless Ocean)
    
    Plus the `<xx>` ones
