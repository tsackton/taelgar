[2025-06-01 01:15 PM] rsulfuratus: fwiw, i think my feywild arc notes are more or less completely incorporated. many are still behind secret blocks and i didn't really have the energy to figure out if there are any actual secrets remaining but easy enough to do if there are specific pages you are drawing from for developing any upcoming feywild stuff in your campaign that pulls from this (especially Harrow/Wend stuff - never figured out the exact map but Hollowdark and/or Darkfall are more or less immediately south of Twilight's Grace
