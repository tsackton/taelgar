# Discord DM – 2025-07-27

[2025-07-27 09:34 AM] rsulfuratus: mostly working on dnd but poked around a bit at alaska logistics here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SDqwcpT4_Lb9R5BLT8UBFKjK8ee0VaJEO7tfq70UbR4/edit?usp=sharing
[2025-07-27 09:36 AM] rsulfuratus: the logistics are actually quite tricky. i looked at a bunch of air taxi and sea plane service for august and all the scheduled service i could find caps at 9 people
[2025-07-27 09:36 AM] rsulfuratus: (august 2025 since june 2026 not out yet)
[2025-07-27 09:38 AM] rsulfuratus: the real annoyance is juneau ->` glacier bay because if you are limited to scheduled non-seaplane service you either take the AA jet flight which lands too late to do kayaking on arrival day, or you need to time the ferry
[2025-07-27 09:41 AM] rsulfuratus: it is actually easier to arrive glacier bay direct from boston than arrive sitka direct from boston, so could start glacier bay
[2025-07-27 09:42 AM] rsulfuratus: but still get in too late for a kayak (and landing at 4:30 pm local / 8:30 pm Boston after long day probably don't want to do anything too strenous)
[2025-07-27 09:42 AM] rsulfuratus: so it is really tough to figure out a way to do hiking, boat tour, kayak, and whale watch from glacier bay w/o 3 nights there
[2025-07-27 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: I think you are playing D&D today but what do you think of this:
    
    Fri: 11:20 am SEA ->` Sitka, land 12:53 pm. Night Sitka.
    Sat: All day Sitka. Night Sitka.
    Sun: All day Sitka. Fly Sitka ->` Juneau (dep: 7 pm, arr: 8 pm). Night Juneau. 
    Mon: All day Juneau.
    Tues: All day Juneau.
    Wed: Morning/afternoon Juneau. Fly Juneau to Glacier Bay (dep: 4 pm, arr: 4:40 pm). Night Glacier Bay.
    Thurs: All day Glacier Bay.
    Fri: Morning/afternoon Glacier Bay. Fly Glacier Bay to Juneau (dep: 5:35, land: 6:10 pm), then Juneau to SEA (dep: 6:55 pm, land 10:15 pm). 
    
    Only 737s so don't have to worry about air taxi cost (for multi-plane charters) or ferry schedules or other issues with small planes not being able to fit us all. 
    
    Biggest downside is it is a much nicer itinerary if you can spend a night in Seattle on either end. I'm not sure how that fits into your plans
[2025-07-27 04:49 PM] rsulfuratus: You can actually fit in the Glacier Bay boat tour on the last Friday, it gets back in time to connect to the flight to Juneau. So could do three whale watches (Sitka, Juneau, Gustavus); two kayaks (Sitka; Glacier Bay); two tidewater glacier cruises (Juneau; Gustavus) and still have a day and half in Sitka, a day in Juneau, and a half-day in Glacier Bay free for hiking / other things
[2025-07-27 05:30 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah playing D&D
[2025-07-27 05:30 PM] Deciusmus: Leaving now will look when I get home
[2025-07-27 07:54 PM] Deciusmus: This could work - what’s the upside versus the reverse though? Ie glacier bay first - if everyone was on west coast anyway.
    
    Or alternatively do Jun-GB-Sitka?
[2025-07-27 07:55 PM] Deciusmus: Wait ignore that last one
[2025-07-27 07:58 PM] rsulfuratus: two minor downsides to the reverse:
[2025-07-27 07:58 PM] rsulfuratus: (1) cruises are never in Sitka on Sat, so nice to be there over a Sat, which only works if we go there first
[2025-07-27 08:00 PM] rsulfuratus: (2) the flight times JNU->`SIT aren't quite as good as the reverse. 
    SIT ->` JNU (45 min) at 6 am and 7:08 pm 
    JNU ->` SIT (45 min) at 9:20 am or 10:15 pm
[2025-07-27 08:00 PM] rsulfuratus: 7:08 pm is a nice flight, gives you all day in Sitka then early dinner and transfer to Juneau (or late dinner in Juneau). JNU ->` SIT at 10:15 pm just means a bit of a late night
[2025-07-27 08:00 PM] rsulfuratus: but it does work in reverse
[2025-07-27 08:01 PM] Deciusmus: The only advantage of the reverse is you can go Sitka - Seattle - Boston in one day
[2025-07-27 08:03 PM] rsulfuratus: you can but you have to take the 7 am flight from Sitka. so you really only have 1 day in Sitka then
[2025-07-27 08:04 PM] rsulfuratus: so it is a trade off. you get a bit of extra time in Juneau, since you have 3 full days plus an evening, instead of 2 1/2 days, but you get 1 day in Sitka instead of 2 1/2 days
[2025-07-27 08:05 PM] rsulfuratus: alternatively could just add a night in Sitka and fly home 7 am on Saturday instead of 7 am Friday, and do 2 - 3 - 3
[2025-07-27 08:06 PM] rsulfuratus: (and anyone who didn't want a long travel day (M&T) could take the 1:40 to Seattle on Sat and fly Seattle - Bos on Sun)
[2025-07-27 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: I talked to Mama and Tob and they were planning at least one night in SEA on both ends to avoid 12+ hour travel days so they are flexible
[2025-07-27 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: Laura is unclear, haven't talked to her
[2025-07-27 08:08 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah although we might rather spend Fri in Sea and go home at a reasonable time on Sat then get home 12:05am
[2025-07-27 08:08 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-07-27 08:09 PM] Deciusmus: Would you do San Juan after or before?
[2025-07-27 08:10 PM] Deciusmus: Or skip it? Or are you not sure
[2025-07-27 08:11 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure whether before or after is easier. kate and i haven't discussed
[2025-07-27 08:11 PM] rsulfuratus: and i haven't looked at logistics yet and whether it is manageable with 2 nights in SEA or whether we need 3 and how it connects to the Alaska flights
[2025-07-27 08:12 PM] rsulfuratus: but i was tentatively thinking after if we do the SIT ->` JNU ->` GST. we'd spend Fri night at an airport hotel, rent car AM Sat, spend Sat night in San Juan Islands, spent Sun night in Sea and see Kate's friend, fly home Mon
[2025-07-27 08:13 PM] rsulfuratus: that is likely easiest, adds only one day off at cost of having to deal with working day after we get home
[2025-07-27 08:15 PM] rsulfuratus: also works with GST ->` JNU ->` SIT, actually, we'd just go straight from SIT to San Juan islands on Sat (spend Fri night in SIT)
[2025-07-27 08:16 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I think we are probably going to do some sort of pre-trip - either 6 nights (Sat-Thur) or 2 nights (Wed-Thur)
[2025-07-27 08:17 PM] Deciusmus: So plenty of flexibility on the arrival side.
[2025-07-27 08:17 PM] rsulfuratus: we could also shift to Sat-Sat instead of Fri-Fri, that would make it easier for us to do a pre-trip instead of post-trip, and might be simpler
[2025-07-27 08:17 PM] Deciusmus: Ie if we did San Fran for 2 nights it’s easy to get a flight SFO-SEA-SIT on Fri
[2025-07-27 08:19 PM] Deciusmus: It’s actually better for us to be fri-fri because if we are going away for close to 2 weeks we’d want to be home no later than Sat late afternoon
[2025-07-27 08:20 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-07-27 08:20 PM] rsulfuratus: it doesn't really matter to us that much, just we would do the seattle stuff after if we do fri-fri, and before if we do sat-sat
[2025-07-27 08:21 PM] Deciusmus: We could make Sat-Sat work but not if we ended in Glacier Bay
[2025-07-27 08:21 PM] Deciusmus: Although I guess we could do Saturday-Sat with a post-trip instead
[2025-07-27 08:22 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't have a strong feeling, and i don't think M&T do, so just should check with laura to see if it matters to her
[2025-07-27 08:22 PM] rsulfuratus: she could theoretically fly bos->`sit on fri, there is a 7 am alaska air flight that connects to the sea->`sit flight
[2025-07-27 08:23 PM] Deciusmus: On a different topic, I am not convinced Juneau - Haines - Glacier Bay is impossible - if we want to do flight seeing in particular I bet we could organize Haines to Glacier Bay. It would probably just be in 2 planes
[2025-07-27 08:24 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah haines is the most likely option to be able to get haines ->` glacier bay on a small plane
[2025-07-27 08:25 PM] rsulfuratus: this place has regularly scheduled air taxi between Haines and Gustavus and would be easy to combine with flightseeing. https://mountainflyingservice.com/southeast-alaska-air-taxi-services
[2025-07-27 08:25 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I saw that
[2025-07-27 08:26 PM] rsulfuratus: the biggest downside to haines is that while it has a lot of good hiking and kayaking, it does not have good whale watching or glaciers
[2025-07-27 08:27 PM] rsulfuratus: the lynn canal ferry seems cool but i'm not convinced haines has as much to do that matches our interests
[2025-07-27 08:28 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe though you should contact the mountain flying service and just see if it would be feasible. if that doesn't work then it is not worth further exploration
[2025-07-27 08:42 PM] Deciusmus: One upside to Haines is there are moose there although far from guaranteed
[2025-07-27 08:43 PM] Deciusmus: https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/viewing/pdfs/haines.pdf
[2025-07-27 09:39 PM] Deciusmus: If Laura is okay with the flights I think either 
    
    Sitka Juneau Glacier Bay
    
    Or
    
    Juneau Haines Glacier Bay
    
    Are probably the two best options - dependent on Haines air service being something we are willing to pay
[2025-07-27 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah Laura okay with flights. i agree those seem the best.
[2025-07-27 09:41 PM] rsulfuratus: if haines air service not feasible for logistcs/capacity/price, i think no choice to make. if haines air service feasible, we can send both options and discuss with group
[2025-07-27 09:42 PM] rsulfuratus: i was looking at haines a bit more and if we aren't doing a bear fly out from juneau (probably not worth the money given timing), it might be appealing as it gives seems like it gives us best land mammal options (although none nearly as likely as whales)
