# Discord DM – 2024-01-02

[2024-01-02 10:41 AM] Deciusmus: I assume you haven't gotten to this; I have a few more tweaks to Sembara
[2024-01-02 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus: Correct
[2024-01-02 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus: Might do it tonight so send whatever other tweaks you have
[2024-01-02 01:09 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-6CD2B.png]]
[2024-01-02 01:09 PM] Deciusmus: the 3 added grey boxes are new hills : extensions of Braebine and Aine Hills, plus the new Aveil Ridge
[2024-01-02 01:10 PM] Deciusmus: The arrows show the direction the lines of hills run; Braebine and Aine are basically where the land starts to rise towards the highlands
[2024-01-02 01:11 PM] Deciusmus: The green areas are new forests, one just north of Cleenseau the other extending along the entire highand side of the Aine Hills
[2024-01-02 01:12 PM] Deciusmus: There are several new rivers in blue; the ones in Arnsbury and Tyrwingha are a bit arbitrary and could be whatever feels right on the map; the forked river in Aveil I've made up stuff for
[2024-01-02 01:12 PM] Deciusmus: The new river in "WM4" is to establish a bit of a border
[2024-01-02 01:15 PM] Deciusmus: Then, if you want to tweak the political units layer:
    
    The section labeled #1 around Dunore is the new Barony of Usbourg
    The section labeled #2 around Ainwick is the (now much smaller) Barony of Ainwick
    The "highlands" region of Sembara proper grows to include everything north of Chemin/Ainwick/Usbourg (labeled 4, but hard to see)
    The "WM4" (Marches of Bronva) is everything west of the new river in WM
[2024-01-02 01:17 PM] Deciusmus: Also TM1/TM2 are gone and just "Tyrwingha" and I'd be inclined to make Adderfell a bit smaller
[2024-01-02 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed new version of world map
[2024-01-02 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus: generally for precise detail I'd suggest making a separate hexmap since it is difficult to represent things that are `<30 miles or so on the world map
[2024-01-02 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that makes sense
[2024-01-02 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus: I've used these
[Attachment: ACKS_BlankHexMaps.pdf](../_discord_assets/ACKS_BlankHexMaps-09DEB.pdf)
[2024-01-02 10:13 PM] Deciusmus: looks great
[2024-01-02 10:15 PM] Deciusmus: I've drawn detail maps with https://inkarnate.com
[2024-01-02 10:15 PM] Deciusmus: you can see the Cleenseau town one and the Cleenseau region one in obsidian
[2024-01-02 10:29 PM] rsulfuratus: reading your letters now
[2024-01-02 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm not sure that Amberglow would ever have extended as far north as Cleenseau
[2024-01-02 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus: feywild geography is not a perfect match for material plane geography - but even so that would make amberglow very big
[2024-01-02 10:36 PM] Deciusmus: I didn't mean to imply it did
[2024-01-02 10:36 PM] Deciusmus: where did you get that from?
[2024-01-02 10:36 PM] Deciusmus: Vahavia's report?
[2024-01-02 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-01-02 10:37 PM] Deciusmus: They would not have thought that this was Amberglow, just contrasting it to a more pleasant fey place
[2024-01-02 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus: ah - in that case I would think he'd refer to Dreamhaven
[2024-01-02 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus: I mean it is kind of a meaningless detail
[2024-01-02 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus: but of course pre Great War the elves of Ainuymara would have relatively close contact with Dreamhaven
[2024-01-02 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I was thinking the elves of Rostare might have had a connect to Amberglow. Might just drop it though, my players have no idea what any of these realms mean
[2024-01-02 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-01-02 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: wait, I also confused myself
[2024-01-02 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus: Vahaiya is not from Rostare - that was gone long before they were born
[2024-01-02 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: Ignore Rostare above, that not from the Vahaiya letter, it was in the drankor stuff
[2024-01-02 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus: you also have Marcel de Valarin dying in 1658, which is before the Vahaiya letter
[2024-01-02 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: oops
[2024-01-02 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: I should fix his death date
[2024-01-02 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: it isn't canonical, just tossed in
[2024-01-02 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus: in 'An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realms' I would change Rostare to Orenlas
[2024-01-02 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus: Rostare is really far away - like 2000 miles from Tyrwingha
[2024-01-02 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus: whereas Orenlas is immediately next door and would be concerned with the fey in their neighborhood
[2024-01-02 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: Ah, for some reason I thought it was close to Drankor
[2024-01-02 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: but yeah, makes sense
[2024-01-02 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus: it is close to drankor. drankor is 2000 miles from Tyrwingha
[2024-01-02 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: I guess Drankor is really far away
[2024-01-02 10:45 PM] Deciusmus: BTW, I think what ultimately caused the rift between Ethlenn and Umbraeth was his tendency to trick humans into the Feywild either to be his servants, or even to be ensorcelled by other fey outside of Twiligt's Grace, or just for giggles to be left somewhere dangerous to die
[2024-01-02 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus: i like that
[2024-01-02 10:46 PM] Deciusmus: She probably tolerates some amount of fey-being-fey around humans, but violating the refuge she extended to Tyrwinghans to come to the Feywild is unforgiveable
[2024-01-02 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus: other than those comments I think the letters and books are fine. i removed the status/tim and pushed but didn't make other changes so assume you'll make small edits as discussed / clean up
[2024-01-02 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: yup
[2024-01-02 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: I rewrote the Amberglow line to just talk about stories of "realms"
[2024-01-02 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: unnamed
[2024-01-02 10:48 PM] rsulfuratus: oh, one other thing - I'm not actually sure how closely related demi-planes and fey / shadowfell domains are. i might remove the mention of demiplanes from the drankor book since it seems unnecessary game-wise to link them
[2024-01-02 10:50 PM] Deciusmus: In another my game topic, the lich's plan to destroy Sembara is coming into view.... 
    
    Step 1: Cast a really powerful and hard to cast spell (took a year or two of prep) that caused a decent percent (1%?) of the dead in southern Sembara to rise up as zombies/skeletons/etc
    Step 2: Absolutely and completely mismanage the response...
[2024-01-02 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus: really minor point
[2024-01-02 10:51 PM] Deciusmus: The mismanagement involves things like imposing a wealth tax to raise an army, but doing so on halflings and lizardfolk as well as humans (which is not what sembaran law says)
[2024-01-02 10:51 PM] Deciusmus: Having some of his controlled barons (he only has a few) collect the tax twice
[2024-01-02 10:52 PM] Deciusmus: Mixing up the army and sending it various different places, so Fellburn stays under siege from a bunch of hobgoblin zombies through the winter,
[2024-01-02 10:52 PM] Deciusmus: Specifically trying to stir up the Duke of Wisford so he rebels
[2024-01-02 10:52 PM] Deciusmus: etc
[2024-01-02 10:53 PM] Deciusmus: Whatever my PCs do, a group of adventures is going to kill the lich in 6 months (July 1720) and things will get fixed after that
[2024-01-02 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus: why does the lich want to destroy Sembara again?
[2024-01-02 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus: or does it not matter for the campaign?
[2024-01-02 10:55 PM] Deciusmus: It matters a lot for the 2nd part of the campaign, but not entirely sorted out. The short version is that he was a wizard with a desire for life extension, doing dubious research, the House of Sewick specifically destroyed his research/tried him for illegal magic, he escaped, vowed revenge on the House of Sewick
[2024-01-02 10:55 PM] Deciusmus: So actually it is less about destroying Sembara than the House of Sewick specifically. Probably he is hoping one of the northern dukes will eventually organize a coup of some kind
[2024-01-02 10:56 PM] Deciusmus: I have a vague backstory but I need to work it out a little bit more, at the moment it is still a bit unclear, other than a personal vendetta against the House of Sewick for what he sees as ruining his life
[2024-01-02 11:01 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed one more book - contains a bunch of stories about fey - less impact on other parts of the world or things you made up, but I did leave it status/tim
[2024-01-02 11:01 PM] Deciusmus: going to bed now
