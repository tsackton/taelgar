# Discord DM – 2023-12-08

[2023-12-08 10:05 AM] Deciusmus: pushed a few bits and pieces of status update: tagged a bunch of pages "status/tim" from status/draft or similar if I read the page and think it is done
[2023-12-08 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus: have break and am doing a bit of gazetteer reorganizing. curious which you prefer:
    1) have the gazetteer top level remain regions, and have subdirectories for realms and geographic features in that region. pro: all the "stuff" for one area in one directory. con: the same river ends up with two different pages in two different regions (the Mahar, currently, has potentially three pages: Mahar, Istaros, Kulthul). 
    2) reorganize gazetteer to separate out realms and geographic features, which can have different groupings. pro: allows more natural grouping of geographic features by topology and watershed. con: the page for ~Tokra Plains~ and Tokra are no where near each other
    3) don't bother organizing the gazetteer by region at all, and have directories for rivers, forests, etc, and just rely on whereabouts/partof to make lists of things near each other. pros: easiest to sort new pages into. cons: requires tagging and dataview to work, might be hard to browse online
[2023-12-08 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus: there are various intergrades too. for example rivers specifically could be handled separately, either by forcing region boundaries to conform to rivershed boundaries or by moving rivers out of the general region hierarchy
[2023-12-08 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus: my vague preference is #2, because I find having the March of Ardonne grouped with Dunmar a bit silly, but I also find having the Istaros and the Drogar, which are the same river, in two different regions to be a bit annoying.
[2023-12-08 10:17 AM] Deciusmus: Hrm
[2023-12-08 10:18 AM] Deciusmus: I think it is a good point that the current organization is a bit confusing
[2023-12-08 10:22 AM] Deciusmus: I think it is useful to be able to find things "nearby"  so I don't like #3
[2023-12-08 10:25 AM] Deciusmus: Broadly, I like how Western Green Sea is organized, which is basically:
    
    Realm
    Rivers
    Roads
    a few random pages for major geographic features
    
    and then "small" geographic features live inside the realm directory
[2023-12-08 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus: I think that is in part an artifact of the kind of detail that has been invented for Sembara
[2023-12-08 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus: e.g., the two things I'm working on mostly right now are the north coast of the western green sea and a reorg of Dunmar, and that organization doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense for either of those areas
[2023-12-08 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus: in part because in both cases there is a lot of wilderness that is not part of any realm
[2023-12-08 10:29 AM] Deciusmus: I think the actual problem is that the the broad area bordered by Myrani Gap/Nevos Sea/Sentinals/Mostreve Hills/South Cymean Coast/Undefined Eastern Mountains/Sea of Storms (the "Istaros Watershed") really is across several different political units
[2023-12-08 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus: and realms don't neatly line up with geographic features
[2023-12-08 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus: the plaguelands is a major political divide but not a geographic divide
[2023-12-08 10:30 AM] Deciusmus: right
[2023-12-08 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus: it would be completely neatly organized if you just moved everything south of the mostreve hills to the central lowlands
[2023-12-08 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus: but that is annoying for different reasons
[2023-12-08 10:30 AM] Deciusmus: But actually the west coast has the same problem-- the major rivers stretch deep into the mountains
[2023-12-08 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-12-08 10:31 AM] Deciusmus: and if you are talking about geography/climate/watersheds you kinda want a different divide than politics a bit
[2023-12-08 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus: right, that is kind of my suggestion above
[2023-12-08 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus: political spheres of influence and geographic regions don't line up
[2023-12-08 10:35 AM] Deciusmus: I am just not totally sold on that from a "making things up" standpoint
[2023-12-08 10:36 AM] Deciusmus: Where do I put a page on the Aurbez Plateau? It is entirely within the refounded alliance...
[2023-12-08 10:36 AM] Deciusmus: but it is a geographic feature
[2023-12-08 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus: right
[2023-12-08 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus: so browsing some of the imo better D&D sourcebooks, it seems the usual solution is to just have super unrealistic maps with like 5% of the river systems the world would actually have
[2023-12-08 10:37 AM] Deciusmus: I actually think Taelgar doesn't have enough rivers! 🙂
[2023-12-08 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah it has way too few. i have a bunch of new dunmari rivers
[2023-12-08 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus: although it has a decent number of trunks/main lines
[2023-12-08 10:38 AM] Deciusmus: Sembara feels good to me, ignoring the little brooks and streams
[2023-12-08 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus: everything just needs about 20 more tributaries
[2023-12-08 10:38 AM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-12-08 10:38 AM] Deciusmus: actually the mapped areas are pretty good
[2023-12-08 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus: I have a ton more rivers in the north coast too
[2023-12-08 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus: you'll see when you finally bother to go to Tollen and the kenku scout describes the area to wellby to map ;-0
[2023-12-08 10:39 AM] Deciusmus: heh 🙂
[2023-12-08 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus: i guess rivers are actually the major challenge in some sense
[2023-12-08 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: I actually think the right answer lies a bit in "why are you writing a page"
[2023-12-08 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: I think there is fun/value in having well developed climate/geographic overview/river system pages
[2023-12-08 10:41 AM] Deciusmus: but I think those are kinda orthogonal to the "political units, small forests, little brooks, bridges, towns, ruined forts" type pages that give color to an are
[2023-12-08 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus: sure but something like 90% of river pages are just stubs anyway to track a name
[2023-12-08 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: maybe it makes sense to just pull rivers (and maybe roads? less certain there) out of the region organization
[2023-12-08 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: or at least, pull major watersheds that span political regions
[2023-12-08 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: this would basically be the chasa watershed and the hara/mahar/istaros watershed
[2023-12-08 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: Right I think what I am suggesting is that I think having something ike:
    
    
    Gazetteer
    - Western Green Sea Region
    --- Volta Watershed
    --- Semb Watershed
    --- Mostreve Hills
    - Central Lowlands Region
    --- Istaros Watershed
    --- Dunmari Basin
    - Green Sea Realms
    --- Tollen
    --- Sembara
    - Dunmar
    - Dwarven Realms
    ---- Nardith
    - Chardonian Empire
    ---
    - North Coast Realms
    --- Mawar
[2023-12-08 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: could work
[2023-12-08 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: Maybe that's too many folders though
[2023-12-08 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: I can't decide if depth is better or worse than long lists though
[2023-12-08 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: I guess I would say that the top level folders should aim to be a large grouping of subfolders that make sense to access together
[2023-12-08 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus: Probably a strict organization is too hard
[2023-12-08 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus: E.g., I want Dunmar in the Central Lowlands region because there is a lot of adjacent wilderness that is adventuring territory
[2023-12-08 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus: or, you want those in the same folder
[2023-12-08 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus: i prefer to keep the top level contents of any one folder to around 10 max
[2023-12-08 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: Note that we don't attempt to do that for people at all
[2023-12-08 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah for people it seems less important because at least from a browsing perspective you are usually going to be going from a link
[2023-12-08 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus: we also don't have folder pages for people for imo the same reason, you don't really click on "halflings" and then browse
[2023-12-08 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus: originally we organized by species/ancestry for automation purposes, not sure that is still useful but nice to break things up somehow
[2023-12-08 10:56 AM] Deciusmus: Not sure I want to think about people, but honestly its an area where a pretty flat list would probably be fine. What I actually want is to be able to see all the people in Cleenseau, but tagging+dataview works a lot better for that than folders
[2023-12-08 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: right, not interested in reorging people now
[2023-12-08 10:56 AM] Deciusmus: Back to places...
[2023-12-08 10:56 AM] Deciusmus: one challenge is that things get made up at weird levels of detail
[2023-12-08 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus: I think to simplify the current issue before I get back to working on work: all I'd really like to decide right now is how to handle river systems that span regions, from three options:
    1) pull large watersheds (for some definition of large) out of region folders entirely and organize watershed-related geographic features (primarily rivers) independently
    2) move some river pages to be in the region hierarchy that is where the bulk of the river system is, even if that means there is a bit of annoying jumping back and forth for a handful of regions where the river system and the political sphere of influence don't line up (e.g., Elderwood rivers on the west coast and the Aurbez-area tributaries of the Istaros)
    3) Just rely on linking with ![[]]. Have a master page for each river in the region where it is most contained and then for e.g. the Istaros just link the Mahar (doesn't work as well for tributaries)
[2023-12-08 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus: 4) something else
[2023-12-08 11:03 AM] Deciusmus: I like #1
[2023-12-08 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: okay, yeah that is what I am leaning towards as well.
[2023-12-08 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: I am going to pull istaros-mahar out into its own group and we can see how that works
[2023-12-08 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: easy to move pages back if needed
[2023-12-08 11:05 AM] Deciusmus: I'm not convinced that for climate description purposes it doesn't make more sense to tie the region to the watershed, but that is not a critical decision for right now
[2023-12-08 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus: it does make more sense for sure
[2023-12-08 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus: probably the best organization is actually to have large scale geography (climate, mountains, rivers, large scale geographic features) organized separately from "regions"
[2023-12-08 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus: where "region" is more like "sphere of influence"
[2023-12-08 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus: basically have a top-down structure and a bottom up structure
[2023-12-08 11:07 AM] Deciusmus: yeah, that is kinda what I was trying to describe above, but I don't think I quite hit it
[2023-12-08 11:07 AM] Deciusmus: but what you are saying makes a lot of sense
[2023-12-08 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus: right, yeah
[2023-12-08 11:08 AM] Deciusmus: something like my page on Aurbez and the Ardonne probably belongs in the Istaros-Mahar watershed
[2023-12-08 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus: I should have probably done this on a branch but too late now
[2023-12-08 11:09 AM] Deciusmus: whereas the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez belongs "near" Maseau and Sembara
[2023-12-08 11:09 AM] Deciusmus: eh, that's fine
[2023-12-08 11:09 AM] Deciusmus: I'm not in the middle of anything
[2023-12-08 11:30 AM] Deciusmus: just push at some point even if in progress because I have a 2 hr planning meeting this afternoon that I will probably ignore parts of and work on something or other
[2023-12-08 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus: okay
[2023-12-08 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus: what do you think of this?
    
    Chasa-Nahadi Watershed
    - the Chasa and Nahadi river systems (including lake valandros)
    - all the forested slopes of the western sentinels
    - deno'qai villages excluding northern deno'qai from delwath solo
    
    Isataros-Mahar Watershed
    - plaguelands
    - xurkhaz
    - all the rivers that feed into this large river system, excluding the hara
    - the aurbez geographic region pages
    - orenlas
    
    West Coast
    - Chardonian Empire
    - Mawar
    - rivers entirely contained within this region, including the Yeraad
    - nevos sea
    - geographic features w/i or near these areas and not already in the Chasa-Nahadi watershed
    
    Dunmar Region
    - all of Dunmar
    - Hara river system
    - Nashtkar
    - Garamjala
    - various geographic features contained entirely within this area
    - Yuvanti and Nardith
    
    Western Green Sea
    (this is large, could be split, probably by moving skaerhem and vostok out and merging with ursk into a north green sea coast)
    - all of "greater semabara"
    - cymea
    - vostok
    - tollen
    - skaerhem
    - geographic features contained within these regions
    
    Eastern Green Sea
    - ursk
    - irrla
    - eastern islands
    - medju
    
    Far North
    (stub)
    
    South
    (stub, just Kenzo solo)
[2023-12-08 11:31 AM] Deciusmus: where are the sentinals?
[2023-12-08 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah just realized
[2023-12-08 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus: they'd be a top-level directory
[2023-12-08 11:31 AM] Deciusmus: I'd make them a top level folder
[2023-12-08 11:32 AM] Deciusmus: but looks good
[2023-12-08 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus: I have to get back to work by noon so I'm going to do a reorg then push
[2023-12-08 11:35 AM] Deciusmus: I'd actually be tempted to split Greater Sembara out into its own top level, with Cymea/Skaerhem/Vostok/Tollen as the "Western Green Sea"
[2023-12-08 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus: you wouldn't put Tollen in Greater Sembara? seems like there are a lot of links there
[2023-12-08 11:39 AM] Deciusmus: yeah, probably
[2023-12-08 11:39 AM] Deciusmus: actually
[2023-12-08 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus: although also a lot of links between Tollen and Cymea
[2023-12-08 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus: but that is actually probably fine to span regions
[2023-12-08 11:39 AM] Deciusmus: yeah, I was originally thinking it has a lot more ties to the broader Green Sea than Sembara does
[2023-12-08 11:39 AM] Deciusmus: hence "western green sea"
[2023-12-08 11:39 AM] Deciusmus: but it is really a melting pot, which is always going to be wrong no matter who you group it with
[2023-12-08 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus: conceptually though from a features point of view the north coast (skaerhem/vostok/ursk) is distinct from "greater sembara" (sembara/tyrwingha/highland/marches) and "western green sea" (tollen/cymea)
[2023-12-08 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus: I think actually I'd prefer too many top level categories for now and we can collapse later so I might just to that
[2023-12-08 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus: then irrla/eastern islands/medju is eastern green sea
[2023-12-08 11:41 AM] Deciusmus: Vostok doesn't feel north coast to me, the forests in central vostok stretch directly to the sembaran highlands
[2023-12-08 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus: guess that's true
[2023-12-08 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus: but parts of the coast is very skaer-influenced
[2023-12-08 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus: maybe it should just be one big thing
[2023-12-08 11:42 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah, it is a another melting pot
[2023-12-08 11:42 AM] Deciusmus: To me, making Greater Sembara top level is useful just to have less depth for my cleenseau pages
[2023-12-08 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus: i think right now I'm doing greater sembara just as highland kingdoms marches tyrwingha sembara
[2023-12-08 11:43 AM] Deciusmus: yeah that works
[2023-12-08 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus: the tollen/cymea/skaerhem/vostok as western green sea
[2023-12-08 11:43 AM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-12-08 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus: pushed
[2023-12-08 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus: keeps rivers together for the most part, main consequence is separating politics from geography for aurbez area and for chasa river valley. but i think that is fine
[2023-12-08 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus: (didn't move little brooks or anything, fat brook in tollen is still in tollen even though volta is in Greater Sembara)
[2023-12-08 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus: also makes the whole desolation of cha'mutte thing cleaner, since this is all in mahar-istaros watershed now
[2023-12-08 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus: might still shift a few things around (garamjala probably should move to mahar watershed from Greater Dunmar; might split the eastern and western halves of the far north so forest of nightmares and ursk aren't lumped together)
[2023-12-08 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus: but busy rest of day so won't mess around further until tonight or tomorrow, if then (need to do session notes and session prep for my low level minigame which wraps up sunday)
[2023-12-08 12:00 PM] Deciusmus: I might mess around with Sembara org a bit
[2023-12-08 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2023-12-08 12:00 PM] Deciusmus: and potentially rewrite the "Geography of Taelgar" page to better characterize the places
[2023-12-08 12:01 PM] Deciusmus: what is your feeling on ~xxx~ places? In Worldbuilding\Unnamed or "where they belong"?
[2023-12-08 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus: where they belong
[2023-12-08 12:01 PM] Deciusmus: I might do a bit of that type of cleanup then as well
[2023-12-08 12:02 PM] Deciusmus: If I am listenting to a planning meeting I only 40% care about its perfect type of background task
[2023-12-08 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: Taelgar needs a couple of endorheic (not draining to ocean) drainage basisns
[2023-12-08 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: It's probably too big a change, but you could imagine that the upheaveal of the Yuvanti mountains /plaguelands disrupted the Istaros watershed and that actually the northern and southern halves are not connected
[2023-12-08 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: So the Andonne drains into the plaguelands but the Drogar and Kulthul rivers actually originate in the plaguelands or even the southern borders, ratehr than the Istaros actually flowing through
[2023-12-08 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: this isn't the right place for it. the dunmari basin, however, potentially is, if the hara is disconnected
[2023-12-08 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: which it might be. haven't decided yet
[2023-12-08 03:05 PM] rsulfuratus: would potentially create an interesting seasonal wetlands east of the yuvanti when the monsoon rains cause the hara to flood
[2023-12-08 03:05 PM] rsulfuratus: similar to some areas in southern sahara or the kalahari
[2023-12-08 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: actually that's very similar to the Otavangi (sp) delta in Namibia/Botswana
[2023-12-08 03:05 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-12-08 03:06 PM] rsulfuratus: did you push anything btw? I have like 10 minutes until my next meeting
[2023-12-08 03:06 PM] Deciusmus: no, I got distracted 
    (a) thinking about rewriting Geo of taelgar
    (b) fixing unit tests for work
[2023-12-08 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: i
[2023-12-08 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: I've been thinking about endorheic basins a lot. a little less than 20% of earths surface is endorheic, and they tend to require desert-like conditions to persist
[2023-12-08 03:09 PM] rsulfuratus: because otherwise the water just cuts through the barrier eventually
[2023-12-08 03:09 PM] rsulfuratus: so e.g. the mahar is probably not a great place, there is too much water flowing through it
[2023-12-08 03:09 PM] rsulfuratus: but there is also likely a large endorheic basin in the great desert area
[2023-12-08 03:09 PM] Deciusmus: should have figured you would have read the wikipedia page already given your previously stated river basin obesssion
[2023-12-08 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: equivalent to chad basin in north africa
[2023-12-08 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: the thing taelgar really lacks is something like the giant himalayas / caspian sea basin
[2023-12-08 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: yeah. the sentinals are fascinating because they have no large plateau around them. I don't think there is a good analoge on earth except maybe parts of the andes
[2023-12-08 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: but they really just kinda push up from nowhere. clear evidence of no plate tectonics
[2023-12-08 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: 🙂
[2023-12-08 03:12 PM] rsulfuratus: they are kind of rockies-inspired imo
[2023-12-08 03:12 PM] Deciusmus: yeah but the rockies have 1000 miles of high plateau behind them
[2023-12-08 03:12 PM] Deciusmus: maybe not quite 1000, but a lot
[2023-12-08 03:15 PM] Deciusmus: I tend to think of the Sembaran rivers as somewhat analogous to the India/Ganges river valley
[2023-12-08 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: you have this wall-like set of mountains that arises out of almost flat land
[2023-12-08 03:16 PM] rsulfuratus: really? then why are they called the highland kingdoms?
[2023-12-08 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: they are like "lowland" nepal or bhutan or the highland indian provinces
[2023-12-08 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: but they are pretty small
[2023-12-08 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: maybe that's wrong, I haven't thought about it super-carefully
[2023-12-08 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: To me the Sembara river systems imply a pretty rugged hilly uplands
[2023-12-08 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: you need spines of high terrain separting the river valleys
[2023-12-08 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: otherwise you'd end up with Dunmar with just the Hara in the middle
[2023-12-08 03:20 PM] rsulfuratus: doesn't have to be mountains but Sembara does not seem like a flat plain to me
[2023-12-08 03:22 PM] Deciusmus: what keeps the seine/loire/rhein/elbe as separate rivers?
[2023-12-08 03:23 PM] rsulfuratus: hah that is just the map I was looking at
[2023-12-08 03:25 PM] rsulfuratus:

[2023-12-08 04:22 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure what you have planned in the north, but it probably makes more sense to split the "Northern Green Sea" from the "Far North"
[2023-12-08 04:23 PM] Deciusmus: Boundary would be a bit fuzzy but it would distinguish the stuff north west of Vostok and especially on the western side of the Sentinels from Ursk and the mountains north of Urks
[2023-12-08 04:41 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, I think that makes sense
[2023-12-08 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: Far North might not quite be the right title but the north coast of the green sea (extending from "Kenku Homeland" east to "Far North Peninsula") is definitely distinct from Pandar/Forest of Nightmares area
[2023-12-08 04:47 PM] Deciusmus: Realistically, there are probably 3 regions up there, the "northern green sea", the "far north" (which is basically polar/artcic regions), and the "north coast" or "north west" which includes forest of nightmares/pandar and the farther north coast
[2023-12-08 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed some stuff to  a branch, geoupdates
[2023-12-08 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: not sure how I feel about it
[2023-12-08 06:22 PM] rsulfuratus: a few things are misclassified but I basically like it. I was about to do something similar. my one major modification would be to keep things that are unmapped* in tentative
[2023-12-08 06:23 PM] rsulfuratus: by unmapped I mean things like "far north peninsula" or "north bay"
[2023-12-08 06:23 PM] rsulfuratus: features that exist basically as coastline
[2023-12-08 06:24 PM] rsulfuratus: i would also keep the southern continent and related in either brainstorming or tentative
[2023-12-08 06:25 PM] rsulfuratus: the only unmapped feature I'd include in the main gazetteer is the ~great desert~
[2023-12-08 06:29 PM] Deciusmus: Feel free to take over my branch or merge it and go from their
[2023-12-08 06:30 PM] Deciusmus: I thought the “there were two continents during hkar age” was canonical
[2023-12-08 06:30 PM] rsulfuratus: either there were two continents or there was one continent that was split in two during the downfall
[2023-12-08 06:30 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure yet
[2023-12-08 06:32 PM] Deciusmus: Ah. Makes sense
[2023-12-08 06:46 PM] rsulfuratus: I am generally aiming to set river whereabouts to the watershed they are part of (although technically "partOf" is probably better here, but since that is all up the air not switching over yet). the aim being to make it easy to query a set of connected rivers. not sure how far I'll get tonight
[2023-12-08 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: What do you think about Zimka for the name of the highlanders? Zimkovia becomes the land
[2023-12-08 08:57 PM] rsulfuratus: Tentative 👍
[2023-12-08 08:58 PM] Deciusmus: alternate ideas:  Vemkya and Vemkysk
[2023-12-08 08:58 PM] Deciusmus: vem-ky-sk
[2023-12-08 08:59 PM] Deciusmus: or Vemkinsky
[2023-12-08 08:59 PM] Deciusmus: don't like that as much
[2023-12-08 09:00 PM] Deciusmus: Zimka is intended to be evolved from Semb
[2023-12-08 09:05 PM] Deciusmus: very explicitly same root as Vostok could be 
    Pemvos (the people of the Semb) Pemvora
    also could use Kemvos Semvos Kambvos
[2023-12-08 09:06 PM] Deciusmus: (Kem is already a river in Vostok so probably not that)
