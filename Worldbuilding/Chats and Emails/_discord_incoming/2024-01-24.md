# Discord DM – 2024-01-24

[2024-01-24 10:04 AM] Deciusmus: fyi, I did have a dataview replacer working at one point, but it didn't seem to work well with the string format stuff -- for some reason the metadata wasn't flowing correctly
[2024-01-24 10:04 AM] Deciusmus: but I bet the standard datatable would work, if it seems work adding I can
[2024-01-24 01:45 PM] rsulfuratus: my main interest is in autogenerating index pages, and timelines, but I think staticifying dataview is a bit tricky here as it would require reintroducing the "pre-Obsidian" file cleanup step
[2024-01-24 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: (although not for the mirror visions, specifically)
[2024-01-24 01:47 PM] rsulfuratus: although I guess with decent page filters the timeline stuff might not be too cluttered
[2024-01-24 04:43 PM] Deciusmus: Why would it require the clean? My code:
    Takes all dataview code blocks
    Calls a dataview api to turn them into markdown
    Replaces the block with the markdown
[2024-01-24 04:44 PM] Deciusmus: The problem I ran into is that the string formats were always blank but I never figured out why
[2024-01-24 04:44 PM] Deciusmus: But I think it worked fine for regular dataview (as opposed to dataviewjs) pages
[2024-01-24 04:45 PM] Deciusmus: The only real downside is
    Time during prep-for-export
    You need to wrap stuff you don’t want on the web with campaign:none
[2024-01-24 05:06 PM] rsulfuratus: the true secrets wouldn't be in the copy of the file that is staticified since my DM directory isn't shared. but there are a lot of little fiddly things like a bunch of events on npc pages. but like I said with careful page filtering it might not matter
[2024-01-24 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: certainly for the list of mirror visions a dataview replacer would be  useful
[2024-01-24 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: All I'm really saying is that
    (a) I had the code in a branch
    (b) it didn't work with dataviewjs correctly, and I didn't feel like trying to fix it
    (c) so I gave up
    (d) but it did work with regular dataview stuff
    (e) so if having the prep-for-export replace regular dataview stuff with a markdown table would be useful, I could dust off the code
[2024-01-24 07:01 PM] rsulfuratus: Yes, didn’t realize you had it working. That would be useful
[2024-01-24 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: Pushed a change
[2024-01-24 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: it will make ```dataview``` blocks static (but not ```dataviewjs``` blocks
[2024-01-24 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: you can turn it off by setting staticify_dataview: false in website.json
[2024-01-24 08:30 PM] Deciusmus: it adds very little time as it only processes files with dataview blocks
