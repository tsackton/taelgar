# Discord DM – 2025-10-31

[2025-10-31 01:55 PM] rsulfuratus: so after experimenting more this week, my overall opinion is:
    
    (1) codex/copilot works great for adding initial text for stubs or empty staging notes. i generally try to work in batches of 10-20 so i don't fill up local memory. 
    
    (2) codex/copilot works great for rewriting, reformatting, or extending or adding to a specific note when prompted with particular details (e.g., search dm notes and add a dm section in `%%` tags with any relevant information about this place/person/etc that is not in the current text). this does not work very well in batches and often needs interactive work. 
    
    however, i have had generally bad luck with trying to do (2) in batches or in an automated way. it sometimes works okay but is not reliably good.
[2025-10-31 02:00 PM] rsulfuratus: my current plan is to start by just trying to add text for all stubs and staging notes. 
    
    there are ~300 stubs and another few hundred notes in staging (some of which have text)
[2025-10-31 02:01 PM] rsulfuratus: i haven't looked carefully at how many notes in staging or stubs depend on cleenseau details for filling out, but the codex prompt is generally pretty good at just leaving a `%%` no information `%%` comment if it can't find stuff to add
[2025-10-31 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: (i realize that you have prep for your game and the one shot...)
[2025-10-31 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: I haven't had a ton of time, but did make a good start on getting Copilot to update Kiya's session notes with names, and to prompt me with a list like...
    
    "the lady" and "the halfling merchant" and then I tell it names and it updates.
    
    which goes a long way towards have stub-fill-in-material.
[2025-10-31 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: i've also been working on grabbing emails from my email archive and dumping raw emails, which has a lot of stuff as well
[2025-10-31 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: but I haven't gotten far and do need to spend some time on session prep
[2025-10-31 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: Although I'm not really expecting the one-shot to need much prep for next week as it's just session zero. But I want a bit prepared in case session 0 stuff goes quick
[2025-10-31 02:04 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-10-31 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: if you are trying to auto-fll stubs I should push my work in progress
[2025-10-31 02:05 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah if you have anything that would be useful, it would be helpful
[2025-10-31 02:05 PM] Deciusmus: I do, need 30 min but can push in a bit
[2025-10-31 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed
[2025-10-31 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: the raw emails are a lot; the session note cleanup less good
[2025-10-31 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: but with very few exceptions, i think NPC stubs from cleenseau have notes either in emails, session notes, or the worldbuilding\staging\cleenseau at this point; the trickiest bit is the staging stuff is not all canon
[2025-10-31 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: main exceptions I can think of would be the Merriweathers and any fey
[2025-10-31 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that is hard for AI to tell but hence the status/check/ai tag. i often have been just copying big blocks of unclear things or dm-ish brainstorming to a comment block at the end
