[2025-08-08 05:12 PM] rsulfuratus: based on this from ChatGPT, i'm inclined to make the Aursen bridged by 1750, but not the Massance.
    
    Would bridges have been built?
    
    Masance crossing – Historically, wide, shallow, flood-prone rivers like the Masance are poor candidates for permanent medieval bridges. Examples:
    
    River Allier, France – Stone bridges rare until the 18th c., as shifting channels undermined piers; crossings were seasonal ferries or fords.
    
    Trent at Wilden Ferry, England – A ford in summer, ferry in winter until a toll bridge was built in the 18th c. to serve coal traffic.
    
    Po near Cremona, Italy – Pontoon bridges used in some seasons; dismantled during floods.
    This suggests the Masance is still a ford/ferry site even 70 years later unless a wealthy patron invested heavily. A bridge here would be a huge logistical project—stone piers would need cofferdams and constant dredging, so in a low-tax, frontier area, ferries remain likely.
    
    Aursen crossing – Narrower, higher gradient, and a known settlement. Historical parallels:
    
    Ponte della Maddalena, Tuscany – High single-arch span over a mountain river.
    
    Pont Valentré, Cahors, France – Fortified bridge with tolls, part of regional defense.
    
    Monnow Bridge, Wales – Small fortified bridge controlling entry to a walled town.
    This suggests the Aursen could plausibly have a fortified stone bridge by “present day” (funded by tolls) — especially if Aurbez or another polity wanted better control over road trade.

[2025-08-08 05:16 PM] rsulfuratus: which of 1, 2, 3, 4 do you imagine are highlands? and is there anything missing?

[2025-08-08 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: All of those are highlands I think
[2025-08-08 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe only half of 4
[2025-08-08 05:19 PM] rsulfuratus: but the idea is you go from steep cliffs above the plains in 4 and maybe part of 1 & 2, to a more gentile rise
[2025-08-08 05:19 PM] rsulfuratus: ?
[2025-08-08 05:19 PM] Deciusmus: I was originally thinking of the Aurbez plateau as kind like the Mogollon Rim in Sedona area - a pretty dramatic and step ridge, almost mesa-like in places, although not everywhere
[2025-08-08 05:19 PM] Deciusmus: Yes I exactly
[2025-08-08 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: 4 and parts of 2 are the steepest, although there needs to be a gentle slope somewhere around 1 or south part of two as that’s where the wildcat miners come from the mountains with goods to Laicon.
[2025-08-08 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: / aussons crossing
[2025-08-08 05:24 PM] Deciusmus: Although in modern day maybe plenty of traders go south and then turn north.
[2025-08-08 05:29 PM] rsulfuratus: okay. i may try to draw this out on a hex map at some point (the exact details might be important)
