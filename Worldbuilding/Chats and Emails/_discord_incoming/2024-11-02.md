# Discord DM – 2024-11-02

[2024-11-02 11:38 AM] Deciusmus: do you have any opinions on what a "culture" header would look like?
[2024-11-02 11:39 AM] Deciusmus: is there much/any value beyond the name?
[2024-11-02 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus: I can’t think of anything obvious, unless we want to connect to language somehow? Or religion? But that seems kind of annoying to code in frontmatter
[2024-11-02 11:48 AM] Deciusmus: the only thing I thought could be useful was partOf/species
[2024-11-02 11:51 AM] Deciusmus: i.e.

[2024-11-02 11:53 AM] Deciusmus: perhaps even:

[2024-11-02 11:54 AM] Deciusmus: although I'm not sure the whereabouts is really worth it
[2024-11-02 12:08 PM] Deciusmus: I'm going to push a change that does 2 things:
    
    (a) makes "culture" a new page type, so that a tag of "culture" doesn't cause an unknown page
    (b) special cases whereabouts for culture to not be dynamic. I think the use case is very low there and it looks funny to have 2 lines. 
    (c) makes the default display line for culture be: boxInfo: "`<partOf:AU>` `<species:AU>` `<typeOf:AU>` `<(based in )whereabouts>`" 
    
    The website version should work but I haven't tested it much.
[2024-11-02 12:09 PM] Deciusmus: I did test that a culture page wins over an alias for a ancestry tag.
    
    So if we say added a "Sembaran" culture page all the humans with ancestry: Sembaran would (if the header was regenerated) link to the Sembaran culture page rather than the Sembara geopolitical page
[2024-11-02 01:39 PM] rsulfuratus: Was driving Isaac to district chorus auditions. I think this is good
