# Discord DM – 2025-01-17

[2025-01-17 08:42 AM] rsulfuratus: pushed a bunch of stuff last night and this morning. i have a bunch of scattered 30 minute meetings today so probably won't be particularly coherent for extended discussion but will likely be slowly working on note cleanup throughout the day. will try to pull before doing any editing and push before going back to a meeting so as to avoid merge conflicts. my main goal is to turn everything that is shared,tim into joint or none depending on context, so those are the main notes i'll work on
[2025-01-17 08:44 AM] rsulfuratus: my general interpretation has been that dm_notes should be used for private/non-shared notes, and if the only notes are shared, i've been setting dm_notes: none and status/cleanup/external
[2025-01-17 08:50 AM] Deciusmus: to the extent I'm doing stuff today I'm trying to pull in emails
[2025-01-17 09:29 AM] Deciusmus: I don't think I will update status much
[2025-01-17 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus: doing a bit of cleanup of mos numena gods - Kiya has really done a lot of nice worldbuilding around ordinary people's experience of the divine. 
    
    it would be nice to perhaps pick a few of those stories to share as sources in primary sources, with her permission.
[2025-01-17 10:08 AM] Deciusmus: I’ll ask her. She was happy for me to publish them on my version of taelgarverse
[2025-01-17 11:16 AM] rsulfuratus: found a tool to download discord chat history. added entire dm log to Worldbuilding/External for ease of searching. it is a text file (too many random ``<` and `#` to convert to markdown easily) for now
[2025-01-17 11:16 AM] Deciusmus: I was just doign the same thing!
[2025-01-17 11:16 AM] rsulfuratus: also have an html with all the images but the image directory is fairly big
[2025-01-17 11:25 AM] Deciusmus: the discord log is actually mostly discussion of obsidian and git workflows, not actual worldbuilding
[2025-01-17 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus: how should I tag dm notes when all my dm notes are in a secret on the note itself?
[2025-01-17 11:31 AM] Deciusmus: I'd say none
[2025-01-17 11:31 AM] Deciusmus: the fact that the secret is present is obvious
[2025-01-17 01:40 PM] Deciusmus: kiya happy for you to publish whatever of the celyn stories
[2025-01-17 02:05 PM] Deciusmus: The git plugin for obisidian is kinda nice
[2025-01-17 02:05 PM] Deciusmus: you can annotate a file so it shows who chnaged which bits
[2025-01-17 02:05 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-0D505.png]]
[2025-01-17 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: it is just "Git" with ~1m downloads?
[2025-01-17 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2025-01-17 02:09 PM] Deciusmus: you have to run the command to toggle author info
![[../_discord_assets/image-761AC.png]]
[2025-01-17 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: I think we should get rid of needswork/shared in general
[2025-01-17 02:21 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah was just thinking that
[2025-01-17 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: "old" is probably right for say elves
[2025-01-17 02:21 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-01-17 04:25 PM] Deciusmus: are you doing any scraping from discord chat log at the moment? I added a "discord-log-edits" where I extract the stuff I've moved to a Discord Chat - Topic note
[2025-01-17 04:26 PM] rsulfuratus: ah good to know. i made a few notes, on dwarven and hkaran calander
[2025-01-17 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: I saw that; I chopped them out of my tracking doc
[2025-01-17 04:27 PM] Deciusmus: I might spend an hour trying to organize brainstorming/email/discord/etc around topics, i.e. make a 
    
    Brainstorming/Calendars and pull everything that isn't canonical into it
[2025-01-17 04:31 PM] rsulfuratus: i was just working on that for climate
[2025-01-17 04:32 PM] rsulfuratus: worldbuilding could use a little cleanup, actually
[2025-01-17 04:34 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. for calendar stuff i added links in a comment in the Calendar Eras main page to a handful of calendar brainstorming notes
[2025-01-17 04:34 PM] rsulfuratus: for climate i tried to dump a bunch of emails and some of my old notes/wind maps into one doc
[2025-01-17 04:41 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking it might be useful to have folders under brainstorming to organize stuff
[2025-01-17 04:41 PM] Deciusmus: i.e.

[2025-01-17 04:41 PM] rsulfuratus: I have no strong opinions on brainstorming organization if you want to mess around
[2025-01-17 04:51 PM] Deciusmus: What do you think about keeping around brainstorming material that has been incorporated into a note?
[2025-01-17 04:51 PM] Deciusmus: my opinion is to just delete it
[2025-01-17 04:51 PM] Deciusmus: But I'm not sure
[2025-01-17 04:53 PM] rsulfuratus: i kind of like being able to see how we came to a certain decision without having to dig in the git history. 
    
    but it depends on the context. this is mostly true for things where the brainstorming doc has a lot of back and forth or captures an old email.
    
    i might just mark it as "`%%` Incorporated into [[note]]"
[2025-01-17 04:54 PM] rsulfuratus: perhaps we need a Brainstorming/Archive folder
[2025-01-17 04:54 PM] Deciusmus: In this case, I pulled the Google Docs version of the Calendar Ideas into obisidian and split it up into dwarven/elven/hkar/drankorian brainstorming pages
[2025-01-17 04:54 PM] Deciusmus: The elvish note was:
    
    Elves fundamentally simply count ka. Nothing is really super-fixed within a ka, but ka are very regular. I kind of feel there is maybe something a bit fey here? Like the elves care more about the cycles of extraplanar energy and the waxing and waning of Aldanor’s influence than the sun. Maybe even call parts of each cycle Aldanor waxing or Elmerica waning. In some sense years are probably more analogous to months for humans, seasons are weeks, and there is no real sense of anything between a day and a season as being important to track.
[2025-01-17 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: Which is fairly similar to what ended up in the main calendar eras page and I wasn't sure that the note was worth keeping
[2025-01-17 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: I like keeping the discord chat logs
[2025-01-17 04:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i would just keep that. what is the benefit of deleting? i think there is actually some useful context in being able to check that because we often "clean up" ideas to read more like a wikipedia article for publication but having the more informal presentation can be useful to get a vibe
[2025-01-17 04:56 PM] Deciusmus: ok, I guess no real benefit in deleting in this case
[2025-01-17 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: what about cases where the text was basically just copied and pasted into another doc?
[2025-01-17 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: that i'd delete
[2025-01-17 08:33 PM] Deciusmus: I’m almost done with processing the discord chat log. Will probably finish tomorrow as Dana is working
[2025-01-17 08:33 PM] Deciusmus: Might spend some time trying to reorganize brainstorming over tomorrow as well
