# Discord DM – 2024-01-09

[2024-01-09 09:41 AM] rsulfuratus: done, sorry didn't see this last night
[2024-01-09 01:42 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a page documenting slight changes to status/ and descriptive tags
[2024-01-09 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: both tagged status/tim, review when you get a chance and let me know
[2024-01-09 04:45 PM] rsulfuratus: haven't had a chance to read this stuff yet but did poke around a little bit about alternative website options, and wondering if you have opinions. 
    
    Option 1: Quartz
    https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/
    JavaScript React-style static site generator
    Pros: 
    - understands Obsidian markdown natively so can go from processed vault ->` html directly as a Github Action
    - includes decent search, backlinks, popover previews, a number of other nice features
    - heavily used in the Obsidian community if r/obsidianmd is accurate
    Cons:
    - written in TypeScript so fancy customization requires writing TypeScript (e.g., getting Leaflet to work or something)
    - does not have nearly the ecosystem of themes and plugins that other static site generators have
    
    Option 2: Material for mkdocs, Hugo, Jekyll or another "big" static site generator
    https://github.com/collections/static-site-generators
    Pros:
    - usually have big communities, lots of themes/plugins, comprehensive documentation for setting up on Github Pages
    - similar to the build process for my lab website so have some experience with this setup
    
    Cons:
    - would require some markdown cleanup to convert obsidian-flavored markdown to something else, including injection of backlinks and other 'obsidian-ish' content worth preserving
    - requires some searching/optimizing to figure out the best option among a number of possibilities
    
    Option 3: Obsidian
[2024-01-09 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: oops
[2024-01-09 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: Option 3 coming
[2024-01-09 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: Option 3: Obsidian Digital Garden
    something like https://dg-docs.ole.dev/
    Pros:
[2024-01-09 04:48 PM] rsulfuratus: Pros:
    - build entirely as an obsidian plugin; potentially supports dataview and other complex things like that
    
    Cons:
    - build entirely as an obsidian plugin, so it can be kind of annoying to modify, extend, etc.
[2024-01-09 04:48 PM] rsulfuratus: Another con:
    - requires tagging notes to be published
[2024-01-09 05:00 PM] Deciusmus: On a quick peak, Quartz seems promising
[2024-01-09 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: I don't love a solution inside obsidian, as I suspect it is the hardest to make work, and is probably highly tied to the obsidian UI
[2024-01-09 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: Typescript is just Javascript with some nice bits, so it is not a stretch from the existing script code-base
[2024-01-09 05:08 PM] Deciusmus: Quartz also can use rehype/remark plugins although I don't know what that is
[2024-01-09 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: It might be worth looking at how hard getting something like leaflet to work is
[2024-01-09 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: Lots of good lore drops there.
[2024-01-09 08:21 PM] rsulfuratus: I thought you'd appreciate that
[2024-01-09 08:21 PM] Deciusmus: Helpful to know the stuff I know out of game in game 😀
[2024-01-09 09:02 PM] Deciusmus: Do you have anything canonical about dwarven coins?
[2024-01-09 09:03 PM] rsulfuratus: no
[2024-01-09 09:03 PM] rsulfuratus: only think semi-canonical is dwarven trade bars are stamped and marked to indicate a certain weight of gold or silver in standard sizes and are typically trusted/commonly used for large transactions
[2024-01-09 09:04 PM] Deciusmus: right, I've actually used that in my game as well
[2024-01-09 11:04 PM] rsulfuratus: looking at your Sembara coinage - in practice I feel like this is more trouble than it is worth, unless your players are much more interested in tracking minutiae than my players
[2024-01-09 11:06 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean it is fine to make up - I actually have some old notes on dwarven, dunmari, and chardonian coins - but i have never found it worth the trouble to actually use these in a game
