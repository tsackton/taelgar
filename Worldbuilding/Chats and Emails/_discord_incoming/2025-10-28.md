# Discord DM – 2025-10-28

[2025-10-28 08:50 AM] rsulfuratus: mostly finished addermarch cleanup with ai assist, goes pretty fast. added a new status tag, status/check/ai, for AI generated content that hasn't been reviewed so might have inaccuracies, most likely in the form of metagame details, less likely in the form of hallucinations
[2025-10-28 08:51 AM] rsulfuratus: also added my addermarch dm notes to `_dm_notes` (keeping the style of `_MoC, _scripts`, etc)
[2025-10-28 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus: trying to refine my prompts. pasting here for record-keeping:
    
    ```
    please examine all the notes in the Worldbuilding/Staging/Great Library/People directory. 
    
    for each note, add (1) metadata, (2) text, and (3) secrets/clues/DM info
    
    (1) metadata should follow the rules in `_MoC`, and in particular should  include, where possible: whereabouts, campaignInfo, species, gender, born, died, ancestry, dm_owner, dm_notes, tags. always set person and status/check/ai tags. other metadata can be set as appropriate, but don't add metadata that doesn't exist in other people notes or in the `_MoC` metadata format notes. 
    
    (2) text should be inferred only from mentions of the person in session notes, DM notes, or other links. do not invent details that cannot be reliably inferred from other notes or context. if no information can be inferred, add a comment (in `%%` tags) to this effect and tag as status/stub.
    
    (3) DM info / secrets should include any meta-game context, secret information from DM notes, various meta-game things. this should always be wrapped in comment tags (`%%`)
    ```
[2025-10-28 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus: it is kind of amazing how well it figures out yaml frontmatter. 
    
    e.g., literally only mention of Marcus Tuso in Obsidian is "A war council, with [[Marcus Tuso]], the human commander of the Voltara legion;"
    
    we get:
    
    ```
    ---
    tags: `[person, status/check/ai]`
    name: Marcus Tuso
    species: human
    gender: male
    whereabouts:
    - {type: home, location: Voltara}
    affiliations:
    - {org: Chardonian Legion, title: Commander of the Voltara Legion}
    campaignInfo:
    - {campaign: GL, type: met}
    dm_owner: none
    dm_notes: none
    ---
    ```
[2025-10-28 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus: Have a few meetings shortly but thinking that this process would be much more efficient with some more explicit templates. Eg for NPCs I feel like there are a few basic levels of detail we could make a markdown template for, and then ask copilot/conflux to pick the right template and update
[2025-10-28 11:15 AM] rsulfuratus: Generally for NPCs I tend to have the one-liner version (metadata, one sentence overview, maybe a picture), the moderate info version (several sentences of overview, maybe a text description, relationships, events/timeline), and the “important recurring NPC” with often several paragraphs of overview, important events, relationships, and sometimes things like backstory/context/story hooks/various things like that
[2025-10-28 11:16 AM] rsulfuratus: Any NPC might or might not have DM notes - personality, role playing tips, motivation or goals - but in my notes anyway these tend to be a little divorced from importance / detail
[2025-10-28 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus: I might try to push a few things to templates or MoC after my meetings
[2025-10-28 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed four templates - minimal, standard, recurring-high-detail, and historical
[2025-10-28 12:35 PM] Deciusmus: I haven't had a chance to really look at any of this
[2025-10-28 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: here is prompt for getting AI to use templates, we'll see if it works:
    
    ```
    please examine the directory "People/Addermanians". for each note, choose one of the four templates in _templates/markdown/people-* and reformat the note to fit the chosen template.
    
    use detail from the note itself as well as linked pages, backlinks, and other mentions of the person in session notes, _dm_notes, DM, or other places in the repository to fill in details.
    
    do not invent details that are not present in notes.
    
    do not include optional headers, metadata, or DM notes unless there is relevant information to include.
    
    all non-DM content should be written from an in-world perspective, using a Wikipedia-style tone.
    
    do not edit a note if it is already matches the appropriate template.
    
    add tag "status/check/ai" to all notes that are edited.
    ```
[2025-10-28 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: that's fine
[2025-10-28 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: just exploring right now
[2025-10-28 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus: it templating works might want to sychronize on details so we can have consistent style notes across campaigns
[2025-10-28 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus: but still definitely in testing phase right now
[2025-10-28 12:41 PM] Deciusmus: the one thing I'm trying to look at today is trying to clean up my DM notes....
    
    my obsidian notes are kinda a mess because I had some one-drive sync issues so I have 2 copies of some things, one in onedrive, one not
    
    But having a _dm_notes in git makes it easier.
    
    I have three kinds of DM notes:
    
    (a) random ideas about NPCs, namelists, towns, etc
    (b) stated monsters or dungeon notes
    (c) notes on plot and potential future events
    
    (c) is mostly all happened now and incorporated better in session notes.
    
    (b) is clearly _dm_notes although I don't actually have a ton of this stuff
    
    Should I put (a) in Worldbuilding/Staging, or _dm_notes?
[2025-10-28 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus: i have been kinda inconsistent about (a) stuff, tbh
[2025-10-28 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus: this is mostly in dm notes, but some of it is in worldbuilding/research and mechanics
[2025-10-28 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus: i think staging should only be for stuff introduced in play (or in canonical notes, e.g. some of the cosmology stuff) that is not yet created
[2025-10-28 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus: some of that stuff could go in brainstorming too
[2025-10-28 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus: (worldbuliding/brainstorming)
[2025-10-28 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus: but i'm not sure it really matters that much
[2025-10-28 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus: i do think dm notes should remain organized by campaign and not accumulate random non-campaign-linked notes, which definitely belong in worldbuilding
[2025-10-28 12:52 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-10-28 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: for example, I put together a document on Veltor that is part ChatGPT ideas, part my stuff, that I had open during the veltor adventures and that I used many of the bits from, but where I decided some of them I didn't like.
    
    I think putting that kind of thing in staging makes sense, in that it is my raw notes on veltor; I do need to incorporate into the main veltor note, at which point I'd delete it
[2025-10-28 12:54 PM] Deciusmus: I have a similar doc on people / npcs in veltor
[2025-10-28 12:54 PM] Deciusmus: but I also have a doc of random npc ideas from earlier adventures that explicitly didn't come up, i.e. I decided not to use them, so they no longer exist. Those probably belong in dm_notes, not staging
[2025-10-28 01:08 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, that makes sense
[2025-10-28 01:10 PM] rsulfuratus: i tend to use staging mostly when i'm writing session notes, to put stub links created during that process. but i don't think we need to be totally consistent and staging is a good place for "raw notes that are a mix of cannon and rejected about a place/person/thing/etc that definitely exists" too
[2025-10-28 01:11 PM] rsulfuratus: (e.g. some of my addermarch fey notes are more like this)
[2025-10-28 08:42 PM] rsulfuratus: experimenting a little more - so far works a lot better for creating blank notes than updating existing notes. probably a little prompt tuning would help here
