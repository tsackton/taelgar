[2024-01-31 05:56 PM] Deciusmus: I'm trying to clean up my Cleenseau NPCs because my players have started asking if random people they met 4 sessions ago are still around...
    
    So I was trying to find all the people who are in Cleenseau, includingthe people I've created without whereabouts...
    
    Do you have concerns if I set simple whereabouts on some people, i.e. 
    
    Adam Gower = Tollen
    Yelena = Ursk
    etc?
