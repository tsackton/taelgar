# Discord DM – 2023-11-20

[2023-11-20 09:38 AM] Deciusmus: what are your status tags again?
[2023-11-20 09:38 AM] Deciusmus: I've been trying to do minor cleanup in various short bits of time between meetings and such
[2023-11-20 09:56 AM] Deciusmus: Also there are few oddities…
    Is Illoria an archipelago in the Nevos Sea or a province (colony? realm?) of the Chardonian Empire?
[2023-11-20 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus: status tags are rough, but basically: 
    - stub = all information in obisidan, but not much to begin with
    - uptodate - all information in obsidian, feels roughly complete
    - needswork - needs some attention to sort out details
    - notes - information scattered elsewhere that needs to get into obsidion
    - draft - was working on something and stopped
    - refactor - page needs a rethink for some reason
[2023-11-20 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus: the distinction between stub/uptodate is a bit blurry
[2023-11-20 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus: as it the distinction between needswork/notes
[2023-11-20 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus: still refining these
[2023-11-20 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus: but generally, stub/uptodate for me means I don't need to check elsewhere or add detail for session prep
    notes means I need to check elsewhere for session prep
    needswork means I need to collate information either from notes or internally in obsidian
    draft/refactor are often reasonably complete but not in the format I want
[2023-11-20 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus: re: Illoria it is both the name of the archipelago and the name of the colony
[2023-11-20 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: not sure how to tag that
[2023-11-20 10:24 AM] Deciusmus: so probably there should be 2 pages in Gazetteer?
    
    Illoria (island) and Illoria
[2023-11-20 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah, probably
[2023-11-20 10:25 AM] Deciusmus: Illoria is a protectorate of the Chardonian Empire
    Illoira (archipelago ) is an archipelago in the Nevos Sea
[2023-11-20 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus: On separate topic, I’m debugging python code, I think I fixed most of the “original” bugs and will probably fiddle around with implementing some of the new features at some point, but would be helpful to have a handful of “fancy notes” that I can check against
[2023-11-20 10:33 AM] Deciusmus: I was thinking about that a bit
[2023-11-20 10:33 AM] Deciusmus: I don't like the testing notes because they clutter up dataview queries
[2023-11-20 10:33 AM] Deciusmus: I was thinking of adding a flag to particular complex notes:
    testCase: true
    
    or something
    
    to indicate real notes that have complex rules
[2023-11-20 10:34 AM] Deciusmus: and then we could test python/javascript correpondence on those
[2023-11-20 10:34 AM] Deciusmus: but I hadn't gotten very far on that
[2023-11-20 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah i don't like testing notes either
[2023-11-20 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus: that is a good idea
[2023-11-20 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus: testCase tag
[2023-11-20 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus: or frontmatter item
[2023-11-20 10:34 AM] Deciusmus: Some good ones are:
    
    Apollyon
    Scepter of Command
    Antonia
[2023-11-20 10:35 AM] Deciusmus: Hralgar
[2023-11-20 10:35 AM] Deciusmus: I like tag even better
[2023-11-20 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: Any objection to adding a headerVersion: yaml tag that is auto-generated from the header template generator?
[2023-11-20 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: seems like a nice way to track pages that just need header regen if/when we make significant changes to functionality
[2023-11-20 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus: no, that is good
[2023-11-20 10:58 AM] Deciusmus: it will insert at top of frontmatter
[2023-11-20 10:58 AM] Deciusmus: current version is 2023.11.20 will just use dates going forward
[2023-11-20 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: will update anytime the output of the header would change such that you'd want to regen a page that was using an older version
[2023-11-20 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: pushed
[2023-11-20 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus: # The Scepter of Command
    >``[!info]`+ Information

![[../_discord_assets/image-75650.png]]
[2023-11-20 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus: do you remember what you changed to get the "Created by:"
[2023-11-20 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus: fixed that
[2023-11-20 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus: I have the following pages as test cases, and so far all work in Python:
    - Antonia (person in object with whereabouts)
    - Apollyon (not sure what is complicated here)
    - Hralgar (not sure what is complicated here)
    - Mantle of Protection (follow location string at creation date, not current date)
    - Scepter of Command (use startStatus in whereabouts)
[2023-11-20 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus: if you see any other pages that have complicated whereabouts or page dated stuff, let me know
[2023-11-20 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: I also have Evelina (dead person location) and Belegor (origin/last known/current unknown), as test cases for general whereabouts handling
[2023-11-20 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed an update with those tagged testcase
[2023-11-20 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus: the build process is updated, so i'll also push an update with new website build instructions today
[2023-11-20 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: Apollyon is complicated as someone who's origin needs to be found by someone else
[2023-11-20 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. the scepter of command
[2023-11-20 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: The scepter of command's "created by:" having Drankor rather than unknown as the location is the key though
[2023-11-20 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus: ah. i was using mantle of protection as my test for that
[2023-11-20 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: Apollyon page itself not interesting
[2023-11-20 12:48 PM] Deciusmus: I was giving you that list from memory, just for cases I was fixing bugs in 🙂
[2023-11-20 12:49 PM] Deciusmus: But actually the data is a bit different
    
    Apollyon is currently set up with an *origin* at the create date of the item whereas Cloudspinner has a *home*
[2023-11-20 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: Hralgar is a test case for following "trapped in Stormcaller Tower" to add the Eastern Dunmar, Dunmar bits
[2023-11-20 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus: ah okay, that might not be working yet then
[2023-11-20 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus: because in my timeline his current location is floating on the storm
[2023-11-20 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: also are you doing something to reformat frontmatter? 
    I hate this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-59245.png]]
[2023-11-20 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus: obsidian does that randomly
[2023-11-20 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus: I don't know why
[2023-11-20 12:52 PM] Deciusmus: do you have properties set to source:
![[../_discord_assets/image-C39C2.png]]
[2023-11-20 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus: ah no, i was just looking to see if there was an option
[2023-11-20 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus: that is probably the issue
[2023-11-20 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: that is it
[2023-11-20 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: If you have "properties mode" set to visible it reformats when you add a property
[2023-11-20 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: it reformats any time you add a property not in source mode
[2023-11-20 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: right, that's what I meant
[2023-11-20 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: but changing the setting doesn't totally fix the issue because if you add a property in reading view it still messes things up
[2023-11-20 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: But I keep my obisidian  :
    * property mode: source
    * page mode: live preview
[2023-11-20 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2023-11-20 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: I just never use reading mode
[2023-11-20 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus: ah. i toggle source and reading, i don't use live preview much
[2023-11-20 12:56 PM] Deciusmus: That is also what strips your # comments
[2023-11-20 12:56 PM] Deciusmus: from yaml
[2023-11-20 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-11-20 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: that is very annoying, the file properties update to obsidian is generally not great imo
[2023-11-20 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2023-11-20 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: lots of complaints about it online, actually
[2023-11-20 12:58 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. https://forum.obsidian.md/t/make-new-properties-feature-not-re-format-frontmatter/66297
[2023-11-20 12:59 PM] Deciusmus: Do you have objections to me pushing a change that deletes _Testing and _templates ?
[2023-11-20 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus: no
[2023-11-20 01:00 PM] Deciusmus: btw dataview doesn't work well with git
[2023-11-20 01:00 PM] Deciusmus: if you do a git pull that changes files it doesn't reindex those files
[2023-11-20 01:00 PM] Deciusmus: or at least, not all of them
[2023-11-20 01:00 PM] rsulfuratus: if you quit and reopen obsidian its fine in my experience
[2023-11-20 01:01 PM] Deciusmus: yes I was about to say same
[2023-11-20 01:28 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a reorg of _MoC
[2023-11-20 01:29 PM] Deciusmus: to add a number of helper pages that find potentially wrong, etc stuff
[2023-11-20 01:29 PM] Deciusmus: Most revelevant is Needs Double-Checking specifically for pages where I am doing data cleanup but I'm not sure if it is canonical
[2023-11-20 01:30 PM] Deciusmus: The two key folders are:
    
    Data Quaility, which is for finding things to work on, basically
    Pages to Review, which  is mostly for reviewing each others changes
[2023-11-20 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, I pulled. i'm adding a few things. i have a links to check page with dangling links, unlinked pages, and linked pages in worldbuliding that should be reviewed for inclusion in gazetteer/elsewhere
[2023-11-20 01:54 PM] rsulfuratus: making a few small changes:
    - exclude worldbuilding from "Missing Tags"
    - sort missing partof by backlinks so highly linked incomplete pages show up first
    - sort missing tags by folder then backlinks
[2023-11-20 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: I assume we should just tag planes as places
[2023-11-20 02:28 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-11-20 02:32 PM] Deciusmus: what is the feywild partOf ? nothing? the multiverse? echo realms?
[2023-11-20 02:32 PM] rsulfuratus: echo realms
[2023-11-20 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: added website build instructions. it should work fine on pc paths but lmk if it throws an error
[2023-11-20 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: I will try it out soon,  maybe not today. I'm on a meeting, just only half paying attention and updating tags at the same time 🙂
[2023-11-20 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: any thoughts on tag categorization for religions and gods?
[2023-11-20 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: not developed thoughts. but I do think it would be useful to have a tag for each religion, to pull together all the bits and pieces. probably religion/mosnumena, religion/fivesiblings, etc
[2023-11-20 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: probably deity is fine as a general tag
[2023-11-20 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe deity/high, deity/incorporeal, deity/embodied
[2023-11-20 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: deity and religion seem like good starting spots
[2023-11-20 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: the divine order google doc has a lot of hierchary in it
[2023-11-20 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: I find it pretty easy to work in layers, i.e. set `[deity]` for now, which I can do easily, and then we can have a "single layer deity"  work page for more categorization
[2023-11-20 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: I've been doing:
    
    deity, religion/xxx
    sometimes setting:
    partOf: religion page
    affiliations: `[ species ]`
[2023-11-20 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. I added
    
    affiliations: `[orcs]` to Thark
    and 
    partOf: Five Siblings to Bishma
[2023-11-20 03:49 PM] rsulfuratus: Thinking a bit more about how to organize ambiguous places, things that are both a physical place and a political unit. Two relevant contexts:
    1) whereabouts for Deno’qai. I don’t really like tribe names for location; this should ideally be an actual location 
    2) Illoria - the partOf here should in some sense really be a whereabouts type line; associations between physical places and realms/cultures can vary in time
[2023-11-20 03:49 PM] rsulfuratus: Not sure I want to do any major reorg anytime soon
[2023-11-20 03:50 PM] Deciusmus: This is a tough one to tag:
![[../_discord_assets/image-D7308.png]]
[2023-11-20 03:50 PM] Deciusmus: on the place one, I agree it is a bit tricky
[2023-11-20 03:51 PM] rsulfuratus: Part of divine realm, religion/five siblings
[2023-11-20 03:56 PM] Deciusmus: I added three tags:
    
    species ->` used to tag individual pages for species
    
    meta ->` for random "about" pages that I wanted to exclude from the tag list, i.e. main.md, various pages that list events from other places, etc
    
    background ->` for "worldbuilding" type information that I didn't want to review to see if it should be moved
[2023-11-20 03:59 PM] Deciusmus: what I have left untagged is mostly history:
![[../_discord_assets/image-926EF.png]]
[2023-11-20 03:59 PM] Deciusmus: And Luminastra's Gift, which I guess I should just tag as item/play
[2023-11-20 05:16 PM] Deciusmus: is this right?
![[../_discord_assets/image-D1424.png]]
[2023-11-20 05:16 PM] Deciusmus: or do we want either (a) divine to not be in spiritual (b) heart of mountain to be directly in spiritual realm or (c) the page to have `<loc:2>`
[2023-11-20 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: Divine realms are a subset of spiritual realms
[2023-11-20 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: Not all subsets of spiritual realms have good names but everything that is associated with gods directly should be a divine realm, anything else directly tagged to spiritual realms
[2023-11-20 05:19 PM] rsulfuratus: Metaphysically realms of incorporeal and embodied gods are different but it is a bit too fuzzy at the moment to split up the divine realms yet
[2023-11-20 05:54 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm doing some cleanup while I generate tokens for game tomorrow, so try to push frequently to avoid having to deal with merge conflicts, if you are still working on stuff
[2023-11-20 05:56 PM] Deciusmus: I just pushed a bunch
[2023-11-20 06:24 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed some more but going to eat dinner shortly
[2023-11-20 08:03 PM] Deciusmus: Thinking about organization a bit while I was washing dishes....
    
    Ultimately, I think you *could* (but we definitely shouldn't) distinguish between:
    
    * Groups of people - which ultimately form large political units (Sembara, Chardon) and  cultures (Deno'qai, Highlander) and of course there is a mix
    * Places in the world that you could go to and that would exist even if all the people vanished
    
    The question really ends up being -- when do we
    (a) have a single page that covers the group and the place
    (b) have a different page for the group and the place
    
    Secondarily, the question is, what is the tag and partOf relationship chains?
    
    i.e. if there is one page, is it tagged place or organization, and separately, what is part of it?
[2023-11-20 08:05 PM] Deciusmus: Additionally, there is a separate question of how to model more complex relationships --
    
    For example, Western Cymea is
    (a) a place that is part of the Cymean Peninusula
    (b) a culture that is ruled by Tollen
    
    Or Illoria is separately
    (a) a place that is part of the Nevos Sea
    (b) a culture that is ruled by Chardon
[2023-11-20 08:05 PM] Deciusmus: A specific Deno'qai tribe isn't really part of the general Deno'qai tribe, though. Nor is the tribe part of something other than perhaps a larger deno'qai organization
[2023-11-20 08:08 PM] rsulfuratus: i think my feeling is that it is a little hard to know in the abstract. mostly, there aren't places that are both well developed as a geography, and well developed as a culture. we pretty much exclusively have one or the other
[2023-11-20 08:08 PM] Deciusmus: I think the answer is actually fairly straightforward in that we already have 3 types of relationships:
    
    (a) a smaller unit of (either in time, space, or organization). This is the partOf of relationship
    (b) a more specific kind of a general type. This is the typeOf relationship
    (c) a entity that controls another entity. This is the (little used so far) leaderOf relationship
[2023-11-20 08:10 PM] Deciusmus: There are two things the relationships are used for...
    (a) header generation
    (b) queries
    
    I think I'd model something like Western Cymea as 
    
    * partOf the Cymean Peninsula (which Cymea is also partOf)
    * a typeOf of realm
    * set the leaderOf on Tollen to say that Tollen is the leader of Western Cymea
[2023-11-20 08:11 PM] Deciusmus: maybe its all too complicated
[2023-11-20 08:11 PM] rsulfuratus: my gut reaction is overloading the leaderOf for modeling political relationships is frought
[2023-11-20 08:11 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, you could have a simpler ruledBy
[2023-11-20 08:11 PM] Deciusmus: or controlledBy or something
[2023-11-20 08:12 PM] Deciusmus: But I'm not sure why it is fraught, actually
[2023-11-20 08:12 PM] rsulfuratus: what I would probably do is overload whereabouts as ruled by
[2023-11-20 08:12 PM] rsulfuratus: leaderOf is trying to do something specific, it is trying to make it easy to go from fixed place to variable rulers
[2023-11-20 08:12 PM] Deciusmus: If you have a dataview table that reports all of the people in Tollen, someone in Western Cymea shouldn't show up though
[2023-11-20 08:13 PM] rsulfuratus: right, you probably need to call it something other than whereabouts, because it doesn't report location
[2023-11-20 08:13 PM] rsulfuratus: but it could use the same code logic
[2023-11-20 08:13 PM] Deciusmus: hence leaderOf 🙂
[2023-11-20 08:14 PM] Deciusmus: The difference is that whereabouts is a chain - you can only be in one spot at a time - whereabouts leaderOf is a one ->` many - you can be the leader of many things at a time
[2023-11-20 08:14 PM] rsulfuratus: but when you are working on the page for Western Cymea, you don't want to have to go to the Tollen page to edit Western Cymea's political relationships
[2023-11-20 08:14 PM] rsulfuratus: that is the other reason leaderOf is not the same as ruledBy
[2023-11-20 08:14 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, you might want the inverse of leaderOf, i.e. ruledBy
[2023-11-20 08:15 PM] Deciusmus: There is a simple version were ruledBy is just a link
[2023-11-20 08:15 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. ruledBy: Tollen
[2023-11-20 08:15 PM] Deciusmus: ruledBy: Chardon
[2023-11-20 08:16 PM] Deciusmus: and all it does is produce a second line:
    
    A protectorate in the Cymean Peninsula
    Ruled by Tollen
[2023-11-20 08:16 PM] Deciusmus: or whatever
[2023-11-20 08:16 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, you can just type that line manually as well, which is the simplest
[2023-11-20 08:17 PM] rsulfuratus: so I think my feeling is we've made a lot of organizational changes and information restructuring, and my inclination would be to conslidation information first before refactoring things again
[2023-11-20 08:17 PM] rsulfuratus: i've been using status/refactor for pages that have correct and up to date informaiton but there is something about them i don't quite like
[2023-11-20 08:18 PM] rsulfuratus: if we fill in content and get 10-15 of those, then it makes sense to think about generalization
[2023-11-20 08:18 PM] Deciusmus: This is coming up because I've been going through the "missing partOf" list
[2023-11-20 08:18 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2023-11-20 08:18 PM] rsulfuratus: I think for now I'd stick to geographic relationships where possible for partOf
[2023-11-20 08:18 PM] rsulfuratus: and keep ruled by relationships in the text
[2023-11-20 08:18 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I think that is basically what I am trying to say as well
[2023-11-20 08:19 PM] Deciusmus: if something is part of something else, it means it is a smaller piece of a larger thing of the same type
[2023-11-20 08:19 PM] rsulfuratus: tomorrow I am going to work on moving content from google docs, as there is a lot there that isn't in obsidian (and some in my old onenote docs); I think that will be informative as well as to where the current organization falls apart
[2023-11-20 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: Partly I was thinking about leader of because I want to fix the regnal stuff for Sembara
[2023-11-20 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: and I was wondering how far we might want to try to take it
[2023-11-20 08:31 PM] Deciusmus: but to keep it simple for now...
    
    (1) partOf should always be used for "same-type" relationships and also for "smaller-bigger" relationships.
    When something is a political unit (town, country, whatever) and it could have multiple partOf relationships, pick the "more permanent/important one" as long as it meets smaller ->` bigger rule
    (2) when a smaller group is a *kind* of thing, but the bigger thing is more of a category than a specific thing, prefer typeOf or ancestry to partOf
    (3) use whereabouts to denote current location to allow for boundary crossing - as long as the whereabouts is a thing that could be located in the world, makes sense
    (4) ruled by and similar relationships are just in the text
    
    Examples:
    the Sembaran Army is not part of Sembara - they are not the same type of thing, but it is whereabouts: Sembara
    the Ko'zula could be partOf Northern Deno'qai Tribes or they could be typeOf  - it probably doesn't matter a ton
    Western Cymea is not part of Tollen (it could be part of the Tollen Empire if it had been conqueored for 5 generations). It could be partOf the Cymean Peninusla or partOf the Western Green Sea
    Illoria is similarly not partOf Chardonian Empire, unless in game that is the most defining feature about it. 
    Some town in Mawar is part of the Mawar Confederacy which in turn is partOf the Mawakel Peninsula 
    A river in Mawakel might just be defined as partof Mawakel because in that case the physical relationship is more important
[2023-11-20 08:31 PM] Deciusmus: I am going to move Deno'qai to organizations, I think, because they really don't fit as places, unless you object
[2023-11-20 08:32 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that makes sense. all the forests have names, I just short-handed a lot of things as `<tribename>` village that should really have proper names to track
[2023-11-20 08:32 PM] rsulfuratus: but also I'm not sure they are really organizations
[2023-11-20 08:33 PM] rsulfuratus: they are a culture
[2023-11-20 08:33 PM] rsulfuratus: you wouldn't put Sembaran Army in ancestry, for example
[2023-11-20 08:34 PM] rsulfuratus: i've written the information about the deno'qai more like halfings / halfling families or dwarves / clans
[2023-11-20 08:35 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway, fine to move them around for now, folder organization isn't that critical, but i'd expect those pages would move around more
[2023-11-20 08:36 PM] rsulfuratus: it is just a quirk of worldbuilding that in the elderwood, the thing that was important and interesting in the game was the biome + the NPCs
[2023-11-20 08:36 PM] rsulfuratus: so the deno'qai settlement patterns never got invented
[2023-11-20 08:36 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway I need to help N so afk for a bit
[2023-11-20 08:39 PM] Deciusmus: Right on Deno'qai, a specific person would have an affiliation: `[ Ko'zula ]` and an ancestry: Deno'qai (or perhaps northern Deno'qai or southern Deno'qai)
    The page for the Ko'zula tribe itself would either have no relational tags (i.e. no partOf) and a typeOf of tribe or a partOf to Deno'qai or a subTypeOf: northern Deno'qai
[2023-11-20 08:52 PM] rsulfuratus: so, eventually, I think we need to have culture pages, that are neither places nor organizations. the model for something like the Deno'qai would be like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts
[2023-11-20 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i think in the end it is totally fine if there is a culture page for Deno'qai but not other human cultures, there are some place pages that have multiple meanings (Sembara is both a realm, a region, and a culture), and some places where there are separate physical and political pages (Mawar vs Mawakel)
[2023-11-20 09:57 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I think “culture” pages are fine. In theory that’s what “ancestry” is about so it would even link nicely
[2023-11-20 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus: if you want to try chatGPT plus, I just got a referal link: chat.openai.com/invite/2CB1FD664
