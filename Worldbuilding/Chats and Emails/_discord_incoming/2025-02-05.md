[2025-02-05 11:49 AM] Deciusmus: btw, I assume idea of Amberglow was meant to harken back to the Lantern of the Bright Hearth, i.e. likely Aerlios made it out of Amberglow or it in some fashion has some relationship to Amberglow
[2025-02-05 01:27 PM] rsulfuratus: Amberlights, yes
[2025-02-05 01:27 PM] rsulfuratus: the Lantern is not itself an Amberlight, but the vibe was inspired by it
[2025-02-05 01:27 PM] rsulfuratus: i liked your midjourney image so ran with it
[2025-02-05 01:29 PM] rsulfuratus: Aelirios presumably was one of the fey lords who had an amberlight and used it to do things
[2025-02-05 01:29 PM] rsulfuratus: the idea is supposed to be a way for the refuges and defenses of amberglow to hang on without Cloudspinner's direct power
[2025-02-05 01:29 PM] rsulfuratus: (of course eventually they all went dark)
[2025-02-05 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: Right. So Robin's lantern could be an echo of an echo, i.e. like how the phial of Galadriel is an echo of an echo of the light of the Simarils
