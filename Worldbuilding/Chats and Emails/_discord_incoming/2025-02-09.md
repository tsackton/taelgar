[2025-02-09 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus: i am getting a little carried away with feywild stuff, which i'm planning on pushing tonight and updating taelgarverse in prep for session thursday. 
    
    a lot of the detail i'm writing is an expansion of the lore recorded by Ulfgar Frostbeard in his book, The Lore of the Feywild. 
    
    currently, i'm writing this mostly on the note for The Lore of the Feywild itself, with some minor details/repetition on realm pages. 
    
    i think this is consistent with just getting rid of primary sources as a category and trying to move the stuff there (eventually) into the relevant directories (e.g., religion, species, etc) but curious if you have other thoughts here
