# Discord DM – 2023-08-08

[2023-08-08 05:15 PM] Deciusmus: Can you send the chat gpt link over discord or email? Being a non mac user I cant see imessage on my computer
[2023-08-08 05:16 PM] Deciusmus: But in general I think the idea is great, my only thought would be to emphasize the local miracle holidays as well, i.e. if there are 4 holidays on the calendar they shouldn't all be these "generic domain" holidays
[2023-08-08 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: And I also wouldn't worry about balance or precision, i.e. there is no reason why there has to be one "generic" holiday for each divine, I suspect that these "generic" holidays would probably mostly be quite ancient and harken back to Drankor or even H'kar, although people wouldn't necessarily know that
[2023-08-08 05:41 PM] Deciusmus: And not ever ancient holiday from Drankor surived. But the domain holidays would tend to be the ones that *everyone* celebrated in some fashion across the wide set of Mos Numena traditions.
[2023-08-08 05:42 PM] rsulfuratus: didn't see this
[2023-08-08 05:42 PM] rsulfuratus: here is chatgpt for holidays: https://chat.openai.com/share/ea580bc3-e320-4fea-94ac-87513e5bf956
[2023-08-08 05:42 PM] rsulfuratus: here is chatgpt for elves: https://chat.openai.com/share/f56a8fd6-3e7f-4ae9-9289-7ab8b69fabdb
[2023-08-08 05:43 PM] rsulfuratus: agree about not needing balance. I only make up holidays for background for current events in the campaign so all I care about now is a winter holiday in Tollen
[2023-08-08 05:43 PM] Deciusmus: On holidays, I really liked the basic idea for Twilight Revelry, Travelers Vigil, and Benevlonet Shaows
[2023-08-08 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: I'm quite interested in the holidays topic because my game is currently mid-Nov, and the next session is going to be a minor events/roleplaying/downtime that time skips through the winter
[2023-08-08 05:45 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm working on Twilight Revelry now - basic idea is that in Drankor this was the "day between the years" when everything is upended, people party, and social norms are cast aside, kind of like Saturnalia + Carnivale. Key thing being masks, parades, feasting, probably riddle contests/games of chance
[2023-08-08 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: So having a holiday or two to provide some focus would be perfect
[2023-08-08 05:46 PM] rsulfuratus: in Sembara/Tollen celebrated on Dec 31st.
[2023-08-08 05:46 PM] Deciusmus: I think having 4 major winter holidays doesn't feel right, so I want to use twlight relvery + 1 more at most
[2023-08-08 05:46 PM] rsulfuratus: I think Traveler's Vigil, Benevolent Shadows also great - wouldn't necessarily bunch everything up though
[2023-08-08 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: benevolent shadows idea doesn't need any reason to be winter-associated
[2023-08-08 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: could have traveler's vigil and twilight revelry as major "universal-ish" winter holidays
[2023-08-08 05:47 PM] Deciusmus: No, although traveler's vigil doesn't either, although just for metagame reasons I like it better (one of my PCs is a paladin of the wanderer so I think he'd appreciate that holiday a bit more)
[2023-08-08 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: What is traveler's vigil wasn't the solistce but the last full moon before the solistce or something like that. Would space it out a bit more from Twilight and also potentially leave open the solistice
[2023-08-08 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: In the real world, holidays do sometimes bunch up -- think Rosh Hashanah / Yom Kippur / Sukkot
[2023-08-08 05:50 PM] Deciusmus: So I could imagine, say, Vigil is moon-aspected (full or new) and in winter, but before the solstice. The solstice is not a big deal in Mos Numena, but some highland kingdoms might celebrate a kestavo-inspired type thing, and then twilight relevery comes at new years
[2023-08-08 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah I like that
[2023-08-08 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: Mos Numena originally founded in tropical/subtropical area
[2023-08-08 05:52 PM] rsulfuratus: So solstice maybe not a big deal in drankor particularly
[2023-08-08 05:52 PM] Deciusmus: Right, winter solistce not a big deal in Drankor/H'kar --
[2023-08-08 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: actually having Traveler's Vigil on the last new moon of the year would be perfect for the timing of my game
[2023-08-08 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: The current date is Dec 4th and in 1719 the last new moon is Dec 6th
[2023-08-08 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: last full moon in 1719 is Dec 20th, so actually that works as well
[2023-08-08 05:55 PM] rsulfuratus: I think makes more sense as full moon
[2023-08-08 05:55 PM] rsulfuratus: But doesn’t really matter
[2023-08-08 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: In Sembara (and probably Tollen, and other places where winter weather is bad for travel) I was thinking it would be a bit of a marking point in the year -- it is unluckly for travelers to not be home by then, unless they were not coming home for the winter at all, in which case it would be a tradition to send them prayers. So a bit of a combination of celebration of homecoming and prayers for those not at all
[2023-08-08 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: not at home
[2023-08-08 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: The other idea would be to make it an auspicious time to begin a journey and move it to the summer or spring
[2023-08-08 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: Thinking about it more, I don't love the vibe of "tell us about your travels" as opposed to having an association with actual travel. ALthough hospitality is part of the wanderer as well
[2023-08-08 05:59 PM] rsulfuratus: Maybe the drankorian year actually ended on the solstice, and the days between the solstice and the new year were associated with magic and ritual and ended with the twilight revelry. Travelers Festival was the last holiday of the year and even back then had the same connotations, not because of weather but for mystical reasons
[2023-08-08 06:00 PM] rsulfuratus: But I also like association with beginning journeys
[2023-08-08 06:01 PM] Deciusmus: So a couple of ideas:
    
    * Spring time festival, mostly about being a time to start a journey / change in life / etc
    * Winter time, a time of homecoming
    * Winter time, with an association of both homecoming and hospitality -- so both a celebration for the returning travelers and a celebration of welcoming and hospitality and community, with some wassailing/giving food/etc connotations
[2023-08-08 06:01 PM] rsulfuratus: Or it could have been an auspicious time to start journeys in drankor but now has a different vibe
[2023-08-08 06:02 PM] Deciusmus: I think any of them could work, #2 feels like it makes it more minor, #3 feels like it would be big, which might overshadow twlight thingy, which might not be what you want
[2023-08-08 06:03 PM] rsulfuratus: I think 3 makes sense. It would have a bit of Christmas / new years vibe but I think that’s fine
[2023-08-08 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: Having holidays cluster makes them feel more real imo,
[2023-08-08 06:06 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-08-08 06:08 PM] Deciusmus: I suspect I'm going to get carried away and decide to write up both these holidays as each of my players would have experienced them, mostly for fun.
    In Tyrwingha, in a fey tinged village dedicated to the Wyrdling
    In Tyrwingha, in a small market town decided to `<undecided divine>`
    In Embry
    In the highland kingdoms, as a dwarf traveler would experience them
    
    I doubt it will be tonight but I have some ideas. Send me whatever you make up so I can fit it in
[2023-08-08 06:08 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah I’ll send a doc tonight with some unites thoughts
[2023-08-08 06:08 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`initial
[2023-08-08 06:09 PM] Deciusmus: Plus of course I need to decide how it would be celebrated in Cleenseau, which is dedicated to the warlord but unusually has a strong secondary wanderer vibe due to some ancient traveler/inn shrines that are still used
[2023-08-08 06:10 PM] Deciusmus: The Insingue community should have its own ritual on travelers night in remebrance of the travelers who are lost (maybe?) but feels like an opportunity for something unique
[2023-08-08 09:15 PM] rsulfuratus: would it mess up the timing of your game to have the traveler thing as the first full moon in the new year, instead of the first full moon before the solistice?
[2023-08-08 09:16 PM] Deciusmus: No, doesn’t matter much
[2023-08-08 09:16 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that could make an interesting historical point, where in drankor mirthblaze/twilight revelry/whatever was the ending point of the year and then early january is the new beginning
[2023-08-08 09:16 PM] rsulfuratus: and in the south  january would be a good time for new journeys, etc
[2023-08-08 09:17 PM] rsulfuratus: but not sure
[2023-08-08 09:17 PM] Deciusmus: That changes the holiday to more of a leave-taking rather than home coming
[2023-08-08 09:18 PM] rsulfuratus: i am wondering if it is interesting to develop it as a holiday with ancient leave-taking roots but which has acquired new meaning in the Greater Sembaran tradition
[2023-08-08 09:18 PM] rsulfuratus: perhaps leaving open the idea that it has a very different flavor in Chardon
[2023-08-08 09:18 PM] Deciusmus: I was wondering about 2 festivals or holy days of the traveler, on in early Dec and one in early Feb. the first was the historical “home coming” the second the historical “leave taking”
[2023-08-08 09:19 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that could work
[2023-08-08 09:19 PM] Deciusmus: With Drankorian roots having a bit of a “you are supposed to be home between Dec and Feb” vibe
[2023-08-08 09:19 PM] rsulfuratus: I like that
[2023-08-08 09:20 PM] rsulfuratus: then perhaps the early Dec homecoming could be the one that has diverged a bit among traditions and perhaps merged a bit with northern/kestavo solistice celebrations
[2023-08-08 09:20 PM] rsulfuratus: and the feb one is more universal
[2023-08-08 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: But actually I kinda like the idea of the ancient Drankorian festival of departure and leave-taking in early Jan changing significantly in the north to a different vibe, as leaving home in Jan doesn’t make sense
[2023-08-08 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: Ie either idea could work pretty well
[2023-08-08 09:22 PM] rsulfuratus: so from a meta perspective I think the extent to which you want to play around with kestavo solistic traditions might be the determining factor
[2023-08-08 09:23 PM] rsulfuratus: in a Dec homecoming + Feb leavetaking,  the Dec homecoming is the opportunity to borrow from Kestavo stuff, but there probably isn't space for a separate Kestavo solstice holiday
[2023-08-08 09:24 PM] Deciusmus: I’m more interested in playing around with fey-adjacent traditions in Tyrwingha
[2023-08-08 09:25 PM] Deciusmus: But I don’t think it has to be solstice per se, and in fact in Tyrwingha there might be a whole different situation related to Ethlenn
[2023-08-08 09:26 PM] Deciusmus: I am also not sure the Mos Numena holidays matter there as much
[2023-08-08 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: And I’m not sure solstice matters there.
[2023-08-08 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: In the Cleenseau game I don’t think it would immediately come up
[2023-08-08 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: putting the homecoming celebration at the first full moon before the solistic would put it on Nov 28 in 1748, which is convenient for the meta-reason of not having a major holiday happening while you were in Tollen and not mentioned (although this isn't a major issue IMO)
[2023-08-08 09:31 PM] Deciusmus: I gotta check 1719, I am not at my computer but I think the full moon was like Dec 19. I don’t want my players to have missed it, current date is Dec 4
[2023-08-08 09:33 PM] rsulfuratus: I think Dec 20 in 1719
[2023-08-08 09:34 PM] rsulfuratus: It also doesn’t have to be lunar - drankor / mos Numena is not necessary a particularly lunar religion
[2023-08-08 09:35 PM] Deciusmus: But I think this all works nicely. In Drankor, there were three big holidays, in the winter.  The “traveler homecoming” in late Nov/early Dec, then the wyrdling reveal in new years, then the “traveler leavetaking” in Feb.
[2023-08-08 09:38 PM] Deciusmus: The last might have been more minor,  but in Drankor the time between the two traveler holidays was seen as mystically important to not travel
[2023-08-08 09:39 PM] Deciusmus: Or whatever that connotation might have been lost.
[2023-08-08 09:40 PM] Deciusmus: In the kestavo tradition there probably is/was a solstice festival but it isn’t much alive in sembara,  but some northern kingdoms might still honor the solstice. But most people would not really celebrate it except as some traditions merging with the dec holiday
[2023-08-08 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: I kind of imagine Drankor as having this very ritual calendar, with lots of days with magical purposes in a way, the reasons having been lost to time
[2023-08-08 09:41 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway this is getting a bit beyond what I need for session prep and I still have to clean up the kitchen. I added a bunch of notes on Mirthblaze / whatever (still not sure about the name) to the google doc
[2023-08-08 09:43 PM] rsulfuratus: I do think it might make sense to set the homecoming festival to a fixed date, instead of based on the moon, though. maybe this was in Drankorian days celebrated also as the miracle of salvation, the day of thanks for when the gods rescued the Drankorians from the fall of Hkar?
[2023-08-08 09:44 PM] rsulfuratus: that could be pretty interesting - it could give it a fixed date sometime in Dec (after Dec 4th, but not when you all were in Tollen), it could give it an interestingly different gloss in Sembara and Chardon, where in Sembara it kind of merges with local solstice traditions and the imperial connotations fade
[2023-08-08 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: but perhaps this is not the right holiday for that
[2023-08-08 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway feel free to play around however suits you with these ideas
[2023-08-08 09:48 PM] rsulfuratus: Mos Numena could use a whole ritual calendar at some point. it is a little more complicated than the ritual calendar for the Dunmari Paantheon since Mos Numena is so diverse, but might be worth thinking about. there should probably be 6-10 relatively universal holidays with a bunch of smaller regional/local feast days overlaid
[2023-08-08 09:48 PM] Deciusmus: Agreed
[2023-08-08 09:50 PM] rsulfuratus: I had a lot of fun making the Dunmari ritual calendar. i think it is also really helpful for developing myths since often there will be myths associated with festivals, although perhaps less so for mos numena which is fairly diverse and diffuse, compared to dunmar where it is the state and cultural religion
[2023-08-08 09:51 PM] Deciusmus: I think the Mos Numena myths are really diverse. I like that the gods don’t really have personalities per se
[2023-08-08 09:51 PM] Deciusmus: So there is no story of when the Traveler did something
[2023-08-08 09:52 PM] rsulfuratus: right like drankorian miracles don't really resonate in sembara
[2023-08-08 09:52 PM] rsulfuratus: even the day of salvation or whatever that acknowledges the miracle of being rescued from hkar might have kind of lost its meaning over the years, especially as in drankor it would have never been associated with a specific god, and more celebrated as a national holiday
[2023-08-08 09:53 PM] Deciusmus: It’s all about blessings to the humans in their culture. To the Drankorians a lot of the divine is tied into magic, right?
[2023-08-08 09:53 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, and organized magic. this is my idea behind the ritual calendar and things like the intercalary days at the end of the year
[2023-08-08 09:54 PM] rsulfuratus: this would have been associated with specific (now lost) magical practices
[2023-08-08 09:54 PM] rsulfuratus: like maybe you can create a portal to another plane if you cast a specific spell each day during the 10 days of what is now mirthblaze
[2023-08-08 09:56 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2023-08-08 09:58 PM] rsulfuratus: Have you invented anything about Insingue, really? I am trying to get a bit of a sense of the culture, like what would their unique take on Mirthblaze be? Culturally they are fairly Sembaran, I guess
[2023-08-08 09:58 PM] Deciusmus: No, not really
[2023-08-08 09:59 PM] Deciusmus: All I have on them is in the March of Andonne doc in drive
[2023-08-08 10:01 PM] Deciusmus: But none of it was really about insingue
[2023-08-08 10:02 PM] Deciusmus: More about the refugee culture in Aurbez which I think might be fairly different from what Insingue was actually like
[2023-08-08 10:03 PM] rsulfuratus: our assumption is Insingue was a pretty fertile and wealthy agricultural region, right? before the plague it would have been like southern france or tuscany or something, I guess, although perhaps a bit more rain
[2023-08-08 10:04 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, wealthy and fertile for sure. Big trade with Cymea and Sembara and perhaps even out to Chardon.
[2023-08-08 10:05 PM] Deciusmus: In high school it was around where Beryl was from
[2023-08-08 10:05 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2023-08-08 10:06 PM] Deciusmus: It has always been a bit of a cipher though
[2023-08-08 10:06 PM] Deciusmus: Like, why is there a big city there? Was it more cymean or sembaran?
[2023-08-08 10:07 PM] Deciusmus: I think in the Drankorian expansion notes there were not many humans in the region when drankor expanded into it
[2023-08-08 10:07 PM] Deciusmus: I always imagine it as river town
[2023-08-08 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, definitely a river town
[2023-08-08 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus: I always thought of it as kind of Drankorian but always like the second city of the empire, that survived the plague and rebuilt but took on a kind of independent spirit
[2023-08-08 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus: the scholars fled west, the merchants fled to cymea, and the pioneers fled to insingue
[2023-08-08 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe it was protected from the first plague that destroyed drankor by some powerful magic so it has this kind of refuge in a land of devastation feeling right after the fall of the drankorian empire
[2023-08-08 10:11 PM] rsulfuratus: but had always been kind of a hotbed of anti-imperial sentiment (maybe some simmering remnants of the pre-Apolloyon civil war there)
[2023-08-08 10:11 PM] Deciusmus: Independence is a good key idea, it certainly fits in with the refugee culture in Maseau and south I’ve very lightly developed
[2023-08-08 10:13 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe a free trade place as well
[2023-08-08 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus: insingue to drankor is almost exactly the distance from rome to cairo. could have a kind of eyppt during roman times vibe
[2023-08-08 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus: close enough you can get grain shipments down the river and trade, but far enough away it isn't directly under the imperial thumb
[2023-08-08 10:15 PM] Deciusmus: It also could have been completely different during the Drankorian times. Maybe before the plague it was a sleepy river port funneling grain south to drankor from (one of?) the breadbasket of the empire
[2023-08-08 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus: right, doesn't necessarily matter that far back
[2023-08-08 10:17 PM] Deciusmus: Then some historically contingent set of leaders escapes the plague to Insingue and it gets this reputation as something else — an anti-imperial / we are very much not drankor rebirth
[2023-08-08 10:17 PM] Deciusmus: But in reality this is a contrast with Cymea not Drankor
[2023-08-08 10:17 PM] rsulfuratus: right, the important thing is that in the east Cymea initially has the kind of Drankor-continued vibe and Isingue is explicitly not that
[2023-08-08 10:18 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2023-08-08 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus: but i think its wealth would be from agriculture more than trade - it is on an important river and at a crossroads of cymea/sembara trade to dunmar and on to chardon, but as it is completely landlocked it is hard for it to be a really major trading power
[2023-08-08 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus: my mental model is kind of southern france
[2023-08-08 10:20 PM] Deciusmus: You could imagine three major post Drankorian urban cultures—
    Chardon is the “we will become greater than even our Drankorian roots” culture, Cymea the “relish the past, we will never improve on it” culture, and Insingue is the “we are nothing at all like Drankor, we reject its principles” culture
[2023-08-08 10:21 PM] Deciusmus: By why a big city in southern france? Or maybe insignue is not very urban and it is the dense agricultural land not the city itself that matters (as the city is small)
[2023-08-08 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus: I don't think of insingue as particularly a big city
[2023-08-08 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the river valley would be densely settled with many small towns, so fairly high population density, but not sure that insingue would really be a huge city by itself
[2023-08-08 10:24 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah actually that makes sense
[2023-08-08 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe historically the region was called something different, but Insingue is a symbol and now has kind of a "well are all insinguese" vibe
[2023-08-08 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus: I think I had the name Isatabor Alliance somewhere
[2023-08-08 10:25 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking similar but also that maybe Insingue was major (intellectual/religious/magical?) focus so everyone in the region saw it as something important
[2023-08-08 10:26 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I think that was the name of the region
[2023-08-08 10:26 PM] Deciusmus: / political entity
[2023-08-08 10:27 PM] rsulfuratus: right, Insingue was a center, no doubt, and kind of a cultural capital, but not necessarily hugely populated
[2023-08-08 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: Right I think that works well
[2023-08-08 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus: How about Revelfire for a name for the twilight revelry / wyrdling one?
[2023-08-08 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: I like that well enough. Although I wouldn’t discount fake Latin either
[2023-08-08 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus: hmm yeah maybe fake latin woud be better
[2023-08-08 10:44 PM] Deciusmus: On Insignue, here’s one idea…
    Something about the waters of the river near / in Insignue has healing and fertility properties. This works on soil too so the land is unusually rich. This attracts folks, but a rejection of the Drankorian ritual study leads the people who come here to be much more mystical/divine magic so a university doesn’t develop but the town becomes a cult center for Mos Numena and a place of divine connection. This is never large, but there is plenty of wealth in the soil, and the small towns are all attached very strongly to the place they get the magic plant growing (and human fertility causing) water
[2023-08-08 10:45 PM] Deciusmus: This generates a lot of wealth and a cultural focus (and an interesting magical twist, did Cha’mutte corrupt the healing power? Or suppress it?)
[2023-08-08 10:46 PM] rsulfuratus: hmm yeah that is quite interesting
[2023-08-08 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus: and could explain why the acidic ooze there now has grown so big
[2023-08-08 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: But the rejection of drankor leads to a lot of New England style town meetings and local rule, united  by this shared heritage / culture / economic / magical connection back to the source of the water
[2023-08-08 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus: probably makes sense to have a bit of a druidic focus, which would also be consistent with beryl's backstory
[2023-08-08 10:48 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that works
[2023-08-08 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus: perhaps the rangers could also have an insinguese root, maybe originally as the guardians of these magical waters
[2023-08-08 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus: they existed in the high school campaign so need to have a pre-Great-War origin story
[2023-08-08 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus: and also a reason to be heavily focused specifically on the southern border of Sembara
[2023-08-08 10:50 PM] Deciusmus: I like that
[2023-08-08 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus: could also contribute to the cultural relevancy of insigue - this would be the rangers headquarters or mystical center or something
[2023-08-08 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus: might push the rangers towards the "reclaim isingue" side in your campaign, not sure if that works or not
[2023-08-08 10:52 PM] Deciusmus: I dunno-  they could easily see themselves as the guardians of the humans who escaped more than reclaimed land
[2023-08-08 10:52 PM] Deciusmus: Perhaps there are factions between those who believe the waters can be restored and those who don’t
[2023-08-08 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus: hmm yeah that could be interesting
[2023-08-08 10:53 PM] Deciusmus: The rangers might be originally and at heart the guardians of the magic of the land, not the cultural trappings of the city
[2023-08-08 10:54 PM] Deciusmus: So reclaiming the town -
    Who cares
[2023-08-08 10:54 PM] Deciusmus: Reclaiming the magic -
    Key
[2023-08-08 10:54 PM] Deciusmus: And if it seemed important for them to be on a side, Beryl could have told them whether reclaiming the water is possible
[2023-08-08 10:55 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe beryl thought it was possible and told Rai and the Bhishma monks to try it......................
[2023-08-08 10:55 PM] Deciusmus: That would be awesome
[2023-08-08 10:55 PM] Deciusmus: But I’ll let you decide if it really happened 😀
[2023-08-08 10:55 PM] Deciusmus: When was Rai and the monks?
[2023-08-08 10:56 PM] Deciusmus: It was like 1720s, right?
[2023-08-08 10:56 PM] rsulfuratus: 1718
[2023-08-08 10:57 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe Rai succeeded and the magical water is now super back and giving major fertility power to the giant acid monster
[2023-08-08 10:57 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe
[2023-08-08 10:59 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not sure how big a role the rangers play in your campaign but feel free to have some reverberations echoing back to the rangers via beryl if it make sense
[2023-08-08 10:59 PM] Deciusmus: It’s my bedtime but I might try to add a few thoughts on holidays to your doc tomorrow. I like this stuff about Insignue, I’d imagine that the key vibe is these small, self-governing argicultural towns that associate closely with this magic water
[2023-08-08 11:00 PM] rsulfuratus: raises the big question of why did beryl and rai think they could succeed, and why were they wrong? but that is for the level 20 one-shot later on
[2023-08-08 11:00 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I have to go to bed too
