# Discord DM – 2024-03-21

[2024-03-21 12:56 PM] Deciusmus: I sent you a long email one of my players wrote about her character’s backstory. One thing it makes me wonder is — what do the gods and the fey think of
    each other?
[2024-03-21 12:56 PM] Deciusmus: Curious if you have any thoughts
[2024-03-21 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: (The character is a multiclass cleric of the wyrdling / fey trickster rogue which is a homebrew variant of arcane trickster with the source of magic being fey)
[2024-03-21 12:59 PM] Deciusmus: Secondarily it makes me wonder what it’s actually like to cast a spell in taelgar. How do they fey grant magic?
[2024-03-21 01:00 PM] Deciusmus: And how does being a wizard or sorcerer feel different from being a cleric?
[2024-03-21 01:05 PM] rsulfuratus: I saw the email just reading it now while I eat lunch
[2024-03-21 01:07 PM] rsulfuratus: the only fundamental thing about magic is that all magic in taelgar represents the manipulation of extranplanar forces in some way. there is a "magic in taelgar" note in worldbuilding/brainstorming
[2024-03-21 01:08 PM] rsulfuratus: I have always thought of divine magic (whether technically a cleric or someone like Delwath who is not mechanically a cleric but gets magic from divine beings) as effectively just praying in a some kind of particular way
[2024-03-21 01:08 PM] rsulfuratus: (although Delwath is a bit weird here since early on he did not know the source of his power was a god)
[2024-03-21 01:09 PM] rsulfuratus: you - as the spellcaster - aren't really doing anything, particularly, except opening a path for divine magic to reach the material plane
[2024-03-21 01:10 PM] rsulfuratus: (this bit is pretty undeveloped but the basic idea is the land of the dead acts as kind of a barrier and gods cannot easily reach past it, but living souls allow them to "tunnel" in a way)
[2024-03-21 01:11 PM] rsulfuratus: a wizard (or an "arcane-feeling" bard, like Seeker) would be basically manipulating residue leakage/energy from the plane of magic, represented by ley lines
[2024-03-21 01:12 PM] rsulfuratus: sorcerers and warlocks depend on the source of their magic. e.g., Cintra (divine soul sorcerer) was not manipulating residual energy of the plane of magic, she is a personal direct channel that allows Shakun to act through her
[2024-03-21 01:13 PM] rsulfuratus: the echo realms in various forms (feywild, shadowfell, dreamworld, etc) were "spun out" from Taelgar almost by accident when the material plane was created by the High Gods during the Riving, and that act left resonaces / echos that can also be manipulated
[2024-03-21 01:13 PM] rsulfuratus: this is where fey magic, probably also primal magic, some forms of necromancy, etc comes from
[2024-03-21 01:14 PM] rsulfuratus: this is probably somewhat in-between the cleric "I am a channel for a god to act" and the wizard "I can see and feel strands of arcane magic running across the world that I pull and twist to create spells"
[2024-03-21 01:18 PM] rsulfuratus: as far as what the gods and the fey think of each other - I guess it would depend a lot on the individual fey, and perhaps the individual god. I don't think there needs to be a settled standard approach here. 
    
    fey are ultimately the grandchildren of the High Gods, via the archfey. some archfey probably see themselves basically as gods themselves and might consider especially e.g. the embodied gods of the elves as peers. they might consider some of the weaker human gods (tanshi, kestavo) as effectively lesser than them
[2024-03-21 01:19 PM] rsulfuratus: one key point is the echo realms are actually harder to reach for the gods than the material plane (they are even further from the divine realms), so gods would be particularly weak in the echo realms
[2024-03-21 01:19 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-03-21 01:20 PM] Deciusmus: That all makes sense, although when bounced against D&D rules there is a little question of why clerics have to prepare spells
[2024-03-21 01:20 PM] Deciusmus: I think from Celyn's perspective, the basic idea Kiya hinted at - where the fey magic feels like work and the divine magic feels like a gift - fits pretty well
[2024-03-21 01:21 PM] Deciusmus: 3 of the 4 characters in my game have the fey touched feat, so there is a a second question I'm trying to answer about how is that different from other magic (although only Kiya of my 4 players seems interested in delving into what it feels like to cast spells in Taelgar)
[2024-03-21 01:21 PM] rsulfuratus: yes - I like the "misty step is something you have to work at to learn to do" angle
[2024-03-21 01:23 PM] rsulfuratus: I mean from a overarching point of view I think the key thing to decide is "what extraplanar energy are you manipulating" and "how are you doing it". with possible answers for the first one ranging from "plane of magic" to "feywild" to "plane of souls (this is probably psionics)" to "divine realms" and many things in between
[2024-03-21 01:23 PM] rsulfuratus: how you are doing it could be anything from "arcane rituals" to "prayers"
[2024-03-21 01:24 PM] rsulfuratus: basically to cast a spell you need a) a power source and b) a way to manipulate / manifest that power source in the material plane
[2024-03-21 01:25 PM] Deciusmus: Right, that makes sense.
[2024-03-21 01:29 PM] rsulfuratus: but, to take the cleric example, you could imagine all of the following "divine magic users":
    - a person born with an innate connection to a particular god, whose soul/spirit/consciousness functions as a conduit allowing the divine energy of the deity to effortlessly flow to the material plane, requiring only that the person learn how to shape the power flowing through them (a divine soul sorcerer)
    - a Lakan mystai who has studied the secret prayers and rituals of Laka and learned how to manipulate the resonances of the prayers that flow across the material plane (a wizard)
    - a character like Riswynn who is a very traditional "pray to the gods" cleric
    - a character like Delwath who I'm not actually sure exactly how he casts spells but it usually feels more like asking for a favor from a particular spirit than praying I think
    
    all those people could be manipulating divine magic in various ways, with very different mechanics
[2024-03-21 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway I have a meeting now but maybe I'll update the magic in taelgar notes later today
[2024-03-21 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: BTW, I was thinking about Delwath, I think he has a specific relationship with the tanshi and has almost worked together with each one to craft special abilities. 
    
    So asking for a favor works pretty well as a vibe, but I think he has additionally basically collaborated with each tanshi so that there are these specific favors from each one that work well
[2024-03-21 05:53 PM] rsulfuratus: doing a little note cleanup. why did you have the eight divines tagged status/tim? maybe just the symbols for the father and the night queen?
[2024-03-21 05:55 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I think so
[2024-03-21 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm taking the status/tim tags off them
