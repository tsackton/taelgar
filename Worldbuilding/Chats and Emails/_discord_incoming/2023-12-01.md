# Discord DM – 2023-12-01

[2023-12-01 09:47 AM] rsulfuratus: so, i was messing around a bit with homebrew stuff for playtest updates this morning - warlocks are quite tricky because most of the changes are built into invocations which so far I haven't figured out a way to modify via homebrew.
[2023-12-01 09:49 AM] rsulfuratus: also, for delwath, i have bit of a conundrum since one d&d shifts all subclasses to level 3, so if you straight convert you would lose a bunch of sorcerer spells and favor of the gods, in exchange for gaining better warlock invocations + more warlock spells
[2023-12-01 09:50 AM] rsulfuratus: on the other hand, sorcerers gain metamagic at level 2 and gain sorcery incarnate at level 1, which gives bonus to sorcerer spells (+1 DC and advantage on attack rolls)
[2023-12-01 09:54 AM] rsulfuratus: I think what I would do is:
    1) leave sorcerer alone (effectively swapping the level you get metamagic and favor of the gods, and sacrificing sorcery incarnate -- which isn't that impactful for Delwath anyway)
    2) balance bonus spells so you get 10 total from warlock + sorcerer
[2023-12-01 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus: i'm going to send an email with thoughts
[2023-12-01 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: Actually I think reskinning to UA stuff would work fine.  Basically the bonus sorceror spells were always flavored as "tanshi", so moving to warlock makes perfect sense
[2023-12-01 10:44 AM] Deciusmus: Delwath would go from having 5 sorcerer spells (3 from level, 2 bonus) and 11 warlock spells to 4 sorcerer spells and 21 warlock spells
[2023-12-01 10:44 AM] Deciusmus: which is obviously way better but fits with the UA model
[2023-12-01 10:45 AM] Deciusmus: Also, assuming I just kept Hex Warrior unchanged (but technically having gotten it at 3rd level rather than 1st) and kept invocations unchanged, he'd go from 5 invocations to 7, but one of the new ones would be Pact Weapon
[2023-12-01 10:45 AM] Deciusmus: So the next would be 1 new invocation
[2023-12-01 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: yes, that is easy, you just take the eldritch adept feat
[2023-12-01 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: the annoying thing is actually changing the invocations themselves
[2023-12-01 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: But no need
[2023-12-01 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: The only meanful change is thirsting blade given 3 attacks, I would just remember that
[2023-12-01 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: sure, i guess you are better at remembering things than most of the rest of the party
[2023-12-01 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: the rest of them don't change
[2023-12-01 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: I'm not going to forget that I get 3 instead of 2 attack
[2023-12-01 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: you can change damage type of pact of the blade, and you can use the mastery property of your pact weapon
[2023-12-01 10:47 AM] Deciusmus: I was potentially going to just ignore those
[2023-12-01 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus: but honestly warlock gets enough other goodies if you forget about those it doesn't matter
[2023-12-01 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus: probably easier to just ignore them
[2023-12-01 10:47 AM] Deciusmus: Changing the damage type doesn't seem quite right, flavor-wise
[2023-12-01 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus: well you could change it to be all radiant which could make sense
[2023-12-01 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: The mastery property does, but I'd rather just play with the 5E pact weapon rules where I store the sword in an extra-dimensional space but not get mastery, at least for now
[2023-12-01 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: sur
[2023-12-01 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: `*`sure
[2023-12-01 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: (The UA rules read to me like the intention is that if you bond with a magic weapon, it is just a regular magic weapon, i.e. you have to carry it around like normal)
[2023-12-01 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: yes, that is how i read it too
[2023-12-01 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus: so:
    1) you'll just remember the invocation changes (3 attacks, ignore the rest)
    2) you'll take the edritch adept feat to represent your extra invocation
    3) I'll update yezali subclass to add bonus spells (2 per level, with the first level ones copied from sorcerer)
    4) I'll update sorcerer to give you one bonus 1st level spell at level 3, to represent the bonus spell you'd normally get for divine soul
    5) we'll ignore other sorcerer changes in one D&D, figuring they come out in the wash
[2023-12-01 10:51 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah, makes sense
[2023-12-01 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus: i'm going to poke around at spells a bit
[2023-12-01 10:53 AM] Deciusmus: Add contact other plane to the yezali subclass as well, that is a useful feature that seems very flavor - appropriate
[2023-12-01 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-12-01 10:54 AM] Deciusmus: magical cunning I will either remember or forget about, don't worry about trying to add to D&D beyond
[2023-12-01 10:54 AM] Deciusmus: It is easy to track as an item, if I just want to remember if I used it or not
[2023-12-01 10:54 AM] Deciusmus: Actually that's what I'd do
[2023-12-01 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus: that one is actually quite easy to add
[2023-12-01 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus: anyway I'll mess around
[2023-12-01 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus: for spells, these are the hexblade spells:
    1st    shield, wrathful smite
    2nd    blur, branding smite
    3rd    blink, elemental weapon
    4th    phantasmal killer, staggering smite
    5th    banishing smite, cone of cold
[2023-12-01 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: the smite spells are flavorful
[2023-12-01 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: elemental weapon, phantsamal killer, and cone of cold are not particularly "Yezali" to me
[2023-12-01 10:56 AM] Deciusmus: What we were originally planning on doing was flavoring each level of sorcerer with spells from a different tanshi
[2023-12-01 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: ah right
[2023-12-01 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: the 1st level spells were "blessing of betali: sleep & sanctuary"
[2023-12-01 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: definitely need to keep sleep given the critical in game use during the kadmos battle
[2023-12-01 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus: yes I was going to swap the 1st level for sleep and sanctuary already
[2023-12-01 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus: to keep those
[2023-12-01 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus: you also have used sanctuary a decent among
[2023-12-01 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus: `*`amount
[2023-12-01 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: also true
[2023-12-01 10:58 AM] Deciusmus: But I could take sanctuary as a sorcerer spell
[2023-12-01 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: One way of flavoring it might be that each level gets one spell from Yezali and one from someone else.
    
    1st: shield - yezali, sleep - betali
    2nd: either of the hexblade ones - yezali, ?? - someone else
    3rd: blink - yezali, ?? - someone else
    4th: staggering smite - yezali, ?? someone else
    5th: banishing smite - yezali, ?? someone else
[2023-12-01 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: then I swap shield (which I took as a sorcerer spell) for sanctuary instead and end up with the same 1st level spells
[2023-12-01 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus: right that could work, let me fiddle around a bit
[2023-12-01 11:02 AM] Deciusmus: actually all of the smite spells feel pretty good
[2023-12-01 11:03 AM] Deciusmus: although they don't play well with other concentration spells
[2023-12-01 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: that is a one D&D change to import - all the smite spells are "when you hit with an attack, cast this as a bonus action" no concentration
[2023-12-01 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus: except the ones that have ongoing effects
[2023-12-01 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus: in the delwath solo, belati was not one of the lost tanshi, so i might update the spell sources to be consistent with the lost tanshi:
![[../_discord_assets/image-F9F18.png]]
[2023-12-01 11:14 AM] Deciusmus: yeah that makes sense
[2023-12-01 11:14 AM] Deciusmus: I don't remember where betali came from
[2023-12-01 11:14 AM] Deciusmus: but I like being consistent
[2023-12-01 11:14 AM] Deciusmus: and actually it works perfectly to have 1 spell from each, plus 5 from yezali
[2023-12-01 11:20 AM] Deciusmus: Also, Hunter's Mark might be a reasonable non-smite choice as a more flavor-appriopriate form of Hex
[2023-12-01 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus: level 1: shield (Yezali), sleep (Midri)
    level 2: moonbeam (Yezali), blur (K'onisati)
    level 3: blinding smite (with Playtest 6 modifications; Yezali), tongues (Taraka)
    level 4: shadow of moil (Yezali), arcane eye (Nisir)
    level 5: banishing smite (with Playtest 6 modification; Yezali), cone of cold (Yaliki'i)
    
    some thematically appropriate substitutions that I might consider:
    level 2: blur (Yezali), alter self (K'onisati)
    level 4: staggering smite (Yezali) or sickening radiance (Yezali) instead of shadow of moil
[2023-12-01 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus: also: if you are going to take the one D&D buffs, I think you need to take the spell revisions. the two that affect Delwath would be:
    (1) counterspell forces a con save and the target only loses the spell if they fail
    (2) banish gives a save at the end of each turn to return; banishing smite gives a save on hit (but does not give save at end of turn)
[2023-12-01 12:25 PM] Deciusmus: I have no issue with the counterspell rules as long as caster who tries to counter Delwath's spell has the same rules
[2023-12-01 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-12-01 12:26 PM] Deciusmus: banish makes sense as well, although I might reconsider whether it is worthwhile with a save at end of each turn
[2023-12-01 12:26 PM] Deciusmus: I liked Shining Smite quite a bit
[2023-12-01 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, that's fine. i was trying to avoid too many concentration smites (blinding does not require concentration)
[2023-12-01 12:27 PM] Deciusmus: I think Shining Smite - skinned as the moonlight vibe from moonbeam - is more fun
[2023-12-01 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus: will swap that for moonbeam for sure
[2023-12-01 12:28 PM] Deciusmus: It is concentration, but against an invisible foe, super useful and worth the concentration. And moonbeam is a fun spell but not one delwath is super likely to ever cast
[2023-12-01 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus: do you want to still keep blinding smite then?
[2023-12-01 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus: which is less thematic but has the advantage of no concentration so you can stack it on a concentration buff
[2023-12-01 12:29 PM] Deciusmus: I think thematically having Yezali stuff be mostly smites makes sense
[2023-12-01 12:29 PM] Deciusmus: The above list honestly feels a little too good 🙂
[2023-12-01 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus: i think i would leave shadow of moil which was a good spell but rarely worth the concentration these days (but you used it a fair bit when you first got it)
[2023-12-01 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus: that gives two defense and three offense for yezali
[2023-12-01 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus: arcane eye and cone of cold might be a little strong for nisir and yaliki
[2023-12-01 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus: but they are very thematic
[2023-12-01 12:31 PM] Deciusmus: I agree about shadow of moil, although maybe reskinned to be resistant to something other than radiant damage?
[2023-12-01 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus: radiant is a super-uncommon damage type to face so it is hard to change it to something else without significantly buffing the spell
[2023-12-01 12:34 PM] Deciusmus: it just feels themeactically weird
[2023-12-01 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus: thunder or psychic are roughly equally rare, not sure either makes any more sense
[2023-12-01 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus: radiant is like "super strong light" so i'm not sure it is actually thematically wrong, it isn't necessarily "holy"
[2023-12-01 12:37 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, probably easier to just keep it
[2023-12-01 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: spider climb could be an alternative to blur; same with enthrall (skinned as a cloud of butterflies)
[2023-12-01 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus: i like enthrall
[2023-12-01 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: otherwise blur and shadow of moil kinda feel the same
[2023-12-01 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: I can't think of something better than cone of cold for Yaliki
[2023-12-01 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: this list seems pretty good, if a bit on the powerful side:
    
    level 1: shield (Yezali), sleep (Midri)
    level 2: shining smite (Yezali), enthrall (K'onisati)
    level 3: blinding smite (with Playtest 6 modifications; Yezali), tongues (Taraka)
    level 4: shadow of moil (Yezali), arcane eye (Nisir)
    level 5: banishing smite (with Playtest 6 modification; Yezali), cone of cold (Yaliki'i)
[2023-12-01 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the Yezali spells are thematic and balanced by being very concentration/bonus action heavy
[2023-12-01 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: sleep for Midri will definitely stay for consistency
[2023-12-01 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: and tongues for Taraka is perfect
[2023-12-01 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: here is an alternative idea for the others:
    level 2calm emotions (Yaliki'i, from the clear mind aspect); level 4 freedom of movement (K'onisati); level 5 scrying (Nisir)
[2023-12-01 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure if that is overall stronger or weaker
[2023-12-01 01:02 PM] Deciusmus: it gives me a extra "Whatever I want" spell
[2023-12-01 01:03 PM] Deciusmus: which is technically more powerful
[2023-12-01 01:03 PM] Deciusmus: Freedom of Movement is interesting idea though
[2023-12-01 01:05 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is definitely more powerful though
[2023-12-01 01:05 PM] Deciusmus: Calm Emotions is much better than Enthrall
[2023-12-01 01:06 PM] Deciusmus: Scrying is not necessarily better than arcane eye or cone of cold, but it is a spell delwath already has, so the net effect is I can pick up any spell in exchange
[2023-12-01 01:06 PM] Deciusmus: Arcane Eye is probably more useful than Freedom of Movement though
[2023-12-01 01:08 PM] Deciusmus: What about Entrall (k'onisati), ice storm (yaliki'i), scry (nisir)
[2023-12-01 01:12 PM] Deciusmus: Or:
    
    Frost Fingers (1st level, Yaliki), Grasping Vine (4th level, Midri), Scry (Nisir)
[2023-12-01 01:12 PM] Deciusmus: I really like Enthrall as a flock of butterflies for Konstani
[2023-12-01 01:12 PM] Deciusmus: And tongues for Taraka
[2023-12-01 01:13 PM] Deciusmus: But I have 4 1st level sorcerer spells from sorcorer: For game consistency they have to include Sanctuary, Sleep, and Shield
[2023-12-01 01:13 PM] Deciusmus: But I could drop absorb elements or create/destroy water
[2023-12-01 01:15 PM] Deciusmus: (I've never cast absorb elements and I don't think I've cast create/destory water)
[2023-12-01 01:17 PM] Deciusmus: The set (sleep, arcane eye, cone of cold) is the best set of actual useful spells, as cone of cold is a good AoE, which Delwath doesn't have (sickening radiance isn't always the best choice), and arcane eye is just very useful
[2023-12-01 01:27 PM] rsulfuratus: you only have 3 level one sorcerer spells (absorb elements, create/destroy water, shield) plus sleep and sanctuary as bonus spells
[2023-12-01 01:27 PM] rsulfuratus: i like sleep as midri, it is a good flavor for hibernation
[2023-12-01 01:27 PM] rsulfuratus: i also like enthrall as kostani
[2023-12-01 01:29 PM] rsulfuratus: mostly i think that as it is already a strong set of bonus spells having both a very useful out of combat scouting option AND a very useful AoE is too much
[2023-12-01 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I kinda agree. But not sure where the fix is. Moving nisir to scry doesn’t change anything I just take arcane eye with my newly freed slot
[2023-12-01 01:32 PM] Deciusmus: Ah, I was looking at UA sorcerers who have 4 known spells at second level
[2023-12-01 01:44 PM] rsulfuratus: i think sleep (midri), enthrall (kosanti), tongues (taraka), ice storm (yaliki), scry (nisir) is fine.
    
    ice storm is a worse aoe than cone of cold; you are already getting two spells to pick with tongues and banishing smite and the 3rd best new spell you could pick is probably not that strong anyway
[2023-12-01 02:32 PM] rsulfuratus: okay, I think delwath is all updated. you'll have to add the eldritch adept feat to get the extra invocation, and you have 1 sorcerer spell and 3 warlock spells free to choose
[2023-12-01 02:33 PM] rsulfuratus: I did not make new versions of counterspell and banish yet - will eventually do this for counterspell, but if you decide not to keep banish i'm not going to make a one d&d version
[2023-12-01 02:34 PM] rsulfuratus: i did make new versions of the smite spells
[2023-12-01 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: you need to remove sanctuary from Blessings of the Tanshi
[2023-12-01 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: I also seem to have contact other plane 2x
[2023-12-01 03:15 PM] Deciusmus: nevermind
[2023-12-01 03:15 PM] Deciusmus: that is correct
[2023-12-01 03:15 PM] Deciusmus: once is the free usage
[2023-12-01 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: Blinding Smite is also not correctly upgrading damage when cast with  5th lvl slot
[2023-12-01 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: Or did you mean for me to get Sanctuary from the Tanshi as the "one free spell" from divine soul?
[2023-12-01 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: Ah, you did
[2023-12-01 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: thats the 1 sorceror spell
[2023-12-01 03:22 PM] rsulfuratus: yes meant the sanctuary as one free spell; will check blinding smite and see what the issue is
[2023-12-01 03:40 PM] rsulfuratus: you might need to switch back to the old yezali and then to the new one again to get the blinding smite to update
[2023-12-01 04:45 PM] Deciusmus: blinding smite just doesn't seem to have scaling in the spell
[2023-12-01 04:45 PM] Deciusmus: switching doesn't help
[2023-12-01 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: I had the type of higher level scaling set wrong. just fixed it. hopefully will update
[2023-12-01 04:48 PM] Deciusmus: doesn't seem to have helped
[2023-12-01 04:56 PM] rsulfuratus: its fixed
[2023-12-01 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: yup
[2023-12-01 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: thanks
[2023-12-01 04:58 PM] Deciusmus: I think I am going to take
    
    Healing Word
    Dream
    Synaptic Static
    Mislead
[2023-12-01 05:01 PM] rsulfuratus: you don't want a damage boost like hex or spirit shroud? 3 attacks makes them very strong
[2023-12-01 05:01 PM] rsulfuratus: honestly although your sword is cool, with 3 attacks shadow blade is also rather strong
[2023-12-01 05:01 PM] rsulfuratus: (but probably not delwath's flavor)
[2023-12-01 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: I am thinking of taking life drinker
[2023-12-01 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: whatever is it
[2023-12-01 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: invocation that gives +1d6
[2023-12-01 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: Hex is good but it takes concentration
[2023-12-01 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: spirit shroud is very powerful though
[2023-12-01 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: +2d8 is pretty good
[2023-12-01 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: that would actually be an ungodly amount of damage"
    
    4d8 + 1d6 + 10 (x3) against anyone I've hunter's cursed
[2023-12-01 05:04 PM] rsulfuratus: well it is very bonus action heavy
[2023-12-01 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: it takes 2 bonus actions to set up
[2023-12-01 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: that is true
[2023-12-01 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: one for spirit shroud, one for hunters curse
[2023-12-01 05:04 PM] rsulfuratus: but also monks make 5 attacks and wellby can knock someone out with one hit if they fail a con save, so you do need to keep up
[2023-12-01 05:05 PM] Deciusmus: The smites are very powerful
[2023-12-01 05:05 PM] rsulfuratus: actually with the one d&d stuff seeker and riswynn kind of get left behind because they don't really optimize spells at all
[2023-12-01 05:05 PM] Deciusmus: blinding smite is 5d8 per cast, no concentration
[2023-12-01 05:05 PM] rsulfuratus: and no save for initial blindness
[2023-12-01 05:06 PM] Deciusmus: so with x3 attacks and hexblade curse thing you fish for criticals then drop 14d8 when you get one
[2023-12-01 05:06 PM] Deciusmus: the smites are amazing because you can cast it once you know you rolled a crit
[2023-12-01 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, 10d10 + 4d8 is even better, it just depends on whether concentration is running on something else
[2023-12-01 05:10 PM] rsulfuratus: crit smites are a lot of fun but I think mathematically suboptimal, because if you don't roll a crit early there is a good chance the extra crit damage won't matter (you would have killed it anyway with 7d8+10)
[2023-12-01 05:10 PM] Deciusmus: true
[2023-12-01 05:11 PM] Deciusmus: it is a bit hard to know on which attack to drop the smite
[2023-12-01 05:11 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. do you drop it on your first one that hits, or wait for crit
[2023-12-01 05:12 PM] Deciusmus: but once I get quicken spell at next level, there is so much to do with bonus action you just kinda wait and see
[2023-12-01 05:12 PM] rsulfuratus: mathematically, I think if you are going to use a smite it is better to use it on your first hit than wait
[2023-12-01 05:12 PM] Deciusmus: missed with your last attack? don't smite, cast something else
[2023-12-01 05:12 PM] rsulfuratus: (except banish which you want to hold on for the status effect at `<50 hp)
[2023-12-01 05:13 PM] rsulfuratus: but e.g. blinding the one round guaranteed blind is worth more than the extra crit damage, especially if you are going before kenzo and can set up 5 attacks with advantage
[2023-12-01 05:13 PM] Deciusmus: true
[2023-12-01 05:13 PM] rsulfuratus: but yes with quicken the bonus action becomes very valulable and so more complicated - e.g. quicken booming blade is very strong too
[2023-12-01 05:14 PM] rsulfuratus: or quicken green flame if you are fighting hordes. you could likely take out 6-7 minions in one turn with three attacks + quicken green flame
[2023-12-01 05:14 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2023-12-01 05:14 PM] Deciusmus: i have basically never used green flame
[2023-12-01 05:15 PM] Deciusmus: but actually I think the math for it is pretty good
[2023-12-01 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: it is good if you are fighting multiple enemies, and booming is good if you can get the movement effect to trigger, but neither is better than 2 attacks if you don't get the rider effects
[2023-12-01 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: Right, that's true
[2023-12-01 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: but e.g. against minions you really should be using green flame because you take out 2 and have a good chance to take out 3 if you hit, and minions usually don't have a high ac
[2023-12-01 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: against e.g. grash it is much more dubious
[2023-12-01 05:20 PM] Deciusmus: anyway, shadow blade is not the right vibe, but I might consider sprit shroud instead of mislead or dream
[2023-12-01 05:20 PM] rsulfuratus: honestly if you want hunter's mark instead of hex that would be fine too, they are basically the same spell
[2023-12-01 05:20 PM] rsulfuratus: but might not be worth the concentration / bonus action tax
[2023-12-01 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: the problem with hex/hunter's mark is the concentation
[2023-12-01 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: There is no point in having that and shadow shroud, for example, as you can only keep one of them up
[2023-12-01 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: right. 
    
    btw if you want the 1D&D version of lifedrinker as your extra invocation, it should be possible to homebrew that as a feat
[2023-12-01 05:24 PM] Deciusmus: Basically, I see it that there are 2 different paths I could take....
    lean on smites for bonus action/additional damage and use concentration for buff/debuff/control (sickening radiance/fly/shadow of moil/banish)
[2023-12-01 05:25 PM] Deciusmus: or just fully optimize for damage and assume concentration will mostly be going to a +dice per hit spell (spirit shroud is probably the best option there)
[2023-12-01 05:25 PM] Deciusmus: being able to fly in the grath fight thou was really useful
[2023-12-01 05:25 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean fly + blinding smite is very strong it is just spell-slot-heavy
[2023-12-01 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: yeah but it is super rare for us to have two combats where it is worth buring much in the way of spells without a short rest in between
[2023-12-01 05:26 PM] rsulfuratus: right, that's true
[2023-12-01 05:26 PM] rsulfuratus: so it probably doesn't matter
[2023-12-01 05:27 PM] rsulfuratus: the smite-heavy playstyle seems fun even it if is not quite as damage optimized
[2023-12-01 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: and the magic cunning + pact of the rod keeper gives me one complete spell slot reset per day anyway
[2023-12-01 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: (magic cunning gives back 2, pact the 3rd)
[2023-12-01 05:27 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2023-12-01 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: plus mental prison is also pretty strong
[2023-12-01 05:28 PM] Deciusmus: even though it fizzled against grash
[2023-12-01 05:28 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i forgot in the grash fight they still take damage even if the save succeeds, and creatures immune to charm just auto-succeed
[2023-12-01 05:29 PM] rsulfuratus: they aren't immune to the spell completely
[2023-12-01 05:29 PM] Deciusmus: right, I misread that as well
[2023-12-01 05:29 PM] rsulfuratus: kenzo rolling high on initiative is pretty important to your playstyle because you and seeker both have big spells that fizzle against charm immunity
[2023-12-01 05:30 PM] Deciusmus: If I had remembered about soul sight I could have just spent the first round tossing something else out, or even just attacking
[2023-12-01 05:30 PM] rsulfuratus: there is probably an argument for going damage in round 1 and then dropping the big spell in round 2 if kenzo is behind you
[2023-12-01 05:30 PM] rsulfuratus: there is probably an argument for going damage in round 1 and then dropping the big spell in round 2 if kenzo is behind you
[2023-12-01 05:30 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-12-01 05:31 PM] rsulfuratus: it is tough to remember not just your abilities but everyone else's too
[2023-12-01 05:31 PM] Deciusmus: The grash fight was pretty awesome, so it worked out
[2023-12-01 05:32 PM] Deciusmus: honestly the big spell fizzling kinda worked narratively even if it was annoying the moment
[2023-12-01 05:32 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-12-01 05:33 PM] Deciusmus: Anyway, I might change up something for Spirit Shroud, but Dream is pretty appealing, because even with teleport, being able to talk to someone in their sleep is pretty powerful
[2023-12-01 05:34 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah Dream is super-useful, i'd probably keep that
[2023-12-01 05:34 PM] rsulfuratus: you can always leave things as they are and swap something on level up if you want
[2023-12-01 05:34 PM] Deciusmus: Although what does "known to you" mean, something you will have to figure out. Is the guy I scryed once with the jade hand "known to me"
[2023-12-01 05:34 PM] Deciusmus: `*`jade fragment in Ursk
[2023-12-01 05:34 PM] rsulfuratus: no, it has to be someone you've met
[2023-12-01 05:34 PM] rsulfuratus: doesn't have to be someone you are friends with
[2023-12-01 05:35 PM] Deciusmus: I should send scary nightmares to fausto
[2023-12-01 05:36 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, you could kill someone by just nightmaring them every night, if they keep failing their saves and don't have a good alternative source of healing. Sure they can burn hit dice but they don't get them back...
[2023-12-01 05:36 PM] Deciusmus: That is a bit dark but sorta appealing to try to mess with fausto that way
[2023-12-01 05:37 PM] Deciusmus: I have to remember to collect body parts and hair clippings and thing from our enemies more
[2023-12-01 05:37 PM] Deciusmus: both for scry and dream
[2023-12-01 05:40 PM] Deciusmus: On a different topic...
[2023-12-01 05:40 PM] Deciusmus: I have mostly been working, but I did spent a bit of time yesterday and this afternoon on the Obsidian stuff
[2023-12-01 05:42 PM] Deciusmus: I have two things basically working:
    
    1. prepositions. add "q" to the format specifier and it adds prepositions
    2. prepare for export, which makes the headers all static
[2023-12-01 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-D9429.png]]
[2023-12-01 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: It is not super well tested, but I figure I should just push it anywy?
[2023-12-01 05:49 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-12-01 05:50 PM] Deciusmus: For export there is a new template, "prepare for export". 
    
    It shows a dialog for the "Export date" and then processes all files that have a header version attribute by regenerating the header in "static" mode as of the date you typed in
[2023-12-01 05:50 PM] Deciusmus: you just need to be careful to not commit the changes
[2023-12-01 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: changing the filter is pretty trivial
[2023-12-01 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: I was just messing around with how not to run header generation on pages that have not previously had a header generated, so where it might fail or have weird side effectives
[2023-12-01 05:52 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i mean you can always revert, but I think my workflow would be:
    1) run python to generate a new obsidian vault with `%%`^Campaign`%%` stuff stripped
    2) run template to make static
    3) run osidianhtml to make html
[2023-12-01 05:52 PM] Deciusmus: that probably works pretty well
[2023-12-01 05:52 PM] rsulfuratus: if you just leave the `--dview` option off the python code it will just pass code without doing conversion
[2023-12-01 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: BTW, the template no longer bothers with the intermediate stage of the "regen" that creates a "gen" templat
[2023-12-01 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: if you run the regenerate header template it just immediately inserts the new header
[2023-12-01 06:19 PM] Deciusmus: That is all pushed
[2023-12-01 06:19 PM] Deciusmus: let me know if you see bugs
[2023-12-01 06:20 PM] Deciusmus: Dana is working tomorrow and Zachary has rehersal so I might spent some time on taelgar stuff
[2023-12-01 06:20 PM] Deciusmus: btw, I think your human culture doc is good but I'm not sure if there is "too much" going on in some of these places
[2023-12-01 06:21 PM] Deciusmus: but more later, going to eat dinner
[2023-12-01 08:48 PM] rsulfuratus: one small thing - i'd probably make the default option be to show prepositions, and have the format spec remove prepositions. it is kind of annoying to have to add q anytime you overwrite a format spec in whereabouts
[2023-12-01 09:13 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that makes sense
[2023-12-01 09:17 PM] rsulfuratus: there are a few display issues but probably not going to mess around tonight. 
    
    currently unknown is weird, needs a fix
    events not having the "Happened in: " or similar makes single date events look quite awkward ("DR 1059 - 1059, 0 years)
    I don't necessarily think the default should be not to show page dated info for places/items (e.g. Destroyed in Year)
[2023-12-01 09:20 PM] rsulfuratus: ah guess default is display "destroyed in" just need to clean up endstatus stuff when it doesn't make sense "A consumed by Cha'mutte's plague city in ..."
[2023-12-01 09:20 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway, mostly not doing this tonight
[2023-12-01 09:20 PM] rsulfuratus: just a few notes
[2023-12-01 09:49 PM] Deciusmus: If you give me some pages that are messy I’ll look at some cleanup tomorrow afternoon
