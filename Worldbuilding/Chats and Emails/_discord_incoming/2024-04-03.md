[2024-04-03 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus: what do you think of an eight-pointed seedling as a holy symbol of the mother? something kind of like: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1225080386766508075/1225083334397267998/rsulfuratus_Design_a_straightforward_and_iconic_symbol_for_a_fa_c42bfe41-365d-4031-8c22-17c2dd330294.png?ex=661fd6c3&is=660d61c3&hm=4298323e1fd2ebcbb21b45f9a333a632ef5ade66bf9e4679adebc47b57693e8f&
[2024-04-03 10:04 AM] Deciusmus: I like that
[2024-04-03 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus: look in the #religions channel on Taelgarverse and let me know if you like any of the stained glass or paintings of The Mother
[2024-04-03 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: waiting for someone to show up to a meeting they booked on my calendar, and looking at random pages tagged needswork. Curious what you think about this - working on Sibyl's Hall, which is basically an undergrad college of the University of Chardon. It is functionally both a place and an organization. It seems a bit silly to have two pages, one for the academic organization and another for the physical infrastructure. but also not sure we want to start tagging things with multiple categories (e.g., both place and organization) as that would cause unpredictable errors in the javascript code imo
[2024-04-03 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: I think tagging both is probably wrong. Either:
    - just create a page for the organization and don’t have a page for the building (ie have the organization page just say “Based out of Sibyl’s Hall in the university… but don’t link it)
    - actually have both pages with slightly different content
[2024-04-03 03:32 PM] Deciusmus: I do a fair bit of #1, ie if I’m making up a small village I won’t necessarily make pages for all the people.
[2024-04-03 03:32 PM] Deciusmus: Sibyls hall could just be text on the main university of Chardon page
[2024-04-03 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: I like the vibe of this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1225080386766508075/1225123810592686100/rsulfuratus_A_medieval_stained_glass_window_design_in_a_fantasy_f4dcc5c3-26ae-498e-ab34-462c75aa9cb5.png?ex=661ffc76&is=660d8776&hm=636bc8e98081d883e1248d4140d177f5ee07cb4a903a6b5208b591f8e901f453& and the whole series of the greenish healing ones
[2024-04-03 04:46 PM] Deciusmus: I also like this one https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1225080386766508075/1225103665900027924/rsulfuratus_A_medieval_fantasy_painting_that_shows_the_Mother_a_1f06513b-eb51-4cca-ab6b-b37903a01559.png?ex=661fe9b3&is=660d74b3&hm=eb67c6742f5afa85decdc136defaebf4a3bf55bec824423f3c64b7025a34c458& but not as much as the healing sequence.
[2024-04-03 04:47 PM] Deciusmus: I like the pregnant ones not in profile i.e. like  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1225080386766508075/1225123387618230342/rsulfuratus_A_medieval_fantasy_painting_that_shows_the_Mother_a_fb5536e2-349b-42e9-bb27-3b8aaccb7a40.png?ex=661ffc11&is=660d8711&hm=8faefb2fbb51091e4de3336ca7ee4df11100ae6ead50f9f47a1bb5b877f7535c& look a little too airbrushed or something. They lose some of the "everywoman" vibe (maybe the woman is too pretty? I'm not sure). There is just something I don't like as much
[2024-04-03 04:48 PM] Deciusmus: I kinda like the square ones from here as well https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1225080386766508075/1225086425855426610/rsulfuratus_Create_a_series_of_four_illustrations_each_depictin_07ad30b4-b17b-493e-bfb5-241f996e51f5.png?ex=661fd9a4&is=660d64a4&hm=db2a1071d332fcf621a62d774df6394e289da935ea16f48d270f84ff7b4d3679&
[2024-04-03 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: I actually liked the one you picked for obsidian, I think losing the circlet makes the pregnant one "fit" a bit better
[2024-04-03 04:58 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, okay, going to keep that, was just messing around with a few other variants
