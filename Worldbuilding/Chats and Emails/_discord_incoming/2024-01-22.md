# Discord DM – 2024-01-22

[2024-01-22 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus: i am in the (slow) process of refactoring my taelgar python code, as i've found that a number of the export vault functions are also useful for things like the session note summarization code and other gpt things, so I'm refactoring to reorganize functions/classes in a more sensible way for reuse
    
    ultimately, i'm planning on moving everything to the taelgar-utils repo and deleting the site gen repo
    
    when I do, i'm going to restructure the accessory website files as discussed above, so that the website/overrides directory contains shared CSS and overrides, and the website/extras directory contains examples of non-shared stuff (e.g., my home.html and homepage.css, styling.css, my logo and banner image, various other things)
    
    export_vault.py will copy files in overrides to a specified dest in your website repo, overwriting files of the same name but not touching anything else in the dest; you'll need to manually manage anything not in the website/overrides directory
