# Discord DM – 2025-11-01

[2025-11-01 09:39 AM] rsulfuratus: I’ve gotten deeply sucked into filling out stubs and other low detail notes. Pushing a lot of stuff. As sometimes I’m hitting clee-relevant things I’m also tagging some status/check/mike fyi
[2025-11-01 12:43 PM] Deciusmus: did you push recently?
[2025-11-01 12:43 PM] Deciusmus: I didn't see much status/check/mike
[2025-11-01 12:43 PM] Deciusmus: I am mostly working on prep but was dipping into cleanup
[2025-11-01 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe 8-10 notes? have mostly been doing dunmar
[2025-11-01 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus: did a pass through the Enst-Wistel watershed
[2025-11-01 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: ah, I see
[2025-11-01 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus: and a few random things
[2025-11-01 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: ok, I was looking at people
[2025-11-01 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: but not much there I guess
[2025-11-01 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah got tired of people, mostly working on gazetteer
[2025-11-01 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: do oyou have any prompts or notes for filling staging pages?
[2025-11-01 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: There is a bit in the markdown templates note. But I’ve been kinda inconsistent. Main thing is to ask it to read the metadata spec to get yaml right, ask it to search, ask it to only include verified information, ask it to keep the main text in the style of in-world Wikipedia (don’t refer to player, PCs, etc use in world names) and keep meta stuff to comment at end in `%%` tags
[2025-11-01 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: How I phrase those points is pretty variable
