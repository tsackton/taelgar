# Discord DM – 2023-12-23

[2023-12-23 03:06 PM] Deciusmus: here's what I have for fey stuff right now, btw:
    
    My players are going to discover 4 documents:
    
    1) A letter for the Oracle of the Red in Tyrwingha to warlocks of the Mostreve Army warning that Lord Umbraeth sometimes sends his Hands of Gloom (perhaps need a better name) to the mortal realm to try to trick anyone aligned to Ethlynn into swearing an oath to leave the area -- but don't fall for it, they have no power as long as you don't enter Duskmire. 
    
    2) A report from the elf you made up to the Rangers about the Bogblight, which I need to make up, but is some kind of fey incursion from Duskmire that they helped deal with
    
    3) A book of stories written as an instruction manual for a bard or other storyteller, with marginal notes and such on when the audience should laugh/cry/etc. There are three relevant tales here---
    One about a Arryn I
[2023-12-23 03:07 PM] Deciusmus: One about Arryn i's second life in twlights grace, highlighting his place in Ethlyns court
[2023-12-23 03:07 PM] Deciusmus: One about an ancient love story between Ethlyn and Umbraeth
[2023-12-23 03:08 PM] Deciusmus: One about the Twilight Revel, a time of games of skill/festivities/dancing in Twilight's Grace, which talks about Umbraeth's role (somewhat masked) in organizing some of the games
[2023-12-23 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: 4) An excerpt from a Insinguese translation of an Cymean polemic about the decline of proper language and grammar from about 150 years after the fall of Drankor, castigating the grandees of Cymea for not keeping up "proper" Drankorian customs and speech. The interest is that is full of examples of brilliant and wonderful Drankorian writing, one of which is a page from `*`On the Feywild* (or perhaps a moreinteresting name) that is a drankorian book that outlines places in the feywild
[2023-12-23 03:12 PM] Deciusmus: The key info from #4 is a description of the borders and portals to the Duskmire, and in particular, I want the PCs to know that the portal near Cleenseau is new
[2023-12-23 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: However, I might need to change #4 a bit as I'm not sure when Amberglow fell -- although it might be ok if it predates Amberglow falling
[2023-12-23 03:21 PM] Deciusmus: Duskmire was originally a small kingdom wedged between Amberglow, Twilight's Grace, Dreamhaven, and some unnamed fey kingdom that covers the heartland of Sembara (for various in game reasons I don't want Duskmire to be congruent with the heartland of Sembara)
[2023-12-23 03:25 PM] Deciusmus: It grew significantly to the south when the Cloudspinner was imprisoned, and more when the disruptions of the Great War
[2023-12-23 03:30 PM] Deciusmus: So actually having the Drankorian text describe Duskmire as a small realm nestled to the north of Amberglow, with only a single known portal somewhere in the Sentinels near Ulrich Pass, works pretty well
