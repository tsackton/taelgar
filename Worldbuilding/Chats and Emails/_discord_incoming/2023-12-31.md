[2023-12-31 11:28 AM] Deciusmus: How hard is it to tweak the map? I don’t have a good way to do it but have a few modifications I’d like to make to Sembara, mostly adding some rivers and forests
[2023-12-31 02:13 PM] rsulfuratus: not hard. coastlines are a bit of a pain but adding rivers and forests is easy
[2023-12-31 02:16 PM] Deciusmus: If you get a chance, adding Cleenseau Wood, which basically streches from immediately north of cleenseau to ~30 miles south of Ainwick, and then a couple small hills just east of the wood in the northern part of the Barony of Aveil would be great
[2023-12-31 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: can you sketch it out and send me a draft? I can add it to the map then
