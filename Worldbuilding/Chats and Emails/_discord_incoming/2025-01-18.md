# Discord DM – 2025-01-18

[2025-01-18 09:45 AM] rsulfuratus: we are going up to NH today so i don't know how much taelgar stuff i'll do or whether i'll be online much. was just poking around a little while kate does a quick errand, and thinking that getting discord notes into obsidian obviates a lot of the need for things like status/cleanup/external and the dm_owner: shared and all that. 
    
    i think that everything from google drive is largely in obsidian anyway, and in any case that would be fairly easy to dump in there. 
    
    the biggest question is whether it is worth trying to mass-download emails and put them in obsidian as raw notes, that seems a little more tricky. 
    
    but if we had google drive, email, and discord as external sources in obsidian, we could drop all the tagging about shared external stuff, and just use dm_notes for private information from my old OneNote, emails with other people (mostly you to your players) and our separate dm folders in Obsidian
[2025-01-18 09:46 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah - I actually have been uploading emails as well. There are actually not that many of them.
[2025-01-18 09:46 AM] Deciusmus: But yes, I think dm_notes for private info is where we should end up
[2025-01-18 09:49 AM] Deciusmus: My goal was to have:
    status/cleanup/gameupdate and status/needswork/game update for cases where the only thing missing from the page is stuff that came up in game
    
    (In particular using that instead of dm_notes: color for the cases where the only thing missing is vibes or roleplaying notes that I invented on the spot while running the character)
[2025-01-18 09:49 AM] Deciusmus: Then all shared conversations in brainstorming
[2025-01-18 09:50 AM] Deciusmus: And then use dm_notes only pretty much for stuff where either
    (A) I’ve made something up but haven’t written it down
    (B) I have private dm notes
[2025-01-18 09:52 AM] rsulfuratus: that sounds great
[2025-01-18 09:53 AM] rsulfuratus: we are packing up now but i'll be on and off
[2025-01-18 09:54 AM] Deciusmus: Dana is working and Z has plans with friends so I am likely to spend most of the afternoon on this
[2025-01-18 01:34 PM] rsulfuratus: might do a little messing around this afternoon - can you push if you have done anything?
[2025-01-18 01:34 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed
[2025-01-18 01:34 PM] Deciusmus: the full discord chat log is broken up into individual chats
[2025-01-18 01:35 PM] Deciusmus: and the 70% of it that is about git/obsidian/status tags/etc deleted (although I kept your version as the full chat log just for posterity)
[2025-01-18 01:35 PM] Deciusmus: I spent almost two hours at the bank trying to deposit Zachary's bar mitzvah checks but am now back home lookiing at this again
[2025-01-18 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: So pulling in all these emails and discord chats is making me think we would benefit from a somewhat better system from organizing "non-canon" background material
[2025-01-18 02:12 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm open to ideas, i don't have any brilliant suggestions myself
[2025-01-18 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: I'm poking around, will share ideas if I have any
[2025-01-18 02:18 PM] rsulfuratus: one thing i was thinking about while driving up here is that i like the style of the Multiverse page, which is written with a bit more 'in-world' color. 
    
    for things like people and gazetteer it doesn't necessarily make sense, but i was going to take a crack at rewriting a few of the cosmology pages in that style. 
    
    i was thinking specifically for cosmology - planes, religions, gods - what I'd really like are:
    (1) "in world" pages for publication written in the style of the Multiverse page
    (2) background pages in the main document set to excludePublish`["all"]` that represent canonical information about cosmology/planes/gods that doesn't make sense to publish
    (3) brainstorming pages
[2025-01-18 02:18 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe it is worth promoting brainstorming to a top-level directory?
[2025-01-18 02:19 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking perhaps the opposite, make Background a top level directory
[2025-01-18 02:19 PM] Deciusmus: and keep worldbuilding for "work in progress"
[2025-01-18 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2025-01-18 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: i kind of wonder though why we have things like "divine order" in background instead of cosmology
[2025-01-18 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: the original idea was just to make it easy to exclude from export but that seems a little pointless now since we can just excludePublish`["all"]`
[2025-01-18 02:20 PM] Deciusmus: right, for some specific pages like that, sure
[2025-01-18 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: Background is useful for random little canonical snippets that don't have another home though, I think. And also for more "meta" pages (Creating new Species)
[2025-01-18 02:24 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, okay, i think promoting background and then just treating anything in worldbuilding as non-canon makes sense
[2025-01-18 02:24 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm going to move background, but let you reorganize worldbuilding however you want, if you want
[2025-01-18 02:25 PM] Deciusmus: My other thought was that for "big" pages (like say Sembara or Tyrwingha) that have lots of `%%` comments, it is better to move the `%%` comments to a Sembara - Ideas (or whatever) document in brainstorming, rather than just a wall of comments in the main doc
[2025-01-18 02:26 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i was thinking same thing
[2025-01-18 02:26 PM] rsulfuratus: comments are really only good for inline discussion, having a big wall at the end is a bit hard to read
[2025-01-18 02:27 PM] rsulfuratus: my first project is going to be to reorganize cosmology to:
    (1) rewrite some pages in-world
    (2) move relevant pages from background to cosmology as needed, setting excludePublish
    (3) make a worldbuilding/cosmology directory for brainstorming info about cosmology, and move large comment blocks there
[2025-01-18 02:28 PM] rsulfuratus: don't know how much i'll actually do this afternoon but we'll see
[2025-01-18 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: the end state goal would be something like....
    
    On pages outside of Worldbuilding, anything on the page should be considered canon.
    Exceptions would be explicit comments that state something as non-canonical.
    In general, if there is a lot of unprocessed or non-canon information about a topic, make a worldubilding page (or folder) and link to it (ala a wikipedia talk page)
[2025-01-18 03:41 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a new version of astral plane, curious what you think about basic format of in-world scholarly discussion first, then a campaign:none block with "dm notes" and link to brainstorming pages
[2025-01-18 03:42 PM] Deciusmus: not seeing it
[2025-01-18 03:42 PM] Deciusmus: did you forget to push
[2025-01-18 03:42 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-01-18 03:42 PM] rsulfuratus: pushing now
[2025-01-18 03:45 PM] Deciusmus: I'm updating MOC to exclude worldbuilding from tag/dmnote stuff
[2025-01-18 03:45 PM] rsulfuratus: sensible. i think okay to occasionally stick a dm owner on brainstorming docs, but status tags and dm notes never make sense.
[2025-01-18 03:46 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, for the "counts" and "are all pages set with owners/notes/status" I wanted to exclude
[2025-01-18 03:47 PM] Deciusmus: I think that Astral Plane page is really good
[2025-01-18 03:48 PM] rsulfuratus: i am going to get carried away and invent tons of schools of metaphysical thought on taelgar i can tell
[2025-01-18 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: the dangling link to "planar dualism" is particularly juicy
[2025-01-18 03:53 PM] Deciusmus: I'm trying to clean up some `%%` comments on pages and move them to brainstorming. On for example the Sibyl's Hall page, there is an old comment  from One Note, but it seems to have been mostly incporated into the page
[2025-01-18 03:54 PM] Deciusmus: The only bit that hasn't is a hint that the reason it had declining funds had somethin to do with a change in the power of religious orders
[2025-01-18 03:54 PM] Deciusmus: Is that kind of note
    (a) worth keeping on the page as is
    (b) just delete it
    (c) move to a brainstorming doc
    (d) tag status/tim to see what you want to do
[2025-01-18 03:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i think something like that the implication is that the decline in power of religious orders was something i wasn't sure about and didnt come up in game. i think in that case - if is obvious - i'd leave a short comment like "potential reason for current day lack of funds: decline in power of religious orders" and otherwise delete the note
[2025-01-18 03:56 PM] rsulfuratus: but also fine to just tag status/check/tim and let me deal
[2025-01-18 04:10 PM] rsulfuratus: i would like to propose we move all the cosmology pages that describe locations within a plane, as opposed to planes themselve, to gazetteer, in an "extraplanar" section. i'm going to be adding lots of places in the feywild and the plane of fire, at least, and they are much more in the style of gazetteer pages than what i'm trting to do with cosmology
[2025-01-18 04:10 PM] Deciusmus: yeah makes sense to me
[2025-01-18 04:41 PM] Deciusmus: I'm trying to organize/cleaup history a bit
[2025-01-18 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: It should really be rewritten in your in-world style, but I don't have the time or energy for that
[2025-01-18 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: I did want to resolve the major "cleanup" note in the existing document, which is to restructure it to have only 3 "eras" rather than 4, i.e.
    
    (a) age before time
    (b) age of creation (riving - downfall)
    (c) age of humanity
[2025-01-18 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: someday i will probably do that but doesn't feel as useful as the cosmology stuff
[2025-01-18 04:43 PM] rsulfuratus: (put it in the in-world style)
[2025-01-18 04:43 PM] Deciusmus: But there is some debate in our discord chats about whether that is correct, or whether the creation of humanity was metaphyiscally significant. I think we agreed it wasn't, or if it was, it wasn't _as_ significant as the riving or the downfall, right?
[2025-01-18 04:43 PM] Deciusmus: that is, there was no interest in the creation of humanity being i.e. when the land of dead came into being or something like that
[2025-01-18 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-01-18 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: fundamentally the dividing lines are (a) riving and (b) destruction of hkar
[2025-01-18 04:45 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2025-01-18 05:20 PM] rsulfuratus: cosmology coming along. one organizational issue - I currently have "top level" pages for multiverse, the fundamental planes that don't fit elsewhere; and then directories for echo realms, spiritual realms, and energy realms.
    
    however there are also a lot of random notes mostly about how the planes connect to the material plane (e.g., extranplanar weak points) or about the material of the planes (e.g., soulstuff). 
    
    I guess these could all go into background, but some of them (extraplanar weak points for sure) seem kind of useful to publish, so i don't love that. 
    
    however I can't come up with a good name for a subdirectory that is "misc stuff connected to planes but not actually planes themselves"
[2025-01-18 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: Planar Concepts?
[2025-01-18 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: Background of the Multiverse?
[2025-01-18 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: I am running a D&D game for Z and his friends tonight so Ive mostly been prepping, but I am also working on the refactor of history. 
    
    The "age of creation" between riving and downfall works really well, because it is basically the age when almost everything was created
[2025-01-18 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: all sentient species, gods, etc were all created during the age of creation
[2025-01-18 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-01-18 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: i think my feeling we shouldn't use "age of x" though
[2025-01-18 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: i've been using (inconsistently) mythic history or days of myth for pre-Riving
[2025-01-18 05:23 PM] Deciusmus: yeah in the previous discord chat we decided to leave them in the background material for now, but that they were explicitly not in game terms
[2025-01-18 05:25 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a cosmology reorg
[2025-01-18 05:25 PM] rsulfuratus: going to try to finish all the top-level pages tonight
[2025-01-18 05:26 PM] rsulfuratus: But have to cook now. Enjoy the dangling links
[2025-01-18 05:26 PM] rsulfuratus: You can kind of piece together planar dualism if you squint
[2025-01-18 06:22 PM] rsulfuratus: have generally not been setting status/check/mike, although feel free to review and send me comments on planar pages (should be obvious which ones are updated). did set status/check/mike for Far Realms.
[2025-01-18 08:35 PM] rsulfuratus: really getting carried away with the in-world scholarship. just made up the Yendalist Heresy
[2025-01-18 08:40 PM] Deciusmus: do extraplaner weak points imply "outer realms"? I guess not, because Shadowfolds is mentioned
[2025-01-18 08:41 PM] rsulfuratus: no - elemental planes as well
[2025-01-18 08:42 PM] Deciusmus: It occured to me maybe there is an extraplanar weak point to the fey wild in the Cleenseau Wood
[2025-01-18 08:42 PM] Deciusmus: It would explain, potentially, the on-again-off-again portal, and the timing of it appearing after Cha'mutte's death is interesting.
[2025-01-18 08:42 PM] rsulfuratus: kate and i are doing the crossword now but will think a bit - i think we have some old discussion of this
[2025-01-18 08:42 PM] Deciusmus: we did have a discussion about it
[2025-01-18 08:43 PM] Deciusmus: Ultimately I think we decided the mechanics of portals are a bit unique and there is no particular reason one has to be "explained"
