# Discord DM – 2023-11-22

[2023-11-22 01:09 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed an update to repo with text from Google Docs almost entirely copied over
[2023-11-22 01:09 PM] rsulfuratus: tagged a few things status/docreview
[2023-11-22 01:09 PM] rsulfuratus: and added more stuff to brainstorming
[2023-11-22 01:42 PM] Deciusmus: Did you copy the Dunmar players guide
[2023-11-22 01:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i have a bunch of disorganized Dunmar notes in my DM section, going to try to move that all into the dunmar note today
[2023-11-22 01:56 PM] Deciusmus: what does "docreview" as status mean?
[2023-11-22 01:57 PM] Deciusmus: I was using status/check for things where I wanted you to confirm you were ok with something being canonical
[2023-11-22 01:57 PM] rsulfuratus: note is mostly raw text from googld docs that is probably out of date and needs to be incorporated
[2023-11-22 01:57 PM] rsulfuratus: i think separate than check which usually is a simpler review
[2023-11-22 01:58 PM] rsulfuratus: was mostly for me to tag a few notes to try to work on later today
[2023-11-22 02:00 PM] Deciusmus: BTW, I think we should remove "stub" from pages which are just headers or otherwise very minimal, but where it isn't clear that more information is needed
[2023-11-22 02:00 PM] Deciusmus: I was trying to use stub for things like Embry where obviously just a header is insufficient
[2023-11-22 02:00 PM] rsulfuratus: stub is supposed to mean "a header is enough, this is done"
[2023-11-22 02:00 PM] Deciusmus: ah, that isn't how I was using it at all
[2023-11-22 02:00 PM] rsulfuratus: but maybe it needs a different tag, or no tag?
[2023-11-22 02:01 PM] rsulfuratus: the status tags are definitely a work in progress
[2023-11-22 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i like having tags for:
    - this is a minor thing and the frontmatter is checked, skip it and move on
    - this is an important note but it is up to date with current lore
    - this needs work but primarily inventing stuff
    - this needs work but primarily digging through notes/emails/texts/comments
    - this needs review of various kinds
[2023-11-22 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: but i haven't really settled on a good shorthand
[2023-11-22 02:03 PM] rsulfuratus: also want a tag for "i'm not sure about the status of this thing"
[2023-11-22 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: I like having a tag to distinguish between:
    * this thing really needs invention before in-game use; something that needs attention vs
    * this thing is minor and doesn't really need invention before in-game use, but more details certainly could be added
[2023-11-22 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: maybe that's the same as your 1 and 3
[2023-11-22 02:05 PM] rsulfuratus: right, the reason i used stub was i was thinking this is something of course you could always add more detail to, but it doesn't need more detail
[2023-11-22 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: That's very much similar to my "minor and doesn't really need invention"
[2023-11-22 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: whereas 3 is "this is an important thing that has some questions about lore/canon"
[2023-11-22 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: Happy to use stub for that
[2023-11-22 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: But I'm not sure that say the Battle of Metium or Mithril is really "needswork"
[2023-11-22 02:07 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah my tagging is inconsistent
[2023-11-22 02:07 PM] rsulfuratus: battle of metium should really be notes, I have a few details in OneNote i want to transfer over
[2023-11-22 02:07 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2023-11-22 02:07 PM] rsulfuratus: mithril probably could be stub
[2023-11-22 02:08 PM] rsulfuratus: although my thinking there is do we want to establish the canon that mithril is equivalent to D&D standard (lets you make armor that is light/easy to where under clothes) or is there more to it in Taelgar?
[2023-11-22 02:08 PM] rsulfuratus: so maybe there should be another category for "unsettled questions but not important"
[2023-11-22 02:09 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. these are the kinds of things you can easily improvise general, overarching details about during a session
[2023-11-22 02:09 PM] rsulfuratus: which, I guess, is basiclly stub
[2023-11-22 02:20 PM] Deciusmus: To me, the most useful types of things to know are:
    
    * does this note represent broadly what is known about this topic or is there information elsewhere, either in notes or someone's head
    * does this note represent an important or unimportant topic
[2023-11-22 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: Where, in particular, for me, I want to shy away from making up lots of details about "important" topics on the spot
[2023-11-22 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: So for example mithril is something where:
    * the note represents everything that is known and 
    * the topic isn't very important
[2023-11-22 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think that is a good way to represent it
[2023-11-22 02:24 PM] rsulfuratus: for me, i also care about whether the "information elsewhere" is:
    - in my head or needs to be invented
    - in notes somewhere but not in Obsidian
    - in Obisidian in some form but needs some work to incorporate
[2023-11-22 02:24 PM] Deciusmus: Whereas say the note for Valit, a small town near Cleenseau:
    * is not very important but
    * the note doesn't represent everything that is known
[2023-11-22 02:24 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah strongly endorse that as well
[2023-11-22 02:25 PM] Deciusmus: and actually, at some level, I'm not sure I care that much about:
    
    * not very important but there are known details in Tim's head
    
    and
    
    * important but details need to be invented
[2023-11-22 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: they are both indicators that the note is potentially dangerously non-canonical
[2023-11-22 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, a little bit of informality and commonsense helps a lot as well
[2023-11-22 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: and actually maybe what I just said is wrong, in the sense that it matters where the details are
[2023-11-22 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: what i'm trying to say is something like:
    
    status/notes and
    status/needswork
    
    could do double duty. Is it important whether something needs work because it is just obviously incomplete or because someone's idly planning needs to be written down?
[2023-11-22 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: I also somewhat prefer not to try to have a "done" or "up to date" label
[2023-11-22 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: To me, a status label indicates there is some action on the note
[2023-11-22 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i'm not sure the uptodate is particularly useful
[2023-11-22 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: there is also no reason there can't be multiple status labels, so we don't have to agree on everything
[2023-11-22 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: right, of course
[2023-11-22 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: it is helpful to agree on a few key things that have specific meaning though
[2023-11-22 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2023-11-22 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: I think I'd propose a basic set:
    
    status/needswork 
    means that this note does not contain all of the information about this topic and shouldn't be treated as "complete"
    
    status/draft
    means that this note is largely complete but could use a second opinion  / review before being considered canonical. Might need agreement before removing draft status
    
    status/check
    this note has a comment about consistency accuracy and needs someone to do a check 
    
    status/refactor
    this note appears to be "accurate and complete" at first glance, but it represents something that needs rethinking
[2023-11-22 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: perhaps also a status/unknown
[2023-11-22 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: for "not sure what the status is"
[2023-11-22 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe also
    
    status/stub for "I just created this page because I was filling in back links or empty spots on the map but I don't know anything about it and its up for grabs"
[2023-11-22 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: i.e.
    
    status/needswork means "important and incomplete"
    status/stub means "unimportant and incomplete"
[2023-11-22 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: that seems reasonable. i would also add optional:
    - status/needswork/notes (information from non-obsidian notes needs to be incorporated)
    - status/needswork/wip (details need to be invented)
    - status/needswork/internal (mostly needs cross-check against other notes and/or incorporating comments in the note itself)
[2023-11-22 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: internal could be crosscheck or something else
[2023-11-22 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2023-11-22 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: the main useful thing here is that if you tag something in sembara needswork, it is helpful for me to known if that means you need to pull information from somewhere, or there are details that are not settled
[2023-11-22 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that makes sense
[2023-11-22 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: Although a `%%` comment can be helpful as well
[2023-11-22 02:41 PM] rsulfuratus: internal is also useful before theoretically anyone can work on that even if it isn't "their" area; ideally we'd also add comments to here
[2023-11-22 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, comments are great, but if I have 20 minutes and want to work on something it is nice to have a way to sort the needswork tags without having to open each note
[2023-11-22 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: yes, agreed
[2023-11-22 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: it's just sometimes hard to distinguish
[2023-11-22 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2023-11-22 02:43 PM] rsulfuratus: finally on status/refactor - does this mean refactor related to the page structure or note organization (this is how i've used it)
    or more like "rethink" - there are details here that I'm not sure should be canon
[2023-11-22 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: Ah, maybe rethink is better
[2023-11-22 02:43 PM] rsulfuratus: I think I'd use refactor just for the first, and have the second be a different tag
[2023-11-22 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-11-22 02:43 PM] rsulfuratus: rethink is good
[2023-11-22 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: agreed
[2023-11-22 02:53 PM] rsulfuratus: Here is what I have, putting this on a page:
    
    
    - `**`status/needswork**: this note does not contain all of the information about this topic and shouldn't be treated as "complete." optional secondary tags include:
        - `**`notes**: additional details exist and are recorded in non-Obsidian notes or in someone's head, but haven't yet been captured in Obsidian
        - `**`wip**: additional details need to invented
        - `**`internal**: additional details exist in Obsidian, e.g. in the form of dates on other notes, comments in the note itself, etc, but haven't been fully incorporated into the note text
    - `**`status/draft**: this note is largely complete but could use a second opinion / review before being considered canonical. Might need agreement before removing draft status.
    - `**`status/check**: this note has a comment about consistency accuracy and needs someone to do a check
    - `**`status/refactor**: this note has something about it that is not well captured by current Obsidian note organization, and might benefit from refactoring note structure (examples could be narrative history notes that should be refactored into timelines; or item notes that mix general and specific lore)
    - `**`status/rethink**: note is relatively complete but there are details that might need to be rethought; best to include a comment here
    - **status/stub** for "I just created this page because I was filling in back links or empty spots on the map but I don't know anything about it and its up for grabs"
    - **status/unknown** for the status of the note is unclear
[2023-11-22 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: actually wondering if status/stub is useful
[2023-11-22 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: sounds good
[2023-11-22 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: I guess the absence of needswork is good enough
[2023-11-22 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, don't need to judge whether something is "minor enough" for a status/stub tag
[2023-11-22 02:55 PM] rsulfuratus: however I'd say since this relies on the absence of tags to have meaning, probably should start by just marking all notes as status/unknown
[2023-11-22 02:55 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that is reasonable
[2023-11-22 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: then i'd suggest for npcs, only remove the unknown tag if it is "your" npc, although feel free to add other tags if it seems reasonably clear
[2023-11-22 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i will use the tag thing to push this. i'm not going to change any existing tags, just add status/unknown
[2023-11-22 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: so presence of unknown implies status tags are not  reliable
[2023-11-22 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: are you going to push a tags cleanup as well?
[2023-11-22 03:02 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-11-22 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: ok, I will wait to do anything til that is pushed
[2023-11-22 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: to avoid merge conflict
[2023-11-22 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: give me a few minutes
[2023-11-22 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: yeah no rush, I have  a few work emails I still need to respond to, I will do that 🙂
[2023-11-22 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: it is actually a bit tricky, can't do it in obisidian, so modifying my taelgar-utils to have an "add tag" function
[2023-11-22 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: do you care if I just tag all notes (outside of `_` directories), or should I exclude things like session notes?
[2023-11-22 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: as a side effect this should fix the long-format yaml
[2023-11-22 03:43 PM] Deciusmus: you can tag everything

[2023-11-22 03:43 PM] Deciusmus: any idea?
[2023-11-22 03:44 PM] rsulfuratus: by default appends your obisidan vault location (in the config.json) to the input dir
[2023-11-22 03:44 PM] rsulfuratus: try:
    `python taelgar_utils.py --output c:\temp\workingspace --dview  --campaign Clee -v .`
[2023-11-22 03:45 PM] rsulfuratus: as long as you have "c:\Users\msackton\personal\OneDrive\taelgar" in the config.json file
[2023-11-22 03:45 PM] Deciusmus: ah, I need a config.json?
[2023-11-22 03:45 PM] Deciusmus: missed this
    >` The `taelgar_utils.py` requires a `config.json` which specifies, at the moment, only the obsidian_path (which should be an absolute path to the root of your Taelgar obsidian folder).
[2023-11-22 03:46 PM] rsulfuratus: there should be an example the repo
[2023-11-22 03:46 PM] rsulfuratus: `python taelgar_utils.py --help` should be fairly complete as well
[2023-11-22 03:49 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed tag update
[2023-11-22 03:51 PM] Deciusmus: can you give me write permission to taelgar_utils
[2023-11-22 03:51 PM] Deciusmus: had to fix one bug
[2023-11-22 03:51 PM] Deciusmus: one place you forgot to open the file with utf8 encoding
[2023-11-22 03:51 PM] Deciusmus: windows default encoding is... not smart
[2023-11-22 03:52 PM] rsulfuratus: done
[2023-11-22 04:03 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm going to add a `status/secret` tag for "I'm actively inventing this for the Dunmar campaign"
[2023-11-22 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, I already use the presence of a 
    
    `%%`SECRET`[]``%%`
    
    to indicate "there is more to this note then mets the eye"
[2023-11-22 04:04 PM] rsulfuratus: right, just something like "merfolk" doesn't have any secret information in it yet
[2023-11-22 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2023-11-22 04:04 PM] rsulfuratus: but obviously is going to come up when you go to the jade garden
[2023-11-22 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-11-22 04:06 PM] Deciusmus: any reason to keep the dufr/unaware on random cleenseau npcs I'm cleaning up?
[2023-11-22 04:06 PM] rsulfuratus: no, delete that
[2023-11-22 04:06 PM] rsulfuratus: not using it anymore
[2023-11-22 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: Also do you prefer having disambiguation built in or only add if needed? i.e. do you add " of XXX" or other descriptors when creating people with minimal name info?
[2023-11-22 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: or wait for a name conflict
[2023-11-22 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: no clear preference. i think if they'd go by that in-world or if there is likely to be a name conflict, no reason not to just add it if you feel like it, but don't have to be systematic about it
[2023-11-22 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: and just to confirm, absence of status tag = "as much information as exists about this place is in the note"
[2023-11-22 04:15 PM] rsulfuratus: one more comment - I am documenting things that are probably true but not confirmed in game in comments, instead of text, e.g. for Dreamhaven:
    ```
    `%%` notes
    Many elves who fled the destruction of Ainumarya fled here, according to Caelynn
    `%%`
    ```
[2023-11-22 04:17 PM] Deciusmus: I think the key thing is the audience of notes is `[Mike, Tim]` whereas the audience of body text is `[Mike, Tim, Players]`
[2023-11-22 04:17 PM] Deciusmus: >` and just to confirm, absence of status tag = "as much information as exists about this place is in the note"
    
    Yes that is my intention
[2023-11-22 04:17 PM] rsulfuratus: yes. 
    
    i don't want to put things that are kind in a state of quantum uncertainty in the actual text, but also want that information to be available, e.g. if you are using the elf I made up and they are talking about where their people went, "they've heard rumors that many ended up in Dreamhaven" is useful to have
[2023-11-22 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: what's the right status for a page that has some upcoming campaign-important info but that "broadly" doesn't need more info
[2023-11-22 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. an NPC I have plans for in the next session
[2023-11-22 04:34 PM] rsulfuratus: could just use status/secret, same idea even if it isn't actually "secret"
[2023-11-22 04:35 PM] rsulfuratus: or could use status/inprogress or something
[2023-11-22 04:35 PM] Deciusmus: I actually like just using status/secret
[2023-11-22 04:35 PM] Deciusmus: basically a short hand for "DM-specific info pending"
[2023-11-22 04:35 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2023-11-22 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: honestly, it is probably better to use status/needswork/secret or status/needswork/campaign
[2023-11-22 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-11-22 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: I then have the luxury of making it status/needswork/internal if I just dump my DM notes in the note itself
[2023-11-22 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: We should probably reserve internal for "all the relevant info is IN the note, it just isn't properly integrated"
[2023-11-22 04:37 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-11-22 04:37 PM] rsulfuratus: i do need a tag for "needs cross-checking"
[2023-11-22 04:37 PM] rsulfuratus: status/factcheck
[2023-11-22 04:37 PM] Deciusmus: isn't that status/check
[2023-11-22 04:37 PM] rsulfuratus: status/check is "other person should look at something in a commet"
[2023-11-22 04:37 PM] Deciusmus: maybe we should use
    
    status/draft for "other person should look"
    
    and
    
    status/check for "needs fact checking"
[2023-11-22 04:38 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2023-11-22 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: or status/factcheck for needs fact checking
[2023-11-22 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: That makes it more clear, i.e. I can add
    
    status/draft 
    
    to Twlight's Grace 
    
    with a note bout what I want you to check.
    
    Or you could add
    status/draft
    to a note about Sembaran history
    
    or whatever
[2023-11-22 04:39 PM] Deciusmus: whereas status/factcheck can be resolved by the person who added it if you take the time to find the fact.
[2023-11-22 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: it's a bit easy to get carried away:
![[../_discord_assets/image-11218.png]]
[2023-11-22 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2023-11-22 04:44 PM] Deciusmus: But I love the ablity to create tables of where people are:
[2023-11-22 04:45 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-959DD.png]]
[2023-11-22 04:57 PM] rsulfuratus: do you know of a way to create a table of all the people that have backlinks to a specific page? e.g. to auto-generate a "relationships" section
[2023-11-22 04:58 PM] Deciusmus: file.inlinks
[2023-11-22 04:58 PM] Deciusmus: but I haven't figured out the exact details
[2023-11-22 04:58 PM] Deciusmus: something lke
    
    file.inlinks.some(f =>` f.name == dv.current().file.name)
[2023-11-22 04:58 PM] Deciusmus: wait, I'm not sure if that is right
[2023-11-22 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: no, it is
[2023-11-22 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: inlinks is the other pages that link to this page
[2023-11-22 05:12 PM] rsulfuratus: ```dataview
    LIST FROM #person WHERE contains(file.inlinks, this.file.link)
    ```
[2023-11-22 05:15 PM] rsulfuratus: better:
    ```
    LIST FROM #person WHERE contains(file.outlinks, this.file.link) OR contains(file.inlinks, this.file.link)
    ```
[2023-11-22 05:15 PM] rsulfuratus: gets all people linked to page, or that page links to
[2023-11-22 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: can make this cleaner but this is a start:
[2023-11-22 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-C365C.png]]
[2023-11-22 05:24 PM] rsulfuratus: ```
    TABLE choice(species, species, typeof) as Info
    FROM #person OR #organization 
    WHERE contains(file.outlinks, this.file.link) OR contains(file.inlinks, this.file.link)
    SORT choice(species, species, typeof)
    ```
[2023-11-22 05:30 PM] rsulfuratus:

[2023-11-22 05:31 PM] rsulfuratus: ```dataview
    TABLE WITHOUT ID choice(contains(file.tags,"organization"), "Organization", "Person") as Type, name as Name, choice(species, species, typeof) as Info, file.link as Link
    FROM #person OR #organization 
    WHERE contains(file.outlinks, this.file.link) OR contains(file.inlinks, this.file.link)
    SORT choice(species, species, typeof)
    ```
[2023-11-22 05:44 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-6D5AA.png]]
[2023-11-22 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: what page
![[../_discord_assets/image-A10CD.png]]
[2023-11-22 05:50 PM] rsulfuratus: callie charmheart
[2023-11-22 05:50 PM] rsulfuratus: added a finished pages note and a pages that need work note
[2023-11-22 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: making dinner
[2023-11-22 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-559A0.png]]
[2023-11-22 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: so afk for a while
[2023-11-22 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, I'm going to go make dinner as well
[2023-11-22 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: the location is a nice addition
[2023-11-22 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-7622C.png]]
[2023-11-22 06:04 PM] Deciusmus: Here's Agata
![[../_discord_assets/image-8227E.png]]
[2023-11-22 06:05 PM] Deciusmus: Caelynn, with items included
![[../_discord_assets/image-81CC9.png]]
[2023-11-22 06:05 PM] Deciusmus: the code is a bit messy, will try to check it in later
[2023-11-22 06:05 PM] Deciusmus: ```dataviewjs
    const { util } = customJS
    dv.table(`["Type", "Name", "Info", "Location"]`, 
                dv.pages("#person or #organization or #place or #item")
                    .where(f =>` util.isLinkedToPerson(f.file, dv.current().file))
                    .sort(b =>`util.getType(b))
                    .map(b =>` `[util.getType(b), util.getName(b.file.name), util.getInfoLine(b), util.getLoc(b)]`))
                    
    ```
[2023-11-22 09:13 PM] Deciusmus: I think status/stub is useful for pages that need full header info and a sentence but not much else
[2023-11-22 09:13 PM] rsulfuratus: how hard would it be to make this frontmatter:
    ```
    campaignInfo: 
    - { campaign: Wellby, date: 1748-09-30, type: met}
    - { campaign: Wellby, date: 1748-10-12, type: last seen}
    ```
    generate these lines:
    ```
    >`>` `%%`^Campaign:dufr`%%` Met by [[Wellby]] on September 30th, 1748 on the [[Wave Dancer]], the [[Eastern Green Sea]] `%%`^End`%%`
    >`>` `%%`^Campaign:dufr`%%` Last seen by [[Wellby]] on October 12th, 1748 on the [[Wave Dancer]], [[Wahacha]], the [[Vermillion Isles]] `%%`^End`%%`
    ```
[2023-11-22 09:13 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. instead of Campaign:Wellby
[2023-11-22 09:14 PM] Deciusmus: For example I was completing the page on the Aben River in Tyrwingha, and decided to make up the name of the river it joins with. But I did not want to set all the frontmatter corretly
[2023-11-22 09:14 PM] Deciusmus: that wouldn't be hard at all
[2023-11-22 09:14 PM] Deciusmus: would need some sort of mapping somewhere to map prefix to some other prefix
[2023-11-22 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: what you probably want instead though is a person:
[2023-11-22 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: i.e.
    
    campaignInfo: 
    - { campaign: dufr, person: Wellby, date: 1748-09-30, type: met}
[2023-11-22 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: that's easier and just says: if the person is specified, use getName of that
[2023-11-22 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: instead of getName of DuFr
[2023-11-22 09:18 PM] Deciusmus: I have some other JS changes in flight I dont want to push, but if you change
    
    whereaboutsManager.js
    
    getPartyMeeting
    
    let partyName = ...
    
    to 
            let person = element.person ?? element.campaign
                        let partyName = NameManager.getName(person, NameManager.CreateLink, NameManager.PreserveCase)
    It should work
[2023-11-22 09:18 PM] rsulfuratus: got it
[2023-11-22 09:18 PM] rsulfuratus: will test and push
[2023-11-22 09:20 PM] rsulfuratus: there are a few other formatting tweaks that would be nice, e.g. having control over displayDefaults in the whereabouts line, so that if someone has two homes (e.g. Vistra), you can change Based in: to Properitor of: only for second home, stuff like that
[2023-11-22 09:20 PM] rsulfuratus: but nothing urgent
[2023-11-22 09:24 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking for Properitor of using leaderOf
[2023-11-22 09:24 PM] rsulfuratus: oh, yeah, that's good
[2023-11-22 09:24 PM] Deciusmus: leaderOf: `[ { place: The Name Of Inn, title: Properitor }]` should work
[2023-11-22 09:32 PM] rsulfuratus: doesn't work for me, but not sure if i have out of date code or what
[2023-11-22 09:32 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a fix so that start: 0001 for leaderOf works
[2023-11-22 09:32 PM] Deciusmus: You need a start date
[2023-11-22 09:33 PM] Deciusmus: I should fix it so it doesn’t require a date at all
[2023-11-22 09:33 PM] Deciusmus: But at the moment it requires reignStart in frontmatter or start: in the leaderOf line
[2023-11-22 09:35 PM] Deciusmus: I just pushed a fix so that at least start: 0001 means “no start display” rather than show something weird
[2023-11-22 09:35 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, got that
[2023-11-22 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: that's pretty nice
[2023-11-22 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus:
