[2024-07-11 08:46 PM] rsulfuratus: it isn't quite done, but the magic item rework in obsidian is shaping to do the following:
    1) make pages for everything that is either (a) a specific item, whether unique or not, with a story; or (b) a generic class of items, such as "Drankorian message stones" or "dragonhide armor"
    2) move all secrets for the Dunmar campaign to individual item pages or to "hoard pages", which would be the summary of all the items from a particular adventure or arc
    3) clean up party treasure to be easier to read and edit
    
    one issue so far is that we currently don't have a clear way to distinguish between types of items and specific items. currently this is just by folder, with things/magic items being generic things that have many copies in the world (workshop items from previous discussion), and things/artifacts of power or dunmar frontier/treasure/notable items having unique things (whether actually unique or historically/lore unique).
    
    not sure if there is a better way to do this
[2024-07-11 08:50 PM] Deciusmus: there probably is but I don't have time to think about it this week
[2024-07-11 08:50 PM] Deciusmus: realistically, for "item types" you probably don't have whereabouts, creator, etc
[2024-07-11 08:51 PM] Deciusmus: but also, if you just don't set them, then... fine
[2024-07-11 08:51 PM] rsulfuratus: right, at the moment i'm just assuming things are obivious from the text, which is good for now I think
