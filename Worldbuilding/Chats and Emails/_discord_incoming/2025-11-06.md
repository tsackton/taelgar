[2025-11-06 08:33 AM] rsulfuratus: no, i don't think it has always existed
[2025-11-06 08:34 AM] rsulfuratus: i don't have a strong opinion on whether it has changed character or not... but my kind of vague vibes based sense is that it isn't exactly a prison, but it actually some kind of powerful entity solidified and bound. the moon doesn't contain something, it *is* something
[2025-11-06 08:35 AM] rsulfuratus: which would imply it has not changed character
[2025-11-06 08:37 AM] rsulfuratus: the kind of very rough background vibe that i was thinking about during the limbo arc was that a feature of the primoridal cosmos was that a lot of powerful beings would reshape it all the time, in a way similar to the idea of fey realms but much more dramatic and constant. this would lead to conflict - e.g. the war between "order" and "chaos". a key aspect of the riving and where some - but not all - planes come from is the desire to banish / contain these powerful forces
[2025-11-06 08:38 AM] rsulfuratus: the vibe of limbo - not sure if it fully came across - is that in some sense it was created by the Divine Presence as a prison for the forces of chaos
[2025-11-06 08:38 AM] rsulfuratus: mechanus (might change the name) has the same vibe but for order
[2025-11-06 08:39 AM] rsulfuratus: arborea and anti-arborea might end up with the same metaphysics, and you could imagine maybe one more set of paired/opposing forces although i'm not sure what that would be yet
[2025-11-06 08:39 AM] rsulfuratus: the point of this though is that i think in my mind, the moon has a similar vibe, although very different mechanics
[2025-11-06 08:40 AM] rsulfuratus: but i'm not set in stone on this if you have a different idea
[2025-11-06 08:42 AM] rsulfuratus: i also at one point had a totally different idea, very vague and ill formed but something about there once being more moons, perhaps pre-downfall, and somehow the surviving moon was involved for good or ill in the downfall wars and is somehow tied to the destruction and reshaping that occurred then (which doesn't currently have a metaphysical explanation the way the reshaping after cha'mutte's death does)
[2025-11-06 08:44 AM] rsulfuratus: (but i kind of abandoned that idea as it felt harder to connect to planar tides, which was the one canonically established fact about the moon)
[2025-11-06 08:45 AM] Deciusmus: I'm actually mostly trying to understand in some vague sense why there is no moon in the feywild, and a bit about te relationship between fey and the moon
[2025-11-06 08:45 AM] Deciusmus: which might be - none at all
[2025-11-06 08:46 AM] rsulfuratus: well, maybe there is a moon in the feywild but you can only see it from the other side of the world
[2025-11-06 08:46 AM] rsulfuratus: i think all that is established in game is there is no moon in ethlenn's realm
[2025-11-06 08:46 AM] Deciusmus: true
[2025-11-06 08:47 AM] rsulfuratus: interestingly in the wellby solo Arryn the Wanderer gave wellby a fey locket that always showed the phase of the moon. that was pretty far east, well into night.
[2025-11-06 08:47 AM] rsulfuratus: the game logic was a timepiece in places where time ran funny but it could have other implications
[2025-11-06 08:48 AM] rsulfuratus: that said, i don't think the moon has any tidal effect on the feywild
[2025-11-06 08:48 AM] rsulfuratus: which the fey might actually interpret as further evidence that the mundane world is an echo realm of the feywild
[2025-11-06 08:50 AM] rsulfuratus: there is a whole set of open questions about why exactly the feywild works the way it does w/r/t celestial bodies, which i invented just because it felt cool and gave the feywild a unique vibe but does kind imply some kind of metaphysics i haven't figured out yet
[2025-11-06 08:53 AM] rsulfuratus: i guess my position would be:
    - the moon doesn't affect the feywild in the same way as the material plane, though in-world there is a lot of debate about what that actually means. but there are not planar tides on the feywild in the same way as the material plane (though there is clearly space for shifting portals and such)
    - the fey in the part of taelgar explored by campaigns to date don't have a moon in their sky, but this does not necessarily mean there is no moon in the feywild, just that if it exists it would be far to the east
    - some fey might be interested in the moon, but at least as far as we know this is just from a beauty/curiosity standpoint and not because there is any metaphysical reason for fey specifically to care about the moon
[2025-11-06 08:54 AM] rsulfuratus: and, adding: the fey are unlikely to have any special knowledge about the moon, except that some of them are very, very old and might remember ancient events, some powerful fey probably existed in some sense before the riving
[2025-11-06 08:59 AM] Deciusmus: I do like the basic sense that the moon _is_ something. I don't think it is important to resolve whether or not it is the _only_ something or the only surviving something
[2025-11-06 09:02 AM] Deciusmus: but I would guess that hints or vibes that suggest the moon:
    * might have existed in some form before the Riving but as some type of entity, rather than a moon in the sky
    * has some connection to the separating of the planes (i.e. maybe the moon still has parts in each of the realms in some fashion, which causes planar tides)
    
    are sensible, although for the moment anything I suggest in game is going to be couched in mystery and vagueness and hints or rumors, so easy for them to be wrong or misinterpreted
[2025-11-06 09:03 AM] rsulfuratus: yes i agree with both those points
[2025-11-06 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: Do you have playlists on Spotify or something for music?
[2025-11-06 02:13 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. if i had time i'd make my own but usually just search up various dnd ambient things
[2025-11-06 02:14 PM] Deciusmus: Also did you see my mostreve army update? I need to do some more invention asap because it will come up on Sunday I suspect but wondering what you thought of the basic direction
[2025-11-06 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it basically makes sense. this has some overlap with rangers structure (where 'armies' organize around specific commanders by choice), and also with the general sense of addermarch where the army to the extent it exists is really the household of the earl and the knights who owe allegiance to the earl. which makes sense as i think our sense is that at least one important strand of the rangers emerges from border guerillas in the addmarch area. 
    
    so to me it all fits together to have this kind of loose structure be characteristic of a lot of the southern tier of greater sembara.
[2025-11-06 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: sembara is a bit of the odd one out with a tradition of beaurocratic organization that probably developed under derk iii during the great war (or perhaps a bit in the build up, under derk i)
[2025-11-06 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: yeah... although I wonder if actually the Radiant ALliance was the source of the current sembaran army
[2025-11-06 02:27 PM] rsulfuratus: also possible. i guess under derik it might have been more just a bunch of disparate things under command of a single brilliant general
[2025-11-06 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: right. I'm not sure. I have this idea that Derik I actually built the army that defeated avatus around the Tyrwinghan border guard / fey-touched warlock cadre
[2025-11-06 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that is plausible or even likely. the great war armies though were very extensive
[2025-11-06 02:32 PM] Deciusmus: right. it seems like either one of the early monarchs (I dont have notes open, the person after Derik I) organized a professional army around the Great War, or Cece organized it around the Radiant Alliance.
[2025-11-06 02:32 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure it matters, but probably the first one makes a bit more sense, although I'm not sure why the early Sewicks wouldn't have tried to professionalize the Tyrwinghan army as well
[2025-11-06 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. some of the vibes of the monarchs between derik i and derik iii might need tweaking, e.g. not sure why charlotte i (derik iii mom and queen before him) woudl get the highland realms to accept her as overking. i mean there could be world events there but also it could really be derik iii who does everything. he comes to the throne in 1519 after great success fighting vimfrost in the north, so has time before the great war starts.
[2025-11-06 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: that said after derik iii dies things quickly fall apart and it seems likely that any early army professionalization started by derik iii or charlotte i might not persist
[2025-11-06 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: There was a whole set of events in "a chronicle of sembara history" that explains Charolette's reign, but it is not clear if it should be canoncal
[2025-11-06 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: at the time I wrote that I was aiming for a "just-so" story that would result in Derik III being the overking of a vast area, to align with Great War pseudo-history, and was trying to avoid it _all_ being down to him
[2025-11-06 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: but more recent invention might make it preferable to have some of these places more lightly touched by Sembara
[2025-11-06 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: right. i think it is really the highland kingdoms. vimfrost's war is well established and derik iii's role clears the way for him to be nominally acknowledged as some kind of loose overking of vostok for a very brief period. 
    
    the highland kingdoms have always been a little unplaced imo, at least in my mind. they are a little too undeveloped to have a clear sense of where they fit in history. but maybe it doesn't matter (or maybe we'll invent more tonight that is relevant)
[2025-11-06 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: Yes, I agree
[2025-11-06 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: I'd treat the whole set of timelines around the highland kingdoms as not necessarily canonical
[2025-11-06 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: the Tyrwinghan interaction I think is pretty solid...
    
    Derik I, II, Charlotte I, Derik III all are part of a joint crown with Tyrwingha basically due to Ethlenn herself crowning Derik I as the king of Tyrwingha
[2025-11-06 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: (perhaps because she foresaw the Great War in some way, although thats not canonical)
[2025-11-06 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: after the Great War, Tyrwingha declares a new monarch, not Bertram I / Jane regent.
[2025-11-06 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that works well and is well established too
[2025-11-06 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: Then the crowns are separate, until the Anne/Elaine "twin war"
[2025-11-06 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: where Elaine had married into the Tyrwinghan throne, and actually it is just her children that really inherit the throne
[2025-11-06 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: But this is the long period of 2nd hobgoblin war / 3rd hobgolbin war / peace of cece, 1590s - 1710s where the crowns are united again
[2025-11-06 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: and then the brief lich period, when they are separated, and then reunited again in 1720 - modern day
[2025-11-06 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. i think the greater sembara vibe is basically split into three pieces:
    
    - tyrwingha, which is a personal union of the crowns driven by ethlenn 
    - addermarch / vostok / maybe masseau or whatever is there in 1500s, which is basically allied command during ww2 but with derik III as the supreme commander
    - highland kingdoms which are ??? and don't really fit well
[2025-11-06 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2025-11-06 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: I think Maseau was a duchy after Avatus, although always a bit outside the main politics of Sembara (and it has always been that the duchies are really key units, in many ways "the Duchy of Wisford" or "the Duchy of Telham" are just as much places of identity as "Sembara")
[2025-11-06 02:48 PM] Deciusmus: but Maseau was "part of sembara" in the same way, say "Normandy" was part of England just after the norman conquest
[2025-11-06 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: right
