# Discord DM – 2024-01-17

[2024-01-17 01:14 PM] Deciusmus: I am taking a little break from work to do some taelgar stuff during lunch, I have been thinking about the highland kingdoms and trying to write something up. 
    
    Do you have any sense about how far east into Vostok the “highland culture” goes? Or about what the northern Vos are like?
[2024-01-17 01:14 PM] rsulfuratus: yes I do have a sense of this. in a meeting now though
[2024-01-17 02:34 PM] rsulfuratus: so basic outline - open to revision
    - northerners cross mountains pre-downfall, up north, kind of around where blackwater fens is now, into the plains that are now kenku homeland
    - they slowly spread out, trickling across the forests of inland sembara, vos, and further east, basically sticking to the forests/highlands
    - in the coasts/lowlands/river valleys mix with mariners, creating a variety of cultures (lowland sembara, tyrwingha, skaer)
    - lowland cultures (minus skaer) are more influenced by drankor than highland cultures
    - so this gives you basically a band spreading all the way from sentinels to some unknown point east of "northerner" culture, with some variations
    - my main feeling is that three primary events drive variation among the northerners
    
    1. initial spread: there is likely some variation in the initial spread, with different groups and traditions creating an initial baseline level of differentiation. mostly, i think the people who made it past the Sivnjo mountains are from a related but distinct cultural tradition that the people of Sembara/Vos
    
    2. mariner interactions: the sembaran highlanders don't interact with mariners as much as the Vos
    
    3. skaer interactions: the skaer have considerable influence in two time periods, first in the time after the downfall when the skaer are dominant in the western gulf and conquer tollen/establish an empire; second in the early sembaran period when skaer raid frequently on the coasts
[2024-01-17 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: i think in the current day this leads to:
    - sembaran highland culture that stretches to the "lakes region" of eastern inland vos, largely uninfluenced by anyone 
    - a lowlander vos culture with strong "northern" and "skaer" and "drankorian" influences, may be a mix of kestavo and mos numena, for example, but mostly restricted along the coasts, from say the volta east
    - an "interior" vos culture, which was greatly influenced by the skaer empire when the skaer would raid/sail/conquer up the rivers, but probably shares a religion with highlanders (e.g. are kestavan)
    - might also be room for others, e.g. the lowland vos may be geographically split between kestavan and mos numean traditions; the "wall culture" could be something yet again separate; an interior vos culture that largely fled the skaer expansion and has a more mariner offshoot but inland vibe (perhaps analogous a bit to britons vs anglo-saxons)
[2024-01-17 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: but to answer your specific question, the highlander culture probably spreads into northeastern vostok in particular in the area around the lakes, but not much further
[2024-01-17 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: Here's a rough map I drew:
    
    Red = "Zimka" northern culture
    Green = "mariner"
    Blue = "Vos" northern culture (to the extent it is different from Zimka, could be the same)
    Yellow = Lizardfolk swamp
![[../_discord_assets/image-F3308.png]]
[2024-01-17 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: Undetermined is how humans got to Tyrwinha, map is not meant to implement it was lizardfolk
[2024-01-17 02:41 PM] rsulfuratus: i think when people settle, the vos and zimka cultures are not really distinct, and probably spread all the way south across mostreve hills and into tyrwingha
[2024-01-17 02:41 PM] rsulfuratus: this is pre-downfall, pre-mariner
[2024-01-17 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: I thought we had a giant lizardfolk swamp ?
[2024-01-17 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: sure but it doesn't reach all the way to the sentinels
[2024-01-17 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: covers basically of the sembaran lowlands
[2024-01-17 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: and tyrwingha
[2024-01-17 02:43 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway the point isn't about tyrwingha
[2024-01-17 02:43 PM] rsulfuratus: point is that i think at the initial migration of northern cultures from the east over the mountains, you really get two (for now) cultural strands
[2024-01-17 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: So maybe more like this (pre-mariner)
![[../_discord_assets/image-7B550.png]]
[2024-01-17 02:44 PM] rsulfuratus: basically the logic being three variants of "northern folk religions" feels like a good initial number
[2024-01-17 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: blue = "vos"
    red = "zimka"
    yellow = lizardfolk
    green = elves
[2024-01-17 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: swamp goes further north, as far as the volta at least
[2024-01-17 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: but yes
[2024-01-17 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: actually had the idea at one point that the western gulf didn't even exist pre-downfall, or was much smaller
[2024-01-17 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: tbd when you go explore the canyon with the portal to the plane of water down there
[2024-01-17 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: Doesn't Tollen predate the downfall? I think the swamp probably goes to the Teft
[2024-01-17 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-1C0CD.png]]
[2024-01-17 02:46 PM] rsulfuratus: right, sure, maybe not quite to the volta
[2024-01-17 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: but the details don't really matter
[2024-01-17 02:46 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah anyway my point is you don't really have two distinct cultures that show up in vos/zimka
[2024-01-17 02:47 PM] rsulfuratus: there is the zimka vs "east of Sivnjo" distinction where there might be different variants of the northern folk religions
[2024-01-17 02:47 PM] rsulfuratus: but the whole interior highlands are kestavan
[2024-01-17 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: ah, I see. So you want the blue and red to be the same
[2024-01-17 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: that makes sense
[2024-01-17 02:47 PM] rsulfuratus: at this point in history yes
[2024-01-17 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: then distinctions really arise from interactions with mariners, drankor, and skaer
[2024-01-17 02:48 PM] Deciusmus: then you have something like this (fuschia = mariner culture)
![[../_discord_assets/image-74D07.png]]
[2024-01-17 02:49 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah the details of the history can be a little fuzzy but the idea is you have the zimka who basically remain pretty isolated and self-contained throughout their history, and then vos being a bit more of a mixing ground
[2024-01-17 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: then you end up with something broadly like this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-F2D02.png]]
[2024-01-17 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: where fuschia - zimka, more isolated, esp by drankor (red)
[2024-01-17 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: green - skaer
[2024-01-17 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: blue = what becomes vos
[2024-01-17 02:51 PM] rsulfuratus: right, yes
[2024-01-17 02:51 PM] rsulfuratus: vos ends up with at least three dominant cultures, although room for more
[2024-01-17 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: a lowland vos culture that is dominant in the lower river valleys and coast that might even be mos numenan (tbd)
[2024-01-17 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: a highland vos culture that is dominant in the northeast of the country that is mariner influenced and skaer influenced but less drankor
[2024-01-17 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: the zimka culture in the volta headwaters and east across the "lakes region"
[2024-01-17 02:53 PM] Deciusmus: Right, but I don't know that the Zimka culture is "part of Vostok"
[2024-01-17 02:53 PM] rsulfuratus: Vostok is kind of an artfact of drankorian mapmakers and sembaran nationalists, though
[2024-01-17 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: like, maybe isn't a real place from the point of view of the vos
[2024-01-17 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: The reason for all this is to better establish the "highland" kingdoms -- and I'm leaning toward the idea that there are three actual kingdoms (Ardlas, Lavnoch, Breva) and then northern Zimkovia or Zimkovia or whatever it is called, which stretches in most of the fuschia region
[2024-01-17 02:55 PM] rsulfuratus: so I think the idea is drankor draws a line along the volta and calls everything beyond it the land of the vos, not particularly caring that this creates a line right through "zimka" territory
[2024-01-17 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: when Derik III claims overlordship of Vostok during the wars against Vimfrost, perhaps this is kind of a polite legal fiction in a sense, and it is largely the lowland vos who actually acknowledge his rule in some vague sense. but the people who are actually getting slaughtered by the dragon's armies aren't about to turn down help
[2024-01-17 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: from the point of view of the Vos, the lines would be drawn differently perhaps
[2024-01-17 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: I just don't entirely envision the Zimka (or the Vos) has having borders on a map and clear political units. Like, there is no particular "kingdom" of Zimkovia that anyone could conqueor and the people wouldn't really have the sense of a common nation
[2024-01-17 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah exactly
[2024-01-17 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: vostok is the same way, it is just the part of the world that drankorian mapmakers labeled "the land of the Vos"
[2024-01-17 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-25CAA.png]]
[2024-01-17 03:01 PM] Deciusmus: Basically the pink is the area that is populated by the Zimka people (whereas the red are various Zimka-adajenct kingdoms that might speak the Zimka language but are in fact organized in some type of reconigizable political units)
[2024-01-17 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: people in Sembara would call those the Highland Kingdoms or the Zimka Realms or whatever. Zimkovia is the name for the pink area = the land of the Zimka
[2024-01-17 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: the exact borders with Vostok fuzzy
[2024-01-17 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: where Vostok, like Zimkovia, is a Drankorian fiction, not a real "kingdom"
[2024-01-17 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: I prefer Zimkova, instead of Zimkovia, if you don't care too much. Zimkovia sounds too much like Sokovia from the marvel movies to me
[2024-01-17 03:04 PM] Deciusmus: I am happy with either
[2024-01-17 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: One of the things I don't like is the current history of how the Zimka realms joined and then left Sembara - as per our earlier conversation, I think conquest for the typical human conquest reasons doesn't seem quite right.
[2024-01-17 03:07 PM] Deciusmus: Also the history I wrote a while ago has Derik III never being king of Zimkova, which I think is probably wrong here as well. I think he is in his person High King of Vostok and Zimkova, but his heirs don't maintain that for various reasons, most likely because it was basically always a legal fiction, embodied in Derik III's personal leadership, and the heirs are basically embarassed to claim the title when clearly they are never going to go to those places
[2024-01-17 03:09 PM] Deciusmus: I gotta go back to work for a bit but I might take a stab at rewriting some of the history later. I'll push it in a branch or brainstorming document or something
[2024-01-17 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: do you have names for this river or this lake?
![[../_discord_assets/image-12CF6.png]]
[2024-01-17 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: no
[2024-01-17 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: these are my western cymea names:
    Some rough details for local features:
    
    **Vistalba** (Veess-tahl-bah) - the largest town in this area, a trading port with a decent harbor, once much richer; now has a kind of run-down, lost in the past feeling. harbor dates to Drankorian days, though. once a major port through with Cymea wine, silver, and other goods passed. 
    
    **Castelluccio** (Cah-steh-loo-cho) - one of several small villages inland along the Serrania, scraping by on agriculture
    
    **Vallegra** (Vah-yeh-grah) - another agricultural village
    
    **Redes** (Reh-des) - a small fishing village on the coast, just south of Lunacosta
    
    **Lunacosta** (Loo-nah-koh-stah) - a market town on the coast at the mouth of the Serrania River
    
    ==
    
    `**`Plataca Hills** (*PLAH-tah-kah*) - the hills that begin as low foothills about 40 miles from the western gulf, and rise to a significant barrier to travel
    
    `**`Serranía River** *(Seh-rrah-nee-ah)* - the rushing, rocky river that flows from the Plataca Hills to the Western Gulf. Only the first 10 miles or so are easily navigable.
[2024-01-17 03:29 PM] rsulfuratus: have not put any into main docs yet, on my list
[2024-01-17 03:29 PM] rsulfuratus: Serrania river is the one that has a city at the end
[2024-01-17 03:39 PM] rsulfuratus: I reorganized the taelgarverse css, btw. there are a few bugs i haven't figured out yet but once i sort it out i'll push. there are:
    - leaflet.css for things needed for the maps
    - taelgarverse.css for grids and margins
    - homepage.css for home page banner classes
    - styling.css which has all the color elements
    
    plus
    - home.html which is the template for the home page
    - toc.html which adds backlinks
[2024-01-17 03:42 PM] rsulfuratus: the idea being if you just want to change colors you can just edit styling.css; if you want to change the homepage layout you need to mess with homepage.css and/or the home.html template; and you shouldn't ever need to change talegarverse or leaflet except to add new stuff
[2024-01-17 03:43 PM] rsulfuratus: the layout of the homepage is by far the most annoying and buggiest so i might try to rewrite that entirely. but it should all be isolated now
[2024-01-17 09:53 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed css changes. should be much cleaner now, with nicer button layouts
[2024-01-17 09:54 PM] rsulfuratus: could still fiddle a bit more but probably wont
[2024-01-17 09:54 PM] rsulfuratus: pushing a new website build to make sure it actually works but locally it seems fine.
[2024-01-17 09:54 PM] rsulfuratus: all color settings are in styling.css; note that this assumes you've set color themes for light and dark mode in mkdocs.yml, and that you are using slate as the dark mode color theme.
[2024-01-17 09:55 PM] rsulfuratus: the order of stylesheets in the mkdocs.yml matters - check my taelgarverse repo for how i have it set up
[2024-01-17 09:56 PM] Deciusmus: I should push a new site but haven’t gotten around to it
[2024-01-17 09:56 PM] rsulfuratus: looking at your sembara history now
[2024-01-17 09:57 PM] Deciusmus: More focused on my highland kingdom project
[2024-01-17 09:57 PM] Deciusmus: I ended up with work so I didn’t get as far as I wanted
[2024-01-17 09:57 PM] Deciusmus: Not sure how worthwhile it is to look at
[2024-01-17 09:59 PM] Deciusmus: My main idea is the Zimka are influenced by Pictish/Rus ideas about kingship (see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanistry or https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota_system)
[2024-01-17 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: With the idea that there are many small kings/queens/chiefs often each responsible for just one kestavo shrine.
[2024-01-17 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: Although that’s probably too small scale
[2024-01-17 10:09 PM] Deciusmus: All the bio blocks seem to just be 
    { .bio }
[2024-01-17 10:09 PM] Deciusmus: At least in mobile
[2024-01-17 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: And titles are messed up—
    The Lady Rosalind Essford
[2024-01-17 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that seems like an issue with the exporter script not the css
[2024-01-17 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus: the content of the files is just { .bio }
[2024-01-17 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it is just user error but i'm checking
[2024-01-17 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus: i suspect that the export template ran before obsidian finished indexing or something
[2024-01-17 10:17 PM] rsulfuratus: something definitely seems broken, but not sure what
    ```

[2024-01-17 10:30 PM] rsulfuratus: last time I can confirm the script worked to generate headers was Jan 15th
[2024-01-17 10:35 PM] Deciusmus: I can recreate; I can't figure out what changed though
[2024-01-17 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: The metadata.json file doesn't seem to be loaded correctly
[2024-01-17 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: Adding:
    
    ```
        const metadataFilePath = app.vault.configDir + "/metadata.json";
        let metadataFile = await app.vault.adapter.read(metadataFilePath);        
        customJS.state.coreMeta = JSON.parse(metadataFile)
     
    ```
    to the top of async function regenerateHeader(tp, headerType)  seems to fix it
[2024-01-17 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: pushed a fix
[2024-01-17 10:43 PM] Deciusmus: I added a step to force load customJS in the prepForExport script, because I was running it as a startup script it sometimes it would start before customJS had loaded
[2024-01-17 10:43 PM] Deciusmus: that apparently clears the customJS state, so the loaded metadata was blank, so all the format strings were ""
[2024-01-17 10:43 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a fix
[2024-01-17 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus: fixed
