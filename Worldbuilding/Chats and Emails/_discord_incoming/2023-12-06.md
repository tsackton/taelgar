[2023-12-06 09:47 AM] rsulfuratus: working seriously on calendar eras here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anb-F8574X5BJbA4o1oeSRIuNveaXB--u21Owbd9LTA/edit?usp=sharing
[2023-12-06 09:48 AM] rsulfuratus: just have bits of 10-15 minute chunks throughout the day so will be pretty fragmentary for a while
[2023-12-06 12:18 PM] Deciusmus: For dwarven calendar what about no months?
    
    Each 73 day cycle has 7 named days (one for each thuhr) and 6 11 day weeks spaced Roman style like
    
    Ruler day - 11 days - Traveller day - 11 days - etc 
    
    Where the 1st and last day are both named
[2023-12-06 12:18 PM] Deciusmus: Dates are cycle + counting towards next names day (like Roman kalends/nones/ides)
[2023-12-06 12:19 PM] Deciusmus: Conventionally the middle day of each week is rest/market day
[2023-12-06 12:20 PM] Deciusmus: (And maybe you name the days like:
    X
    1 day after X
    2 day after X
    3 day after X
    4 day after X
    5 day after X
    Between X and Y
    5 day until Y
    …
    Y
[2023-12-06 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus: That is interesting
[2023-12-06 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus: I was kind of going for a slightly Mayan system with cycles-within-cycles-within-cycles
[2023-12-06 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: Right. But the math of cycles in cycles in cycles is rough, as 73 is prime
[2023-12-06 12:27 PM] Deciusmus: So either you have a year is 5 cycles of 73, and the cycles inside 73 are messy, or you have to use something other than 365 for your big cycles
[2023-12-06 12:29 PM] Deciusmus: I think if you want cycles-in-cycles-in-cycles I'd have the intercalendary days outside of the nested cycle
[2023-12-06 12:30 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. have something like
    
    big cycle is 360 days with 10 blocks of 36 each with 6 blocks of 6 or whatever
[2023-12-06 12:30 PM] Deciusmus: but obviously that is a lot harder to code as the inner cycles move around through the year
[2023-12-06 12:30 PM] Deciusmus: although they don't if you add "out of cycle" days
[2023-12-06 12:30 PM] Deciusmus: (which is how the mayans did it)
[2023-12-06 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus: so i had messed around with two intersecting cycles: 10 weeks per month, 5 months per year
    3 extra days per month, 15 extra days per year
[2023-12-06 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus: the extra days count from 1 to 300
[2023-12-06 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus: so every time the extra days start over at 1, you have a 20 year cycle
[2023-12-06 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus: this is strongly inspired by the mayan calendar round
[2023-12-06 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus: with the mayan long count equivalent to the dwarven count of hours
[2023-12-06 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus: but you could also do it without intercalary days by not sticking with a 7 day week
[2023-12-06 12:35 PM] Deciusmus: right what is interesting about the mayan calendar is 2 different ways of counting (reading wikipedia now) that intersect
[2023-12-06 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus: i was trying to go for the same feeling, but simpler to translate
[2023-12-06 12:36 PM] Deciusmus: i.e the 260 day cycle + the 365 day cycle
[2023-12-06 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus: rather than each day having two names that cycle (one per year and one per less-than-year), you have the day/year combo be unambiguous, but the years themselves cycle based on the intercalary day names
[2023-12-06 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus: the strictly mayan style is a bit annoying for dwarves since we want CY years to exist and be equal in length to DR years (both 365 days). whereas my understanding of the mayan calendar is you don't have year numbers
[2023-12-06 12:40 PM] Deciusmus: right the mayan long count is just days in base 20
[2023-12-06 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: what about
    
    Cycle = 73 days = 5 per year
    Each cycle has 36 days / middle day / 36 days
    Each 36 day period is divided into 5 7 day weeks, with another middle day in between.
    
    So the calendar goes
    
    Cycle 1/partA/week1 - Cycle1/partA/week2 - middle day - Cycle1/partB/week3 - Cycle1/partB/week4 - middle middle - etc
    
    Which, I think, is exactly what you proposed
[2023-12-06 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: But I'm not sure I'd think about names for "part a" and "part b"
[2023-12-06 12:48 PM] Deciusmus: I'd create names for the 5 cycles, and names for the days of the week
[2023-12-06 12:49 PM] Deciusmus: then I'd use roman style naming:
    
    14 days before 1st middle day
    13 days...
    1st middle day
    14 days before middle middle
    13 days before middle middle
    middle middle
    14 days before last middle
    13 days before last middle..
    
    etc
[2023-12-06 12:49 PM] Deciusmus: or split like to use days before / days after
[2023-12-06 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: 14 days before 1st middle
    ...
    1st middle
    1 day after 1st middle
    7 days after 1st middle
    7 days before middle middle
    ...
    middle middle
    1 day after middle middle.
    7 days before last middle
    ...
[2023-12-06 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: etc
[2023-12-06 12:51 PM] Deciusmus: actually if you had names for the "1 day before... 7 day before" etc
[2023-12-06 12:51 PM] Deciusmus: and had the intercalendary days repeat on a cycle
[2023-12-06 12:51 PM] Deciusmus: the day name would encode the year which might be interesting
[2023-12-06 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think something like this makes sense just need to work out the details
[2023-12-06 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus: the only problem is a 5 week cycle can't have an even. middle point that is between weeks
[2023-12-06 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus: might be better to do two weeks / day / three weeks / day / two weeks day
[2023-12-06 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: instead of dividing cycle into two parts
[2023-12-06 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking a middle week
[2023-12-06 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: ah that works
[2023-12-06 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: messing around, one sec
[2023-12-06 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus: actually that doesn't quite work. you have 10 weeks plus 3 days in a cycle
[2023-12-06 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus: you could have (2w / 1d / 2w) (1w / 1d / 1w) (2w / 1d / 2w)
[2023-12-06 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: or you could have (2w / 1d ) (3w / 1d / 3w) (1d / 2w)
[2023-12-06 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus: or you could just have (1 d / 5 wk / 1 d / 5wk / 1d)
[2023-12-06 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus: that is the most symmetric
[2023-12-06 12:59 PM] Deciusmus: but I think for 5 weeks to work it needs a name
[2023-12-06 01:00 PM] Deciusmus: 1 d / 5 wk / 1d / 5wk etc is your original proposal
[2023-12-06 01:00 PM] rsulfuratus: a date could be:
    year - cycle - (1-2) - (1-5) - (1-7)
[2023-12-06 01:00 PM] Deciusmus: I was trying to layer in some roman idea around counting towards/away from the middle days
[2023-12-06 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that is better for someone else than dwarves. i like dwarves being kind of mathematical
[2023-12-06 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g.
[2023-12-06 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: 5881.2.1.5.3 = year 5881, 2nd cycle, 1st part, 5th week, 3rd day
[2023-12-06 01:01 PM] Deciusmus: right, if you add a part it works
[2023-12-06 01:01 PM] Deciusmus: I don't think you need 5 parts
[2023-12-06 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, you just could days in each cycle/part combo from 1-35
[2023-12-06 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: rather than counting weeks + day of week
[2023-12-06 01:03 PM] rsulfuratus: although if you have 5 parts nothing ever gets into double digits which is kind of pleasing
[2023-12-06 01:03 PM] rsulfuratus: (except year)
[2023-12-06 01:04 PM] Deciusmus: if you separate out the regularity of the week, I actually think the 36 / 1 could work fine
[2023-12-06 01:04 PM] Deciusmus: you have a sequence of numbered incalendary days from 1 - 300 or whatever
[2023-12-06 01:04 PM] Deciusmus: the date is then
    
    CY 4133 Cycle 1 35 days since day 256
[2023-12-06 01:05 PM] Deciusmus: or 
    CY 4133 Cycle 1 24 days after day 256
[2023-12-06 01:05 PM] Deciusmus: or 
    CY 4133 Cycle 1 Day 256
[2023-12-06 01:07 PM] Deciusmus: but I guess the problem is that  week is, like in human calendar, not really part of the cycle of anything
[2023-12-06 01:07 PM] Deciusmus: might be nicer for dwarves to have the week be part of something
[2023-12-06 01:08 PM] Deciusmus: but you could have a 6 day week and then do
    
    year.cycle.week.day
    
    with one day each cycle that isn't part of a week
[2023-12-06 01:12 PM] Deciusmus: you could also do
    
    2 weeks / 1 day / 2 weeks / 8 day middle middle week /  2 weeks / 1 day / 2 weeks
    
    which keeps the idea of middles
[2023-12-06 01:17 PM] rsulfuratus: I like the date being year.cycle.(part).(week).day.(extra), and I don't think the dwarves should have a concept of units of time that are outside the cycle
[2023-12-06 01:17 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. weeks either don't exist or are regular within the cycle
[2023-12-06 01:17 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, I think that makes sense
[2023-12-06 01:18 PM] rsulfuratus: but not sure exactly the correct arrangement of partts/weeks/extra days to make it work
[2023-12-06 01:18 PM] Deciusmus: if you are wedded to a 7 day week, 6 is a nice number
[2023-12-06 01:18 PM] Deciusmus: you get 6 cycles of 6 days in each cycle
[2023-12-06 01:19 PM] Deciusmus: sorry, 12 cycles of 6 days
[2023-12-06 01:19 PM] Deciusmus: or 6 x 6
[2023-12-06 01:19 PM] Deciusmus: but your numbering could be
    
    year.cycle(5/73days).week(12/6 days).day
[2023-12-06 01:19 PM] Deciusmus: with 1 special day per cycle / 5 per year
[2023-12-06 01:20 PM] rsulfuratus: that might work, although i like have a 7 in there somewhere as it seems natural to have something in the cycle associated with gods
[2023-12-06 01:20 PM] rsulfuratus: the outer cycle has to be 5 to get 5*73
[2023-12-06 01:21 PM] rsulfuratus: so the 7 probably needs to be in the 73
[2023-12-06 01:21 PM] rsulfuratus: unless the gods are part of the extra day rotation
[2023-12-06 01:21 PM] Deciusmus: you can get 7 extra days per month if you have 11 weeks of 6 days
[2023-12-06 01:22 PM] Deciusmus: "month = 73 day cycle"
[2023-12-06 01:22 PM] Deciusmus: (or 6 weeks of 11 days)
[2023-12-06 01:23 PM] Deciusmus: you could have
    
    year.cycle.week(11/6 days each).day(1 of 6)
    or
    year.cycle.thuhr N
    
    where each god repeats once per cycle, and the N increments once per cycle
[2023-12-06 01:23 PM] Deciusmus: so each year you have 5 traveller days, 5 ruler days, etc
[2023-12-06 01:24 PM] Deciusmus: you each have some akwardness where the days get inserted, or they need to be 6 weeks of 11 not 11 weeks of 6
[2023-12-06 01:26 PM] rsulfuratus: have meetings until 4 but will think on this a bit. definitely think the right option is somewhere in here
[2023-12-06 01:26 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, i need to go do some work as well
[2023-12-06 01:28 PM] Deciusmus: you could have
    
    Thurhday - 2 weeks - Thuhr day - 2 weeks - Thurh day - 2 weeks - Thurday - 2 weeks - Thurh day - 2 week  - Thurday - 1 week - Thurday
[2023-12-06 01:29 PM] Deciusmus: it gives you one week per cycle (5 per year) which is close to 2 thuhr days
[2023-12-06 01:29 PM] Deciusmus: it gives lots of cycles of 5, which could be interesting, i.e. 5 cycles per year, 5 days to each thuhr per year, 5 "special weeks" per year, etc
[2023-12-06 03:54 PM] rsulfuratus: Here are the various prime factorizations for a 73 day cycle with X extra days:
    1 extra day gives 72, which divides to 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3
    2 extra days gives 71 (prime not useful)
    3 extra days gives 70, which divides to 2 x 5 x 7
    4 extra days gives 69, which divides to 3 x 23
    5 extra days gives 68, which divides to 2 x 2 x 17
    6 extra days gives 67 (prime not useful)
    7 extra days gives 66, which divides to 2 x 3 x 11
    8 extra days gives 65, which divides to 5 x 13
    9 extra days gives 64, which divides 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2
    10 extra days gives 63, which is 3 x 3 x 7
[2023-12-06 03:55 PM] rsulfuratus: The only options I've found that fit a 73-day cycle and also have some kind of 7 somewhere are:
    Six 11 day weeks per cycle with seven extra days: d w d w d w d w d w d w d
    Ten 7 day weeks with three extra days: d (w w w w w ) d ( w w w w w ) d
    Three 21 day months of three 7 day weeks each, with 10 extra days: d ( w d w d w ) d ( w d w d w ) d ( w d w d w ) d
[2023-12-06 03:58 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I did the same think basically, just slightly more informally
[2023-12-06 03:59 PM] Deciusmus: 7 10 day weeks or 11 6 day weeks also work if you are willing to mess about with the symmetry
[2023-12-06 04:00 PM] rsulfuratus: I like either six 11 day weeks with the 7 "thuhr days" inserted between each week, or ten 7 day weeks (each day named after a thuhr/god)
[2023-12-06 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: I personally like the 7 thuhr days
[2023-12-06 04:01 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I do to
[2023-12-06 04:01 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`too
[2023-12-06 04:01 PM] rsulfuratus: the only slight hesitation is it is almost too perfect
[2023-12-06 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: Well, you could have 6 day weeks, gives you the odd pattern
[2023-12-06 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i like the symmetry in a cycle, I just want an "outer cycle" as well
[2023-12-06 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: oh, you mean the 5x5
[2023-12-06 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-12-06 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: but you could do 7x7 with the thuhr days
[2023-12-06 04:03 PM] Deciusmus: well, you intersincally have 5 of them per year, right?
[2023-12-06 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: but you mean make the repeating cycle every 35 days
[2023-12-06 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. Ruler 35 ->` Ruler 1
[2023-12-06 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: so you have a 7 year cycle of thuhr days layered on top of the year
[2023-12-06 04:04 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2023-12-06 04:05 PM] rsulfuratus: well, something like that
[2023-12-06 04:06 PM] rsulfuratus: can tune the repeat unit of the outer cycle to get something longer or shorter
[2023-12-06 04:06 PM] Deciusmus: so would dates be: year.cycle.day? Or year.cycle.week.day
[2023-12-06 04:06 PM] rsulfuratus: I'd do the latter
[2023-12-06 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: with day 0 being the intercalary day
[2023-12-06 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: athought that doesn't quite work because there is one more intercalary day than weeks
[2023-12-06 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: so either year.(name of cycle).(number of week).(number of day) or year.(name of cycle).ruler 35
[2023-12-06 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: right yeah that works
[2023-12-06 04:08 PM] rsulfuratus: can tweak the exact representation but something like that
[2023-12-06 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: Which basically means for names just need to make up the names of the 5 cycles
[2023-12-06 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: might just call them dwarven word for first, second, third
[2023-12-06 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: etc
[2023-12-06 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: It seems like 
    
    year 5122, 2nd month, 3rd week, 11th day is a little short on names?
[2023-12-06 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: but maybe its ok
[2023-12-06 04:10 PM] rsulfuratus: I mean like november, december except in fake dwarvish
[2023-12-06 04:10 PM] rsulfuratus: so they'd have names, the names just mean first month, second month, etc when translated
[2023-12-06 04:10 PM] Deciusmus: right, I'm projecting into dwarvish
[2023-12-06 04:11 PM] Deciusmus: I guess you could have weekday names on top of the cycle
[2023-12-06 04:11 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. what does a dwarf say to his friend, let's meet next Thirdday?
[2023-12-06 04:11 PM] Deciusmus: that works for me, but then I wonder if you want names for months
[2023-12-06 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: you probably need names of the week because next eleventhday sounds weird
[2023-12-06 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: or maybe it is just "1 after ruler, 2 after ruler" etc
[2023-12-06 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. roman style
[2023-12-06 04:12 PM] Deciusmus: right, actually that works
[2023-12-06 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe this:
    Ruler
    1 after ruler
    2 after ruler
    3 after ruler
    4 after ruler
    5 after ruler
    Ruler midweek
    5 before priest
    4 before priest
    3 before priest
    2 before priest
    1 before priest
    Priest
[2023-12-06 04:18 PM] rsulfuratus: the only slighty asymettric bit is that there are two thuhr days in a row between one cycle and the next, so there is one thuhr, which ever is last, that never gets the "after" days
[2023-12-06 04:18 PM] Deciusmus: the other point I guess is that the romans used these instead of day #, not instead of names for days of the week
[2023-12-06 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: ie. Friday the 6th kalends
[2023-12-06 04:19 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-12-06 04:20 PM] rsulfuratus: but probably no need to actually make up dwarven weekday names
[2023-12-06 04:22 PM] rsulfuratus: on the other hand I could see no real need for days of the week names in dwarven. maybe within each cycle you'd just say 2.6 or 3.4
[2023-12-06 04:23 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe the middle day of the week has a special name and conventionally the thuhr days and the middle days are rest days
[2023-12-06 04:24 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, for the purposes of calendars and dates, I think it doesn't matter. 
    
    A CY date is
    
    Year.(Month, named, maybe "Firstember style").number.number OR
    Year.(Month, named, maybe "Firstember style").thuhr number
[2023-12-06 04:24 PM] rsulfuratus: if you wanted to invent dwarven day names they could be dervied from something like 5 before, 4 before, on, 1 after, 2 after
[2023-12-06 04:24 PM] Deciusmus: where the dots are not intended to be necessarly the separator
[2023-12-06 04:25 PM] rsulfuratus: right although the number after the thuhr is not needed to uniquely specify a day w/i a year
[2023-12-06 04:25 PM] rsulfuratus: it just specifies a year within a 7 year cycle
[2023-12-06 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-12-06 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: I guess whether the style is
    
    year.named month.thuhr
    year.named month.thuhr number
    or just
    year.thuhr number
    
    is up for grabs. They all uniquely specify a date
[2023-12-06 04:27 PM] rsulfuratus: still going to think on this a bit, but I think this is the basic framework. not 100% sure about the thuhr number yet. feels like with thuhr days you kind of already have a nice concept that doesn't need the extra cycle tacked on
[2023-12-06 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: sure, year.named month.thuhr could be were it lands
[2023-12-06 04:30 PM] Deciusmus: Zekaf

[2023-12-06 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: are you messing around with code at all?
[2023-12-06 08:55 PM] rsulfuratus: no
[2023-12-06 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: i was making a stab at error bars for dates
[2023-12-06 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: But was piggybacking on your dwarf stuff
[2023-12-06 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not likely to do any coding work until after my game on Sunday, so go wild
[2023-12-06 09:00 PM] Deciusmus: DR 1/1/1 is supposed to be March 16, 4133 right? Which would be 75th day?
[2023-12-06 09:00 PM] rsulfuratus: March 17th
[2023-12-06 09:00 PM] rsulfuratus: well, actually, no
[2023-12-06 09:00 PM] Deciusmus: so the 76th day of 4133?
[2023-12-06 09:00 PM] rsulfuratus: that's backwards
[2023-12-06 09:01 PM] rsulfuratus: 1/1/4133 is march 17, dR 1
[2023-12-06 09:01 PM] Deciusmus: right so 1/1 DR is a late date in 4132
[2023-12-06 09:01 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-12-06 09:02 PM] rsulfuratus: the code i pushed last night gets the conversion correct from years since creation
[2023-12-06 09:03 PM] rsulfuratus: 3-17-1749 should be 1-1-5882
[2023-12-06 09:03 PM] rsulfuratus: 3-17-1748 should be 1-1-5881
[2023-12-06 09:04 PM] rsulfuratus: Etc
[2023-12-06 09:06 PM] Deciusmus: but it seems to be reporting CY 4133-08-35.2 for DR 1 / 1/ 1
[2023-12-06 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: Hmm
[2023-12-06 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: Maybe I messed something up
[2023-12-06 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: I was testing with jsfiddle and it was correct
[2023-12-06 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: What does report for DR 1748-3-17
[2023-12-06 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: 5881.1.1
[2023-12-06 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: it gets that right
[2023-12-06 09:08 PM] rsulfuratus: So yes I think I got the year drankor was founded wrong then
[2023-12-06 09:08 PM] Deciusmus: are you sure the year isn't just off by 1
[2023-12-06 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: Well the year for 1748 is correct
[2023-12-06 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: Don’t know how it could get one year wrong and another right
[2023-12-06 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: because year 1 doesn't count
[2023-12-06 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: there is no year zero
[2023-12-06 09:10 PM] rsulfuratus: Ah hmm maybe
[2023-12-06 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: so the dates of 4133 and 5881 can't both be correct
[2023-12-06 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: there is 1 too many years in between them
[2023-12-06 09:11 PM] Deciusmus: because the years are counted inclusive of 1, i.e. year 2 is actually only 1 year old, so to speak
[2023-12-06 09:11 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, there are 1748 years between 4133 and 5881 but only 1747 years between 1 and 1748
[2023-12-06 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: easiest to just say Drankor was founded in late 4133 instead of late 4132
[2023-12-06 09:16 PM] rsulfuratus: That is what I meant
[2023-12-06 09:16 PM] rsulfuratus: When I said I got the date wrong
[2023-12-06 09:17 PM] Deciusmus: right
