# Discord DM – 2023-11-30

[2023-11-30 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus: trying to organize some details of human migrations / cultures a bit more clearly to help figure out some details about some things that might come up towards the end of the session tonight. going to push a page to brainstorming before 1:30, and then in meetings until 4pm. if you have a chance to look and see anything you think is wrong, let me know
[2023-11-30 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus: got sucked into a meeting so nevermind
[2023-11-30 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus: not getting to this before the session
[2023-11-30 01:57 PM] Deciusmus: Btw I was thinking about export a bit some more. It would be pretty easy to write a template command that materialized all of the headers at a specific date. 
    
    The simplest export flow could be to ignore the python duplicate code entirely and just do…
    
    git branch export
    Open obsidian
    Run command that updates all headers using a fixed date
    Close obsidian
    Run export 
    git checkout main; git branch -d export
[2023-11-30 03:42 PM] rsulfuratus: that is a good idea
[2023-11-30 03:43 PM] rsulfuratus: still could use python code for cleaning markdown but would not have to reimplement dataview commands
[2023-11-30 03:46 PM] rsulfuratus: we've been working on a new website for my lab and so i'm messing around a little bit with python code to write html from markdown templates - I suspect ultimately the best use of python coding time is to move away from a dependence on obdianhtml, which is no longer maintained
[2023-11-30 06:45 PM] Deciusmus: I managed to do a bit of a PoC in between other things and it defintely works fine
