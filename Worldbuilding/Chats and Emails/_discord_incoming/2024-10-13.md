# Discord DM – 2024-10-13

[2024-10-13 05:14 PM] rsulfuratus: two things:
    (a) when you get a chance, can you unclaim Tilly from Taelgar Revisited so I can claim her back?
    (b) Spent some time cleaning up a bunch of bad data this afternoon in between other things, so tons of changes in Github but mostly e.g. updating header version and other minor edits like that. FYI.
