# Discord DM – 2024-10-31

[2024-10-31 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus: I'm not super busy today and am getting back to some of the dm status stuff and obsidian cleanup, which has taken a back seat to session prep in my taelgar time for a while. is it useful to set dm_notes and dm_owner on pages outside people/places/things/groups? e.g., species, cosomology, religion, etc. most of these would be dm_notes: none, dm_owner: none, but there might be isolated exceptions and I have no particular opinion on whether it is better to have default info set for all pages or just assume blank = none/none
[2024-10-31 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus: setting it makes it easier to find pages that should have it but don't, i guess
[2024-10-31 11:19 AM] Deciusmus: I think there are no so many pages outside people/places and I do think it is useful to be able to find pages without it set
[2024-10-31 11:19 AM] Deciusmus: It is probably a reasonable assumption that cosmology/religion/etc are none/none if unset (vs people/places/things where it is trickier to assume) but if I was in a completest/cleanup mode I'd set the none/nones on the other pages
[2024-10-31 11:20 AM] Deciusmus: there are exceptions, i.e. Duskmire
[2024-10-31 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus: right, we would presumably not bother for setting on pages in campaigns, but i can see for cosomology, events, history, etc it might be useful
[2024-10-31 11:20 AM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-10-31 11:21 AM] Deciusmus: campaigns is silly, as everything in the campaign folder is implicitly dm_notes: (owner of campaign)
[2024-10-31 11:21 AM] Deciusmus: or whatever
[2024-10-31 11:21 AM] Deciusmus: and campaigns is excluded from a lot of MOC stuff
[2024-10-31 11:21 AM] Deciusmus: but i.e. cosmology I think its valuable
[2024-10-31 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus: i think i did set a few in cosomology when doing a bit of cleanup / reorg there
[2024-10-31 11:22 AM] Deciusmus: yeah, you did
[2024-10-31 11:22 AM] Deciusmus: i.e. dm_owner on plane of fire but not plane of earth, which is (theoritcally) valueable info to me (although my campaign is no where close to the outer planes at the moment, obviously)
[2024-10-31 11:22 AM] Deciusmus: but i.e. setting dm tags on all the feywild realms is definitely worthwhile
