# Discord DM – 2025-03-03

[2025-03-03 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus: i've been pretty busy at work the past few weeks and then in my spare time have mostly been doing session prep and working on roll20 api scripts to automate some annoying aspects of combat, so haven't had much time to do any taelgarverse updates. but today is fairly light, actually, so i'm likely going to try to push a few updates, mostly probably focusing on region pages and check/tim stuff. fyi in case you are using your recovery as an excuse to not work much today
