# Discord DM – 2023-12-22

[2023-12-22 10:38 AM] Deciusmus: I'm trying to come up with some fey legends about Ethlynn and Lord Umbraeth for my PCs to discover next session (Jan 7th)... 
    
    I want a mix of truth, maybe true, and somewhat definitely not true...
[2023-12-22 10:38 AM] Deciusmus: I assume you don't have any strong feelings about why Umbraeth left Twilight's Grace or Ethlyn's personality?
[2023-12-22 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: Here are some ideas I have so far...
    
    A story or legend about a lover's quarell between them - definitely false
    Something about a time when Umbraeth was in Twilght's Grace during a competition of some sort, that he was in charge of, but rigged, which upset Ethyln
    A story or legend about Duskmire growing bigger "recently"
