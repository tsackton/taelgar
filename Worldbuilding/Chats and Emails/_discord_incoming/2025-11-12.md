# Discord DM – 2025-11-12

[2025-11-12 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: Any thoughts on the correct tag / location for a page that is about a creature rather than a species?
[2025-11-12 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. Duskhounds?
[2025-11-12 05:53 PM] rsulfuratus: creatures/fey
[2025-11-12 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: right, but is the page tag `[species]` or something else
[2025-11-12 05:53 PM] rsulfuratus: but tagging is unclear. i guess we need a creature tag?
[2025-11-12 05:54 PM] rsulfuratus: either have creature and species as two top level tags, or fold species into creature and use typeOf: species (or something)?
[2025-11-12 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: what is the difference?
[2025-11-12 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, I know what the difference is in world/etc, but what's the point of 2 tags?
[2025-11-12 05:54 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not sure there is any
[2025-11-12 05:55 PM] rsulfuratus: at least i can't think of any right now
[2025-11-12 05:55 PM] Deciusmus: the easiest is to just (mis)use species for now
[2025-11-12 05:55 PM] Deciusmus: until someone feels like renaming to creature and/or sees a reason for multiple tags
[2025-11-12 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: it is easy to just rename the tag in the tag browser - i'd probably just switch everything to creature
[2025-11-12 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: although i guess there is a bunch of code to update
[2025-11-12 05:56 PM] Deciusmus: there are just a bunch of queries like "missing tags" and maybe things in javascript that might care
[2025-11-12 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: good use for codex/github
[2025-11-12 05:57 PM] rsulfuratus: but yeah fine to misuse species until someone feels like doing the cleanup
