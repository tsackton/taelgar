[2023-12-26 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus: thinking about your feywild stuff
[2023-12-26 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus: amberglow fell around 1000 DR
[2023-12-26 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus: although the exact timing could be fairly uncertain as it may have persisted in some form for some time after cloudspinner's disappearance
[2023-12-26 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus: more in a bit
[2023-12-26 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/feywild-93FD6.png]]
[2023-12-26 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus: this is kind of rough but I guess I'm not fully understanding the geography you are imagining? especially if the Cleanseau portal is new - that is too far north to be former Amberglow territory IMO
[2023-12-26 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus: Amberglow probably never really extended north of Insingue
[2023-12-26 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus: Shimmersong could easily extend a bit east, across the Aurbez plateu, and Duskmire could be in the Darkwood area
[2023-12-26 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus: fey geography doesn't need to perfectly match the material plane especially as a far as distances are concerned
[2023-12-26 01:12 PM] Deciusmus: Here's the geography I was imagining....
    
    Original:
    
    Duskmire stretches from the border of Twilights Grace west as far as the Sembaran Wall, south as far as the northern Mostreve Hills, and north as far as the Wistel
[2023-12-26 01:15 PM] Deciusmus: Between the fall of Amberglow and the disruptions of the Ulrich Pass, it has now grown, and roughly runs from the Andonne/Darkwood in the south and east, to the Wistel in the North, and as far west as Dreamhaven
[2023-12-26 01:16 PM] Deciusmus: Although I suspect Lord Umbraeth is somewhat welcoming to refugees and fugitives and sketchy types exiles from other places for bad behavior or whatever, and that the edges - and especially the western and southern edges - of his realm are somewhat of a loose confederation of allies
[2023-12-26 01:17 PM] Deciusmus: In Drankorian days ,the only portal to Duskmire that the Drankorians knew about was in the Sentinels west of the Mostreve Hills. The Cleenseau portal definitely was never Amberglow, it is a new portal to Duskmire
[2023-12-26 01:18 PM] Deciusmus: The key thing is that there is something to the north of Duskmire that checks Lord Umbraeth's ambitions or expansion
[2023-12-26 01:19 PM] Deciusmus: And actually his original realm could have been entirely south of the Enst. Maybe there was a fey kingdom that was nestled into the mountains east of Dreamhaven that was distrupted by Cha'mutte's death
[2023-12-26 01:53 PM] Deciusmus: Let me take a step back. Ultimately for my game I want Duskmire to:
    (a) have expanded recently (ideally to include Cleenseau recently, although certainly since the Great War, and "recent" could be 100s of years ago)
    (b) bordered by something odd and interesting in the west, Twilight's Grace in the east, something to the north that prevents expansion, and the shifting and chaotic borders of Amberglow to the south
[2023-12-26 01:55 PM] Deciusmus: i'm not sure how much you want to leave undeveloped in the Semaran feywild, but..
[2023-12-26 01:58 PM] Deciusmus: Here is one idea...
    
    Thousands of years ago, when Umbraeth was exiled from Twilight's Grace, he established/took over/something a small kingdom, labeled D on this map:
![[../_discord_assets/image-7BD23.png]]
[2023-12-26 01:58 PM] Deciusmus: Perhaps it was even a bit smaller, not covering the Darkwood
[2023-12-26 02:01 PM] Deciusmus: On the borders were two other fey realms (labeled 1 and 3) which today don't exist.
    
    Realm 3 was an ally of Ethlenn's in some fashion, and Umbraeth tricking/killing/imprisoning/exiling/something him/her/them was the thing that lead to truly bad blood between them. 
    
    So at some point, Duskmire expanded northward to cover the lands between the Andonne and Wistel, basically.
[2023-12-26 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: Then, when Cha'mutte died, some echo/something disrupted Realm 1. No idea what exactly (although actually, what if Cha'mutte's death somehow opened a connect to the Far Realms near Ulrich, and there is some kind of blight spreading - or perhaps not really spreading but just present - in all of the echo realms near Ulrich)
[2023-12-26 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: So now it looks like this:
[2023-12-26 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-3EE7E.png]]
[2023-12-26 02:07 PM] Deciusmus: Realm 4 on the first map has expanded west a bit and is some sort of powerful fey who Umbraeth doesn't dare mess with
[2023-12-26 02:07 PM] Deciusmus: (now labeled 2, and not intentionally different from 1st map, just sloppy drawing, other than expanded to the west)
[2023-12-26 02:08 PM] Deciusmus: Duskmire (now in red) has grown substanitially
[2023-12-26 02:08 PM] Deciusmus: and realm 1 (now in black) is empty/strange/far-realm infested/shrunk/something
[2023-12-26 02:09 PM] Deciusmus: Darkwood is underdetermined, I realize I drew it a bit inconsistently, it could be part of Umbraeth's domain or it could be separate
[2023-12-26 02:12 PM] rsulfuratus: I think this basically works. I haven't yet completely worked out what actually happened when Cha'mutte died but this will likely be connected somehow to future Isingue adventure so I'd leave that uncertain and mysterious for now
[2023-12-26 02:12 PM] rsulfuratus: but some kind of desolate area that even Umbreath fears on the west is good
[2023-12-26 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: I was just thinking it could connect to the future part of my game that ends up dealing with far realm mindflayer stuff. But it doesn't have to
[2023-12-26 02:13 PM] rsulfuratus: Shimmersong is canonically kind of a fortress, with the winter knights who protect the kingdom when the Lightbringer is sleeping so it makes sense for it to have dangers on three sides
[2023-12-26 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: and that is a while away - the insinguer stuff might happen first actually
[2023-12-26 02:13 PM] rsulfuratus: we are likely to finish isingue before you get to mindflayers
[2023-12-26 02:16 PM] rsulfuratus: unless the exact borders are important for your plot i'd also leave the darkwood and the upper istaros a bit undeveloped
[2023-12-26 02:16 PM] Deciusmus: exact borders don't matter -
[2023-12-26 02:18 PM] rsulfuratus: look at the shimmersong note
[2023-12-26 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that the shimmersong / duskmire border would actually potentially be more interesting than the amberglow connection
[2023-12-26 02:19 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, just reading it
[2023-12-26 02:20 PM] Deciusmus: Although I think Umbraeth ultimately is motivated by a sense of betrayal and hatred from Ethlenn. So at some level he doesn't care about the west so much as he does the east. But that border does sound like an interesting place
[2023-12-26 02:22 PM] rsulfuratus: I think I would push shimmersong's eastern border a little east and north, so the Aurbez plateau is fully within Shimmersong, and Duskmire is really originally centered east of Masance and north of Andonne
[2023-12-26 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: originally this was maybe, if not exactly empty land, not a strong realm, or perhaps was even gifted to Umbreath by Ethlynn, if the original split is more of an exile than a violent betrayal
[2023-12-26 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: Ethlynn feels to me a like a archfey with significant power
[2023-12-26 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2023-12-26 02:24 PM] Deciusmus: I agree withthat
[2023-12-26 02:24 PM] rsulfuratus: so likely the bordering realms would be allies / vassals
[2023-12-26 02:24 PM] rsulfuratus: her realm also borders Orenlas - or perhaps extends through Orenlas
[2023-12-26 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: but also I think Ethylnn is more place-focused than many archfey
[2023-12-26 02:25 PM] Deciusmus: I actually like that a lot. He is originally exiled to his own realm, gifted by Ethlynn.
[2023-12-26 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: That works on a bunch of levels - the gift itself is a form of punishment, somewhat daring him to recreate her court for himself, which he can't do, so his inability to make even his own realm the kind of place he would want to live ends up its own kind of torment
[2023-12-26 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: Ethlenn could even the the original source of a deal, insisting that no one from her realm could go to his - which he thinks is a punishment for *her* but actually works out as a punishment to him beceause ultimately he loved the Twighlight Court, or whatever, which might be somewhat famous for its elegance and refinement, and upscale amusements
[2023-12-26 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: and he can't attract any talent because any fey that gives him alliegence can't go to the Twilight Court (which only happens every X years)
[2023-12-26 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the other question is what exactly Twlight's Grace is. I think that it is intentionally a small realm for ~reasons~
[2023-12-26 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: but Ethlenn really is probably the "leader" in some vague fey sense of the whole western gulf
[2023-12-26 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: i.e., I don't think "realm 4" is more powerful than Ethlenn, that doesn't feel quite right
[2023-12-26 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: No, definitley not
[2023-12-26 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: I didn't mean to imply that
[2023-12-26 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: Just powerful enough that Umbraeth doesn't dare start something
[2023-12-26 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: He definitley can't start anything with Ethlenn
[2023-12-26 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. he has no hope of conqueoring Twilight's Grace or really even harming it; he lives for small acts of venegance and revenge
[2023-12-26 02:32 PM] Deciusmus: For example, I imagine him trying to trick warlocks of Ethlenn to enter his realm, at which point they have violated the terms of the deal between him and Ethlenn by trepassing and lose her protection
[2023-12-26 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: Or he tries to trick someone into believing that the terms of his deal with Ethlenn extend to the Materiel Plane. Other things like that. He has no particular hope of mounting any kind of attack on her --- but she is also bound by their agreement and can't enter his realm
[2023-12-26 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: Why does Ethlenn care about Tyrwingha? It seems like depending on the reason it would influence what she would be willing to give up to punish Umbreath
[2023-12-26 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. this is all great but also is very much a "both Ethlenn and Umbreath see mortal servants as pawns" vibe
[2023-12-26 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: which maybe is the right vibe
[2023-12-26 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm just not sure
[2023-12-26 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: So, the vibe I've been running for with Ethlenn is "beautiful wise faraway" - sort of Galadriel-equese
[2023-12-26 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: But definitely somewhat cavalier with mortals, in that she launched a bunch of PCs on various paths to try to ensure that they ended up in Cleenseau to stop an assassination attempt on Elaine
[2023-12-26 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: (and of course the PCs don't know this)
[2023-12-26 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: right, but that feels more like a divine protector
[2023-12-26 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: But also she `*`cares a lot* about the Tyrwinghan royal family
[2023-12-26 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: for reasons I'm not totally clear on
[2023-12-26 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: so to me that implies a different relationship with Umbreath. e.g., what if Umbreath tricks a prince of Tyrwingha into Duskmire
[2023-12-26 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: on the other hand, fine if fey feel weird and illogical
[2023-12-26 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: meaning, what would she do if that happened?
[2023-12-26 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: does she agree to deal that punishes mortals who enter duskmire?
[2023-12-26 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: would she even propose that deal if she sees the mortals of tyrwingha as under her protection?
[2023-12-26 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: Hrm
[2023-12-26 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: A couple of possiblities come to mind...
[2023-12-26 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: (a) it could have been a mistake at some level, a failure of foresight and changing human conditions. Perhaps when she made the deal she didn't anticipate the relationship between Sembara and Tyrwingha (unclear if Umbraeth was exiled pre or post Drankorian deal)
    
    (b) it could have been somewhat involuntary - there is this material of the "realm 3" that Umbraeth conqueored/defeated/something else. Perhaps Ethlenn saw a deal like this as the best of a bad set of options
[2023-12-26 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: (c) it could not apply to mortals -
[2023-12-26 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: (c) might actually work the best. The deal doesn't apply to mortals at all, Umbraeth just likes to try to trick them
[2023-12-26 02:50 PM] rsulfuratus: i kind of feel like Ethlenn's vibe is that she has protected Tyrwingha forever, basically
[2023-12-26 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: Yes
[2023-12-26 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: so rather than fight with Umbreath starting as a fey conflict, what if it starts as Umbreath playing small tricks on mortals that she doesn't approve of?
[2023-12-26 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: she kicks him out so he can't access Tyrwingha
[2023-12-26 02:53 PM] Deciusmus: I like that
[2023-12-26 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe in the beginning she's not even really mad at him, exactly, just disappointed / annoyed
[2023-12-26 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: and this could also be the source of a lot of weird fey rumors in tyrinwingha
[2023-12-26 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: so, a long time ago you have Twilight's Grace, which is kind of the center of power of the western gulf, and Ethlenn with this idiosyncratic wish to protect tyrwingha. but also a lot of power and seeing the other neighboring realms as basically vassals
[2023-12-26 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: one of her rules is that you cannot mess with the mortals of tyrwingha
[2023-12-26 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: Umbreath is high up in her court, maybe an important vassal, obviosly somewhat powerful
[2023-12-26 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: but also chaotic in nature and can't resist the temptation to trick people sometimes
[2023-12-26 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: Ethlenn finds out, and punishes him with exile
[2023-12-26 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: perhaps there is a deal of sorts, she will let him live but no fey can go to his court if they wish to join the Twilight Court, etc, as you discussed
[2023-12-26 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that works
[2023-12-26 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: she is bound by the promise so as he has gotten more cruel and violent over the years she can't just invade his realm
[2023-12-26 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: his realm probably starts quite small then, nestled between the Aurbez / Shimmersong, the Andonnne, the Darkwood, and the Enst
[2023-12-26 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-12-26 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: although it could also work for it to have originally just been the darkwood
[2023-12-26 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: huh, thats a good idea
[2023-12-26 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: which perhap was "the darkwood" even as far back as the Drankorian empire
[2023-12-26 03:00 PM] rsulfuratus: I like that a lot actually
[2023-12-26 03:01 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, so he starts as Duskmire is just the darkwood
[2023-12-26 03:01 PM] rsulfuratus: right, and then over time he is the one who whever there is an opportunity, grabs territory
[2023-12-26 03:02 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the exact details don't matter much
[2023-12-26 03:02 PM] rsulfuratus: their is no reason to believe fey realms are particularly static
[2023-12-26 03:02 PM] rsulfuratus: although archfey rarely die they likely wax and wane in power
[2023-12-26 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: I think Ethlenn has been a constant, of course, and Cloudspinner was for a while
[2023-12-26 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: Ethlenn can't go after him directly because she agreed to a deal not to harm him or something
[2023-12-26 03:04 PM] Deciusmus: Sure, so his realm grows a bit here and there
[2023-12-26 03:04 PM] Deciusmus: I guess there doesn't even need to be a realm that falls
[2023-12-26 03:04 PM] Deciusmus: It could work to just have the relationship between them get worse and worse as he always takes the opportunity to expand
[2023-12-26 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: And the really only "major" thing that happens is the fey realm in the southern sentinels is disrupted at the end of the Great War, to be replaced with some empty terrority, which he takes and some "scary thing to the west"
[2023-12-26 03:06 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I'd probably leave it a bit undetermined
[2023-12-26 03:07 PM] rsulfuratus: Amberglow in part is modeled after the Sandman's realm in the netflix series after he is imprisoned for a long time
[2023-12-26 03:07 PM] rsulfuratus: Cloudspinner is/was powerful enough that Amberglow is not conquered, it is empty / decaying
[2023-12-26 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: but of course one can assume there were many smaller realms stretching between Amberglow and Twilight's Grace
[2023-12-26 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: and with the fall of Amberglow, these are vunerable
[2023-12-26 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: then, I do think there were serious disruptions around the time of the Great War
[2023-12-26 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: Even Umbreath may not understand exactly what happened
[2023-12-26 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: But, the west is now scary/dangerous
[2023-12-26 03:09 PM] rsulfuratus: And possibly Insigue mumble mumble something Beryl Rangers magic water mumble
[2023-12-26 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: Shimmersong is a hard stop on westward expansion by Umbreath but he might not really care, and might even ally with Lightdancer sometimes to defeat incursions from "scary west thing"
[2023-12-26 03:11 PM] rsulfuratus: And, perhaps, Ethlenn never really cared much about the southwest - this was always somehow in the Cloudspinner's orbit - so she doesn't do anything after the fall of Amberglow
[2023-12-26 03:12 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-C63EB.png]]
[2023-12-26 03:12 PM] rsulfuratus: But as Umbreath becomes more and more a thorn in her side she does make sure that ~fey realm in Sembara~ is not vulnerable
[2023-12-26 03:12 PM] Deciusmus: So the above has Shimmersong expanded a bit and then #1 is the original duskmire
[2023-12-26 03:13 PM] Deciusmus: 1+2 is the minimum size of Duskmire now for game reasons. Open quesiton is whether it includes 3 (and it could go a little farther west, basically, until it stopped by the "scary thing")
[2023-12-26 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: Then north of Duskmire I think there are at probably 2 different realms, but the details don't matter too much. I was thinking about a Highlands-kingdom-northern realm full of human sized beasts, where all the animals talk
[2023-12-26 03:15 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think this makes sense
[2023-12-26 03:15 PM] rsulfuratus: the exact southern/western borders of Duskmire don't matter so much
[2023-12-26 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: But then there is probably also some other realm or realms  in the western gulf/sembara/tollen area that is twilight's grace ally/part of Ethlenns domain
[2023-12-26 03:16 PM] rsulfuratus: probably there is some buffer area around #3  but whether a full-fledged realm or just a kind of demilitarized zone could be unclear
[2023-12-26 03:17 PM] rsulfuratus: my feeling is expanding west and south would be easy for Duskmire since Ethlenn perhaps doesn't acre
[2023-12-26 03:17 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`care
[2023-12-26 03:17 PM] rsulfuratus: and e.g. what is now March of Andonne might have been a vassal of Amberglow or something
[2023-12-26 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2023-12-26 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: then Duskmire cannot expand further west because of the hard border with Shimmersong, but north open
[2023-12-26 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: Right, and the north is especially opened after the "whatever happened" during the fall of Cha'mutte
[2023-12-26 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: exactly
[2023-12-26 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: so that is presumably more recent
[2023-12-26 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: And so since the Great War Duskmire could have grown by 50% or something, pushing north
[2023-12-26 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: Which works perfectly, it makes Duskmire's overlap with Cleenseau recent, which is what I was after
[2023-12-26 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: What do you think of Twilight's Gate as the name for a militarized buffer realm
[2023-12-26 03:25 PM] rsulfuratus: sound a little too similar to Twilight's Grace for my taste
[2023-12-26 03:25 PM] rsulfuratus: but don't have strong feelings
[2023-12-26 03:25 PM] Deciusmus: Well, I was feeling like maybe a bit too similar
[2023-12-26 03:26 PM] rsulfuratus: could just be the Sunset Gate
[2023-12-26 03:26 PM] rsulfuratus: it is the line where the sun actually sets
[2023-12-26 03:26 PM] Deciusmus: I was envisioning an actual buffer realm, not just a line
[2023-12-26 03:26 PM] Deciusmus: But the whole realm could be called Sunset Gate
[2023-12-26 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: Right
[2023-12-26 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: Or, the buffer realm doesn’t need to be a realm really
[2023-12-26 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: The Sunset Gate is the line Umbreath cannot pass due to the terms of his exile
[2023-12-26 03:29 PM] rsulfuratus: Various minor fey allies (strong but not archfey) of ethlenn occupy the sunward side to keep watch
[2023-12-26 03:30 PM] rsulfuratus: But it isn’t really a realm - there is no archfey in control
[2023-12-26 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: Basically, here is where I think we've landed on Duskmire....
    
    Originally, it was the fey realm concurrent with the Darkwood, which has always been "the Darkwood" even in Drankorian times, for undetermined reasons. This realm was given to Umbraeth by Ethlenn as part of his exile, which is at an undetermined date, but predates Cloudspinner's imprisonment.
    
    Once Cloudspinner is exiled, the opportunity arises to expand to the west, which Umbraeth eagerly does, until he reaches the fortified borders of Shimmersong in the west and the `<unnamed Ulrich fey>` to the north.
    
    Then, when the Great War disrupts `<unnamed Ulrich fey>` he expands north as far as the Wistel, where he encounters another strong archfey, the `<big talking animals fey>`, and west, until he encounters `<scary thing in the ruins of Ulrich fey>`
[2023-12-26 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: The Sunset Gate runs basically due north from the westeren edge of the Darkwood - through Fellburn and then northward, and is a literal line Umbraeth cannot cross
[2023-12-26 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: (where the sun sets)
[2023-12-26 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: The lands sunward of the Sunset Gate (in the region labeled 3)  are not part of any domain, but there are several courts and castles of allies of Ethlenn. But this area is also especially treacherous. Time works even more strangely than usual, and without an archfey to bring order to the land, the line of the Sunset Gate is particularly unsettled, so the border between 2 and 3 is a big vague, and thus the eastern border of Duskmire is a bit vague
[2023-12-26 03:39 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, I like this
[2023-12-26 03:39 PM] rsulfuratus: are you going to copy it all to Obsidian?
[2023-12-26 03:39 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-12-26 03:40 PM] Deciusmus: Starting that now.
[2023-12-26 03:40 PM] rsulfuratus: on a totally separate topic, I'm thinking of putting the neo-easterner religion in Usk / northern Green Sea
[2023-12-26 03:40 PM] rsulfuratus: possibly Irrla as well, tbd
[2023-12-26 03:41 PM] Deciusmus: Is Ursk the right place for an interesting religion on top of all the mage stuff?
[2023-12-26 03:42 PM] Deciusmus: I guess we explicitly left out religion when doing the Artem backstory to make it easy to add in later whatever seemed right
[2023-12-26 03:42 PM] Deciusmus: And its a good place to introduce it in game.
[2023-12-26 03:43 PM] rsulfuratus: so things will be more complicated than I'm letting on
[2023-12-26 03:43 PM] rsulfuratus: but the basic idea is that it would be useful for the people of the northern Green Sea coast - east of Skaerhem all the way to the Eastern Isles - to be culturally distinct from western/southern green sea
[2023-12-26 03:44 PM] rsulfuratus: basically trying to figure out the cultural strands of the green sea
[2023-12-26 03:44 PM] rsulfuratus: you have:
    - "east northerners" that become the highland cultures of Sembara and Vostok
[2023-12-26 03:45 PM] rsulfuratus: - "ancient mariners" that are Skaer
[2023-12-26 03:45 PM] rsulfuratus: - "east southerners" that become Medju / mariner trade pensisula with undetermined religion but which has some cultural connections to each other and are outward-looking / trade oriented
[2023-12-26 03:46 PM] rsulfuratus: that leaves basically only Irrla and the north coast
[2023-12-26 03:46 PM] rsulfuratus: (this is excluding drankorian-influenced areas in Cymea / South Cymea / Western Gulf; and Dunmari-influenced areas in South Cymea)
[2023-12-26 03:47 PM] rsulfuratus: both irrla and north coast are relatively not seafaring
[2023-12-26 03:48 PM] rsulfuratus: so probably should have a fairly significant cultural break with the Hkaran mariner culture
[2023-12-26 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: Did you look throughthe old emails from last summer about mariner trade peninsula?
[2023-12-26 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: I thought there was some good stuff there, and I think we were leaning towards the "divine spark" religion as north coast/Irrla
[2023-12-26 03:48 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-12-26 03:49 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the ^^ is basically a summary of those discussions
[2023-12-26 03:49 PM] Deciusmus: Right.
[2023-12-26 03:50 PM] Deciusmus: I'd add that the above shouldn't imply that the eastern isles themselves (which are quite large) are not another cultural strain TBD
[2023-12-26 03:50 PM] rsulfuratus: right, eastern isles themselves are strange and unique and potentially dominated by non-humans anyway
[2023-12-26 03:51 PM] Deciusmus: I liked this idea for the MTP itself:
    The overriding attitude of MTP religion though is one that says: love your gods for if you do, they will watch over you. And there is also a strong sense of: the more love you give, the more love you have to give. This very strongly encourages adopting lots of additional gods. I am imaging the most religious folks having rosary bead style chains of symbols of many different gods and ships decorated with totems to many different gods, the more the better.
[2023-12-26 03:52 PM] Deciusmus: which doesn't really impact putting divine spark up in Ursk/Irrla
[2023-12-26 03:52 PM] Deciusmus: (plus this
    The divine spark religion doesn’t actually contribute gods to this mix, but it does contribute a meditative tradition that the MTP people see as a way to get closer to the gods, and so there is a unusual semi-Buddhist style self-awareness / meditation philosophy that floats around. This leads to some folks say chanting a sutra to twelve different gods to strengthen their connection to them.)
[2023-12-26 03:52 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, there is a lot of good stuff about MTP there but not my current focus, at least not until you do the cursed demon waters sidequest
[2023-12-26 03:56 PM] rsulfuratus: the things that are currently not clear in my mind are:
    - is Irrla culturally related to Ursk/north coast or is it a distinct thing? 
    - how big of a cultural break is the Skaer / Vostok Mountains?
    - how long has Ursk been settled? Is the isolation a relatively new thing or does this go back 1000 years?
[2023-12-26 03:56 PM] Deciusmus: Anyway, yes, I think that all makes sense especially the "northern" route - basically a big split between the Vos (east northerns), Skaer (ancient mariner), and Ursk/Irrla/NorthCoast, which themselves are quite distinct from the "east southerns" who end up being the basis of MTP/Medju
[2023-12-26 03:56 PM] Deciusmus: My instinct is that irrla is distinct
[2023-12-26 03:57 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that is my instinct too
[2023-12-26 03:58 PM] rsulfuratus: although that could theoretically still leave the possibility of Irrla as a part of the divine spark culture if there was an early split between Ursk/north coast and Irrla w/i the divine spark tradition. e.g. could have a indian/japanese buddhist kind of thing
[2023-12-26 04:00 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2023-12-26 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: As far as Ursk, the old Artem backstory thread had a lot of good ideas
[2023-12-26 04:05 PM] Deciusmus: But I think it was pretty marginal land until the various Urskian magical rituals were developed
[2023-12-26 04:06 PM] Deciusmus: Also the Artem backstory had the novja which we had theorized were a different cultural strain
[2023-12-26 04:06 PM] rsulfuratus: oh yes, that is going to come back
[2023-12-26 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: But I think it works best if Ursk has grown a lot in the last 300-500 years, since the various magical rituals were established, but that without those rituals it is a pretty marginal land and never had large population
[2023-12-26 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: perhaps there are two strains of divine spark people on Irrla and scattered along the northern green sea coast, and for whatever reason the north green sea coast folk turn away from large-scale seafaring
[2023-12-26 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: and, if not exactly isolationist, have low population densities, no big cities, and weird dangerous crap like vampires and dragons to deal with, so they develop a low-key culture based around low population denisties
[2023-12-26 04:10 PM] Deciusmus: depending on your plans, this culture could become the novja, or the novja could be a more Vostok/northern group heading east
[2023-12-26 04:12 PM] Deciusmus: But I think Skaer is a big cultural break. I think the Ursk culture is not particularly similar to Skaer/Vostok at all
[2023-12-26 04:13 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, okay. still a few moving pieces I'm trying to decide what the most fun would be
[2023-12-26 04:13 PM] Deciusmus: Alternatively, the novja could be culturally related to Skaer
[2023-12-26 04:13 PM] rsulfuratus: if the novja are a vostok / northern group, that potentially sets up a religious conflict with kestavo vs divine spark
[2023-12-26 04:14 PM] rsulfuratus: or, you have a divine spark vs magocracy
[2023-12-26 04:15 PM] rsulfuratus: conceptually I kind of feel like either could work but from pure worldbuilding logic it is probably more likely to have north coast settlers as divine spark and then magocracy grow out of that, rather than the novja be vos-related
[2023-12-26 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: kestavo vs divine spark seems like it would be an odd set to be in conflict
[2023-12-26 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: Although I guess you could have these sense that the divine spark tradition is *usurping* the kestavo
[2023-12-26 04:18 PM] rsulfuratus: so I think it is more:
    the Vostok mountains are a serious barrier to travel, so you have basically wilds on the other side, and you get the divine spark religion out of which a magocracy grows, setting up a cultural conflict between the "old magocracy" and the novja
    
    vs
    
    the various highlander cultures spread across the entire interior Taiga, and blend in various ways, producing the Sembaran highlands, the Vos, and the ancestors of the novja with some degree of cultural continunity; then, as the magocracy develops on the coast they conquer the inland
[2023-12-26 04:19 PM] rsulfuratus: in the current day the vostok mountains and the interior (even the coast) east of Skaerhem is very inhospitable but that could be relatively recent
[2023-12-26 04:20 PM] Deciusmus: the Artem backstory kind of implied #2 but with the origin of the novja undetermined, that doesn't mean the implication has to be true
[2023-12-26 04:21 PM] rsulfuratus: I think it could swing either way, it just depends:
    is the magocracy conquering a very distinct culture (vos/highlander) or a relatively related culture (novja/divine spark who lived inland instead of on the coast)
[2023-12-26 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: I like the novja being distinct, personally.
[2023-12-26 04:22 PM] Deciusmus: Although I don't have strong feelings
[2023-12-26 04:23 PM] Deciusmus: And small differences can loom large, ultimately, so the "you are half foreign" vibe of the novja could happen even if the cultural difference isn't huge to being with
[2023-12-26 04:23 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think the novja should feel different now
[2023-12-26 04:23 PM] rsulfuratus: no matter what
[2023-12-26 04:23 PM] rsulfuratus: question is just 500 years ago, how different were they?
[2023-12-26 04:24 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I kinda of  like the idea of this band of northern-small-gods people spreading almost from coast to coast across the taiga and northern forests of Taelgar
[2023-12-26 04:27 PM] Deciusmus: And then the mariners come into the picture but on the north coast, really hug the coast, with these small scattered coastal villages. For a thousand years they might not even know that there were people way to the north, especially if the rivers are cold, frozen some of the time, and hard to navigate
[2023-12-26 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: So you end up with two low population density groups, a divine spark group who left the mariner traditions behind and live in small groups along the coast, and a (probably semi-nomadic) vos/kestavo/northern culture farther north in the forests
[2023-12-26 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: Perhaps there is a more urbanized divine spark group on Irrla, who develop in their own unique way
[2023-12-26 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: but that can be undetermined
[2023-12-26 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: Then, the magocracy arises, say 500 years ago, and urbanizes and the population grows (a lot) amongst (some section?) of the divine spark people
[2023-12-26 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: and then post-Great War they conquer the northern people
[2023-12-26 04:32 PM] rsulfuratus: hmm. yeah, this could work. will ponder a bit
[2023-12-26 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: But honestly, a single divine spark culture could work as well. Why does one group go north though?
[2023-12-26 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: The land seems marginal-ish and it isn't clear why you wouldn't end up with dense(r) coastal settlement
[2023-12-26 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: i think in that case, the idea would be that you have relatively uniform low-density settlement at first. development of rituals allows bigger cities to be protected, and you get something like an 'urban / rural' split
[2023-12-26 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: for a while these cultures just develop in peace separate from each other
[2023-12-26 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: then something changes after the great war, prompting urban culture to expand
[2023-12-26 04:37 PM] rsulfuratus: this could be whatever drives expansion in the northerner scenario as well
[2023-12-26 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, I can see how that work would, but I kinda like the small-gods-northern-band as a unifying factor across taelgar
[2023-12-26 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: But I want to organize my feywild notes and then go pack, so..
[2023-12-26 04:39 PM] Deciusmus: (go pack, not go back..)
