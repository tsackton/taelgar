[2025-09-30 07:59 PM] rsulfuratus: assuming you defeat the empress of chaos and save the heartroot, i'm trying to think of ways its magic could add something to one of delwath's magic items. i have ideas for everyone else but i'm struggling with delwath, so if you have suggestions let me know
[2025-09-30 08:00 PM] Deciusmus: Infuse shield with some kind of additional protection? Delwath in particular has pretty bad physical saves
[2025-09-30 08:02 PM] Deciusmus: Infuse the warlock rod with additional ability, although what I’m not sure… just bumping the +1 to. +2 is not that interesting but im not sure what else would be cool.
[2025-09-30 08:03 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe something connected to elves - both his sword and the warlock rod are elvish, maybe it awakens something in them?
[2025-09-30 08:04 PM] rsulfuratus: i was trying to think of a good mechanical effect to pair with "awakens some elven essence"
[2025-09-30 08:05 PM] rsulfuratus: that was my original idea but got a little stuck. probably would bump +1 to +2 but as this is likely last magic item you'd get in the campaign, in practice at least, feels like there should be more than that.
