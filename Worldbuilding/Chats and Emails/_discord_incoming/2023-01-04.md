# Discord DM – 2023-01-04

[2023-01-04 10:58 AM] Deciusmus: I have to focus on work for most of the rest of the day, but... If you are not using "folder notes" for your html publish workflow you should be. It makes clicking on the node in the tree open the the articled named after the node
[2023-01-04 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: i.e. if you have a folder called Tokra and a file inside the folder called Tokra, rather than having the tokra folder expand and the tokra note be inside the folder, clicking tokra just opens the folder and shows the tokra file

[2023-01-04 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus: ooh nice
[2023-01-04 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: You might need to pip update to the master branch from github
[2023-01-04 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: they guy fixed a bug or two recently in the folder notes
[2023-01-04 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: you can see it in action here https://msackton.github.io/taelgar1650/
[2023-01-04 11:19 AM] Deciusmus: I'm fixing the gazeteer before I go back to york, but try to not break it again -- all of the duplicate places in "worldbuilding\places_to_move" are messing up the internal links
[2023-01-04 11:19 AM] Deciusmus: so the chronicle of sembaran history is linked to the dead stuff in places to move rather than the gazeteer
[2023-01-04 11:19 AM] rsulfuratus: if you merge instead of delete it will merge links
[2023-01-04 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus: i pushed a gazeeteer reorg (following the doc) so pull that before you clean up
[2023-01-04 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus: I tested on a few files but if you are doing this systematically i will toss my changes so as not to mess anything up
[2023-01-04 11:26 AM] Deciusmus: I just fixed it all
[2023-01-04 11:26 AM] Deciusmus: I pulled first
[2023-01-04 11:26 AM] Deciusmus: am pushing my fix
[2023-01-04 11:26 AM] rsulfuratus: okay I'll revert my changes to avoid merge conflicts
[2023-01-04 11:27 AM] Deciusmus: pushed
[2023-01-04 11:27 AM] Deciusmus: the only place stll in "places to move" is Drankorian Empire as I wasn't sure where to put it
[2023-01-04 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus: central lowlands, I'll move it
[2023-01-04 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus: I'm going to add brief descriptions outlining the bounds of each region today. but have a lot of email to deal with and also trying to wrap up delwath story so doing it on and off
[2023-01-04 02:19 PM] Deciusmus: Your git commit message hygine is pretty bad 😄
[2023-01-04 02:19 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, might isn't amazing, but still
[2023-01-04 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, I know. pretty much the only time I use git for collaborate we have the main branch locked and I write good pull requests and then rebase to squash all the messy commits
[2023-01-04 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: BTW, are you attached to preserving the google docs?
[2023-01-04 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: For Sembara at least, i was thinking of deleting from the google doc once I pushed stuff into Gazeeteer
[2023-01-04 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: ultimately I do want to move the entire world bible directory to obsidian, I'm not sure what the benefit of deleting stuff is?
[2023-01-04 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: well, for the sembara doc, it helps me remember what I've done
[2023-01-04 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: ah I see, delete the text as you go.
[2023-01-04 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: given I'm doing things in bits and pieces
[2023-01-04 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2023-01-04 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: for now can you just strikethough the sections you move? should be nearly as fast as deleting and pretty obvious
[2023-01-04 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: yup
[2023-01-04 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: what do you think of this:
[2023-01-04 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-F21B5.png]]
[2023-01-04 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: links are all live
[2023-01-04 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: its a mermaid chart form of family tree
[2023-01-04 08:32 PM] rsulfuratus: I kinda like having the categories on the graph in color. Not sure having the words clickable really matters, the links are right there on the page
[2023-01-04 08:38 PM] Deciusmus: mostly I was playing around with how to make family trees because it is alot easier to do it in mermaid than as images, I find
[2023-01-04 08:38 PM] Deciusmus: But I can revert the dunmari one if you don't like it (or use styles to re-add the colors)
[2023-01-04 08:39 PM] Deciusmus: real goal is this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-5A300.png]]
[2023-01-04 08:40 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think for general purpose family trees where ones don't exist it is nice to have that option, I'd just not bother replacing existing stuff. if you could make it look more like a traditional family tree (without the weird nameless squares representing parental relationships) it would be nicer too, I think. it just looks a bit weird to me.
[2023-01-04 08:46 PM] Deciusmus: no way to do it without the weird nameless squares at the moment
[2023-01-04 08:47 PM] Deciusmus: https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/issues/1747
[2023-01-04 08:50 PM] Deciusmus: looks better for the sembaran house where mostly the wives/husbands dont matter
![[../_discord_assets/image-4EA93.png]]
[2023-01-04 09:15 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-01-04 09:24 PM] rsulfuratus: btw, if either of us renames a page, we should try to keep the old name as an alias, otherwise you risk breaking links to session notes and other non-shared stuff (the old links become orphans). i am looking for ways to find all orphan links now, which would allow you to create them and then merge the ones that exist (which would fix linking issues)
[2023-01-04 09:34 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a plugin called "dangling links" that is seems to work to list all dangling links. fixing a bunch now
[2023-01-04 09:37 PM] rsulfuratus: pulling up a lot of typos
[2023-01-04 09:46 PM] rsulfuratus: I pushed a commit that fixes dangling links, but you should check that it doesn't mess up anything on your end (e.g., a link you had to a file that wasn't shared, which is now broken).
[2023-01-04 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: I was pretty indiscriminate but would be easy to be careful to only fix broken links that are obviously wrong or which point to a renamed file
[2023-01-04 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: all the stubs I created are in worldbuilding
[2023-01-04 09:48 PM] rsulfuratus: btw if you can put the rest of the scrying requests into the delwath chat tonight, I can update that later tonight so you have a chance to look at in the morning - i have a busy day tomorrow so want to get the last scrying log written tonight
[2023-01-04 10:26 PM] Deciusmus: I sent scrying
[2023-01-04 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: Also one of my players is asking about the difference between the Wildling and the Wrydling, I pushed a few changes... basically making the wildling about nature and the wrydling about chaos of humanity/human spirit/inward-mental type things (as well as giving the wrydling care over transgender people, which seems to fit, and my group is very queer so I'm trying to make an effort to highlight queer-forward stuff)
[2023-01-04 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that is consistent with my docs, I think? the wyrdling is kind of a combination of the Bastard from the Curse of Chalion books and the Norns/Fates type gods from Greek/Norse myths
[2023-01-04 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: the wildling is really kind of the generic nature diety
[2023-01-04 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus: I had a whole abbey of the wyrdling in the Chasa river valley you never went to that fleshed this out a bit.
[2023-01-04 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus: Solas Abbey
    
    The building is reminiscent of some Tuscan abbeys, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Sant%27Antimo. Sits above the river on a downslope of a hill, near a minor tributary. 
    
    While no longer occupied by a religious order, the structure itself is relatively intact, although most of the outbuildings are gone. The original chapel of the Wyrdling remains well-kept, and the current occupant has established quarters in the old chapter room. 
    
    A large statue of the Wyrdling in human form, depicted as a two-faced jester, one male, one female, and both with inscrutable expressions dominates the inside of the chapel. The walls are plain stone, but there are three large stained glass windows which depict: a large thunderstorm that looks like it is being held back by a rainbow; a group of children being fed by apples plucked from the sky by a creature that looks like a satyr; a person being hugged by what look like arms of wind, and an evil spirit flying out of them. 
    
    There is a strange feeling about the place, not exactly a sense of peace but a sense of belonging. Whatever doubts you might feel about yourself, your place in the world, you feel like someone hears them and cares. 
    
    The abbey is currently occupied by a lone hermit/priest, who goes by Mel. 
    
    This is a safe place to rest - shadow hunters cannot get here.
[2023-01-04 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus: Mel
    Nonbinary Chardonian, priest of the Wyrdling, lives in Solas Abbey
    
    Description: An middle aged person, maybe in their late 40s or early 50s, but has a kind of ageless look. Smooth, rounded face, short cropped hair, ambiguously gendered features.
    
    Mannerisms: Slow and deliberate in everything. Likes to listen before speaking.
    
    Game purpose: Provide a safe place to rest and recover. Possible info-dump, healing resources.
[2023-01-04 10:36 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that all fits with my (minor) changes
[2023-01-04 10:36 PM] Deciusmus: It is quite consistent with what I was thinking, but some of the overview material I think didn't highlight as much
[2023-01-04 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. the one thing I might want to keep is having weather associated with the wyrdling, not the wildling, playing up the association with chance/luck/fate and storms. which also indirectly makes the wyrdling a sort of alternate patron of sailors of a sort
[2023-01-04 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: I liked having the weather with the wildling
[2023-01-04 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: but it could move..
[2023-01-04 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: maybe the wyrdling is associated with the effect of the weather, whereas the wildling is associated with the weather itself
[2023-01-04 10:40 PM] Deciusmus: that isn't explained that well... But the wildling seems like the one who would be associated with a major storm or whatever, the divine who is tied to the changing of the seasons and the monsoon and things like that
[2023-01-04 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus: right, I think I see what you are saying
[2023-01-04 10:40 PM] Deciusmus: the wyrdling though might be associated with the luck of the wind, the chance of rain; the one sailors pray to for good winds
[2023-01-04 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus: if the monsoon rains don't come you worry that you offended the wilding; if you want good weather for your wedding day you make an offering to wyrdling
[2023-01-04 10:41 PM] Deciusmus: right, exactly
[2023-01-04 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus: I like that the Eight Divines are generally pretty impersonal and abstract, since it fits with the kind of Drankorian feeling. but I also think it is nice to have some that play against type so to speak and the wyrdling seems a good candidate. also contrasts with the very impersonal sense of the wildling as nature writ large
[2023-01-04 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus: the sibyl and maybe the wanderer also might have that kind of more personal feeling, with the mother, the father, and the wildling as the most vast and impersonal
[2023-01-04 10:50 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I like that
[2023-01-04 10:51 PM] Deciusmus: I have one player who is a paladin of the wanderer and one who is a trickster domain fey-curious priest of the wyrdling from Tyrwingha
[2023-01-04 10:51 PM] Deciusmus: So these are going to come up a lot
