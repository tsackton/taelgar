# Discord DM – 2025-01-28

[2025-01-28 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus: i am almost done with my multiverse rewrite - my goal is to get all this integrated into the next taelgarverse update this weekend. so i might work next on a bit of TOC and general reorg. 
    
    the general goal is to clean up the taelgarverse TOC which I think is a bit too inclusive, and use more things like having a list of the mos numena gods on the pantheon page instead of having each god in the sidebar nav. 
    
    as a side effect, i'm thinking about a few reorgs of the main obsidian vault. my main goals are:
     (1) I like the in-world style a lot but it is a lot of work (if enjoyable) and not always appropriate. i am wondering - but not settled - on whether it makes more sense to have in-world vs above-table directories to make it clearer what is what. 
    (2) i increasingly think there are only a few directories where we want to copy the nav structure from the obsidian vault directly to markdown, which opens up more possibilities for an obsidian reorg
    (3) often find it faster to search for a file than pull it up in the nav, but obsidian's search is kind of terrible since it doesn't prioritize file names. this makes me want to reorg the directory structure to be faster to find things. 
    (4) a lot of the directory structure was created early on and the kinds of pages we want/have have changed so it is worth a look to see if everything still makes sense
    
    a rough idea for a proposal follows
[2025-01-28 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus: unchanged:
    Background - canonical pages of worldbuilding background information; i think always written above-table, and never published
    Campaigns - campaign-specific player-facing information
    Worldbuilding - per recent reorg
    Things - canonical pages of things or classes of things that exist in world; generally written above-table, generally published with some exclusions (^1)
    People - canonical pages about people; generally written above-table, generally published with some exclusions, primary purose is a dramatis personae for games (^2)
    Gazetteer - canonical pages of places; written in a mix of styles but usually above-table or simple factual statements, generally published with some exclusions
[2025-01-28 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus: (footnotes in a bit)
[2025-01-28 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus: possible changes:
    Cosmology - currently includes gods, planes, and religion; does not include religious festivals or holidays, and does not include gazetteer-style descriptions of locations on other planes (including fey realms or specific domains of shadow)
    
    Proposed new content - canonical in-world details about the other planes, and named powers of these planes (basically, the 'extraplanar powers' category moves here). religion moves elsewhere.
    
    Proposed new content 2 - just the multiverse. gods and religion move elsewhere, nothing new is added. entirely written in-world.
[2025-01-28 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: possible changes:
    Time - currently has the Calendar Eras page and then some religious stuff. maybe should just move calendar eras to Background and combined festivals with religion.
[2025-01-28 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus: possible changes:
    Species - ideally I think this would have three kinds of content: overview pages of "species typologies", e.g. "elementals", "undead", "~Elder Folk~", written in-world style; player-facing overviews of playable races and common non-playable races in the style of the current elf/dwarf/etc page, written in a blend of above-table and in-world styles but focused on culture, lore, etc; player-facing non-mechanical / campaign-independent details about playing a species that focuses on "what you should think about re: this species" type things (e.g., names could go here, and some of the stuff in "Campaigns/mechanics"
[2025-01-28 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus: complicated changes:
    History and Events are a huge muddle with no clear indication of what goes where. History has some overview pages, a few scattered undated events, and "historical places" (although "historical people" are in People). events has events organized by time, but some of the (e.g. the Riving) are unclear why they are here not History (or Cosmology). i'm not sure what to do here, exactly
[2025-01-28 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: complicated changes:
    Groups is basically "anything a person can be a part of, except religion". possibly this is fine and we shoud move religions here. it might be worth introducing a bit more of a top-level groups hierarchy for navigational purposes. e.g., could have: Religions, Cultures, Organizations, Families as top-level or something. Orc Hordes and Hobgobling Clans are possibly more equivalent to realms than anything else? Hard to say.
[2025-01-28 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus: complicated changes:
    Primary Sources - I'm not sure this directory is worthwhile? the more we incorporate in-world descriptions into text the less sensible it feels to have primary sources segregated into a single directory. most of what is here is either songs (actually hard to place, but could be in background), stories that have been told in game (dunmari myths mostly, could be in history or dunmar or religion), stories for vibes (could go in species or whatever they are vibing about), books or letters with in-world text (could go in thiings)
[2025-01-28 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus: footnotes:
    ^1: Things of course has some bleed-over into campaigns and perhaps should generally not be published? the distinction between "world magic items pages" and "campaign magic item pages" has always been a bit arbitrary but maybe that is fine
[2025-01-28 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus: ^2: Historical Figures, Extraplanar Powers, and PCs have always been slightly weird categories in People. I'm not sure I'd want to change them, just want to think a bit about whether this is fully correct. E.g., do Historical Figures belong in History? Do Extraplanar Powers belong in Cosmology (with gods, if gods remain in cosmology)? PCs probably stay but might belong in Campaigns?
[2025-01-28 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: anyway - that is a huge wall of text and now i'm going to vanish for meetings for the next few hours. only goal during working hours today is finishing cosmology updates if I have time so won't push any more substantial updates. 
    
    if i have a lot more time than I expect, I might write up a proposed "Purpose of Directories" document to try to solidify some of this brainstorming without committing to anything
[2025-01-28 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: feel free to dump random thoughts or just ignore this entirely for now
[2025-01-28 11:55 AM] Deciusmus: A few thoughts....
    
    `**`People**: I think the People folder should be reserved for _dramatis persona_ style descriptions of individuals. The published information should read relatively in-world, i.e. what a PC would write if they were taking notes on everyone they encountered. Roleplaying notes or mechanics/leveled class type information should be ain a Campaign:None tag. 
    
    - Powerful creatures who might have myths and legends about them should probably go in (TBD) but not people
    
    
    Historical people are a bit of a problem, as there are a few categories of historical people:
    - "important" people for whom it might be worth writing a few "in-world" style paragraphs (such and such scholar thinks they did blah, contradicted by... etc - examples might include Avatus, Asuddha, Cece I, Eudomes, Amloch)
    - "little" people who just happen to be dead or long dead. The only difference between these and regular people is that they died potentially a long time ago - but likely some part of them was encountered in game (i.e. Marius of Drankor or Celine Essford)
    - "rulers" people who have pages just to help track dynasties and regnal lists and what not (most people in Sembaran Royalty)
    - "staging" people who were invented just to have a name on a document or report (i.e. Adele Laurent or Ila or )
[2025-01-28 11:56 AM] Deciusmus: I think in general it is worth moving the "important" people to History the "staging" people to staging, and then having a People\Sembaran Royalty or whatever rather than a People\Historical Figures\Sembaran Royalty
[2025-01-28 11:57 AM] Deciusmus: Alternatively, maybe it is better to just kinda have a loose organization under "People" for every page that reflects a specific meetable entity
[2025-01-28 11:57 AM] Deciusmus: and just have some pages in a different style
[2025-01-28 11:59 AM] Deciusmus: Cosmology: I would make it just the multiverse. Make a separate top level folder for Relgion and move gods under each religion's section
[2025-01-28 12:00 PM] Deciusmus: Argueably groups should be in People
[2025-01-28 12:15 PM] Deciusmus: To expand a bit... I think we have basically three types of pages:
    
    * "dramatis persona" style pages, which tend to be relatively short, frontmatter heavy, and similar in spirit to the type of thing you would write in a glossary or dramatis persona in a novel. 
    * "Wikipedia" style pages, which tend to be relatively long and cover in-world information from a position of omniscience. 
    * "In-world" style pages, which is mostly just the stuff you have been doing for Multiverse, which is explicitly written from a position of uncertainity, and is written from the perspective of a research or highly educated person in world
[2025-01-28 12:16 PM] Deciusmus: I guess there is a fourth type which is "mechanics" pages, which are explicilty written to address player rather than character concerns. But these are fairly small I think
[2025-01-28 12:20 PM] Deciusmus: It might be better to say that we have 3 styles of "wikipedia" page:
    * Pages written from the perspective of a "in-game" encyclopedia article: omniscient, in that it states the true facts about the world, not the theories or controversies, but character-facing, i.e. it is written in a way that would read basically sensibly to a character
    * Pages written from the perspective of an "out-game" encyclopedia article: omniscient and character-facing but includes player-facing language (i.e. real world analogs or roleplaying advice or whatever)
    * Pages written from the perspective of a "author's note/meta" perspective
[2025-01-28 12:26 PM] Deciusmus: If I was looking for a radical reorganization I think I'd look at these types of things to help categorize.
    
    Would it make sense to do something like
    
    * Cosmology: "in-world" pages about the multiverse, including any long speculative pages about certain people or places (but the key thing is these are all in the "in-world" style)
    * Religion: "Wikipedia" and "dramatis persona" style pages, organized by specific religion, not type of god, about religious cultures and traditions, holidays, and gods (would potentially benefit from eventually having some more "in-world" pages written)
    * Civilizations and Cultures: "Wikipedia" style articles about civilizations and cultures; no dramatis persona stuff here
    * Gazeteer: "dramatis persona" style pages about places
    * People: "dramatis persona" style pages about people and groups of people
    * Species: "Wikipedia" and "in-world" style pages about species
    * History: "wikipedia" and "in-world" style pages about the past
    * Events: "dramastic persona" style pages about specific events
[2025-01-28 12:27 PM] Deciusmus: * Background: Wikipedia style pages written from a "author/meta" perspective
[2025-01-28 12:29 PM] Deciusmus: There are some grey areas:
    * When does a basic page about a realm get "big enough" to move to Civilizations and Cultures from Gazetteer?
    * When does a basic page about a archfey or fey domain get "in-world" enough to move to Cosmology from People or Gazetteer (and where does a long page describing the culture of Twilight's Grace go? Civilization and Cultures or Cosmology)
    * What is the line between "history" and "events"
[2025-01-28 12:30 PM] Deciusmus: And some questions:
    * Is it a good idea to split based on "Type of page" rather than "thing the page describes"
    * Does it make sense to have the Sembara page or Dunmar page outside of Gazetteer?
[2025-01-28 12:30 PM] Deciusmus: Also the above doesn't touch on things at all
[2025-01-28 12:31 PM] Deciusmus: Another grey area: does specieis or civilization and culture cover elvish civilization?
[2025-01-28 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus: just to step back, i think the main goals of the directory structure in obsidian should be:
    (1) make it easy to do worldbuliding and session prep - it should be easy to find things without having to search. 
    (2) facilitate "worldbuilding projects" by linking things you want to update together in on place
    (3) serve as a way to auto-generate navigation sidebars for subsets of the vaul that are largest published as-is
[2025-01-28 12:35 PM] Deciusmus: I am about to go get lunch then have a meeting but one quick thought -- for finding things I always just us the "find or create a note" feature, I never use the directory structure
[2025-01-28 12:36 PM] Deciusmus: I find the directory structure very useful for (2) though
[2025-01-28 12:36 PM] Deciusmus: and (3)
[2025-01-28 12:36 PM] Deciusmus: Partly for (1) I find the diretory structure way too deep to be comfortable for cleenseau
[2025-01-28 12:37 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. to get to Essford Manor is 6 levels deep. It is much easier to just type ess into the search and pick
![[../_discord_assets/image-B9746.png]]
[2025-01-28 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i actually didn't know about the find or create note feature, that is very helpful
[2025-01-28 12:38 PM] Deciusmus: but I like having a "Cleenseau Region" folder because I publish it as a top level sidebar nav from https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/campaigns/cleenseau-campaign/cleenseau-campaign/
[2025-01-28 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus: it might actually be fine to just tackle directory reorganization piecemeal instead of all at once
[2025-01-28 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus: i might make a new "Vault Organization" page to track things
[2025-01-28 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus: in particular, I'm motivated to reorganize Cosmology, having just worked on it extensively, but not sure I want to decide about how History and Events are split up all in one big sweep
[2025-01-28 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus: but it would be nice to have documentation of folders that are "clean" and those that are not
[2025-01-28 12:49 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that’s not a bad idea
[2025-01-28 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: My motivation is Gazetter because I’m trying to go through each folder for each region as I do the landing pages
[2025-01-28 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: I think we can agree that religion and gods should move to Religion folder as well as holidays
[2025-01-28 12:52 PM] Deciusmus: The open question would be should realm “big pages” move out of Gazetter
[2025-01-28 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus: I'd keep realm big pages in Gazetteer. if i'm working on a Chardonian Empire cleanup I want everything in one place
[2025-01-28 01:01 PM] Deciusmus: I’m not totally sure. If I’m working on trying to make a Dunmar style page on sembara I actually care more about religion and history than the details of a timber village in the barony of Aveil
[2025-01-28 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: hrm. maybe.
[2025-01-28 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: it is very annoying for taelgarverse though as I definitely want Dunmar to be the landing page for the Dunmar nav structure
[2025-01-28 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: but maybe that can be done manually
[2025-01-28 01:03 PM] Deciusmus: I was wondering if See more: [[Realm of Sembara]] is the best solution
[2025-01-28 01:03 PM] Deciusmus: Ie keep the Gazetter page short “dramitis persona” style no matter what and link to a longer page
[2025-01-28 01:04 PM] rsulfuratus: ah. hmm. maybe
[2025-01-28 01:07 PM] Deciusmus: For example, if I started a project to better define the Zimkovan realms I’m not sure that the best way to tackle culture and religion and politics and government would be on the separate Ardlas/Breva/etc pages
[2025-01-28 01:09 PM] Deciusmus: I’m not even sure there has to be a single answer
[2025-01-28 01:09 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-01-28 01:09 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway, for now, I think the big change that is obvious is we need a "Gods and Religion" top-level directory for gods, religions, and festivals, which then leads to cosmology having just multiverse stuff (for now) and time disappearing (with calendar eras ->` background)
[2025-01-28 01:10 PM] rsulfuratus: i am going to implement that, but leave any other major changes for now
[2025-01-28 01:10 PM] rsulfuratus: am also going to type up a vault organization note.
[2025-01-28 01:11 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm pushing the reorg above now even though some things aren't perfect to prevent messy conflicts if you do anything this afternoon
[2025-01-28 01:11 PM] rsulfuratus: okay pushed
[2025-01-28 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed an in-progress Vault Organization page. lmk if you see anything that you don't agree with there
[2025-01-28 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: mostly working the rest of the afternoon so will be sporadic to reply
[2025-01-28 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: Strong agreement on catagorization of page types and Background + Cosmology + Gods and Religions
[2025-01-28 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: And Campaigns, modulo the open questions
[2025-01-28 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: Less sure about species. In general, the broad "species" topic contains:
    1 Player-facing pages about playable species and mechanics
    2 Meta pages about typologies and "how to make up new species"
    3 in-world or character pages about odd/unusual/scary species ("enemies" broadly)
    4 in-world or character pages about playable specieis
    5 in-world or character pages about specific cultures or realms of playable species (?)
    
    Right now I think the lines between 4 and 5 are fairly unclear
[2025-01-28 03:01 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. dwarven coins + dwarven kingdoms are kinda off in their own spots
[2025-01-28 03:01 PM] Deciusmus: I'm also not sure how pages about dwarven religion intersect with this
[2025-01-28 03:04 PM] Deciusmus: also there are questions like "human cultures of taelgar" - is that in species?
[2025-01-28 03:05 PM] rsulfuratus: hmmm
[2025-01-28 03:07 PM] rsulfuratus: i think 1-4 fit most obviously in species, with 5 fitting either in gazetteer or tbd
[2025-01-28 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't think it has to be perfect, and can be revised depending on how gazetteer ends up
[2025-01-28 03:08 PM] Deciusmus: Sure
[2025-01-28 03:08 PM] Deciusmus: This is where I am starting to think a Civilizations and Cultures folder would help a lot
[2025-01-28 03:09 PM] Deciusmus: it makes it easy to link out from other areas to a See more: Dwarven Culture
[2025-01-28 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-01-28 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: it makes it a little arbitrary why history and religion are separate (history less arbitrary than religion)
[2025-01-28 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: but maybe that's fine
[2025-01-28 03:10 PM] Deciusmus: so then the rule could be we have a _page_ but not a _folder_ for each playable species in species
[2025-01-28 03:11 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-01-28 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: and if you start wanting to have several different pages, link them to Civilizations and Cutlure/Elves/blah blah
[2025-01-28 03:11 PM] rsulfuratus: elven cycle of generations could be in background, to be honest
[2025-01-28 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2025-01-28 03:13 PM] Deciusmus: So I might say something like:
    
    The species folder should focus on global truths about a species - lifecycle, biology, special abilities, as well as 'big picture' history/culture/religion. Details about a specific culture ("sentinenls dwarven kingdoms", "people of the rainbow") or just longer articles about species goes in civ/`<species>`
[2025-01-28 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: that means the species organization could be something like:
    
    Species/Mechanics/...
    Species/Extraplanar/...
    Species/Unusual/...
    Species/`[Elves, Dwarves, Humans, Orcs, Hobgoblins, Halflings, Stoneborn, Lizardfolk]`
[2025-01-28 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: or maybe a "goblinoids" instead of hobgoblins, or a folder for "Evil" that includes goblins,etc + orcs
[2025-01-28 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: then languages moves to Civilization and Culture/Langauges
[2025-01-28 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: and the mechanics/species and mechanics/species of taelar moves to specieis/mechanics
[2025-01-28 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, okay, i can get behind that. i am still a little lukewarm on civilizations and culture, and I'd kind of prefer to hold off big gazetteer reorgs until we finish the region reorg.
[2025-01-28 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: but i think it is find to dump things in background for now, and the pull stuff out of background later
[2025-01-28 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: thats fair, although the languages pages are valuable to publish
[2025-01-28 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: but it is easy to leave languages in species for now as well
[2025-01-28 03:20 PM] rsulfuratus: it is also easy to publish a specific background page, just need to update the ignore file to keep that page, and then manually add it to toc
[2025-01-28 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: true
[2025-01-28 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: ok, I'm going to move around species but not introduce a civ + culture just ye
[2025-01-28 03:20 PM] rsulfuratus: also update vault page as needed if you can
[2025-01-28 03:39 PM] Deciusmus: species isn't really finished, but it has well defined content
[2025-01-28 03:41 PM] rsulfuratus: i was moving things into finished if there is no further page reorganization to do, not if all the pages were finished.
[2025-01-28 03:42 PM] Deciusmus: there is still an open question, i.e.
    
    `*`Open Questions*: Where do larger pages about culture of species go, i.e. [[People of the Rainbow]], [[Dwarven Kingdoms]], or [[Story About Halfling Merchants]]
[2025-01-28 03:43 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe add an Open Questions at the bottom for things like that
[2025-01-28 03:44 PM] rsulfuratus: that is a slightly more complicated decision than the species org itself - i think we just decided they *don't* belong in species, so from the species point of view no open questions. but from a larger point of view those need a consistent home
[2025-01-28 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: I put "creating new species" in species\mechanics as it seemed to fit there
[2025-01-28 03:45 PM] Deciusmus: and I'm keeping the duplicated landing pages - one at Species\Species which is "character facing" and one at Species\Mechanics\Species of Taelgar which is "player facing"
[2025-01-28 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: pushed
[2025-01-28 04:25 PM] Deciusmus: I'm working on Northwest Coast landing page... A few questions. Any you don't get to I'll add to doc with check/tim later tonight
[2025-01-28 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: (Northwest coast = basiclly Mawar + Voltara region).
[2025-01-28 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: Question 1: Non-humans. Any major non-human settlements other than salt lizardfolk on mawar?
[2025-01-28 04:47 PM] rsulfuratus: major? nothing particularly canonically determined, but there probably are some somewhere
[2025-01-28 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: I guess it is kinda hard to write the gazetter landing page for this region in particular, because it isn't just a "mostly unknown" place like the far north or far south but it is also not very complete from a development standpoint
[2025-01-28 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't think it is necessary to completely preserve an in-world / character-facing writing style for the region pages
[2025-01-28 05:01 PM] rsulfuratus: alternatively i think it is fine to write it as if the region were complete, and just add details as more stuff gets invented later on
[2025-01-28 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: (although i kind of like a signal of "empty because no one has invented stuff here" vs "empty because it is wiilderness" in the player-facing sections, not just dm notes)
[2025-01-28 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: I actually think it is mostly a problem with the Northwest Coast and the Western Green Sea
[2025-01-28 05:07 PM] Deciusmus: If I think about the "civilizations and cultures" for each region, I think we have:
    
    Far North: mystery/wilderness
    Northwest Coast: fuzzy
    North Sentinels: Deno'qai, stoneborn, dwarves but with a "wilderness" vibe
    Greater Sembara: extensive/well defined
    North Green Sea: Ursk + dwarves and stoneborn in the Svijnaro mountains + Vagardi + wilderness/mystery vibe
    Greater Chardon: I think well defined? I asume you have a decently clear idea of non-chardon cultures, if any
    Central Highlands: dwarves/elves/deno'qai/stoneborn some intentionally blank patches (Myrani Gap)
    Upper Istaros: Aurbez/Orenlas + mystery/wilderness
    Western Green Sea: very unclear
    Eastern Green Sea: intentionally blank
    Apporia + Nevos: Illoria + mystery/intentionally blank
    Dunmar: well defined
    Drankor: mystery/wilderness
    Far South: intentionally blank
[2025-01-28 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: Or to put it another way, regions are in general either "faraway civilizations", "wilderness + mystery", "wilderness + mystery with 1 or 2 well known civs", "mostly populated"
[2025-01-28 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: the hardest regions to write are the two "mostly populated" regions that are not well characterized yet: Northwest Coast + Western Green Sea
[2025-01-28 05:25 PM] rsulfuratus: i have a bit of a related problem with the shadowfolds - there is not much invented about them, almost nothing compared to e.g. energy realms or feywild, but they are not intentionally mysterious like e.g. some of the "outer planes" or the far realms. 
    
    my current solution is sticking this at the bottom:
    
    `*`(While there is more to say about the Shadowfolds, and significant lore likely exists, it largely has not been invented yet! - Eds.)
[2025-01-28 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: my current solution is just to move on to a different region
[2025-01-28 05:26 PM] rsulfuratus: i did all the easy planes already
[2025-01-28 05:31 PM] Deciusmus: here is a question: the current climate of the western Endless Ocean is heavily influenced by the existence of the sayuna islands, which diverts the major currents far to the north and south, and makes the main coast something like the Tasman Sea between australias and new zealand
[2025-01-28 05:31 PM] Deciusmus: is that canonical, i.e. that there is something out there that impacts the climate/currents/etc of the near Endless Ocean?
[2025-01-28 05:33 PM] rsulfuratus: the climate of the landmasses (Mawar, north Apporia, Chardon coast) is canonical. why the climate is the way it is is not
[2025-01-28 05:34 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not sure that current map has ever had much of an impact on worldbuilding
[2025-01-28 05:34 PM] Deciusmus: I don't think it really has
[2025-01-28 06:18 PM] Deciusmus: how much do you think it makes sense to put the general climate of the green sea on the eastern and western pages, or should I just add a climate sectio on the Green Sea page and link?
[2025-01-28 06:18 PM] rsulfuratus: i'd probably just link to green sea page
[2025-01-28 06:26 PM] Deciusmus: ok, I pushed completed Far North, Far South, Eastern Green Sea landing pages
[2025-01-28 08:09 PM] rsulfuratus: mostly doing non-taelgar stuff tonight, but a brief comment, trying to finalize the cosmology folder. 
    
    i'm generally leaving things in (or moving to) staging if there both no invented in-game detail and no relevant dm notes (e.g., the sun)
    
    i'm leaving things as player-facing stubs, with excludePublish`["all"]`, if there are relevant dm notes even if there is no player facing text (e.g., the moon, the stars)
[2025-01-28 08:10 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm also going to make a `["meta"]` cosmology landing page that will have all the notes in staging linked from cosmology, as well as some general guidance on tagging and categorization for the folder.
[2025-01-28 08:10 PM] rsulfuratus: (also with excludePublish`["all"]`)
[2025-01-28 08:11 PM] rsulfuratus: (might not get to any of this tonight)
[2025-01-28 08:22 PM] Deciusmus: sure; I like staging as a landing zone for basically pages that are created to have a place for brainstorming/thoughts/etc but that are not really ready yet
[2025-01-28 08:25 PM] rsulfuratus: i think what i'm going for will be obvious once i finish and push everything. 
    
    basically, imo, staging is for pages that definitely exist but which don't have any text. if there are a bunch of dm notes, i'm moving them to the correct folder with excludePublish`["all"]`
[2025-01-28 08:25 PM] rsulfuratus: (but not everything has to be organized the same way)
[2025-01-28 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: I am about to go to bed, but I've been messing around with Chardonian history, specifically trying to write a unified narrative that works with the Conclave War, Apporian history, and Mawar History. Here is what I have so far:
    
    #### The Great War and the Blood Years
    _DR 1540 - DR 1574_
    Although the [[Great War]] ended in DR 1545, the vast army of [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] and other terrors that [[Cha'mutte]] had amassed did not simply disappear. Over the next 30 years, two major wars were fought across the lands north of Chardon: the [[Conclave War]] and the to be named war against the hobgoblins. 
    
    basic idea: conclave war then in the 1560s a series of expansion of hobgoblins, stopped in 1561 or 1562, but not really peaceful - next 10 years are back and forth along the north chardon coast; but in 1574 some type of armistace line is drawn, splitting (or even leaving the hobgoblins with most of the coast). Perhaps there is another human kingdom involved here (the "yellow 5 kingdom from other maps"?) in the north, pincering the hobgoblins a bit. 
    
    chardon is settling chasa valley here
    
    #### Early Imperial Era
    _DR 1574 - DR 1597_
    During mawar renai; hobgoblins are stilla round the malakel entrance, but somewhat hemmed in by something in the north so don't really have a good expansion plan; perhaps even being somewhat decent rulers in a way; chardon growing in the chasa valley but not really an empire just yet
    
     DR 1597, when the Umbral Covenant launches the Shadow Armada to conquer Chardon, and loses badly - awakening moment - empire is working this is not like the conclave war at all leads to first serious wave of expansion
    #### Imperial Expansion
    _DR 1597 - present_
    three phases: 
    * apporia - 1597 - 1610 
    * 1650 - 1675 - conquest of hobgoblins; (mindknife war just after this)
    * 1690 - 1710 - chaylte
[2025-01-28 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus: there are some significant details in various of my notes in various places, and also some unwritten notes on modern day chardonian empire that may determine how history plays out.
[2025-01-28 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g.:
    
    Current magistros, [[Mitus Verina Auratan]].  Comes from a powerful family; his aunt, Seva Auratan, was magistros before him, and her grandfather discovered chalyte in the north making the family super rich. 
    
    Timing:
    Seva dies (aged 71), Mitus becomes Magistros: 1746
    Mitus born: 1725
    Seva becomes Magistros: 1720
    Appius dies: 1703
    First chalyte mines in north established; Voltara garrison built: 1680s
    Seva born: 1675
    Seva's grandfather discovers chalyte in north: 1671
    Appius Auratan (Seva's grandfather) born: 1620
    
    So, basically, the Auratan family in the mid 1600s is not particularly notable. Appius Auratan, Seva's grandfather, has some magical training (perhaps retired from the mage guard) and is a bit of an adventurer, and makes the discovery of rich chalyte lodes in the mountains near what is now Voltara. Returns to Chardon and with the profits of his first haul starts a mining company.
[2025-01-28 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: (the dates don't have to be exactly right)
[2025-01-28 10:24 PM] Deciusmus: That actually lines up with my timeline almost exactly
[2025-01-28 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-01-28 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus: the big unsettled things are the lake valandros area and the yeraad river valley
[2025-01-28 10:25 PM] Deciusmus: Basically I was taking the Mawar and aporia history as canon and trying to figure out how that fits with Chardon
[2025-01-28 10:26 PM] Deciusmus: The big thing is that Chardon can’t be a powerful force on Mawar doorstep until the 1650s-1680s
[2025-01-28 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus: in my head the current day empire is basically 6 pieces:
    Apporia 
    Chasa
    Yeraad
    North Coast
    Valandros
    Voltara
    
    with an order of:
    Chasa ->` Apporia ->` Valandros ->` North Coast ->` Voltara (with Yeraad unclear)
[2025-01-28 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus: but maybe swapping Valandros and North Coast
[2025-01-28 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: I think for the grand scheme of historical eras it doesn’t matter when lake valandros or Yeraad is settled necessarily
[2025-01-28 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus: this is when incorporated into chardonian empire
[2025-01-28 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: Or rather incorporated
[2025-01-28 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: North coast matters re: Mawar
[2025-01-28 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: I don’t think the north coast can be incorporated earlier than 1650s
[2025-01-28 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: Without changing the dates of the Mawar renaissance at least
[2025-01-28 10:30 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a bit of tension here since my original idea (which you either independently invented or was in notes somewhere) is that it takes chardon a long time to get strong enough to break the hold of hobgoblins on the north coast
[2025-01-28 10:31 PM] Deciusmus: Right that was in your notes
[2025-01-28 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus: so that puts mawar renaissance at the same time as "hobgoblin kingdoms to the south"
[2025-01-28 10:31 PM] Deciusmus: Which I think is ok actually
[2025-01-28 10:32 PM] Deciusmus: As long as the hobgoblins are hemmed in somehow, not expansionist
[2025-01-28 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: right. mawar is protected by mountains via land, and can easily posulate that mawar is by far the better navy than hobgoblins
[2025-01-28 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: actually the hobgoblins maybe get cut off a bit at this stage. still harass chardon to south (and east?) but mawar renaissance reinvigorates the north, e.g. the "remnant yellow kingdoms"
[2025-01-28 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus: the modern day vibe that is important to keep is that the north coast, chasa, and apporia are all basicaly loyal imperialists and still think of chardon as their saviors
[2025-01-28 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus: whereas the voltara area does not - chardon is much more of an imperial power here
[2025-01-28 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus: lake valandros and yeraad being undetermined as i'm not yet clear who actually lives there now
[2025-01-28 10:37 PM] Deciusmus: (AFK fora bit)
[2025-01-28 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus: however, voltara has always in the great library game been an isolated frontier with most of the population density actually to the west, basically along the coast in "yellow kingdom 5", which I think is definitely not ever chardonian
[2025-01-28 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus: (but no details exist about this culture)
[2025-01-28 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus: (other than the voltara vibe)
[2025-01-28 10:40 PM] Deciusmus: Right but that all fits. Basically the idea is— yellow kingdom 5 survives along the coast during the conclave war - basically as the only survivor of northern non-Drankorian kingdoms.
[2025-01-28 10:40 PM] Deciusmus: Then hobgoblins come south, bypassing yellow 5 for whatever reason (and Mawar because of mountains + magic fog)
[2025-01-28 10:41 PM] Deciusmus: Between 1556 and 1565 or whatever Chardon fights to major wars (expansionist hobgoblin and conclave), but is exhausted after that
[2025-01-28 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: 1570s-1590s are basically growth in the Chasa River valley. With hobgoblins still along the north coast but in some kind of holding pattern/stalemate
[2025-01-28 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe a few small skirmishes and reclamation of some territory along the coast
[2025-01-28 10:43 PM] Deciusmus: By ~1595 Mawar sees hobgoblins as relatively weak and the Mawar renaissance starts. Chardon also has grown but now and see itself as a strong power for the first time when it crushes the umbral convent
[2025-01-28 10:44 PM] Deciusmus: But Mawar and Chardon are still separated by the hobgoblins along the north coast, and kinda growing independentally. Chardon starts a series of expansions
[2025-01-28 10:45 PM] Deciusmus: Whatever the exact timing, the expansion towards the north coast is clearly “saving them from hobgoblins” whereas the lake expansion is less clear
[2025-01-28 10:45 PM] Deciusmus: And the voltara expansion(last) is clearly for chaylte
[2025-01-28 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: Anyway going to bed. But might mess around tomorrow depending on my workload
[2025-01-28 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah it seems to all roughly fit nicely on a high level
