# Discord DM – 2025-04-30

[2025-04-30 08:04 PM] rsulfuratus: A while ago we talked about a feywild arc in your game that might draw on some of the stuff I’ve developed recently. The cloud spinner arc is presumably wrapping up tomorrow and hopefully in about 1-2 weeks things at work will settle down a bit. So I’m close to in a position to push a bunch of new Feywild details. Is it still relevant?
[2025-04-30 08:04 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2025-04-30 08:05 PM] Deciusmus: my plot is running a bit slow because we skipped April and June, so we only have a May and July game
[2025-04-30 08:05 PM] Deciusmus: but after the lich reveal and getting the piece of the phylatcry, PCs will end up in the feywild
[2025-04-30 08:06 PM] rsulfuratus: Ah okay so that is likely July at earliest? That’s perfect
[2025-04-30 08:06 PM] Deciusmus: realistically August, as I think the lich plot will take 2 sessions
[2025-04-30 08:06 PM] rsulfuratus: Great will easily have time to clean up and push a bunch of stuff well before then
