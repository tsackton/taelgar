[2024-10-16 12:03 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a house rules rename and a bit of detail on Serenveil/de Brunes/the fey I made up from Serenveil's domain
[2024-10-16 03:05 PM] rsulfuratus: looked at the Serenveil stuff a bit, and was thinking a little more last night. 
    
    I like the vibe of Istarias basically being a pawn (at least that is how it reads to me based on your notes), and I like Serenveil as an ally (of sorts, at least) of Ethlenn, but not a vassal. 
    
    I don't yet have any good ideas for what Serenveil's motives are (open to suggestions; presumably the de Brune family cult is deeply involved in whatever this is, although perhaps they have other motivations as well). But I think the dynamic of Serenveil looking to Ethlenn for protection against a stronger bully (Umbraeth) is probably the right vibe and seems consistent with both campaigns so far.
[2024-10-16 03:16 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm not sure how much of the Umbraeth / Ethlenn dynamic is really developed or canon, but clearly in the past ~700 years (since the fall of Amberglow), Umbraeth has been grabbing territory, getting more powerful, expanding his domain, and so it is possible that Serenveil is a window into how the kind of unconnected fey feel about this, which might be largely a sense of anger at Umbraeth not necessarily for his original offenses, but for being the one with the big stick on the block. and also potentially could involve some annoyance at Ethlenn for not properly dealing with the problem (which, in their eyes, she created in the first place). especially given that Ethlenn clearly has somewhat unusual motives for an archfey given the Tyrwingha connection, etc
