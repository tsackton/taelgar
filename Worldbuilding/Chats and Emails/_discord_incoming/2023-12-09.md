[2023-12-09 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus: Vostok is supposed to be "homeland of the Vos", so people = Vos, land = tok. that gives you the ~English/Tollender translation Vosland and the variants Voslaag and Vosklad for "lowlanders" and "highlanders" which is then used synonymously with the name of the region (e.g. like Gauls/Gaul)
[2023-12-09 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus: this wikipedia page is fascinating: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country-name_etymologies
[2023-12-09 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus: main reason to care is if you want to have an "indigenous" name and a "foreign" name, e.g. Skaergenland / Skaer Islands vs Skaerhem; Vosland vs Vostok
[2023-12-09 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: E.g. Zimland as the name used by Sembarans, Zimtovia or Zimkovia as the indigenous name
[2023-12-09 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus: my general take is that is most interesting from a game/worldbuilding perspective when you have distinct cultures close together that might clash. So no one would call Dunmar Dunland or whatever so we don't care about etymology, but some future adventure might for sure be interested in the political/cultural dimensions "Sembaran" vs "East-Northerner"
[2023-12-09 11:31 AM] Deciusmus: Right, I was thinking Semvos would be "the people of the Sem"
[2023-12-09 11:31 AM] Deciusmus: Or whatever alternate, i.e. Pemvos Kambvos
[2023-12-09 11:41 AM] Deciusmus: so the "highlanders" would call themselves "Semvos" and the place Semkovia or whatever
[2023-12-09 01:05 PM] rsulfuratus: Ah right. Yes
