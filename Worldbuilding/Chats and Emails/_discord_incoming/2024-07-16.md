# Discord DM – 2024-07-16

[2024-07-16 01:28 PM] Deciusmus: any objections if I make a couple of the really big pngs jpgs?
[2024-07-16 01:43 PM] rsulfuratus: the only one I might leave is the player map
[2024-07-16 01:44 PM] rsulfuratus: although I guess you could just test if the jpeg looks noticeably worse when zoomed to 300% or whatever
[2024-07-16 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: any art can definitely be converted to jpg
[2024-07-16 01:46 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I wasn't going to touch the map; just AI art
[2024-07-16 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: I went with 1520 for the date of creation just to have something
[2024-07-16 05:35 PM] Deciusmus: just playing around with this a bit, I think this timeline isn't quite right.  The idea is that there is explosive change in Hkar in the aftermath of the northerners leaving and encountering the Elder Folk, but 300-400 years for the development of the earliest pantheons seems too long
[2024-07-16 05:37 PM] Deciusmus: the only firm date we have is Sargon was defeated no later than ~2800. (So that the philosopher's "more than 3000 years ago" works). But no reason it couldn't have been 2500 or 2200 even, right?
[2024-07-16 05:39 PM] Deciusmus: alternatively, maybe the northerners left later? like 2600
[2024-07-16 05:45 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah any of those options works. Decision is about the balance of time in the various phases of hkaran history.  There are enough unknowns that it seems a bit hard to pin down
[2024-07-16 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: on the one hand, no reason to decide
[2024-07-16 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: on the other hand, some arbitrary decisions help sometimes
[2024-07-16 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: at the moment, I am thinking something like:
    
    ~300 years of "personal deities" era. 
    ~700 years of "small gods" era
    
    Northerner migration is the ending of the small god era
    
    ~200 years of rapid change
    
    ~1500 years of the pantheonic era
[2024-07-16 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: but I'm not really sure if that is right. It's hard to know how rapidly the pantheonic era should conslidate
[2024-07-16 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: into Mos Numena
[2024-07-16 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: I think one consideration is that to a certain extent, this plays into the question of why the downfall happens. 
    
    The original conception from high school was supposed to be kind of opposed to the Tolkien mythic history of "humans are punished for challenging the gods" type thing. So the Downfall doesn't happen because humans get greedy, it happens because of evil gods or the Void Mind or whatever tbd forces. It happens to humans, basically, more like a natural disaster. 
    
    I think this, to a certain extent, argues for a relatively shorter pantheonic era. If the Void Mind is trying to stop humans, the Hkaran urban elite is developing high magic and cooperating with elves, why wait?
[2024-07-16 05:52 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I mean, I definitely like the vibe of the Downfall as a "from the outside" disaster
[2024-07-16 05:52 PM] Deciusmus: But the Void Mind might need to wait to gain strength
[2024-07-16 05:52 PM] rsulfuratus: Right, there are possible reasons why it could happen anytime, of course
[2024-07-16 05:52 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. grow the hobgoblin armies in secret or whatever
[2024-07-16 05:52 PM] Deciusmus: If the Sargon date is going to stay canonical there isn't really room to make the pantheonic era much shorter than 1500 years
[2024-07-16 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: Because I think it should definitely be true that the transition from small gods to pantheons is short
[2024-07-16 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: I don't think it makes a ton of sense for their to be a long period of "proto pantheons" that Sargon can fit into. Right?
[2024-07-16 05:54 PM] rsulfuratus: well, what there is no information about is what the Chainshroud actually was. Sarqon could be a full-fledged god worshipped by a cult.
[2024-07-16 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: I guess Sargon could be a 'big small god'
[2024-07-16 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: The other constraint is that the northern migration needs time, once it happens, to spread across Taelgar and diversify
[2024-07-16 05:55 PM] Deciusmus: So I think the northerners can't be too early
[2024-07-16 05:55 PM] Deciusmus: * i mean too late
[2024-07-16 05:56 PM] Deciusmus: Basically, my thought is that there is effectively one period of rapid change in Hkar: the evolution from small gods to big pantheonic gods.
    
    And that this period of rapid change should be:
    * Short (100 - 300 years, but probably closer to 100 than 300)
    * Soon after the Northerners leave and the humans and Elder Folk start interacting
[2024-07-16 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: So, rereading the religious history doc, I feel like the era of personal deities/cults and the early pantheonic stages could last for quite a long time. the small gods ->` pantheons does need to happen quickly
[2024-07-16 05:57 PM] rsulfuratus: for example, I'm not sure why "In a variety of ways, the era of cults quickly becomes an era of small gods. It likely starts with ancestor worship - if your mother was a powerful divine sorcerer, and you benefitted from her personal deity in life, it would be very natural to continue praying to her personal deity in death." has to be true
[2024-07-16 05:57 PM] rsulfuratus: in any case, the era of cults is kind of undeveloped
[2024-07-16 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I'm not sure it matters when the transition from personal deities to cults is
[2024-07-16 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: Similarly, the transition from "early pantheonic" to "proto-Mos-Numena" can be anytime
[2024-07-16 05:58 PM] rsulfuratus: what does seem clear is that the small gods is an important but brief transitory period, and a lot of things happen:
    - northern migrations
    - contact with elder folk
    - arrival of arcane magic in force
[2024-07-16 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: The thing that impacts everything else is basically when does the small gods ->` early pantheonic transition happen
[2024-07-16 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure if the small gods period has to be brief. You could have a short cult phase and a long small god phase, for example
[2024-07-16 06:01 PM] rsulfuratus: so there are actually some conflicted metaphysics about the outer planes and the religious history docs
[2024-07-16 06:02 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g., where do places like Arborea and the Nine Hells come from? they are supposed to be kind of inchoate belief from the early days but this conflicts a bit with the idea that it isn't until the early pantheonic days that people start imaging  extraplanar divinities
[2024-07-16 06:02 PM] rsulfuratus: in any case, that is neither here nor there for dating
[2024-07-16 06:03 PM] rsulfuratus: in my mind, the northerner migration, contact with elder folk, spread of arcane magic, and the pantheonic tradition are all tied together and happen in a relatively short window
[2024-07-16 06:03 PM] Deciusmus: Yes. Strongly agree
[2024-07-16 06:03 PM] rsulfuratus: say within about 200-500 years max
[2024-07-16 06:03 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-07-16 06:04 PM] rsulfuratus: so how much history is about right for the northerners on the main continent?
[2024-07-16 06:04 PM] Deciusmus: And of course this needs to be during the "small gods" era, but it could be that small gods only lasts 200-300 years and overlaps almost entirely with the "transition" period.
    
    Or it could be that small gods lasts 1000 years and ends with the migrations
[2024-07-16 06:05 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-07-16 06:05 PM] Deciusmus: There needs to be enough time that Zimka/Vos are well established in Sembara when the mariners show up
[2024-07-16 06:05 PM] Deciusmus: I think that's the main constraint really
[2024-07-16 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: it doesn't necessarily take the northerners that much time to get there
[2024-07-16 06:06 PM] Deciusmus: But the world isn't _that_ big. It could probably be as little as 800 years and as many as 1800
[2024-07-16 06:06 PM] Deciusmus: which says, say 2100 - 3100
[2024-07-16 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. if Tollen is founded in 3902 that implies mariners make it to Western Gulf by say 3700 at the earliest? Tollen is supposed to be one of the first mariner cities in that part of the Green Sea
[2024-07-16 06:07 PM] Deciusmus: I was using the founding of Tollen as the function "point of contact" but probably 100 years before is better
[2024-07-16 06:07 PM] rsulfuratus: give the Zimka like 8-10 generations minimal in the highlands before then only pushes their arrival back to 3100ish? plus/minus a hundred years
[2024-07-16 06:08 PM] rsulfuratus: sorry wrong math, more like 3400
[2024-07-16 06:08 PM] rsulfuratus: so assume very roughly 800-1000 years to migrate, you could have northerns make first contact with continent around 2400-2600
[2024-07-16 06:09 PM] Deciusmus: Right. Although I think 1000 years is a very long time to migrate. There are all kinds of reasons they might have been moving faster
[2024-07-16 06:10 PM] rsulfuratus: right but doesn't mess anything up for them to have been in the region for 20-30 generations, or 100 generations
[2024-07-16 06:10 PM] Deciusmus: I'd stick with my the migration should probably not be before 2000 or after 3000 but anything else could work
[2024-07-16 06:10 PM] rsulfuratus: yes I think that is good
