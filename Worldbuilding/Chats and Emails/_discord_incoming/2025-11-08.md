# Discord DM – 2025-11-08

[2025-11-08 08:50 AM] rsulfuratus: going to spend a couple hours this morning working on species. partly trying to finalize homebrew but also give the species directory the "cosmology" treatment (go through each page, reorg, make sure things are complete). 
    
    i'm proposing the following reorganization:
    
    (1) rename the top level directory from species to creatures. this gives space to add things like notes on manticore ecology if we ever feel like it
    
    (2) rename "true species" in your "what is a species" to just "species", and use "creature" as the generic word for "feeling beings on taelgar". 
    
    (3) reorganzation directory into the following subdirectories:
    - mechanics: both player-facing and dm-facing content ("playing an x", lists of playable species, dm meta-notes about creating a species and rules interactions)
    - species: character-facing encyclopedia pages about species
    - bestiary: character-facing and dm-meta pages about creatures that aren't species
    - fey: complicated enough to warrant its own subdirectory
    - extraplanar: anything not native to the material plane. can eventually be split into innner / outer if there is enough content, to match the metaphysics
    
    in the base level directory would be just some top-level stuff
[2025-11-08 10:55 AM] Deciusmus: I am also mucking about with D&D, mostly session prep and organizing a few of the Chasm worldbuilding notes. But I was going to clean up a few status/mike pages....
    
    Goblinoid is tagged check/mike, but are you working in species and I should leave it alone?
[2025-11-08 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus: yes, leave the species alone for now. working through this and will tag and push later tody
[2025-11-08 11:03 AM] Deciusmus: Btw, I think the basic idea of soulstuff being something that accretes to creatures and creates divinities potentially explains a lot of facts about Taelgarian metaphysics. Not sure if they all need explanation, but...
    
    Maybe hobgoblins are "evil" not because they don't have souls, but because their very being actively repels soulstuff, leading to a deep feeling of disconnection from the rest of Taelgar. They feel in their bones they are the only real people. (Although I'm not 100% sure how this fits in with Cha'mutte)
[2025-11-08 11:03 AM] Deciusmus: Maybe humans create gods because they - unlike any other species - can gift their soulstuff to others in some fashion, making belief into a literal mechanism of growing the power of those they (unconsicously) give soul stuff to
[2025-11-08 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah. i think it also usefully provides a metaphysical explanation for small gods like tanshi or kestavo
[2025-11-08 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: and a mechanism for "demi gods" like beryl or bhishma
[2025-11-08 11:05 AM] Deciusmus: I'm just callling the chasm the Great Chasm in links, btw
[2025-11-08 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus: i pushed a draft backstory for finnan btw. might change a few details when i look at it again but i think the basic framing likely holds
[2025-11-08 11:06 AM] Deciusmus: i saw that but haven't read it
[2025-11-08 11:08 AM] Deciusmus: how big is each hex on the world map again
[2025-11-08 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus: 24 miles
[2025-11-08 11:10 AM] rsulfuratus: double checking...
[2025-11-08 11:12 AM] Deciusmus: I'm adding a bit of rivers to the main map remind me what brush you use for rivers?
[2025-11-08 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus: Rivers: KYLE sketch pencil rough (1 or 2), play with size, flow; color `#181f5a`
[2025-11-08 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus: In Photoshop maps, current scale is 1.16 units on ruler = 50 miles.
[2025-11-08 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus: or more accurately 84 pixels equals 50 miles
[2025-11-08 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus: the hexes are 24 miles across; an edge is ~14 miles and vertex-vertex is ~28 miles
[2025-11-08 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus: this is a useful reference for scale: https://wanderinggamist.blogspot.com/2023/01/getting-sense-for-24-mile-hexes.html
[2025-11-08 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus: how many species do you think "fey" should be? options I'm considering:
    
    (A) One. All fey share a common origin story (though it is not invented yet) and there is not a sense in the feywild of differences between say pixies and beastfolk. These are differences in form, not metaphysics. Hags and similar are part of this species; dryads/nymphs and the like are fey creatures, not proper species. 
    
    (B) Two. The Medium humanoid fey are the default "fey" with a single orgin story, though in form they vary from elegant humans ("fae", but also hags) to changelings to beastfolk (including satyrs and weirder things). The "fairies", which include all the tiny flying things like pixies and sprites, have a separate story. 
    
    (C) Three or more. The common "fey" archetype - the elegant Medium humanoid - is one species. Fairies are another. Then various other groups that seem worth separating (perhaps beastfolk, perhaps hags, perhaps others?) are their own species. 
    
    I lean slightly towards (B) but can see arguments for (A). I include (C) for completeness but tend to think this is excessively complicated.
[2025-11-08 11:29 AM] Deciusmus: Hrm
[2025-11-08 11:30 AM] Deciusmus: In my game, the distinction between a saytr, a elegant human, a hag, and a half-person / half-bear has been clearly that they are all one species. I also had harpies and redcaps, but they were both "creature servants" although clearly fey
[2025-11-08 11:30 AM] Deciusmus: But fairies have not come up
[2025-11-08 11:31 AM] Deciusmus: So I am not sure I have a strong opinion between A and B but I'd be against C
[2025-11-08 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus: i have used fairy type fey a few times and generally have played them as fairly different in vibe from the "standard fey" archetype -- most significantly in the seeker solo prequel where seeker met a bunch of pixies who were obviously apart from the fey court of the realm
[2025-11-08 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus: which is why i lean a bit towards (B)
[2025-11-08 11:34 AM] Deciusmus: I can see B making sense. It gives a distinct place for things like brownies as well
[2025-11-08 11:34 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah, okay. i think i'll write that into the description i'm working on
[2025-11-08 11:34 AM] Deciusmus: (where brownies would be of the same speices as pixies / etc)
[2025-11-08 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed first draft of "playable species of taelgar"
[2025-11-08 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus: i broke things into common (human, halfling, dwarf, lizardfolk); uncommon (elf, stoneborn, centaur, kenku); fey; and rare (kobold, plane-touched human, free orc, potentially gnome/goblin if they get developed)
[2025-11-08 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus: logic being the common + uncommon are like the "PHB" species that would usually make sense or could make sense, although "uncommon" implies certain backstory constraints
[2025-11-08 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus: fey provides a lot of flexibility for players who want to play "weird" things
[2025-11-08 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus: rare is usually not appropriate for campaigns but provides some ideas for more unusual things
[2025-11-08 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the only real shift is moving centaur + kenku into the "standard packge" (albeit uncommon). given how often people want to play kenku i felt that made sense.
[2025-11-08 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus: probably going to work on mechanics a bit now before turning back to the character encyclopedia pages
[2025-11-08 12:40 PM] Deciusmus: Basic thinking of Zimkova:
![[../_discord_assets/image-E8814.png]]
[2025-11-08 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: 1 = Breva "the land between two rivers" bordered by Volta and Teft, heavily forested, fairly traditional part of Zimka. Lots of little forified villages, a monarch of sorts who mostly organizes the "forest guard"
    2 = north Zimkova = totally unorganized, lightly populated, no monarches, taxes, etc - but lots of little traditional villages along the volta in particular. heartland of kestavo
    3 = Great Chasm = not really any people here, seen as taboo by Breva and north Zimkova for sure
    4 = Lavnoch. bordered on the north by a spur of high peaks - crossable but not in winter, isolating the green circle and on the south by the Semb (although the southern border with Ardlas might be contested, or not really a border, or something)
    5 = Ardlas = richest of the zimkova region. May not have a clear border with Lavnoch, might be more of a continuum
[2025-11-08 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: Basic logic is that there are three "cultural" regions:
    * the north, almost pure kestavo, little sembara influence, centered around Volta headwaters (=2)
    * Breva, with a bit of a unique culture, definite sembaran influence but still primarily kestavo, has a ruler who maintains the riverguard and the forestguard or something like that (=1), plus with some odd stuff on the western border, where access to the Chasm is easiest
    * the south (=4 and 5) Ardlas and Lavoch. Actually fairly isolated from the north, by the mountain spur circled in green and the dense unpopulated woods between Lavnoch and Breva. Mos Numena is mostly worshipped here, although with a few kestavo here and there. Much much more Sembaran than Breva or the north, and with potentially interesting or complicated politics. Definitely allied with dwarves
[2025-11-08 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus: i like it
[2025-11-08 12:49 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is possible that the Braienburn (the hills west of Arnsbury) should extend north-east more clearly to make Breva a bit more isolated from Sembara
[2025-11-08 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: And the narrative history of the highland kingdoms propbably changes - Breva is probably like Vostok, never really "ruled" by Sembara, but with the monarch aligning with Derik III during the great war
[2025-11-08 12:51 PM] Deciusmus: Ardlas and Lavnoch probably are ruled by Sembara, and might tie into some ideas about western Sembara, i.e. where there was a pass through the mountains and potentially a western barony that was wealthy. 
    
    I actually think western Sembara and Ardlas and Lavnoch were badly impacted by the great war in ways we haven't really explored
[2025-11-08 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah agreed
[2025-11-08 01:09 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed some updates along these lines
[2025-11-08 03:40 PM] rsulfuratus: anythign with status/check/mike in species is now open for review
[2025-11-08 03:46 PM] Deciusmus: what do you think of this for the army of tyrwingha:
    
    The Company of the Twilight Veil =>` warlocks
    The Company of Colors =>` riven controlled knights, usually fey touched
    The Iron Company or the Company of Burnished Iron =>` reg soliders
[2025-11-08 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: kenku just trails off on the player page
[2025-11-08 03:54 PM] rsulfuratus: i like the basic vibe. what about the Color Guard, the Twilight Guarrd, and the Iron Guard?
[2025-11-08 03:54 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I like that better
[2025-11-08 03:54 PM] rsulfuratus: re: kenku - yeah need to figure out what to say about them. their lore is kinda scattered
[2025-11-08 05:16 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a bunch of Tyrwingha updates, mostly to the rivers and the army of mostreve
[2025-11-08 05:21 PM] rsulfuratus: solidifying species age and unique biology btw. mostly for elder folk - have not gotten to centaurs, kenku, or fey yet. 
    
    elves - already established, tons of worldbuilding
    dwarves - heart of the mountain rite to become an adult around 25/30; can live to ~350; fertility extremely low so many dwarves have widely spaced families (siblings a decade apart)
    stoneborn - born from stone in some unspecified magical way. age of maturity around 25/30, like dwarves; metabolism slows as they age and they become more stonelike. elder stoneborn (>`200 or so) become more and more statue-like. not clear if they can die of old age, or if they just turn back into stone
    lizardfolk - same youth as humans, reach old age same time as humans roughly, but have very extended old age; elder dominated society; concious control of reproduction by community in some unspecified way
    halflings - basically humans
[2025-11-08 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: (I am about to start running Charli's D&D game, so might be not that responsive. But they spend a LOT of time being silly, so will probably see stuff during the game)
[2025-11-08 05:22 PM] rsulfuratus: my feeling for fey is they don't age, but they cannot spend more than roughly a human lifespan on the material plane or they just kind of fade away. in the feywild not clear what happens
[2025-11-08 05:23 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure there should be a single or canonical answer for fey lifespans
[2025-11-08 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2025-11-08 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: "it various" is probably a good answer. at least some fey don't appear to age though
[2025-11-08 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: Yes for sure.
