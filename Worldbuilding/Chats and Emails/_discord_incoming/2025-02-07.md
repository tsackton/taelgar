# Discord DM – 2025-02-07

[2025-02-07 11:34 AM] Deciusmus: I've been playing with GPT 4o (which I get about 20 minutes free a day on the free plan) and you are right it is way more creative than older chat gpts
[2025-02-07 11:35 AM] Deciusmus: I'm home sick today but feeling better than I was yesterday so I am working on taelgar stuff a bit
[2025-02-07 11:35 AM] Deciusmus: mostly session prep stuff, as I have a game on Sunday; but I'm also working on my March session prep, which is where the question about Umdikza comes from
[2025-02-07 11:57 AM] Deciusmus: Anyway the point being if you do have any thoughts or feelings would be useful to share if you have a moment
[2025-02-07 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus: i have actually had to work the past couple of days as i didn't work much earlier this week as i was behind on session prep; i also have been messing with roll20 to improve automation to make combat run faster (wrote an API script to automatically prompt concentration checks on damage, for example)
[2025-02-07 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus: but i should have a bit of time later this afternoon
[2025-02-07 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus: re: Umdikza, I haven't really thought much about the three despairs. actually despite having a fair bit of notes on undead (many of which are in the undead note or in the various fate of souls / land of the dead / funerary tradition notes), i'm not sure there is much, or any, canonical lore that exists about Umdikza, except perhaps whatever you invented for your Ausson's Crossing game
[2025-02-07 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm actually not sure that the basic framework of the Void Mind ->` Three Despairs ->` Embodied Gods necessarily makes sense and it honestly has not come up in lore. Jinnik keeps getting treated as an embodied god (e.g., see the Pandemonium note), and Thark of course is an embodied god
[2025-02-07 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus: the Void Mind clearly is a useful game contstruct to generate evil gods while overall keeping the Divine Presence essentially god aligned (and is in some respects a replacement for the Tokien-derived Melkor/etc in high school)
[2025-02-07 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus: as its now been almost 5 years of running games in "modern" Taelgar (longer if you count the non-canonical early Plaguelands campaign), i'm increasingly inclined to drop metaphysical concepts that were invented early on but have never impacted in-game lore
[2025-02-07 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus: that said: I think there is some value in having some kind of god-like entity that somehow makes the transition to the land of the dead / the journey through the land of the dead dangerous
[2025-02-07 12:54 PM] Deciusmus: in the aussons crossing game I ended up not reall using a connection to the "void mind" per se
[2025-02-07 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: otherwise, why all the focus on rituals to protect the dead and why the gidari to guard the land of the dead and all taht
[2025-02-07 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus: some of it could be demons and devils but that doesn't feel like the complete answer, and that can't explain the perceived dangers of getting lost on the material plane afte death before reaching the land of the dead in the first place
[2025-02-07 12:56 PM] Deciusmus: the only thing that came up in game was a abberation that had appeared in the old dwarven mines and was ultimately trying to grow large and strong enough to "fully break free"
[2025-02-07 12:56 PM] Deciusmus: I was originally thinking it was somehow related to one of the Three Despairs but ultimately it never came up in game and the whole metaphysics actually works better for it to have been some Far Realms interusion
[2025-02-07 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-02-07 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus: more brainstorming: another observation is that undead are more common in places of traumatic death, and especially lots of traumatic death. e.g., all the plague-affected places (kharsan, drankor); the zombies in sembara tending to rise (at least in part) from old battlefields; just general D&D/adventure planning usefulness
[2025-02-07 01:00 PM] rsulfuratus: so, i think that suggests:
    the transition a soul makes from the material plane to the land of the dead in some way opens an extraplanar portal. this allows the soul to depart, but also, sometimes, allow something else to sneak in
[2025-02-07 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: Umdikza is that something else. their exact origins can be totally mysterious (in game and out of game), although in some way derived from the void mind, most likely (as opposed to e.g. demon lords that likely arise from humanity's worst impulses via the divine spark)
[2025-02-07 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it is useful to keep the vibe of umdikza and jinnik separate from the vibe of thark
[2025-02-07 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: umdikza and jinnik are more like malevolent forces
[2025-02-07 01:03 PM] rsulfuratus: jinnik canonically "lives" in pandemonium, but one interpretation of that is jinnik **is** pandemonium
[2025-02-07 01:04 PM] Deciusmus: Right so is the suggestion to just get rid of the "Three Despairs" as a concept, and instead have
    (a) the Void Mind
    (b) these mysterious "bad things" created by it which canonically include Thark, the Mad One (perhaps retconned to be the same as Jinnick), and Umdikza but which don;t have canonical creation stories
    (c) further "bad things" can be invented as needed (but cautiously, there shouldn't be more than probably 4-5 total)
[2025-02-07 01:04 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-02-07 01:04 PM] Deciusmus: metaphysically thark is more like an embodied god and jinnik and umdizka are more like mos numena archtype gods
[2025-02-07 01:04 PM] Deciusmus: but why that is is undefined
[2025-02-07 01:05 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. and i agree that probably 4-6 or so is the right number
[2025-02-07 01:06 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean if you look at basic monster types there is not that much left to explain after thark (orcs), jinnik (lycanthropes), umdizka (undead), plus all the other stuff that's been invented
[2025-02-07 01:06 PM] rsulfuratus: to the extent that there is a need for an "outer plane of endless war" that can already be thark's domain
[2025-02-07 01:08 PM] rsulfuratus: nine hells and abyss already exist and have origin stories not fully developed but not connected to the void mind
[2025-02-07 01:08 PM] Deciusmus: my actual goal is that
    (a) the next adventure in cleenseau is that the PCs are going to be sent to find one piece of the lich's phylactery (he has hidden 3 pieces around)
    (b) I have established that the phylactery is hidden in a creepy old ruin in the wilderness
    (c) there could be lots of sources for "creepy old ruin" but I was thinking an abandoned cult temple to Umdizka might be interesting (or some other "evil" temple)
    (d) that requires some thought about WHY there would be a cult temple associated with Umdizka and what that would mean, although the details can be a bit vague given it was long abandoned
[2025-02-07 01:09 PM] rsulfuratus: so one thing i was thinking about is that you could think of necromancy magic as arising from two very different sources
[2025-02-07 01:10 PM] rsulfuratus: (1) 'traditional arcane magic' can animate a body, just like it can animate a ladder or a rock. but it can't create an ensouled undead
[2025-02-07 01:10 PM] Deciusmus: (the theory behind umdizka was that malach knew about this because he found some key to being a lich here)
[2025-02-07 01:10 PM] Deciusmus: (but I'm not really sure umdizka is the right source here, actually - although I like the changes above about simplifying the void mind metaphysyics)
[2025-02-07 01:10 PM] rsulfuratus: this kind of magic, while probably perceived as largely evil, might not be irredemmibly evil and you could image a society where this is kind of normal, you have skeleton minions, etc
[2025-02-07 01:11 PM] rsulfuratus: (2) 'undead soul magic' or whatever you want to call it is much more about how to break the bonds between a soul and the land of the dead or whatever, some complex metaphysics that stop the inevitable pull of the Plane of Creation that ultimately draws all souls to it
[2025-02-07 01:12 PM] rsulfuratus: this magic would probably be irredemably evil, and likely would be somehow associated with umdizka
[2025-02-07 01:12 PM] rsulfuratus: a lot of the details and rituals around binding a soul to the material plane theorectically overlap the details and rituals of constructing a phylactery
[2025-02-07 01:13 PM] rsulfuratus: so there could be natural connection between the headquarters of a cult of necromancers and a lich
[2025-02-07 01:17 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, a cult of necromancers could work; I like all the metaphysics there
[2025-02-07 01:27 PM] Deciusmus: so how do you think this works with those metaphysics:
    
    Malach, in his quest to discover the true nature of souls and life and death founded a sanctuary of seers and experimental magicians hidden away in the Cleenseau Wood. They sought to discover  true nature of the Land of the Dead and what exactly the nature of life and death is. In their experiments, they unknowingly drew the attention of Umidzka.
    
    The seers have their souls taken by Umdizka, leaving behind only lifeless eyes, haunted to endlessly watch the sanctuary, and an endless connection to Umdizka, which fills the place with despair and emptiness and a sense of losing the will to live
[2025-02-07 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i think that's fine. i guess i would want to leave the "their souls taken by umdizka" a little vague - as in, if umdizka is the force that creates things like haunts and ghasts and other "lingering signs of death" undead, which are abanonded souls / disconnected from the plane of consciousness / plane of creation, there is a bit of tension with also "consuming" souls
[2025-02-07 02:03 PM] rsulfuratus: but that doesn't mean it can't happen, just the exact metaphysics of why in this case you have soulless husks and in other cases you have disembodied souls should be flexible
[2025-02-07 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: Actually maybe their souls are all still their trapping in their eyes which is all that’s left of them
[2025-02-07 02:05 PM] rsulfuratus: or in this case umdizka consumed their souls as punishment for malach trying (or succeeding) in using umdizka's knowledge/magic/whatever for his own purposes
[2025-02-07 02:05 PM] rsulfuratus: you could imagine metaphysically that umdizka consumse souls starting from the plane of creation side leaving them disembodied and cut off, but this time just kept going and ate the whole thing
[2025-02-07 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: Right I guess that also works. I need to play around a bit with both what long term clues there might be here as well as what the actual in game challenges are going to be
[2025-02-07 02:07 PM] rsulfuratus: i think there are lots of possibilities just the only restriction should be not to devise an explanation/metaphysics/in game clues that conflict with the idea that umdizka is also probably behind "lost souls" and related undead
[2025-02-07 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: When do you think the cloudspinner arc will be over? I’d like to use some of your stuff potentially for my feywild arc which will start either in april or may.
[2025-02-07 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: But I could push it out to June if you cloudspinner arc is going to be long, but I kinda assume not?
[2025-02-07 02:13 PM] rsulfuratus: it is complicated because of Eric's situation as I don't necessarily want him to miss the whole thing but it is hard to predict when he'll feel like playing (and if he is taking a 6 month break we'll just have to do stuff without him)
[2025-02-07 02:14 PM] rsulfuratus: so i haven't really plotted beyond the next session really although i obviously have an arc but it could be 4 sessions or it could be 8 sessions (would be hard to make it longer than that)
[2025-02-07 02:17 PM] Deciusmus: It doesn’t really matter right now - but probably I will make the Malach phylactery 2 sessions instead of 1 and then I’ll need to have a better idea. But that’s April, things should be much clearer with Eric by then. Mostly if you knew it was going to be wrapped up by April no matter what I was going to write the phylactery hunt as one session
[2025-02-07 02:18 PM] Deciusmus: My arc is basically 
    - fight a hag (next session)
    - phylactery 
    - potentially 1-2 sessions of filler
    - feywild arc
[2025-02-07 02:20 PM] Deciusmus: But if I do 2 sessions of filler and 2 sessions of phylactery that’s July for the feywild arc which I assume would be fine
[2025-02-07 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean assuming that we stick to the pretty constant 2 sessions a month we've had for the past 5 years then i'd expect the cloudspinner arc to end no earlier than mid-April and no later than late May
[2025-02-07 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: Right so I’ll just need to decide in April when I’m working on my May session whether it’s kicking off the feywild arc or is filler
[2025-02-07 02:22 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah both in and out of game should be clearer about when the cloudspinner arc will wrap up by then
