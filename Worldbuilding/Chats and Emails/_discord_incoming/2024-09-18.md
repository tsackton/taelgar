# Discord DM – 2024-09-18

[2024-09-18 08:53 PM] Deciusmus: I'm doing a little notes cleanup and just reading some random scattered things...
    
    For something like the winter market for halflings in Adderfell (which would tie in nicely to Viatela (which doesn't have a good note, itself, but..)
    
    What's the best way to suggest something like that? Change the text and tag status/tim? Just chat in discord?
