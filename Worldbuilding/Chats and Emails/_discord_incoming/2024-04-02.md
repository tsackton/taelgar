# Discord DM – 2024-04-02

[2024-04-02 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: So I introduced this divine soul sorcerer of the Sibyl, who is fascinated by magic and has kicked off a conversation with my PCs about the philosophy of magic (in a play-by-email exchange we are going to do over the next 2ish weeks). 
    
    Do you have any interest in being part of it, either as Tristan (the sorcerer) or Armand? 
    
    There is nothing “game/plot” related it’s just going to be people asking Tristan what he knows about different kinds of magic
[2024-04-02 08:15 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, that seems fun
[2024-04-02 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: Btw, all I have on Tristan is in obsidian. He has some mysterys (i.e. this He grew up in Tyrwingha, in Tafolwern, he says, but in the course of your talking about home, he talks about one of his earliest memories, the birth of Cece I's youngest daughter - which happened 57 years ago).
    
    I was vaguely thinking he spent some time in the feywild, but any explanation you come up with for that, if it comes up, would be fine
