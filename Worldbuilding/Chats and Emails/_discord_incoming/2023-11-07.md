[2023-11-07 10:41 PM] Deciusmus: Two things as I was mucking around for a few minutes with maps + Javascript.
    
    1. On maps, I really like having a map in Obsidian as it helps the worldbuilding a lot to be able to easily reference stuff. Do you have (a) a better map than the one on taelgar verse with (b) layers for political borders or climate? The obsidian leaflet does layers, so if you had a chance to export/push a set of PNGs I might play around
[2023-11-07 10:48 PM] Deciusmus: 2. On whereabouts, I was thinking of simplifying the code generation a little bit, not totally sure the details, but basically trying to simplify a bit for two "common" cases
    * Just a home or just an origin, or a home + origin with no dates
    * a single excursion line, for NPCs where they are "currently" somewhere, but their home/origin are not clear
