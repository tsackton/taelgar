# Discord DM – 2025-10-07

[2025-10-07 10:06 AM] rsulfuratus: ah. nothing canonical. the basic idea I had in mind was that the first of the summer ash storms in 1720 brings with it a horde of chaos elementals, of a similar theme to the kinds of ones you've fought
[2025-10-07 10:06 AM] rsulfuratus: but from there nothing definite
[2025-10-07 10:06 AM] rsulfuratus: from the perspective of a unifying event in the history of the refounded alliance it probably makes sense if the aurbeze basically lose the first campaigns
[2025-10-07 10:07 AM] rsulfuratus: but whether they unify quickly into a united front and turn the tide by the fall, or whether it takes a year and the victory is not until the next summers campaign (or even two summers) is completely undecided
[2025-10-07 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus: the vibe is basically that rai + monks trigger a limbo "high tide" with the failed attempt to close a portal and this is a delayed spillover consequence
[2025-10-07 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus: so it is fought mostly against chaos elementals and other magical creatures - does not involve hobgoblins (iron fang has not figured out how to control chaos metal at this stage so are probably in hiding during limbo high tides)
[2025-10-07 11:41 AM] Deciusmus: Right. So a late summer chaos elemental intrusion into maseau that the PCs go defeat (perhaps because Aurbez is half overrun, hence getting into maseau) could fit nicely
[2025-10-07 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah, that would fit well
[2025-10-07 11:44 AM] Deciusmus: Alternatively I was thinking about a dragon in the mostreve hills. But actually could be a similar idea - the dragon is fleeing north because of the chaos of the limbo high tide
[2025-10-07 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah you could imagine the ashen hoard / chaos elementals displace whatever from the upper istaros valley
