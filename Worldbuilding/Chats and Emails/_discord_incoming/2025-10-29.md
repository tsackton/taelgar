# Discord DM – 2025-10-29

[2025-10-29 09:31 AM] rsulfuratus: so after messing around a lot last night, just some general obervations for posterity. assume that codex and copilot will have similar quirks but not guaranteed:
    
    (1) works incredibly well for filling in stubs and blank staging notes; the templates might need a bit of tweaking here and it probably needs a default item and place template as well to guide it, but generally this is a very strong use case. seems to be able to do large batches very easily, but haven't yet tested on dunmar frontier or worldbuilding staging notes that are a bit more complex at times than addermarch or great library staging notes.
    
    (2) works decently well for extending and reorganizing simple notes, especially when background information is present only in a few session notes / DM notes. e.g., it did a pretty good job reformating and extending the aurbeze NPC notes from the three wells council. needs guidance on what to do with secrets if they exist (but this is not an issue for you). can do this in batches effectively. 
    
    (3) works fairly poorly for reorganizing and extending complex notes (e.g., Vola or Fausto) with many mentions across numerous session notes. this is especially true if attempting to work in batches. best strategy i've found so far is to ask it to make a new "NPC Revised.md" doc with all the information it can find, being as comprehensive as possible, and then manually organize and clean. this is better as a one off for each note - the more you ask it to do at once the worse each individual note is.
[2025-10-29 09:32 AM] rsulfuratus: as an aside - it is extremely good at finding conflicts across notes. another good use besides filling in stubs/staging notes might be continuity conflict detection.
[2025-10-29 09:33 AM] rsulfuratus: but i haven't tested this extensively
