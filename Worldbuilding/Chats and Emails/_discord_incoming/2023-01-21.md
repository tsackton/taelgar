[2023-01-21 08:28 AM] rsulfuratus: push *UNTESTED* version of python code to handle home values and conversion of strings to links. going to be busy through midafternoon but will hopefully be able to test/debug later today. however should work fine for note without a home dview function
[2023-01-21 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: python export should be working now
[2023-01-21 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: may fail if you have multiple homes w/o dates, also needs testing on windows for path operations
[2023-01-21 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: I'll try it out later tonight or tomorrow
