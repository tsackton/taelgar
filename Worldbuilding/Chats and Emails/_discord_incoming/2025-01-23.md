# Discord DM – 2025-01-23

[2025-01-23 12:38 PM] Deciusmus: For history since the downfall I think that might make sense. For something like the Riving or the pre Riving time or the Downfall itself, the cosmology style is probably better
[2025-01-23 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus: just pushed a rewrite/update of regions in taelgar
[2025-01-23 01:05 PM] Deciusmus: I'm reading that. I think you are right that moving Vostok + Cymean to Western Green Sea would make sense; I also think you wanted Cymea to be somewhat intentionally blank? to preserve for a potential future campaign or miniseries?
    
    It feels like the kind of place that should be developed for a larger purpose than "passing through?
[2025-01-23 01:18 PM] Deciusmus: I wonder if it would make more sense to consider:
    
    (a)
![[../_discord_assets/image-37B3D.png]]
[2025-01-23 01:20 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. #1 - Greater Dunmar, basically the dunarmi basin + Myrani Gap up to the Kharia
    #2 Istaros River Valley, extending as far south as Drankor/Desoluation Around Drankor
    #3 "Eastern Drankor" basically the area south of the east branch of the Mahar
    #4 "South Cymea" basically east branch of Mahar north to the Cymean mountains
[2025-01-23 01:20 PM] Deciusmus: Or even actually whether it would make more sense to get rid pf #4 and add it to Western Green Sea
[2025-01-23 01:21 PM] Deciusmus: The border is unclear, but I think it is canonical that there is basically some line that divides the plagueland from "remaining human civilization"  on the shores of the western green sea, and south cymea + cymea are good to at least somewhat treat together
[2025-01-23 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm in meetings until at least 2:30, but have a quick break between meeting 1 and meeting 2.  but a few quick thoughts:
    
    (1) i think probably the undeveloped southern regions (south of the Shrev) fit better with 5 than with Greater Dunmar
    (2) i'm not sure that 5 and 6 need to exist separately?
    (3) Greater Dunmar should probably extend to the Mahar since historically e.g. Kharsan and other regions are central Dunmar; this also tracks basically the regions Dunmar Frontier traveled in. dividing like with 5/6 is "south of Xurkhaz, basically along the border of what is actively mapped. this distinguishes the Nashtkar, which is more rocky, from the high desert plateau of the Garamjala
    (4) south cymea does probably make sense to consider as part of Western Green Sea
    
    this however, leaves the plaguelands as basically its own region. maybe that should be merged with greater sembara? unclear to me
[2025-01-23 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: re: Cymea yes I think you are right, I had said something like that in the past (worth saving for an actual campaign to develop in detail)
[2025-01-23 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: I have a meeting in a few min but I'll dump a proposed restructure here based on the above
[2025-01-23 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: my meetting is a bit pointless so I am drawing region lines..... a few questions
    
    Where does vostok go? options
    
    1. All of Vostok in Greater Sembara
    2. All of Vostok in West Green Sea
    3. North Vostok in Greater Sembara, South Vostok in West Green Sea
    4. North Vostok in "Ursk", South Vostok in West Green Sea
    5. Noth Vostok in Ursk, South Vostok in Greaer Sembara
[2025-01-23 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: (my vote is 4, for what it is worth, or maybe 2 or 3)
[2025-01-23 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: Question 2:
    Irrla - east or west Green Sea ( I vote east, but am pretty undecided)
[2025-01-23 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: Question 3:
    Cymea - all in west green sea? or is western cymea in Greater Sembara?
[2025-01-23 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: I don't think 4. the svinjo mountains are a pretty sharp dividing line
[2025-01-23 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: are they? the in-game vibe I got was that the Vimfrost events and giants and whatnot had a non-trivial impact on this region:
![[../_discord_assets/image-8254D.png]]
[2025-01-23 02:48 PM] Deciusmus: they are obviously a significant barrier in game, but from an "invention" standpoint is that yellow highlighted area more connected to the Vargaldi/white dragons/etc or to the Zimka?
[2025-01-23 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: although maybe actually something like this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-CB762.png]]
[2025-01-23 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: S = part of sembara
    U = "ursk" region, but actually perhaps a canonically "blank" area
    W = part of west green sea
[2025-01-23 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: which might align pretty well with 
    S = canonically "Zimka-influenced"
    U = canonically blank: could be Zimka, could be brand new, might be related to the Vargaldi, etc
    W = Skaer/Tollen/mariner
[2025-01-23 02:55 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that northern part of Vostok is such a blank slate it is not straightforward to put it in a region. Vimfrost also impacts Sembara, of course
[2025-01-23 02:55 PM] rsulfuratus: Vimfrost's War is kind of an opening gambit in the Great War
[2025-01-23 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: but my sense is that the people on the east of the mountains are not generally putting themselves subservient to giants in order to gain protection from dragons
[2025-01-23 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`west of the mountains
[2025-01-23 02:57 PM] Deciusmus: Right that is true;
[2025-01-23 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess ultimately I'd put Vostok and Tollen in Sembara, and have the dividing line for Sembara vs Western Green Sea basically be the straights of Cymea. Vostok is not generally a mariner culture so they look more inward anyway
[2025-01-23 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: Western Green Sea then should be Skaer and Cymea
[2025-01-23 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: Ok, that works
[2025-01-23 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: I'd put all of Cymea (west, "main", south) in Western Green Sea, even though it introduces some cross-region development w/r/t Tollen
[2025-01-23 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: right, which is fine, the goal of regions is really mostly to organize where blank spots are and such not to erect walls
[2025-01-23 03:00 PM] rsulfuratus: with this stuff moved to western green sea, i'd move irrla to eastern green sea. i think it works as the western edge of the "east" more than the eastern edge of the "west", if that makes sense
[2025-01-23 03:01 PM] rsulfuratus: that still leaves the plaguelands isolated as the only thing in a region that is basically the upper istaros. although perhaps orenlas fits in the upper istaros. actually, you could move xurkhaz to the upper istaros as well
[2025-01-23 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: so sembara basically this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-DF90C.png]]
[2025-01-23 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-01-23 03:04 PM] rsulfuratus: although i'd put the darkwood in sembara, it is much more closely tied to addermarch than the plaguelands
[2025-01-23 03:06 PM] rsulfuratus: obviously the line between the upper istaros and the western green sea is pretty vague because nothing is invented in south cymea, but i think find to leave that vague, but include the "undeveloped historical insingue area" in upper istaros and the "undeveloped historical drankorian providence of South Cymea" in western green sea
[2025-01-23 03:46 PM] Deciusmus: another question:
![[../_discord_assets/image-D1385.png]]
[2025-01-23 03:46 PM] Deciusmus: where is the line between "Dunmar basin" and "Ruins of Drankor"?
[2025-01-23 03:47 PM] Deciusmus: is it more like the red or the black or something lese?
![[../_discord_assets/image-61461.png]]
[2025-01-23 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: 2nd is the dunmari north-western border more like red/blue/black or something lese?
![[../_discord_assets/image-73433.png]]
[2025-01-23 03:50 PM] Deciusmus: finally should the Chardon vs Nevos/Apporia line be the green one along south chardon area, or more like the yellow one here?
![[../_discord_assets/image-D2BA8.png]]
[2025-01-23 04:27 PM] rsulfuratus: I think this is roughly what I'd do
![[../_discord_assets/image-657EB.png]]
[2025-01-23 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: where c = chardon?
[2025-01-23 04:28 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-01-23 04:29 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the Yeraad river valley is definitively not Nevos culturally, and better to keep the river together. the highlands towards Dunmar (south of the mountains) are Nevos; dividing line between Nevos/Dunmar is arbitrary - Darba was at one point Illorian, after all. the mountains should all be Chardon
[2025-01-23 04:30 PM] rsulfuratus: the canal is clearly chardonian now, but the area is more nevos in culture. exact dividing line south of chardon TBD since that area is not invented. but for sure the canal should be nevos
[2025-01-23 04:31 PM] rsulfuratus: to the south, basically the "high desert" should be outside greater dunmar, with the line running Xurkhaz east to Kharja, then south, cutting across the southern edge of the Hara River Gorge (the only outflow from the DUnmari Basin), then across Yuvanti to the line of the Shrev. this splits historical dunmar a bit but makes a good dividing line in the present between "dunmar-ish" and "true desolation"
[2025-01-23 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: Last question is this the right dividing line between "ursk-ish" and far north/eastern green sea?
![[../_discord_assets/image-14681.png]]
[2025-01-23 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: with the cavaet that the line between "Eastern green sea" and "Far north" is actually totally arbitrary since this whole "far northeast" region is completely blank
[2025-01-23 04:35 PM] rsulfuratus: i'd put it along the ket (river that goes west from Zvervinka). that is basically the northern edge of Vargaldi territory and kind of marks "here be dragons beyond"
[2025-01-23 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: never decided what, if anything, should be in the blank space just north of zvervinka. probably that is "eastern green sea" (just extend the green line you have now to meet the ket)
[2025-01-23 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: and the part of the map that is drawn with boreal forest north of the ket is "far north"
[2025-01-23 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: I plan to have a couple of dashed lines to indicate "totally arbitrary"
[2025-01-23 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: would it make sense to split Mawar into a region with the rest of the "North Bay" ? it feels like development of the north bay region makes the most sense as part of a renewed interest in mawer
[2025-01-23 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. something like:
![[../_discord_assets/image-062DE.png]]
[2025-01-23 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: M= Mawar
    C = Chardon
    NS = north sentinenls
    S = sentinels
[2025-01-23 04:59 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, although actually this is all going to be reshuffled shortly due to the ongoing events in Chardon. there is actually an argumen that the Chardon region should really end at the northern extent of the Drankorian Empire, and that Voltara, Mawar, and the North Bay should be one region. Chardon would be the northern shore of lake valandros, nothwest along the southern edge of tawir forest, then along the mawar boundry mountains
[2025-01-23 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: for meta-game reasons, development in the north (voltara and surroundings) have proceded largely without much consideration of the south, except the chalyte trade links them
[2025-01-23 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: and lake valandros remains a big blank spot
[2025-01-23 05:00 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-3963E.png]]
[2025-01-23 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: and then something like this for Mawar + the North?
![[../_discord_assets/image-5C877.png]]
[2025-01-23 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. although now I'm reconsidered whether the chardon line shouldn't include north apporia, basically a line from the southern end of the canal through the two hills to the coast
[2025-01-23 05:04 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not sure it matters too much either way. there are always going to be boundary regions
[2025-01-23 05:05 PM] Deciusmus: the advantage of moving it is it makes the canonical vs non-canonical clearer, i.e. it is a "canon exists north of here" line
[2025-01-23 05:06 PM] Deciusmus: but of course as new things are made up those lines will always shift
[2025-01-23 05:06 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that is a good argument
[2025-01-23 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: i think i'd shift it
[2025-01-23 05:07 PM] Deciusmus: here's what I have
![[../_discord_assets/Taelgar_Map_Full-F09A3.png]]
[2025-01-23 05:08 PM] Deciusmus: green dotted lines are "this area is so poorly defined the regional boundaries are not clear"
[2025-01-23 05:10 PM] Deciusmus: I'll move Chardon/Nevos, any other feedback? otherwise I'm going to number them and update the region map in obsidian
[2025-01-23 05:14 PM] rsulfuratus: i'd move the upper istaros / Drankor ruins / western green sea line down to the Istaros tributary that comes from the eastern border mountains.
    
    south of tributary is Drankor ruins, north is upper istaros (west/inland) or western green sea (east/coast). the border mountains south of the river are Drankor ruins, north of the river are western green sea.
    
    reason is simply for ease of description, for the most part, and also because my feeling is that currently the desolation of cha'mutte is a little big and the south cymean world could reasonably expand into the mountains, but probably not too far south of that istaros tributary. but doesn't matter too much as that is obviously an unsettled border
[2025-01-23 05:16 PM] rsulfuratus: for settled borders i'd push the northern border of the north sentinels up about 4-5 hexes, so it captures all of pandar, which extends for maybe 200 miles north of the mountain line just north of the forest of nightmares, or just make it dotted until the northern border of pandar is settled
[2025-01-23 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: otherwise looks great
[2025-01-23 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: i can import as a layer to the photoshop file at some point (unless you are doing this in photoshop already)
[2025-01-23 05:18 PM] Deciusmus: I am doing this in photoshop but I'm scared to do it in the real map because I don't know what I am doing 🙂
[2025-01-23 05:22 PM] rsulfuratus: i think I locked everything on the map, so you can't really edit the existing image (except I think text, which is easy to fix if it gets messed up)
[2025-01-23 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: I added a new layer (borders ->` region borders), if you just make sure that layer is selected you can draw on it and it should be fine. or you should be able to copy-paste your existing layer to the new file
[2025-01-23 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: plus I have a backup copy of the map that isn't shared
[2025-01-23 05:24 PM] Deciusmus: you need to close it for me to open
[2025-01-23 05:24 PM] rsulfuratus: done
[2025-01-23 06:00 PM] Deciusmus: ok if I didn't screw anything up the layer should be saved in the main map
[2025-01-23 10:13 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a branch, new-region-format where I was playing around with changing up the regions in the Gazetteer to align with the regions we defined earlier and moving the intro text we have about each region to the region landing page
[2025-01-23 10:13 PM] Deciusmus: curious what you think if you get a chance to look
[2025-01-23 10:14 PM] Deciusmus: I've only really done the Far North and a bit of North Sentinels
[2025-01-23 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus: it is very appealing. the only issue is it become a bit unclear what to do with:
    (a) geographic features that are larger than a single region, such as the Sentinels
    (b) realms or other cultural/political pages that span multiple features
[2025-01-23 10:33 PM] Deciusmus: For realms, they mostly all fit in a single region, right?
[2025-01-23 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: i think (b) could be finessed by putting things in the most sensible place, but it kind of breaks the idea that there is only one chain of whereabouts. 
    
    e.g., Voltara ->` city in the Chardonian Empire ->` realm in the Chardonian Central region
    
    (but Voltara is actually in the north region)
[2025-01-23 10:34 PM] Deciusmus: I guess the Chardonian empire
[2025-01-23 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus: Chardonian Empire is most significant region-spanning political unit. But also something like western Cymea is functionally a Tollen colony in many ways, but is in a different region. And parts of coastal Vostok are controlled by the Skaer, but are in a different region
[2025-01-23 10:36 PM] Deciusmus: right it gets back to our conversation a long time ago about "part of" geographically vs "part of" politically
[2025-01-23 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, although i think that could be finessed in various ways. 
    
    river systems are worse because many of them span 2+ regions and it is tricky to break them up
[2025-01-23 10:37 PM] Deciusmus: (on the Sentinels, I think it is fine to have a couple of pages -- Sentinels, Green Sea) just outside any region
[2025-01-23 10:37 PM] Deciusmus: the river systems are a bit more of a pain
[2025-01-23 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus: i think that conceptually it is fine for things to be in multiple regions, and even from a file organization point of view it wouldn't be too bad. 
    
    but it breaks our whereabouts system
[2025-01-23 10:40 PM] Deciusmus: well, arguably for rivers you actually want them to be in watersheds, which in turn are either in a region or "in taelga"
[2025-01-23 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus: but then you won't put up those in a "list of rivers in XXX region" dataviewjs query, which is the main point of whereabouts
[2025-01-23 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus: i really like the framework of the landing page for each region and having more smaller regions makes it easier to write up good landing pages
[2025-01-23 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus: so i think it is worth playing around with to see if we can make it wokr
[2025-01-23 10:44 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking that Aurbez + Ardonne should really be in the Istaros region
[2025-01-23 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, we've gone back and forth on that a lot. i think it makes sense in the upper istaros
[2025-01-23 10:44 PM] Deciusmus: so actually the only major watersheds that spans regions is 
    (a) the northern + southern Istaros are in two different regions, but also have very different characters
    (b) the Chasa-Nadhi and Yeerad river systems in Chardon
[2025-01-23 10:45 PM] Deciusmus: the problem is that whereas on the east/sembara land the big dividing line is rivers or mountains, in the chardon world it is forests and distance
[2025-01-23 10:45 PM] Deciusmus: so the geography aligns itself with the politcal and river systems in sembara better than in the west coast
[2025-01-23 10:46 PM] rsulfuratus: sembara also doesn't really have any long rivers
[2025-01-23 10:46 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, its kinda hemmed in with the mostreve hills and the mountains and the ocean
[2025-01-23 10:46 PM] rsulfuratus: the longest river that flows into the green sea that is mapped is the ket, which is conveniently a border of a region
[2025-01-23 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus: whereas on the west coast the chasa-nahadi is actually spilt across 4 regions if you count all tributaries
[2025-01-23 10:48 PM] rsulfuratus: and the istaros across 3
[2025-01-23 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus: i think that the ultimate solution would potentially be a partOf relationship for places
[2025-01-23 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus: then you could break up pages for big geographic features into multiple smaller pages (upper istaros, lower istaros), but have them all connected as partOf: Istaros Watershed
[2025-01-23 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus: so that you'd have whereabouts trace a unique path from most specific to least specific that should always end in a region
[2025-01-23 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus: and then big features could have their own pages that span regions (we'd need a good file organization so you don't end up with lots of loose pages)
[2025-01-23 10:52 PM] rsulfuratus: mostly, this would be used for:
    (a) all rivers, that should always be part of a watershed, unless they are the only named river
    (b) mountain chains that span regions (I think only the sentinels)
[2025-01-23 10:52 PM] Deciusmus: Hrm…
[2025-01-23 10:52 PM] rsulfuratus: big political units could get the same treatment
[2025-01-23 10:53 PM] Deciusmus: The other thought I had is home vs origin whereabouts might “just work”
[2025-01-23 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not sure I get that
[2025-01-23 10:54 PM] Deciusmus: Um, one sec
[2025-01-23 10:56 PM] Deciusmus: So the whereabouts concept already has the ability to have multiple whereabouts
[2025-01-23 10:57 PM] Deciusmus: And different display text for different lines in the bio block
[2025-01-23 10:57 PM] Deciusmus: And the dataview queries already have the concept of querying for:
    - in a region 
    - in or from a region
    
    (And would be trivial to extent a bit as needed)
[2025-01-23 10:58 PM] rsulfuratus: so i guess for rivers or mountain chains the idea could be "origin" = "partOf" and "home" = "region" (or vice versa)?
[2025-01-23 10:59 PM] Deciusmus: so if the convention is:
    - origin location is always the watershed/mountain range
    - home location is the region
    - political unit is the “current”
[2025-01-23 11:02 PM] Deciusmus: Then you could have different types of queries on different pages. Because the all merge nicely if they are the same it should be possible to have say:
    
    some river near voltara
    - origin: Chasa-Nedhi watershed
    - home: northwest coast
    - current: northern frontier of chardon 
    
    Then the Chardonian empire page would show everything currently in, the Northwest Coast would show everything based in (home) and the watershed page would show everything from (origin)
[2025-01-23 11:03 PM] rsulfuratus: that is pretty nice, actually. it might be worth updating the whereabouts code to accept some synonyms for home and away to make this a little bit clearer
[2025-01-23 11:04 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess one problem is it doesn't allow origin to change, but realistically that should probably never change. but it might actually be better to swap that so the region is the origin, and home is the watershed etc
[2025-01-23 11:04 PM] Deciusmus: If some other river in say sembara doesn’t set anything but “whereabouts: sembara” all the queries still work because the whereabouts code knows that a single whereabout is home + origin + current
[2025-01-23 11:04 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah. Anyway I gotta go to bed. Might play a little bit in the branch tomorrow
[2025-01-23 11:05 PM] Deciusmus: I like the idea of synonyms
[2025-01-23 11:05 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i am about to go to bed too. i think the basic idea of just overloading whereabouts is clever though and probably the right solution
[2025-01-23 11:06 PM] rsulfuratus: if we ues home for "watershed" you can even have the watershed of the Hara change pre and post Great War (if in fact the hara is now cut off from the Isatros), and things like that
[2025-01-23 11:06 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway, definitely worth fiddling with. i'm not doing any work on gazetteer pages for a while so good to mess around in a branch
[2025-01-23 11:06 PM] rsulfuratus: going to bed now
[2025-01-23 11:16 PM] rsulfuratus: Thinking while brushing my teeth. You might want something like (would need to double check code so these may be incorrect):
    - type region: short hand for type home, end date 1 (so always set as origin and never home, even if home is absent)
    - type: subunit (or something) short hand for type: away, start: 1, end: 9999 (unless start or end are specified in which case use those), so always current location (home or origin would never be current location if they are different from away, I think)
    - partof: synonym for home but doesn’t set dates to anything in particular (shouldn’t be necessary I don’t think)
