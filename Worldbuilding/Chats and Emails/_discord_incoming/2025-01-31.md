# Discord DM – 2025-01-31

[2025-01-31 09:35 AM] rsulfuratus: to the extent to which i have time today (might be a lot - very few meetings so unless i get a bunch of email to deal with a pretty light day), i'm working on fleshing out some backgorund notes, primarily two new notes i moved from brainstorming:
    - hobgoblin movements after cha'mutte
    - west coast history framework
    
    not really starting on a full fledged "Timeline of the West Coast" publishable note yet but instead trying to organize canonical facts vs ideas from long discussion
[2025-01-31 09:35 AM] rsulfuratus: will try to push regularly in case you are doing any taelgar stuff today
[2025-01-31 01:33 PM] rsulfuratus: fyi i have a copy of the map where the region boundaries layer is not mesed up with the west coast history lines. can restore to that if it is too much of a hassle to carefullly erase the west coast stuff from the region boundaries
[2025-01-31 01:39 PM] Deciusmus: I fixed it
[2025-01-31 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: Should just lock the region borders layer so you cant accidentally draw on it
[2025-01-31 01:51 PM] Deciusmus: are you actively working on anything? I have about 20 minutes and I was thinking of trying to write a bit more of the hobgoblin movements
[2025-01-31 01:57 PM] rsulfuratus: No should have pushed everything
[2025-01-31 04:20 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a few small updates to the hobgoblin movements page
[2025-01-31 04:20 PM] Deciusmus: and my WIP Greater Chardon gazetteer main page
[2025-01-31 04:34 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a draft of the west coast history framework note
[2025-01-31 04:34 PM] rsulfuratus: can use clean up but should be roughly complete, pending some open questions (which could be better highlighted)
[2025-01-31 04:43 PM] rsulfuratus: looking at your questions. 
    
    i think the mawar renaissance works quite well if you think about the Chardonian conquest north as a ~80 year process from 1600-1680 that involved a ton of resources and manpower
[2025-01-31 04:43 PM] rsulfuratus: mawar emerges with the defeat of "central evil realm"
[2025-01-31 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: chardon is spending all its energy slowly conquering north
[2025-01-31 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: so mawar controls the seas and trade more or less
[2025-01-31 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: possibly they help in some ways - maybe there is a joint mawar/chardon naval battle that destroys the hobgoblin navy at one point
[2025-01-31 04:45 PM] rsulfuratus: basically chardon is spain here, which doesn't emerge as a major mercantile power till after the reconquista
[2025-01-31 04:51 PM] Deciusmus: right, I guess I'm not totally sure why it takes ~2-3 generations to drive out the hobgoblins. But I guess plenty of medieval warfare is slow with lots of stalemates and slow advances and consolidation of gains and whatnot
[2025-01-31 04:51 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean the reconquista was like 700 years wasn't it?
[2025-01-31 05:00 PM] Deciusmus: yeah although a lot of fits and starts
[2025-01-31 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: partly i'm envisioning that this is not one great hobgoblin kingdom fielding a single massive army for a decivise battle against Chardon. it is maybe 10 smaller hobgoblin kingdoms, in a shifting series of alliances
[2025-01-31 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: so you have a bunch of fits and starts and shifting terrain
[2025-01-31 05:00 PM] Deciusmus: and just as many alliances between a little christian kingdom and a muslim one has christian vs muslim
[2025-01-31 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: more like the 100 years war than the reconquista
[2025-01-31 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: I guess I'm trying to figure out the vibe of a slow reconquest against hobgoblins, i.e. how "evil" are they?
[2025-01-31 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: are the chardonians sometimes allying with one group?
[2025-01-31 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: against another?
[2025-01-31 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not sure i like that exactly. but chardon at this point is a new empire and the entire area has seen a generation of war and a lot of death
[2025-01-31 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not against it I just think it is worth considering the impact on psyche/history/etc of a long drawn out push of the hobgoblins out of the terriority
[2025-01-31 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: it is more like, you have a victory but you just don't have the people to fight again
[2025-01-31 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: so there is a lot of fits and starts as chardon works to forge disjointed territory into a functional empire
[2025-01-31 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: Like, more specifically, what makes it take a long time? Does it feel like endless war? Is it more like hobgoblin kingdom X falls but the cost is high and there is a new fortified border, and 10 years of frozen conflict
[2025-01-31 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it is the second
[2025-01-31 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, the rivers are well structured for a sequence of stalemates along these rivers
[2025-01-31 05:04 PM] rsulfuratus: chardon was not a major military power in the great war. they win against the dragons, but basically only because of the elves and some high level magic. possibly the conclave war leaves chardon dangerously exposed as many high level magic users die
[2025-01-31 05:04 PM] rsulfuratus: the shadow armanda is a naval victory and chardon's first kind of "return to power" is as a maritime power
[2025-01-31 05:05 PM] rsulfuratus: i imagine that the 50-80 years of war against hobgoblins is when the now-famous chardonian legion and chardonian battle mages are forged and more-or-less invented / rediscovered
[2025-01-31 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: this would also be the first offensive war chardon fights basically ever; other wars are desperate defenses that end with a skin-of-the-teeth victoy (conclave) or a dramatic victory (shadow)
[2025-01-31 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: right. so it is more like...
    1550s there is a fragile stalemate/peace and chardon is just thankful the hobgoblins don't move farther south because they are not sure they'd survive
    then you get some leader or movement in say 1608 that launches somekind of push, and maybe it succeeds fora bit but then fails and chardon falls back to the old fortified river line.
    and then in 1618 sometime tries again and this time there is a major victory, and some hobgoblin leader is killed, but it takes 5 more years of scrambling to stabilize the newly reclaimed terrority, and then the next kingdom almost overruns them, and so it takes 15 years before anyone tries again
[2025-01-31 05:09 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the pysche of chardon is very much that the 1560-1600 period is kind of a freak out. this is when the society of the open scroll is founded, for example (1561)
[2025-01-31 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: and then in the 1640s the cycle repeats, with victories and then losses, but it is better nd faster
[2025-01-31 05:10 PM] Deciusmus: and then it repeats again only 10 years later, and this time chardon does better, etc
[2025-01-31 05:10 PM] rsulfuratus: right. i think the will is there and i think after the defeat of the shadow armanda there is a lot of popular sentiment in chardon that it is a grave moral failing to leave the people of the north coast suffering under hobgoblin rule (which, although gentle for hobgoblins, is not great)
[2025-01-31 05:11 PM] rsulfuratus: but it takes time for chardon to grow into the ability to win quickly and easily. by the 1670s they probably sweep up the last of the hobgoblins without much trouble
[2025-01-31 05:11 PM] rsulfuratus: the only question then is why don't they get involved in the mindknife war? or if they do, why does mawar suffer so much?
[2025-01-31 05:13 PM] rsulfuratus: it kind of makes me think the mindkinfe war should be something pretty weird, like aberrations emerging from the middle of the peninsula or something
[2025-01-31 05:14 PM] rsulfuratus: and really should probably not last 10 years, it should be a quick devasting war that crushes mawar before they can really even call for help. maybe chardon does help / send aid in the end but the damage is done
[2025-01-31 05:15 PM] rsulfuratus: push it a bit later, so chardon is in its last expansionist phase, and then you have the combination of mawar being wary of invinting the chardonians in as well
[2025-01-31 05:16 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I’ve always envisioned it as coming from either the north or the peninsula itself
[2025-01-31 05:16 PM] Deciusmus: Right like 1682-1685
[2025-01-31 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah
