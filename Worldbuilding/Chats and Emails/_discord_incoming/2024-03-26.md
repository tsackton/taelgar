[2024-03-26 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus: I think status tags are best used only to indicate "there is canon or near-canon information about this page that is not on this page."
[2024-03-26 11:48 AM] Deciusmus: Right so that suggests that, i.e. the Abyss and Gowerbourne should both have empty status tags
[2024-03-26 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah, I think so
[2024-03-26 11:52 AM] Deciusmus: but, if for example, I had introduced a bunch of stuff about Gowerbourne to my players in email, but not yet in obsidian, i'd make it needs work
    
    And if you had a bunch of backstory notes about the Abyss that impacted events in game but were not cleaned up for obisidian, you might set Abyss to "needs work"
    
    And maybe for a page like "Embry" where although I don't have specific facts or notes, the general 'vibe' has come out in game and clearly there should be a couple of sentences before calling it done, I'd add a needswork as well, not to write a long Tollen-style page, but just to have something
[2024-03-26 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah, I've tended to mark things needswork either because I have explicit notes I need to clean up and add, or because I have a sense of the place that isn't well captured in the current text even if I don't have explicit notes
[2024-03-26 11:54 AM] Deciusmus: ok, that's good guidance
[2024-03-26 12:16 PM] Deciusmus: BTW, I've been switching status/unknown to status/tim on pages I didn't write that "look" complete to me but I'm not sure if you have stuff to add
[2024-03-26 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I saw that, cleaning up some of those now
[2024-03-26 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: feel free to give your cleric a permanent magic something and one or three consumables, or if you don't, I might drop a few in
