# Discord DM – 2025-01-24

[2025-01-24 07:50 AM] Deciusmus: I did a quick test before starting work and with one minor tweak it all works. The main question is what do we want the display text to be.
    
    I think it is easiest to use home for region and origin for watershed. Origin is slightly wonkier than other whereabouts so it might be better to use it for the special case.
    
    So my proposal is:
    
    A place that is part of a larger geographic system (rivers, mostly, but some parts of mountain ranges or the green sea as well perhaps) should have an origin location for the part of thing.
    
    All places should have a home location that traces back to the region.
    
    A place that is part of a political unit outside its region (or in its region, if it makes sense to be "part of" two things, i.e. the Copper Hills might be part of Darba Highlands and Dunmar) should have a away line for the political unit
[2025-01-24 07:54 AM] Deciusmus: I'm proposing the following aliases:
    
    region =>` alias for home with no date
    polity =>` alias for away
    watershed =>` alias for home with date 1
    
    (I can't think of a good alias for "geographic feature" and I think it will mostly be used for rivers)
[2025-01-24 07:55 AM] Deciusmus: The bit I'm not sure of is what should the bio block say:
![[../_discord_assets/image-337AE.png]]
[2025-01-24 07:55 AM] Deciusmus: (I know the Yemo'te isn't really part of Chasa-Nahadi, but it was a convinent test page)
[2025-01-24 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus: i mostly have a lot of work today but taking a break for a bit before my next meeting at 11 am. throwing out a few ideas, all just brainstormiing.
    
    (1) the whereabouts framework is very powerful and we've sort of used it to overload a couple of things (creator and owner for items, for example; now partof relationships and regions). so far we've kind of ad hoc used whatever works for overloading, but i wonder if it would be worthwhile (and how hard it would be) to clean up the code a little bit so that this is easier. i
[2025-01-24 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus: i'm not sure exactly what that would entail, but for example there is some wonkiness with items around "owner" vs "current location", and around "creater vs owner" if both are not specified. there are probably other edge issues
[2025-01-24 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus: just a thought as I have no specific comment and its been like a year since i looked at the code. but for example, what happens if you set "region" and "watershed" but not polity on something?
[2025-01-24 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus: i guess it is mostly a matter of getting the display right
[2025-01-24 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus: but also there might be quirks or subties with how the chain of whereabouts works, e.g. since i think that always follows current location as you move up the chain
[2025-01-24 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus: anyway just idle thinking
[2025-01-24 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus: (2) what is the whereabouts for realms and how do subregions work? my guess is this stuff doesn't really work right but would be good to know. e.g., for a town in sembara, is there a way to generate a polity chain that goes "town ->` barony ->` subregion ->` sembara"
[2025-01-24 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus: and while for Sembara it is easy to say "a realm in Greater Sembara", for the Chardonian Empire what do you say? I guess just "a realm in Taelgar" if it spands multiple regions (separate issue is file organization)
[2025-01-24 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus: (3) this might suggest that initially we start with just the home/origin distinction, where home is just what it currently is, and origin is a "geographic partof" relationship
[2025-01-24 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus: (in part because i'm a little wary of leaving lots of half-finished frontmatter around)
[2025-01-24 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus: (4) as for frontmatter, I think in general something like:
    if origin != home:
    - "A (typeof) in (origin)" 
    first line - presumably never following a whereabouts chain so you only ever get the exact origin; i think in general this is fine because you typically wouldn't have multi-part part-of relationships; although e.g. the Western Gulf could be "a gulf in the Western Green Sea, Green Sea", that reads a little awkwardly to me and probably better to just say "A gulf in the Green Sea"
    - "
[2025-01-24 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus: (although - something like the Gulf of Tollen is useful to place as a subfeature of the Western Gulf, so i'm not sure)
[2025-01-24 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus: second line: Located in (feature) ->` (region) seems fine
[2025-01-24 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus: although if orgin == home you probably want just one line, "A river in (feature) ->` (region)"
[2025-01-24 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: I'm not sure I like "Ruled by" for the polity
[2025-01-24 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus: "Part of" might be fine for polity, actually
[2025-01-24 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus: poking around wikipedia a little and kind of wondering if there are some fundamental issues with our organization that make it more inflexible than we'd like, and lead to these conversations popping up and us fiddling with region definitions.
[2025-01-24 10:43 AM] Deciusmus: I think the main issue is that - unlike on Earth - we (a) don't want to fully define reality and (b) want to group pages by things other than the strict "region"
[2025-01-24 10:44 AM] Deciusmus: I also think wikipedia is a little less template driven
[2025-01-24 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus: right, what i'm thinking is that, for example:
    - in dunmar, where most invention has happened in the central and eastern regions where people are nomadic, it is not super important to define political units; instead, a lot of my invention has focused around geographic features because that is what you interact with in game
    - in sembara, where the geographic landscape is kind of generic medieval european, most of the development has instead focused on political units
    
    however, we are trying to fit these into the same kind of hierarchical clustering
[2025-01-24 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: the goal is not that we need an in depth article on the geographic of sembara, defining a bunch of basins or whatever
[2025-01-24 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-01-24 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus: then there is the fact that rivers and mountains/hills tend to be added to the map even when other features are absent, so we have a lot of regions where there are a bunch of rivers and sometimes mountains but not much else
[2025-01-24 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: poking around wikipedia a bit the big difference is that wikipedia makes no attempt to apply hierarchy to a page
[2025-01-24 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: i.e. there is no concept of "location chains"
[2025-01-24 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus: the other thing wikipedia does a lot of is rely on landing pages, portals, and lots of list pages instead of a directory structure
[2025-01-24 10:55 AM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-01-24 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: like, maybe we don't actually want to have the whole gazetteer directory structure exposed in taelgarverse, and that might simplify things
[2025-01-24 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: I'm not really sure the directory structure is the problem though. I actually think the vast majority of pages will fit neatly in the categories from yesterday, even if a couple span (i.e. the Chardonian Empire page is clearly in the "chardon" category, even though parts of it are outside), and there is a handful of pages that are "Top level" (Endless Ocean, Eastern Ocean, Green Sea, Sentinels) and then a handful of directories that don't match regions (mostly watersheds)
[2025-01-24 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: I agree that limiting how it is exposed (i.e. having a curated set of landing pages only, for example) might be nicer
[2025-01-24 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: but from an "inside obsidian" standpoint I think the directory structure can be a bit fluid
[2025-01-24 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus: maybe
[2025-01-24 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus: anyway, i'm going to be working on cosmology for a while yet, and  need to write the cloudspinner adventure, so anything you want to mess around with on the branch is sensible
[2025-01-24 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus: fwiw, i like having overview geographic pages that focus on climate, terrain/ecology, and overall geographic features as a basic worldbuilding tool
[2025-01-24 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus: i also like the style of the dunmar page as an overview of major countries
[2025-01-24 11:11 AM] Deciusmus: I don't really have interest in mucking around in Javascript much; I guess my main question is...
    
    Does it seem worthwhile to have a working but slightly jury-rigged solution, which is based on the fact that
    (a) 90%+ of places are in a single realm + single region and will therefore not change
    (b) we care more about:
    *  having "realm" top level pages, "region" top level pages, and "watershed/mountain" top level pages being able to show the lists of places in those top level pages 
    * having a good set of landing pages
    
    than we do the exact "info box" text for a page (and in particular, we are happy to use page specific info-box text lines when needed, rather than trying to have a perfect general solution)
[2025-01-24 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus: i think a jury-rigged implementation is fine. i think the main goal would to be jury-rig it in a way that makes it possible to improve if someone cares to muck about with javascript, without having to edit frontmatter (beyond displayDefaults)
[2025-01-24 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus: so i guess the main thing would be to always use synonyms instead of home/away
[2025-01-24 11:17 AM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-01-24 11:17 AM] Deciusmus: I might take a stab at dunmar re-org to see what it looks like
[2025-01-24 11:53 AM] Deciusmus: So at a high level everything moves smoothly....
    
    (a) Garamjala moves to ruins of drankor
    (b) Chataan Mountains moves to Greater Chardon (it was previously in Darba Highlands, but Darba Highlands was also defined as "the hills south of the Chataan mts, so I think moving is correct)
    
    The River Chaudi gets a bit funny as it is in the "Nayan Floodplains" which is now split across regions (north of shrev = dunmar, south of shrev = ruins of drankor).
[2025-01-24 11:59 AM] Deciusmus: I havent' done  it, but the "Greater Dunmar" main page simplies to define 4 major topological features of Greater Dunmar:
    - Yuvanti Mts
    - Nayan Floodplain
    - Darba Highlands
    - Dunmari Basin
    
    And borders:
    - Sentinels to the North
    - Nevos Sea to the west & south west
    - Mryani Gap to the west/northwest
    - Garamjala Plateau to the east
    
    The current region borders have Dunmar going all the way to the Kuthul River, but I'm not sure if that is correct and perhaps "Greater Dunmar" ends at the Kharja instead.
[2025-01-24 12:26 PM] Deciusmus: Either way, from a rivers standpoint, the Greater Dunmar region has no mixed watersheds (although the map shows the Kharja and Hara joining, the text of both of the pages makes it seem like whether they do or not is unclear, and the gazetter would make more sense to have them unjoined and unclear)
[2025-01-24 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: Nayan Floodplains should really properly refer to only the region north of the Shrev. all that is made up of the south of the shrev "increasingly jungle density as you go south", more or less ->` fairly different from the canonical savannah like / rice growing floodplains of the settled part
[2025-01-24 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: (probably including the Shrev as well)
[2025-01-24 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus: the Chaudi can just get tagged directly to the region, probably
[2025-01-24 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus: re: borders, I think it is useful to have the Nashtkar, which is the rocky deserts north of the Garamjala, lower elevation and less dry (more american southwest than high andes desert) in greater dunmar
[2025-01-24 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus: historically Kharja and Hara are part of the larger Istaros watershed (both join the Istaros north of Drankor), but in the current day they probably should both be treated as their own watersheds, with the Hara a significant watershed and the Kharja likely not, with few/no tributaries
[2025-01-24 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus: whether either/both still join the Istaros is canonically unknown, although if you had stayed with vindristjarna instead of exploring the tower of the collosus i would have had to decide as you'd have flown over the point on the map where the hara is shown to flow into the istaros
[2025-01-24 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus: re: Chataan Mts, agree it makes sense and the Dunmari aren't really mountain people, but the name is Dunmari - probably should come up with a Chardonian name at some point, or an ancient pre-Drankor name
[2025-01-24 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus: might include the Nashtkar as a fifth topological feature. i never quite worked out the topography here but based on the rivers, if the Dunmari Basin is indeed now an endorheic basin, the Nashtkar should be at a higher elevation and separate the Kharja rivershed from the Hara
[2025-01-24 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus: now back to work - are you pushing this to your region branch? i might take a look later this afternoon
[2025-01-24 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus: fiddled with the region borders a tiny bit to move the greater dunmar border to the height of land between the kharja and the kuthul in the east (approx), and to get all of the garamjala (more or less) in the drankor region
[2025-01-24 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus: but have to work now
[2025-01-24 01:34 PM] Deciusmus: I’m messing around some more at lunch. First I think I accidentally cropped the map. I was exporting it cropped (to remove far north/far south) and I didn’t mean to save the crop but I think it auto saved
[2025-01-24 01:35 PM] Deciusmus: Before we mess around with regions more might be good to restore a backup ? I can reapply the region layer I think easily enough
[2025-01-24 01:37 PM] Deciusmus: Second — names for regions most are obvious. 
    
    A few questions
    
    Northwest Coast or Mawakel Region or ??
    West Coast or Greater Chardon?
    Nevos Sea or Illoria or Southwest Coast?
[2025-01-24 01:37 PM] rsulfuratus: I’ll take a look. I usually export and then crop, or alternatively make a mask layer. ChatGPT is pretty good at photoshop instructions
[2025-01-24 01:38 PM] rsulfuratus: I think Greater Chardon and Nevos Sea
[2025-01-24 01:39 PM] rsulfuratus: Neither northwest coast or Mawakel seem quite right. Maybe northern frontier is okay?
[2025-01-24 01:39 PM] rsulfuratus: Northwest coast better than Mawakel though and probably fine
[2025-01-24 01:39 PM] Deciusmus: Very imperialist Chardon of you 😀
[2025-01-24 01:40 PM] Deciusmus: Ruins of Drankor? Desolation of Cha’mutte? Drankorian Hinterland? ??
[2025-01-24 01:40 PM] Deciusmus: Wilds of Drankor?
[2025-01-24 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: Drankorian hinterland is fine, although desolation of drankor maybe a better modern name
[2025-01-24 01:42 PM] rsulfuratus: I think drankorian hinterlands better though since only a part of the region is the desolation but whole think was core drankorian
[2025-01-24 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: The other two slightly non obvious ones are
    - sentinels? It has a big stretch of forest to the west in it
[2025-01-24 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: - Ursk/north green sea coast? Northern Green Sea kinda works but it is mostly not the green sea at all
[2025-01-24 01:54 PM] rsulfuratus: fixed the map. shared a new copy
[2025-01-24 01:54 PM] rsulfuratus: I think Sentinels is fine
[2025-01-24 01:55 PM] rsulfuratus: Ursk would be best named after the forest, but that doesn't have a name. i think Northern Green Sea is fine-ish and I can't really think of anything better. it does include a significant stretch of coast. Maybe Northern Green Sea Coast?
[2025-01-24 02:10 PM] Deciusmus: main issue is trying to avoid having both the sentinels (the mtn chain) and the sentinels (the region) have the same name
[2025-01-24 02:15 PM] rsulfuratus: ah, sure. could call the region the Central Highlands (old region name)
[2025-01-24 02:16 PM] Deciusmus: are the little islands south of illoria canonically in the nevos sea region or should I just draw a dotted ilne randomly?
[2025-01-24 02:32 PM] rsulfuratus: Nevos sea
[2025-01-24 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: here is what I have for regions
    Region List
    - Northwest Coast
    - Greater Chardon
    - Nevos and Apporia
    - Northern Sentinels
    - Central Highlands
    - Greater Dunmar
    - Greater Sembara
    - Istaros Watershed
    - Drankorian Hinterland
    - Northern Green Sea
    - Western Green Sea
[2025-01-24 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: plus the "borders" that bound the known world:
    * Endless Ocean
    * Far North
    * Eastern Green Sea
    * Far South
[2025-01-24 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: plus the features that are (a) big and (b) cross regions
    - Endless Ocean
    - Green Sea
    - ~Eastern Ocean~
    - Sentinel Range
    - Chasa-Nahadi Watershed
    - Apporian Peninsula
    - Istaros-Mahar Watershed (but unclear given Drankor issues)
    - Yeraad River Valley
[2025-01-24 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: Unclear if the Istaros-Mahar Watershed is really a thing, or if it is better thinking of the Istaros and the Mahar as two separate things, even though they do connect
[2025-01-24 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: My proposal was to
    (a) Make a folder for each of the regions in "region list" + eastern green sea
    (b) have a Faraway folder and put Far North/Far South/Omi in it
    (c) have a top level page for each of the items in the "big/cross region"
[2025-01-24 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: Istaros and Mahar are the same river, just different names
[2025-01-24 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: right, forgot that
[2025-01-24 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: any objection to removing the "northern" and "southern" continent stuff in the "World of Taelgar"
[2025-01-24 02:46 PM] rsulfuratus: I think Istaros Watershed should be “Upper Istaros” and the Istaros Watershed should get a top level page
[2025-01-24 02:47 PM] rsulfuratus: I’d put northern and southern continent stuff in brainstorming, or maybe background
[2025-01-24 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: pushed some initial stuff
[2025-01-24 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: in particular, read the re-written Geography of Taelgar, if you have a chance
[2025-01-24 07:04 PM] rsulfuratus: will look probably tomorrow morning. kate and i are about to go out but she is going to shrewsbury tomorrow so i'm going to try to finish my multiverse project. but also going to look at region stuff
