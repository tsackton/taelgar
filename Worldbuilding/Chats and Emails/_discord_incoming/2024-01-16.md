# Discord DM – 2024-01-16

[2024-01-16 11:41 AM] Deciusmus: The point on CSS was just that I thought it would be valueable to have a distinction beween:
    * CSS that all taelgar-verse websites should/must use so that something like leaflet will actully work
    * CSS that you are using to style your website but that I don't care about
[2024-01-16 11:41 AM] Deciusmus: (unless I want to copy your style)
[2024-01-16 11:42 AM] Deciusmus: doesn't matter to me if you put your stuff in the taelgarverse-site-generator because I can just ignore it, but I didn't want to ignore extras.css, and if I say, add ruler to leaflet and that requires some specific CSS to work, I want to add that to site-gen not msackton/taelgarverse1720
[2024-01-16 11:45 AM] Deciusmus: I assume BTW, you don't care about dufr/ tags.
    In between meetings I am spending a little bit of time cleaning up people. Mostly, I don't love the 100s of people you made up showing up on my taelgarverse, so I am reviewing each one and adding excludePublish: clee as needed.
    But separately, if there are minor metadata cleanups or status tag corrections I am also doing that
[2024-01-16 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus: no, don't care about the dufr tags
[2024-01-16 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus: other than the map container and the the biobox, all the css is currently only used for the homepage styling. 
    
    there is some other grid styling that may be used later for e.g. arranging npc cards but right now is only used on the homepage - that is kind of the tricky bit. also the homepage css is, kind of annoyingly, split between the home.html and the extra.css
[2024-01-16 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus: in any case i do want to clean this up - i got a much better sense of css when messing around with the homepage yesterday so i have a better understanding of what to clean
[2024-01-16 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus: my ultimate plan is not to have css in home.html, which seems silly, but to have probably 4 css files:
    - leaflet.css (move the map container here)
    - taelgarverse.css (necessary page stylings, currently just used for summary boxes)
    - grid.css (grid layouts stolen from my lab website, currently just used for home page but could be recycled elsewhere)
    - homepage.css (homepage styling)
    
    color outside the home page I am currently setting in the mkdocs.yml, but i would also put any site-wide color or format stuff not necessary for taelgarverse or leaflet into extra.css
    
    there are still some quirks, though. for example the summary box light/ dark setting depends on the name of the theme you use for dark mode in the mkdocs.yml. so even the talegarverse.css might need to be tweaked on a site-by-site basis
[2024-01-16 11:52 AM] Deciusmus: You can have muliple files targeting the same element
[2024-01-16 11:52 AM] Deciusmus: The summary color should really be outside the taelgarverse.css entirely
[2024-01-16 11:53 AM] Deciusmus: taelgarverse.css should really just contain layout stuff
[2024-01-16 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus: right, sure, you could remove the colors from .md-typeset .ext-one-column in taelgarverse.css and then only target the color in extra.css or something
[2024-01-16 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus: honestly it might be cleaner to use css ids for things like the summary box because it gets quite annoying figuring out what .md-typeset .ext-one-column is actually targetting and as I understand it, there is no reason autogenerated css elements can't just be tagged with an id, although maybe there are order-of-operations issues with multiple css targeted the same element and deciding which property is applied
[2024-01-16 11:58 AM] Deciusmus: well, it should have multiple classes, i.e. ext-one-column and also ext-summary-box
[2024-01-16 11:59 AM] Deciusmus: or perhaps just ext-summary-box, depending
[2024-01-16 12:00 PM] Deciusmus: totally separate topic, if you added dates to all the session note metadata (perhaps not worth while), it would be pretty easy to auto-link the date in a party met line to the session note where it happened
[2024-01-16 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus: Refactoring session notes has been on my list for a long time. But lots of sessions cover many days so I haven’t settled on exactly best way to handle that
[2024-01-16 12:01 PM] Deciusmus: probably just DR: and DR_end
[2024-01-16 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah makes sense
[2024-01-16 12:03 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. I was cleaning up a note (Galen) who had some line about the party attending a lecture of his. In the interest of making the note less campaign specific, I changed to a campaign line, and manually udpated to do this:
    
     `%%`^Campaign:DuFr`%%` The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] attended his lecture on [[Session 49 (DuFr)|August 22th, 1748]] in [[Chardon]], the [[Chardonian Empire]] `%%`^End`%%`
    
    (Because the text I was deleting was something like "The party attended a lecture of his in Session 49")
[2024-01-16 12:03 PM] Deciusmus: And it comes across pretty nicely, but you have to do:
    - { campaign: DuFr, type: attended his lecture, date: 1748-08-22, format: "`<person:u>` `<met:s>` on [[Session 49 (DuFr)|`<target>`]] `<current:3rq>`" }
[2024-01-16 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus: although it would be cool to autolink, the real bottleneck is converting session note narratives into "party interaction" lines. but actually i bet chatgpt would be quite good at that, as long as there was a comment in the markdown indicating the start of each day or something
[2024-01-16 12:13 PM] Deciusmus: well, there are lots of existing interaction lines, is the thing
[2024-01-16 12:13 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, it is a bottleneck at some level, but plenty of manual cleanup does happen
[2024-01-16 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah autolinking would be great for that of course
[2024-01-16 12:14 PM] Deciusmus: My real goal is to get references to session notes out of the main body of the text as much as possible, especially for pages that are relevant to my campaign (i.e. interesting or important NPCs in the western green sea region, especially)
[2024-01-16 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus: so, i've fiddling with this a bit. it is fairly easy to get session note references and party interactions into campaign blocks and that works well. but there is still the issue of the time perspective, e.g. for a lot of tollen people, if your party goes to tollen in 1730, they would be around but might be doing different things
[2024-01-16 12:16 PM] Deciusmus: I've been using date blocks for events. But some of it doesn't work super well no matter what.
[2024-01-16 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus: and a few people have "life narratives" that then gets even more complicated - it is a lot of work to wrap each paragraph in a relevant date block
[2024-01-16 12:16 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-01-16 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: I've mostly been using excludePublish
[2024-01-16 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: or active year
[2024-01-16 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus: i was actually wondering if setting activeyear might be better
[2024-01-16 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: it isn't always clear what the right active year is though
[2024-01-16 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus: i think you could treat active year as meaning:
    the description in this note is probably roughly accurate starting from this year. it might be accurate before that year, but no guarantees
[2024-01-16 12:18 PM] Deciusmus: right, and sometimes that is clear from note context. But sometimes it isnt
[2024-01-16 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus: and then just use comments to distinguish between "in game" and "proposed"
[2024-01-16 12:19 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. take Sura or Vahaiya
[2024-01-16 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus: right, i guess i'm saying i don't really care if you set "active year" on sura to 1748
[2024-01-16 12:19 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2024-01-16 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus: if your party ever goes to dunmar and meets a young pre-mirror sura, then it is worth the effort to wrap the pre- and post-mirror history in date blocks
[2024-01-16 12:20 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-01-16 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus: so active year is not a canon thing, it is a 'this person hasn't interacted with players before this year' thing
[2024-01-16 12:21 PM] Deciusmus: I guess active year is better than exclude published where the note has sufficient context to guess a reasonable active year
[2024-01-16 12:21 PM] Deciusmus: but for someone like Vahaiya, I'd be inclined to just change the note so the one line about settling in Orenlas is wrapped in a date block
[2024-01-16 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus: right, for npcs that have interacted with players in multiple campaigns that the best option for sure
[2024-01-16 12:23 PM] Deciusmus: and for a page like Herasto (a random centaur with no date info at all), I've just been setting excludePublish rather than trying to decipher a meaningful date
[2024-01-16 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, that works, although i might suggest that it would be preferred to just set active year 1747 for those
[2024-01-16 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus: a good default active year for anything i made up with no context is 1747, as the great library campaign began early 1747 so nothing is from prior to that date
[2024-01-16 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus: although it doesn't really matter either way tbh
[2024-01-16 12:39 PM] Deciusmus: I've done like 2 pages. I can switch to active year instead and reserve exclude for things that are clearly active in the 1720s but that I dont want to publish for some reason
[2024-01-16 12:43 PM] Deciusmus: Although I'm leaving excludePublish for :
    * PC pages
    * things I'd never want (i.e. Ladder or Taster)
    * mystical/magic/unusual creatures who were almost certainly in fact active much earlier than 1747 but who I dont want to publish
[2024-01-16 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think that makes sense
[2024-01-16 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: (i.e. fey who I want to skip, I wouldn't want to set "active year" on Agata to 1745, although I may decide to skip publishing her page)
[2024-01-16 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-01-16 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus: btw chatgpt by itself can't quite put the whole thing together, but this is a perfect use case for the open ai api.
[2024-01-16 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus: if you cut out the context around a person, chatgpt does a great job summarizing the interaction in 2-5 words that make sense in the context: party {interaction} npc
[2024-01-16 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus: but it can't quite search through a markdown file, find all the people, and extract the context, and format it
[2024-01-16 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus: but that is easy to do. you could even just build a list of all npc pages and use that to find npc names in text
[2024-01-16 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus: would not be that expensive because you really don't need that many tokens, probably just a few dollars to do all session notes
[2024-01-16 12:51 PM] Deciusmus: do you want me to leave images on pages alone, or move them to top/right, or only move them if there is no description section?
[2024-01-16 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus: i think if there is a description section, just set to right|320 and leave (but you can tag me and i can rewrite some of those)
[2024-01-16 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus: if no description definitely feel free to move
[2024-01-16 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus: eric has done a ton of coding with the open ai API
[2024-01-16 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus: totally feasible to autogenerate a bunch of text that way. probably could write a script that would auto-insert campaign info lines for every npc based on session notes.
[2024-01-16 02:21 PM] rsulfuratus: did you push updates? i have a few minutes but don't want to do cleanup on the same notes
[2024-01-16 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: got pulled into meeting
[2024-01-16 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: will push in a sec
[2024-01-16 02:24 PM] Deciusmus: pushed
[2024-01-16 03:06 PM] Deciusmus: Here's an interesting one: Arryn III, the king of Sembara in 1748, but a young boy and princeling of Tyrwingha in 1720
[2024-01-16 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: It would actually be generally useful to have a ^DateEnd:xxx which included a block of the date is less than the date
[2024-01-16 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i guess if the idea is to have two separate blocks of text, one for 1720 and one for 1748, you want to exclude the 1720 one. that is kind of a lot of work, though, and is it really more useful than campaign blocks?
[2024-01-16 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: if it isn't trivial campaign blocks do basically the same thing
[2024-01-16 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean it is trivial to code
[2024-01-16 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: just slightly more work to fix the campaign block if my game time-skips, for example
[2024-01-16 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: but  I dont even know if/how much time skip I will do
[2024-01-16 03:21 PM] Deciusmus: I was just thinking, if I am bothering to rewrite a page from the perspective of 1720, it seems nicer to do
    
    `%%`^DateEnd:1725`%%`
    some text
    `%%`^End`%%`
    
    `%%`^Date:1745`%%`
    original text
    `%%`^End`%%`
    
    Then the exact same thing with Clee/DuFr
[2024-01-16 03:22 PM] rsulfuratus: I think for parsing it is easier to use `%%`^Date:1745e`%%` to mean "remove this text if export date is after date"
[2024-01-16 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2024-01-16 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: The main use case I have for this would be a handful of Sembaran royals
[2024-01-16 03:24 PM] Deciusmus: But someone like Sura could be a use case as well, where (if it came up) it would be a lot simpler to write a "pre-mirror" short stub block
[2024-01-16 03:25 PM] Deciusmus: (i.e. then try to rewrite the whole long "post-mirror" article with various date blocks to get it to work correctly)
[2024-01-16 03:25 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm adding this now
[2024-01-16 03:26 PM] rsulfuratus: since the code means "remove this block if current date is `**`a**fter date in block", let's use `%%`^Date:1745a`%%`
[2024-01-16 03:28 PM] Deciusmus: ```
    `%%`^Date:1721a`%%`
    A young princeling of [[Tyrwingha]], he is a quite and mild-mannered child who is said to particularly love stories about his namesake, [[Arryn I]]. 
    `%%`^End`%%`
    
    `%%`^Date:1740`%%`
    The king of Sembara in the 1740s, he is a quiet ruler and has largely maintained the peace and prosperity of his mother, [[Elaine II]]. He came to the throne in DR 1745 on her death. 
    `%%`^End`%%`
    ```
[2024-01-16 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed untested code
[2024-01-16 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: will try to test in a bit
[2024-01-16 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: but lots of actual work to do
[2024-01-16 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: I will try to test it later. Going to me 3:30 meeting now so won't have time for a while either
[2024-01-16 03:54 PM] rsulfuratus: is your css to make "right" work in obsidian in the repo?
[2024-01-16 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: how does one specify custom linker text in a whereabout line again? i can't remember if that was something you implemented
[2024-01-16 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. last line should be **from**
[2024-01-16 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-EA2F0.png]]
[2024-01-16 04:18 PM] Deciusmus: pushed the snippet
[2024-01-16 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: you need to go into obisidian UI and enable it
[2024-01-16 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-FE414.png]]
[2024-01-16 04:22 PM] Deciusmus: so you can set the format on the campaign info line, i.e. 
    
    { format = "`<met:u>` `<person:q>` on `<target>` `<current:3Frq>`" }
[2024-01-16 04:23 PM] Deciusmus: where person is the person/campaign, target is the date, current is the current location on the date, met is the met verb
[2024-01-16 04:23 PM] Deciusmus: but you shouldn't have to .. what is your whereabout line for the aboleth lair
[2024-01-16 04:25 PM] rsulfuratus: the aboleth lair doesn't have a page
[2024-01-16 04:25 PM] rsulfuratus: {type: away, start: 1748-10-08, end: 1748-10-14, location: the aboleth lair east of Vermillion Isles}
[2024-01-16 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: right, there is actually a bug or subtle issue here
[2024-01-16 04:27 PM] Deciusmus: So basically...
    
    1. you can set "linkText" in the line, i.e.
    {type: away, start: 1748-10-08, end: 1748-10-14, location: the aboleth lair east of Vermillion Isles, linkText: from}
[2024-01-16 04:27 PM] rsulfuratus: right that is what I was trying to rememver
[2024-01-16 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: but 2. the linkText is ignored when the page doesn't exist, because we turn it into:
    {type: away, start: 1748-10-08, end: 1748-10-14, location: Vermillion Isles, linkText: the aboleth lair east of }
[2024-01-16 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: You can either
    (a) use an alias instead:
    {type: away, start: 1748-10-08, end: 1748-10-14, location: Vermillion Isles, alias: the aboleth lair east of Vermillion Isles, linkText: from}
[2024-01-16 04:29 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it is better to set it in the frontmatter, because if I ever made a page from the aboleth's lair, that is the only option where regenerating the header would produce the correct location link
[2024-01-16 04:30 PM] Deciusmus: (b) set format on the campaign line:
    - {campaign: dufr, person: Wellby, date: 1748-10-14, type: rescued by, format: "`<met:u>` `<person:q>` on `<target>` from `<current:3Frq>`"}
[2024-01-16 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: the format on the campaign line is probaby the right option
[2024-01-16 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: but the alias works better with location searches, i.e. a dataview query for everyone in the Vermillion Isles
[2024-01-16 04:34 PM] rsulfuratus: well sure but the aboleth lair isn't in the vermillion isles, it a day's sail east
[2024-01-16 04:35 PM] Deciusmus: in that case, the format is almost certainly correct approach
[2024-01-16 04:35 PM] rsulfuratus: another question - how do the format lines work again in whereabouts? I am experimenting for fun with rewriting Umli's page to be date agnostic, but I want to put the length of time she's lived in Tollen in the header, if that is her home location
[2024-01-16 04:38 PM] rsulfuratus: ah actually I guess that is not possible since it uses dates from the tollen page, not the umli page
[2024-01-16 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure I totally follow
[2024-01-16 04:39 PM] Deciusmus: are you trying to have something like
    
    Based in Tollen (since 1733)
[2024-01-16 04:39 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, or Based in Tollen (for 15 years)
[2024-01-16 04:40 PM] rsulfuratus: basically i deleted the sentence from the overview "Umli has been based in Tollen for the past 15 years" but wanted to see if it is possible to capture that information in the header
[2024-01-16 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: you can almost do it with affiliations:
![[../_discord_assets/image-6F410.png]]
[2024-01-16 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: it doesn't really matter, was just seeing if it was possible
[2024-01-16 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: you could do it with affiliations by overriding wHome and the affiliation display defaults but that would then mess things up at earlier dates, easier just to use the `%%` date blocks
[2024-01-16 04:46 PM] Deciusmus: I would be fairly trivial to have the whereabouts formatting for home pass in the start/end
[2024-01-16 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-83286.png]]
[2024-01-16 04:55 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that is what I was going for, i like it
[2024-01-16 04:56 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-09C31.png]]
[2024-01-16 04:56 PM] rsulfuratus: but can't you just put the format on the Tollen line?
[2024-01-16 04:56 PM] Deciusmus: only perhaps meaningless downside is that it means you can't access the person's *actual* age or born/died dates in a whereabouts line
[2024-01-16 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that also works
![[../_discord_assets/image-13C7B.png]]
[2024-01-16 04:58 PM] rsulfuratus: you could even put "wOrigin" on the Sivnjo Mountains line to say "Exiled from `<origin>` in `<enddate>`"
[2024-01-16 04:58 PM] rsulfuratus: that should only trigger if it is not the home, correct?
[2024-01-16 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, although I didn't put the date logic in origin, but easy to
[2024-01-16 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: 1720:
![[../_discord_assets/image-C3828.png]]
[2024-01-16 05:02 PM] Deciusmus: 1750:
![[../_discord_assets/image-AB739.png]]
[2024-01-16 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: future-proofing for Umli's eventual death is *probably* not necessary unless something goes drastically wrong 😆
[2024-01-16 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: I was just testing to make sure it works 🙂
[2024-01-16 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. that it correctly calculated from the death date  not the end date
[2024-01-16 05:07 PM] Deciusmus: pushed
[2024-01-16 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed my umli page
[2024-01-16 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: obviously wouldn't do that for everyone but it is kind of a fun exercise. if your group goes to tollen in 1730, she isn't there and you just get the text about her being a metalworker and smith. in 1735, she is in tollen but not affiliated with university or the focus of rumors. by 1738 she is well known
[2024-01-16 05:18 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-01-16 05:19 PM] Deciusmus: That type of page works well for an interesting minor character.
[2024-01-16 05:19 PM] rsulfuratus: vahaiya would be a good page to write like this as that is actually more relevant
[2024-01-16 05:46 PM] rsulfuratus: do you think anything would break if we changed the formatter for random metadata to name instead of casing? 
    
    use case is added a deity or similar tag to organize religions/mystery cults, etc, instead of using subtypeof.
    
    e.g. this works fine but doesn't auto-link

[2024-01-16 05:47 PM] Deciusmus: potentially you get some weird the's scattered around maybe?
[2024-01-16 05:47 PM] Deciusmus: I'm trying to finish some work stuff then make dinner so can't check right now but that would be my guess
[2024-01-16 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: for diety the the's are probably right
[2024-01-16 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: but for say, type of you wouldn't want "the mystery cult"
[2024-01-16 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: although I don't remember the nuances super well
[2024-01-16 07:40 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a very subtle bug in the affiliations manager, where when you get normalized affiliations, they always have a date set (it is never undefined), but this means that prefixes don't work properly and you get:

[2024-01-16 07:43 PM] rsulfuratus: i fixed it by adding:
    ```
    if (value.isNormalizedDate && value.isHiddenDate) return ""
    ``` 
    to the token parser but I don't know if there are other things this will break
[2024-01-16 08:15 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a ton of regenerated headers, fyi, not changing any information but just working towards getting rid of all the pages in "Old Header Version" (which produce callouts instead of summary boxes on website)
[2024-01-16 08:26 PM] Deciusmus: The token parser change is fine; but the actual bug is in getLeadBy
[2024-01-16 08:28 PM] Deciusmus: most things have a "no date/past/current" format string, lead by doesn't (it probably should, honestly). But even so, it shouldn't be passing a "bad" date along. But actually, token parser fix is fine
[2024-01-16 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: Your token casing change generates things like this

[2024-01-16 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: (as opposed to Prince/High King)
[2024-01-16 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: I think we should revert and just special case deity
[2024-01-16 08:45 PM] rsulfuratus: what is the display string that is creating that?
[2024-01-16 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: affiliationtitle
[2024-01-16 08:45 PM] rsulfuratus: why not just exclude article?
[2024-01-16 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: "ruledBy" : "`<affiliationtitle:t>`: `<name>` `<((since )startDate())>`",
[2024-01-16 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: I guess that works just as well
[2024-01-16 08:47 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that works fine
[2024-01-16 08:47 PM] Deciusmus: I will just do that
[2024-01-16 08:51 PM] rsulfuratus: ah i see you are using metadata overrides to create a new metadata entry called affiliationtitle before passing to TokenParser. I was trying to figure out how you ended up getting affiliationtitle as a metadata entry
[2024-01-16 08:51 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-01-16 09:05 PM] rsulfuratus: made a few tweaks to the campaign rules in export_vault to allow multiple target campaigns (e.g. if I want to do mc and dufr). should still work exactly as previous with only one campaign but let me know if you see bugs
[2024-01-16 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: excludePublish works on "all" so if any of the campaigns in your list are in the excludePublish list, the note is excluded
    
    comment stripping works on "any" so if any of the campaigns in your list match, the content is passed along
[2024-01-16 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: We don't have a good way to track NPCs who the party just knows, i.e. in my game there are a bunch of "important" NPCs who the party meets almost every day. Tracking via "campaign info" is a bit wrong, but it is kinda nice to have the ability to flag "known to party" vs not
[2024-01-16 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: just a comment
[2024-01-16 09:50 PM] rsulfuratus: this was the idea behind my tag system, but it is a bit of a pain to maintain. i have been thinking about something autogenerated based on session note mentions but that only works with detailed session notes
