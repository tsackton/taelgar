# Discord DM – 2023-01-24

[2023-01-24 09:38 AM] rsulfuratus: spent a bit of time on my timeline/date system last night and this morning
    
    the basic system I am coming towards is made up of three parts. the fundamental unit is a daily note, which has type: Daily Note and taelgar-date: YYYY-MM-DD in the metadata, and then one or more events, where each event is indicated by this format:
    ```
    ## header
    { secret: (true/false), campaign: `[ ]`, title: (optional), people `[ ]` }
    
    Text goes here
    
    ---
    ```
[2023-01-24 09:39 AM] rsulfuratus: I have a script to convert csv timelines with date as the first column into these daily notes, which will also append events if the daily note already exists
[2023-01-24 09:40 AM] rsulfuratus: this can allow quick additions to the daily notes, e.g. if I have the timeline of some NPC in onenote or something I can copy it to a csv and just append it to the correct daily notes
[2023-01-24 09:41 AM] rsulfuratus: this part is done
[2023-01-24 09:47 AM] rsulfuratus: the second piece is a script to insert pure markdown timelines into notes. at a minimum I think I would need two classes of timelines. one takes all events from date x to date y, optionally filtered for campaign/secrets, formats and inserts them as a timeline (e.g. for session notes or for a 'master timeline' of all Taelgar events). the other takes all events tagged with people == X and/or all events that mention person X and inserts them into a note, for things like NPC chronology. since this would use a regex to find events that mention X, could also be used to create timelines for places (who was where when) or things like that, which can occasionally be helpful (e.g. when PCs are at Place X asking about NPCs of type Y, e.g. in Tokra asking "have any Chardonians been around?")
[2023-01-24 09:51 AM] rsulfuratus: although it would be great to have this as a templater function, realistically I think I will probably write this in python since I'm not sure I want to tackle complicated string parsing and regexes in javascript. but in theory this could be ported to javascript if desired, so it could be run as a templater template. the other option would be to use the templater option to create user functions linked to system commands, which would mean it would conceivably be possible to create a user function that did something like 'python insert_template.py'
[2023-01-24 09:55 AM] rsulfuratus: the third piece is a script to generate fantasy calendar events from the daily notes, and potentially vice versa. creating events would probably be based off making notes with the proper yaml, but reading fc events to insert into daily notes would probably be done by reading the json. the main idea here is that I don't necessarily want a separate event for every daily note, but it is nice to see certain things on the calendar. i'm still thinking about this a bit.
[2023-01-24 11:44 AM] Deciusmus: That sounds very optimized for a different use case that mine
[2023-01-24 11:45 AM] Deciusmus: Which is fine
[2023-01-24 11:45 AM] Deciusmus: I just doubt I’d use any of it
[2023-01-24 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus: right, none of this is stuff I would anticipate you being interested in. the main question is making sure I don't overwrite your system
[2023-01-24 11:46 AM] Deciusmus: So I guess the question would be: for what type of notes would you run your second script
[2023-01-24 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus: definitely session notes and for a master timeline (by year or month/year) in my DM notes and possibly for export; almost definitely also for NPCs, maybe for places
[2023-01-24 11:47 AM] Deciusmus: If I understand your system you basically have a daily note for each taelgar day where something interesting happened
[2023-01-24 11:47 AM] Deciusmus: Which would have headers for each event
[2023-01-24 11:48 AM] Deciusmus: So one day might have several events— party heals hrothgar, Grash leaves Kherson, etc
[2023-01-24 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-01-24 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus: this is just replicating my current nasty onenote table in a better more flexible format
[2023-01-24 11:49 AM] Deciusmus: The you want to be able to back-fill that into an NPC or place note
[2023-01-24 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus: right
[2023-01-24 11:49 AM] Deciusmus: So the Kherson note would have a timeline of all the events that from the daily notes that happened in Kherson
[2023-01-24 11:50 AM] Deciusmus: Or NPC X would have a timeline of all the events that happened to them
[2023-01-24 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus: yes, conceivably.
[2023-01-24 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus: not sure where exactly I would use this - in my old onenote system is was impossible to do anything dynamically so I just had a big table and would reference it as needed. could end up just doing the same thing, using obsidian search or backlinks just to find all the daily notes where XX person or place is linked
[2023-01-24 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus: or mentioned via search
[2023-01-24 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus: but trying to design the system at the start so it can potentially interface with fantasy calendar events and also with inserting templates
[2023-01-24 11:56 AM] Deciusmus: Right...
[2023-01-24 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus: and also not break stuff that you add to notes, e.g. if there is a chronology section for Crossroads Inn and you have a bunch of stuff there and I want to add "Marcella arrives after crossing the ~CentralMountains~"
[2023-01-24 11:57 AM] Deciusmus: Right
[2023-01-24 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus: I need to not erase anything you already have
[2023-01-24 11:57 AM] Deciusmus: That was my main thought
[2023-01-24 11:57 AM] Deciusmus: for shared NPCs and Places, I would (probably) mostly just manually write notes to start
[2023-01-24 11:57 AM] Deciusmus: That said, I'm not sure if I actually want to do that as it doesn't scale super well
[2023-01-24 11:57 AM] Deciusmus: I am very much leaning toward a system where I create a page for each event
[2023-01-24 11:58 AM] Deciusmus: I can easily tag those with taelgar-date though
[2023-01-24 11:59 AM] Deciusmus: Is there a reason not to have a page per event
[2023-01-24 11:59 AM] Deciusmus: ?
[2023-01-24 11:59 AM] Deciusmus: My noodling around was more like, what if each event had:
    * date
    * location
    * people
    
    in the frontmatter
[2023-01-24 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus: my issue is that my current notes are hugely varying in usefulness, e.g. I have some days where I just have "party continued sailing across the Nevos Sea towards Chardon" and it gets really cluttered to have an event for every single day
[2023-01-24 12:00 PM] Deciusmus: and then you could fairly trivially generate a dataview
[2023-01-24 12:00 PM] Deciusmus: I don't mean a calendar event
[2023-01-24 12:00 PM] Deciusmus: I mean an obsidian page for each event
[2023-01-24 12:00 PM] Deciusmus: I thought you were planning on having a page-per-day
[2023-01-24 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, I have a page per day. but then I am going to separately create events from specific subsets
[2023-01-24 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus: still thinking about this a bit
[2023-01-24 12:02 PM] Deciusmus: What is the advantage in page-per-day rather than page-for-each header within the page per day
[2023-01-24 12:03 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. rather than having:
    
    --
    type: event
    taelgar-date: 1719-10-21
    ---
    
    ## Party Arrives in Cleenseau
    stuff
    
    ## Attack on Taviose
    stuff
[2023-01-24 12:03 PM] rsulfuratus: I have a short meeting now will resume in 20 minutes
[2023-01-24 12:03 PM] Deciusmus: have:
    File 1:
    --
    type: event
    taelgar-date: 1719-10-21
    ---
    
    ## Party Arrives in Cleenseau
    stuff
    
    File2:
    --
    type: event
    taelgar-date: 1719-10-21
    ---
    
    ## Attack on Taviose
    stuff
[2023-01-24 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus: mostly just because it makes it harder to move things around between "headers"
[2023-01-24 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus: okay so back to this while I eat lunch - I tried making separate notes for each header, but it got really cluttered and it is harder to reorganize and I didn't really like it. 
    
    but I think the best solution ultimately is to have both notes with type = Daily Note and notes with type = Event. both notes require a taelgar-date: YYYY-MM-DD. a Daily Note note is parsed assuming each h2 block is a separate event, an Event note is parsed assuming the entire text of the note is the event
[2023-01-24 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus: so my text insertion code would parse all Event and Daily Note notes, getting metadata from the json string following the h2 header for Daily Notes and the yaml frontmatter for Events
[2023-01-24 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: then the only complication is how to sync things up
[2023-01-24 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: probably the simplest thing is to have the template code detect existing events and only insert new ones, optionally generating an event note or a csv (to import to daily notes) for anything new that it doesn't know about
[2023-01-24 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: this would mean we don't need to share our events directories (which can get a little annoying, especially because comments don't render in the note preview, which means that `%%`SECRET secret stuff `%%` doesn't show up in the preview of a fc event on the calendar)
[2023-01-24 01:06 PM] rsulfuratus: I think it is possible to do this as a user function that runs "python _scripts/python/generate_timeline.py --file `<% tp.file.path() %>`" or something like that
[2023-01-24 01:08 PM] rsulfuratus: probably would also need to pass the vault directory or something but should presumably be able to get that from tp.obsidian
[2023-01-24 01:14 PM] Deciusmus: The reason I was asking is that for a lot  of shared purposes, a type = event probably works better
[2023-01-24 01:15 PM] Deciusmus: I would rather than a template or dataview query that inserts a timeline from the yaml frontmatter than a python script, to be honest
[2023-01-24 01:16 PM] rsulfuratus: right, I mean conceivably this could all be done with templates
[2023-01-24 01:16 PM] Deciusmus: I gotta run to a meeting but more in a it
[2023-01-24 01:29 PM] rsulfuratus: the limitations of templater or dataview are, imo: 
    1) I don't want to have to backfill tags for every event I already have; using a regex to search for a specific string in all events generally the behavior I would want when generating a timeline. while I sure this is technically possible with javascript/templater it would be a lot faster for me to write it in python
    2) I want to be able preserve existing text that doesn't match any known events in a chronology section, and ideally to modify the datastore (either by creating events or by creating a csv file to read into daily notes or both) to add those unknown events to a central place. this is also probably technically possible in javascript/templater but a lot more complicated
    3) I am tempted to use this to play around with the python openai api, to do things like generate a short summary of any text longer than 25-50 words for the chronology section, with a link back to a (potentially autogenerated) event for the rest of the text.
[2023-01-24 01:31 PM] rsulfuratus: but honestly this can all theoretically live alongside a separate templater function that does nothing but query yaml frontmatter and insert formatted markdown - as long as the templater function is capable of detecting existing text and leaving it alone
[2023-01-24 01:32 PM] rsulfuratus: (and ideally checking for duplicate text and only printing events that are not already in the chronology)
[2023-01-24 01:33 PM] rsulfuratus: so we can in theory have totally different ways of handling events as long as we both: a) generate raw markdown in the same format/style, and b) preserve existing text in chronology sections unchanged while avoiding adding duplicate lines
[2023-01-24 01:45 PM] rsulfuratus: actually the openAI python library looks extremely powerful. e.g.: https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-tldr-summary
[2023-01-24 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: I could just add a 25 word summary to every note that is >` 250 words or something like that
[2023-01-24 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: and use it to auto-create 5 word titles for fantasy calendar events
[2023-01-24 02:02 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I think (b) preserving existing text starts to get pretty complicated
[2023-01-24 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: if you call the open AI library, for example, how do you know what the "existing text" is
[2023-01-24 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: It would be possible to tag each section in the chronology with the source note but it all starts to feel very complicated
[2023-01-24 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: Here is what I am imagining the script would do:
[2023-01-24 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: 1) read vault and make a dict of all events from daily notes and event notes
[2023-01-24 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: 2) read the file and find the chronology section to replace
[2023-01-24 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: 3) parse the chronology section into a date/string dict
[2023-01-24 02:21 PM] rsulfuratus: 4) filter the vault dict into date/string
[2023-01-24 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: Not to interrupt... but I guess I'm mostly having a hard time figuring out where -- outside of session notes and a campaign timeline -- you'd actually want a chronology section that wasn't "hand written"
[2023-01-24 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: What does the chronology section for, say, Ausson's Crossing look like?
[2023-01-24 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: It feels a bit weird to have "1748: Marcella arrives" all by itself, like that is somehow a meaningful event
[2023-01-24 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: Why would anyone care?
[2023-01-24 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: I can see wanted to see what NPCs are around a place, but you know that from whereabouts
[2023-01-24 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: Places I am not sure about usefulness
[2023-01-24 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: and I can see wanting to have a chronology of a place but I feel like if I was ever doing that I'd make it up, and what I'd really want to is find the backlinks to the place and then manually decide if I wanted to insert the event
[2023-01-24 02:24 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah, it may be this is the easiest way and the number of NPCs / places I want chronologies for is small enough that back links are best
[2023-01-24 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: I am not going to write this templating code imminently
[2023-01-24 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: But I do want to get all my campaign timelines and events into obsidian asap so I am trying to think through what I might do with them later to inform that process
[2023-01-24 02:26 PM] rsulfuratus: But honestly given that you are not likely to use my daily note structure none of this likely matters for not
[2023-01-24 02:26 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`now
[2023-01-24 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: part of the reason I was thinking metadata would be nice would be because I would be tempted to have a dataview that just shows all of the events that happened to a certain NPC
[2023-01-24 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: to make a quick timline
[2023-01-24 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: for an NPC that shows up a lot the backlinks could get a little drowned out by the session note backlinks
[2023-01-24 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: For example, in my Cleenseau campaign, Rosalind the heir-apparent to the manor is a pretty key NPC
[2023-01-24 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: in say 6 sessions, I could see it becoming useful to make up her life story a little more completely, or for me to just want to see an overview of her interactions with the party
[2023-01-24 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: But I think I'd want to do that with a dataview block on her page which would explicitly not get exported, as a way for me to see what has happened
[2023-01-24 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: and than I'd decide how the info in that dataview block influences the life story I end up writing for her
[2023-01-24 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: So to assisst that, I am likely to try really hard to make small notes for each event in her life (if I don't just add it directly to her page, which is the other possibility)
[2023-01-24 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. if in game I describe how she came to meet her husband, I'd be tempted to write it up as a The Meeting of Rosalind and Arthur note standalone
[2023-01-24 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: I see why you wouldn't want to do that, but I think that one of the challenges is that I don't necessarily want to lock in a chronology section as being 100% generated from notes
[2023-01-24 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: Right that is the logic behind preserving existing text in the chronology section
[2023-01-24 02:32 PM] Deciusmus: I think the concern would be that it really locks in the format and structure
[2023-01-24 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe it doesn't?
[2023-01-24 02:33 PM] rsulfuratus: Ah. If you want something more Freeform, yeah I guess that would be an issue
[2023-01-24 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: I think my concern is that if I was just making up a history of something it would be more natural to just write it
[2023-01-24 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: ### Chronology of Events
    
    * [[Founding of Ausson's Crossing|Ausson's Crossing]] was founded in 1642 by someone and someone
    * In 1658, the [[Plague of BlahBlah]] ravanged the borderlands, and Ausson's Crossing was instramental in
[2023-01-24 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: Again, realistically, I'm not sure this is a concern
[2023-01-24 02:34 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess I was thinking the chronology section would be modeled on the timeline plug-in in the sense it auto populates from defined other notes
[2023-01-24 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: Your daily note structure is really intended to cover session notes and campaign timelines more than anything else, I assume
[2023-01-24 02:34 PM] rsulfuratus: Yes
[2023-01-24 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: For a session note header, I think I'd want to do it that one
[2023-01-24 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: Same for a campaign timline, because in both cases I'm not really making up something whole cloth
[2023-01-24 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: I'm coming up with a way to visualize the scraps of information I've made up in game
[2023-01-24 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: or in session prep
[2023-01-24 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: or whatever
[2023-01-24 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: But if I was doing session prep and decided I wanted to make up the history of Cleenseau for the past two generations, because it was going to be relevant to the next session, I'd really prefer to just write it down in the note
[2023-01-24 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: I actually think this is all irrelevant
[2023-01-24 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: in that, if we broadly agree that we should use taelgar-date for events
[2023-01-24 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: and we should have a type of event or dailyNote
[2023-01-24 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: we can see where it goes
[2023-01-24 02:44 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I was about to type something similar but more complicate
[2023-01-24 02:47 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the following should be true:
    1) All notes with type = Event define something that happened at a specific time in Taelgar. 
    2) all events have a taelgar-date and optionally a taelgar-end-date that indicates when they happened
    3) any code that works with taelgar-date metadata should accept dates in YYYY, YYYY-MM, or YYYY-MM-DD format
    4) if subtypes are required (e.g., for my daily notes or if we want a "year note" or "decade note" for historical purposes), they should be defined by subtype: XXXX and keep type: Event; code that depends on specific formats should check subtype
[2023-01-24 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: and I guess the probably-obvious corrallary that we should make sure we are using consistent metadata as needed, e.g. if we want metadata to store people associated with an event, or campaigns, or whatever we should agree on the format
[2023-01-24 02:49 PM] rsulfuratus: (and 3 doesn't necessarily mean the code has to work on plain years, just it shouldn't throw an error if it gets YYYY)
[2023-01-24 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: that makes sense
[2023-01-24 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: We should also think about what it means to link to an event note
[2023-01-24 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: because I think that implies the note is shared
[2023-01-24 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: which gets a bit interesting
[2023-01-24 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: `[ and is one big advantage of data-view]`
[2023-01-24 02:51 PM] rsulfuratus: I think probably we should try to only link to events with subtype Historical or something like that
[2023-01-24 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. most / all of what is currently in History / Historical Events
[2023-01-24 02:55 PM] rsulfuratus: I think this is something I would just see how it works out though.
[2023-01-24 02:56 PM] Deciusmus: I’m not sure about that… doesn’t that make npcs a bit sparse, ie you can’t link to anything from their pages
[2023-01-24 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: right, for your workflow where you mostly have specific events it would be a challenge
[2023-01-24 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: I at least for now don't have a lot / any actual Event notes
[2023-01-24 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-5F33F.png]]
[2023-01-24 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: it already shows up in my vault with a handful of broken links to events
[2023-01-24 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2023-01-24 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: I have the same issue with npcs and items
[2023-01-24 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: so conceivably it could make sense to just share items and events
[2023-01-24 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: you have a broken `%%`SECRET tag in Alesh btw
[2023-01-24 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: I am averting my eyes
[2023-01-24 03:00 PM] rsulfuratus: ah it isn't closed at the end of the file
[2023-01-24 03:01 PM] Deciusmus: An example is Camana
[2023-01-24 03:01 PM] rsulfuratus: I don't think it matters, I was just working out where she would be in case you were not trying to avoid people when crossing to the tower last session
[2023-01-24 03:01 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-CC763.png]]
[2023-01-24 03:01 PM] Deciusmus: The flaming bowstring link is broken
[2023-01-24 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: `[ I did not read the ALesh secret notes, I don't actually want to know ]`
[2023-01-24 03:04 PM] Deciusmus: Or in places:
![[../_discord_assets/image-F0EAC.png]]
[2023-01-24 03:05 PM] rsulfuratus: right, some of that is just from old notes that I haven't revised yet. e.g. I would change that to "In June 1748, Agata's hut was looted, but not destroyed, by PARTY NAME"
[2023-01-24 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: I don't think it matters a ton but it might be good to define what the expected end state is
[2023-01-24 03:06 PM] Deciusmus: for example, it might be worth having a shared Current Events folder
[2023-01-24 03:07 PM] Deciusmus: and if you happen to notice a broken link like the one above I can move the event file to the Current Events\1719 folder
[2023-01-24 03:07 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, I guess I just wonder about the downside to sharing all events and all items
[2023-01-24 03:08 PM] Deciusmus: items mostly if it annoys you to manage secret
[2023-01-24 03:08 PM] Deciusmus: and name collisions
[2023-01-24 03:09 PM] Deciusmus: but I guess if you are publishing items, secret data needs to be `%%` anyway so does it really matter?
[2023-01-24 03:09 PM] rsulfuratus: items all are done using `%%`SECRET `%%` anyway, since I need to comment out stuff for the web
[2023-01-24 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: honestly I think it simplifies things, basically I have a DM folder that is my session prep and other stuff, and no notes outside the DM folder ever link into DM folder notes. I have the campaign folder which is basically session notes and other campaign-specific player facing things, but I am also aiming to have nothing from outside the campaign folder link into campaign folder notes. then everything else
[2023-01-24 03:12 PM] rsulfuratus: linking to session notes is actually rarely, if ever, useful, since I typically do that because I want to know when something happened, and it would be better to have a dated event that both session notes and the place/NPC/item page could link to
[2023-01-24 03:13 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2023-01-24 03:13 PM] rsulfuratus: so I would propose that items and events get promoted to top-level folders that are entirely shared
[2023-01-24 03:13 PM] Deciusmus: maybe Curernt Events instead of Events?
[2023-01-24 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: I still think we might want to do something very different for historical events
[2023-01-24 03:14 PM] rsulfuratus: well your events aren't exactly current in 1748
[2023-01-24 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: "currentish"
[2023-01-24 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: but actually
[2023-01-24 03:14 PM] rsulfuratus: I am currently organizing my events by YYYY/MM/eventname.md
[2023-01-24 03:15 PM] rsulfuratus: why not just have Events/YYYY/MM folders and then Events/Unsorted for top level stuff
[2023-01-24 03:15 PM] rsulfuratus: then we could have historical events tend to live in the YYYY folders themselves instead of YYYY/MM folders
[2023-01-24 03:15 PM] Deciusmus: what I mean is that an event like: the Unification of Sembara under the House of Sewick
[2023-01-24 03:15 PM] Deciusmus: is a very different kind of thing than a day-and-date specific event
[2023-01-24 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: I haven't really thought about how to manage historical events, but one of my goals for the next few weeks is to rewrite the chronicle of the house of sewick to (a) be more obsidian friendly and (b) take into account the timeline shifts we discussed a month ago
[2023-01-24 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: but anyway, for the moment I think Events/YYYY/MM works
[2023-01-24 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: and we can have Unsorted and things in YYYY as well
[2023-01-24 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: if we crate a separate Events/Historical or something like that, fine
[2023-01-24 03:17 PM] rsulfuratus: can also have a generic top level "Historical Events" for things that span more than a year until we figure out a better thing to do with them
[2023-01-24 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: don't have to sort out right now
[2023-01-24 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: under events I mean, so Events/Historical
[2023-01-24 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: so it would be 
    Events
    -->`Unsorted
    -->`Historical
    -->`YYYY
[2023-01-24 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-01-24 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: and then MM/eventname.md under YYYY
[2023-01-24 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: one question: would you ever want to use it for events that haven't yet happened?
[2023-01-24 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: I keep events that haven't happened in my DM notes exclusively
[2023-01-24 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: I guess ostly those stay in _DM_ until the come up in play
[2023-01-24 03:21 PM] Deciusmus: for items I am less sure sharing makes sense to be honest
[2023-01-24 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: mostly because of all the forward links to visions in the mirror
[2023-01-24 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: and because a lot of items are pretty campaign-specific
[2023-01-24 03:24 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I guess most items are pretty campaign specific, and it is hard to keep forward links to campaign notes out of the items entirely
[2023-01-24 03:26 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess it makes sense to leave those separate for now, the handful of broken links probably don't really matter
[2023-01-24 03:27 PM] rsulfuratus: just pushed preliminary event reorg
[2023-01-24 03:27 PM] rsulfuratus: everything is in unsorted that was in historical notes
[2023-01-24 03:29 PM] Deciusmus: we can always unshare specific items if the broken links bother us
[2023-01-24 03:29 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-01-24 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: did you actually push?
[2023-01-24 03:32 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not seeing a change
[2023-01-24 03:32 PM] rsulfuratus: ah oops no, pushed now
[2023-01-24 03:48 PM] rsulfuratus: let's stick with capitalizing type categories, e.g. we have NPC, PC, Item, Ruler, Place, Building, so event should be Event
