[2023-11-21 01:23 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, and if you want to get crazy you can have as many as you wan
[2023-11-21 01:29 PM] Deciusmus: A couple of random topics.
    
    `**`Highland Kingdoms**
     I've been thinking a bit about the highland kingdoms as I was cleaning up the Sembaran regnal lines. I have some game reasons to want them to be more fleshed out, so probably making up some stuff there is going to be my next project.
    
    I don't think there is much we've defined anywhere about them right?
    
    My immediate goal is to come up with a better name - I think the entire greater Sembaran region needs a name and then the highland kingdoms can be "the `<whatever name>` highlands" (to distinguish from `<whatevername>` lowlands, which is Sembara + Tyrwingha + Maseau + Addermarch)
[2023-11-21 01:30 PM] Deciusmus: Etymology is, I think, the ancient mariner word for "land of many rivers"
[2023-11-21 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: Alternatively, the "lowlands" region ends up acquiring some Drankorian-derived name for whatever Drankor called the provinces and the ancient marnier word comes to mean just the highland section (which is the only bit not conqueored by Drankor)
[2023-11-21 01:39 PM] rsulfuratus: there isn't much defined about them, perhaps a bit in the old human migrations docs. they are supposed to be the "north/east" culture that is a mix of the northerners and mariners, basically adopt the northerner gods and the mariner language
[2023-11-21 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: language-wise  Sembara is French/English (with French more to the south and especially the old Isingue language) and Tyrwingha is Welsh/Celtic
[2023-11-21 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: but never really been clear if the highland kingdoms are closer culturally/linguistically to tyrwinghan or vostok/skaerhem
[2023-11-21 01:40 PM] Deciusmus: I think probably Vostok
[2023-11-21 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: so that puts them scandanavian/icelandic/finnish/russian, which is a linguistically odd mix but I think captures the kind of weird linguistic currents of that region
[2023-11-21 01:42 PM] Deciusmus: The current kingdom names are more slavic derived (Zovka, Lavnoch) as are the kestavo names (Kamak, Vacla)
[2023-11-21 01:42 PM] Deciusmus: Tyrwingha is actually another odd blank spot that I should probably think about given the centrality of Tyrwinghan fey to the backgrounds of 2 of my PCs
[2023-11-21 01:43 PM] rsulfuratus: In my language doc I have the Skaer/Vos language use the Eastros alphabet
[2023-11-21 01:43 PM] rsulfuratus: I am going to push my language notes to background in notes that has all the real world mappings that I've used
[2023-11-21 01:44 PM] Deciusmus: I think it actually makes sense for the highland kingdoms to be fairly culturally distinct from lowland "greater sembara"
[2023-11-21 01:45 PM] Deciusmus: Tyrwingha + Sembara + Insingue/Maseau/Addermarch have ~1000 years of shared rule under the Drankorians to culturally align
[2023-11-21 01:45 PM] Deciusmus: whereas the highland kingdoms are - at least per the current history - never conqueored
[2023-11-21 02:41 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed languages doc
[2023-11-21 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: take a look at my ideas here: https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/issues/13
[2023-11-21 04:08 PM] rsulfuratus: do you know if there is a dataview command to get all the files with a specific tag that have backlinks to any file in a specific folder?
[2023-11-21 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: from #tag gets the files with a tag
[2023-11-21 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: havent messed around with backlinks much
[2023-11-21 04:11 PM] Deciusmus: this javascript returns true:
    page("Sura").file.inlinks.some(f =>` f.path.contains("Campaigns"))
    if Sura has an inbound link from a campaign
[2023-11-21 04:40 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed some table helpers, look at the page
    
    Helpful Data View Query Examples
[2023-11-21 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: ````dataviewjs
    const { util } = customJS
    dv.table(`["Person", "Current", "Known to Clee"]`, 
                dv.pages("#person")
                    .where(f =>` util.inOrHomeLocation("Sembara", f.file.frontmatter, false))
                    .map(b =>` `[util.getName(b.file.name), util.getLoc(b.file.frontmatter), util.isKnownToParty(b.file.name, b.file.frontmatter, "clee", true, true)]`))
    ```
