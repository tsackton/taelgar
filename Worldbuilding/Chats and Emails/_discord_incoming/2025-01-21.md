# Discord DM – 2025-01-21

[2025-01-21 09:48 AM] Deciusmus: I'm fairly busy today but I do have an afternoon meeting that is mostly other people talking but that I have to attend in case someone has a question for me, during which I might do Taelgar instead of work...
    
    My goal was to try to produce a couple of maps that outlined, for the "post Downfall", "height of Drankor" and  "pre Great War":
    (a) where canonically various human and non-humans were
    (b) where the "intentional blank spots" are
    
    I've recently been playing around with Lightroom Classic, so I have temporarily switched my Adobe plan to the one that has Photoshop...
    
    So I was wondering if this would be easier if I just had the raw map Photoshop file?
[2025-01-21 09:49 AM] Deciusmus: My assumption is there are no critical secrets in there and it might be worth putting in the git repo?
[2025-01-21 09:49 AM] rsulfuratus: it is about 300 Mb, so can't go in git repo
[2025-01-21 09:50 AM] rsulfuratus: i can probably share it with you though
[2025-01-21 09:50 AM] rsulfuratus: (via Adobe)
[2025-01-21 09:52 AM] Deciusmus: you could just use Git LFS
[2025-01-21 09:54 AM] Deciusmus: might be more of a pain that it is worth though;  anywaydon't have more time right now
[2025-01-21 09:54 AM] Deciusmus: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage
[2025-01-21 09:59 AM] rsulfuratus: https://photoshop.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:1a0f772b-9a25-4c61-83b1-c1d0e1013cb1
[2025-01-21 09:59 AM] Deciusmus: yeah that worked, it just popped up in my creative cloud notifications
[2025-01-21 10:00 AM] rsulfuratus: measurement scale is 84 pixels = 50 miles
[2025-01-21 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus: not sure if that is shared or you have to set yourself
[2025-01-21 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus: i added a continent scale hex layer (24 miles edge to edge). there are probably too many hexes for it to be straightforward to label them on this scale. however, each degree latitude is ~3.5 hexes, which is a useful scale, and it makes translating from smaller hex-scale maps to the main map a lot easier
[2025-01-21 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus: now that I have the basic illustrator/photoshop interactions figured out I could add thicker lines to make a regular grid that could be labeled. the whole world is 14400 pixels square. each existing grid is 210 pixels long, 161 pixels tall
[2025-01-21 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus: if I made 3x3 grids, we'd have 23 squares across and 30 squares tall, so could label top with letters and side with numbers to have a bunch of well-defined quadrants
[2025-01-21 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus: okay, updated with labels:
    each hex is 24 miles. 
    each group of 24 miles is in a rectangle (~125 miles wide, ~96 miles high) 
    each 3x3 arrangement of rectangles is labeled.
    
    if within each 3x3 grid we label the inner rectangles 1-9 (from top left to bottom right, so 1|2|3 (next row) 4|5|6 etc, 
    
    then you can uniquely pinpoint each rectangle, e.g. Chardon is H13.1 and Drankor is L18.8
[2025-01-21 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: pinpointing the exact hex is trickier on this scale, because each rectangle of 24 hexes actually splits several because of the hex ->` rectangle conversion. but each rectangle has a regular pattern of 6 columns of 4 hexes, it is just the 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns are 0.5 hex - hex - hex - hex - 0.5 hex
[2025-01-21 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: still you could label each column A-F, and then label the hexes 1-4 or 1-6, counting half-hexes as full
[2025-01-21 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus: then if you have:
    bigGrid.littleGrid.column-row
    
    you get:
    Chardon ->` H13.1.B-5
    Karawa ->` J15.3.E-4
[2025-01-21 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus: etc
[2025-01-21 01:51 PM] Deciusmus: It would be really nice to have the text layers be Major Geographic | Minor Geographic | Major Settlement | Minor Settlement rather tha each text on its own layer
[2025-01-21 01:52 PM] rsulfuratus: you can't really do that in photoshop
[2025-01-21 01:55 PM] rsulfuratus: it is possible that a photoshop expert might have a solution using some advanced tools but if you just merge the layers they are converted to a raster image and you can no longer edit the text
[2025-01-21 01:55 PM] rsulfuratus: however it is theoretically possible - if a huge pain - to create multiple text groups for different categories
[2025-01-21 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: I sadly had to actually mostly answer questions at my previous meeting, but now have a bit of dead time before my next thing, might try to muck around a bit with maps for real.
    
    What I'm trying to do is create a new version of https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J33KjvXeFYKkMonDmhBhv7rbleEsGksv/view but without the spectualive stuff
[2025-01-21 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: and with a bit less arrows and a bit more "here's where people and non-humans were", and with the map truncated to just the "known world"
[2025-01-21 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: is that worth trying to do in photoshop, in a new layer, or should I just export a base map and do it in a separate file?
[2025-01-21 03:21 PM] rsulfuratus: either - it is easy enough to reimport if desired but i don't think photoshop layers are the right format for storing a bunch of these history maps
[2025-01-21 03:22 PM] rsulfuratus: i would just make sure we have the hexes in any export which makes it easy to realign with the main map or any future canonical hexmap
[2025-01-21 05:08 PM] rsulfuratus: I pushed an "open questions - campaigns" doc as if we are trying to get all the info into Obsidian it seems worthwhile to priotize canonical information over stuff that is probably or definitely not canonical (especially an issue for me as a good fraction of my stuff from 2019-2023 is in OneNote)
[2025-01-21 06:07 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed an update
[2025-01-21 06:28 PM] Deciusmus: also pushed a few soulstuff/land of dead thoughts
[2025-01-21 07:28 PM] rsulfuratus: looking at your comments on divine power in taelgar, perhaps easier to move to discord. i think the point about classification of magic into arcane/divine/primal is not so much about specific D&D classes, but about where on this spectrum things fall:
    (a) fey have clerics and divine magic works for fey similarly to humans; someone making a "fey cleric" character could reasonably be expected to think a little bit about what divine entity grants them power
    (b) fey have clerics that metaphysically / in-world access magic from the Plane of Creation, but not necessarily via the Material-Plane-Centric "divine powers grant miracles", suggesting an alternate route for diivine magic to manifest
    (c) fey don't have clerics. any player that wants to play a fey cleric would be assumed to be using the cleric mechanics to represent some other kind of in-world magic, and would be expected NOT to have a connection to a particular god
    
    or, put another way, do fey, in-world, pray to gods; pray in some strange fey way; or don't pray at all in any sense
[2025-01-21 07:34 PM] Deciusmus: (About to eat dinner but will be around for taelgar stuff a bit later)
[2025-01-21 07:54 PM] Deciusmus: I think it’s b or c
[2025-01-21 07:54 PM] Deciusmus: Although I’m not sure that it is impossible for fey to pray to a god
[2025-01-21 07:55 PM] rsulfuratus: right, i mean i think we've established pretty clearly that all kinds of things are possible and that at least some gods are not picky about who they get prayers from and grant prayers to
[2025-01-21 07:56 PM] rsulfuratus: but i guess that is different from "there is fey religion"
[2025-01-21 07:56 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I think the vibe of any inner plane creature praying to a god seems … non standard
[2025-01-21 07:57 PM] rsulfuratus: the original "children of the divine" logic actually got around this nicely by making fey/elementals/giants/dragons have a direct connection to the divine presence.
[2025-01-21 07:59 PM] Deciusmus: Right. Why does that have to be wrong though?
[2025-01-21 08:00 PM] Deciusmus: I mean I’m not sure if elementals have a soul on the plane of souls necessarily but if they don’t they should have some  equivalent
[2025-01-21 08:01 PM] rsulfuratus: i kind of like the vibe that none of the speculation about the plane of souls in the in-world note is correct, but the hint from the fey idea of the dreamworld being the "real" plane of souls and the plane of souls being the echo ties into your suggestion as well
[2025-01-21 08:02 PM] Deciusmus: I also like the vibe that none of them are precisely correct
[2025-01-21 08:02 PM] Deciusmus: I also like the idea of preserving unique possibilities and contingencies rather than having a complete typology or everything is exactly in a neat box
[2025-01-21 08:03 PM] Deciusmus: But one question that seems relevant - did the riving create the plane of souls and the land of the dead? What was cosmology like before the riving?
[2025-01-21 08:05 PM] rsulfuratus: it isn't clear to me at the moment
[2025-01-21 08:06 PM] rsulfuratus: the original concept of the riving pre-dates the invention of the plane of creation as a nexus for the Divine Presence
[2025-01-21 08:06 PM] rsulfuratus: so in that pre-Plane of Creation cosmology, the riving was effectively all the inner planes mixed together
[2025-01-21 08:06 PM] rsulfuratus: and dominated by arcane magical energy
[2025-01-21 08:08 PM] rsulfuratus: the riving creates the Firstborn, pulls apart the inner planes, but it was never really resolved how the land of the dead / plane of souls / spiritual realms come into existence
[2025-01-21 08:09 PM] rsulfuratus: i think i'm coming around to the idea that the plane of souls possibly always existed, and maybe the riving stretches the plane of souls into the astral plane and perhaps even creates the plane of creation as a home/embodiment of the divine presence, behind the wall of the land of the dead
[2025-01-21 08:09 PM] rsulfuratus: so that would imply the riving creates the land of the dead, but not the plane of souls which predates it
[2025-01-21 08:12 PM] rsulfuratus: (more in a bit if you are around, have to get Nathaniel to finish his homework)
[2025-01-21 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: (Was cleaning but done)
[2025-01-21 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: (So back)
[2025-01-21 08:23 PM] Deciusmus: I think the metaphysics might work better if we assume that at least the plane of souls existed forever.
[2025-01-21 08:29 PM] Deciusmus: That sets up this idea that whatever creation process existed during the riving the great wyrms and whatnot existed on the plane of souls. How that fragmented during the riving is canonically unclear but ultimately it means a fundamental divide between children of the riving - who get soul stuff “directly” - and  after the riving - who get it from gods
[2025-01-21 08:34 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah I think that makes sense. Want to let it sit a little but am going to update land of the dead tonight and will copy this discussion and update the open questions
[2025-01-21 08:36 PM] Deciusmus: There is a whole idea that could be explored about how the actual source of divine magic is _soulstuff_ not anything else
[2025-01-21 08:36 PM] Deciusmus: So the only creatures that don't have access to divine magic are those that do not have soulstuff
[2025-01-21 08:37 PM] Deciusmus: for most "normal" species, their own "personal" soul stuff is not strong enough to generate magical effects
[2025-01-21 08:37 PM] Deciusmus: but of course, what is _ki_ powers except kenzo using the power of his soul on the plane of souls to generate magical effects?
[2025-01-21 08:42 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah. Actually this could tie back into hkar - maybe part of the magic of hkar was kind of an upwelling of soulstuff somehow, so that personal soulstuff was enough for magic. At least in the early days
[2025-01-21 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: Maybe the whole thing with the void mind is it cannot create soulstuff, it can only try to shape soulstuff that escapes from the divine presence
[2025-01-21 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: Hence the desire to conquer Hkar, and the need to destroy it
[2025-01-21 08:44 PM] rsulfuratus: Could also tie into undead, and why turn undead works, and why you cant have undead clerics but you can have undead mages
[2025-01-21 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: Totally different topic... but I was just messing around with the pre-Downfall situation, and it would actually work pretty well to have all of the major "Firstborn" races have massive civilizations that met at Ulrich Pass
[2025-01-21 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: You'd extend the western gulf up along the sembaran rivers (making Embry, with its pre-downfall origin, originally a coastal city)
[2025-01-21 09:10 PM] rsulfuratus: Huh. I like that actually
[2025-01-21 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: Something like this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-9F473.png]]
[2025-01-21 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: light blue is green sea
[2025-01-21 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: green is the big swamp
[2025-01-21 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: yellow is elf
[2025-01-21 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: dark blue circle is dwarf
[2025-01-21 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: it all converges on Ulrich
[2025-01-21 09:22 PM] Deciusmus: the 4 grey circles are marniner settlements (well, one is tyrwinghan which might or might not be mariner)
[2025-01-21 09:22 PM] Deciusmus: the brown is northerner
[2025-01-21 09:32 PM] rsulfuratus: i might tweak a few details but i like the basic idea
[2025-01-21 09:32 PM] rsulfuratus: it sets tyrwingha up as pretty unusual in some respects, which probably makes sense
[2025-01-21 09:34 PM] Deciusmus: here's a slight different version - brown = human, yellow = elf, green = lizardfolk, blue = dwarf, light blue = green sea:
![[../_discord_assets/image-48F33.png]]
[2025-01-21 09:37 PM] Deciusmus: not really committed to the specific details, but the idea would be:
    
    (a) pretty much all of the core lands that will become drankorian heartland have no humans at the time Drankor expands into the lands. 
    (b) Tyrwingha is odd
    (c) Embry was founded as a coastal city
    (d) the northern Cymeans were mariner and there might be a bit of a cultural divide between north, central, and south cymea
[2025-01-21 09:38 PM] Deciusmus: it also sets up south Cymea in particular as being the most purely drankorian-successor state around, as the west coast had all these scattered humans as did the east
[2025-01-21 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: so, a few things
[2025-01-21 09:42 PM] rsulfuratus: (1) definitely more-or-less canon that the initial expansion up the istaros and across dunmar is into empty land. likely there is actually a degree of "drankorian + peronar magic restores the land that was devasted by the downfall", echoing perhaps a bit the "jeevali restores the land" although want to avoid that being a total cliche
[2025-01-21 09:42 PM] rsulfuratus: but in any case, the initial expansion - when an island dumps a few million or more people at the mouth of this river - is not war or even assimilation
[2025-01-21 09:43 PM] rsulfuratus: (2) i have a pretty clear - if vague - vision of cymea, and the main fault line is really northeast vs northwest vs south (will draw a map in a sec)
[2025-01-21 09:44 PM] rsulfuratus: (3) embry as a coastal city on founding is interesting, but pratically wouldn't it then suffer a lot? i might what are the odds the waters recede exactly to leave it as a river port after the downfall
[2025-01-21 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm sure there is a way to square that circle but it feels a little too pat to me
[2025-01-21 09:47 PM] Deciusmus: it does feel that without some degree of magic of divine intervention, it is a little pat
[2025-01-21 09:48 PM] rsulfuratus: re: cymea
![[../_discord_assets/cymea-2563F.png]]
[2025-01-21 09:48 PM] rsulfuratus: this is super rough
[2025-01-21 09:48 PM] Deciusmus: yeah but that actually lines up perfectly with my map
[2025-01-21 09:49 PM] Deciusmus: my brown circle of "old mariner" culture lines up with your green circle
[2025-01-21 09:49 PM] Deciusmus: (because we both drew it based on thehills, basically)
[2025-01-21 09:50 PM] rsulfuratus: right, okay, i guess i just think of both green + red as 'north cymea" but yeah the maps line up
[2025-01-21 09:50 PM] Deciusmus: right, yeah, I said it badly
[2025-01-21 09:51 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, I was thinking something more like:
![[../_discord_assets/image-D7028.png]]
[2025-01-21 09:52 PM] Deciusmus: but I don't have any particlarly clear thoughts
[2025-01-21 09:52 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, I like your view, not saying I am suggesting changing it or anything
[2025-01-21 09:52 PM] Deciusmus: just saying when I said "north" / "central" / "south" that is what I was thinking
[2025-01-21 09:53 PM] Deciusmus: either way, I wasn't really planning on commiting to anything in particular here
[2025-01-21 09:54 PM] Deciusmus: The main idea is that there were no meaningful human cultures in the red circle:
![[../_discord_assets/image-2FC9B.png]]
[2025-01-21 09:54 PM] Deciusmus: when drankorians land
[2025-01-21 09:55 PM] rsulfuratus: right - although also remember a good chunk of the land west of the yuvanti mountains is ocean at this point, and the mountains don't exist
[2025-01-21 09:55 PM] Deciusmus: well, yeah
[2025-01-21 09:56 PM] rsulfuratus: (that will be an interesting story when you finally figure out what actually happened when cha'mutte died)
[2025-01-21 09:56 PM] Deciusmus: is that the end of the campaign big reveal
[2025-01-21 09:56 PM] Deciusmus: ?
[2025-01-21 09:56 PM] rsulfuratus: not saying
[2025-01-21 09:57 PM] rsulfuratus: might be the destruction of the crown level 20 one shot
[2025-01-21 09:59 PM] rsulfuratus: going back to cymea - i think that actually sets up the mysterious south cymea as actually perhaps the best "byzantine equivalent" post-drankor survival of empire
[2025-01-21 09:59 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2025-01-21 09:59 PM] Deciusmus: here is the map I've playing with:
![[../_discord_assets/image-818C1.png]]
[2025-01-21 09:59 PM] Deciusmus: which is agnostic as to where the non-human empires were
[2025-01-21 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: but
    
    black circles are northern
    blue circles are mariner or mixed marnier/northern
    green is dunmari although canonically unplaced as long as it is outside the red circle
[2025-01-21 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: red is "no one"
[2025-01-21 10:01 PM] Deciusmus: blue question markers as "unknown but probably marnier" if anyone
[2025-01-21 10:01 PM] Deciusmus: black question marks are who knows
[2025-01-21 10:01 PM] Deciusmus: missing a couple of black circles for the northern migrationthat is well established
[2025-01-21 10:01 PM] Deciusmus: tywinghan is misdrawn as blue
[2025-01-21 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus: the other spot that has always been a bit of trouble is the yeraad river valley, which is notably blank on this map
[2025-01-21 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: Right. It is the first people drankor would encounter going west, but who is there? well-established northerners? no one? lizardfolk? an ancient curse? Illorians? the weird people who end up in the apporian highlands after being driven out by drankor?
[2025-01-21 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: although actually probably the illorians are the first people they encountered
[2025-01-21 10:04 PM] Deciusmus: given the idea of darba as a fort - although maybe that is a fort against the giants or whatever, not humans at all
[2025-01-21 10:05 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure it matters what was in the Yeraad River Valley pre-Drankor. The western expansion is already established as being fairly conquest/brutual compared to eastern expansion. So it is easy enough to say that from the perspective of modern day Yeraad, Drankor wiped the slate clean
[2025-01-21 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus: that's true
[2025-01-21 10:06 PM] Deciusmus: That preserves the possibility that it was a dragon or giants or an undead kingdom or something. maybe the western expansion was brutual because of whatever was in the yeraad river valley
[2025-01-21 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the darba fort is against ~ something dangerous ~ in the Nevos Sea area, not humans. this is in 377, more than 200 years before the western conquest begins
[2025-01-21 10:07 PM] Deciusmus: Right. Could also be Illorians potentially
[2025-01-21 10:08 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe the Illorians were a second group of refugees from a rival school of magical thought or something
[2025-01-21 10:08 PM] Deciusmus: or an anti-magical school of thought
[2025-01-21 10:08 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, not saying any of this is necessarily true or good, just saying, it could be anything
[2025-01-21 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, maybe. it probably doesn't matter too much until someone sets a campaign in illoria / apporia
[2025-01-21 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the main thing is this is not a fort established in support of the advancing army, darba is originally a defensive position, and naval focused (the fact that it is the one good dunmari harbor is basically because the harbor isn't dunmari)
[2025-01-21 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus: (although it might not be dunmari any more depending on how the negotiations with karnas and chardon turn out)
[2025-01-21 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: Right. From the perspective of the historical framework, all that matters is
    
    (a) the western frontier is along the Darba/Myrani Gap line and it stays that way for a while
    (b) when it changes, it changes fast and
    (c) from the perspective of post-Drankorian history, whatever was in the Mryani/Yeerad area is gone enough that it doesn't meaningfully impact post-Drankorian development
[2025-01-21 10:11 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-01-21 10:11 PM] Deciusmus: Or if it does, it is via a small, localized thing, not a major cultural factor
[2025-01-21 10:11 PM] rsulfuratus: in the modern day, all i know about this place is the border area is rough and dangerous and notorious for kobold banditry
[2025-01-21 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus: so maybe it was kobolds all along
[2025-01-21 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus: (i added the divine power chat to obsidian but not any of this history stuff)
[2025-01-21 10:15 PM] Deciusmus: I'madding it then need to go to bed
[2025-01-21 10:33 PM] Deciusmus: oops, was just cleaning up a few things before bed and was messing around with the obsidian git thing and accidentally committed a bunch of unstaged changes I didn't mean to commit, mostly images of people in the DM folder + some rewrites of regions + human culture I wasn't sure about. If you see anything weird, it is revertable, but its probably easier to just carry forward, I don't think the regions + culture rewrites were anything bad just not projects I was planning on necessarily finishing soon
