[2025-11-02 10:03 AM] Deciusmus: Any thoughts on names for the unnamed bits of mostreve
    
    My game is heading to the Tyrwinghan highlands and I was thinking about clarifying some names
[2025-11-02 10:04 AM] Deciusmus: Also there is a line of border stones with sylvan written on them do you know the truth about what they are?
[2025-11-02 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus: i don't have any notes or specific ideas but was working through some status/check/tim notes (currently on celestials) and so was going to look at mostreve hills sometime this morning
[2025-11-02 10:05 AM] Deciusmus: I assume they are warnings about morliath
[2025-11-02 10:05 AM] rsulfuratus: re: border stones - nothing canonical in game but my vague idea was exactly that yes
[2025-11-02 10:06 AM] rsulfuratus: or actually i was thinking they are written in sylvan and are potentially part of the mechanism by which ethlenn originally isolated / broke morlaith's influence over tyrwinhga
[2025-11-02 10:06 AM] Deciusmus: Write
[2025-11-02 10:06 AM] Deciusmus: Rig hy
[2025-11-02 10:06 AM] Deciusmus: Gah. Right
[2025-11-02 10:06 AM] Deciusmus: My players are fascinated by sylvan so will want the whole thing
[2025-11-02 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus: my rough idea was something like they are actually barriers that prevent morlaith-attuned fey from crossing in the material plane. later humans reinvented them as warnings from the tyrwinghan side not to cross over but the actual function / purpose (which is presumably still active, despite morlaith having long since shrunk in power/influence) is about preventing crossings from the other side (from addermarch into tyrwingha)
[2025-11-02 10:09 AM] Deciusmus: right, that makes sense
[2025-11-02 10:09 AM] Deciusmus: that was basically what I was thinking as well
[2025-11-02 10:10 AM] Deciusmus: i assume the "Addermarch fey politics" brainstorming page is reliable as to what youve invented
[2025-11-02 10:10 AM] Deciusmus: ?
[2025-11-02 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-11-02 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus: although calanthe not introduced so not necessarily canon
[2025-11-02 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus: feel free to change that bit
[2025-11-02 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus: i have been trying to make a very clear distinction between morlaith and umbraeth in my addermarch game which might not be well described in the notes but which i think is consistent with how you've run umbraeth. 
    
    in particular, morlaith is just kind of agnostic to humans, they are beneath them. whereas umbraeth is more interested in active mischief. 
    
    the setup for the current addermarch adventure is that someone from this village (Haldrenn) did something to annoy Morlaith - the rumor is stole treasure but that might not be true. and as a consequence morlaith allowed a fey portal near the village to open. 
    
    through the portal came worgs (flavored as umbraeth - actively interested in harrassing humans, etc) and a strange fey song that drove animals mad and is tied to an ancient rhyme about the hollow men (much more of a weird/dark/forest vibe)
[2025-11-02 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus: i think the implications - not fully developed - are:
    
    (1) morlaith still has some power in at least western addermarch, and humans appease the fey here too, but it is a relationship of fear not gratitude. 
    
    (2) part of that power is power over portals, which probably means umbraeth has a lot of interest in morlaith. morlaith does not have the power to completely stop umbraeth's agents traveling through their realm in the feywild, but still has some ancient unexplained power over connections.
[2025-11-02 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus: related is that part of morlaith's "punishment" of humans for not sufficiently appeasing them is allowing umbraeth's agents through the portals they control. though i think the vibe is that this is not punishment from the point of view of morlaith, it is more like a law of nature. if you knock down one of the supports of a bridge, it will collapse if the support is not repaired
[2025-11-02 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus: the villager (duncan) did something that weakened a support, and now it has to be repaired
[2025-11-02 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus: because things are collapsing
[2025-11-02 10:21 AM] Deciusmus: AFK a bit
[2025-11-02 10:30 AM] Deciusmus: Right. In reality this is an adventure about a dragon in the Tyrwinghan highlands so the fey stuff is only minor. Mostly the border stones will come up so having the backstory of them is good
[2025-11-02 10:30 AM] Deciusmus: But I think all of the above makes sense
[2025-11-02 10:34 AM] Deciusmus: slight aside - do you have any sense of the "normal" route to Orenlas, i.e. if the ambassodor from Tollen was returning home or something?
[2025-11-02 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus: my original design of orenlas for the adventure when you went there was kind of like the korok forest in breath of the wild. there isn't exactly a normal path, either the forest lets you in and you find the distances small or the forest doesn't and you wander forever
[2025-11-02 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus: i have not decided on the exact borders of the forest, though. beyond erelion, it is not well developed, but definitely extends on both sides of the lake
[2025-11-02 10:38 AM] Deciusmus: right, I get that. I don't mean orenlas _itself_... more like..
    
    if Vaihaya was returning home from Cleenseau, what route would she take?
[2025-11-02 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus: (with denser settlement on the east side)
[2025-11-02 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus: ah, i see
[2025-11-02 10:39 AM] Deciusmus: what's in yellow here?
![[../_discord_assets/image-F6DA3.png]]
[2025-11-02 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus: i think through the lazataro upriver and then through the gap between mostreve and cymea mountains
[2025-11-02 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus: that yellow circle is kinda plaguelands-y
[2025-11-02 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: right that's what I assume as well, i.e. you basically would approach Orenlas from Cymea, typically
[2025-11-02 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus: certainly west of that unnamed river anyway
[2025-11-02 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus: from cymea or the cymea/tyrwingha borderlands, yes
[2025-11-02 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus: maybe the tolln ambassador would sail to tafolwen and then go overland southeast from there, for example
[2025-11-02 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: right, makes sense
[2025-11-02 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: somewhere in the yellow circle is where I want a red dragon lair to be. The dragon has fled north because of the chaos elementals and the high-limbo wave, but the structure of my dragon adventure is basically
    
    - session 1 - find the dragon 
    - session 2 - kill the dragon, disocver where its lair is
    - session 3 - go find the lair and loot
[2025-11-02 10:44 AM] Deciusmus: I'm thinking basically..
    
    lair somewhere in the lower red circle
    traveled north along the yellow line
    currently in the small northern red circle
![[../_discord_assets/image-8BC15.png]]
[2025-11-02 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah. so my basic outline of the plaguelands is that there are really at least four, and probably more, "centers of danger". 
    
    - isingue, which is/was the heart of the limbo rift
    - darkwood and the southern borders of addermarch, which is a major part of umbraeth's realm in the feywild and dangerous for that reason
    - the burned forest, which is undefined as to what is there (and possibly saved for another campaign), but explicitly NOT tied to limbo so won't be "fixed" by isingue cure
    - hobgoblins / iron fang, which were southeast of isingue and are now a lesser threat
[2025-11-02 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: that region (the yellow circle) was the home base of the cinder court in the non-canonical original family plaguelands game
[2025-11-02 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: hrm
[2025-11-02 10:47 AM] Deciusmus: I like that structure of the plaguelands, but I'm not sure it fits my adventure. Maybe I'll move the dragon to Maseau
[2025-11-02 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus: you have the map open so i can't open it but the yellow circle is i believe on the dark side of the sunset gate so should be beyond umbraeth's influence
[2025-11-02 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: i closed the map
[2025-11-02 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus: there is also the fey realms i made up for the amberglow / cloudspinner arc, which i think creep up there
[2025-11-02 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: is there a feywild map in obsidian
[2025-11-02 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: i mean it hink it works for that area to be kind of a free-for-all. orenlas should feel besieged on all sides, really
[2025-11-02 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: no, not in obsidian
[2025-11-02 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus: right so looking at the feywild map i remember that i intentionally put the sunset gate to run along the path of the tyrwinghan border stones
[2025-11-02 10:50 AM] Deciusmus: I guess the dragon doesn't need to be fleeing limbo
[2025-11-02 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus: so, what i would do is make the war of the ashen hoard actually be a plaguelands-wide event that spreads out in all directions from isingue
[2025-11-02 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus: it is called the war of the ashen hoard from the human perspective because they only see the part that attacks aurbez / andonne
[2025-11-02 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus: but from a metaphyical perspective, there is no reason to thing that burst of limbo energy would be unidirectional
[2025-11-02 10:55 AM] Deciusmus: right, sure
[2025-11-02 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: so if the sunset gate runs along the red line (looking at the photoshop feyline map) it makes much of the south-eastern addermarch border more harrow/wend, right? ( I assume 4/5 are harrow and wend terriorities)
[2025-11-02 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-11-02 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus: rough sketch but basically
![[../_discord_assets/plaguelands-vibes-49F13.jpg]]
[2025-11-02 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus: red = non-fey stuff
    purple = fey stuff
    green = people of rainbow
[2025-11-02 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus: red 1 - limbo / ooze
    red 2 - burned forest 
    red 3 - iron fang / hobgoblins
    purple 1 - umbraeth
    purple 2 - harrow/wend
[2025-11-02 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus: exact borders very loose
[2025-11-02 11:01 AM] Deciusmus: right. do you have a more detailed map of addermarch, btw
[2025-11-02 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus: not a good one. its been on my list for a while. only have a map of the western part (carlinshire, basically) where my family game is set
[2025-11-02 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus: other plaguelands notes - 
    
    (1) orenlas should feel under siege. so it is not that the non-red area to the northeast is safe, just maybe not dominated by a single consistent type of evil
    
    (2) i want the eastern plaguelands to remain dangerous in campaign 3, hence the lack of connection to the limbo ooze. haven't thought yet about what, if anything survives of iron fang, etc
[2025-11-02 11:04 AM] Deciusmus: everything north and east of the yellow line is variously settled by Tyrwingha. Everything north and west of the green line variously settled by Addermarch. rest of map unsettled by humans.
    
    Does that fit your image?
![[../_discord_assets/image-06D11.png]]
[2025-11-02 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: yes that is consistent with my mental picture
[2025-11-02 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus: there are some addermarian fortifications more or less along the green line that i invented for non-canon campaign but have kept
[2025-11-02 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus: but settlement density drops pretty strongly as you get within a 3 days walk of the border
[2025-11-02 11:06 AM] Deciusmus: Right. Mostly, I'm looking to have the highlands themselves unsettled, same with the forest area near the river. 
    
    Then I can have the dragon perched somewhere in the highlands, raiding both into addermarch and into tyrwingha, but not a massive threat to either (hence the armies and whatnot are slow to muster. plus armies have a hard time killing dragons)
[2025-11-02 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus: yes, i think we discussed this before. this is basically " The Tyrwinghan highlands, along the Tyrwinghan Ridge and where it mets the Aure Headwaters Ridge, a land of high occasionally snowcapped peaks and difficult to pass valleys"
[2025-11-02 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus: my mental picture is that the eastern part of addermarch is poor soils and mostly pastureland, with something like highland sheep or whatever, and maybe people occasionally graze their herds in the highlands during the summer months but there is no permanent settlement
[2025-11-02 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus: e.g. "The eastern Aure river valley and nearby foothills, between the ~Aure Headwaters Ridge~ and the ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~, where the soil is poorer and the land is  grasslands mixed with rocky outcroppings"
[2025-11-02 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus: not sure if it would come up but related to the addermarch earls
    
    (The five Earls of Addermarch are known as:
    - The Earl of Adderfell, who, unlike other Earls, is the lord of the city of Adderfell (but includes some outlying villages in their demesne) 
    - The Earl of Aure, whose circuit is largely in the Aure river valley, in particular the northern and eastern stretches, interdigitating with the Earl of the Mostreve in parts of the western Aure valely
    - The Earl of Westcliff, whose circuit includes all of the [[Westcliff]], as well as parts of the upper Aure valley, especially on the western part of Addermarch. The Earl of Westcliff is the lord of three shires: [[Bramshire]] (northern hills bordering [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]]), [[Carlinshire]] (northwestern hills, upper reaches of [[Umber]]), [[Weskershire]] (West Cliff and south). These shires are each centered around major defenses on the western and northern border, and have hereditary lords. 
    - The Earl of the Highlands, whose circuit includes the eastern part of the Aure river valley, and the highlands along the Tyrwinghan border.
    - The Earl of the Southern Reaches, whose circuit includes the southern Aure. )
[2025-11-02 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus: my sense is that the earl of adderfell and the earl of westcliff are, at least in the current era (1700s) a lot more powerful / richer than the other three
[2025-11-02 11:12 AM] Deciusmus: right this would be Earl of the Highlands terrority?
[2025-11-02 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-11-02 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus: but economically highlands is by far the poorest part of addermarch
[2025-11-02 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus: some of these need to be renamed
[2025-11-02 11:13 AM] Deciusmus: totally different topic... is there anything in the Kestavo document in obisidian - ignoreing the stuff in `%%` - that seems like it shouldn't be canonical? Although I want to tweak many of the names, as kestavo should be semitic (maltaese I think our language doc has for Old Zimkovan)
[2025-11-02 11:13 AM] Deciusmus: the one-shot is going to involve kestavo, but I don't want to say too much as part of the idea is some element of mystery
[2025-11-02 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus: only things i might tweak are:
    
    (1) "Personal shrines are rare -- there is little point in having a shrine if the kestavo doesn’t inhabit it, and the rituals to coax a kestavo to establish a second home are long and complex. So some rare homes have personal shrines, but most do not. " 
    
    I think this could be deleted. I see no reason there would need to be personal shrines anywhere? What would a personal shrine even mean?
    
    (2) While the text from an in-world perspective is fine, I'm not sure the metaphysics of the vazska should be at all related to the metaphysics of the kestavo themselves.
[2025-11-02 11:18 AM] Deciusmus: right, I agree there. What do you think the metaphysics of the vazska should be?  I was thinking of them as basically similar to kestavo, although maybe they should actually be fey or demons or something?
[2025-11-02 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus: three possibilities but not committed to any path:
    
    (1) they are just the name that the local humans gave for whatever dangerous stuff was around - fey, demons, and other monsters. perhaps some of the "big ones" are minor demon lords, having attracted power, but there is not necessarily any consistent metaphysics. this might be the simplest. 
    
    (2) they are demons, drawn across to the material plane by human souls. metaphysically this works with the "abyss is the creation of the worse impulses of humanity" but there is a bit of an issue in that abyssal corruption should be a thing and it is not obvious why it wouldn't be here. 
    
    (3) they are from another plane entirely, one not invented yet. maybe a counterpart to arborea that is kind of "cruel nature" instead of "vibrant growth". why they are mostly found here is not yet determined.
[2025-11-02 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus: i would lean towards (1) and away from (2) but as i said not committed to any particular answer
[2025-11-02 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus: mostly lean away from (2) because it feels hardest to fit into what is already established about the effects of demonic occupation of the material plane
[2025-11-02 11:24 AM] Deciusmus: right. #1 works well with existing metaphyiscs, i.e. the appeasable ones are fey and the scary ones are demons/monsters
[2025-11-02 11:25 AM] rsulfuratus: i do like the idea of a cruel nature counterpart to arborea but that can fit into (1) as well if desired
[2025-11-02 11:25 AM] rsulfuratus: it feels a little constraining to have all the evil spirits from one consistent place
[2025-11-02 11:26 AM] Deciusmus: Right
[2025-11-02 11:26 AM] Deciusmus: No, I think the metaphysics works best as #1, which doesn’t limit the source
[2025-11-02 11:42 AM] Deciusmus: Ok, back to dragon... What do you think of something like this...
    
    In the aftermath of the Great War, one of Cha'mutte's red dragon lieutants established a strong hold at an extra-planar weak point marked by the red triangle. 
    
    (Weak point to either the "cruel arborea" plane or limbo or plane of fire)
    
    This dragon had two children, and ruled a small land with kobolds to serve and worship them, as well as whatever oddness came from the extraplanar weak point, and made a habit of hunting for treasure in the plaguelands and hunting any elves who foolishly left orenlas to the west.
    
    With the limbo high tide, something happened to the extra-planar weak point, and some type of extremely powerful danger emerged, or it exploded in some fashion, or something.
    
    This event 
    (a) killed the old dragon and one of the kids
    (b) left the lair in ruins, destroying much but not all of the treasure and killing many, but not all, of the servants and oddness
    
    The remaining young dragon survived  by fleeing north, and is now trying to gather strength before returning to reclaim their lair.
    
    Unbeknowst to the dragon, whatever the big danger was is actually gone, and all that is left is the aftermath and ruins
![[../_discord_assets/image-D1201.png]]
[2025-11-02 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus: (Isaac telling me about his session last night - will read in a sec)
[2025-11-02 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus: so i think that works pretty well. i like it a lot actually. 
    
    a few things i'd consider:
    (1) if it matters to develop the dragon's backstory, it's worth considering whether one of grimbaskal-style spawn of cha'mutte makes more sense than a lieutenant. either works, but a lieutenant would need a reason why they didn't fight in the conclave wars (or why they survived the conclave wars). 
    
    from my DM notes on Grimbaskal: "Grimbaskal was hatched from a clutch of eggs that grew from Cha'mutte's destroyed body. Dragon reproduction is complicated and variable in Taelgar, but one way it happens is that eggs can arise is from the death of a particularly powerful ancient dragon or great wyrm."
    
    i think you actually learned in game during the dunmar campaign that there were at least a few additional dragons that spawned from this clutch. 
    
    (2) for the weak point, two considerations. the metaphysics of the death of cha'mutte is that limbo and the material plane very briefly collided. the biggest impact of this was the landscape changes (yuvanti mountains, urlich crater) and the limbo rift, but i've always had in mind that it also scattered limbo extraplanar weak points around taelgar. so on one level that makes limbo a natural consideration here. but something else could work - in that case i'd probably make it a long-standing weak point that predated the formation of the plaguelands. 
    
    as for what happened - if limbo, easy to imagine it was destroyed by the limbo rift flaring up. that could be an opportunity to have the lair have strange elemental effects and rooms with odd gravity and such if you wanted a dungeon with those features. 
    
    if not limbo, it seems less likely that the limbo rift could destroy it, although the metaphysics of extraplanar weak points are not fully elaborated on and there is no reason to not establish this.
[2025-11-02 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus: (3) to me explosion seems simpler as it doesn't require figuring out where somehting that killed a powerful red dragon went now. but, potentially, if the "powerful being kills dragon" arc is better for you, could tie this into whatever the "war of ashen horde in orenlas" might be
[2025-11-02 12:13 PM] Deciusmus: On the dragon, I guess the other option is that there is only one dragon, and it just isn't that strong.
    
    My PCs are 8th level, so the dragon is going to be a slightly buffed "Young Red Dragon" stat block. But I guess that could be the singular spawn of Cha'mutte.
[2025-11-02 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't think there needs to be consistent metaphysics about how long it takes dragons to go from young ->` ancient
[2025-11-02 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus: grimbaskal was an adult green dragon and clearly had been operating in the elderwood for some time
[2025-11-02 12:15 PM] Deciusmus: It might actually be simpler to have the dragon just be a spawn of Cha'mutte,  but just.. weaker than Grimbaskal
[2025-11-02 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, that works
[2025-11-02 12:16 PM] Deciusmus: Although I guess I am not sure... I need there to be a reason why the dragon hasn't gone back to the lair, but also the lair vibe itself needs to be more spoky ruin
[2025-11-02 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus: though i kind of like the irony of "spawn of cha'mutte destroyed by limbo explosion"
[2025-11-02 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i think your plot line works better as a second generation descendant with the first generation descendant killed by the instigating event
[2025-11-02 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I agree
[2025-11-02 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe the ancient red dragon was the first to hatch and grimbaskal didn't hatch for 100 years afterward
[2025-11-02 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus: grimbaskal only first really starts influencing the elderwood in the early 1700s so it would be a little weird for him to have hatched in 1560 or whatever and just done nothing for 140 years
[2025-11-02 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus: so i think the timeline actually works if the first dragon to hatch from the clutch was a red dragon, who immediately fled east as a wyrmling, and then over the next 150 years grew strong enough to have a clutch of their own.
[2025-11-02 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't really like wyrmlings so my idea about dragons is they go from hatchlings ->` young dragons very quickly (like in a few years) and but then there ultimate power level is not really mappable onto d&d stats
[2025-11-02 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus: dragon reproduction is intentionally left undeveloped but is in some sense not biological and is more about reaching some power level
[2025-11-02 12:21 PM] Deciusmus: Right, that works. So my young dragon could just be 10-15 years old potentially
[2025-11-02 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, exactly
[2025-11-02 12:22 PM] Deciusmus: I’m going grocery shopping but I think that all works well. I liked limbo for weird dungeon effects as the weak point and it seems easiest for a “self contained” thing. Unless you want there to be something else there for other reasons
[2025-11-02 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus: my mental image has always been that dragons are more like PCs, they level up with milestones instead of just aging into stronger and stronger stats
[2025-11-02 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus: no i like limbo there
[2025-11-02 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus: the young dragon is harrassing the countryside to level up to get strong enough to go back to the lair, basically
[2025-11-02 12:36 PM] Deciusmus: Random thought: are their extra planar weak spots and portals in other planes, like the fey wild?
[2025-11-02 12:37 PM] Deciusmus: Or is the material plane the only place you can get to other planes from without plane shift etc
[2025-11-02 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: never thought about that. i would assume yes but i'm not quite sure
    
    my instinct is that there is (probably) not as big a fundamental metaphysical distinction between the feywild and the material plane as human scholars assume. so feywild `<->` extraplanar portals are likely possible
    
    definitely portals between elemental planes are possible although details are not fleshed out (some notes relevant to frankar arc exist but only in my DM notes)
    
    but i'm less inclined to believe that there are portals between elemental planes and spiritual realms, or among spiritual realms (although spirital realms are all in some sense by definition accessible from land of the dead / "astral plane")
[2025-11-02 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus: the plane of magic (which serves the same purpose as the ethereal plane in traditional D&D cosmology) is definitely connected in some sense to all the non-spiritual realms but how exactly is not determined
[2025-11-02 02:01 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a schematic map of mostreve (drawn using excalidraw over a screen shot of the map), plus some notes. working on updates to mostreve hills notes more generally, including name candidates
[2025-11-02 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: here is the full dragon writeup what do you think
    
    In the aftermath of the Great War, Vraedhul (VRAY-dul), the Burning Shadow, arose from the remains of Cha'mutte, one of the first of his death clutch to awake. Awash in the chaos of Limbo well still in the shell, she was born was a deep affinity for the magic of Limbo. Fleeing east, she settled on the banks of the Nimrathë near a extra-planar weak spot to Limbo.
    
    Over the years, she learned to manipulate this energy, and her lair grew with her thoughts into a series of jagged hills, with a deep crater bubbling with ash and embers in the center. She learned to craft magic items, and delighted in crafting cursed items and sending them out into the world. Sometimes, the ones she cursed would come seeking her help in removing the curse, and she would, sometimes, for a hefty price in gold and gems.
    
    She attracted the worship of kobolds (meta - not clear from were?) and corrupted the very stones and creatures of the land with the magic of Limbo to form unusual servants. At times, she tormented Orenlas, although was never able to pentrate its defenses, and she searched the Plaguelands for treasures to add to her horde. 
    
    In time, she spawned two younger dragons, Zaurmath (ZOWR-math) and Krauzeth (KROW-zeth), and delighted in them.
[2025-11-02 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: Her realm, however, was destroyed by the limbo high tide of 1720, when the extra planar weak spot burst with energy, and her lair was overthrown and she and Zaurmath were killed. What overthrew her lair is unclear: perhaps she is still alive, but trapped in Limbo. Perhaps it was merely the explosion of chaotic energy. Perhaps it was some beast or force from Limbo, hungry to reclaim the magic she had stolen. Either way, her lair is now a jumble of chaos, and much, but not all, of the treasure gone.
    
    Whatever it was, her youngest, Krauzeth, and a dozen kobolds, fled north in a desparate flight, and are now trying to establish a new base in the Tyrwinghan highlands, and grow strong enough to retake and rebuild his mother's lair.
    
    River Names:
    Velúrin (veh-LOO-reen) (called Velurino by the Isinguese) flows from Orenleas to lake, means "veiled river" or "shadowed river"
    Nimrathë (NIM-rah-thay) or Naithalë (NY-thah-lay) (called Nimrata by Isinguise or Arianrith by the Tyrwinghans), the river that flows from the foothills where the dragon's lair is
[2025-11-02 02:08 PM] Deciusmus: (I don't intend to develop what happened to Vraedhul, leaving open the possibility that she is alive somewhere)
[2025-11-02 02:08 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-BC221.png]]
[2025-11-02 02:11 PM] rsulfuratus: I like it
[2025-11-02 02:12 PM] rsulfuratus: I like naithale slightly better but generally like all river names
[2025-11-02 02:14 PM] rsulfuratus: Re: kobolds - I have this vague idea that there are various groups of kovolds scattered around the northern edges of the plague lands. No clear sense where exactly they came from but I had one in my addermarxh game who had fled from elsewhere
[2025-11-02 02:14 PM] rsulfuratus: The other places I’ve put them are all kind of fringe borderlands - west of voltara, myraeni gap
[2025-11-02 02:27 PM] rsulfuratus: on a separate topic, looking at your goblinoid comments. 
    
    while goblins have come up several times in games i've run, i've actually never used the "slaves of hobgoblins" vibe in any real way. and while i've also used bugbear statblocks, they also have never been connected to hobgoblins
[2025-11-02 02:28 PM] rsulfuratus: the only actual link has been the use of the Goblin language to speak to both hobgoblins and goblins, but that is trivial to retcon
[2025-11-02 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: in some sense, both bugbears and goblins make more sense as fey. my only hesitation there is that i kind of feel like they are more of a material plane species than a feywild species
[2025-11-02 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: there is also the name connection (hobgoblins / goblins). but goblins could be the name humans call them for some reason
[2025-11-02 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: Right that makes sense
[2025-11-02 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: We are going to see movie so afk for a while.
[2025-11-02 06:00 PM] Deciusmus: what if goblins were somehow fey banished to the material plane?
[2025-11-02 06:01 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a set of files for Orenlas rivers and also some minor renames of some kestavo gods (specifically the firebelow/cruel west wind) with some short metaphysics notes.
[2025-11-02 06:01 PM] Deciusmus: Both might come up in games this week, so a review of the check/tim there would be appreciated
[2025-11-02 06:02 PM] rsulfuratus: we are playing our family game right now but i'm going to do more stuff later tonight. 
    
    i actually kinda like the goblins are fey banished to the material plane
[2025-11-02 07:54 PM] Deciusmus: I think I kinda have a clear vibe of kobolds, but any notes you have to add to the existing page, which is pretty thin, would be great
[2025-11-02 07:54 PM] rsulfuratus: our game is over now so i'm going to clean up and check in with nathaniel and then do a bit of taelgar stuff
[2025-11-02 08:52 PM] rsulfuratus: on istaros names:
    Thalurien / Velurin / Lathirion all share a lot of similar sounds, especially the loo-reen / loo-re-en / ree - on ending. is this intentional? to me they feel a little to similar to be good names as it will be hard to keep them straight, but if the vibe is supposed to be "hard to keep them straight" it could work
[2025-11-02 08:53 PM] Deciusmus: it wasn't really intentional.
[2025-11-02 08:53 PM] rsulfuratus: i like Thalurien the best and it works with Taloraine which is a good isinguese name
[2025-11-02 08:53 PM] Deciusmus: probably Lathirion should change at least, I didn't love that one
[2025-11-02 08:53 PM] rsulfuratus: so i might tweak lathirion and maybe velurin too
[2025-11-02 08:53 PM] rsulfuratus: although velonere is also a good isinguese name
[2025-11-02 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: what about Velassë
[2025-11-02 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: veh-LAH-sseh
[2025-11-02 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i like that a lot
[2025-11-02 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: going to change and push
[2025-11-02 08:59 PM] rsulfuratus: agree lathirion also should change. as it is currently just in staging i'm just leaving check/name for now.
[2025-11-02 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: re: kestavo metaphysics. 
    
    i think that it is not belief that creates gods, but worship. while the old zimka might have believed in the zeyfa and the vaqar as entities, they didn't worship them; at best they placated them and at worse they cursed them. this kind of investiture of existence might have the power to create something - but definitely not a deity. 
    
    in the case of Zeyfa, this is complicated by the fact that the entities here actually exist, and are fey. and fey are not made of soulstuff. so in this case, mistaken believe is unlikely to matter at all. sometimes you are just wrong and even if you pretend with all your might that an archfey is a god, humanity cannot invest it with divine power. 
    
    my feeling - not canon - is that the existence of a real non-divine entity as the source of power forecloses the possibility of creating a divinity. i think this fits with the history of religion vibe where big gods usually grew out of little gods, not out of nothing. (though there remain some unanswered questions here)
[2025-11-02 09:08 PM] rsulfuratus: for Vaqar. specifically, i think that it might be possible that some demon lord styles themselves the fire-below and does get power of a kind from the belief in their existence, but it wouldn't be a deity in any sense. 
    
    and more likely, this is the same as the Zeyfa. just mistaken belief with no metaphysical consequences.
[2025-11-02 09:08 PM] rsulfuratus: put comments in obsidian to this effect
[2025-11-02 09:08 PM] rsulfuratus: leaving check/mike but can delete if this vibe makes sense to you
[2025-11-02 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: I like the vibe
[2025-11-02 09:10 PM] rsulfuratus: okay i'm deleting check/mike then on my next push. dropping a few goblinoid and kobold notes now
