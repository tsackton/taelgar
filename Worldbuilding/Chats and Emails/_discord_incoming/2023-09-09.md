# Discord DM – 2023-09-09

[2023-09-09 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: how did you use chat GPT for npc yaml?
[2023-09-09 05:50 PM] rsulfuratus: These are my instructions:
[2023-09-09 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: oops too long for discord
[2023-09-09 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: they are in _MOC/Metadata note in Obsidian
[2023-09-09 05:52 PM] rsulfuratus: https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/blob/main/_MoC/Metadata.md#instructions-for-chatgpt
[2023-09-09 05:52 PM] rsulfuratus: then I just paste in a bunch of my notes and it usually does a pretty good job pulling out the relevant information. I have to tell it the current date, and tell it when the party last saw it, and a few other little details
[2023-09-09 05:53 PM] rsulfuratus: I also have a note cleanup instruction set, here: https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/blob/main/_MoC/Metadata.md#reformat-note-instructions
[2023-09-09 05:53 PM] rsulfuratus: these could probably be refined a bit but worked pretty well when I was doing a bunch of NPC cleanup a few weeks ago
[2023-09-09 05:56 PM] Deciusmus: thanks
[2023-09-09 05:57 PM] Deciusmus: I went ahead with Twilight's Grace for now, because I hate having [[Untitled Fey Realm]] in Obsidian, but it won't come up in game so can be changed
