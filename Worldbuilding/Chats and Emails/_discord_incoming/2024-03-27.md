# Discord DM – 2024-03-27

[2024-03-27 01:37 PM] rsulfuratus: poking around a little bit in your Sembara notes thinking about a backstory for the cleric, and thinking about the Enst dynamic. Fellburn feels like it needs a good anchor that is not primarily economic to me
[2024-03-27 01:37 PM] Deciusmus: Yes. I was struggling with that a little bit
[2024-03-27 01:38 PM] Deciusmus: Why does Fellburn matter?
    
    I like the idea that pre-hobgoblin wars Rinburg was another major tradiing area, but post-war hasn't rebuilt the bridge for various reasons. But why does anyone live in Fellburn?
[2024-03-27 01:39 PM] Deciusmus: I was looking at big french cities in 1400 and pretty much they are all on bridges over rivers
[2024-03-27 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, although there are plenty of counterexamples (the Nile was not bridged for most of pre-modern history as far as I can tell)
[2024-03-27 01:42 PM] rsulfuratus: i think bridge/no bridge is easy to hand wave, perhaps for hydrological reasons if nothing else, but it means Fellburn needs a reason to exist that isn't "trade nexus"
[2024-03-27 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: Right I wasn’t super clear. What I mean is that looking at late medieval France “existence of a bridge” was a pretty good way to get an important city. Not to imply only way
[2024-03-27 01:43 PM] rsulfuratus: ah, right, sure
[2024-03-27 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: Dijon is the only main example I could find that didn’t have a significant bridge and it became large because of Italian trade fairs
[2024-03-27 01:44 PM] Deciusmus: Ie it was a convenient place for Italian and French merchants to meet
[2024-03-27 01:45 PM] rsulfuratus: I think from the existing Sembara notes, the puzzle is that you basically have this history of the Enst as sembaran borderlands, with all the major cities being sacked at one point or another, but also the vibe (perhaps not canon?) of Fellburn growing faster than Rinburg in recent times and expanding from a more minor city to bigger/more important than Rinburg
[2024-03-27 01:46 PM] Deciusmus: That vibe is definitely not canon
[2024-03-27 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: Rinburg is a natural economic powerhouse even absent bridge, given location at height of navigation and presence of major cermanic industry
[2024-03-27 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: so you can see the vibe of "even though the city was burned, it is a natural place to rebuild"
[2024-03-27 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: and the bridge is not economically important because most trade runs east-west not north-south
[2024-03-27 01:47 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-03-27 01:48 PM] rsulfuratus: I am not quite sure what the vibe of the small baronies between the Enst and Addermarch is supposed to be in the current day - this was all land that was essentially completely depopulated during hobgoblin wars
[2024-03-27 01:49 PM] Deciusmus: The only thing that matters about fellburn canonically is it needs a reason to be worth fighting for.  It has a big skeletal problem entirely because it was the site of several major battles including some sembaran defeats  so lots and lots of unburied dead all over.
[2024-03-27 01:49 PM] Deciusmus: Yeh I’ve been avoiding writing up Vahaiyas “how I came to be north of the Enst” story because I am not quite sure what the borderlands are like
[2024-03-27 01:50 PM] Deciusmus: I think it was an area of intense resettlement by Cece and a very specific attempt to have more barons directly dependent on the crown
[2024-03-27 01:51 PM] rsulfuratus: I have always thought of this land as relatively marginal
[2024-03-27 01:51 PM] rsulfuratus: trying to poke around for a good real-world parallel
[2024-03-27 01:52 PM] Deciusmus: A lot of court favorites getting land etc from the crown directly. But I’m not sure how that plays out later and I’m not committed to it
[2024-03-27 01:52 PM] Deciusmus: It can’t be that marginal if Wisford is the breadbasket of semabara and it’s just on the other side of the river
[2024-03-27 01:53 PM] Deciusmus: Although I guess it could be the wistel / north half of wisford that is extremely productive
[2024-03-27 01:53 PM] Deciusmus: And the Enst valley kinda marginal
[2024-03-27 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: so, thinking a bit more about the climate and topography. i think that there are hills / highlands along the southern border of Tyrwingha, the southern border of Addermarch, but then also wrapping around and extending north. you can see from the river topography that Addermarch is basically a bit of a basin inside the Mostreve Hills, which probably isolates it a bit and also means Addermarch looks downriver more than overland into Sembara
[2024-03-27 02:03 PM] rsulfuratus: this probably means the land slopes down from the mostreve hills to the enst, with more topological variation on the south side than the north side
[2024-03-27 02:04 PM] rsulfuratus: the actual Sembaran lowlands extend from the Enst to the Teft, but probably only stretch a little ways south of the Enst
[2024-03-27 02:05 PM] rsulfuratus: so in your Borderlands, Estrive/Monste/Vauclaire are probably good agricultural land, but everything south of that might not be
[2024-03-27 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: Right, that makes sense. So you have hilly terrain in the southern 2/3rds of the borderlands
[2024-03-27 02:09 PM] rsulfuratus: it might be something like Provence, but if you imagine that, for whatever reason, it is not suitable for vinticulture, you are left without much. animal husbandry and maybe some orchards
[2024-03-27 02:10 PM] rsulfuratus: or the southern applachas
[2024-03-27 02:10 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`appalachians
[2024-03-27 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: In the hobgoblin wars timeline, I have the Shattered Ice Clan basically settling the entire region 
    (a) north of the Mostreve Hills
    (b) south of the Enst
    (c) west of the Aure
    
    So Addermarch is on the southern border, and the entire borderlands and northern 1/3 of Maseau is under hobgoblin control for 45 years
[2024-03-27 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: Although I'm not sure if I really meant the Aure, as the rest of the history isn't that consistent with that
[2024-03-27 02:15 PM] rsulfuratus: so here is a random image of the Danube from the internet that maybe gets the Enst vibe a little bit:
![[../_discord_assets/img_61431bf1d71a7-22378.png]]
[2024-03-27 02:15 PM] rsulfuratus: why not the Aure?
[2024-03-27 02:16 PM] Deciusmus: Just that the history isn't consistent...
    
    - (DR:: 1602): The lands south of the Enst and west of the Aure are ceded to the hobgoblins. 
    (DR:: 1644), late fall/winter: The [[Shattered Ice Clan]] breaks the fortifications in [[Barony of Vaubonne|Vaubonne]] and camps outside [[Fellburn]]
[2024-03-27 02:17 PM] Deciusmus: if the land as far east as the Aure is under hobgoblin control, what are "the fortifications" in Vaubonne?
[2024-03-27 02:17 PM] Deciusmus: that would also be under hobgoblin control
[2024-03-27 02:17 PM] Deciusmus: Unless you imagine the 3rd hobgoblin war starts with a major sembaran success, which pushes the hobgoblins very far west, and then a collapse
[2024-03-27 02:18 PM] Deciusmus: But none of that history has to be canonical
[2024-03-27 02:18 PM] Deciusmus: it could actually work well for the entire area south of the Enst to be hobgoblin for 50 years
[2024-03-27 02:21 PM] rsulfuratus: I would probably make the Enst the de facto southern border of Sembara from 1602 - 161653
[2024-03-27 02:21 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`1653
[2024-03-27 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: Then you could imagine something like
    
    in the 1600s, you have Cleenseau and Rinburg both with bridges to hobgoblin terriority, and Cleenseau builds up an army, but Rinburg makes a go at economics, trading with the hobgoblins, etc
    
    Fellburn because the main garrison town and where the "cold war" with the hobgoblins is focused. 
    
    Then when the 3rd hobgoblin war breaks out, after some early successes Rinburg and Cleenseau are both occupied.
    
    But Fellburn, although it is sacked in 1647, is never really occupied. It is quickly retaken after the sack
[2024-03-27 02:22 PM] rsulfuratus: the only problem is the garrison at Fellburn would not then leave to fight in western Masseau
[2024-03-27 02:22 PM] rsulfuratus: so you have to change the early part of the 3rd hobgoblin war
[2024-03-27 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: - (DR:: 1644), fall: After several early successes, the Sembaran [[Army of the South]] is fought to a stalemate at the [[Battle of Lysandale]] in the western reaches of Maseau
[2024-03-27 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: yeah to make that work
[2024-03-27 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: but that could be the Dunfry garrison instead, the army of the west
[2024-03-27 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: You had some secret reason/idea behind why the hobgoblins started up again
[2024-03-27 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2024-03-27 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: But the flow of the war still works fine with the focus initially being a western campaign, focused on maseau, with the western army of sembara
[2024-03-27 02:24 PM] Deciusmus: and the southern army - based in fellburn - is defensive
[2024-03-27 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: I need to draw it out to visualize the territorial changes more clearly
[2024-03-27 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: something like:
    
    1600
![[../_discord_assets/image-BE8A8.png]]
[2024-03-27 02:26 PM] rsulfuratus: but getting back to Fellburn and the border baronies, I think this still leaves a slight puzzle, because Fellburn is not naturally positioned as a defensive location. so I think Fellburn should have something worth defending to motivate the garrison
[2024-03-27 02:27 PM] rsulfuratus: it is kind of a weird shape. why do the hobgoblins push so far west, especially if the border baronies are kind of marginal land?
[2024-03-27 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: 1645
![[../_discord_assets/image-E2176.png]]
[2024-03-27 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is less marginal than the northern third of Maseau, which is hill and also dry
[2024-03-27 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: But Sembara has the ability and will to defend the Enst, so isn't going to give up land north of the Enst. It is a strategic sacrifice on the Sembaran side to give up marginal land to avoid a bloody battle defending the Enst, which the hobgoblins take for similar reasons
[2024-03-27 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: Simiarly, the core of Maseau (the southern 1/3 or so where the land is better) is where almost all the people of Maseau live, so they are going to defend their homes to the death. But the northern parts are mostly empty, so easy for the hobgoblins to move in
[2024-03-27 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not entirely sure what is canon and what is speculation at this point, but why not have the hobgoblins move east instead of stretching their territory? at the end of the first hobgoblin war (more or less Sembaran victory) they are confined to what is quite marginal land in western Maseau and Enford; second hobgoblin war starts basically because the hobgoblins want better land, and is more-or-less a hobgoblin victory
[2024-03-27 02:32 PM] rsulfuratus: so at the end of 2nd war the hobgoblin territory is basically a crescent north + west of addermarch
[2024-03-27 02:32 PM] Deciusmus: the only bit that's canon is Cleenseau needs to be occupied by hobgoblins ~1645 - 1650 ish
[2024-03-27 02:34 PM] rsulfuratus: basically all that changes here is that perhaps there is something of a frozen conflict in western maseau (west of road, south of enford), where the land is not worth big effort and you have a bit of back and forth with maseau but semabara doesn't get involved, having driven hobgoblins south of enst
[2024-03-27 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: then initially 3rd hobgoblin war starts in the west, for mysterious reasons the hobgoblins launch a major offensive, sembara gets nervous about dunfry, and things procede
[2024-03-27 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: then I think you get the following vibes:
    - Cleanseau and Rinburg are economically central to the Enst river trade network, and despite occupation / destruction in the 1650 +/- spring back strong; it is possible that one or both actively trades with hobgoblins
    - Fellburn is an important city for cultural / religious / historical reasons despite being economically less vibrant than Rinburg, is better defended and seen as something that cannot be lost
    - Borderlands south of Enst are fully under hobgoblin rule; people remain in places, but as the Radiant Alliance closes in reprisals are pretty brutal and most structures are burned, so as of 1653 this is quite barren / unpopulated land
[2024-03-27 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: - Addermarch becomes very isolated from Sembara in this period, and draws much closer to Tyrwingha
[2024-03-27 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: (Addermarch has always felt more culturally connected to Tyrwingha anyway)
[2024-03-27 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: (I have a meeting so might be slow to respond)
[2024-03-27 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: So I think what this needs is just a good reason for Sembara to care about Fellburn and for a significant population center there. 
    
    One obvious option is a religious site. Sembara doesn't really have religious organizations per se so the site of an abbey or something probably doesn't work, but you could imagine almost a Bath-like vibe if Fellburn is the site of magical healing waters or something else magical and religious that would drive pilgrimages
[2024-03-27 03:01 PM] rsulfuratus: Another obvious option is a extraplanar weak point, which could have various and sundry impacts
[2024-03-27 03:04 PM] rsulfuratus: it feels like a magical explanation is correct here, and probably something that predates Drankor, which would potentially make Fellburn a very old area of settlement
[2024-03-27 03:26 PM] rsulfuratus: I am thinking that the cleric I'm making up is in his mid-50s, so his parents were probably born sometime between 1635-1645. i think that perhaps he has a family connection to Fellburn - his mother fled the sack of Fellburn when she was 10 or 12, or something like that
[2024-03-27 03:27 PM] rsulfuratus: still haven't figured out what he was doing before he found magic late in life, stay tuned
[2024-03-27 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: I think this is all good
[2024-03-27 03:36 PM] Deciusmus: So basically the hobgoblin wars timeline needs to change a little so that 
    early part of war is fighting in the west and large defensive buildup along the enst
    middle part of war is parts of the enst line collapse, but not all, and perhaps fellburn is never actually sacked and a valiant defense of fellburn holds out
    late part of war is pushing hobgoblins west
[2024-03-27 03:37 PM] Deciusmus: I like magical explanation for Fellburn being important; I am not sure I like magic healing waters as that is too similar to Isingue I think
[2024-03-27 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, just grabbing that as it is why Bath was an important place in the real world
[2024-03-27 03:39 PM] rsulfuratus: but playing on Fellburn, could be something like an eternal flame that magically burns and supposedly removes curses (maybe once an ancient kestavan site). or an oracle of some kind. perhaps kind of a strange oracle - not necessarily divine magic
[2024-03-27 03:40 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe a mythical defender - the phoenix of fellburn or something like that, although probably don't want an actual phoenix just hanging out in fellburn
[2024-03-27 03:41 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the key feature is something that drives pilgrimages which in turn drives the economy and growth of the city
[2024-03-27 03:41 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-03-27 03:49 PM] Deciusmus: A pushed a slight cleanup to timeline of Sembaran history to incorporate the above
[2024-03-27 03:50 PM] Deciusmus: Only bit I am not sure if is if Fellburn should actually be sacked, or if the hobgoblins are repelled. Probably depends on the nature of what is in Fellburn
[2024-03-27 03:50 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I'm trying to think of a good idea for that, need to let it simmer for a bit
[2024-03-27 06:25 PM] rsulfuratus: The Fell Burn, the Beacon of Fate in the ancient language of the original settlers of the Enst river valley, is a twisting crystalline structure, almost tree-like in form, perched on a rise above the Enst. For as long as anyone can remember, it has been said that, when the light of sunrise is reflected in its twists and turns, the crystals sing, in a language no one knows, but the song sings of hope, of comfort. those who make the pilgrimage in the night, and reach the crystals as the sun rises, say that they hear in the song the answers to doubts that have haunted them. 
    
    Before the Drankorians came, the songs were thought to be Kestavan songs, and the Fell Burn was a sacred place. 
    
    To the Drankorians, it was many things, and strange rumors spread. The most persistant was that, according to the Drankorian mages, it was a fragment of the moment of creation, frozen in time. The Drankorians built a fortification, and soon after a library, and it became a frequent site of travel and study, and the town of Fellburn grew. Many forgot the original meaning of Fellburn, and it acquired many names: the Singing Tree, in the colloquial, the Crystal of Time, among the wizards, and simply the Oracle of Hope to most. 
    
    After the Fall of Drankor, Fellburn persisted - in these days, much seemed dark, and many sought the hope and comfort of the Oracle. Some in these days thought it was a miracle of the Wyrdling, or perhaps the Sibyl, but the priests never claimed a divine presence. 
    
    As Sembara grew, Fellburn came to prosper. It was never the greatest economic powerhouse of the Enst, for the river was too wide here for a crossing, even in Drankorian days (or, the hills on either side too steep), and with no easy harbors it did not lend itself to a riverboat port. 
    
    But, the pilgrims always came, and with them coin, and so the city grew.
![[../_discord_assets/rsulfuratus_a_digital_fantasy_illustration-25069.png]]
[2024-03-27 06:26 PM] rsulfuratus: (picture is tentative)
[2024-03-27 06:29 PM] Deciusmus: I like that. Interestingly this is very close to the line of sunset in the fey wild.
[2024-03-27 06:31 PM] rsulfuratus: I was trying to make it very much not fey flavored - kind of thinking this is more of a mystery that shouldn't fit any obvious categories
[2024-03-27 06:31 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah it didn’t read as fey flavored - but it is kinda similar to the Sunset Gate thing I made up in a way
[2024-03-27 06:31 PM] rsulfuratus: right, okay
[2024-03-27 06:32 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe change the association with sunrise
[2024-03-27 06:32 PM] rsulfuratus: my thinking is also that this is basically indestructive
[2024-03-27 06:32 PM] Deciusmus: It sings when it will
[2024-03-27 06:32 PM] Deciusmus: Pilgrims sometimes wait days for it to sing
[2024-03-27 06:33 PM] Deciusmus: Sometimes it sings every hour. Sometimes it is a week
[2024-03-27 06:33 PM] rsulfuratus: I was going for the "hike up mt fuji at night to see the sunrise" vibe but yeah could be just sings when it sings, that might be better
[2024-03-27 06:33 PM] Deciusmus: I think the sunrise connection is going to make it seem fey once my players go to the sunset gate
[2024-03-27 06:34 PM] rsulfuratus: right. i actually like the unpredictability more
[2024-03-27 06:36 PM] rsulfuratus: so I was thinking it is indestructable and couldn't be sacked by the hobgoblins, and also ancient and pre-dates sembara, so probably Fellburn does get sacked, but is seen as a very significant loss out of proportion to its military significance (hobgoblins captured Oracle of Hope) so there is a lot of motivation to recaputre Fellburn
[2024-03-27 06:36 PM] Deciusmus: Right that works. The town is sacked but not occupied
[2024-03-27 06:37 PM] Deciusmus: Or only occupied briefly.
[2024-03-27 06:37 PM] Deciusmus: Do you have a some idea of what this really is or just random coolness?
[2024-03-27 06:38 PM] rsulfuratus: my best guess is the Drankorian wizards are correct, and it is a frozen piece of the Riving, but not committed to that
[2024-03-27 06:38 PM] rsulfuratus: my second guess is it could eventually tie into whatever the moon is
[2024-03-27 06:39 PM] rsulfuratus: (depending on whether you want it to be significant for your campaign / Igzil)
[2024-03-27 06:40 PM] Deciusmus: Hrm. I will ponder. I like the idea of this a lot though.
[2024-03-27 06:40 PM] Deciusmus: Are you envisioning it at the center of town? Or outside the town more in a separate space ?
[2024-03-27 06:40 PM] rsulfuratus: no, outside town
[2024-03-27 06:40 PM] rsulfuratus: not far outside town, like `<1 mile
[2024-03-27 06:41 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm thinking this part of the Enst is fairly hilly and so this stands on a rise of land above the river, and the town itself is in the valley
[2024-03-27 06:41 PM] Deciusmus: Right that works
[2024-03-27 06:44 PM] Deciusmus: How big are you envisioning it? Like 10 people at a time walking through it? 50?
[2024-03-27 06:45 PM] rsulfuratus: closer to 10 than 50. maybe a dozen?
[2024-03-27 06:46 PM] rsulfuratus: presumably there would be some kind of organizations associated with it, a guild or pilgrim's fund or something, that helps keep things organized
[2024-03-27 06:46 PM] Deciusmus: Also how do you feel about undead seeming to be terrified or repealed by it? I have no specific reason but I am sure this will come up soon in my game because the party wants to go see what’s going on with the siege of fellburn right after rinburg
[2024-03-27 06:46 PM] rsulfuratus: that would make perfect sense
[2024-03-27 06:47 PM] rsulfuratus: it is small enough it isn't really an effective shelter, but yes undead should avoid it
[2024-03-27 06:47 PM] Deciusmus: (In theory the session you would be npcing at would be part lake monster part roleplaying in fellburn— so having the cleric have some connection to fellburn is perfect he’d accompany the party onward and then stay in fellburn)
[2024-03-27 07:48 PM] rsulfuratus: basic outline of Armand backstory:
    - mother was from Fellburn, fled the sack (probably around 11-12) but was separated from her family, ended up in Embry, found her way onto a ship and became a sailor
    - father from local middle class Embry family, maybe a scribe or something
    - grew up with mostly absent mother, but always eager to hear stories of the sea, and her stories of Fellburn
    - as soon as he was old enough, left home to become a sailor, and traveled on merchant ships around the Green Sea
    - was a sailor for several decades, into his 40s or so
    - maybe 6-7 years ago, something happened; not sure exactly what yet, but something to do with undead that (a) triggered / opened his mind to latent divine magic and (b) left him deeply concerned with protecting the world from the wandering dead
    - returned to Embry and became an acolyte at temple of Night Queen, practicing magic and learning about undead
[2024-03-27 08:19 PM] Deciusmus: I like the basic outline. There is a bit of a vibe I have going with various night queen associated people having a sense of unease before the undead uprising. Perhaps that sense of unease made him leave Embry and go to the Oracle of Hope, So he was in the Enst river valley for Pyravella.
[2024-03-27 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe in Rinburg (or Fellburn).
[2024-03-27 08:21 PM] Deciusmus: Not sure how he joined up with Vahaiya and their crew though. It feels like if he was in either Rinburg or Fellburn at the time he would have gotten caught in in those events and wouldn’t be in Champimont now
[2024-03-27 08:22 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe he was in Rinburg when the first wave of undead rose, but at the time no one knew about the lake monster, so he immediately set out on the road to see how he could help. After all in many places it was just one or two zombies, which he’d usually be able to defeat himself.
[2024-03-27 08:23 PM] Deciusmus: He got caught up in the area around Eftly, where a big ghast-like creature devoured the town and literally met Vahaiya and their crew when they came to kill it
