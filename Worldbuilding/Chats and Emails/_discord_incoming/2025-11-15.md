# Discord DM – 2025-11-15

[2025-11-15 09:18 AM] Deciusmus: I was thinking about your language mechanics note a bit. I like the idea of leaning in even more on the well developed Taelgar linguistics model but it’s hard to see how to make it fun in play.  Advantage if you know the language in practice makes language very strong though unless the game is very travel oriented and so you are often encountering foreign lands
[2025-11-15 09:23 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah. it is a little tricky. i was thinking a bit about leaning hard into real-world medieval languages where since people don't travel much and there is no media you have tons and tons of minor languages, but then for game mechanics purposes you treat very broad groupings as 'basically understandable'
[2025-11-15 09:24 AM] rsulfuratus: the kind of Sembaran (Teft Valley) thing, where you only get advantage if you match the dialog
[2025-11-15 09:24 AM] rsulfuratus: but that requires a lot of DM investment to figure out who speaks what. and would still probably be too strong in relatively sedentary games
[2025-11-15 09:25 AM] rsulfuratus: it would have worked reasonably well in the dunmar game where none of you spoken native dunmari, but you traveled a lot
[2025-11-15 09:25 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah I think in my Cleenseau game it would in practice mean permanent advantage
[2025-11-15 09:26 AM] Deciusmus: Although maybe not actually
[2025-11-15 09:26 AM] Deciusmus: Given none of the PCs are actually from Cleenseau
[2025-11-15 09:26 AM] Deciusmus: It kinda gives a big boost to a local but maybe that actually makes sense in a way
[2025-11-15 09:27 AM] rsulfuratus: right i mean there is some logic in that if your group goes to Tyrwingha, Robin and Celyn would realistically often be recieved better by the locals if they spoke to them in Tyrwinghan / Tyrwinghan dialects of Sembaran
[2025-11-15 09:28 AM] rsulfuratus: i think where it gets a little complicated is it gives dwarves permanent advantage on interacting with other dwarves, etc, at least as non-human languages are currently constructed
[2025-11-15 09:29 AM] rsulfuratus: and if you have a party where one person is local to a region and the rest aren't, it would be pretty unbalanced
[2025-11-15 09:29 AM] Deciusmus: I actually think there is a bit of an argument that you should only get advantage on non-native tongue
[2025-11-15 09:30 AM] rsulfuratus: hmm that is interesting.  like the tourist who speaks french in paris vibe
[2025-11-15 09:30 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2025-11-15 09:30 AM] Deciusmus: I also saw some ideas on the internet of treating language as also a cultural knowledge skill
[2025-11-15 09:31 AM] Deciusmus: Ie having Tyrwinghan language means you know something about Tyrwinghan culture and traditions.
[2025-11-15 09:31 AM] Deciusmus: But actually part of the challenge is that it kinda runs against the weakness of the D&D skill system in general
[2025-11-15 09:35 AM] rsulfuratus: to some extent, sure, but i also think the basic d20 system is very flexible
[2025-11-15 09:37 AM] rsulfuratus: it is just on the character building side there isn't a lot of ways to capture kind of flexible background stuff really
[2025-11-15 09:37 AM] Deciusmus: Well yeah that’s what I mean. The basic mechanic of stat plus some bonus roll against a dc is kinda fine
[2025-11-15 09:40 AM] rsulfuratus: for your group that might be a limitation but i think for the taelgar group a more complicated skill ruleset would be challenging. for campaign 3 i've been thinking about trying to actually step away a little from skills, and lean a little more into something akin to the variant rule from the 2014 rules that was something like "background proficiency" where you can add your proficiency bonus to a check if it fits your background even if you aren't proficient with the relevant skill
[2025-11-15 09:43 AM] rsulfuratus: there are obviously some parts of the rules that still interact with standard proficiencies - things like reliable talent and a few other things - but fundamentally the d20 system can be:
    Player: I want to do X
    DM: okay, make a Dex check, are you proficient in anything that would help?
    Player: yes, Y
    DM: okay, add prof bonus
    
    although obviously it wouldnt always need a discussion if the connection was obvious
[2025-11-15 09:44 AM] rsulfuratus: for our group anyway no one is trying to powergame their background so it's just a nice bonus when something relevant comes up and i'm not sure it needs more complicated rules. 
    
    i was trying to fit languages into that kind of idea
[2025-11-15 09:46 AM] rsulfuratus: although there are also ways that language could interact with the Influence action and the hostile/indifferent/friendly vibe.
[2025-11-15 09:53 AM] Deciusmus: I think the idea of more flexible prof bonuses works well for a lot of reasons but I also think skills provide a valuable way for a character to be good at something like persuasion or perception
[2025-11-15 09:54 AM] Deciusmus: Or arcane knowledge
[2025-11-15 09:54 AM] rsulfuratus: right, i don't think totally abandoning skills is better. more like using flexible prof bonuses like your competencies, just not writing it down and formalizing it into another set of character creation rules
[2025-11-15 09:54 AM] Deciusmus: Right
[2025-11-15 09:56 AM] Deciusmus: Charli is taking the ssat and Dana and are going to do a crossword and take a walk but I have some more ideas I’ll share later
[2025-11-15 11:43 AM] Deciusmus: So getting away from the general idea of background skills or other skill system tweaks, and thinking about languages some more.
    
    The general challenge with languages in play is that it is tricky to make not knowing the local language fun (which is where "common" comes in).  It is very appealing color and worldbuilding, and it makes the world feel more realistic and interesting, but in actual play it can be hard to structure a good experience.
[2025-11-15 11:47 AM] Deciusmus: I ran into some mild frustration in play with Delwath, for example, where a major secondary appeal of the character was features like high persuasion and scyring, so it felt like there was kind of a tax on character growth because I had to always worry about languages.
    
    The elven ritual refactor we did to give comprehend langauges as a ritual helped solve that, but I think there is a general problem with languages in that certain characters want to be built around face or spy type skills, and it feels unfun to be playing that type of character and find you can't do your skill a bunch of the time because you don't speak the language
[2025-11-15 11:47 AM] Deciusmus: On the other hand, the idea of the party is in some small village and no one speaks the language has potential to be fun. It just doesn't work for all storieis - if the reason you are in the small village is to get information, for example, it just feels kinda frustrating if it is impossible to do so
[2025-11-15 11:48 AM] Deciusmus: On the third hand, that can sorta be hand-waved, i.e. with Ursk where basically we declared we all learned the language in the three weeks of travel leading up
[2025-11-15 11:49 AM] Deciusmus: I think ultimately the problem with languages in D&D is there are not good ways to reflect
    (a) learning enough to communicate quickly
    (b) an ability to invest in a talent to make it easier or possible to learn many languages (i.e. for a face character)
    (c) some benefit (or penalty, but that might be less fun) for actually learning the language
[2025-11-15 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus: right - i think what i tend to lean towards is rewarding investment while making basic communication possible. 
    
    this is in part why i was messing around with language fluency kind of ideas too
[2025-11-15 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus: especially the way we play d&d, the basic idea of not being able to talk to people is a little annoying, although tongues kinda solves this
[2025-11-15 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus: but if you can talk to everybody seemlessly, there isn't really a point in having language proficiencies at all. a simple way to deal with it would be just to make languages a worldbuilding thing and hand wave adventurers can just speak to everybody more or less
[2025-11-15 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus: so i kind of go around in circles between  just hand wave it and make it never matter and character choices should matter
[2025-11-15 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus: the other option i played with is to actually just remove trade languages from the worldbuilding entirely, and consider common to be a game mechanic only, a special language that PCs know that is basically a semi-magical ability to communicate at a basic level with all humans (+ maybe the common non-humans)
[2025-11-15 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus: (or maybe leave them but separate them from the game mechanic of "Common")
[2025-11-15 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus: this is more how like the Tolkien universe works
[2025-11-15 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus: there is a lot of language development but almost never in the books does it prevent people from talking to each other
[2025-11-15 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus: but then i think you'd want something to make language choices meaningful too
[2025-11-15 12:01 PM] Deciusmus: I think the right answer is closer to an ability to learn languages quickly to a basic level
[2025-11-15 12:02 PM] Deciusmus: Plus perhaps a skill like Languages that lets you roll to speak any non-magical language to a basic level
[2025-11-15 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not sure how that is different in practice in game though. i guess it is slightly different in the sense that it if you are dropped into a distant land unprepared you are worse off than with the 'common is magic' approach
[2025-11-15 12:03 PM] Deciusmus: So imagine something like the following:
    
    every language has three levels-
    Broken
    Fluent
    Native
    
    Any pc can learn any language to broken level with 2 weeks of downtime and a teacher.
[2025-11-15 12:04 PM] Deciusmus: Plus there is a skill, Languages, which lets you roll to speak to most creatures on the spot.
[2025-11-15 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus: i like the basic idea but it feels too rules heavy for our group
[2025-11-15 12:04 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe…
[2025-11-15 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess i was just thinking to more or less subsume those abilities into "Language Proficiency: Common"
[2025-11-15 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus: tracking languages is not really that hard it is just writing down something on a character sheet, so having broken, fluent, native or something might not be too bad, although then you need to actually remember to use it in play
[2025-11-15 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus: but i think adding another skill is too complicated and ends up being a skill tax on face characters
[2025-11-15 12:07 PM] Deciusmus: I guess I was aiming for a system where:
    
    (a) it is possible for there to be communication barriers as for a single scene or two, I think it can be fun
    (b) it is easy to pick up new languages so after the initial scene it is easy to hand wave and say “everyone knows enough Ursk to talk now”
    (c) there is some benefit for players/characters who want to invest in being better at languages
[2025-11-15 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus: right i guess point (c) gets back to the general D&D issue where once you pick your skills, for most classes that's it, you don't really ever gain more, unless you invest a feat which is a very high price to pay
[2025-11-15 12:08 PM] Deciusmus: A rules light way to do that just gives up on (c) and effectively allows any pc to learn any language with an in game justification
[2025-11-15 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus: one other thing i was thinking about actually that ties into the background proficiency thing for campaign 3 was just having everybody write one or two FATE-like "my character is good at X because Y" into their backstory. and then just try to use that a little more in game, to try to encourage a little more role playing instead of plot-metagaming
[2025-11-15 12:11 PM] Deciusmus: But there is also appeal in weird old magic languages (sylvan, Drankorian). One challenge in D&D is there isn’t a good pool of things to spend “points” on, so someone who wants to be able to speak a bunch of dead or rare languages doesn’t really have a way to do it
[2025-11-15 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus: so i think that might be a rules-light way to encourage something, if you want to be a scholar of old tongues that's one of your "background knowledge". kind of like how seeker was good at geology and wellby maps - but kenzo and delwath and riswynn never really had a kind of hook like that
[2025-11-15 12:15 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I wonder if there would be a mechanic like:
    
    you start the game with 3 sentences - I am good at X because Y
    
    But then at 6th, 12th, and 18th level you can add
    
    I’ve become an expert in X because Y
    
    Which provides for some level of character growth
[2025-11-15 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i like that
[2025-11-15 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: And then most languages are just hand waved
[2025-11-15 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: Although probably with a mechanic that you’d have to take a bit of time to learn
[2025-11-15 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: An unfamiliar language -
[2025-11-15 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: And that some languages are pretty hard to learn
[2025-11-15 12:18 PM] Deciusmus: The downside of that is that it invalidates a lot of existing spells, etc.
[2025-11-15 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus: so i think i would add a couple of tweaks
    - it might still be useful to keep some concept of broken/fluent/native. then you could consider something like tongues to give you native fluency (so if you can cast in where people can't see you, you can pass as local)
    - perhaps the handwaving doesn't extend to reading/writing at all, which keeps comprehend languages useful (or picking something like "I'm good at deciphering unknown writing because of my days as a student of rheotric at the university of tollen")
    - then i
[2025-11-15 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus: - then i'd wrap the "quick learning to broken, make yourself understood with a check" into proficiency with Common
[2025-11-15 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus: but i think the general idea that even if it can be good to have some situations where you are stuck in a foreign place, it is kind of frustrating if you (a) literally have no ability to communicate unless you picked the right language at character creation, and (b) language trouble goes on for multiple sessions
[2025-11-15 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2025-11-15 12:26 PM] Deciusmus: So if you had the idea that said:
    
    - native tongue gives you advantage on cha checks as a foreigner 
    - tongues gives you native fluency 
    
    It becomes a much more appealing spell and feels less like a tax
[2025-11-15 12:27 PM] Deciusmus: I also like the idea that “broken” doesn’t let you read or write and is given out very easily.
[2025-11-15 12:27 PM] Deciusmus: You could even imagine a meta-rule that says if you spend a session interacting with npcs you gain broken prof with their language
[2025-11-15 12:28 PM] Deciusmus: Potentially, broken could give disadvantage on influence checks.
[2025-11-15 12:29 PM] Deciusmus: That would mean face characters are invested in getting languages but a non-face doesn’t really care unless they are trying to make influence checks
[2025-11-15 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus: right - although it doesn't need to be a hard and fast rule. some people could be hostile to foreigners, for example
[2025-11-15 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean fundamentally i think the basic idea that you shouldn't need to invest in languages just to be able to role play talking to people in a strange town, but you might need to invest in languages if you want to convince indifferent or hostile NPCs to do things, is probably the right overall picture
[2025-11-15 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah although if people are investing in languages it is better if the rules are a bit predictable.
[2025-11-15 02:09 PM] Deciusmus: I'm mucking around with ideas some more. One of the challenges with "background proficiencies" is it isn't very clear how it is meant to interact with regular proficiencies.
    
    I grew up in Tollen as an orphan, and learned to survive by my charm and quick-wit. I am good at convincing people to help me and deflecting blame.
    
    How is that difference from "I'm proficient in Persuasion (or persuasion and deception)"
    
    I mean, it kinda is, but there is this tricky line to thread about how it all works in play.
[2025-11-15 02:16 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, i think there is an inherent tension between having a well-defined way things work in play, and having things be rules light / mechanics light
[2025-11-15 02:17 PM] rsulfuratus: i kind of prefer to design more mechanics-oriented things, but if they are intended to be player-facing i'm dubious about how much value they'll add to our specific table
[2025-11-15 02:18 PM] Deciusmus: I'd put it differently, which is to say that Mechanics are fine, but long lists of things to choose from are a bad fit
[2025-11-15 02:19 PM] Deciusmus: At some level, the entire skill system is just
    
    * How do you decide if you add your proficiency bonus to this check
[2025-11-15 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: Right
[2025-11-15 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: In a way, you could imagine a system where there are ONLY background proficiencies, and no skills at all. 
    
    But there are a couple of things that don't quite fit that... Stealth, Perception, Athletics, Insight, maybe Arcana, maybe Persuasion
[2025-11-15 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: I actually think that a system where there is a small number of "actions" you can take, that are explicitly their own thing (like Initiative) and then just a neblous "be creative about what your character knows and can do" actually works a lot better for a rules light system than trying to layer a rules light system on top of the existing skill proficiencies
[2025-11-15 02:26 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess my vague thinking is that there are some advantages to having two separate “proficiency systems” that operate side by side
[2025-11-15 02:27 PM] rsulfuratus: Still thinking it through but there is sometimes a tension between mechanical effectiveness and background story, in a vague way
[2025-11-15 02:27 PM] rsulfuratus: So for example if you just have background proficiencies, things like perception or persuasion feel like they force you to a certain backstory
[2025-11-15 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: Yes, although I'm not sure if that necessarily applies to Religion, Animal Handling, or Medicine, say
[2025-11-15 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: Part of it is that different skills have wildly varying mechanical benefits.
    
    Insight, Perception, Persuasion, Stealth, Athletics, Acrobatics, knowledge skills (particular Arcana) are much much more useful than any other skill in most situations
[2025-11-15 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: So maybe you have something like
    
    Animal Handling
    Athletics
    Arcana
    Perception
    Insight
    Persuasion
    Stealth
    Sleight of Hand
    Survival
    
    as the only skills
[2025-11-15 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: You could also imagine adding a few that don't exist in D&D.
    
    Gather Information
    Languages
[2025-11-15 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: (We are driving to Eric’s and I have to occasionally give Kate directions)
[2025-11-15 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: See, my feeling is rewriting the skill system is not worth the effort
[2025-11-15 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: Then, you could image doing something like.
    
    `**`Narrative Proficiency**. A narrative proficiency is a single sentence of the form "My character is good at X because Y" or "My character knows about X because of Y".  When making an ability check, a narrative proficiency allows you to add your proficiency bonus to relevant checks.
    
    `**`Background**. Your background grants you one skill proficiency and two narrative proficiencies.
    
    `**`Class**.  Most classes grant a single narrative proficiency of the form (when becoming a Class I became good at Y or I learned a lot about Y). Some may grant zero, and others two. Classes also typically grant a single skill proficiency. Some grant more.
    
    `**`Languages**. You can replace a single narrative proficiency from your background or class with 5 language points.
    
    `**`Tools**. You can replace a single narrative proficiency from your background or class with 3 tool proficiencies.
[2025-11-15 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: `**`Gaining Levels**. At 3rd, 9th, and 15th levels you gain an additional narrative proficiency of the form "I've become good at X during my adventures" or "I've learned a lot about X during my adventures"
[2025-11-15 02:46 PM] rsulfuratus: So I like the basic vibe but I don’t think it needs to be codified in quite such a mechanical way
[2025-11-15 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: I dunno, maybe it is a bit too complicated. But I think it is very hard to "layer in" the core idea of "writing a sentence about your background lets you do stuff"
[2025-11-15 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess I don’t quite see why?
[2025-11-15 02:50 PM] rsulfuratus: I mean it is maybe more things to remember so it might not work. But the basic vibe of just saying “does this narrative fact fit here” when you make a check doesn’t seem hard?
[2025-11-15 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: Right, that isn't the issue. It is more about party roles and good vs bad backgrounds.
[2025-11-15 02:52 PM] Deciusmus: Stealth and Perception are good examples.
    
    It seems like there is a benefit to saying something like: A Perception check, like an Initiative check, is a specific game mechanic. You can't be good at it because you said in your background that you are a really observant kid
[2025-11-15 02:55 PM] rsulfuratus: Sure. I guess I see that more as a dm thing. Like there is some judgement for what makes a good narrative background sentence type thing
[2025-11-15 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: And there is still a question about whether anyone would remember to use it
[2025-11-15 02:56 PM] Deciusmus: Honestly, three is maybe too many. It might work better with one from background and one from class and new ones as you level.
[2025-11-15 02:57 PM] Deciusmus: I think to remember about it, it has to tie into core conceptions of your character more than random side-fluff
[2025-11-15 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: But I also think skills in D&D are kinda broken, because ultimately I think in Dunmari Frontier we didn't use that many skills.
    
    Like, the most memorable things were
    
    Delwath persuading
    Kenzo insighting and stealthing
    Wellby animal handling and stealthing and perceiving
    Seeker knowing weird arcane stuff
    
    I barely remember any proficiency checks other than Persuasion, Perception, Insight, Stealth, Animal Handling, and Arcana.
    
    Then there were lots of times where it was more of a "make roll" with a creative vibe for what skill applied.
    
    I think narrative proficiencies work really well for the latter type of thing
[2025-11-15 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: And I think as a player there are two very different experiences...
    
    one is the "make a perception check" experience. It is a specific game action that you are making to achieve an outcome (find something hidden). In this case, there isn't really any creativity - your goal is to hide or see something or persuade someone to do something (although this is a bit of a grey area).
    
    the other is the "solve a problem" experience. You are faced with a game situation and need to figure out how to solve it.  It is easy in this situation to get into a kinda boring loop of looking at your spells and skills to see how one of them could apply. But it is a perfect situation for "narrative proficiency" and having 3-5 sentences about what your character is good at is just as easy to browse as what skills you are proficient in
[2025-11-15 03:05 PM] rsulfuratus: I actually think the new search, study, influence actions are maybe useful here
[2025-11-15 03:05 PM] rsulfuratus: The “game action” thing you describe is almost always one of those three
[2025-11-15 03:06 PM] Deciusmus: Yes
[2025-11-15 03:07 PM] rsulfuratus: Plus hide
[2025-11-15 03:09 PM] Deciusmus: Yes, and with Athletics/Acrobatics and the grappling rules an asterisk but similar
[2025-11-15 03:09 PM] Deciusmus: and another asterisk around disarming traps and picking pockets and the like
[2025-11-15 03:13 PM] Deciusmus: But this is kinda where I was going with a minimal skill list. 
    
    You can imagine skills are just:
    
    Hide
    Influence: People (= persuasion)
    Influence: Animals (= animal handling)
    Search: People (=insight)
    Search: World (=perception)
    Athletics (= acrobatics or athletics)
    Sleight of Hand (= disarming traps/picking pockets)
    
    that doesn't cover study. But it goes back to saying that there are a set of game actions, and you can, as a character, be particularly good at them.
    
    And then there is the non-game action stuff, which is anytime you are making an ability check for some other purpose, and that's just all narrative
[2025-11-15 03:16 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess I think of it like - there are two things you can do with skills. You can take game actions, where narrative stuff doesn’t apply, and you can just do general solve problems things where both skills and narrative apply
[2025-11-15 03:17 PM] rsulfuratus: If you want to be good at game actions you take the appropriate skills; I think it is okay if everything is not perfectly even
[2025-11-15 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: Right, but that's where I think the in-play (especially the Taelgar group) experience actually benefits from less-is-more
[2025-11-15 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: We are at Eric’s so more later. These short adventures are a good time to test things like this to see if people like it
[2025-11-15 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2025-11-15 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a long doc - narrative proficiencies
[2025-11-15 06:39 PM] Deciusmus: It’s a big refactor. I think it has promise but might be too much change.
[2025-11-15 07:36 PM] rsulfuratus: just took a brief look. to the extent i'm doing any dnd stuff tonight it is mostly not this, but i guess i'm still not quite clear what problem reducing the number of skills and recombining them into a new list is trying to solve
[2025-11-15 07:49 PM] Deciusmus: We are about to watch a movie so I’m not really looking at dnd. I think the skill change is mostly about making skills better. The problem it is solving is that the dnd skill list is not really that good and in particular a lot of “flavor” skills (medicine, survival) and knowledge skills are duplicative of narrative proficiency. 
    
    There is no harm in having both per se, but by making the skill list smaller and tighter and the number of skills much smaller it is easier to remember what your character is good at
[2025-11-15 07:51 PM] rsulfuratus: will have to think about it a bit. not sure i agree, but working now on the oakstrides while kate does some sunday school prep so not going to dive further into rules stuff.
[2025-11-15 10:50 PM] Deciusmus: I think it’s mostly about what the DM says. What I mean is-
    
    If the DM says - make a Persuasion check - most people will just make a persuasion check. 
    
    If the DM says - make a Charisma check - (esp if they add “with prof, if you have a background) - it is a lot easier to open the door to - can is my X relevant
[2025-11-15 10:51 PM] Deciusmus: But reducing the skill list makes it easier to distinguish those scenarios
[2025-11-15 10:56 PM] Deciusmus: Of course it isn’t strictly necessary to change the rules. A DM could just say-  when you try to do something I will ask for one of:
    
    Persuasion
    Perception 
    Insight
    Stealth
    Athletics
    Animal Handling
    Investigation
    
    Or, an ability check. 
    
    If I ask for an ability check, if some skill or narrative proficiency would apply, you can add your proficiency bonus.
[2025-11-15 10:58 PM] Deciusmus: But if that’s how the game is going to run, then it might feel nicer from a character building perspective to focus skill proficiencies on actual skills the DM is going to ask for, rather than effectively “boring” narrative proficiencies
[2025-11-15 11:02 PM] Deciusmus: But if the DM says hrm, to determine if this ice cave was carved make a  nature check rather than make an Int check. It to me at least feels less likely someone will contradict the assignment of “nature skill” to the check. But if the dm says make an int check, it feels like it is leaving the door open to say “well my character spent her formative years exploring the winter landscapes of Northern zimkova”
[2025-11-15 11:05 PM] rsulfuratus: I am dubious that the problems of just running skills as written are big enough to be worth the hassle of a pretty major rewrite. I think languages are more fertile ground because of the tension between worldbuilding and game feel at the table, and because there are minimal rules around them anyway. Adding on something is a lot easier that a major rewrite
[2025-11-15 11:07 PM] rsulfuratus: Especially because what you are talking about is really a table culture thing not a rules thing anyway. Nothing is stopping a player from asking to add prof to a check even if the dm asks for a nature check
[2025-11-15 11:08 PM] Deciusmus: I actually don’t think there is a huge downside to skills as written
[2025-11-15 11:09 PM] Deciusmus: However i do think the introduction of something like narrative proficiencies will fizzle without moving away from a “skill-centric” conception of ability checks
[2025-11-15 11:12 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah, agreed. But I think it is really a table culture thing about getting people to think a little less passively about ability checks, which is not necessarily an easy thing to change but is where I would likely focus effort for campaign 3
[2025-11-15 11:13 PM] rsulfuratus: I think a bit skill rewrite probably makes it harder because it will take everyone a long while to conceptualize a new system
[2025-11-15 11:13 PM] Deciusmus: I actually think as a player there is a huge difference between:
    
    Make a Nature check and
    Make an Intelligence check
[2025-11-15 11:13 PM] rsulfuratus: Well not according to the rules
[2025-11-15 11:14 PM] rsulfuratus: Which is why every published module writes Intelligence (History) not History
[2025-11-15 11:15 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah but I don’t think you as a dm have ever said make an Intelligence (Arcana) check
[2025-11-15 11:15 PM] rsulfuratus: Right because it’s kind of a pain. But that is part of changing table culture around skills
[2025-11-15 11:15 PM] Deciusmus: It’s generally either …
    
    Make an arcana check or
    Hrm.. do you have a relevant skill?
[2025-11-15 11:16 PM] Deciusmus: But I’m saying it isn’t table culture. It’s DM-led
[2025-11-15 11:16 PM] rsulfuratus: Well; I mostly don’t do that because 1/2 - 3/5 of the group don’t understand what an ability check is or how to roll one on D&D beyond
[2025-11-15 11:17 PM] Deciusmus: Right but I think that’s kinda backwards. No one knows what skills they have either.
[2025-11-15 11:17 PM] rsulfuratus: At least half the time I did that certain people would just roll a save
[2025-11-15 11:17 PM] Deciusmus: It’s just easy to find a specific skill.
[2025-11-15 11:17 PM] rsulfuratus: Which is largely a D&D beyond UI issue to be fair
[2025-11-15 11:18 PM] Deciusmus: Yes
[2025-11-15 11:19 PM] Deciusmus: Anyway i need to go to bed. My only point is i think that the whole concept of (skills, ability checks, narrative skills) is actually fairly interlinked and just trying to say, add more free form stuff on its own won’t really work
[2025-11-15 11:19 PM] Deciusmus: I will also add that I think the skill system is by far the worst part of D&D (except for tools, which are even worse)
[2025-11-15 11:20 PM] rsulfuratus: I agree but I think it is more about trying to rearrange information rather than a big rules rewrite
