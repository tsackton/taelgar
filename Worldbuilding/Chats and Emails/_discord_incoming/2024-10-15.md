[2024-10-15 11:53 AM] Deciusmus: I haven't published my taelgarverse in a while, but am getting an error:
    
        raise ConstructorError(None, None,
    yaml.constructor.ConstructorError: could not determine a constructor for the tag '![[simon-of-cranford.png]]'
      in "`<unicode string>`", line 7, column 8:
        image: ![[simon-of-cranford.png]]
[2024-10-15 11:53 AM] Deciusmus: any ideas?
[2024-10-15 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus: what's the note?
[2024-10-15 12:13 PM] Deciusmus: Simon of Cranford
[2024-10-15 12:14 PM] Deciusmus: removing image: ![[simon-of-cranford.png]] fixed it
[2024-10-15 12:14 PM] Deciusmus: but I'm not sure why that one note had a problem for me and not you
[2024-10-15 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus: I haven't published in a while either
[2024-10-15 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus: the problem is that `!` is a reserved character in yaml
[2024-10-15 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus: so the python yaml module is trying to figure out how to generate a tag [[simon-of-cranford.png]] but can
[2024-10-15 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus: changing it to:
    image: "![[simon-of-cranford.png]]" probably would also work
[2024-10-15 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus: but as far as I can see most other notes just use `image: filename.png` so unclear what is being accomplished by using the markdown linking format in yaml
[2024-10-15 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: Nothing
[2024-10-15 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: The note is wrong
[2024-10-15 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: It was probably just a cut and paste error and I meant to have image; filename
[2024-10-15 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus: I pushed a Lord Serenveil page fyi
[2024-10-15 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: your house rules file in Campaigns\Mechanics conflicts with my house rule file in Campaigns\Cleenseau\Mechanics\House Rules
[2024-10-15 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: can I move yours to Dunmar Frontier or something? I guess you want to potentially use it for different campaigns
[2024-10-15 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: ?
    What if I renamed to House Rules (Tim) and House Rules (Mike) and then fixed in the TOC?
[2024-10-15 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: in the website build side?
