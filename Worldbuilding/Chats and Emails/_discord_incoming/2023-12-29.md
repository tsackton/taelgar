# Discord DM – 2023-12-29

[2023-12-29 10:20 AM] Deciusmus: I’m moving on from feywild to the sembaran impacts of the “undead plague” that’s happening right now in 1720. I might tweak some borders and sizes of baronies, I assume you aren’t committed to anything specific here
[2023-12-29 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus: Not committed to anything specific re: semabaran borders
[2023-12-29 01:53 PM] rsulfuratus: I like the Sunset Gate a lot
[2023-12-29 01:54 PM] rsulfuratus: Sharpshire is good for the ruined fey kingdom
[2023-12-29 01:55 PM] rsulfuratus: Not really hugely a fan of any of the beast names. Also, what were the imagined borders of this place? This is overlapping the bulk of Sembara?
[2023-12-29 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: I didn’t love those names either. As far as the place I imagine it more overlapping with highland kingdoms and eastern sembara. Western sembara is probably allies of Ethlenn or something
[2023-12-29 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: Oops, reverse that. Western sembara
[2023-12-29 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: So from west to east the fey realms in sembara are:
    Far west - remains of Sharpspire north of that animal-place
    Then Duskmire, again with the animalplace north of it.
[2023-12-29 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: Then the sunset gate - outside any particular realm - with undetermined realm north of that.
    The.
[2023-12-29 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: Then twilights Grace
[2023-12-29 02:57 PM] Deciusmus: When I’m back at my computer I’ll send a map
[2023-12-29 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: But at a high level I’m envisioning a animal fey kingdom over the highlands, bordering Duskmire to the north, and something else over Embry / heartlands, north of sunset gate and the various “non-realm” ethlenn allies
[2023-12-29 03:43 PM] rsulfuratus: is the animal place relevant to duskmire? or just an idea for something that could be north of duskmire and would prevent duskmire from expanding?
[2023-12-29 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: Just an idea
[2023-12-29 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: I liked the idea of a fey place that is focused on talking animals and such
[2023-12-29 09:53 PM] Deciusmus: Basically what I was thinking was this:
![[../_discord_assets/feywild-55EAA.png]]
[2023-12-29 09:57 PM] Deciusmus: where:
    D = Duskmire
    S = Sharpspire, now a dangerous mystery
    Orange line = Sunset Gate
    A = small allied fey to Ethlynn but not part of any realm
    B = nature/beast place
    
    Although the exact line between A and B is a bit random, and B is a bit undefined
