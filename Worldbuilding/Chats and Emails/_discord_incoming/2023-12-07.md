# Discord DM – 2023-12-07

[2023-12-07 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus: added a few more status tags:
    - `**`status/mike**, `**`status/tim**: this note needs a quick review from whoever (probably) created it to make sure tags and frontmatter are correct (used primarily for, e.g., deleting status/unknown from notes that appear complete but might have non-Obsidian information to add, or for adding dates/organizations/whereabouts/other information to pages you are pretty sure but not certain of)
    - **status/images** for pages that might benefit from additional of some images or descriptive text
[2023-12-07 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus: trying to clean up status/unknown; if I am not sure about correct tag will change to status/mike, for example, instead of leaving status/unknown
[2023-12-07 01:13 PM] rsulfuratus: doing a bit of work on Dunmar notes while I eat lunch and increasingly clear I think that political and geographic notes don't quite intersect completely into a proper folder hierachy. 
    
    i'm doing a test rearrangement of Central Lowlands to separate political units and geographic units
    
    I'm actually not convinced the entire of regions is even quite correct but for now not messing with that
[2023-12-07 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: I was wondering if it would make sense to change the metadata a bit. Specifically I think we care about 3 things:
    - where the thing is in space (whereabouts, special rules about home vs away, chains)
    - relationships (many to many, no chain)
    - part of (one to many, chains)
[2023-12-07 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: Imagine you had a page Dunmar that was both a type place and type polity
[2023-12-07 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: Then you could say it is whereabouts is central lowland region and it’s part of nothing. Some town (Karawa) could in theory then have a whereabouts of (plains of Karawa) and a part of (Dunmar)
[2023-12-07 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: It models things well and if part of could be dated handles a lot of cases around changes in political situation pretty well.
[2023-12-07 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: But it means it isn’t clear what you do with a whereabouts chain - do you follow whereabouts exclusively (which might often by not really what you want)?
[2023-12-07 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: Or do you always prefer part of?
[2023-12-07 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: The western Cymea case suggests you’d like to prefer whereabouts
[2023-12-07 02:53 PM] rsulfuratus: the complicated answer would be to have a filter string that controls this. I think you'd acutally generally prefer partOf but there are a few places where you'd likely prefer to follow whereabouts
[2023-12-07 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. for Dunmar - which I'm working on the geography of - you don't want "Karawa, Dunmari Basin, Central Lowlands Region" you want "Karawa, Eastern Dunmar, Dunmar"
[2023-12-07 03:47 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, its almost like you want something in the filter string
[2023-12-07 03:47 PM] Deciusmus: for which to prefer
[2023-12-07 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: BTW, what is the right status for "Worldbuilding" stuff?
[2023-12-07 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: I kinda feel like everything in Worldbuliding\Brainstorming should just not have a status tag
[2023-12-07 03:49 PM] Deciusmus: + WorldBuilding\High School notes
[2023-12-07 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: Thinking more about collaboration on status tags, I’d sort of prefer to keep it as:
    
    status/needswork
    status/factcheck
    status/mike
    status/tim
    status/stub
    
    Where needswork has a bunch of sub categories, means still under some kind of active work or needs active work. 
    
    Fact check means there are things to confirm but they are facts elsewhere in Obsidian (session notes, etc) and so anyone can check them and remove the tag
    
    Stub means this page probably only needs a header but whoever created the page or updated the status didn’t feel like filing in the details. Anyone who fills in header can remove tag
[2023-12-07 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: Then Mike / Tim means whoever is tagged should review and remove tag if happy
[2023-12-07 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: Or change it to needs work if it needs additional work
[2023-12-07 04:28 PM] rsulfuratus: Name check is useful
[2023-12-07 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: what's that for, exactly?
[2023-12-07 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: a name that is being proposed?
[2023-12-07 04:28 PM] rsulfuratus: A name that isn’t canonical yet
[2023-12-07 04:29 PM] rsulfuratus: Don’t think ~Place~ need name check tags
[2023-12-07 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: who removes the name check tag though?
[2023-12-07 04:30 PM] rsulfuratus: If it is “I like this name is it okay with you” that is status-Tim or sratus/mike
[2023-12-07 04:31 PM] rsulfuratus: But I need some way to indicate “I just typed something and I want to let it sit for a bit”
[2023-12-07 04:31 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-12-07 04:31 PM] Deciusmus: that makes a lot of sense
[2023-12-07 04:31 PM] Deciusmus: but how about you do status/namecheck, status/tim then?
[2023-12-07 04:31 PM] Deciusmus: or status/namecheck, status/mike, status/tim
[2023-12-07 04:32 PM] Deciusmus: if it is also a name you want to run by me
[2023-12-07 04:32 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah that works
[2023-12-07 04:32 PM] Deciusmus: the implication is that if I see something status/mike status/namecheck without the status/tim I can remove the namecheck if I like the name
[2023-12-07 04:32 PM] Deciusmus: converse for you
[2023-12-07 04:50 PM] Deciusmus: is there any reason to keep ~xxx ~ naming on things with status/namecheck
[2023-12-07 04:51 PM] Deciusmus: specifically the Sayuna Islands
[2023-12-07 04:51 PM] Deciusmus: to me ~XXX~ means XXX is a purely descriptive term for a place on the map with no ideas
[2023-12-07 04:52 PM] Deciusmus: if someone has a bunch of name ideas, add them to the note or discuss. One proposed/prefered, rename note and add status/namecheck
[2023-12-07 04:52 PM] Deciusmus: but no need to have ~xxx~
[2023-12-07 04:52 PM] rsulfuratus: agreed
[2023-12-07 04:54 PM] rsulfuratus: well, I often use ~Conclave War~ or something like that when writing a different note, to give something a temporary name. in that case when the note gets created ideally whoever creates the note should delete the ~~ and add status/namecheck
[2023-12-07 04:54 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, that makes sense
[2023-12-07 04:54 PM] Deciusmus: Any objection to bulk-removing status tags from everything under Worldbuliding/High School Notes and Brainstorming?
[2023-12-07 04:56 PM] rsulfuratus: no
[2023-12-07 04:56 PM] rsulfuratus: although I think we should probably separate "background" from "brainstorming" because status tags are useful on the background stuff
[2023-12-07 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2023-12-07 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: Specifically I am talking about the High School Notes and Brainstorming folders only
[2023-12-07 04:57 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2023-12-07 04:59 PM] rsulfuratus: at some point I might also reorganize worldbuilding and pull the stuff that is world info but really more background from the stuff that is brainstorming/note dumps
[2023-12-07 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-12-07 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, that is what Background vs Brainstorming is supposed to be
[2023-12-07 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: right I was just thinking that should probably be a top level distinction
[2023-12-07 05:00 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2023-12-07 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: if I move a file does it break your secrets stuff?
[2023-12-07 05:01 PM] rsulfuratus: shouldn't as long as you don't rename it
[2023-12-07 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: I want to move the "Unusual Races" doc to Brainstorming from the root of Worldbuilding but it hs a secret
[2023-12-07 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: test it
[2023-12-07 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: works fine
[2023-12-07 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: it is really easy to get sucked into making up details and perfecting the pages of random npcs
[2023-12-07 05:48 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. my current obession is drainage basins
[2023-12-07 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: heh
[2023-12-07 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: I'm going to make dinner but I just spent ~5 minutes making up the backstory of an NPC my PCs already killed 🙂
[2023-12-07 05:50 PM] Deciusmus: I flagged a handful of pages status/tim where I cleaned them up and assume they are complete but am not sure
[2023-12-07 09:26 PM] rsulfuratus: messing around some more with my central lowlands project, i'm not actually sure it makes sense for places to have whereabouts. 
    
    for example, I now have the Dunmari Basin, which lowland plains  bounded by the Sentinels/Myraeni Gap in the north/northwest, the Copper Hills/Yuvanti in the south/southwest, and the Garamjala Plateau in the east
[2023-12-07 09:27 PM] rsulfuratus: there is also the desolation of cha'mutte, which is the large region covering the plaguelands, the nashtkar, the garamjala, and the area south of the plateau
[2023-12-07 09:27 PM] rsulfuratus: the nashtkar, the blasted plain, is the eastern part of the Dunmari Basin
[2023-12-07 09:28 PM] rsulfuratus: so Kharsan is a location that is in:
    a) the Dunmari Basin
    b) the Nashtkar
[2023-12-07 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: th Nashtkar being defined roughly as the part of the Dunmari Basin that overlaps the Desolation of Cha'mutte
[2023-12-07 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: so, you could get away with it for Kharsan, it is in Nashtkar
[2023-12-07 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: but what is the Nashtkar in? it is both Desolation of Cha'mutte and Dunmari Basin
[2023-12-07 09:30 PM] rsulfuratus: i actually think places just need affiliations and you follow the "primary" chain
[2023-12-07 09:31 PM] rsulfuratus: but for clarity we might just use partOf for this and just reuse some of the affiliation code for generating the chains
[2023-12-07 09:32 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway nothing I want to revise immediately
[2023-12-07 09:32 PM] rsulfuratus: just some idle thoughts
[2023-12-07 09:37 PM] Deciusmus: what's the goal of having a place be part of two things?
[2023-12-07 09:37 PM] Deciusmus: is it to generate a listing of places in the desolition of cha'mutte? just to record accurate metadata?
[2023-12-07 09:38 PM] rsulfuratus: well at the moment it is just to have accurate metadata
[2023-12-07 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: i think there are a couple of possible use cases, though
[2023-12-07 09:41 PM] rsulfuratus: one is just getting lists of places in regions. the value of this decays as the region gets bigger and bigger
[2023-12-07 09:43 PM] rsulfuratus: but there is no reason in principle this has to happen at a high level of abstraction
[2023-12-07 09:44 PM] rsulfuratus: the more detail that exists the more you get overlapping features at all levels of any kind of abstract hierachy
[2023-12-07 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: you can even see it in a place like tollen. if I had a page for Guy Marchand's shop, should it be on Scrollwright Street or in the ward its in (I think Godhome)
[2023-12-07 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: since Scrollwright Street spans wards, you have to pick one
[2023-12-07 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: again, just kind of idle thought - it might not be worthwhile to change, and maybe the best policy is to just use wherabouts for the thing you want the chain to follow
[2023-12-07 09:49 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-12-07 09:50 PM] Deciusmus: I feel like there is something missing from the metadata but I'm not quite sure what it is...
[2023-12-07 09:58 PM] rsulfuratus: on a separate topic, I like Twilight's Grace for Ethlenn
[2023-12-07 09:58 PM] rsulfuratus: not quite sure about the moon in the feywild yet. how important is that to know soon?
[2023-12-07 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: I have a PC researching legends of the fey, and he rolled incredibly well. They are on a dungeon crawl right now that will take them one more session to finish, but I probably need to come up with something for him to have figured out by my Jan session
[2023-12-07 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: He is the dwarven lunar sorcerer, so he is specifically interested in what, if anything, the moon and the feywild have to do with each other
[2023-12-07 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus: ah
[2023-12-07 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: don't need to give him real answers per se, because there is only so much he can find in Cleenseau
[2023-12-07 10:01 PM] Deciusmus: but it would be good to have some context to make up half-truths
[2023-12-07 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus: so, I wrote this kind of on a whim when I wanted to do something different for one of my intros (around the Empty Moon / werewolf arc) and I haven't quite figured out what it means yet
[2023-12-07 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-15194.png]]
[2023-12-07 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus: what is key is the idea of extraplanar tides
[2023-12-07 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus: this is also now canonically part of elven lore, albeit on a different time scale
[2023-12-07 10:05 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, my sorceror gets a different bonus spell in the new vs full moon
[2023-12-07 10:05 PM] rsulfuratus: what i am not sure is if the moon is responsible for extraplanar tides on taelgar, does it really make sense for it to actually exist on other planes?
[2023-12-07 10:05 PM] Deciusmus: on the theory that during the full moon its divine/outer planes, during new moon it is fey/inner planes
[2023-12-07 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus: right that makes sense and is consistent with lore
[2023-12-07 10:06 PM] Deciusmus: right, you are wondering about this line: " rising bright rising moon. "
[2023-12-07 10:06 PM] Deciusmus: I forgot i wrote that
[2023-12-07 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-12-07 10:07 PM] Deciusmus: stars probably work better actually
[2023-12-07 10:07 PM] Deciusmus: I didn't want Twilight's Grace to feel gloomy
[2023-12-07 10:07 PM] Deciusmus: so that moon line was just throwaway
[2023-12-07 10:08 PM] Deciusmus: happy to change that
[2023-12-07 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus: it is kind of an important decision that seems like it is hard to go back on so want a bit of time to puzzle it out
[2023-12-07 10:09 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, sure
[2023-12-07 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus: agree twilight's grace shouldn't feel gloomy
[2023-12-07 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus: but also light could work differently in the feywild. no need for a visible source of moonlight to have moonlight
[2023-12-07 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2023-12-07 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: I could also imagine a faint glow on the horizon and a spray of stars, like the milky way above
[2023-12-07 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway i deleted namecheck but will leave status/tim to remind me to think about it a bit.
[2023-12-07 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus: I kind of like the faint glow on the horizon and a spray of stars imagery
[2023-12-07 10:13 PM] Deciusmus: I rewrote it like:
    
    
    The realm of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. A land of perpetual twilight, but full of sparkling lights, music, and games.
    
    `%%` 
    
    Note: Could potentially have a moonlight connection, but unclear if there is a moon in the Feywild. For now avoid reference/mention of moon until this is determined.
    
    `%%`
[2023-12-07 10:18 PM] rsulfuratus: btw, Akan is a perfect example of how a "with" would be useful. I wrote out the chronology because I wanted a record somewhere of the general ebb and flow of Karawa area refugees during the early part of the campaign
[2023-12-07 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus: but really this should go on an events page (part of the gnoll attacks), and then all the people who are moving together can just be with xxx
[2023-12-07 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus: where xxx is probably someone like the priestess of the five sibling temple in karawa or another kind of "city leader" type
[2023-12-07 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus: of this:
    ```
    - (DR:: 1748-03-22) `*`(Akan)*: Attacked with his extended family at the [[Gomat]] oasis by enraged giant lizards. One of the few survivors. 
    - (DR:: 1748-03-23) `*`(Akan)*: Met the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] (who [[Session 2 (DuFr)|killed the lizards]]) while returning to camp to gather supplies for the ride to [[Karawa]]. They returned his sister's amulet to him (she was killed in the giant lizard attack), helped his family recover, and made a very favorable impression. 
    - (DR:: 1748-03-27) `*`(Akan)*: Arrived in [[Karawa]] for the [[Festival of Rebirth]].
    - (DR:: 1748-04-07) `*`(Akan)*: Leaves [[Karawa]] with Dunmari evacuation
    - (DR:: 1748-04-13) `*`(Akan)*: Reaches [[Tokra]]
    - (DR:: 1748-06-08) `*`(Akan)*: Leaves [[Tokra]] to return to [[Karawa]]
    - (DR:: 1748-06-15) `*`(Akan)*: Returns to [[Karawa]] from [[Tokra]], for the [[Feast of Bhishma]]
    - (DR:: 1748-06-22) *(Akan):* Returns to nomadic lifestyle traveling north and east of [[Karawa]] with his extended family and his diminished sheep herds. 
    ```
[2023-12-07 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus: only the first two should really be there, the rest should be part of a different page t
[2023-12-07 10:24 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I wasn't sure if writing out the whereabouts even made sense; I just did it to experiment
[2023-12-07 10:25 PM] Deciusmus: you could even have a with "the Karawa Refugees"
[2023-12-07 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2023-12-07 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus: that would be even better
[2023-12-07 10:25 PM] Deciusmus: I kinda lost steam on dates, might need an easier coding project
[2023-12-07 10:25 PM] Deciusmus: with might be it
[2023-12-07 10:26 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is quite simple, you just copy the whereabouts from the with page
[2023-12-07 10:26 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-12-07 10:26 PM] rsulfuratus: probably need a filter option as to whether you just copy (default) or whether you report "with XXX, whereabouts"
[2023-12-07 10:27 PM] rsulfuratus: because e.g. for halfling ships you probably want to code it as with, but displaying "on The Emerald Song, location"
[2023-12-07 10:27 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. the idea is that 
    
    { type: with, start: x, end: y, person: z }
    
    means
    
    go to page Z, get all of the whereabouts that were 'active' between x and y, and include them, but use type: away for all
[2023-12-07 10:27 PM] Deciusmus: I think we have a p/P for person
[2023-12-07 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: and oO iI
[2023-12-07 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus: right we already have that
[2023-12-07 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that would cover all the use cases
[2023-12-07 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: I think the filters could use some rethinking though
[2023-12-07 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: specifically, the other thing I don't like is using whereabouts for item owners
[2023-12-07 10:29 PM] rsulfuratus: agreed
[2023-12-07 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: although maybe that is a use case for "with"
[2023-12-07 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: but it feels like overkill for most items, where you probably don't care aobut the location
[2023-12-07 10:29 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-12-07 10:30 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. I want to be able to specify the owner of an item without caring about where it is
[2023-12-07 10:30 PM] Deciusmus: conceptually I think we need a "relationships" (which is really just affiliations, but a little broader)
[2023-12-07 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus: i actually wonder if an approach might just be to generalize the campaign info framework
[2023-12-07 10:32 PM] rsulfuratus: or maybe not that specifically
[2023-12-07 10:32 PM] rsulfuratus: more precisely basically allow any metadata to be either a string or an object with { name: start: end: }
[2023-12-07 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: then you could just have owner
[2023-12-07 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: (maker is probably best as part of events)
[2023-12-07 10:35 PM] Deciusmus: Which is to say, I think, in general, we could model almost everything with:
    
    * whereabouts (specifically refers to locations, has the concepts of home/away/with, not really one or many)
    * relationships (which have start/end dates and types, refer to other pages that there is some kind of defined relationship with, many to many)
    * interactions (or maybe events) (things which happened at a specific time and place, one to one)
    * part of (a "bigger" thing of the same type this page is part of) (one to many)
[2023-12-07 10:35 PM] Deciusmus: Then "primary" org goes away, and becomes part of
[2023-12-07 10:35 PM] Deciusmus: campaign info goes away, and becomes interactions
[2023-12-07 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: You could imagine a handful of shorthands that define "quick" relationships:
    
    maker: X =>` same as relationships: `[ { type: maker, org: X }]`
    owner: X =>` same as relationships: `[{ type: owner, org: X }]`
    leader: X =>` same as relationships: `[{ type: leader, org: X ]`}
[2023-12-07 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: (probably we'd want to rename org, or allow org/person/place interchangeably or something)
[2023-12-07 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that seems like it would be pretty good
[2023-12-07 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus: although I think partof should be many to many as well, but always same time
[2023-12-07 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus: partOf is just a specific kind of relationship that is useful to define separately
[2023-12-07 10:41 PM] Deciusmus: But it makes modelling something like an item pretty easy.
    
    A really simple item is just owner: X
    
    But if you wanted a complex artifact you could do:
    
    whereabouts: (some long list, intermixed between "with" lines and "home" lines)
    relationships: (maker, owner, etc)
    interactions: (battle of X, destruction of Y)
[2023-12-07 10:41 PM] Deciusmus: See, I think you need some way of indicating "primary"
[2023-12-07 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: partOf is chain-following
[2023-12-07 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: which means it can't be many to many
[2023-12-07 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus: you just have a type: primary that you follow
[2023-12-07 10:43 PM] Deciusmus: In the model above, you have two chains you can follow:
    
    * the whereabouts chain, which defines the current location
    * the part of chain, which defines the "structure"
[2023-12-07 10:43 PM] Deciusmus: but what's the difference between partof and relationship then
[2023-12-07 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus: nothing
[2023-12-07 10:45 PM] Deciusmus: I'd rather write:
    
    Nasktar
    partOf: Dunmari Basin
    relationships: `[ { type: region, location: Desoliation of Cha'mutte, start: 1545 }]`
[2023-12-07 10:45 PM] Deciusmus: than
    Nasktar
    relationships: `[ { type: region, location: Desoliation of Cha'mutte, start: 1545 }, { type: primary, location: Dunmari Basin } ]`
[2023-12-07 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus: ah sure fair enough, that's a good idea
[2023-12-07 10:46 PM] Deciusmus: it also enforces the idea there can only be one primary
[2023-12-07 10:46 PM] Deciusmus: it could support dates but it wouldn't support overlap
[2023-12-07 10:46 PM] Deciusmus: and usually you wouldn't bother with dates
[2023-12-07 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus: right, basically it is like a home whereabout style construction but for primary relationship
[2023-12-07 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: maybe for an important ruler who married into a different house, you might do
    
    partOf: `[ { name: House of Sewick, end: 1545 }, { name: House of Lils, start: 1546 } ]`
[2023-12-07 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-12-07 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: then, you can say that, in general, places never have whereabouts
[2023-12-07 10:48 PM] Deciusmus: Unless a place conceptually actually moves
[2023-12-07 10:48 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. a floating island
[2023-12-07 10:48 PM] Deciusmus: or, I guess
[2023-12-07 10:48 PM] Deciusmus: although
[2023-12-07 10:48 PM] Deciusmus: I guess there could be some advantage on political/nonpolitical
[2023-12-07 10:49 PM] Deciusmus: anyway, idle thoughts. Time for me to go to bed
[2023-12-07 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah me too
[2023-12-07 10:49 PM] Deciusmus: If I do anything soon on this it will be to implement with
[2023-12-07 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus: yes that is a useful incremental step that will help clear up whereabouts for a lot of NPCs
