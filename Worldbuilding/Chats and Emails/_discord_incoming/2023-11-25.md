[2023-11-25 09:15 AM] rsulfuratus: garret tealeaf would be a good example, if you built a tealeaf whereabouts and a charmhearts whereabouts he could be tealeaf ->` lair ->` dufr ->` charmhearts. but i didn't abstract out anyones whereabouts yet
[2023-11-25 09:16 AM] rsulfuratus: was going to use it for the various chardonian adventures when i get a chance.
[2023-11-25 09:56 AM] Deciusmus: I'll play with that. You haven't published session 81 notes yet have you?
[2023-11-25 09:56 AM] rsulfuratus: no, but they are pushed
[2023-11-25 09:56 AM] rsulfuratus: ah session 81 yes, not session 82
[2023-11-25 09:56 AM] Deciusmus: I kinda want to merge my changes relatively soon to reduce conflicts but it might cause some publish challenges for a bit until we sort out the bugs
[2023-11-25 09:59 AM] rsulfuratus: i'm going to rebuild website in next 30 minutes
[2023-11-25 10:00 AM] rsulfuratus: pushed all changes i will make before website build, so feel free to merge
[2023-11-25 10:08 AM] Deciusmus: Have you had a chance to look at the changes? The big one is that `<loc>` is no longer valid and you can use `<current>` `<home>` `<origin>` or `<lastknown>`
[2023-11-25 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus: no, i've been working on content
[2023-11-25 10:08 AM] Deciusmus: Also partOf on places is treated same as whereabouts
[2023-11-25 10:09 AM] Deciusmus: whereas "part of" is still meaningful for organizations
[2023-11-25 10:09 AM] Deciusmus: so i.e. the Dunfry Regiment can be partOf Army of the West and whereabouts: Dunfry
[2023-11-25 10:10 AM] Deciusmus: whereabouts Dunfry (if the page says "partOf Barony of Dunfry) is treated as if it said whereabouts: Barony of Dunfry
