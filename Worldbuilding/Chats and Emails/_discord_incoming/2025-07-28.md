# Discord DM – 2025-07-28

[2025-07-28 01:57 PM] Deciusmus: I emailed the two flightseeing companies in Haines about air taxi stuff
[2025-07-28 01:58 PM] Deciusmus: I think we'd have to split up - the planes don't fit 10 people and neither of the two companies appears to operate multiple planes - but we could book one 6 person and one 4 person plane from each of the two companies, or, if not everyone wanted to do the flightseeing part, split up with some people doing flightseeing and others going straight via air taxi.

[2025-07-28 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: just putting some stuff in a word doc
[2025-07-28 05:00 PM] Deciusmus: I think probably Haines vs Sitka boils down to:
    
    Haines: better for land animals & eagles; best option if people explicitly want flightseeing; slightly simpler arrival logistics; more time on water (Lynn Canal cruise); potentially somewhat more scenic
    Sitka: better for marine animals and seabirds; best option if anyone cares about Tglit culture; easier internal logistics, also best option if anyone is hoping to explicitly avoid small planes
[2025-07-28 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: i dumped recent discord stuff (from jan - now) into obsidian but didn't sort it or grab useful media, fyi
[2025-07-28 08:47 PM] rsulfuratus: btw did you session yesterday resolve when your feywild arc is? i do have a bunch of notes that i haven't organized yet there
[2025-07-28 08:48 PM] rsulfuratus: or am i misremembering the timeline of when that happens?
[2025-07-28 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: October timeframe. Next session is some cleanup of Lich lieutenants and then we are down a player so we are going to do one session during the time skip - so fey wild arc likely starts Oct unless the “one session” of time skip grows
