# Discord DM – 2025-01-20

[2025-01-20 09:32 AM] rsulfuratus: i like your far realm updates
[2025-01-20 10:28 AM] Deciusmus: what's the status of maps right now? I was trying to make slightly better regional divisions than what we have right now, basically so that I could more clearly define what areas of the world don't have any defined history, or have only very specific single historical events
[2025-01-20 10:29 AM] Deciusmus: There is a world-map-regions and a world-map-climate both of which are a little bit different in the base layer and neither of which has the same base layer as the player map
[2025-01-20 10:30 AM] Deciusmus: Is this all one photoshop file that you are pulling different layers out of?
[2025-01-20 01:29 PM] rsulfuratus: Maps are a bit of a mess. There is just one giant photoshop map with many layers that is getting a bit unwieldy. Plus I have some regional hex maps that occasionally have detail missing from the main map
[2025-01-20 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: Some day I’d like to make a canonical hexmap that would be easier to edit for things like regions, climate, working out changing borders/history, etc
[2025-01-20 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: Then just use the fancy photoshop map as the main player map
[2025-01-20 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: But it takes a bit of work to get there
[2025-01-20 01:39 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I’ve added some detail to various sembara maps directly in the pngs in obsidian
[2025-01-20 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: Are you guys still in NH? We still need to get maple syrup and the camera for Z from you
[2025-01-20 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: (I guess you are probably driving or hiking or something, anyway.... back to Taelgar...)
    
    As I try to collate a lot of the history post-Downfall, there are some gaps that keep coming up as "undefined / undetermined" which make telling a cohesive narrative somewhat difficult.
    
    Some of the gaps are irrelevant or intentional, but not all of them.
[2025-01-20 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: In particular, I think you can divide up the Drankorian world into basically six areas:
    (a) the core coastal plains including Drankor itself
    (b) the Istaros river valley
    (c) the Nevos Sea/Illoria/Apporia
    (d) the near Green Sea shores: South Cymea/eastern mountains/southern Cymea - the whole sorta ill-defined section along the south western Green Sea
    (e) Greater Sembara
    (f) the west coast
[2025-01-20 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: Of those (a), (b), and (e) are pretty well defined, at least in terms of the influence of Drankor on post-Drankorian history
[2025-01-20 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: (c) and (f) have numerous open questions, but the very big picture is pretty well defined (although there are some questions as to when Illoria is conqueored by Drankor or really if it canonicaly should have been?)
[2025-01-20 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: (d) is a gaping blank area in the history
[2025-01-20 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: We are back now
[2025-01-20 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: I was driving then doing errands
[2025-01-20 02:51 PM] rsulfuratus: if you want to get stuff you can swing by whenever
[2025-01-20 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: we just got home from eating lunch in davis but I might swing by later
[2025-01-20 02:51 PM] rsulfuratus: re: Taelgar history, i think the problem with (d) is that, in general, the modern day details don't really exist either
[2025-01-20 02:51 PM] rsulfuratus: so it is hard to make up a history
[2025-01-20 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: we have some brainstorming notes, i believe, that attempt to explain why drankor expanded north and west, but not really east very far, since the geography is a bit atypical for an empire in some sense
[2025-01-20 02:53 PM] Deciusmus: yeah there is a lot of brainstorming notes that I haven't fully looked through
[2025-01-20 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: i think from a worldbuilding perspective, the stuff east of the mountains east of drankor is canonically 'not Drankorian' but beyond that it is a bit of a blank slate, intentionally so
[2025-01-20 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: Right the area I'm talking about is this yellow circle:
![[../_discord_assets/image-EE629.png]]
[2025-01-20 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: but i guess this leaves (d) as kind of a big hole that could use filling, since that is west of those mountains
[2025-01-20 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-01-20 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: Everything to the east of that circle is "intentionally poorly defined"
[2025-01-20 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: a good chunk of southern part of that circle was rostaure
[2025-01-20 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: basically the entire north shore of that weird bay
[2025-01-20 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: to the west and north (with a few exceptions around Cymea) is fairly well defined
[2025-01-20 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: no idea what is there now, though. presumably wilderness
[2025-01-20 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: is rostaure meant to be another surival of the big pre-downfall elves? or a new foundation
[2025-01-20 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: ?
[2025-01-20 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: we had a lot of talk earlier about a huge Pantal/Everglades inland swamp, but I think that was to the east of the circle
[2025-01-20 03:01 PM] Deciusmus: I think the theory is that most of that coastline along the green sea (between the mountain ranges) would have been empty land post-Downfall
[2025-01-20 03:01 PM] rsulfuratus: never decided
[2025-01-20 03:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the big lizardfolk swamps became the southern green sea after the downfall
[2025-01-20 03:02 PM] rsulfuratus: but were east of the mountains, anyway
[2025-01-20 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: In a bunch of the green sea brainstorming we had discussed the fact that there is no large swampland on Taelgar, and I think were considering something south of the "mariener trade peninusla" as having survived
[2025-01-20 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: but that's in the "intentionally blank space" out east
[2025-01-20 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: right, yeah
[2025-01-20 03:04 PM] Deciusmus: In fact, it is really only the red circle here that is poorly defined:
![[../_discord_assets/image-66C86.png]]
[2025-01-20 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: the squiggly yellow presumably never recovers from the plague. Although it isn't clear to me where the proto-Dunmari were or came from or went to
[2025-01-20 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: the blue circle becomes Isingue
[2025-01-20 03:07 PM] rsulfuratus: early on, i had the dunmari migration from undetermined homeland split, with some going ??? (variously, what we later called MTP or the red circle), and the rest continuing west to Dunmar
[2025-01-20 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: although the split is canonical, i've increasingly felt it doesn't really make sense for the other part of the dunmari to have settled so close to Dunmar (e.g, red circle), separated only from  Dunmar by Isingue (which is hardly a barrier)
[2025-01-20 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: it
[2025-01-20 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: it's never really fit with the vibe of Dunmar for there to have been a second branch of the Dunmari so close - it really only works if they are far/distant/lost somehow
[2025-01-20 03:09 PM] Deciusmus: So would it make sense for the dunmari homeland to be "out east" and after the split some of them went back towards the homeland?
[2025-01-20 03:09 PM] rsulfuratus: that seems more logical
[2025-01-20 03:09 PM] Deciusmus: canonically the split was in the headwaters of that river that divides the yellow and red areas, right?
[2025-01-20 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: it is not clearly determined, actually
[2025-01-20 03:10 PM] Deciusmus: But actually having the Dunmari homeland way out east simplifies alot of the Drankorian cultural history, as the Dunmari can just "appear" from nowhere basically, they were either on the fringes of Drankor or just far enough away that Drankor was only a legend
[2025-01-20 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: story/whatever
[2025-01-20 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: the other question that came up on the dunmari migration is... were there any drankorians still in the coastal plain they were riding into? or is this meant to all be plague-scarred and depopulated?
[2025-01-20 03:12 PM] rsulfuratus: the traditional three great rivers of Dunmar are the Hara, Kharja, and Mahar (Istaros), and the country is more or less founded on the banks of the Kharja. 
    
    but the split could happen either at the Istaros (Mahar) or an eastern tributary
[2025-01-20 03:13 PM] rsulfuratus: re: drankorians - it is not necesarily clear how true the religious history of the dunmari has to be.
[2025-01-20 03:15 PM] rsulfuratus: but the vibe of the founding myth is supposed to be:
    - dunmari ride, driven by their gods, into what is basically a dying land. exactly how/why the land is dying is not stated, but presumably an aftereffect of the plague
    - jeevali performs great miracle to heal the land, makes everything better, dies, is reborn
    - the dunmari kill / drive out everyone who was living there, saying the gods saved the land for them
[2025-01-20 03:16 PM] rsulfuratus: so the implication is that some people may have survived. or, possibly, it was undead, or plague demons, or ???
[2025-01-20 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: Right. So a canonical way of putting it might be:
    
    * Shortly after the fall of Drankor, a new people, the Dunmari, sweep west, from an undetermined homeland somewhere east of the Drankorian sphere of influence.
    * These Dunmari, speaking a unique language and worshipping their own gods, rapidly establish a new homeland  - that they claim their gods have given to them - across the coastal plains
    * Whatever they are displacing - surviving humans? undead? plague demons? - is not clear, but by (XXX date) the sweap of land from (X) to (Y) is clearly Dunmari
[2025-01-20 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah the vibe is supposed to be somewhat like spread of islam right after the death of muhammad - very quick
[2025-01-20 03:22 PM] rsulfuratus: the founding is DR 1171 - DR 1173, roughly, and the dunmar probably expand to the modern "Dunmari Basin" plus some of the area stretching east to the Mahar (modern day Xurkhaz) within 10 years
[2025-01-20 03:23 PM] rsulfuratus: the exact borders are a little vague because it is not clear exactly what is happening with Isingue at this time, and how far south it expands, etc
[2025-01-20 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: in the historical framework doc I'm working on I have the fall of Drankor being ~15 years, and had dunmars founding as part of that (short) era
[2025-01-20 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: right, I think the exact borders here don't matter, as it is distrubted again with the Great War
[2025-01-20 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: but isingue and dunmar are presumably neighbors
[2025-01-20 03:24 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah in the high school maps we had that (with old names)
[2025-01-20 03:24 PM] rsulfuratus: the vibe in the pre-great-war dunmari history is that they thrive on trade passing from isingue to chardon
[2025-01-20 03:25 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the fall of drankor era is probably longer than 15 years. 
    
    i mean, the immediate fall of drankor is very, very fast, basically just a single day when cha'mutte traps apollyon and unleashes the plague
[2025-01-20 03:26 PM] Deciusmus: I guess it is probably more like a hundred years of unclear disruptions and resettlements
[2025-01-20 03:29 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the two things in my head here are:
    (1) the plague doesn't immediately curse the land. the city of drankor is haunted by the plague dead, and hard to survive in, but you have a kind of creeping corruption spread out from drankor, and over the next few years crops fail, cities die and are abandoned, etc 
    (2) Apollyon was already in the process of centralizing a lot of things, collecting knowledge to himself, trying to suppress Mos Numena, etc. but his power base is very central, driven by the fact that all the important people in drankor are magically under his control. so there is already some tension between the center and the periphery.
[2025-01-20 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: so i think this could lead to a bunch of chaos for a while. you have refugees fleeing north and west and east; maybe Sembaran/Cymea declare themselves a new Drankorian Empire for a time but it breaks down / falls apart for various reasons (not the least of which might be the loss of important magical knowledge - e.g., Drankor helped keep things together with teleportation circles, but these are clearly lost magic now)
[2025-01-20 03:32 PM] rsulfuratus: we have some scattered dates - the First Duke of Sembara in 1142; the founding of Dunmar in 1171, - the suggest a kind of resurgence really not until the mid 1100s at the earliest
[2025-01-20 03:33 PM] rsulfuratus: there is also a possibility for supernatural / magical events to come into play here
[2025-01-20 03:33 PM] Deciusmus: right.
[2025-01-20 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: partly, I just did the math wrong and thought it was canonically immediately after the plague
[2025-01-20 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: its 5304 not 5204
[2025-01-20 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: (drankor falls in 5192)
[2025-01-20 03:36 PM] Deciusmus: but it makes sense to say basically 5192 - 5300 is "the fall of Drankor" and a time of chaos, etc where we don't really try to define events per se. I don't see a ton of value in making up a lot of events in the chaos speculatively, although it is a good time period to place some kind of odd catastrophy or magical problem or whatever
[2025-01-20 03:37 PM] Deciusmus: is the idea that the northerns landed first in Iloria important to keep as canon?
[2025-01-20 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: no
[2025-01-20 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: I think there is more flexibility to develop Illoria if we leave it unclear where exactly the first northeners landed
[2025-01-20 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. maybe Illoria is really Southerner
[2025-01-20 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: or at least, part southerner
[2025-01-20 04:56 PM] rsulfuratus: added this chat to obsidian just based on copy/paste - if you have a fancier way to do it feel free to replace
[2025-01-20 04:56 PM] Deciusmus: nope, I was going to do the same
[2025-01-20 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: in the interest of "finishing" something I've switched from the grand sweep of history to trying to clean up a bunch of the notes on human cultures into a cohesive background outline.
[2025-01-20 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: I'm trying something a little bit different, which is to document
    (a) the rules - i.e. the established background of the migrations from Hkar
    (b) the existing cultures
    (c) the explicit blank spaces
[2025-01-20 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm trying to finish the top-level cosmology tonight, just have some plane of souls and land of the dead clean up to do, but also this raises some open questions. 
    
    is your idea that open questions pages should be relatively "big", that is, a series of cosmology-related open questions on one page, or should it be more narrow, e.g. a separate page for specific questions about the actual metaphysics of souls, vs the metaphysics of the land of the dead, etc
[2025-01-20 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure
[2025-01-20 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: I've only really thought about it in the context of the history page, which is really one big page
[2025-01-20 05:04 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm going to start with a big page but if you see an obvious / sensible way to break it up, i don't have strong feelings
[2025-01-20 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: It is easy to link to h1/h2 headings though, so I might be inclined to just have a one or two open questions pages and link to headings as needed
[2025-01-20 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: random idea: what do you think of Mawar not being founded by northerners at all (at least, not primarily) but by a second set of refugees from the downfall who didn't end up in Drankor?
[2025-01-20 05:11 PM] rsulfuratus: Mawar has always been a bad fit for a northerner origin, IMO, but i haven't developed its history in detail in large part because so much of the history of the west is a bit of a blank slate
[2025-01-20 05:11 PM] rsulfuratus: i like mawar a lot as a place and i'm kind of tempted to leave it blank for now, since it is a reasonable place i might want to set a campaign in in the future
[2025-01-20 05:12 PM] rsulfuratus: there is actually a semi-developed ancient history there about elemental cults from one of the mawar adventures that i never typed up
[2025-01-20 05:12 PM] Deciusmus: what I wrote in the canonical human cultures update I am working on is:
    
    ### Mawar
    The [[Mawakel Peninsula]] is home to a unique people worshipping their own version of [[Mos Numena]] and with their own unique language. The cultural derivation of these people is not clear, although many other documents assume Northern/Drankorian blend. Other possibilities could work, including a second set of Downfall Refugees or a intermixing of a unique pantheonic culture with Drankorian culture,
[2025-01-20 05:14 PM] Deciusmus: is the emerald bay coast of Apporia best though of as part of the Nevos Sea/Illorian cultural context? or is own thing?
[2025-01-20 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-7B6F2.png]]
[2025-01-20 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: i never made any decisions about anything not on this map
[2025-01-20 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a bit of a complex history here, not sure how much is actually in obsidian vs secrets
[2025-01-20 05:18 PM] Deciusmus: there is a bunch of stuff about th Umbral Covenant, and the pirates of Illoria, and the War of the Dark Rift
[2025-01-20 05:19 PM] Deciusmus: that is a nice  map you should add it to the approia page
[2025-01-20 05:21 PM] rsulfuratus: I am pretty sure I intentionally phrased this as in-world lore in case I changed my mind about the original settlement of Apporia: "According to the records of the Chardonian Empire, the Apporian Peninsula was originally settled by the Drankorians, who originally constructed the [[Old Chardon Canal]] and established a series of maritime bases on the [[Gulf of Chardon]] and the [[Nevos Sea]], although never reached the western coast or the interior. "
[2025-01-20 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: I think from a human cultures point of view, you have a general Apporia / Illoria / Nevos Sea "vibe" that is very maritime, with influences from Venice, Genoa, and the Age of Sail. but lots of the exact history is blank, some parts intentioanlly
[2025-01-20 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`intentionally
[2025-01-20 05:25 PM] Deciusmus: Really though what I'm trying to do is round out the list of "known" cultures in the west coast as between:
    * intentionally blank
    * defined
    * some canonical details but not entirely defined
[2025-01-20 05:25 PM] Deciusmus: for "defined" what I have so far is:
    Mawar
    Chardon
    North-coastal Apporia
[2025-01-20 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: for some canonical details but not entirely defined I have
    "northern realms"
    "nevos sea/illoria"
[2025-01-20 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: for intentionally blank I have:
    Interior and west coast of Apporia
[2025-01-20 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: plus "north bay/north of Voltara"
[2025-01-20 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: I'm mostly just not sure if east coast of Apporia is "intentionally blank" or "nevos sea/illoria"
[2025-01-20 05:29 PM] rsulfuratus: My feeling is that another standard human culture doesn’t fit there. It is either something maigcal/weird that explicitly makes it hard for illorian culture to expand there, or it is illorian.
[2025-01-20 05:29 PM] rsulfuratus: But I’m pretty undecided between those two options
[2025-01-20 05:29 PM] rsulfuratus: And not sure I want to decide now
[2025-01-20 05:29 PM] Deciusmus: right so it isn't its own thing - it is either part of nevos sea or it is part of "potential apporia weirdness"
[2025-01-20 05:29 PM] Deciusmus: no need to decide now
