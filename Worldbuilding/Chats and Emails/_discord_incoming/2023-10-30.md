# Discord DM – 2023-10-30

[2023-10-30 09:29 AM] rsulfuratus: working out some elven generational dynamics. lmk what you think. basic assumptions are from the demographics spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rMp9eP617CMDdkDgmDRPpOOUbO0TjTY17578DK2wPwo/edit#gid=838085721). assume that most elves survive to 800-900, but many choose to leave the world between 950 - 1150, so basic demographic structure then sets up 7 ka as the "current population", with anyone born more than 7 ka ago clearly a rare elder.
[2023-10-30 09:36 AM] rsulfuratus: to put it in 1749 dynamics, you have:
    37th ka (born in 1627 +/-), currently the youngest generation, and currently in their wandering/pre-parent phase
    36th ka (born in 1467 +/-), the Great War generation, but also the current parental generation, probably sharing most responsibility for community management and governance with the 35th ka
    35th ka (born in 1307 +/-), the 'grandparent' generation, probably the main pillar of elven society
    34th ka (born in 1147 +/-), the youngest of the 'elder' generations, probably not yet leaving in great numbers,
    33th ka (born in 987 +/-), the elders
    32nd ka (born in 827 +/-), the oldest of the elder generations
    31st ka (born in 667 +/-), the leaving generation, in the midst of departures, rapidly declining in numbers
    30th ka and older (born before 507 +/-), the remaining generation, those who decided not to leave the world for whatever reason, small in number and hard to find
[2023-10-30 09:37 AM] rsulfuratus: basically you have, at any one time, one generation of "children", two generations of "adults", and three generations of "elders", and then the "post-elders" whatever, but the 7th ka in the past (31st in 1749) would be transitional between elders and "post-elders"
[2023-10-30 09:38 AM] rsulfuratus: at one point i thought you had sketched out some idea about transitions in responsbility among the ka but I can't find any notes at the moment
[2023-10-30 09:40 AM] Deciusmus: I had a sketch in email that was basically 3 roles:
    
    The "nurturer", who watches over the young and the homeland
    The "caretaker", who watches over the elder races (essentially in charge of foreign policy)
    The "unifier", who mediates disputes
[2023-10-30 09:41 AM] Deciusmus: and then an alternating pattern on which generation takes which role
[2023-10-30 09:41 AM] Deciusmus: let me see if I can find what I wrote
[2023-10-30 09:43 AM] rsulfuratus: ah I found it
[2023-10-30 09:43 AM] Deciusmus: It was in email, too big to paste here
[2023-10-30 09:43 AM] rsulfuratus: in your "Dawn of Everything" worldbuilding phase
[2023-10-30 09:43 AM] Deciusmus: ha, yeah
[2023-10-30 09:45 AM] Deciusmus: I'm not wedded to that exact structure for elves, but I do like the idea of rotating leadership based on generations.
[2023-10-30 09:45 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah mostly I am trying to figure out who in Orenlas would remember Drankor
[2023-10-30 09:46 AM] rsulfuratus: i think from a game perspective it is better if these people are not a dime a dozen, seems weird that there would be mystery about history if most elves can remember 1000 years ago clearly
[2023-10-30 09:47 AM] rsulfuratus: I like the basic idea that you have nuturer / caretaker roles that alternate, but it might actually work better to speed up the "die off" of the oldest generations a bit
[2023-10-30 09:47 AM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure most elves remember 1000 years ago clearly
[2023-10-30 09:47 AM] Deciusmus: Also
[2023-10-30 09:48 AM] rsulfuratus: basically I want to set up a distinction between the bulk of elvish society that are in the wanderer / caretaker / nuturer phase and the elders who are beginning to think about leaving to happen around 3-4 generations in the phase
[2023-10-30 09:48 AM] rsulfuratus: `*`past
[2023-10-30 09:48 AM] rsulfuratus: but I think that works with your alternating scheme
[2023-10-30 09:49 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah, I think basically they scheme I had no major role for anyone beyond current-2
[2023-10-30 09:49 AM] Deciusmus: So the 34th ka and earlier, are the "elders" in current time
[2023-10-30 09:51 AM] Deciusmus: Also, consider that outside of the "caretaker" phase many elves might not pay that much attention to human history. And I really don't think elves necessarily remember everything clearly either. 
    
    You can even  imagine a sort of intentional forgetting, as part of aging and the changing of the generations, where the focus of a specific elf changes
[2023-10-30 09:51 AM] rsulfuratus: right
[2023-10-30 09:52 AM] Deciusmus: I definitely agree that very old elves are rare, but I think there is probably a fair number of moderately old elves, i.e. who were alive during the Drankorian empire, but who just made no effort to remember that. They've been in the Feywild for 300 years, or whatever, and the mortal world isn't really a concern
[2023-10-30 09:52 AM] rsulfuratus: many very old elves for example may take on a ritual role (like unifiers in your email) and as part of that begin to shed their sense of their earlier life
[2023-10-30 09:53 AM] Deciusmus: I like both an explicit magical/ritual change and also just normal forgetfulness
[2023-10-30 09:53 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think this gets at what I wanted, there is kind of a transition around 3-4 ka ago from "normal old person" to "elder" that has very distinct and elven flavor
[2023-10-30 09:55 AM] rsulfuratus: some of that is just about forgetting, some about leaving to other planes, some about magic/ritual, etc, but it gives a flavor/transition point that is ~500-600 years ago
[2023-10-30 09:55 AM] rsulfuratus: have a meeting now but am going to sketch this out in a bit more detail later today
[2023-10-30 09:57 AM] Deciusmus: Is there a definitive abbrevation for dwarven vs drankorian years? I have been using DR = Drankorian but I see DE in some of your docs
[2023-10-30 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus: I have not been consistent. I think DR for drankorian reckoning is most common
[2023-10-30 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus: Need something else for dwarven years
[2023-10-30 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: Your dates for the end of the Drankorian conquest of Sembara (treat @ volta) don't line up
    
    Drankor history has 402 (402 DR: The Treaty of Marhavn ('Mar-hahvn'), signed by Emperor Goristo, establishes the Volta as the northern border of the Drankorian Empire; the Skaer and other descendants of the ancient mariner cultures living in what is now Sembara and Cymea are imperial subjects.)
    
    Tollen history has 414 (In 4547, the Drankorians and the Skaer sign a peace treaty, establishing the [[River Volta|Volta]] as the frontier of the [[Drankorian Empire]]. Tollen, on the north side of the [[River Volta|Volta]], remains technically outside the Drankorian territorial claim.)
    
    Did I do the math wrong? 4547-4133 = 414
[2023-10-30 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: which date is right?
[2023-10-30 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus: ah I didn't check the Tollen doc. probably easier to change tollen history doc to 402. they are close enough shouldn't matter
[2023-10-30 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus: but I don't really have a strong preference
[2023-10-30 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: I will change Tollen doc
[2023-10-30 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: I have this in my Sembara "new attempt at a timeline":
    
    DR 358: [[Emperor Anates]] campaigns around the [[Mostreve Hills]]
    DR 360: [[Emperor Anates]] crosses the [[River Enst|Enst]] and establishes a garrison at [[Cleenseau]]
    DR 399: [[Emperor Goristo]] signs the [[Treaty of Tyrwingha]] with [[Archfey Ethlenn|Ethlenn]]
    DR 402: The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] ('Mar-hahvn') is signed by [[Emperor Goristo]] 
    DR 431: The Drankorian [[Highland Conquest Wars]] end with a tactical retreat by Drankor
[2023-10-30 12:43 PM] Deciusmus: here is my current working document.
    https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/blob/main/History/Timeline%20of%20Sembaran%20History.md
[2023-10-30 12:43 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is a nicer way to organize history. Trying to move away from the narrative chronology because I find it hard to actually make up stuff when I have to make up all the details to feed into a narrative
[2023-10-30 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: My intention is to fill out the bullets taking bits from the Sembaran Chronicle doc and then delete the Sembaran history chronicle
[2023-10-30 01:31 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I was moving in that direction with the Drankor stuff
[2023-10-30 01:33 PM] rsulfuratus: generally I am trying to move more of the taelgarverse stuff to bullet points and accesssible notes, rather than long  narrative
[2023-10-30 02:15 PM] rsulfuratus: thinking a bit about biology/fertility/lifespan of other species as part of a bit of cleanup of the species directory.
[2023-10-30 02:17 PM] rsulfuratus: general idea is: elder races (need new name) are all long-lived but generally not super high fertility, each for somewhat unique reasons. humans, goblinoids, are basically typical Earth human. fey have their own strange relationship with time. other species are basically assumed to be human-like unless there is an obvious lore reason to change them.
[2023-10-30 02:17 PM] rsulfuratus: elves: non-overlapping generations, ka, as we've discussed extensively
[2023-10-30 02:18 PM] rsulfuratus: stoneborn: kind of think they should actually be born from stone, and gradually turn back to stone.
[2023-10-30 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: lizardfolk: generally think of lizardfolk as having a very extended old age. mature at same rate as humans, fertility ends at same rate as humans, but they remain active and healthy into their 200s relatively frequently, so just have a really long elder period. makes their culture a very elder-focused. most kids would know not only their grandparents, but their great- and great-great-grandparents, at least
[2023-10-30 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: dwarves: generally think of dwarves as just having really low fertility, kind of a very extended middle age and a relatively short old age. come of age only a little slower than humans (late 20s/early 30s, when they do the heart of the mountain ceremony), but remain capable of bearing children until 150-200, and then often live another 50 years after that
[2023-10-30 02:24 PM] rsulfuratus: halflings are most human-like, basically Tolkein-esque, just often living a bit longer than humans
[2023-10-30 02:25 PM] Deciusmus: I kinda think lizardfolk need something a little more interesting
[2023-10-30 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah they are the least appealing but not sure what
[2023-10-30 02:25 PM] Deciusmus: I agree on dwarves, halflings, stoneborn
[2023-10-30 02:26 PM] rsulfuratus: general idea is elves and stoneborn are the most alien, dwarves and halflings are the most human
[2023-10-30 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: Dwarves probably need something more interesting too, but it is probably private and secret and not *that* different from humans
[2023-10-30 02:28 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the point about dwarves from a worldbuilding perspective is just that they would kind of feel like stretched out humans - you'd have a lot of dwarven familes with 2-3 kids, they would just often be a decade apart
[2023-10-30 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: Right, that makes sense
[2023-10-30 02:28 PM] rsulfuratus: they already have the coming of age ceremony, the thuhr, all that, I don't think they need too much weird biology on top of that
[2023-10-30 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: That's kinda what I meant by not that different.
[2023-10-30 02:28 PM] rsulfuratus: right, makes sense
[2023-10-30 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: I wasn't thinking weird biology so much as somewhat non-human marriage and family-rearing customs
[2023-10-30 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: I feel like in-game dwarves outside of their homeland are almost always unpaired
[2023-10-30 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that makes sense, also can be left to a player who really cares to develop
[2023-10-30 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, that is true. hadn't noticed that, actually.
[2023-10-30 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: I do have a minor NPC in my game who is a nonbinary dwarve married to a woman. But he is explicitly very undwarven
[2023-10-30 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: `*`they
[2023-10-30 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: the dwarves in Tokra being a notable exception
[2023-10-30 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I guess there was a whole family there
[2023-10-30 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: Anyway, it doesn't matter much. I just expect there is something a little more interesting going on in the dwarven marriage and pair-bonding culture than "copied from humans"
[2023-10-30 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, sure
[2023-10-30 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: But it wouldn't be a world-building thing
[2023-10-30 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: Lizardfolk on the other hand.... a few ideas...
    
    hatch from eggs? Maybe culturally there are large rare clutches from just one woman? so lots of siblings, no sense of nuclear families, pairbonding unrelated to child-rearing
    
    a spawn stage after birth, like where they are more fish like and independent?
    
    rapid maturity?
[2023-10-30 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: Not sure I like any of those, just brainstorming
[2023-10-30 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: Could be lots of clutches of eggs, with lots of lizard folk "young" not surviving (but I don't really love that, would imply lots of predators eating the young or something)
[2023-10-30 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: Communal tending of eggs? Temarie like-learning through the shell? Maybe lizardfolk spend a long time in eggs (several years) and the elders tend to the eggs and lizardfolk hatch knowing how to talk and such
[2023-10-30 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe very conscious control over fertility, so the community plans how many kids to have each year (how many eggs to lay?) and it is all very elder directed and egg laying is not really connected to pair bonding or "family" per se
[2023-10-30 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: I think “hatch from eggs” and “primarily aquatic during first few years” are in my notes somewhere
[2023-10-30 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: Could also make them like some fish, maybe they reproduce parthenogenically and have the capability to metamorphose to change sex if desired
[2023-10-30 02:41 PM] rsulfuratus: probably want to run some ideas by Eric before making anything canon
[2023-10-30 02:41 PM] rsulfuratus: His Mawar lizardfolk character at least had some sense of a “family back home”
[2023-10-30 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: Not sure if anyone else has ever played a lizardfolk in a real game
[2023-10-30 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: Also in the Kenzo one shot Eric played a lizardfolk who had found a baby lizardfolk abandoned and decided to care for it (it turned out to be something else but the idea of a non-aquatic baby needing care has to at least make sense)
[2023-10-30 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: Even if the “find one abandoned” is quite unusual
[2023-10-30 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: another idea. what if the thing about lizardfolk is that they are actually reincarnated. so in order to have a kid you need to convince an ancestor's soul to come back. would give them complete control over fertility since if you don't want a kid you just don't ask.
[2023-10-30 02:53 PM] rsulfuratus: from a worldbuilding perspective I think the key idea is that creating a long-lived race that is much less numerous than humans requires some fiddling with fertility and growth rates.
[2023-10-30 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: I like that last one
[2023-10-30 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: Although "family back home" doesn't necessarily mean "traditional nuclear family"
[2023-10-30 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: Probably the key thing here, which doesn't need a full answer now, is that lizardfolk have specific conscious control over fertility. So population growth is very managed and they tend to maintain stable populations around the carrying capacity limit of their choosen environments
[2023-10-30 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: Which actually makes a ton of worldbuilding sense -- there are no lizardfolk striking out to find new land, for the most part. There could be lizardfolk cultures / communities that are actively expanding, and others than are not, but it would all be very self-conscious and community directed (so not even "each lizardfolk couple" chooses whether to have a kid) but more "each communitiy allocates kids in some fashion"
[2023-10-30 05:16 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think that works well
[2023-10-30 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: Is it annoying to push notes in `%%` from emails to documents?
[2023-10-30 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: I was going to dump some stuff from emails into the elf page and a few other places
[2023-10-30 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: no that's fine, I put a lot of stuff in `%%`
[2023-10-30 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: anything in `%%` is stripped before html conversion so I frequently dump a ton of stuff into docs that way as notes
[2023-10-30 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not always sure the best way to capture various brainstorming and stuff
[2023-10-30 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: there is lots buried away in emails and texts and discord and such
[2023-10-30 05:59 PM] rsulfuratus: I was trying to get Bard to extract useful information from my gmail but it never really worked
[2023-10-30 06:02 PM] Deciusmus: It isn't that hard to find the emails, honestly, it is more that we use so many different channels (email, Google Drive, text, discord) I can never remember where I wrote something
[2023-10-30 06:03 PM] rsulfuratus: text is the least useful, probably better to try to keep worldbuilding stuff out of text. I feel like I'm moving away from Google Drive as well, there is just a lot of legacy stuff there
[2023-10-30 06:03 PM] rsulfuratus: although for the green sea stuff it was kind of useful
[2023-10-30 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, agreed
[2023-10-30 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: I actually think Google Drive is better for brainstorming and conversation then email or discord, except for quick stuff
[2023-10-30 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: It is easier to move stuff from drive ->` obsidian than anything else
[2023-10-30 06:11 PM] rsulfuratus: that's true
[2023-10-30 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: Obsidian is hard to have a back-and-forth in
[2023-10-30 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: Although we haven't tried PRs
[2023-10-30 06:13 PM] Deciusmus: Which I don't think is great for brainstorming
[2023-10-30 06:13 PM] Deciusmus: but I'm not sure
[2023-10-30 06:13 PM] rsulfuratus: my general goal is to keep obsidian for "settled" stuff
[2023-10-30 06:13 PM] Deciusmus: that's fair
[2023-10-30 06:13 PM] rsulfuratus: at least in the main directories - worldbuiling folder and my DM notes are separate
[2023-10-30 06:13 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2023-10-30 06:14 PM] Deciusmus: Although I'm not sure about the best approach for "medium" stuff, i.e. the history of Sembara
[2023-10-30 06:16 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe the best system is to use google drive for that too. but i guess my impression is you were doing a lot of the hobgoblin/sembaran history specificaly to create the backstory for a dungeon, so at that point I would consider it canon
[2023-10-30 06:17 PM] Deciusmus: I am
[2023-10-30 06:17 PM] rsulfuratus: can put stuff that is a bit wobbly in `%%`
[2023-10-30 06:17 PM] Deciusmus: but I'm going a bit beyond what I strictly need for the dunegon
[2023-10-30 06:18 PM] Deciusmus: and I have some random stuff I don't know if you care about, like deciding the date that Drankor and Ethleen signed or treaty, or the date a certain garrison was founded by a Drankorian Emperor
[2023-10-30 06:21 PM] rsulfuratus: hmm, right. i sort of feel like that ancillary stuff is basically fine to just leave, it is probably a bit too complicated to worry explicitly about a system for things like that. if we ever end up with conflicts between different parts of the world bible can just fix them quietly (like the date for the drankor treaty establishing volta as northern border)
[2023-10-30 06:22 PM] rsulfuratus: where a PR might be useful is for a major update to world history outside of a clear game need, e.g. if you wanted to develop the history of cymea in more detail or something like that
[2023-10-30 06:22 PM] Deciusmus: I was wondering if some of that stuff is worth PRing
[2023-10-30 06:23 PM] Deciusmus: It isn't like approvals are `*`required*, so it would be pretty easy for me to push a PR for stuff I'm clarifying outside of the "main" sembaran arc
[2023-10-30 06:23 PM] Deciusmus: and if you didn't get a chance to look at the PR, so what? I could always just merge anyway
[2023-10-30 06:23 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-10-30 06:25 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess my general feeling is true brainstorming is best in worldbuilding notes or google docs still but it would be worth thinking about using PRs a bit for substantial updates
[2023-10-30 06:26 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, I agree on true brainstorming
[2023-10-30 06:26 PM] rsulfuratus: one thing I am working on very slowly is trying to make sure at least stub notes exist for everything, with the general format of dumping everything I have from my old onenote docs plus email/gdrive into a bit `%%` note at the end
[2023-10-30 06:27 PM] rsulfuratus: (I am working on a obsidian-based player's guide a little bit, partially in the context of this low level adventure I want to run which will likely be for various guests from the one-shots last year, since I don't think anyone from the main campaign has time to play more than every other week)
[2023-10-30 07:47 PM] rsulfuratus: looking at your PR now
[2023-10-30 08:28 PM] Deciusmus: how much of the Addermarch stuff that you made up for the family game do you want to keep as canon? I keep shying away from Addermarch because I don't have a good sense of it from that game
[2023-10-30 08:29 PM] rsulfuratus: I didn't really ever make up much history or politics. I do like the city of Addermarch and the apple theme and the brandy houses
[2023-10-30 08:29 PM] rsulfuratus: think that could probably fit no matter the history
[2023-10-30 08:31 PM] rsulfuratus: (Isaac wants to play his character from that game again someday, and Nathaniel is now doing a D&D club at school, so I don't want to totally dump everything from that game as Isaac wants to return to Addermarch and do occasional one shots if he can convince anyone else)
[2023-10-30 08:32 PM] Deciusmus: I'm mapping out the Third Hobgoblin War in a bit more detail, and trying to figure out Addermarch's place it in
[2023-10-30 08:34 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is canonical that it is an indepedent Earldom with ties to both Tyrwingha and Sembara (earl being a Tyrwinghan title anyway)
[2023-10-30 08:35 PM] Deciusmus: I have this basic idea that the Shattered Ice Clan came out of the Sentinel Range and thrust down the Enst, eventually forming a kingdom approximately in the red section:
![[../_discord_assets/image-867E5.png]]
[2023-10-30 08:36 PM] Deciusmus: (and perhaps even a bit farther into the section labelled "borderlands')
[2023-10-30 08:37 PM] Deciusmus: (partly, this is in service of the goal of having Cleenseau being a border fort / interior town / border fort / interior town in cycles to drive some undiscovered ruins beneath the current town)
[2023-10-30 08:42 PM] rsulfuratus: I am copying all my OneNote addermarch notes to Obsidian now, will push (in worldbuilding) soon
[2023-10-30 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: but basically I don't have anything developed (at least that I care about) regarding poltiical history of the area. if they were on the border of a hobgoblin kingdom in the 1600s it doesn't matter to me.
[2023-10-30 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: the only stuff I particulary want to keep is the current day vibe
[2023-10-30 08:43 PM] Deciusmus: Actually, thinking about it, I wonder if the hobgoblins pushed all the way to the border with Tyrwingha, cutting off Addermarch effectively
[2023-10-30 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: that would work too
[2023-10-30 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: (Do you care about "TM1 and TM2" btw on the map?
[2023-10-30 08:44 PM] rsulfuratus: no
[2023-10-30 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: We originally had some Tyrwinghan marches, but the development of Tyrwingha so far hasn't really had a place for them
[2023-10-30 08:51 PM] rsulfuratus: added addermarch notes: https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/blob/main/Worldbuilding/Addermarch.md
[2023-10-30 08:52 PM] rsulfuratus: but again a lot of that can change, just want to keep the basic vibe. i think it works actually if addermarch feels kind of isolated in general
[2023-10-30 08:59 PM] Deciusmus: Is there any canon on how/when the wall in western Sembara was built?
[2023-10-30 08:59 PM] Deciusmus: Did it exist in the one-shot against the stone titan?
[2023-10-30 09:00 PM] Deciusmus: The vibe you describe in those notes is pretty Tyrwinghan, in a way, actually. I could imagine Addermarch being somewhat isolated and also somewhat closer to Tyrwingha than Sembara
[2023-10-30 09:01 PM] rsulfuratus: my notes from the stone titan one-shot are pretty ambiguous about whether the western sembara fortifications exist at that time
[2023-10-30 09:02 PM] rsulfuratus: that works imo
[2023-10-30 09:06 PM] Deciusmus: I'm leaning towards "the [[Sentinel Range War]]" in the early 1560s (mostly the highland kingdoms and dwarves) being against something really scary and inspiring a period of fortifications in the 1560s in the west, which seem prophetic when the 1st hobgoblin war is in that area.
    
    The wall is extended in the 1570s after the 1st hobgoblin war, but the 2nd and 3rd hobgoblin wars are fought along the Enst, not the western frontier
[2023-10-30 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: Cece then, during the long peace, invests a fair bit in border defense, which includes strengthing and supporting Maseau and Addermarch and wall-building in the west
[2023-10-30 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: the original reason for the wall on the map was the idea that the devastion around Urlich is still a cursed place and occasionally spawns weird monsters and other terrors that need to be stopped
[2023-10-30 09:08 PM] Deciusmus: Right. So maybe its just been a continual project since way back in the immediate aftermath of the Great War that has grown in fits and starts
[2023-10-30 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: (weird terrors from Urlich is important for the long-term plot arc of my game as that's where the underdark section is intended to be)
[2023-10-30 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: But, the wall is also the only part of Sembara that isn't defended by a river or an allied kingdom
[2023-10-30 09:11 PM] rsulfuratus: Dunmore at least was a fortified border town during the 1st hobgoblin war, presuming that is the setting for the stone titan one shot (never canonically had a year just "aftermath of great war")
[2023-10-30 09:12 PM] rsulfuratus: but actually probably makes sense for their not to be a wall there in 1570 or whenever - especially as in the 1550s Sembara is in pretty dire straights in general and might not have had resources for a huge wall project
[2023-10-30 09:13 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe the central section is first right after great war, and slowly grows north and south until it meets rivers or something
[2023-10-30 09:14 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure it matters a ton though the exact timing, unless relevant for your war pacing
[2023-10-30 09:14 PM] Deciusmus: No, it isn't relevant
[2023-10-30 09:14 PM] Deciusmus: Was just thinking about it as an aside
[2023-10-30 10:07 PM] Deciusmus: So here’s my rough notes… names will likely change..
    
[[Sentinel Range War]] - 1560ish. Mostly highland kingdoms, minimal impact on Sembara.
[2023-10-30 10:08 PM] Deciusmus: 1st hobgoblin war- 1570s. Dunmore and western sembara bear the brunt
[2023-10-30 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: Pushed back eventually - but a large reserve of hobgoblins ends up south of Urlich
[2023-10-30 10:12 PM] Deciusmus: 2nd hobgoblin war - the hobgoblins pushes east along the Enst valley. Lots of back and forth and borderland destruction. Mostly focused on the lands south of the Enst. Addermarch and Maseau cut off
[2023-10-30 10:16 PM] Deciusmus: Unsettled peace. Not sure how it comes about but hobgoblins end up settling in a wide band from the marches of enford to the borderlands east of addermarch. This is a tough time for Maseau in particular as trade through the hobgoblin lands is rare and highly taxed and there are many downsides to being a relatively weak power on the border of a hobgoblin kingdom
[2023-10-30 10:16 PM] Deciusmus: Addermarch does better, being protected somewhat by the hills and drawing closer to Tyrwingha
[2023-10-30 10:17 PM] Deciusmus: 3rd hobgoblin war started by Sembara at the behest of Maseau. Starts badly, but ends in a series of 3 summer campaigns that push the hobgoblins entirely west of enford.
[2023-10-30 10:22 PM] Deciusmus: At the end of the 3rd war there are still scattered remnants of the hobgoblin clans in the mountains south of Urlich but they don’t regain enough strength during the Cece years to be more than a nuscrnse in the rest of sembara
[2023-10-30 10:23 PM] Deciusmus: By 1740 the@hobgoblins might be entirely gone or there could@still be skirmishes now and then depending on what makes sense for current day
[2023-10-30 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: when is 3rd war?
[2023-10-30 10:23 PM] Deciusmus: 1646-1650
[2023-10-30 10:24 PM] Deciusmus: 2nd is 1590-1600
[2023-10-30 10:24 PM] Deciusmus: So the unsettled peace is 1600-1645
[2023-10-30 10:27 PM] Deciusmus: (I have set the stage in 1719 that the western army definitely does fight real skirmishes and battles most summers, but it could be the campaigns to wipe out hobgoblins which could have succeeded by 1730/1740)
[2023-10-30 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus: the main enemy in the addermarch campaign was hobgoblins based in the edge of the plaguelands south of addermarch
[2023-10-30 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: I think there is a whole different set of hobgoblins in the south
[2023-10-30 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: The remnants of the army that Derik III defeated in 1549
[2023-10-30 10:30 PM] rsulfuratus: could actually construct a scenario then where the plagueland hobgoblins and the urlich hobgoblins are actually bitter enemies, and the urlich hobgoblins keep maseau around as a buffer
[2023-10-30 10:30 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe one of the goals of the 2nd hobgoblin war is to break through the settled lands and reunite with the southern hobgoblins
[2023-10-30 10:30 PM] Deciusmus: Ooh I like that better
[2023-10-30 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure the implications for aurbez and the march of andonne
[2023-10-30 10:33 PM] Deciusmus: The plague land hobgoblins are also proposed in some notes as having an uneasy relationship that is not always entirely adversarial with the Auzbeg area- sort of a “we keep the worse stuff from moving west and in exchange you don’t follow our raiding parties back East”
[2023-10-30 10:34 PM] Deciusmus: But also I think in 1650 Andonne isn’t settled much
[2023-10-30 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus: right, but also that could work going way back actually. perhaps after their defeat the plagueland hobgoblins are actually kind of less interested in expansion
[2023-10-30 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe they turn into like mad scientists or something, and mostly just want to keep to themselves in the plaguelands
[2023-10-30 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus: even as far back as the 1600s are making little side deals with the various loose collections of humans who settle on the edges of the plaguelands.
[2023-10-30 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus: when the expansionist faction of the urlich hobgoblins gains control they expand quick, but don't want to start a war with the mad scientists and keep some buffer countries around (who of course suffer a lot as they are paying tribute to two masters now)
[2023-10-30 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus: actually works with my addermarch lore as well since that was a splinter faction under the influence of a shadowfell warlock
[2023-10-30 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess this would mean i need to start figuring out what kind of ridiculous creation a bunch of mad scientist hobgoblins would make with a city full of living acidic ooze that could challenge a 17th level party
[2023-10-30 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: I think that all works well although I never envisioned Maseau as paying tribute to hobgoblins much
[2023-10-30 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: In the “dark years” 1600-1645, yes, but probably only to the Urlich ones
[2023-10-30 10:43 PM] Deciusmus: I think the plague lands hobgoblins might have made little side deals with folks in Aurbez and Andonne… but also I kinda like the vibe where many of these people don’t even know there is a hobgoblin kingdom of mad scientists down their
[2023-10-30 10:44 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe it isn’t even only / mostly hobgoblins. Honestly keeping a little mystery seems more fun
[2023-10-30 10:46 PM] Deciusmus: The key thing would be that the hobgoblins of the plague lands don’t seem to be interested in expansion or conquest except some random factions here and there
[2023-10-30 10:46 PM] Deciusmus: (And maybe most humans think that’s because it is only random factions)
[2023-10-30 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: And secondly the urlich hobgoblins were scared/hated/etc them enough to want a human buffer zone
[2023-10-30 10:49 PM] Deciusmus: Actually this works well for the Andonne area as well — the early 1600s see a lot of the refugees who were packed into the Maseau/Enst valley fleeing south, away from the hobgoblins
[2023-10-30 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think that works fine
[2023-10-30 10:53 PM] Deciusmus: And perhaps a similar influx of refugees from the Sembaran borderlands to addermarch as well. So addermarch and Maseau really develop as much more independent places in the 1600-1650 time, and then when Cece sweeps west the borderlands are left kinda empty no man’s land
