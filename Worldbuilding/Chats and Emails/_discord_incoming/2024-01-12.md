# Discord DM – 2024-01-12

[2024-01-12 09:51 AM] rsulfuratus: I mostly have a lot of real work to do today but I did make a few bugfix changes to the python hooks, and it looks like I have slugification and relative links working correctly
    
    this is pushed as export_vault.py in taelgar-utils
    
    poking around, I am seeing a lot of visual bugs, mostly having to do with quirks of obsidian markdown (e.g., sometimes the callout boxes turn into code blocks)
    
    there are also the annoyances like pages with `title` frontmatter set to Lord or Queen, pages without an H1 (which get a slugified name instead of title case or whatever), (DR:: ) display tags, obsolete dview inline code, code blocks not wrapped with `%%`Campaign:None`%%`
    
    the question for me is: which of these should be considered bugs that need to be fixed in obsidian, which are bugs but will be cleaned for display, and which should be considered conversion issues that the python hook will handle?
    
    so far I've only tackled links. so far I consider things like [[Cosomology/Echo Realms/Feywild]] to be a bug but my code fixes it; I consider things like broken links to [[The Battle of Tokra]] instead of the [[Battle of Tokra]] to be a bug but I don't fix in
    
    I am likely to tackle the `title` frontmatter issue and the (DR: )) issue next, as those are both definitely visual conversion requirements
    
    missing H1, various display bugs in the summary boxes, untranslated inline dview code, and code blocks I'm less certain
[2024-01-12 09:55 AM] Deciusmus: I would be careful about changing anything that
    (a) looks like a bug in obisidian as well (i.e. either of your bad links)
    (b) anything inside the generated header
[2024-01-12 09:57 AM] Deciusmus: I have a few tweaks to the generate header code (baked into the same logic that static-ifies it for export) to make the callouts work better on mkdocs
[2024-01-12 09:58 AM] Deciusmus: mostly there are issues with callouts 
    
    ```
    >` sss
    sss
    >` sss
    ```
    
    or 
    
    ```
    >` ssss
    >`>` sss
    >` ss
    ```
    
    where MkDocs prefers
    
    ```
    >` sss
    >` sss
    >` sss
    ```
    
    Or
    
    ```
    >` sss
    >` >` sss
    >` >` sss
    ```
[2024-01-12 09:58 AM] Deciusmus: But that is a lot easier to fix in the gen-header than anywhere else
[2024-01-12 10:02 AM] rsulfuratus: the callouts plugin doesn't support the obisidian style >`>`
[2024-01-12 10:02 AM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-81ACA.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:02 AM] Deciusmus: what do you think?
[2024-01-12 10:02 AM] Deciusmus: yeah, I fixed the javascript to generate >` >` rather than >`>`
[2024-01-12 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus: image is a little small imo
[2024-01-12 10:03 AM] Deciusmus: if you click it expands
[2024-01-12 10:04 AM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-44FE1.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:04 AM] Deciusmus: if you install the Image Toolkit plugin
[2024-01-12 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus: is this to support better image display with mkdocs?
[2024-01-12 10:05 AM] Deciusmus: Having the image in the frontmatter and then included in a standard place makes it a lot easier to control what happens in mkdocs
[2024-01-12 10:06 AM] Deciusmus: and actually also because I like the images smaller and clikable in obisidia as well
[2024-01-12 10:06 AM] rsulfuratus: obsidian doesn't really support proper alignment though or responsive display for smaller screens without a lot of fiddling with css
[2024-01-12 10:06 AM] rsulfuratus: what does that header look like if you make the obisidan window narrow?
[2024-01-12 10:07 AM] rsulfuratus: like 1/3 your screen or something
[2024-01-12 10:07 AM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-BBD32.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:07 AM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-4F53F.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:08 AM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-35BFB.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:09 AM] Deciusmus: it works by setting the image as 
    
    image|right|300
    
    and then with a custom CSS style for "right" images
[2024-01-12 10:09 AM] Deciusmus: But I added a taelgar-fixes.css to the gitingore exclude list so functional css stuff can be easily shared
[2024-01-12 10:10 AM] Deciusmus: the bigger issue in making the bio blocks look nice is that the location stuff sometimes gets really long
[2024-01-12 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus: I think that I would be more interested in getting a nice website set up with proper navigation and fixing bugs before tackling images. i need to think about images a bit. I do think having an image file name stored in frontmatter would be very useful for lots of things
[2024-01-12 10:14 AM] Deciusmus: The very first thing I ran into when getting the website is frustration and how bad the images look
[2024-01-12 10:14 AM] Deciusmus: I hate the default bio block on the default website that is then followed by a **gianormous** image soon after
[2024-01-12 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus: but that is mostly just because we never really set image sizes
[2024-01-12 10:16 AM] Deciusmus: Partially, but I think also it is hard to make things looking nice if there isn't a consistent place on the page for the image.
[2024-01-12 10:16 AM] Deciusmus: or more specifically the image really looks a lot better if it is inside the bio block, and having it inside the bio block makes it easy to style via css
[2024-01-12 10:17 AM] Deciusmus: but it is very difficult to make it appear inside the bio block in mkdocs but outside the bio block in obisidian as images are not well enough defined in our structure right now
[2024-01-12 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus: i don't know, at the moment image usage feels way too random
[2024-01-12 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus: i think it is hard to standardize
[2024-01-12 10:19 AM] Deciusmus: I dunno, I have lots of npcs that are not that much more than a bio block and an image
[2024-01-12 10:19 AM] Deciusmus: lots of cases where the images are not part of the bio block, i.e. random pages or something, but I don't think it is random at all
[2024-01-12 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus: right we just have totally different styles is the problem
[2024-01-12 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus: i basially only have images for a small number of npcs and usually people with dense pages
[2024-01-12 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus: I don't think i have any npcs (except a few kenku where i was enjoying playing around with getting kenku to work with midjourney) that are just image + bioblock
[2024-01-12 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus: and for many of my npcs it actually makes a ton more sense for the image to be in the "description" section
[2024-01-12 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus: i've tried like 5 times to standardize npc pages and ultimately have just decided it doesn't work because i tend not to just invent npcs outside of a game context, so the information i record about them is widely varying not based even on importance but just kind of randomness. if i'm doing random worldbuilding it is almost always geography, not people
[2024-01-12 10:23 AM] Deciusmus: I personally like say the Caelynn page  a lot better with the image in the bio block than the description. It just feels more natural, especially with a lightbox effect
[2024-01-12 10:24 AM] Deciusmus: But really I have a lot of pages like this
![[../_discord_assets/image-735B5.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:24 AM] Deciusmus: which I strongly prefer to this
![[../_discord_assets/image-B43DD.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: right. i think the correct approach though is not try to standarize
[2024-01-12 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: have a bioblock_image or something frontmatter that if set gives you the first thing
[2024-01-12 10:25 AM] Deciusmus: well, I don't see any value in having an image: in the frontmatter that is ignored
[2024-01-12 10:25 AM] Deciusmus: but otherwise, what are we disagreeing about?
[2024-01-12 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus: i don't necessarily want npc images in headers
[2024-01-12 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus: (sorry bioblocks)
[2024-01-12 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus: but i don't care what you do with your npcs
[2024-01-12 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus: and it is isn't like i hate it
[2024-01-12 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus: so you can set bioblock_image: profile.png and get your headers
[2024-01-12 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus: and i can leave it blank and have an image in the note
[2024-01-12 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus: at some point i might have a different idea for images but i don't think it makes sense to try to "solve" images in their entirty since it feels to me quite complicated
[2024-01-12 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus: have you tested the mkdocs-glightbox plugin btw?
[2024-01-12 10:29 AM] Deciusmus: yeah it works great
[2024-01-12 10:30 AM] Deciusmus: that's what started me on this path
[2024-01-12 10:33 AM] Deciusmus: I actually like this better:
![[../_discord_assets/image-A39E8.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:33 AM] Deciusmus: but it is way harder to make work via frontmatter
[2024-01-12 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah but if the obisidian css supports alignment that can be translated to mkdocs, maybe it is fine to just have to make things look nice in obsidian
[2024-01-12 10:37 AM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-01-12 10:38 AM] Deciusmus: if you grab my css, the above is just
![[../_discord_assets/image-D786E.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:38 AM] Deciusmus: and then 
    
    img`[alt*="right"]` {
        float: right;    
        margin-left: 1rem;
        margin-right: 1rem;
        margin-top: 0;
    }
[2024-01-12 10:38 AM] Deciusmus: mkdocs supports the 300 piece automatically
[2024-01-12 10:39 AM] Deciusmus: having a lightbox (either the mkdocs plugin or the obsidian image toolkit) installed is crucial, so you can clck to zoom
[2024-01-12 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: I haven't really messed around with getting the style I like in mkdocs for bio blocks though
[2024-01-12 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus: well roamlinks supports the 300 piece automatically
[2024-01-12 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus: or whatever native link translation mkdocs does
[2024-01-12 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: I believe it becomes the alt-text for the image
[2024-01-12 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: and there is some magic css
[2024-01-12 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: but I'm not totally sure
[2024-01-12 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus: roamlinks converts it to {width = 300}
[2024-01-12 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus: is there are reason you use image|align|size instead of e.g. image|size,align?
[2024-01-12 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus: i guess for the css
[2024-01-12 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: I don't thik size,align works? are you saying mkdocs does something with it?
[2024-01-12 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: i.e. sets float: x automatically
[2024-01-12 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: or I mean romlinks
[2024-01-12 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus: no, it would just be easier to parse into:
    `[image]`(link){width = size}{align = left}
[2024-01-12 10:43 AM] Deciusmus: but that doesn't do any good in obisidian
[2024-01-12 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus: right, that is why i was asking if the css could parse that syntax
[2024-01-12 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus: but i guess it cant
[2024-01-12 10:44 AM] Deciusmus: it breaks the obisidian sizing
[2024-01-12 10:44 AM] Deciusmus: the css does but obsidian doesn't now how to size the image anymore
[2024-01-12 10:44 AM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-51B65.png]]
[2024-01-12 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus: ah okay
[2024-01-12 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: the only problem with [[image.png|right|300]] is that is breaks alt text since you overload it for alignment. which is not i guess the worst thing
[2024-01-12 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus: it would be easy to extend the roamlinsk parser I'm using the export_vault.py to add that alignment from alt text as long as we never use alt text for anything but alignment
[2024-01-12 10:47 AM] Deciusmus: this works as well
    ![[caelynn-portrait.png|portrait of Caelynn|right|300]]
[2024-01-12 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus: roamlinks won't parse that correctly
[2024-01-12 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: but I think conceptually we are not actually going to set real alt text
[2024-01-12 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: are you sure?
[2024-01-12 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: I was pretty sure it parsed
    ![[caelynn-portrait.png|right|300]]
[2024-01-12 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: how is 
    ![[caelynn-portrait.png|portrait of Caelynn|right|300]] different?
[2024-01-12 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: this is the regex, you can test yourself: `\`[\`[(.*?)(\#.*?)?(?:\|(`[\D]``[^\|\]]+`[\d]`*))?(?:\|(\d+)(?:x(\d+))?)?\]`\]``
[2024-01-12 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: in either case the "actual" alt text is portrait of Caelynn|right
[2024-01-12 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: no, it parses from the end
[2024-01-12 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: I mean in obisidian
[2024-01-12 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: right i'm saying in roamlinks you get file = "caelynn-portrait.png|portrait of Caelynn"
[2024-01-12 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus: which of course won't work
[2024-01-12 10:50 AM] Deciusmus: ah
[2024-01-12 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus: could change that since i'm not actually using roamlinks plugin, i'm just using their wikilinks parser class
[2024-01-12 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus: but it gets a bit annoying
[2024-01-12 10:51 AM] Deciusmus: I mean, if you are making changes, it would be a lot nicer to set a CSS class rather than alt-text
[2024-01-12 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus: right i can easily set `{ align=left }` or `{ align=right}`
[2024-01-12 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: you don't want to set align, you want to set { class =  }
[2024-01-12 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: I think
[2024-01-12 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: because it might be more than just an alignment
[2024-01-12 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus: you don't want to use https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/images/#image-alignment-left?
[2024-01-12 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: there were some issues I had with that, I am not 100% sure what
[2024-01-12 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus: setting custom css is going to get incredibly annoying unless we just don't care at all about small screens though
[2024-01-12 10:53 AM] Deciusmus: it is more flexible to do
    { .name }
[2024-01-12 10:53 AM] Deciusmus: which adds .name as a css class to the element
[2024-01-12 10:53 AM] Deciusmus: which makes it very easy to style
[2024-01-12 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: but it is probably better to see what looks nice in mkdocs first
[2024-01-12 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: part of this has to do with figuring out the right mkdocs look, and then how close that is to obsidian
[2024-01-12 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: i.e. to get a wikipedia style look
    
    almost certainly a different strategy would be needed because the image would have to be in frontmatter in order to insert it into the bio block
![[../_discord_assets/image-74A7E.png]]
[2024-01-12 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-01-12 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus: but i also think that there are some advantages to letting the obsidian style be a little loose and doing style conversion in code
[2024-01-12 11:02 AM] Deciusmus: css style yes sure
[2024-01-12 11:03 AM] Deciusmus: and markdown ->` html, sure. But I don't think it makes sense to say parse the entire markdown and try to identify if an image should or sholdnt move somewhere
[2024-01-12 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus: why not? that is pretty easy to do and if example, the assumption is that an person page with only one image should be processed in x way
[2024-01-12 11:04 AM] Deciusmus: I don't think that is a good assumption though
[2024-01-12 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus: Well, okay, then it is harder to do
[2024-01-12 11:05 AM] Deciusmus: I prefer declarative to magical
[2024-01-12 11:06 AM] Deciusmus: i.e. I don't want to have the mkdocs flow do something weird. What if the one image I put on a page is a scene of a battle? Or something that was found? Should mkdocs even know that something is a "person"?
[2024-01-12 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus: I mean fair enough. My counter argument is that if the only way for the website to look good is for every note to be formatted perfectly in obsidian the website is never going to look good
[2024-01-12 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus: Reformatting notes is pretty much always my lowest priority task and so is never actually finished
[2024-01-12 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus: In any case, my first goal is to fix navigation/page titles, and then to reformat (DR:: ) tags
[2024-01-12 11:12 AM] Deciusmus: yeah, although reformatting DR tags is its own can of worms if we ever get back to the dates stuff
[2024-01-12 11:13 AM] Deciusmus: but a simple easy cleanup is certainly sensible
[2024-01-12 11:14 AM] Deciusmus: I actually have mixed feelings about using DR tags at all, as opposed to just raw parsing the date, because the timeline code in JS doesn't care, it actually looks at all list items and then checks each list item for a date field. But it would be almost as easy to do something else
[2024-01-12 11:14 AM] Deciusmus: but not super interested in looking at tht right now so suggest you do whatever
[2024-01-12 11:25 AM] Deciusmus: anyway what I actually care about is a nice website bio block so I was going to mess around with that to the extend I do anything
[2024-01-12 11:26 AM] rsulfuratus: Yeah, that is all in the hands of the export code
[2024-01-12 11:26 AM] Deciusmus: I don't follow what your source + build directories are supposed to be
[2024-01-12 11:27 AM] Deciusmus: or more specifially, why do i have to set source and output
[2024-01-12 11:27 AM] Deciusmus: isn't that already in mkdocs?
[2024-01-12 11:28 AM] Deciusmus: are you even using mkdocs in your export_vault?
[2024-01-12 11:28 AM] Deciusmus: ah, I see, you are not intending it to be triggered by mkdocs at all.
[2024-01-12 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus: no, it is triggered by mkdocs
[2024-01-12 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus: export_hook.py reads files from source, and writes to output
[2024-01-12 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus: it builds a new directory structure for slugification
[2024-01-12 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus: right now it makes the nav look really bad
[2024-01-12 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus: output in website.json has to match the mkdocs source
[2024-01-12 11:31 AM] Deciusmus: how is it triggered by mkdocs?
[2024-01-12 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus: make a scripts folder in your mkdocs directory and then put:
    ```
    hooks:
      - scripts/export_vault.py
    ```
[2024-01-12 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus: in the mkdocs.yml
[2024-01-12 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus: then mkdocs serve will run export_vault.py on build
[2024-01-12 11:32 AM] Deciusmus: I thoght you needed an on_xx function
[2024-01-12 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus: nope
[2024-01-12 11:32 AM] Deciusmus: wouldn't it be nicer though?
[2024-01-12 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus: no that is what I hate about roamlinks
[2024-01-12 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus: because it triggers on markdown, it has to search the directory tree again for every single md file
[2024-01-12 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus: my code run is like 45 seconds, if you use roamlinks to get rel paths it takes like 180
[2024-01-12 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus: the hooks run before mkdocs build
[2024-01-12 11:33 AM] Deciusmus: I didn't mean the link-replacement, it is def better to do that wholesale
[2024-01-12 11:33 AM] Deciusmus: the other stuff
[2024-01-12 11:33 AM] Deciusmus: i.e. I did this
    def on_page_markdown(markdown, files, page, config, `**`kwargs):
        config_hooks = config.get(
            "extra", {"hooks": {"campaign": "clee"}}
        ).get("hooks", {"campaign": "clee"})
    
        markdown = strip_campaign_content(markdown, "clee")
        markdown = strip_comments(markdown)
    
        return markdown
[2024-01-12 11:34 AM] Deciusmus: (stealing your strip code)
[2024-01-12 11:34 AM] Deciusmus: to not have `%%` litering my testing areas
[2024-01-12 11:34 AM] rsulfuratus: that is nicer for live preview for sure
[2024-01-12 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus: i think for actually serving it doesn't matter
[2024-01-12 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus: but it might be cleaner to pull out things that don't need directory access
[2024-01-12 11:35 AM] Deciusmus: right, by nicer I just meant easier to maintain
[2024-01-12 11:35 AM] Deciusmus: also conceptually nicer to have the config in mkdocs.yaml extra
[2024-01-12 11:36 AM] Deciusmus: rather than a separate json file
[2024-01-12 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2024-01-12 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus: everything that parses markdown is just a function anyway so it isn't hard to refactor
[2024-01-12 11:39 AM] Deciusmus: using something like https://www.mkdocs.org/dev-guide/plugins/#on_files to modify what files are built rather than a directory copy is probably a lot easier
[2024-01-12 11:41 AM] Deciusmus: and actually the right approach for link update would probably be to build the index on_startup and modify the page in the on markdown but also likely not worth the trouble given most "live edits" testing doesn't require changing the links (and it is easy enough to type the markdown syntax if needed)
[2024-01-12 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus: i don't really see what the advantage of that would be to be honest
[2024-01-12 11:52 AM] Deciusmus: the only advantage is it works with mkdocs serve. but like I said, probably not worth it
[2024-01-12 11:53 AM] Deciusmus: although I guess the slugifying bit is complicated
[2024-01-12 11:53 AM] Deciusmus: it would be nice if you had slugifying optional
[2024-01-12 11:53 AM] Deciusmus: roamlinks is so slow I'd rather not use it, but I dont necessarily want to deal with the fallout from slugifying
[2024-01-12 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus: it is easy to make slugifying optional but a bit more annoying to make the file copy optional
[2024-01-12 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus: although actually if you make source = output in the json it should just overrite in place with relative links
[2024-01-12 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus: i can make it an option later but I think it should work if you just change: `['file']` to `['orig']` in 
    ```
    filename = str(self.path_dict`[filename]``['file']`)
    filename = str(self.path_dict`[parts`[-1]]`['file']`)
    ```
[2024-01-12 11:58 AM] Deciusmus: have meeting now, but might mess around a bit during lunch
[2024-01-12 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus: and set SOURCE = OUTPUT = mkdocs "docs" directory
[2024-01-12 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus: ah hmm actually a bit more complicated
[2024-01-12 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a version with optional slugification
[2024-01-12 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus: have not tested what happens if you set source = build in the config
[2024-01-12 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus: the file link processing seems super-slow, is there a way to make that optional?
[2024-01-12 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus: should it be taking >`5 minutes?
[2024-01-12 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus: nvm
[2024-01-12 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus: you hard-coded the startingn point, I use index not main
[2024-01-12 12:42 PM] Deciusmus: ah, the notice just wasn't going away, right?
[2024-01-12 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-01-12 12:43 PM] Deciusmus: if it never runs, it doesn't hide the notice
[2024-01-12 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus: added a prompt to specify file to start checks from, and also made it optional (so if you dont specify a file root check doesn't run)
[2024-01-12 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus: is there a way to get the errors out?
[2024-01-12 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus: it says errors: 5 but I don't know what files they are
[2024-01-12 12:54 PM] Deciusmus: console log
[2024-01-12 01:16 PM] Deciusmus: How hard would it be to change the link code so it didn’t create broken links? Or does it already not?
[2024-01-12 01:16 PM] rsulfuratus: it shouldn't create broken links
[2024-01-12 01:17 PM] Deciusmus: I haven’t tried it yet, just got off a meeting
[2024-01-12 01:17 PM] rsulfuratus: well, i haven't checked, but that is the expected behavior of roamlinks
[2024-01-12 01:17 PM] Deciusmus: Roam links leaves them as [[]]
[2024-01-12 01:17 PM] rsulfuratus: ah
[2024-01-12 01:17 PM] rsulfuratus: okay
[2024-01-12 01:17 PM] Deciusmus: I want it to just turn into plain text
[2024-01-12 01:18 PM] Deciusmus: Ie if you have:
    [[session 82|killed]] I want to just get killed
[2024-01-12 01:31 PM] rsulfuratus: do you have an example page with an alias that doesn't have a link?
[2024-01-12 01:31 PM] rsulfuratus: or this is just generated from your parsing of unrooted pages
[2024-01-12 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: I've been in meetings. Now I am not even 100% sure if it was roamlinks vs ezliks that left them behind
[2024-01-12 01:32 PM] Deciusmus: An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realms is an example
[2024-01-12 01:33 PM] Deciusmus: I have a typo in 
    [[Lord Umbraeth| Gloomshaper]],
[2024-01-12 01:33 PM] Deciusmus: it should be
    [[Lord Umbraeth| Gloomshaper]],
[2024-01-12 01:33 PM] Deciusmus: and I thought I saw it come through as
    [[Lord Umbraeth| Gloomshaper]],
    
    rather than
    Gloomshaper
[2024-01-12 01:35 PM] rsulfuratus: moving export code to: https://github.com/tsackton/taelgarverse-v2
[2024-01-12 01:35 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a fix that removes [[]] from broken links
[2024-01-12 01:36 PM] rsulfuratus: set up to have taelgar repo as a submodule but you can fork it however you like if you have a different setup
[2024-01-12 01:36 PM] rsulfuratus: not currently running actions to actually serve a website
[2024-01-12 01:55 PM] Deciusmus: So your workflow is basically
    1. sync repo
    2. run export, where docs\ is empty
    3. run mkdocs serve which populates docs
[2024-01-12 01:55 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-01-12 01:55 PM] rsulfuratus: just pushed an update to export_vault.py that will clean docs for you
[2024-01-12 01:55 PM] Deciusmus: how hard is making glob pattern work
[2024-01-12 01:56 PM] rsulfuratus: for cleaning docs?
[2024-01-12 01:56 PM] Deciusmus: for copying
[2024-01-12 01:56 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. what I really want is to have Campaigns\Dunmar* ignored
[2024-01-12 01:56 PM] Deciusmus: and then all those links are broken
[2024-01-12 01:56 PM] Deciusmus: so the link code cleans them to raw text rather than broken links
[2024-01-12 01:57 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is basically a change in build_md_list to use a better glob pattern
[2024-01-12 01:57 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah 
    # skip files that start with a dot or underscore; will eventually fix this to a true ignore list
[2024-01-12 01:57 PM] Deciusmus: the other change would be a flag to only copy rooted: true
[2024-01-12 01:58 PM] rsulfuratus: that is much easier since i already parse the metadata
[2024-01-12 01:58 PM] rsulfuratus: but risks creating broken links
[2024-01-12 01:58 PM] Deciusmus: I'd write it by reading the source file during build_md_list
[2024-01-12 01:58 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-01-12 01:58 PM] Deciusmus: sure, you read the files twice, but it seems like for ~1500-2000 files that should be ok
[2024-01-12 01:59 PM] Deciusmus: because then you don't have broken links
[2024-01-12 01:59 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, if you don't care about broken links there is no need to do anything, mkdocs has very good glob pattern support
[2024-01-12 01:59 PM] rsulfuratus: actually you wouldn't need to read the files twice if you just store text and frontmatter in md_files
[2024-01-12 01:59 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2024-01-12 02:00 PM] rsulfuratus: for skipping campaign/dunmar
[2024-01-12 02:01 PM] Deciusmus: What I mean is that if I had the rooted: true feature I could:
    1. only copy rooted: true
    2. there are a handful of session notes that get rooted, so they would be copied, but 99% of the dunmar stuff would not be copied
    3. use an mkdocs glob pattern to exclude Campaign\Dunmar from the final website
[2024-01-12 02:01 PM] Deciusmus: You'd end up with like 3 pages that have broken links to session notes
[2024-01-12 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-01-12 02:02 PM] Deciusmus: if it really annoyed me I could manually fix those rooted: true pages.
[2024-01-12 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i am adding the skip on rooted right now
[2024-01-12 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: the other feature that would not be a full glob but would actually be just as good is just a "my campaign path" setting, which, if set, would mean that nothing from Campaigns\ is copied unless it is
    * Mechanics
    * the my campaign path folder
[2024-01-12 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: my current mkdocs glob is
[2024-01-12 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: exclude_docs: |
      Campaigns/*
      !Campaigns/Cleenseau*
      !Campaigns/Mechanics
      !Campaigns/Player's Guide.md
[2024-01-12 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: but moving the plaguelands and one shots files to their own folder and just special casing Campaigns is just as good as that
[2024-01-12 02:05 PM] Deciusmus: a feature to exclude ~xxx~ files would be nice as well
[2024-01-12 02:07 PM] rsulfuratus: just to clarify, the rooted stuff works by setting frontmatter `rooted: True` if the page is reached, so the correct behavior is to only copy files where rooted is True
[2024-01-12 02:07 PM] rsulfuratus: ?
[2024-01-12 02:08 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2024-01-12 02:10 PM] Deciusmus: the submodule doesn't have fantasy calendar
[2024-01-12 02:10 PM] Deciusmus: do you always just type a date?
[2024-01-12 02:11 PM] Deciusmus: nor plugins, which is more annoying
[2024-01-12 02:11 PM] rsulfuratus: for export, yes. it also makes the export noticably faster
[2024-01-12 02:11 PM] Deciusmus: I think I fixed that bug btw
[2024-01-12 02:11 PM] rsulfuratus: ah okay
[2024-01-12 02:11 PM] Deciusmus: the fantasy calendar "get current date" code is (a) slow and (b) has a nasty memory leak
[2024-01-12 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: I was running through 4GB of memory trying to export everything and obsidian would cras
[2024-01-12 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: Now the export reads the date once from fantasy calendar and then stores it, rather than for each file
[2024-01-12 02:13 PM] rsulfuratus: but for the submodule you just need to copy your .obsidian directory to the location of the submodule
[2024-01-12 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I know
[2024-01-12 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: also need to copy main.md
[2024-01-12 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: although given how the website side works, having a clee_index.md that is not gitignored is probably fine
[2024-01-12 02:32 PM] rsulfuratus: keep_only_rooted now should work
[2024-01-12 02:34 PM] rsulfuratus: there is also the option to copy a home page from templates/home.md
[2024-01-12 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: (just remove the home_source if you don't want to do that
[2024-01-12 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: right but no reason that can't be in obsidian right? the path could be taelgar\clee_main.md
[2024-01-12 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2024-01-12 02:35 PM] rsulfuratus: that will just rename it from taelgar\clee_main.md to taelgar\index.md
[2024-01-12 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: right, which is exactly what I want
[2024-01-12 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: i would slightly prefer if you keep the clee_main.md page in campaigns/cleeansau actually
[2024-01-12 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: that was my plan, actually
[2024-01-12 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that works well
[2024-01-12 02:37 PM] rsulfuratus: then you can set the home_source to whatever, and that file will get copied to taelgar/index.md before link cleanup happens
[2024-01-12 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: does your code copy or move?
[2024-01-12 02:37 PM] rsulfuratus: copy
[2024-01-12 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: that makes it a little bit more annoying to have it in campaigns because it will show up twice
[2024-01-12 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: unless I change the rooting stuff to not set it rooted: true
[2024-01-12 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: the reason for copy is that I want to build a nice home page with with a banner image and such
[2024-01-12 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: which will probably need to be auto-built from a template
[2024-01-12 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: right, copy makes sense
[2024-01-12 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: oh, wait, it is gine
[2024-01-12 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: `*`fine
[2024-01-12 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: nothing links to it so I can glob it out via mkdocs exclude_docs
[2024-01-12 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-01-12 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: btw i did a test build with setting the player's guide as the root and there are quite a lot of campaign things that get picked up
[2024-01-12 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, the rooting stuff depends on the excludesRoot: `[xxx]` to be set judiciously
[2024-01-12 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: there are lots of links from various random pages into the dunmari session notes
[2024-01-12 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: and once you get into the dunmari stuff, the links are so dense that you find 80% of it
[2024-01-12 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: I fixed it by setting excludeRoot: `[clee]` on the ~15 session notes that are the main entry points, plus a few key things like mirror, vidnistranja,
[2024-01-12 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: it does seem like having a proper glob for building the md file list from the taelgar repo would be helpful then, though, as you could (mostly) not use excludesRoot then
[2024-01-12 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: well, the problem is that i don't want the cross links
[2024-01-12 02:44 PM] rsulfuratus: right but if the files aren't in the source files dict then the links now get removed
[2024-01-12 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: but I'd still get a page for say, Alesh
[2024-01-12 02:46 PM] rsulfuratus: right i see
[2024-01-12 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: I don't love the rooted stuff. Honestly a better strategy would probably be to just delete Campaigns first, then run the rooted checks
[2024-01-12 02:48 PM] Deciusmus: I'm going to update the campaigns directory so that only Players' Gide is in the root
[2024-01-12 02:49 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2024-01-12 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: also would ideally remove this line from Player's Guide:
    
    For more information about character creation and game mechanics, please see the [[Character Creation Guide]].
[2024-01-12 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: that seems more appriopriate in a campaign homepage, rather than a shared players guide, as we have different house rules
[2024-01-12 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that's fine to delete
[2024-01-12 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: so it is fairly simple to write a quick python script that would delete files from the source directory based on gitignore syntax
[2024-01-12 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: so rather than manually deleting stuff, the build could be:
    1. pull updates from taelgar repo
    2. run prep_source.py
    3. open repo, run prep_for_export
    4. push / mkdocs serve
[2024-01-12 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-01-12 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: that would be nicest
[2024-01-12 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: because that solves (i think) all the rooted issues. Basically no need for excluding rooted because the dunmar or mawar stuff just auto-breaks chains
[2024-01-12 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: I'm about to test
[2024-01-12 03:07 PM] rsulfuratus: just added a prep_source_dir.py script to taelgarverse-v2
[2024-01-12 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: it takes two positional arguments, first arg is a file in gitignore spec, second is a root dir
    
    anything in the root dir that matches the gitignore spec will be deleted
    
    `--dry-run` or `-n` does a dry run
    `--verbose` or `-v` prints what it is deleting
[2024-01-12 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: relies on the pathspec python module for parsing gitignore
[2024-01-12 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: syntax
[2024-01-12 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: I assume this is robust but haven't tested
[2024-01-12 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: it also never deletes .obsidian directories
[2024-01-12 03:09 PM] rsulfuratus: still testing the last thing, chatgpt gave me code for this i'm not totally sure about
[2024-01-12 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: I'm doing actual work ostly so slow going
[2024-01-12 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: but I am checking whether rooted: true ends up pretty good having deleted the dunmar, etc dirs
[2024-01-12 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: you need a requirements.txt for your script
[2024-01-12 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah was going to add that to the main mkdocs repo so you can also install mkdocs and plugins but haven't yet
[2024-01-12 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: File "C:\Program Files\Python311\Lib\site-packages\slugify.py", line 24, in slugify
        unicode(
        ^^^^^^^
[2024-01-12 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: pip install python-slugify should get that
[2024-01-12 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: i installed slugify not python-slugify
[2024-01-12 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: this worked
[2024-01-12 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: lots of errors like
    
    er\Greater Dunmar\Realms\Dunmar\Western Dunmar\Western Dunmar.md in directory docs
    Cannot find Gazetteer\Greater Dunmar\Dunmari Basin\Dunmari Basin.md in directory docs
    Cannot find Gazetteer\Greater Dunmar\Dunmari Basin\Dunmari Basin.md in directory docs
    Cannot find Gazetteer\Greater Dunmar\Darba Highlands\~Darba Coastal Mountains~.md in directory docs
    Cannot find Gazetteer\Greater Dunmar\Dunmari Basin\Dunmari Basin.md in directory docs

    Cannot find Gazetteer\Greater Dunmar\Dunmari Basin\Dunmari Basin.md in directory docs
    Cannot find Gazetteer\Greater Dunmar\Darba Highlands\~Darba Coastal Mountains~.md in directory docs
[2024-01-12 03:20 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i've been meaning to make that less verbose
[2024-01-12 03:21 PM] Deciusmus: but they exist
[2024-01-12 03:21 PM] rsulfuratus: hmm. this should be just using the exact parser from roamlinks...but let me check
[2024-01-12 03:23 PM] rsulfuratus: ah
[2024-01-12 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: I can confirm the link stripping works! 🙂
[2024-01-12 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: but I have 0 links
[2024-01-12 03:23 PM] rsulfuratus: there is one line in the build md where I used string parsing instead of pathlib to handle paths
[2024-01-12 03:23 PM] rsulfuratus: that is probably breaking on windows
[2024-01-12 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: I fixed the place in my code where i relied on posix paths
[2024-01-12 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: was it this?
         # slugified full path
                slug = os.path.join(Path(*`[slugify(part) for part in relative_path_parents]`), slug_file_name)
                orig = os.path.join(file.relative_to(path).parent, file.name)
[2024-01-12 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: i changed those, didn't seem to fix it
[2024-01-12 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: no, not that
[2024-01-12 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: line above
[2024-01-12 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: where I split on "/"
[2024-01-12 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: relative_path_parents = str(file.relative_to(path).parent).split(os.path.sep)
[2024-01-12 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: yes that
[2024-01-12 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: didn't fix it either
[2024-01-12 03:32 PM] rsulfuratus: so it could also be that roamlinks uses "/"
[2024-01-12 03:33 PM] rsulfuratus: change `if '/' in filename:` to `if os.path.sep in filename`
[2024-01-12 03:34 PM] rsulfuratus: because str(self.path_dict`[filename]``['file']`) should be returning a "system native" path
[2024-01-12 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: that fixed it
[2024-01-12 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: but it isn't quite right because I loose the http checking
[2024-01-12 03:35 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-01-12 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: also still some case-sensitive issues, i.e. it can't find "elves"
[2024-01-12 03:35 PM] rsulfuratus: are you slugifying?
[2024-01-12 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: no, I guess that would fix it
[2024-01-12 03:36 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah the file checking is not case-insensitive
[2024-01-12 03:36 PM] rsulfuratus: relies on files being slugified
[2024-01-12 03:36 PM] Deciusmus: it doesn't fix links in home.md
[2024-01-12 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: hmm, it did for me
[2024-01-12 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: when copying from templates/home.md to taelgar/index.md
[2024-01-12 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, didn't seem to
[2024-01-12 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: it does that before building the source_files
[2024-01-12 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: is the file being copied?
[2024-01-12 03:39 PM] Deciusmus: I have something there; cannot 100% swear I didn't manually copy it in one of the attempts
[2024-01-12 03:39 PM] Deciusmus: I'm going to fix the JS statifcy to not break all the callout boxes and rerun everything
[2024-01-12 03:57 PM] Deciusmus: your prep script doesn't clean empty dirs. which is fine, but it is a bit confusing at first
[2024-01-12 04:01 PM] rsulfuratus: that is an easy change if desired. but empty dirs shouldn't get recreated by the export vault code so i didn't think it mattered
[2024-01-12 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: no, its fine
[2024-01-12 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: I just thought my gitignore or your script was wrong at first
[2024-01-12 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: because I glanced at the output and still saw the folders
[2024-01-12 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: ah, okay
[2024-01-12 04:03 PM] Deciusmus: the index.md seems to have been linked correctly
[2024-01-12 04:03 PM] Deciusmus: I might have been running an old version of your script
[2024-01-12 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: ok, now we are rolling.
[2024-01-12 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-4136E.png]]
[2024-01-12 04:05 PM] Deciusmus: but I don't know if I like the double callout
[2024-01-12 04:05 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm not sure I do either
[2024-01-12 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a lot of whitespace to the right. probably what would look the best but might be annoying to set up is to have two callouts arranged side-by-side, one with biographical info and one with location, where if the viewport gets too narrow they stack instead
[2024-01-12 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. something like: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/grids/#using-generic-grids
[2024-01-12 04:10 PM] Deciusmus: it would be good to update your prep script to copy 
    
    templates\assets\css to docs\assets\css
    templates\assets\js to docs\assets\js
[2024-01-12 04:10 PM] Deciusmus: custom css has to be inside docs
[2024-01-12 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: is there any reason not just to copy templates/assets to docs/assets?
[2024-01-12 04:12 PM] Deciusmus: no, that is probably better
[2024-01-12 04:13 PM] Deciusmus: actually better to copy templates\overrides to docs
[2024-01-12 04:13 PM] Deciusmus: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/
[2024-01-12 04:14 PM] Deciusmus: let me get something working first though
[2024-01-12 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: actual ignore what I said
[2024-01-12 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: pretty sure overrides is outside docs
[2024-01-12 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: overrides replaces stuff; extras adds stuff
[2024-01-12 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: but overrides can also add
[2024-01-12 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah but i think it is probably easier to use extras, no?
[2024-01-12 04:17 PM] Deciusmus: well, I was going to try to get backlinks to work
[2024-01-12 04:17 PM] Deciusmus: there is a backlinks plugin but material doesn't support it out of the box
[2024-01-12 04:27 PM] rsulfuratus: working a bit on page titles, do you prefer "The Green Sea Region" (with article) for the sidebar nav or "Green Sea Region" (without article)?
[2024-01-12 04:27 PM] Deciusmus: I don't have a strong feeling
[2024-01-12 05:06 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed an update to export_vault.py that fills in the title attribute for every note, so that all pages will have properly displayed and cased titles regardless of slugification of file names or other quirks. a few details
[2024-01-12 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: - i prefer yaml name to file name, so if there is a file with name: Robert but the file is Robert the Bandit, the nav link will be Robert not Robert the Bandit
[2024-01-12 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: - i add title if it exists, so Nayan Karnas will be Samraat Nayan Karnas in the nav sidebar
[2024-01-12 05:08 PM] rsulfuratus: - i consistently title case file names, to correct for slugification
[2024-01-12 05:08 PM] rsulfuratus: - i have not yet added section links or cleaned up the folder names in the nav, which will require, i suspect, autogenerating a literate nav md file or something like that
[2024-01-12 05:11 PM] rsulfuratus: I believe (1) and (2) are consistent with the name manager behavior; the only thing I am not trying to do is add articles, which doesn't seem worthwhile
[2024-01-12 05:11 PM] Deciusmus: makes sense
[2024-01-12 05:23 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-94CC1.png]]
[2024-01-12 05:25 PM] rsulfuratus: that is pretty nice
[2024-01-12 05:25 PM] rsulfuratus: it might be tricky to make it look nice with both 'busy' and 'nearly empty' whereabouts
[2024-01-12 05:26 PM] rsulfuratus: although looking at that I can also see the logic of a wikipedia style box on the right
[2024-01-12 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: The wikibox does not play that well with images
[2024-01-12 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: I like the right aligned image inline with the text
[2024-01-12 05:27 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, that's fair
[2024-01-12 05:27 PM] rsulfuratus: hey btw can you look out your window and see if you see nathaniel on your swings?
[2024-01-12 05:27 PM] rsulfuratus: he was planning on stopping by tonight
[2024-01-12 05:27 PM] rsulfuratus: he would be leaving brown just about now
[2024-01-12 05:28 PM] Deciusmus: I did not see him
[2024-01-12 05:28 PM] Deciusmus: I also like the wiki-style box, but I don't see any good way to make it work, at least not easily, withut embedded the image in the frontmatter
[2024-01-12 05:29 PM] Deciusmus: whereas the above basically just works with the |right|300 stuff we discussed earlier
[2024-01-12 05:29 PM] Deciusmus: I'm going to futz a bit more
[2024-01-12 05:30 PM] rsulfuratus: finding a good place to put pronunciation would also be nice
[2024-01-12 05:32 PM] rsulfuratus: this is imo too much white space, it looks weird:
![[../_discord_assets/image-0A0F3.png]]
[2024-01-12 05:32 PM] Deciusmus: the standard theme has tons of margin under the h1
[2024-01-12 05:32 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe just cutting that down would fix it
[2024-01-12 05:33 PM] rsulfuratus: but also I wonder if **Aygul** *(EYE-gool)*
[2024-01-12 05:33 PM] rsulfuratus: as H1 would work fine
[2024-01-12 05:33 PM] rsulfuratus: still might want to reduce margin
[2024-01-12 05:33 PM] rsulfuratus: but the margin looks okay to me when the next line is a biobox
[2024-01-12 05:37 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-2F0D4.png]]
[2024-01-12 05:38 PM] Deciusmus: looks a little messy to me
[2024-01-12 05:38 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah agreed
[2024-01-12 05:39 PM] rsulfuratus: Assume no sign of Nathaniel?
[2024-01-12 05:39 PM] Deciusmus: he is now in the tree
[2024-01-12 05:39 PM] rsulfuratus: Can you ask when he wants me to meet him?
[2024-01-12 05:41 PM] Deciusmus: he is going to knock on our door when he is ready to leave so I can tell you. he said "a few more minutes"
[2024-01-12 05:41 PM] rsulfuratus: No rush
[2024-01-12 05:44 PM] Deciusmus: this looks ok to me
![[../_discord_assets/image-E5BB7.png]]
[2024-01-12 05:47 PM] Deciusmus: Nathaniel leaving here now
[2024-01-12 05:48 PM] rsulfuratus: okay thanks
