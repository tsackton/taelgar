# Discord DM – 2024-09-04

[2024-09-04 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus: not sure if you are interested in this, but with the new D&D rules now available I've been thinking a bit about updating the set of playable species in Taelgar, both to bring homebrew species up to the new design and to have a bit more principled set of playable species (motivated by the new family campaign I'm starting and Isaac's friends wanting to make new Taelgar characters for the semi-defunct Great Library campaign). 
    
    thinking a little bit about it, my feelings are that there are really potentially four groups of species.
    
    1. standard species are species that are widespread, deeply integrated into worldbuilding, and straightforwardly available as PC options (but they don't have to be common, e.g. elves). I'd consider these to be: human, elf, dwarf, lizardfolk, halfling, stoneborn, kenku, centaur at the moment but could move other species here possibly.
    
    2. fey species are the large class of feywild natives that often find themselves on the material plane and would usually be viable PC options. These would include: satyr, "fae/fey" (which needs a little thought as to the generic "fey humanoid" species stat block), fairy (pixie/sprite), changelings, some kind of "beastfolk" options (e.g. haregon, owlin, tabaxi type species, but requires a bit of thought)
    
    3. "unusual" species are species with well-established lore and integrated into worldbuilding but that have complications that prevent them from being a straightforward PC option. orc, hobgoblin, goblin, bugbear, kobold, merfolk, gnome are the most obvious ones here. maybe shifter to represent lycanthropes.
    
    4. "rare" species are things that might be viable player options but are not integrated into worldbuilding. mostly things like the various "plane-touched" humans (aasimar, tiefling, genasi), or the dhampir/hexblood/reborn Ravenloft lineages, or the "underdark" species variants. maybe warforged
[2024-09-04 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus: my main interests at the moment are:
    (1) solidify the set of standard species and homebrew new versions of them
    (2) solidify the set of fey species but typically use published versions for them
    (3) make some decisions about what rare/unusual species would not disrupt the Taelgar vibe to include
[2024-09-04 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus: e.g., Nathaniel originally wanted to play an orc, which I decided was too complicated for the game I want to run, but in principle I could see an orc PC as being kind of an interesting option in the right campaign
[2024-09-04 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus: but, again, not sure if you care too much
[2024-09-04 10:21 AM] Deciusmus: I'm not massively interested in thinking about additional homebrew rules as my game probably has 2-3 years still to go and I have no plans to run anything small scale in Taelgar (i.e. if my game for Zachary's friends restarts, it would not be in Taelgar)
[2024-09-04 10:21 AM] Deciusmus: My main interest would be impact on worldbuilding
[2024-09-04 10:22 AM] Deciusmus: to the extent that there is any...
[2024-09-04 10:22 AM] Deciusmus: My instinct in games I run is to wait to homebrew stuff until people want it, but I can see how that doesn't work as well for your kids/their friends
[2024-09-04 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah it is particularly a challenge for Isaac's friends because they tend to be a lot more build-oriented than anyone else I run games for
[2024-09-04 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: so they always want to see the traits/features before they decide what to do
[2024-09-04 10:25 AM] Deciusmus: In general, I think there is a benefit to "less is more" in this space though. D&D has way too many playable species
[2024-09-04 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus: even if they just rebuild their existing characters I need dwarf, lizardfolk, (some kind of fey) for them, plus halfling, elf, human for my family game, so that is nearly all the most common options anyway (except for stoneborn which no one ever seems to want to play)
[2024-09-04 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i feel like there is a fair bit of tension between worldbuilding and what a lot of the people I run games for want here, so i'm trying to balance
[2024-09-04 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus: from a worldbuilding perspective adding more species gets to be quite annoying, so the humans + elder folk is a great setup
[2024-09-04 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus: and having diverse fey options seems like a good compromise to expand the playable species quite a bit with minimal worldbuilding impact
[2024-09-04 10:28 AM] Deciusmus: Yes, that makes a lot of sense to me
[2024-09-04 10:29 AM] Deciusmus: In particular, having a wide variety of fey species doesn't actually commit any of them to be "real species" with lore and stuff. There's no need for a defined community of taxabi to have a half-cat fey
[2024-09-04 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus: right, exactly. it is the obvious solution to any kind of "beastfolk" build
[2024-09-04 10:35 AM] rsulfuratus: the big things I'm not sure about that could impact worldbuliding are:
    (1) kobolds have always occupied a bit of weird place. i've used them a fair bit (mostly in the Great Library) campaign and they don't really work as a "typical evil" race (orcs, goblinoids). generally they've been regarded as a nuisance and sometimes a threat by humans nearby, but there is certainly room to expand kobold lore. adding kobolds to centaurs and kenku as "playable weird species not from the feywild" would give 9 species + fey options that feels pretty complete. 
    (2) there are a large number of D&D species that are basically plane-touched humans. i don't want these to have big communities and have lots of lore, but i'm not sure whether or not it would matter to allow e.g.  one-off aasimars with unique backstories that are fundamentally "human".
[2024-09-04 12:03 PM] Deciusmus: I think there is a place for kobolds as an interesting "other" species (to go along with kenku, merfolk, and centaurs in particular) and a "nuisance" but not "creation of the void mind" species seems like it could fill a niche
[2024-09-04 12:11 PM] Deciusmus: As to (2), I think sensible having some one-off stuff (which, actually, kinda fits in the lore via a "magical soul", especially for tielflings or aasimar
[2024-09-04 12:12 PM] Deciusmus: (and probably Gensasi as well)
[2024-09-04 12:14 PM] Deciusmus: if it were me I don't think I'd let anything outside of assimar/gensai/tieflings in though
[2024-09-04 12:14 PM] Deciusmus: for "plane touched" humans
[2024-09-04 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: Potential updated elf. Goal is to streamline a little bit (no need to repeat spell descriptions in the traits) and balance against PHB 2024 Elf. Could potentially use a couple more ritual choices, and the 5th level improvements for Elven Ritual Magic are maybe not strong/interesting enough.
[2024-09-04 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: ### Elves

    `**`Languages**: Elves long lifespan means they typically learn more languages than usual. You may select up to two additional languages beyond the three languages that all characters start with. Should you wish, you can exchange one or both of these language proficiencies for tool proficiencies. 
    
    As an Elf, you have these special traits.

    - `*`Elmerca's Gift*: You know the Prestidigitation cantrip. When you finish a long rest, you can replace that cantrip with a different cantrip from the Wizard spell list.

[2024-09-04 05:09 PM] rsulfuratus: PHB 2024 elves get this instead of ritual magic + firstborn gift:

[2024-09-04 05:09 PM] rsulfuratus: (so pretty good spell choices)
[2024-09-04 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: Its a decent upgrade in power that feels like it fits well with the lore
[2024-09-04 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: I like all the little bones you are tossing me 😄
[2024-09-04 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: (more languages, dropping concentration on detect magic)
[2024-09-04 05:28 PM] rsulfuratus: also you can swap your Elmerca cantrip on long rest
[2024-09-04 08:42 PM] rsulfuratus: how did you do the competency thing in D&D beyond for your game? since you can't homebrew languages I want to have a way to make it easy to know how many languages you should add to your sheet
[2024-09-04 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: No good way to do i in D&D Beyond that I found
[2024-09-04 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: I ended up switching to Dicecloud
