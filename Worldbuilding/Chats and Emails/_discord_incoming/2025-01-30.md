# Discord DM – 2025-01-30

[2025-01-30 06:37 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm nearly done with cosmology - just have two pages left to do and then some headers and organization - i'm not sure if i'll have energy or inclination to do any other worldbuilding tonight but in case i do did you start anything on the west coast history stuff?
[2025-01-30 06:37 PM] Deciusmus: No, I was busy all day at work and then tonight is Zachary’s winter concert
[2025-01-30 06:38 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a few minor cleanups that were pending
[2025-01-30 06:38 PM] Deciusmus: But probably won’t do anything else tonight although maybe a bit when I get home
[2025-01-30 08:05 PM] rsulfuratus: secondary location has all sorts of nice uses:

[2025-01-30 08:44 PM] rsulfuratus: if you feel like naming things these are the backlinks to pages in Cosmology that need names:

[2025-01-30 09:02 PM] rsulfuratus: cosmology is done. pushed the last update. pretty happy with how it turned out. might do a little more reorganizing of staging files and filling in a few details at some point. 
    
    also happy for any feedback if you have suggestions anywhere. didn't tag anything as check/mike particularly but:
    
    - pandemonium
    - the entire planar concepts directory
    - spiritual realms, divine realms, and energy realms landing pages
    - heart of the mountain
    
    are probably most relevant to look over
[2025-01-30 09:04 PM] Deciusmus: did you fix all the names?
[2025-01-30 09:04 PM] Deciusmus: I guess you did
[2025-01-30 09:04 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-01-30 09:05 PM] rsulfuratus: but probably worth skimming the cosmology landing page and seeing if anything jumps out as a weak name in the "Staging" section
[2025-01-30 09:05 PM] rsulfuratus: didn't spend a ton of time on them
[2025-01-30 09:06 PM] Deciusmus: its a really nice organization
[2025-01-30 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: i made the same landing page for background. it is pretty easy to copy over. haven't found a way to use variables in dataview queries but it only takes a minute to manually update
[2025-01-30 09:06 PM] Deciusmus: I think there are a lot of advantages of the in world writing style as it makes it easier to defer difficult "what is true" decisions and still make things feel "done"
[2025-01-30 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: it definitely takes a lot more time. but glad it came out well
[2025-01-30 09:28 PM] Deciusmus: I like the pandemonium page
[2025-01-30 09:38 PM] Deciusmus: just fixing a few typos and stuff; one thought... is it worth getting rid of settled open questions?
    for example I think you've pretty much settled the whole idea of "what are the incorporeal gods divine realms" by making them inaccessible to adventures/PCs and thus unimportant to decide
[2025-01-30 09:39 PM] Deciusmus: with the caveat that in theory, that might only be true for Mos Numena but we don't have to decide given no other substantial religions exist whos secrets would be known by anyone
[2025-01-30 09:39 PM] Deciusmus: is the dicssion in open questions worth keeping?
[2025-01-30 09:58 PM] rsulfuratus: probably yes - i didn't really have the energy to go through and delete what feels settled but i think it is ifne to do. anything that feels like useful brainstorming can be copied to the discussions/brainstorming instead of deleted outright, but we always have it in the git history if needed
