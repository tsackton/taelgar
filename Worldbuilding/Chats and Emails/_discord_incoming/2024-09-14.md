    Uzdan's Blessing of Leadership. When you finish a `[rule]`Long Rest`[/rule]`, you can inspire bravery in yourself and your allies. Choose a number of creatures up to your Proficiency Bonus. Each target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Proficiency Bonus. While a character has these Temporary Hit Points, they are immune to the `[condition]`Frightened`[/condition]`.
[2024-09-14 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: This is supposed to be about 1/2 a origin feat?
[2024-09-14 12:25 PM] Deciusmus: Inspiring Leader feat is character level not prof bonus temp HP... I think this is balanced on its own, in a way, but it seems unfortunate it doesn't synergize with inspiring leader feat. It feels like a character who wants this kind of thing might want to take both, but they kinda clash
[2024-09-14 01:04 PM] rsulfuratus: about to go out for a bit, but yeah, it is tough to get something satisfying because temp hp effects all clash with each other. 
    
    and it is hard to think of other good effects that have the flavor of "inspiring allies" and aren't too complicated
    
    the other option I thought about was just a "fear resistance aura" - you have advantage on saves against being Frightened, as do all allies within 30 feet of you or something. not tied to rest, just always-on
