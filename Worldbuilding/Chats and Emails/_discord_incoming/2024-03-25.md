# Discord DM – 2024-03-25

[2024-03-25 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: I was doing a little tag cleanup in between meetings... there is a set of pages that I'm not sure the right status... 
    
    For example, the Abyss. The page right now is just "The realm of corruption and chaos, home of demons. " But for most purposes, that is actually a complete page. Is it worth making it status/needswork because clearly there is more to it than that? Or is it better to just make it no-status to indicate its done for now?
[2024-03-25 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: Or should we have a new status tag for things that are clearly insufficiently detailed but seem good enough as long as they are only "observed from afar"
[2024-03-25 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: This comes up a lot in places as well...
    
    For example, I made up a town along the Wistel, Gowerbourne, just to have a place to have a distant battle be occuring at...
[2024-03-25 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: The page has no real information, but it is "enough" unless someone decides to go there
