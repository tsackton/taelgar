# Discord DM – 2024-02-02

[2024-02-02 01:37 PM] rsulfuratus: i pushed a religious history of taelgar brainstorming page that tries to centralize some of the strands/ideas about development of human religion on hkar and the impact on extant religious traditions
[2024-02-02 01:52 PM] Deciusmus: I really like that as a general history. It seems to pull together the metaphysical underpinings of a lot of the strains of thought elsewhere and feels like it fits pretty well
[2024-02-02 01:54 PM] Deciusmus: I like the idea that Mos Numena develops by basically the process of re-definition of other gods as archetypes of a "bigger" god, which is a good explanation for how it becomes dominant
[2024-02-02 01:55 PM] Deciusmus: Somewhat unclear is an answer to how demons, devils, celestials, etc came into being
[2024-02-02 01:56 PM] Deciusmus: There is the early idea (i.e. that Thandros expressed when we were hunting the gnolls) that human belief in hell created hell, but the mechanism of how it works in the context of the broad sweep of religious history is a little unclear
[2024-02-02 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: i think on the one hand, this probably doesn't need a strictly canonical answer, there can be lots of ideas floating around in-game
[2024-02-02 02:02 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, I didn't mean to suggest we need a strictly canonical answer
[2024-02-02 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: What  I really like about the doc you wrote is it provides a pretty solid working history which can be refered to make new things "fit" without being precisely prespective
[2024-02-02 02:03 PM] rsulfuratus: however, i was trying to also set up the thread of the outer planes with the idea that, until the development of early pantheonic religions, there is no conception of gods having a home in the spiritual realms
[2024-02-02 02:03 PM] rsulfuratus: they are manifestations of divine energy and conduits of divine energy that exist on the material plane
[2024-02-02 02:03 PM] rsulfuratus: but, that doesn't mean that no spiritual realms exist in this era
[2024-02-02 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: But in that context, I was noting that it doesn't help much with the worldbuilding challenge of "what's the background of this demon"
[2024-02-02 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: Right. That makes sense, although I'm not sure I got it from the page
[2024-02-02 02:05 PM] rsulfuratus: i think this could be fleshed out more but one challenge is that i'm not sure what outer planes should exist in taelgar
[2024-02-02 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: canonically we have nine hells, abyss, pandemonium, arborea, and an unnamed prison dimension from the philosopher's guild note about the binding stones
[2024-02-02 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: (in addition to the realms of the gods)
[2024-02-02 02:07 PM] rsulfuratus: but there could and probably will be more
[2024-02-02 02:08 PM] Deciusmus: This is where I feel like metaphysics helps. I feel like the fairly well-established metaphysics of the human religions helps clarify, for example, what the "right answer" is to an in-game question about what's going on at abandoned kestavo shrine that appears to be haunted.
[2024-02-02 02:09 PM] Deciusmus: There doesn't need to be a deep and firm set of rules, but the skeleton makes it a lot easier to make up a consistent answer.
[2024-02-02 02:09 PM] Deciusmus: I feel like that is kinda missing from the outer realms
[2024-02-02 02:09 PM] Deciusmus: Not saying it has to be created now or anything, but its a gap in the Taelgar-ian metaphysics
[2024-02-02 02:11 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, agreed. i kind of feel like it needs a bit more in-game exposure before it can be consolidated into metaphysics, though. 2025 is likely to involve a huge amount of extraplanar exploration in game so an answer might become clearer in 18 months
[2024-02-02 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: I was about to say something similar, but with the added point that I'm pretty confident our game will get to outer plane stuff somewhat / long before my game does
[2024-02-02 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: I expect to eventually be doing a fair bit with the Far Realms and weird abberations and stuff, but we are averaging ~10 sessions/year (6-7 hour in person sessions, so about twice the length of a DuFr session) so its probably more like late 2025/2026 (when we get to the last arc of my game)
[2024-02-02 02:15 PM] rsulfuratus: the far realms feels easier in a way since they are explicitly weird and alien and in some ways it is probably better if there isn't obvious rules or metaphysics that one can derive
[2024-02-02 02:15 PM] Deciusmus: That is also true
[2024-02-02 02:15 PM] Deciusmus: Although just because the danger is on the far realm doesn't mean that the solution isn't somewhere else
[2024-02-02 02:16 PM] rsulfuratus: true. 
    
    separately though, i do think one more obvious question that is raised by the history i've sketched out and might be easier to answer now is what happens to the souls of Deno'qai, Zimka, etc. since the small gods don't inhabit spiritual realms, where do they go?
[2024-02-02 02:17 PM] rsulfuratus: probably this is the same answer as where do the souls of people who died before the development of pantheonic religions go
[2024-02-02 02:17 PM] rsulfuratus: one obvious option is reincarnation, but i'm not sure that is correct
[2024-02-02 02:17 PM] Deciusmus: I actually liked your answer of "beyond the veil"
[2024-02-02 02:17 PM] Deciusmus: Is there a need for a canonical answer?
[2024-02-02 02:18 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess probably not
[2024-02-02 02:18 PM] Deciusmus: I guess there are some implications, i.e. to Speak with Dead, Ressurection
[2024-02-02 02:18 PM] Deciusmus: if the soul is reincarnated, do those even work?
[2024-02-02 02:18 PM] rsulfuratus: not so much speak with dead which doesn't summon the soul back to the body
[2024-02-02 02:18 PM] rsulfuratus: but yes ressurcetion would be impacted
[2024-02-02 02:18 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I guess speak with dead just animates the body to speak its experiences
[2024-02-02 02:19 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is best if there isn't one specific answer
[2024-02-02 02:20 PM] Deciusmus: I definitely don't think the Zimka believe in reincarnation, and I think in general in Taelgar most religious beliefs should align at least somewhat with metaphysical truths. But it seems useful to have enough flexibility in the metaphysics that a culture where reincarnation is true could exist (although it would probably have to be a small gods culture)
[2024-02-02 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: Perhaps the soul manifests where it goes
[2024-02-02 02:22 PM] rsulfuratus: i would actually argue the opposite. a religion where souls are reincarnated would likely be a pantheonic religion where, rather than creating souls out of whatever to give people life, the gods send back souls in their domain
[2024-02-02 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: ^ yeah, fair point. That could certainly work as well
[2024-02-02 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: But I was thinking of an ancestory worshipping, small gods religion where each soul is carried from the land of the dead to a new birth
[2024-02-02 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: directly
[2024-02-02 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the "default" metaphysics is that it is a one way journey, where souls are created out of ~divinity~ somehow (left completely mysterious) and then return to ~divinity~ in some way after passing through the land of the dead, but there is a lot of flexibilty for belief and for deities to reshape this
[2024-02-02 02:24 PM] Deciusmus: How does this relate to the Plane of Souls/Plane of Consicousness?
[2024-02-02 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: not entirely clear, although plane of souls is some kind of manifestation of living souls only
[2024-02-02 02:25 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-02-02 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: it is basically the psionic equivalent of the plane of magic in some sense
[2024-02-02 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: but fully on the "material plane" side of the land of the dead
[2024-02-02 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-02-02 02:28 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the distinction between primal realms and divine realms in my notes is kind of obselete. the basic idea is that the spiritual realms are divided into the proximate realms (dreamworld, plane of souls, astral plane, whatever else) and the outer planes, and those are divided by the land of the dead
[2024-02-02 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: i haven't quite worked out the metaphysics of like astral projection and such, and whether you can actually reach the outer planes from the astral plane, etc
[2024-02-02 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: where does primal magic come from?
[2024-02-02 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: and in some sense the plane of souls, astral plane, and the dreamworld might all be kind of part of the same metaphysical thing
[2024-02-02 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: the material plane
[2024-02-02 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: right, ok
[2024-02-02 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: makes sense
[2024-02-02 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: primal magic is the echoes of the riving
[2024-02-02 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: there is probably also a connection with fey magic to an extent, since metaphysically the echo realms (shadowfell, feywild, mirror realm so far) are effectively part of the material plane
[2024-02-02 02:32 PM] rsulfuratus: at some point someone will play a druid and i'll flesh some of this out in more detail
[2024-02-02 02:33 PM] rsulfuratus: although actually so far everyone who has played a druid has just basically played a nature cleric with their magic as flavored as coming from gods, no one has actually played a metaphyiscally primal magic user
[2024-02-02 02:33 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe i need to introduce a druid npc for a bit
[2024-02-02 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I was going to say one of my players in the Ausson's Crossing miniseries played a dwarven druid, but he decided his magic came from the Baharazel
[2024-02-02 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: Where did Kyr's magic come from? Wasn't he "druidish"
[2024-02-02 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: You need a human druid
[2024-02-02 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: Alternatively, why does the (somewhat odd) D&D rule of primal magic actually have to exist in Taelgar? It isn't crazy to think that all magic is either divine or arcane, and a druid player basically chooses whether they are ultimately channeling the plane of magic or divine magi
[2024-02-02 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, maybe. kyr's magic eventually ended up coming from the plane of consciousness in some sense, although metaphysics have shifted a bit since then
