[2025-02-01 10:21 AM] Deciusmus: Have you thought at all about how many stoneborn there are and where they might live?
[2025-02-01 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus: not in depth. there are a lot living in the southern sentinels, and a decent number in apporia
[2025-02-01 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus: but otherwise have not given it much thought. no one (besides nathaniel and zachary in aborted / non-canon games) has played a stoneborn as more than a guest character
[2025-02-01 10:23 AM] Deciusmus: I was going through region main pages trying to at least fill in notes on civilizations in each region
[2025-02-01 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: kate's guest character in the delwath solo was from a stoneborn community in the northern sentinels near the northern denoqai but whether that was a big community or just a few stoneborn living with deno'qai is unclear
[2025-02-01 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: the lore of stoneborn has always been that they can live in places others can't because ~magic~
[2025-02-01 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: e.g. they can grow food in high mountains and don't feel the cold, etc
[2025-02-01 10:24 AM] Deciusmus: Right.
[2025-02-01 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus: at one point i invented a desert stoneborn variant (sandborn), in part for one of the early players in the great library campaign who dropped out about half way through
[2025-02-01 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus: but it was never developed and isn't canonical
[2025-02-01 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus: (but could be)
[2025-02-01 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus: oh, there were a lot of stoneborn living in the svarnjo mountains too
[2025-02-01 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus: i don't want to make too many constraining decisions about stoneborn though because at some point someone will want to play one for a long campaign and it would be nice to leave space for player input
[2025-02-01 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus: i don't think the region pages need to be considered complete - i think it is better to just catalog what has been invented and not feel obligated to make up a bunch of stuff just to fill gaps
[2025-02-01 10:29 AM] Deciusmus: I agree but also I think it is good to know where the gaps are
[2025-02-01 10:30 AM] Deciusmus: That is, say, there is clearly not a major stoneborn community in say the mostreve hills
[2025-02-01 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-02-01 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2025-02-01 10:31 AM] Deciusmus: And to some extent it is better to decide something like… hrm there are too few stoneborn communities in the “core” known world and add one (even if poorly defined) then to have a bunch of other invention proceed without the stoneborn somewhere and then get kinda stuck with trying to decide why the stoneborn somewhere didn’t have any influence on history or culture
[2025-02-01 10:32 AM] Deciusmus: (For stoneborn specifically I don’t think it matters actually as they are kinda canonically on the edges of events)
[2025-02-01 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus: right i was going to say i actually like stoneborn as not have a big impact on world events
[2025-02-01 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus: but yeah i agree with the general idea
[2025-02-01 10:33 AM] Deciusmus: But lizardfolk and dwarves actually seem somewhat lightly represented across the known world as well.
[2025-02-01 10:34 AM] Deciusmus: Although perhaps lizardfolk should be thought of more like halflings and not usually or only found in “lizardfolk realms”
[2025-02-01 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus: going through the hobgoblin movements does make it seem like it would be worth going through the non-humans and thinking a bit about where they canonically exist and have influence, where the open spaces are, and whether any of them should be "reserved"
[2025-02-01 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus: dwarves feel pretty complete, actually:
    - huge significant kingdoms across the sentinels
    - additional important and influential kingdom in yuvanti
    - chardon has a significant dwarven population
    - apporia did have lots of dwarves but they were mostly killed in the [[war of the dark rift]], and the ones that survived are, in part, now scattered across the core of the chardonian empire
    - additional dwarves in the svarnjo mountains mostly living in the giant kingdoms
[2025-02-01 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus: - plus the destroyed dwarven kingdom west of amani that can have had significant cultural impact in the north but is now part of the destroyed legacy of the pre-great-war kingdoms
[2025-02-01 10:39 AM] Deciusmus: where do the chardon dwarves come from?
[2025-02-01 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus: apporia, ardith, amani mostly
[2025-02-01 10:40 AM] Deciusmus: right, so basically relatively recent immigrates coming from "destroyed" places
[2025-02-01 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus: right, although that doesn't have to be all there is, that is the vibe i invented for ulfgar frostbeard
[2025-02-01 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus: canonically mawar has very few dwarves and the mawakel border mountains never hosted a significant dwarven population, but other than that they are basically everywhere
[2025-02-01 10:41 AM] Deciusmus: I've been running sembara as the kind of place where dwarves have been slowly drifting into human communities from the sentinel kingdoms for 500ish years or perhaps more, long enough that some places have long established dwarven enclaves, but where also the numbers are always quite small comparatively, and generally with the feel of "expats" rather than natives
[2025-02-01 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: (quite small comparatively means not necessarily absolutely small numbers, but the dwarves are always outnumbered by halflings and humans)
[2025-02-01 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus: right, i think that is correct and the vibe of dwarves is that, while they didn't suffer as much as the elves in the great war + aftermath, the biggest, most powerful dwarven kingdom was obliterated by a huge disaster
[2025-02-01 10:44 AM] Deciusmus: Is Cymea relatively less dwarven?
[2025-02-01 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus: cymea is undecided
[2025-02-01 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus: actually possible it is relatively more dwarven
[2025-02-01 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus: e.g. longstanding dwarven connections and far enough away from the diaster of the sentinels to be less impacted
[2025-02-01 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus: also for example the sembaran highlands might be much more dwarven than the lowlands
[2025-02-01 10:45 AM] Deciusmus: I guess there this question of whether the vibe should 
    - oh there is a substantial mountain range, there are probably dwarves there but maybe not
    or
    - most dwarves live in the sentinels or kingdoms that spun off from the sentinels
[2025-02-01 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: The highland kingdoms in particular are quite dwarven, in my view.
[2025-02-01 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: I think the zimka in general have always had a close relationship with the sentinel dwarven kingdoms
[2025-02-01 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: i think for dwarves the history is not exactly clear.
    
    the gnomes left early on when the - at that time - primarily sentinel-based major dwarven empires started a big underdark campaign against far realm evils
    
    the downfall doesn't destroy the sentinels in the way it dries up the lizardfolk swamps and destroys the elven empires
    
    so maybe after the downfall there is a big expansion of dwarven realms, so you get some pretty far flung kingdoms. but i'm not sure it is decided and i'm not sure it needs to be?
[2025-02-01 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: Right, the question isn't "are there far flung dwarves"
[2025-02-01 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: its just, "is it unusual that there are not dwarves in the mostreve hills"
[2025-02-01 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: ah i see
[2025-02-01 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: hmm
[2025-02-01 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus: probably a little unusual?
[2025-02-01 10:50 AM] Deciusmus: I dunno? I guess my view is that from the perspective of Sembara, the sentinels are where the "big underground" dwarven realms are, and everything else is pretty much "living with humans"
[2025-02-01 10:50 AM] Deciusmus: but I don't know if that has to be right
[2025-02-01 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus: there is actually what might be a piece of a dwarven long road deep beneath a cave in addermarch
[2025-02-01 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus: potentially pre-Downfall and not explored since then
[2025-02-01 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus: so maybe there were dwarves in the mostreve hills a long time ago
[2025-02-01 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus: in general though i feel like dwarves are pretty well though out (as are halflings and elves for the most part, although elves could probably use a second canonical refuge so you have more options for where an elf comes from then orenlas or the ruins of ainumarya)
[2025-02-01 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus: lizardfolk imo likely need the most thought to make sure they are appopriately represented
[2025-02-01 10:54 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah that’s fair
[2025-02-01 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus: as stoneborn canonically are at the edges of things anyway
[2025-02-01 10:54 AM] Deciusmus: Elves don’t have a great place on the map for a second refugee
[2025-02-01 10:55 AM] Deciusmus: Unless it’s in the elder wood somewhere
[2025-02-01 10:55 AM] Deciusmus: Or somewhere pretty marginal
[2025-02-01 10:55 AM] Deciusmus: Or far east/south
[2025-02-01 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus: i don't think the elderwood works really well given the adventure there
[2025-02-01 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus: tawir forest could work
[2025-02-01 10:55 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah I agree
[2025-02-01 10:56 AM] Deciusmus: Tawir Forest could but it changes the hobgoblin narrative a bit - are the elves helping? Staying isolated?
[2025-02-01 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus: i was actually imagining it as a new elven realm, basically settled in the 1620s or something (would need to check the generation timing) by survivors of the conclave war who didn't flee to the feywild / turn their backs on humans / etc
[2025-02-01 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus: (i mean i think dreamhaven is also canonically something of an elven refuge)
[2025-02-01 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus: apporia also works but generally only for isolationist elves
[2025-02-01 10:58 AM] Deciusmus: Right. That commits to a certain “what happened to the survivors of Ainumayria” at least in part but that might be ok
[2025-02-01 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus: hmm. yeah. maybe better to leave the survivors of ainumayria open-ended
[2025-02-01 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus: maybe actually elves are fine
[2025-02-01 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: I was thinking something in apporia could work - maybe the southern/illoria coast
[2025-02-01 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: Doesn’t have to be isolationist, they could be a longstanding group of elves with a bit of a sailing vibe.
[2025-02-01 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus: right, if far enough south they could have just been outside the sphere of the major canonical events
[2025-02-01 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus: that is an intentional blank spot anyway so don't think it is worth putting anything there right way but can keep in mind
[2025-02-01 11:24 AM] Deciusmus: here is my map for dwarves and elves
    
    
    blue - elves (X = destroyed) (but the second elven kingdom is just an idea)
    pink - dwarves (X = destroyed, arrows = significant movement, dotted areas are places where it might actually matter for worldbuilding whether there are significant dwarven realms)

![[../_discord_assets/image-92BF4.png]]
[2025-02-01 11:27 AM] Deciusmus: I put the elves down in apporia because the more I think about it, the more it feels like there really should be another elven place that isn't orenlas, the vibe of orenlas was never really "the last elven home"
[2025-02-01 11:29 AM] Deciusmus: and I think it is better to have something in the nevos sea than to commit to survivors of ainumayra in tawir; I like the basic vibe of Ainumayra being "even the other elves don't really know what happened, this was a big disaster, most of the elves died, sure there were some refugees and whatnot that escaped, but ultimately most of the elves were not active participants in taelgar events after the conclave war"
[2025-02-01 01:39 PM] rsulfuratus: i know you're at the show now, but i think my perspective is - sure this is interesting brainstorming but i am very reluctant to commit to anything at the moment. 
    
    right now the currently running games are all focused on southern sembara and environs, or high level adventures in other planes
    
    apporia, vostok, and cymea are are interesting areas that are ripe for adventures. i don't want to overcommit to worldbuliding in advance of running a game. 
    
    my feeling is i'm far enough behind on updating the vault to reflect (a) things that are canonical in game but haven't been clearly recorded, and (b) fleshing out details and making consistent/organizing of things that exist in broad strokes, that delving into quite tangential questions like "where else might elves live" is a bit distracting
[2025-02-01 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: i think there are advantages of fleshing out details of history where the broad stroke are canonical, because it makes it easier to avoid accidently introducing continuity errors and it makes game prep faster
[2025-02-01 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: but i like the perspective of focusing on cataloging blank spots, not filling them
[2025-02-01 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: apporia and illoria is supposed to be a blank spot, so there shouldn't be an elven population there unless it becomes useful for a game
[2025-02-01 01:42 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway, that's my overall feeling at the moment
[2025-02-01 06:25 PM] Deciusmus: that's fair
