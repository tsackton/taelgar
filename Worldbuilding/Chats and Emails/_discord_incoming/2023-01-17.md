# Discord DM – 2023-01-17

[2023-01-17 12:12 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed some work on whereabouts and items
[2023-01-17 12:12 PM] Deciusmus: Probably won't have time to do more until the weekend; but feel free to pass along feedback
[2023-01-17 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: whereabouts is pretty awesome, just had time for a tiny bit of testing
[2023-01-17 03:29 PM] rsulfuratus: will probably mess around with my github filters tonight before regenerating tons of headers
[2023-01-17 03:29 PM] Deciusmus: The main missing bit on whereabouts is the python equivalent
[2023-01-17 03:30 PM] Deciusmus: Also do like the double ident? (Ie the quote in the note)
[2023-01-17 03:30 PM] rsulfuratus: I will work on that this weekend when I write session notes from last night, as I'll want to push a new website then
[2023-01-17 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: I think I like the double indent, yes
[2023-01-17 03:32 PM] rsulfuratus: one small change - when reprocessing old metadata, I would probably set excursion = true for anything in location/locationRegion
[2023-01-17 03:33 PM] Deciusmus: That makes sense
[2023-01-17 03:33 PM] Deciusmus: And is easy enough
[2023-01-17 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed the location thing
[2023-01-17 07:50 PM] rsulfuratus: almost positive I have the github filter working for secret whereabouts. learned a lot about the limits of non-greedy regexes in the process
