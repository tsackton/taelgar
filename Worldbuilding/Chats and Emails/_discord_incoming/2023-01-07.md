# Discord DM – 2023-01-07

[2023-01-07 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus: pushed some npc templates. if you have the templater plugin installed, you can add the yaml frontmatter template to an NPC and then autogenerate the following summary, if all fields are filled in, with the NPC-header template

[2023-01-07 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus: has a ton of probably ugly javascript to make it relatively clean even if info is not filled in in the metadata.
[2023-01-07 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus: will not auto-update, so if you update metadata have to reinsert template, but with hotkeys that is pretty simple
[2023-01-07 11:34 AM] Deciusmus: i haven't played around with templates is there a 2 sentence "how to"
[2023-01-07 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus: you should be able to just pull my templates from the repo. so you just need install the templater plugin, and then you'll get a button on the sidebar to insert templater templates - just adds the text in the template at your cursor location
[2023-01-07 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus: you can make hotkeys to insert a particular templater template in settings
[2023-01-07 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus: the yaml frontmatter template has to go at the top of the file, of course, and the npc-header template is designed to immediately follow, but reads the yaml frontmatter to construct text, so you need to fill in the yaml metadata first
[2023-01-07 11:38 AM] Deciusmus: i see
[2023-01-07 11:43 AM] Deciusmus: The current year is wrong for me of course 🙂
[2023-01-07 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus: right but that is easy to change
[2023-01-07 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus: but will need a way to keep that from being constantly reverted back and forth in the repo...
[2023-01-07 11:44 AM] Deciusmus: if you install the fantasy calendar plugin, we can use its API to get the current date
[2023-01-07 11:44 AM] Deciusmus: then the ages will update as you move "today" in the calendar
[2023-01-07 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus: ah that is perfect
[2023-01-07 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus: so we can both define today locally
[2023-01-07 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus: great
[2023-01-07 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus: how do you import a fantasy calendar calendar to obsidian? do you have a tl;dr? I just installed the plugin
[2023-01-07 11:46 AM] Deciusmus: I just created one
[2023-01-07 11:46 AM] Deciusmus: I didn’t use the website
[2023-01-07 11:47 AM] Deciusmus: There is a settings wheel once you import it where you can just define a calendar
[2023-01-07 11:47 AM] Deciusmus: Ie set the months, weeks, intercalendary days, leap years, moon phases, etc
[2023-01-07 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus: right. i spent a while calibrating the moon in taelgar
[2023-01-07 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus: but I should be able to copy the settings
[2023-01-07 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus: cycle 29.5 shift -15
[2023-01-07 11:49 AM] Deciusmus: I should probably use the same moon settings as you
[2023-01-07 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah. the moon can't change since all the dates of werewolf events and festivals depend on it
[2023-01-07 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus: what do you think of "starday, sunday, moonsday, lightsday, waterday, godsday, freeday" for days of the week? close enough to sat/sun/mon/tues/wed/thurs/fri for understandability
[2023-01-07 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus: i'm going to use those for now but easy enough to change. more difficult is the months, although may change those too at some point
[2023-01-07 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus: also taelgar has no leap days. someday if we revise the months might add some intercalary days but they would be fixed every year.
[2023-01-07 12:18 PM] Deciusmus: It’s really easy to get the template working with current year
[2023-01-07 12:18 PM] Deciusmus: Plus the last updated can be an i game year
[2023-01-07 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus: was just looking at that, tl;dr?
[2023-01-07 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus: assume it is just putting a fantasy calendar api call in the templater code
[2023-01-07 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus: here is a separate weird issue, maybe you have a thought. whenever I pull your changes, either secrets filter or something else is making it so that all the files are just pulled also have untracked changes in my index. but i haven't touched them
[2023-01-07 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus: looking at diffs, it seems to be something about newlines.
[2023-01-07 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus: ah I think I know
[2023-01-07 12:34 PM] Deciusmus: I’m out with Z but I can send you the JavaScript in an hour or so
[2023-01-07 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2023-01-07 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: can you send the JavaScript for fantasy calendar api? or just push your edits?
[2023-01-07 04:11 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah one sec
[2023-01-07 04:27 PM] Deciusmus: Pushed
[2023-01-07 05:14 PM] rsulfuratus: npc callout box, yes or no?
[2023-01-07 05:14 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-93CB8.png]]
[2023-01-07 05:15 PM] rsulfuratus: or blockquote?
[2023-01-07 05:15 PM] rsulfuratus:

[2023-01-07 05:15 PM] rsulfuratus: two markdown lines?
[2023-01-07 05:15 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-CBB4D.png]]
[2023-01-07 05:16 PM] rsulfuratus: one line?
[2023-01-07 05:16 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-B6BE1.png]]
[2023-01-07 05:31 PM] rsulfuratus: also any other metadata fields it would be nice to have to NPCs/People? i am going to update a bunch tonight/tomorrow so want to kind of finalize this setup. 
    
    I have affiliations, but that is more for making org lists with dataview in organization pages, and it isn't really universal.
[2023-01-07 05:33 PM] rsulfuratus: the location stuff could perhaps be hierarchical, e.g. 
    location->`region, location->`settlement
[2023-01-07 05:35 PM] rsulfuratus: I think things like appearance, personality, role playing quirks, motivations/goals are better not automated
[2023-01-07 05:35 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway if you have ideas for format or other information let me know. once I do 100 NPCs information won't really want to change things
[2023-01-07 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: I like the callout
[2023-01-07 06:00 PM] Deciusmus: For rulers I thought having a regnal years would be good and perhaps children
[2023-01-07 06:00 PM] Deciusmus: But I’d do that as a separate template
[2023-01-07 06:01 PM] Deciusmus: I’m not sure there is much point in gender you could just have pronouns
[2023-01-07 06:14 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah things like rulers and gods can get their own specific template
[2023-01-07 06:15 PM] rsulfuratus: agree can probably dump gender. i have it set up to autogenerate pronouns from gender unless there is pronouns set, so e.g. you could have someone female (she/they)
[2023-01-07 06:15 PM] rsulfuratus: but no point in printing gender in header, i agree.
[2023-01-07 06:17 PM] rsulfuratus: I turned off your code to auto-generate links to locations, because for example there are some NPCs whose current location is "somewhere in Dunmar" or "east of Karawa in the blasted plains" and it is kind of annoying to have those generic locations get auto-tagged
[2023-01-07 06:18 PM] rsulfuratus: which is why I was thinking of adding more granularity to location, but not sure it is worth the effort. would mostly be for dataview autotables
