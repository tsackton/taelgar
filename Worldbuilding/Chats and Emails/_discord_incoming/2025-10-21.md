# Discord DM – 2025-10-21

[2025-10-21 07:09 AM] Deciusmus: I dunno if I will have time for it this week but the other thing I would like to do is try to finish making up sembaran holidays.
[2025-10-21 07:09 AM] Deciusmus: It would be really useful to have a holiday calendar for narrative purposes during downtime.
[2025-10-21 11:16 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah agreed
[2025-10-21 02:03 PM] Deciusmus: It would probably make sense to have something like 10-15 feast days in a normal village. We already have 3 “broad” mos Numena holidays in winter..
    
    Plus there is probably at least one celebrating the survival of drankor after the downfall, and perhaps a “birthday of humanity” type holiday
[2025-10-21 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: Then maybe 1-2 other common holidays and the rest are a mix of sembaran and local
[2025-10-21 02:05 PM] rsulfuratus: right. the downfall wars / escape from hkar is established as a holiday in drankor but was a major focus of apollyon's supression efforts so remains open question as to how much it is still celebrated and how. minimally it can't have its original drankorian flavor of celebrating the escape from hkar on a moving island
[2025-10-21 02:05 PM] rsulfuratus: but generically turning into 'thanksgiving' could work
[2025-10-21 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I think it’s a good opportunity for a actual earth style holiday that is celebrating a mythic and completely wrong event
[2025-10-21 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah or that works too
[2025-10-21 02:07 PM] Deciusmus: I kinda like the idea of there being all kinds of totally wrong stories about the downfall. It’s celebrated kinda like Noah’s arc or whatever without reference to real history
[2025-10-21 02:07 PM] Deciusmus: But not wedded to that
[2025-10-21 02:07 PM] Deciusmus: It could even have been successfully suppressed and all that survived is a generic “thanks for the miracle of humans existing”
[2025-10-21 02:08 PM] rsulfuratus: i think that the vibe of mos numena suggests that a specific feast of thanksgiving would be plausible independent of the downfall wars whatever
[2025-10-21 02:08 PM] rsulfuratus: focused on acknowleding the small personal miracles or whatever
[2025-10-21 02:09 PM] Deciusmus: Right that could also work well
[2025-10-21 02:09 PM] rsulfuratus: then you could have a holiday that is basically thanks for the new place to live when paradise was destroyed type thing
[2025-10-21 02:10 PM] rsulfuratus: so the founding myth of mos numena is something like humanity lived happily in paradise, the evil things attacked, and we were saved by divine grace. although maybe that is too close to the truth
[2025-10-21 02:11 PM] Deciusmus: I wonder if the downfall and subsequent survival on the moving island is what created the idea that you give thanks for miracles
[2025-10-21 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: So proto-mos Numena on Hkar is focused on 
    
    - a ritual calendar with holidays tied to cycles of magic and the specific gods
    - a smaller, more ancient personal holiday celebrating the individual miracle granted to each human of birth and death
[2025-10-21 02:12 PM] Deciusmus: But the idea of public celebrations of public miracles isn’t really a think
[2025-10-21 02:12 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i like that actually
[2025-10-21 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: The drankorians however create it as a way to celebrate the specific miracle of their rescue from Hkar and it starts to become a new way of worship - public praise of the gods for public miracles
[2025-10-21 02:15 PM] Deciusmus: Without trying to make up all the details by modern day you have three types of holiday:
    - the ancient personal holiday of thanksgiving for the miracles of birth and death, still similar in some ways to the ancient Hkar one
    - some ritual holidays focused on specific gods, always Drankorian in origin and in some cases tracing back to Hkar although much changed 
    - public praise of the gods for specific miracles, which in form trace back to the downfall miracle but which in practice don’t tend to be widely shared
[2025-10-21 02:17 PM] Deciusmus: And then maybe it does work for the downfall miracle to have been surpressed - it survives in form but there is no longer a memory of the actual miracle of the survival from the downfall
[2025-10-21 02:18 PM] Deciusmus: Or alternatively there is it is just wrong. Not sure which is better
[2025-10-21 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the downfall miracle being suppressed probably works better. 
    
    there are likely a variety of myths about the "heroic age" or whatever and myths about the origin of humanity but these are all jumbled and confused and fairly disconnected from truth. especially in sembara with a strong ethnic connection to pre-downfall migrations.
[2025-10-21 02:20 PM] rsulfuratus: plus it gives apollyon a good evil victory in his possessed all three artifacts days
[2025-10-21 02:20 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2025-10-21 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking in semabra there is probably 2-3 broad miracle-remembrance holidays 
    
    - a celebration of Cece and the radiant alliance tied to the Father
    - something ancient dating back to the fall of drankor and the dark age
    - something around the Great War or founding of modern sembara
    
    But I’m not sure if all 3 is a good idea or whether to drop one, or if these are the right three “sembaran” holidays
[2025-10-21 02:24 PM] Deciusmus: But if you have something like:
    
    - the 3 ritual holidays we have
    - 3 more ritual holidays
    - a thanksgiving holiday
    - 3 sembaran holidays
    - 1-3 holidays per town/village/region
    
    you have between 11 and 13 holidays which feels about right
[2025-10-21 02:27 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. i think a total of 6 ritual holidays is good, plus the ancient thanksgiving holiday. that is 7 more or less universal holidays. 
    
    i would then actually just have a bunch of miracle-remembrance holidays of various scales. i think that e.g. Cece and the radiant alliance might be celebrated pretty widely across greater sembara but not in cymean or tollen; the great war might be celebrated everywhere; etc. there is no organized "Sembaran church" so there can't really be Sembaran state holidays
[2025-10-21 02:28 PM] Deciusmus: Right yes. That makes sense
[2025-10-21 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: in Chardon things might be a little more organized given the imperial state influence on the church, but even so there are likely apporian miracle holidays not celebrated in chardon, and vice versa (though some "Imperial" miracle holidays do likely spread a little beyond their natural bounds)
[2025-10-21 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: i think from a game perspective it makes sense to develop ~7 major / universal holidays and then just drop in a variety of miracle-remembrance holidays whereever useful. e.g. you'd focus on the ones celebrated in the cleeanseau region w/o needing to make clear decisions about the reach of each
[2025-10-21 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: (btw, the note "Research about Limbo and the Plaguelands" has some stuff that might be useful to you if you want to do a war of the ashen hoard mini-arc in your game)
[2025-10-21 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: Right. On the # of holidays, I think that is perfect. If we have 4 really good ideas for ritual holidays, I don't think 7 would be bad; and 5 would also be ok if we only have 3 ideas. But basically 5-7 ritual holidays + 1 universal holiday of thanksgiving are core to Mos Numena (and if we ever made up a "hkar derived archetype pantheon" that isn't mos numena, that thanksgiving holiday would be shared.
[2025-10-21 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: Then what about this as an idea?
    
    In Drankor, after the downfall, the spontaneous celebrations of the miracle were given form and function and purpose by a specific office of the state (like the Roman pontifix) that in part selected things to remember and celebrate with an explicit goal and understanding of the mechanics that strengthen the gods. These new "miracle celebration" holidays were empire-wide and selected specifically by the pontifix every decade or whatever.
    
    Apolloyon wasn't just trying to disrupt the memory of Hkar, he was trying to break the whole system, because the drankorians were right, it _really was_ making mos numena gods stronger.
[2025-10-21 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: And he succeeded. He took of the office, even though it wasn't supposed to be the emperor's, etc and set about trying to get rid of the whole idea of worshipping miracles at all.
[2025-10-21 02:41 PM] Deciusmus: He didn't quite succeed at that, but when the dust settled after the fall of Drankor the various successor states found their own ways forward with the idea of miracle remembrance. Perhaps even in slightly different ways in different places.
[2025-10-21 02:43 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah so i think that works on the mundane level, in the sense that apollyon disrupted a lot of stuff through mundane (as in not using strong magic) politics. but also used the crown to just yank the memory of the circular island from everyone's head perhaps as part of his final ritual to become a god (interrupted by cha'mutte).
[2025-10-21 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-10-21 02:43 PM] rsulfuratus: but yeah this is a good vibe for how the miracle remembrance holidays become a kind of local reflection of the various strains of mos numena
[2025-10-21 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: So then you might even imagine that the different strains of Mos Numena are kinda different here...
    
    (a) Sembara and Tollen - inspired by the kestavo tradition - have a very local vibe, where each unit has its own things, and there is no central church, and it is very loose
    (b) Chardon perhaps develops a little differently, and there is more of an idea of "official miracles" blessed by a central authority, and although its still the case that each place might have some different celebrations, there is more of a sense of a "proper" feast day is one where the event remembered has been registered and confirmed by Chardon (ala catholic saints where different villages have different saints but no one just makes one up)
[2025-10-21 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: That could in turn be an interesting source of conflict between Mawar and Chardon, where the Mawaran tradition has a totally different way of looking at this type of remembrance holiday
[2025-10-21 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: Cymea and Isingue and Tyrwinghan don't have clear picture here, not sure how many strains of Mos Numena there should be
[2025-10-21 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: Although I increasingly like the idea that Tyrwinghan is kind of its own thing
[2025-10-21 02:47 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah this is good. i think cymea / isingue don't need to be developed right now
[2025-10-21 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: by default they are sembaran
[2025-10-21 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: but could later be fleshed out in more depth if desired
[2025-10-21 02:49 PM] Deciusmus: I was contemplating the idea that Tyrwingha doesn't even celebrate miracles like Sembara at all, but instead has some form of fey worship or fey festivals that are intertwined with religious concepts, more like the idea of pagan festivals in medieval England becoming somewhat "church-touched
[2025-10-21 02:50 PM] rsulfuratus: for the west, i think that perhaps a key part of the western wars during the Drankorian era was trying to centralize control over religion as a source of imperial power - and also as a way to increase the power of the mos numena gods.
[2025-10-21 02:51 PM] rsulfuratus: this could then cascade down to the post-drankorian era where most of the drankorian-aligned small polities that develop in this area still look to a central authority (perhaps in chardon) to certify miracles in a sense
[2025-10-21 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: but the northern influenced parts of mos numena (predominantly mawar, but also including some undeveloped people on the "great bay" and elsewhere) have a very different vibe in some ways more similar to sembara as it is influenced by the tanshi
[2025-10-21 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: but the tanshi are less place based and more ritual-associated, so this turns into kind of local saints, potentially including historical figures and ancestors (in mawar, influenced by lizardfolk and gatza)
[2025-10-21 02:53 PM] Deciusmus: right i like that
[2025-10-21 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: I'm reading your note on limbo, the ferrystone connection is pretty convienent if I want to do something in my game 🙂
[2025-10-21 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: the pcs are great friends of the ferrystones
[2025-10-21 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i was looking at dwarven clans in obisidan
[2025-10-21 02:55 PM] rsulfuratus: of course he predicted the war of the ashen horde couldn't happen when it did (because of course it was a downstream consequence of rai and the monks failure), so it is less convenient than the reverse in some ways
[2025-10-21 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: although if you wanted to send the pcs to aurbez for the war it could always be something like he is horrified by his failure and the surpise nature of the war when he was certain his theories said this year was safe or something like that
[2025-10-21 02:57 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, I actually dont want to send them all the way to Aurbez, it is more on the outskirts. My idea was some secondary (small) outbreak in southern Maseau (which in part could be a reason no one came to the aid of Aurbez)
[2025-10-21 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: Of course if I introduce a dwarven scholar who was wrong they are going to want to find out _why_ he was wrong
[2025-10-21 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: esp my dwarf lunar sorcerer who is very into these kinds of things
[2025-10-21 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: ha hmm that could be challenging. although actually it could be a good hook for the lunar sorcerer at some point if you want to get them thinking about planar tides and the like. though you probably don't want to drag your party into the whole beryl/rai story
[2025-10-21 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: yeah. I'm not even sure about the ashen horde thing, my other two ideas are a young dragon who fled the plaguelands and is now causing trouble in the mostreve hills, and a fire and/or hill giant causing trouble to the west, out in the marches of enford
[2025-10-21 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: I kinda like the dragon the best, I think it is about time for them to fight a dragon
[2025-10-21 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: right yeah i remember you mentioned that
[2025-10-21 03:04 PM] Deciusmus: Anyway, I need to get back to work, but to summarize holidays:
    
    * we should make up 2-4 more ritual holidays
    * plus a thanksgiving holiday
    
    From there, each region is kinda on its own - for my purposes I kinda want to come up with rough notes on 2-3  "greater sembara"/"sembara" holidays and a few cleenseau-specific ones (probably one regional one, and then 0-2 in each village)
[2025-10-21 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: Before I present anything to my players though I need to decide if Tyrwingha is
    (a) the same as Sembara
[2025-10-21 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: (b) similar but a little different
    (c) very different
[2025-10-21 03:07 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't think tyrwingha should be very different, or at least i think the idea of miracle worship holidays should be universal including in tyrwingha
[2025-10-21 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: whether the practical vibes are similar or different is more up in the air
[2025-10-21 03:09 PM] rsulfuratus: i think any fey-touched "church-themed pagan rituals" would be layered over the baseline set of miracle thanksgivings
[2025-10-21 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: (which could mean there are fewer local miracle holidays, although you do have one tyrwinghan one in obsidian)
[2025-10-21 03:10 PM] Deciusmus: yes, I did make up one for a village one of my pcs came from
[2025-10-21 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: but that village is also designed as a place where there are a lot of sembarans, it could in theory be a sembaran church tradition that has been imported
[2025-10-21 03:13 PM] Deciusmus: There is a mystery at the heart of Tyrwingha that could do with some resolution, which is basically....
    
    Where did the people come from, who did they worship before the Drankorians came, and why the special relationship with the fey?
    
    In practical terms, I've established or hinted:
    * the fey in Tyrwingha in part serve to protect the land, so the Tyrwinghans suffer fewer monsters/etc than say, Sembaran borderlands
    * Ethlenn has some specific ability to open/stabliize portals and a idosyncratic love of mortals
    * Ethlenn does not like other fey messing with her mortals
    * There is a specific job in Tyrwinghan villages to "mind the fey" that is at least somewhat related to the job of "mind the gods"
[2025-10-21 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: Also we've established that Mos Numena replaced _something_ in Tyrwinghan at the explicit request / bargain with Ethlenn
[2025-10-21 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: Tyrwingha in play has also come across as a more communal/rural sort of place than Sembara, more collective ownership, fewer lords, fewer cities, less wealth, a little more insular, with a bit of a sense of self that is distinctly distinct from Sembara
[2025-10-21 03:16 PM] rsulfuratus: i think part of this likely has to do with addermarch, which is also a fey heavy place but where people are much more scared of the fey, with more of a german folktale vibe of the fey generally being bad news
[2025-10-21 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: Right. That in part is explained by Ethlenn though, right? Addermarch is not her realm, and whatever her idiosyncratic reasons for caring about the safety of mortals, she only exherts much effort for _her_ mortals
[2025-10-21 03:17 PM] rsulfuratus: sort of but i think might relate to the general structure of the feywild here. Morlaith - there are some details in the Addermarch Fey Politics note in brainstorming - has a very "Old God" kind of vibe
[2025-10-21 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: I think there is a fey "belt" from the Mostreve Gap through to the Western Gulf, probably bordering Orenlas in the south as well that is just dense with portals and connection to Taelgar
[2025-10-21 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: for either Ethlenn or perhaps just historical happenstance reasons
[2025-10-21 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: and you also have isingue nearby and the heartroot which was created during the riving when the istaros was created which obviously has some connection to the feywild since the sunset gate and the istaros mirror each other
[2025-10-21 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: or some of both
[2025-10-21 03:19 PM] Deciusmus: Right. Maybe the fey belt goes all the way south to the plaguelands/isingue, although in my head I don't tend to think of Isingue as heavily fey-influenced
[2025-10-21 03:19 PM] rsulfuratus: right isingue is probably not, since the heartroot is a material plane entity not a feywild entity
[2025-10-21 03:21 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not totally sure about this but i think there is a possibility that morlaith / ancient "old god" forest entity once ruled a very large swath of the feywild
[2025-10-21 03:22 PM] rsulfuratus: eventually morlaith gets driven back, first by ethlenn and later by the cloudspinner and umbraeth even
[2025-10-21 03:22 PM] rsulfuratus: so tyrwingha then is 'special' in the sense that it was kind of the first fey realm in this area
[2025-10-21 03:23 PM] rsulfuratus: now why ethlenn created Twlight's Gracee here then is left unanswered
[2025-10-21 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: Meaning Tyrwingha is the mirror on Taelgar of Twilight's Grace, which is the first place in the region that is a non-Morlaith place?
[2025-10-21 03:23 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-10-21 03:24 PM] Deciusmus: Right. that all works for the feywild politics, but what about on Taelgar?
[2025-10-21 03:24 PM] rsulfuratus: and there is a possible story about how part of the act of that first creation was about binding taelgar and the feywild closer together, which ties into ethlenn's control of portals
[2025-10-21 03:24 PM] Deciusmus: I'm more stuck on where did the Tyrwinghans (and maybe Addermanians as well) come from?
[2025-10-21 03:25 PM] rsulfuratus: ah. that i don't have a clear answer for but is there a reason it has to be different from the established settlement of humanity in the region?
[2025-10-21 03:26 PM] Deciusmus: I have not necessarily thought of the tyrwinghans as being mariner-derived, although they could be an offshoot of the northerners
[2025-10-21 03:26 PM] rsulfuratus: the other possibliity is just make them like the basques
[2025-10-21 03:26 PM] rsulfuratus: until genetics no one had any idea where the basques came from
[2025-10-21 03:27 PM] Deciusmus: I was wondering if Ethlenn actually brought them via the feywild to Tyrwinghan before the downfall
[2025-10-21 03:27 PM] Deciusmus: from Hkar
[2025-10-21 03:27 PM] Deciusmus: make them a little like the Dunmari
[2025-10-21 03:28 PM] Deciusmus: Or, if Ethlenn bringing them there doesn't feel right, at least a separate migration, a la the dunmari, but with a more mysterious backstory
[2025-10-21 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: right but why do we need to know their exact cultural heritage? that is my point about the basques. i think the simplest answers are either (a) they are part of the established northerner / mariner mixing in the sembaran region, perhaps with mostly northern roots or something, but fitting within the established paradigm, or (b) they are a unique cultural group that is outside that paradigm. 
    
    if (b), i'm not sure the details of how they got there matter as much as the fact they are unique.
[2025-10-21 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: there isn't necessarily a need for there to be a clear reason why they left hkar, if they are just a unique migration. Actually the language fits into that
[2025-10-21 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: right, I was typing the same thing, but I went to look at languags
[2025-10-21 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: Tyrwinghan language is Welsh, which derives from Proto-Celtic, which in turn is a unique branch of Indo-European
[2025-10-21 03:32 PM] Deciusmus: So by compartative linguistics we can determine that the Tyrwinghans are a unique culture that probably left Hkar a little before or after the mariners,
[2025-10-21 03:32 PM] Deciusmus: But also probably on Hkar that they were more closely aligned with the mariners than the Dunmari were
[2025-10-21 03:33 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the way i would phrase it though is more in-world. the tyrwinghans see themselves as always having lived here. i don't think it fits very well with established lore for the tyrwinghans to see themselves like the dunmari, and explicitly outsider group that migrated here, even if they've made it their home now.
[2025-10-21 03:33 PM] Deciusmus: Oh, sure
[2025-10-21 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: I don't think the Tyrwinghans know their history. Since before the downfall they lived in Tyrwinghan and were protected from Ethlenn
[2025-10-21 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: what more is there to say?
[2025-10-21 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: I would perhaps even suggest there are no particular stories or myths about where they came from, or travel, but there are perhaps dim cultural memories of the mariners and northerners showing up in the region
[2025-10-21 03:36 PM] Deciusmus: But I think from a worldbuilding perspective it is useful to establish them as a unique migration from Hkar of unclear timing and purpose
[2025-10-21 03:36 PM] Deciusmus: but after northerners
[2025-10-21 03:36 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the idea that they are a unique cultural group - not mariners or northerners - is good. i think addermarch is ethnically related, perhaps more intermixed with sembarans and drankor. it seems clear from various notes that this is in ind during development of various bits of tyrwinghan lore
[2025-10-21 03:36 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`in mind
[2025-10-21 03:36 PM] Deciusmus: Right, but to go back to your feywild thing... I don't think Addermarch has been settled for 2000 years
[2025-10-21 03:37 PM] Deciusmus: It is much more recent. So ultimately Addermanians came from Tyrwingha or Sembara or Drankor or Isingue. Before the Downfall it was just a scary fey forest and no one went there
[2025-10-21 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i think that addermarch is more of an offshoot of tyrwingha
[2025-10-21 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. "Possibility: original settlers may have included a substantial number of exiles from Tyrwingha, or people who rejected Ethlenn's bargain, which may color the perception of the fey in Addermarch"
[2025-10-21 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: but addermarch definitely predates drankorian expansion to Sembara
[2025-10-21 03:39 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. I think this in the addermarch note is true: "Addermarch was settled long ago, before the [[Drankorian Empire|Drankorians]] came, by a people sharing a cultural and linguistic tradition with [[Tyrwingha]]. During the [[Drankorian Era]], it was a backwater province of the [[Drankorian Empire]], never densely settled, but supported and garrisoned as a ward against the dangers of the [[Darkwood]]. "
[2025-10-21 03:43 PM] Deciusmus: Right although the eariest campaigns in the region were 358 and Ethlenn's treaty was 423 (although I don't know if those dates need to be exactly canonical)
[2025-10-21 03:43 PM] Deciusmus: Do you see Addermarch as settled long before 358, i.e. perhaps even pre-Downfall? When did Morliath's domain shrink enough for it to be safe?
[2025-10-21 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: I liked your idea above that in some ancient world, some "old god" fey ruled a vast feywild domain in an area rich with fey portals, and that made being a human in the area kinda tough going. Not impossible, but not exactly where you'd want to settle if you had a choice
[2025-10-21 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: but Tyrwingha, in that story, is massively massively safer
[2025-10-21 03:45 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure why someone would leave Tyrwingha for the dangerous woods...
[2025-10-21 03:45 PM] rsulfuratus: i think that addermarch would be settled post downfall, pre drankor. maybe something like 250 or even 300. not sure the exact time
[2025-10-21 03:46 PM] rsulfuratus: downfall shakes things up. and of course not all of addermarch is settled at once. the aure river valley is quite productive farmland
[2025-10-21 03:47 PM] rsulfuratus: and the tyrwinghan borders are decent rangeland and also relatively unforested
[2025-10-21 03:47 PM] rsulfuratus: so when i say addermarch is settled that likely means the northeastern parts of modern day addermarch, along the aure and the western slopes of the border hills
[2025-10-21 03:49 PM] rsulfuratus: there is also the complication of pre-downfall elven and lizardfolk kingdoms
[2025-10-21 03:51 PM] rsulfuratus: i think my sense of the big picture vibe - not sure if this is correct - is basically that pre-downfall, it generally fell to the elves and other "elder folk" to warn humans about the fey and keep them safe and negotiate and all that. so it might be that people settling in addermarch pre-downfall aren't settling in scary dark forest, they are settling in the outskirts of elven lands. more edge of mirkwood than old forest.
[2025-10-21 03:51 PM] rsulfuratus: but then after the downfall, things get worse
[2025-10-21 03:51 PM] rsulfuratus: darkness spreads from the darkwood south and east, etc
[2025-10-21 03:52 PM] Deciusmus: right. there are a lot of notes in the "Historical Framework" document
[2025-10-21 03:53 PM] rsulfuratus: i think there are a bunch of possibilities and i'm not sure it is necessary to commit to any for the purpose of developing tyrwinghan religion it might be enough to establish that tyrwingha predates the downfall, was protected by ethlenn from otherwise impersonal/alien/old god/old forest fey entity, and is from a cultural strand that sees itself as distinct from sembara/zimka/tollen and "have lived on this land forever"
[2025-10-21 03:54 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2025-10-21 03:54 PM] Deciusmus: agreed
[2025-10-21 03:55 PM] Deciusmus: Addermarch history is a bit more complicated but not really my goal to develop right now. I think Addermarch ultimately should end up being larger Tyrwinghan/Sembaran/or some blend in flavor rather than its own unique culture
[2025-10-21 03:55 PM] rsulfuratus: i think of it as basically tyrwinghan originally but pulled under the sway of sembara due to lack of ethlenn
[2025-10-21 03:56 PM] rsulfuratus: like "assimilationist wales" or whatever
[2025-10-21 03:58 PM] rsulfuratus: basically ethlenn acts as a strong counterweight to keep tyrwinghan culture isolated / distinct, while addermarch is both more connected by trade to greater sembara (e.g. economy is much more export-oriented with timber and brandy) and has a very different relationship with fey, so it drifts more towards a southern sembaran vibe with some unique elements (e.g. politically it is organized more like tyrwingha)
[2025-10-21 03:58 PM] Deciusmus: right I like that
[2025-10-21 03:58 PM] Deciusmus: but to go back to Tyrwingha, I'm still not sure how this helps flesh out the religion.
    
    This cultural backstory implies that there was some kind of older religion before Drankor, that is _not_ kestavo or a mariner-derived pantheon
[2025-10-21 03:59 PM] Deciusmus: which has always felt true to me... and actually I'm not sure it matters what it was
[2025-10-21 03:59 PM] Deciusmus: if Ethlenn specifically gave it up for Mos Numena
[2025-10-21 03:59 PM] rsulfuratus: right i think it gets swept away in the tides of history. from the in-game perspective, it is like medieval scholarship on stonehenge
[2025-10-21 04:00 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. no one knows
[2025-10-21 04:00 PM] Deciusmus: But I guess the open question for me would be something like...
    
    Would it have been actual worship of the fey? Or does that seem implausible?
[2025-10-21 04:00 PM] Deciusmus: I think the obvious candidates are either some specific worship of the fey, or a never-to-be-made-up unique small gods tradition
[2025-10-21 04:00 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean would fey want to be worshipped? it seems a little off
[2025-10-21 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I think it is a little off too
[2025-10-21 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: The fey don't have gods, do they?
[2025-10-21 04:01 PM] rsulfuratus: no
[2025-10-21 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: although kate played a fey cleric in the seeker one shot so i guess not impossible for them to use divine magic via some other way. but no organized religion or worship or deities in either the embodied god or incorporatel god sens
[2025-10-21 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: I almost wonder if the vibe in ancient Tyrwinghan was something where the fey and the small gods almost collaborated to protect the tyrwinghans, and the tyrwinghans had a cultural tradition of seeing gods and fey as almost co-equal
[2025-10-21 04:03 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean there is no reason why the ancient tyrwinghans couldn't have had some dunmari-style family pantheon religion
[2025-10-21 04:03 PM] Deciusmus: true
[2025-10-21 04:03 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe their gods were weak already, dying out
[2025-10-21 04:04 PM] rsulfuratus: in part because the early tyrwinghans tended to confuse fey and divine magic, and stopped really believing in their gods as divine entities
[2025-10-21 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: For me, I like the vibe of modern-day Tyrwingha having the temple by the locus of fey rites, and the idea that the temple employes the fey-boundary-keeper is semi-canon in Kiya's backstories
[2025-10-21 04:05 PM] rsulfuratus: so the undeveloped small gods tradition obviously works for that, with the idea of small gods and fey as collaborators
[2025-10-21 04:05 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-10-21 04:06 PM] Deciusmus: But actually I kinda like the idea of a pantheon that is dying out because the fey suck up too much energy, in part because the _humans_ decided to tie all the magic together
[2025-10-21 04:06 PM] rsulfuratus: i think that this could be explicitly part of the bargain ethlenn makes though with drankor. ethlenn says that these are to be linked
[2025-10-21 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: rather than fey energy weakening the gods, the fey-boundry-keeper and the like becomes of way of strengthening the gods
[2025-10-21 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: or at least by tying fey rites to the temples you do something metaphysical
[2025-10-21 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-10-21 04:08 PM] rsulfuratus: of course also mos numena are supported by a huge community of worshippers and so it doesn't matter as much what tyrwingha does
[2025-10-21 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe you have something like part of the issue was that as the gods died, the path through the land of the dead became weaker and more perilious, and you get lots of undead. part of the solution to the "Tyrwinghan Undead Crisis" is introducing Mos Numena. all kind of vague and unclear at the moment but a potential direction to explore
[2025-10-21 04:13 PM] Deciusmus: Right. At a much higher level, something like:
    
    * Tyrwinghans originated in Hkar worshipping a unique pantheon
    * They migrated/appeared/whatever to Tyrwingha (a "fey belt" with lots of fey) some undefined time before the downfall, under the protection of Ethlenn. A tradition of fey rites develops unrelated to the religious traditions.
    * By 400 DR, the original unique pantheon was metaphyiscally weak, perhaps in part due to too little attention being paid to gods instead of fey
    * Ethlenn's bargain with Drankor explicitly ties fey-rites to the temples of Mos Numena
[2025-10-21 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: From the perspective of a well-educated modern day (1700s) Tyrwinghan this comes through as:
    * We've been here forever
    * We've always been protected by Ethlenn and the fey
    * Our religion, Mos Numena, came from Drankor, and Ethlenn commanded us to accept it
    * Minding our relationship with the fey has always been important, and always been part of Mos Numena
[2025-10-21 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: From a worldbuilding/future invention perspective, this leaves some potential space for a dead and lost religion to exist in Tyrwingha/Addermarch and implies that the structure of Tyrwinghan religion has always been fairly traditionally Drankorian, it is just the temples are additionally the diplomats to the fey
[2025-10-21 04:17 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i think this works well
[2025-10-21 04:18 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the only slight gloss i'd add is that while many of the educated might think of mos numena coming from drankor, in the rural villages it might be more likely that people would think "ethlenn gave us our gods" or something like that if they bothered to think about it at all
[2025-10-21 04:18 PM] Deciusmus: Right, yes
[2025-10-21 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: So that would suggest that the miracle-remembrance aspect is probably pretty Sembaran in tradition, although I think that perhaps culturally the local feast day might be more about honoring the local fey, and so it would be more likely that in Tyrwingha the main holidays are 
    * the common ones
[2025-10-21 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: * a couple of "Greater Sembara" ones shared with Sembara
[2025-10-21 04:20 PM] Deciusmus: * a couple of Tyrwingha specific miracle remembrances
[2025-10-21 04:20 PM] Deciusmus: * a couple of local feast days to celebrate this or that fey thing
[2025-10-21 04:20 PM] Deciusmus: without the Sembaran emphasis on "village miracles"
[2025-10-21 07:29 PM] Deciusmus: Do you like the "fey festivals replace local miracle remembrances and village miracles"
[2025-10-21 07:30 PM] Deciusmus: I am writing up some "holiday" background for my players
[2025-10-21 07:31 PM] Deciusmus: and wanted to mention the differences - if we agree on them - between tyrwingha and sembara
[2025-10-21 07:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i like the basic outline from the previous message, yes
[2025-10-21 07:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess i would be inclined to not have like a hard-and-fast rule; there could be some villages that do for whatever reason have miracle rembrances local to their village.
[2025-10-21 07:57 PM] rsulfuratus: but mostly this is not a common tyrwinghan thing and outside the wider miracle events (e.g. across tyrwingha or shared with greater sembara) there is not the same flavor as sembara where ever little town has its range of miracles
[2025-10-21 08:00 PM] Deciusmus: Right yes
[2025-10-21 08:01 PM] Deciusmus: I already have one village with a local miracle
[2025-10-21 08:01 PM] Deciusmus: But I just wanted the Tyrwinghan vibe to be … we don’t really do these commonly. A village in sembara with no local miracle is unusual. A village in Tyrwingha with no local miracle is common
[2025-10-21 08:01 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i agree with that
[2025-10-21 08:03 PM] Deciusmus: Final thought… how often do these miracles change? Do villages “swap out” there miracles over time?
[2025-10-21 08:04 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, miraculous things do keep happening, it isn’t like they all happened in the distant past
[2025-10-21 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: right. there is probably some recency bias, with the caveat that really significant miracles likely have more staying power. 
    
    i think i would imagine there is kind of a component of memory here too. if your grandparents experienced a miracle and told you about it as a child, it is immediate and real. if your only connection is you celebrated the feast as a child and your grandparents told you about how their grandparents told them about the miracle, you might kind of drift away from the remembrance. 
    
    and then when something new happens and the next year people want to honor it, something eventually kinda gets quietly dropped
[2025-10-21 08:08 PM] rsulfuratus: or, there might be older / less significant miracles that still exist as feast days kinda in name only. but aren't really celebrated in any meaningful way
[2025-10-21 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: Right.
[2025-10-21 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: Makes sense
