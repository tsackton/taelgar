# Discord DM – 2023-11-23

[2023-11-23 09:39 AM] Deciusmus: I’m mostly cooking / hanging out with Z&Dana today but to the extent I’m working on stuff I’m thinking of cleaning up Gazeetteer:
    
    - make pages for all place names that don’t currently have them
    - potentially make up some names for features that don’t have them
    - create ~name~ pages for unnamed features that exist 
    
    My plan is to tag new names with status/namecheck and put in Gazeetter. Anything without a name I’ll tag with status/needs work and put in Worldbuilding/unnamed
[2023-11-23 09:40 AM] rsulfuratus: I'm still working on halflings while waiting for my pie crust to chill
[2023-11-23 09:40 AM] rsulfuratus: what is the code to get an events table for a person?
[2023-11-23 09:40 AM] rsulfuratus: (e.g. all events that mention that person's name)
[2023-11-23 09:40 AM] Deciusmus: There is a get_eventtable but I’m not sure it works
[2023-11-23 09:41 AM] Deciusmus: The stuff I was messing around with last night I didn’t commit
[2023-11-23 09:41 AM] Deciusmus: I probably should
[2023-11-23 09:42 AM] Deciusmus: Events are harder though because its not just getting pages
[2023-11-23 10:04 AM] Deciusmus: BTW, I completed all my halflings. So you can have a 100% done halflings set when you are done with halflings
[2023-11-23 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus: halflings done and pushed fyi
[2023-11-23 12:48 PM] Deciusmus: Cool. I’m working on gazetteer stuff. Should push an update soon. I’m creating ~xxx~ pages for all the major features and regions we have discussed or are obvious on the map
[2023-11-23 01:59 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed an update that has a template place name for almost everything we’ve ever talked about or that is mapped. I petered out around Voltara because I wasn’t sure which things you might have made names for
[2023-11-23 02:01 PM] rsulfuratus: I saw that. i just merged my stuff from the climate branch, which also has some place names (dangling links)
[2023-11-23 02:01 PM] rsulfuratus: will try to resolve any duplicates
[2023-11-23 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: What do you think of Aelvarsk for the highland kingdom region
[2023-11-23 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: And Elvare for “greater sembara” lowland regions
[2023-11-23 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: need to let it sit for a bit
[2023-11-23 03:10 PM] Deciusmus: I’m much less sold on Elvare or even the need for a name. But I feel like the highland kingdoms area needs a name that isn’t “the highland kingdoms”
[2023-11-23 03:13 PM] Deciusmus: Two others from chat gpt
