# Discord DM – 2025-05-27

[2025-05-27 05:58 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed an updated version of Vindristjarna Bastion rules that updates to the official versions in the DMG (from the old UA versions), and also clarifies the basic idea of how I think a mobile bastion might work (where you are constrained by space and crew instead of having to visit the bastion to gain benefits)
[2025-05-27 05:59 PM] rsulfuratus: feel free to edit, add things, etc. i doubt that anyone else in the party will engage particularly deeply
