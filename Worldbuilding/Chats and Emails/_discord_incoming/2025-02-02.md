[2025-02-02 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: So I'm struggling with trying to come up with a tone for Gazetteer landing pages that I like. This is part of why I've been going in circles on defining stuff, because it is easier to hit the right tone with "well defined" or "totally rumors" than with "sorta defined".
    
    But here are two attempts (using "Civ and Culture for the Western Green Sea") one more "in-world", one more "player"

### **Style 1: "In-World" Perspective**

> Written from the perspective of a scholar or traveler within the world.

The western [[Green Sea]] is home to many peoples, primarily humans and lizardfolk. 

Humans are, by far, the most numerous people of the region. The [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] have a long history in the [[Green Sea]] and although since the [[Great War]] they have mostly kept to themselves, Skaer sailors are commonly seen as far as [[Tollen]] and [[~South Cymea~|southern Cymea]]. [[Cymea]], once a powerful maritime empire, is in decline, and its numerous cities and coastal towns rarely exert influence beyond their borders. The lands [[~South Cymea~|to the south]], once a major [[Drankor|Drankorian province]], and later a trading partner with [[Isingue]], suffered greatly in the [[Great War]].  Although rumors of various squabbling realms have come north, few know what has emerged from the [[Blood Years]] there.

The dwarves, known for their deep halls and mountain strongholds, are said to have a presence in the southern lands. In Cymea itself, they are scarce, and in the Skaer Islands, they are all but unheard of. Perhaps some secretive enclaves exist, but none have been recorded.

Elves, while once more common, are now a rare sight. Most hail from distant Orenlas, but there are whispers of small communities of Rostare-born elves who may have found refuge here. If they exist, they keep to themselves, and few can say with certainty where they dwell.

Lizardfolk are known to dwell in great numbers within the Latazso swamp on the western border. It is believed that many venture into Cymea and beyond, though their purpose and settlements, if any, remain unclear. Some say that the southern reaches of Cymea hold hidden lizardfolk enclaves, but no one can confirm this with certainty.

The Stoneborn, if they have ever held a place in this land, have left no lasting mark. No known settlements of their kind exist here. 

As for true wilderness, the land is largely tamed, at least compared to the savage expanses of the **Drankorian Hinterland** or the **Upper Istaros**. While dangers certainly exist, the deep, untamed wilds seem to lie beyond these borders.

### **Style 2: "Player" Perspective**

> Written for players, clearly stating what is known, unknown, and undeveloped.

The region of Cymea and its surroundings is primarily home to humans, but other species are present in various ways.

- **Elves**: They are rare in this region. Most elves originate from Orenlas, but there’s an idea that some elves from Rostare may have resettled here. This has not been fully defined yet.
- **Dwarves**: There are probably significant dwarven populations around [[~South Cymea~]], but dwarves are rare in Cymea and practically nonexistent in the Skaer Islands.
- **Lizardfolk**: The Latazso swamp on the western border is a major lizardfolk homeland, so logically, there are some lizardfolk in Cymea and further south. However, the specifics of lizardfolk in southern Cymea haven’t been determined yet.
- **Humans**: Three major human cultures exist in this region: 
	- the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], who mostly settle on the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]], but are common sights as mariners across the region.
	- [[Cymea]], a Drankorian province that had a significant maritime empire sometime before the [[Great War]] but is now in decline. This is a land of city-states and coastal towns without major political cohesion
	- [[~South Cymea~]], a poorly defined Drankorian province (or perhaps multiple provinces) that suffered greatly during the [[Great War]] and [[Blood Years]]. Some type of polity has emerged, but its exact shape is unclear, although its influence on [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], [[Tollen]], and [[Tyrwingha]] is minimal
- **Stoneborn**: There’s no indication of a significant Stoneborn population here.
- **Dangerous Wilderness**: This region is relatively settled, and most "dangerous wilderness" elements will probably be placed in **Drankorian Hinterland** or **Upper Istaros** instead.

[2025-02-02 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: Ignore a bit the actual details, i.e. Rostare refugees or dwarves rare in Cymea, I was just using those as various details to work in, don't intend them to be canonical or even semi-canonical.
[2025-02-02 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus: I kind of prefer the player perspective for this
[2025-02-02 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus: i think the problem with the in-world style is that it makes it hard to deal with the difference between in-world blank spots and just "not developed"
[2025-02-02 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus: cosmology is sort of the classic case for "people in world don't have access to the truth" so it works really well to just make undeveloped things in-world questions
[2025-02-02 11:40 AM] Deciusmus: Right. That was the problem I was running into trying to write satisfying pages for Gazetteer stuff where development is incomplete
[2025-02-02 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus: but whether or not there is a significant population or an unusually low population of dwarves in cymea isn't a mystery, it just isn't decided
[2025-02-02 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus: the other alternative is something like this that I put on the shadowfolds pages:
    
    `*`(While there is more to say about the Shadowfolds, and significant lore likely exists, it largely has not been invented yet! - Eds.)*
[2025-02-02 11:41 AM] Deciusmus: Right, I didn't explore the idea of writing "in-world" with explicit callouts for "not invented but not mysterious"
[2025-02-02 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus: basically write a largely in-world page, but have italicized call-outs
[2025-02-02 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-02-02 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus: i guess the other consideration is that the gazetteer is a lot of pages. i guess maybe you are thinking just region landing pages in the in-world style? i feel like most of the gazetteer is going to be written in more of a character-facing style than a true in-world style
[2025-02-02 11:43 AM] Deciusmus: Yes, just landing
[2025-02-02 11:45 AM] Deciusmus: I think in-world style is really only valuable when
    (a) the number of pages is relatively low and there is some intrinsic fun in writing the in-world mysterious OR
    (b) there is high value in preserving in-game mystery and leaving answers to be discovered in game
[2025-02-02 11:45 AM] Deciusmus: Cosmology hits both (A) and (B). I think something like the Feywild realms section of the Gazetteer hits at least (B)
[2025-02-02 11:47 AM] Deciusmus: There might be a few other places in the Gezetteer where A or B apply (i.e. a country like Ursk or Deno'qai tribes) where it might be nice to have the "full details" under a `%%`^Campaign:DuFr`%%` or `%%`Campaign:None`%%` and a short, in-world rumors page as the main landing
[2025-02-02 11:51 AM] Deciusmus: I guess for a specific gazetteer page, it is either
    (a) highly valuable to preserve in-game secrecy (meaning the details are either under a Campaign None, Campaign DuFr, or `%%`Secret`%%` tag) and there should be a short, in-game version of the page
    (b) not well-defined, but not highly valuable to have secrecy (in which case there isn't much on the page either way, as it isn't well defined) and the page is probably best as just a player facing "not much made up, here is what is known"
    (c) well-defined and not highly valuable to have secrecy, in which case the page is likely character-facing and outlines what is known in an "in world omniscient" perspective
[2025-02-02 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-02-02 11:55 AM] Deciusmus: But I think I agree that the gazetteer landing pages are much better and easier to write as player facing and link-dense, where if for example I wanted to write an in-world history page, you just link there for details
[2025-02-02 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus: i'd suggest:
    - unlike cosmology, i don't think it is useful or achievable to have a specific tone for gazetteer
    - a lot of gazetteer secrets and undeveloped things, unlike cosmology, and things that *someone* in world knows about, just not the `*`players*, so in-world style is less useful in many (but not all) cases for finessing secrecy
    - the major driver of in-world writing should largely be fun, not game needs
    - in-world pages should use italicized editorial notes to clarify/explain undeveloped but not secret things
[2025-02-02 11:58 AM] Deciusmus: yes I agree with all that
[2025-02-02 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus: that said it might be fun to write all the region landing pages from a halfling perspective for example, which could usefully give you in-world doubts and unknowns about dangerous / fringe places, while just using editorial comments to clarify when not much is said because of lack of development
[2025-02-02 11:58 AM] Deciusmus: huh
[2025-02-02 11:58 AM] Deciusmus: that is a very interesting idea
[2025-02-02 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus: but, having player-facing region pages i think also works for simplicity
[2025-02-02 12:00 PM] Deciusmus: I might take a stab at a halfling perspective page for one of the easier/simpler regions and see how it feels from both a fun/effort and usefulness perspective
[2025-02-02 12:39 PM] Deciusmus: The halfling story of the western [[Green Sea]] is one of mariners and sailors, crumbing [[Cymea|coastal cities]] and proudly independent [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], numerous settlements along the coast, and mystery and danger inland.
    
    In the north, the halflings say, the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] are safe, and a good source of [[Skaer Steel|rare metals]] - but unwelcoming to outsiders looking to stay permanently. Those who do not worship the ocean god [[Kaikkea]] rarely find a home amongst the volcanoes and rocky hills of [[Skaerhem]]. 
    
    The [[Cymean Peninsula]], and the [[~Cymean Archipelago~]]  is a land of humans, long Drankorian provinces, and later a maritime power, it is now a place in decline. The numerous cities there are loosely called [[Cymea]] by the halflings, but a variety of different city-states squabble for dominance.
    
    _(The halflings would know the details of Cymea, including what non-humans live amongst the humans, but it hasn't been invented yet. - Eds.)_
    
    South of the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]], lies more [[~South Cymea~|human lands]], once Drankorian provinces and later, after the fall of Drankor, traders with the cities of the [[Istabor Alliance]]. Since the destruction of [[Isingue]] during the [[Great War]], this land is diminished.
    
    _(The halflings would know the details of South Cymea, including what non-humans live there, but it hasn't been invented yet. - Eds.)_
    
    Inland of the human settlements, the land turns dangerous, and halflings warn travelers away.
[2025-02-02 01:43 PM] rsulfuratus: That works quite well I think
[2025-02-02 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: what do you think:
    
    ## Major Historical Eras
    The story of the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] is well attested in religious and legendary sagas on the island, but independent verification of the facts is often difficult or impossible. The history of the [[Cymea|Cymean]] realms is difficult to untangle as many stories and chronicles have been written to justify modern events, and the truth of these chronicles is often questionable. 
    
    That said, historians in [[Tollen]] will agree on at least a broad story:
    #### Skaer Era
    _Before CY 4535_
    The [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] settled the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] in the ancient days before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], one of several human cultures that arose from the great [[~Mariners~|Mariner Exodus]] from [[Hkar]]. The Skaer established an maritime empire centered on the [[Vostok]] coast and the [[Western Gulf]], but also stretching as far south as the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]] and as far west as [[Embry]]. The Skaer claim their empire included the [[~Cymean Archipelago~]], but some [[Cymea|Cymean]] sources often describe the archipelago as uninhabited when the Drankorians arrived. Other sources claim the [[~Cymean Archipelago~]] was never Skaerish or Drankorian.
    
    (_The details of what these "other sources" say is known but not yet invented. - Eds.)_
[2025-02-02 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: #### Drankorian Era
    _CY 4535 - 5192_
    As the Drankorian Empire expanded north, coastal provinces in the lands left behind by the vanished non-human empires ([[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]] and the [[~Ancient Lizardfolk Swamp~]]) were established quickly, although sources disagree as to the exact founding dates. Many local Cymean sources ascribe unrealistically early founding dates (such as DR 2 or DR 100) to local cities and provinces but few believe these.
    
    However, by DR 402 (CY 4535) the well-attested [[Treaty of Marhavn]] was signed in [[Tollen]], which formalized that withdrawal of the [[Skaer]] from all lands and seas west of the [[Volta]] and south of the [[Straits of Cymea]]. The [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] retreated in this period, and although numerous Skaer sailing vessels were seen along the coasts of [[Vostok]] and crossing between the islands of [[Skaerhem]], the western shores and bays of the [[Green Sea]] were dominated by the Drankorians, according to modern [[Cymea|Cymean]] histories. 
    
    _(Some the Cymean sources that define a Drankorian dominance may not be accurate, but alternative versions have not been invented yet! - Eds.)_
[2025-02-02 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: #### Cymean Era
    _CY 5192 - CY 5678_
    After the fall of Drankor in DR 1059, [[Cymea]] emerged as a major maritime power, and although the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] attempted to expand in this period as well, they were not able to restore the ancient Skaer empire, and instead mostly raided the coasts of [[Sembara]] and [[Tyrwingha]]. 
    
    By the time of the [[Great War]], it was [[Cymea]], not the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]], who dominated the seas.  
    
    _(The sources for this period, including when exactly Cymea recovered from the fall of Drankor, and what Cymean cultures were competing or cooperating is hopelessly confused in the sources, and the Editors have not attempted here to untangle a most likely true version)_
    #### Tollish Era
    _(CY 5678 - Present)_
    In the aftermath of the [[Great War]], [[Cymea]] suffered much, and was never able to reclaim its place as a maritime power. Instead, the navies of [[Tollen]] filled the gap, and in the modern day it is [[Tollen]] navies that dominate [[Western Cymea]] and the shipping lanes of the western [[Green Sea]].
    
    Although the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] continue to live on their islands in relative isolation, they are no longer a power on the western [[Green Sea]].
[2025-02-02 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: ok I have zachary's d&d game shortly so I need to switch from taelgar to pulling together a few notes on the Ghosts of Saltmarsh module I'm running for him
[2025-02-02 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: But I pushed a Western Green Sea page that I'm pretty happy with
[2025-02-02 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: It is in-world with (Notes - Eds) where things are not made up. There are no intentional blank spots really so I didn't write "mysterious rumors" but you can see a little bit of how I left blank spots and undecided stuff in the historical story
[2025-02-02 06:04 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it works really well. obviously some bits are unfinished (e.g., geography / climate) and there are a few places i might add a bit of detail to cymea where i have a pretty good mental image (and there is some detail on western cymea invented but not well-documented). but i think the "halfling travelers" framework has a lot of potential. 
    
    a few other notes on history in particular:
    - halflings record the song of each year, so there is also an opportunity to place canonical events that are not well-dated as happening "in the year of gentle rain" or whatever, without indicating when exactly that is in DR / CY (although I also like the cymean conflicting claims here)
    - halflings also have their ancestral memory, which is not exactly a photographic record but can be quite useful for vibes based stuff: "the ancestors long ago recall this as a land of Drankorian people, blah blah blah..." (and of course the ancestral memory does not need to be perfect or complete, but shouldn't be totally wildly wrong)
    
    for current day stuff (civilizations and culture): 
    - i think it could use actually more of the vibes like "In the north, the halflings say, the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] are safe, and a good source of [[Skaer Steel|rare metals]] - but unwelcoming to outsiders looking to stay permanently. Those who do not worship the ocean god [[Kaikkea]] rarely find a home amongst the volcanoes and rocky islands of [[Skaerhem]]." i think that kind of thing is great
[2025-02-02 06:05 PM] rsulfuratus: (also as an aside, i think you forgot to push the region map itself?)
[2025-02-02 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: this is great too: "_(The sources for this period, including when exactly Cymea recovered from the fall of Drankor, and what Cymean cultures were competing or cooperating is hopelessly confused in the sources, and the Editors have not attempted here to untangle a most likely true version)_"
[2025-02-02 06:31 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I pushed a map
[2025-02-02 06:31 PM] Deciusmus: i had forgotten
[2025-02-02 06:32 PM] Deciusmus: the page isn't really meant to be 100% done, just far enough to show the vibe.
[2025-02-02 06:33 PM] Deciusmus: For history, I was leaning a little bit more towards the "scholars in Tollen" approach and away from the halfling one just because imagining the historical conflicts was kinda fun, and I actually think that, outside of some of the framework documents, there is something to be said for the fact that there doesn't have to be one true history.
[2025-02-02 06:34 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. it may be fine to have something like
    
    The Skaer say X and the Drankorian records say Y without ever resolving which one is actually true, as long as they don't have major present day issues
[2025-02-02 06:35 PM] Deciusmus: But I agree the halfling stuff can be a useful way to convey uncertainity of information as well, i.e. The halflings, drawing on their ancestral memory, say that no humans have touched the land until the Drankorians arrived from the south in the Year of the Gentle Rain
[2025-02-02 09:22 PM] rsulfuratus: poking around at region pages a little. i like the vibe and the basic framework a lot
[2025-02-02 09:24 PM] rsulfuratus: whatever time i have for d&d stuff between now and tuesday has to be devoted to session prep, but as a general question: there are a few corners of the world i've done some secret development on, either because i potentially thought they might come up and didn't, or because i just have an idea for something that might make a good adventure. i'm not sure how to best indicate this - if at all - on the region pages.
[2025-02-02 09:25 PM] rsulfuratus: these would usually be on the edges of the map - i think there is not much value in secret worldbuilding for e.g. the north chardon coast where there isn't any reason it would be secret in-game. more like the vargaldi type places
[2025-02-02 09:25 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`in world not in game
[2025-02-02 09:31 PM] Deciusmus: I guess it depends a bit on what the implication of the secret is/was. In some cases why does it need to be indicated?
[2025-02-02 09:35 PM] Deciusmus: Something like, I dunno, a secret group of evil awakened trees on the western slopes of the north sentinels probably doesn't need a region note at all. It is small enough that it isn't really going to impact worldbuilding in the region and its sorta dubiously canonical, in that if it never comes up in an adventure is it really real?
[2025-02-02 09:39 PM] Deciusmus: Something like the Vargarldi, pre-discovery, which you want to be canonical even if we had never found them, is probably best done exactly how I wrote the vargardli text on the main northern green sea coast - I'm not sure there is huge value in keeping the fact that there are northerns up there secret - the interesting in game reveal was the details
[2025-02-02 09:48 PM] Deciusmus: There is probably stuff in between where it might make sense to add a short note in the DM Notes section (either on brainstorming or canonical, depending) to say something to just point out some minimal details of where the secret is
