# Discord DM – 2024-09-02

[2024-09-02 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus: do you have a pro subscription to inkarante or is the free version good enough for the maps you've made for e.g. barony of aveil?
[2024-09-02 11:45 AM] Deciusmus: Pro susbscription
[2024-09-02 11:45 AM] Deciusmus: I think the free doesnt have very many good stamps
[2024-09-02 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus: ah yeah looking at now, free is pretty minimal
[2024-09-02 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus: btw at some point I'm thinking of making a vector-based world hex map to be a slightly better organized version of the "canonical map", probably using the Adventurer Conqueror King system (smallest unit is the 6 mile hex, which aggregate to 24 mile hexes), but then I'd likely add a rough 85 x 85 mile square (1 degree latitude) and a 425 mile square. so on the large map you'd have a 20x20 grid as the biggest aggregation, with each grid cell representing 5 degrees latitude, and breaking down into 25 smaller squares, with each smaller square containing ~12 big hexes
[2024-09-02 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus: main question is what to make it in
[2024-09-02 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus: would not be designed to be player facing so doesn't have to look good
[2024-09-02 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus: but ideally would be editable by both of us
[2024-09-02 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus: and would be done with vectors so zoomable
[2024-09-02 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: I read your addermarch  history which in general I quite like. The idea of the rangers originating as guerilla bands against Atavus in the 1400s is very appealing
[2024-09-02 04:28 PM] rsulfuratus: Two unrelated questions:
    (1) did you ever make up anything about the Mos Numena holiday of thanksgiving / salvation that marks escape from Hkar?
    (2) how would elves think about war dead? would their be memorials? graves? seems like they would be treated differently than elves who leave when they want
[2024-09-02 04:28 PM] rsulfuratus: Surprisngly, trying to work out answers as part of Colorado session prep
[2024-09-02 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: Never made up anything in the Mos Numena holiday.
[2024-09-02 04:30 PM] Deciusmus: On elven war dead, I think there would be some sense of lose, like they were artificially cut off from Adanor
[2024-09-02 04:31 PM] Deciusmus: So a memorial might celebrate that connection and therefore be living?
[2024-09-02 04:32 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah like the idea of something living. mostly want to check that it wouldn't seem weird for their to be elven memorials to the war dead, in the same sense it would be weird to have elven graveyards.
[2024-09-02 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: The first thought that comes to mind is something like an elaborate and enormous flowering tree. I think the vibe would very much be about memorializing the connection to Aldanor. Perhaps even something spontaneous- like the elven forest expressing its own loss of these elves who were still entangled with the mortal world
[2024-09-02 04:35 PM] Deciusmus: I’m not sure elves would build memorials so much as tend to them
[2024-09-02 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: One thought on addermarch - the history of 1720-1740 might be a bit hard to work out esp as it relates to Duskmire and the fey. I’m not sure if you are planning much fey involvement in the family campaign though
[2024-09-02 04:38 PM] rsulfuratus: Nathaniel wants to be a warlock with an archfey patron
[2024-09-02 04:38 PM] rsulfuratus: but i doubt that requires lots of details
[2024-09-02 04:39 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. doesn't really matter if something dramatic happens to Umbreath in your campaign
[2024-09-02 04:39 PM] rsulfuratus: as long as like the Darkwood is not cleansed of all darkness or something
[2024-09-02 04:40 PM] rsulfuratus: in any case i want him to be free to be silly and creative so not planning on trying to connect his fey patron to more established lore, particularly
[2024-09-02 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: Right, makes sense. There are a bunch of spaces for random minor fey lords along the sunset gate
[2024-09-02 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: That are broadly “good” and aligned with Ethlenn
[2024-09-02 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: i was either going to do that, or someone from the talking animals realm
[2024-09-02 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: since I think nathaniel would like a talking animals fey patron
[2024-09-02 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: Ah, sure.
[2024-09-02 04:43 PM] rsulfuratus: which could also be along sunset gate, just further north, so would make more sense if he wants to be from somewhere "far away"
[2024-09-02 04:46 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah it could also be to the west a bit, north of duskmire and overlapping zimkova
[2024-09-02 04:48 PM] rsulfuratus: right, I was just looking at the old feywild map you made
[2024-09-02 04:48 PM] rsulfuratus: which we should really put in obsidian at some point
[2024-09-02 04:48 PM] Deciusmus: I thought I did in worldbuilding but maybe not
[2024-09-02 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: sent you an invite link for an adobe fresco hex map of Addermarch / Sembaran borderlands / Tyrwingha to test out. I think simple editing is free, should work on windows or ipad
[2024-09-02 07:45 PM] rsulfuratus: FYI I also made up with the help of maps + chatGPT about 50 village names derived from Gaelic or Old French / Norman French, sometimes with Old English mixed in, and got chat GPT to make up folk entymologies for all of them, if useful in the brainstorming section of wordlbuilding. if you use any, mark as used
[2024-09-02 09:43 PM] Deciusmus: seems to require photoshop subscription
