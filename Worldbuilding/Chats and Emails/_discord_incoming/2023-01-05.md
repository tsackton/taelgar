# Discord DM – 2023-01-05

[2023-01-05 08:22 AM] Deciusmus: I’m reconsidering whether 100 years is the right time distance between my game and “mainline” Taelgar…
[2023-01-05 08:24 AM] Deciusmus: There are some advantages but it also makes things in this shared obsidian notes world a bit harder and less synergistic…
    - it’s a but awkward on things like sembaran royalty as either the doc just stops in 1650, leaving a weird ~100 year gap, or alternatively the site for my players has all kinds of weird future history
[2023-01-05 08:27 AM] Deciusmus: If that was the only problem, I’d just live with it, but it also seems a shame to not be able to reasonably share little things. i.e. if my game ends up in Tokra, it was a pretty different place 100 years ago… if our game ends up in Clenseau, or Embry, or other places like that where I will have made up a bunch of small details… harder for you to reuse
[2023-01-05 08:28 AM] Deciusmus: (Although I noticed that you reused the last inn in delwaths scry — I assume that’s where Marcella is…)
[2023-01-05 08:40 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah that is where Marcella is
[2023-01-05 08:42 AM] rsulfuratus: not sure what the best time gap is, though
[2023-01-05 08:42 AM] Deciusmus: I can’t really decide if there is a downside to setting my game say in 1738
[2023-01-05 08:43 AM] Deciusmus: Other than having to rejigger some plot around the lich
[2023-01-05 08:44 AM] Deciusmus: Or even 1745 or something like that so it would eventually catch up
[2023-01-05 08:45 AM] rsulfuratus: I think it kind of depends a little on what your long term plot / campaign structure is
[2023-01-05 08:46 AM] rsulfuratus: if you end up going to Sembara in the Dunmar campaign, I don't necessarily want it to be in the middle of some major crisis
[2023-01-05 08:48 AM] rsulfuratus: if I remember the backstory right you have some complicated sembaran politics and the lich ruling over the kingdom....I'd prefer that not be happening concurrently with our game
[2023-01-05 08:49 AM] rsulfuratus: sembara in 1748 has throughout our game been a place that seems safe and stable - wellby left because it was boring, marcella is running there because it is safe, etc.
[2023-01-05 08:52 AM] rsulfuratus: but a 20-30 year gap might make more sense than a 100 year gap, basically a generation ago
[2023-01-05 08:56 AM] Deciusmus: So the very-high-level campaign arc is:
    
    Levels 1-6: Set in Clenseau, mostly small episodic things, potentially several years of game-time. During this period a lich is secretly ruling Sembara.
    Level 7: The party finds out the lich has been defeated (although they don't have anything to do with it). They end up saving the life of the new ruler (currently expected to be Elaine II) when she is touring the kingdom on a royal circuit
    Level 8-14: They get called to court and various people approach them with problems. These at some point lead to a discovery (currently expected to be in the western marches) that the lich is actually still alive and is in a complicated struggle with some mind flayers. They party goes to various old haunts of the lich (Tollen, highland kingdoms) to find details about his past (ala the horocruxes in Harry Potter) and eventually defeats him.
    Level 14+ Unclear, but likely somehow related to the Far Realms
[2023-01-05 08:57 AM] Deciusmus: The intention is for the level 7+ stuff to be set during a peaceful period of recovery in Sembara. The lich`<->`mindflayer struggle is taking place deep in the underdark/on the fringes of civilization, not in the halls of power or farmlands of Sembara
[2023-01-05 08:58 AM] rsulfuratus: right. and I have no real interest or intention on adding an underdark arc to our Dunmar campaign, so that works well
[2023-01-05 08:59 AM] rsulfuratus: I think I would just like the "oh crap a lich was secretly ruling Sembara" plot to have some distance from the present
[2023-01-05 09:01 AM] Deciusmus: So maybe the lich is defeated in say, the early 1720s?
[2023-01-05 09:01 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah I was wondering if it would work for you and your players to have a substantial time skip, like 10 years, in the middle of your campaign
[2023-01-05 09:01 AM] Deciusmus: Actually, several of them asked for that
[2023-01-05 09:02 AM] Deciusmus: the guy who is playing the orphan kid with the far realm patron was hoping for a longer time jump than I was planning orignally
[2023-01-05 09:02 AM] Deciusmus: his original vision was the kid was like, 8 or 9 at the beginning of the game and in his 20s by the level 8-14 stuff
[2023-01-05 09:03 AM] rsulfuratus: so you could do part 1 (lich ruling secretly) in the 1720s, and then jump ~15 years for the 8-14 stuff to have that happen say 5-10 years before the Dunmar campaign
[2023-01-05 09:05 AM] rsulfuratus: really there is no need to decide the time skip now, right? our dunmar campaign might be over by the time you get to level 8. i'm kind of expecting another ~2 - 2 1/2 years for the dunmar campaign given the pace of leveling so far
[2023-01-05 09:05 AM] rsulfuratus: but something like a 15 year jump from the lich time to the "approximately current" time could work well
[2023-01-05 09:07 AM] Deciusmus: yeah; I'm expecting the 1-6 stuff to take ~1 - 1.5 years of real life. I have 6 "episodes" planned each with 1-3 (mostly 2) sessions, and basically leveling after each one. But we will probably only play 10 times in 2023, so finishing that will likely spill into 2024
[2023-01-05 09:08 AM] Deciusmus: The main thing is I need to know if I'm planning a more significant time jump, to let my players plan starting ages and character arcs a bit
[2023-01-05 09:10 AM] Deciusmus: let me noodle around a bit
[2023-01-05 09:10 AM] Deciusmus: How committed are you to Arryn II and Derik VI's regnal years?
[2023-01-05 09:11 AM] rsulfuratus: Arryn III? I think only shows up in Wellby backstory dates, so really doesn't matter
[2023-01-05 09:11 AM] Deciusmus: sorry, I mean Arryn III
[2023-01-05 09:11 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah, only shows up as dates in Wellby's backstory. doesn't matter at all
[2023-01-05 09:12 AM] Deciusmus: Wellby would have been around in Sembara when the lich was alive, right?
[2023-01-05 09:12 AM] Deciusmus: I mean, I think he'd be a kid? I'm not actually sure how old Wellby was
[2023-01-05 09:12 AM] Deciusmus: `*`is
[2023-01-05 09:12 AM] rsulfuratus: Wellby was born 1722
[2023-01-05 09:14 AM] rsulfuratus: he is basically pippin
[2023-01-05 09:15 AM] rsulfuratus: but actually it works well for Wellby's backstory to have Sembara be in a bit of chaos in his early childhood, as his family was mostly at sea and then settled into a boring routine recently, in the 1740s
[2023-01-05 09:26 AM] rsulfuratus: on a separate topic, do you have any idea why images aren't showing up in the github.io pages? I checked both yours and mine
[2023-01-05 09:26 AM] rsulfuratus: e.g https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/The%20Central%20Highlands%20Region/Zarkandur.html
[2023-01-05 09:26 AM] rsulfuratus: https://msackton.github.io/taelgar1650/Gazetteer/The%20Central%20Highlands%20Region/Zarkandur.html
[2023-01-05 09:27 AM] rsulfuratus: but the Zarkandur image is in both of our repos
[2023-01-05 09:55 AM] rsulfuratus: no idea why but by fiddling around I figured out that if I rename the _media folder to something that doesn't start with an underscore, it works. so I have images in assets now
[2023-01-05 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: yeah, I saw the same thing
[2023-01-05 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: I assume some default filter on _
[2023-01-05 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: I was going to try renaming but hadn't gotten to it
[2023-01-05 10:51 AM] Deciusmus: Here is my revamped Sembaran royal line:
    
    * Cece I, the great queen who ruled over a long peaceful era reigned 1652 - 1712
    * She was unlucky with children; none survived to suceed her exceed Robert I, reigned 1712 - 1722
    * Robert was actually replaced by the lich in 1719
    
    After Robert / the lich dies, a cadet branch of the house takes over, starting with:
    * Elaine II (reigned 1722 - 1745)
    * followed by her second son, Arryn III (reigned 1745 - ??)
[2023-01-05 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: this retcons only the name of the monarch of sembara when Wellby was born (switched from Derik VII to Elaine II) and when Arryn III began his reign
[2023-01-05 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: Elaine II is intentionally meant to call back to Cece I and represent a "rebirth of long era of peace and prospertity"
[2023-01-05 10:53 AM] Deciusmus: and Arryn III presumably follows in his mother's footsteps in that regard, keeping present day Sembara quiet and well-ruled
[2023-01-05 10:54 AM] Deciusmus: the only other big impact is that I like having Cece I be the one who ends the hobgoblin wars, and for some of the western marches to be still war-scarred in my campaign. So this moves some hobgoblin campaigns int he western marches from the 1590s to the 1660s
[2023-01-05 10:54 AM] Deciusmus: I dunno if that disrupts anything elsewhere in the world
[2023-01-05 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus: so the general grand sweep of things is that cha'mutte had these huge armies in the north, and when he dies all the magic that sustains their logistics falls apart, and so a great host (led by a dragon conclave, and consisting of hobgoblins, trolls, giants, etc) sweeps south from Pandar. this is what destroys most of the pre-Great War polities in the west, and forges Chardon into an empire. the advance is stopped outside of Chardon in the 1550s (so maybe a ~7 year war), and then there is probably two decades of reconquest and resettlement as Chardonian forces move north; perhaps this goes in a few pulses, with some gaps, the timeline is not exactly clear (except that the current northernmost border city, Voltara is only about ~50 years old, so must have been founded around 1700).
[2023-01-05 11:10 AM] rsulfuratus: the original idea was that the remnant hobgoblins who survive Chardon flee into the mountains, east and south, and emerge as threats to sembara in the 1580s-1590s, and Dunmar in the 1600-1610, with both countries largely peaceful by the 1620s
[2023-01-05 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus: but this is not canon anywhere - I can't change the Dunmar timeline but the Sembara timeline is not introduced in play anywhere (except as a retconned date for the stone titan one shot in Dunmore, but that could happen at any time and was self-contained that shifting the date around doesn't matter)
[2023-01-05 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus: so you could easily have: Chardon defeats dragon conclave, hobgoblins scatter; some regroup in the northern parts of Dunmar and there is a war there in the 1600s, but hobgoblins are defeated and scatter again. in the 1640s or whenever, a new hobgoblin leader arises who starts to attract recruits and settlers, and a new threat grows
[2023-01-05 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus: the only other thing is the history beats that outline the dissolution of greater sembara into the various modern day pieces work well now. so that means either stretching out the chaos in sembara for an extra 50 years (meaning the "blood years" run roughly from 1545-1565 in the west, 1545-1610 in Dunmar, and 1545-1660 in Sembara), or inserting another peaceful interlude in the middle that is disrupted again by the new hobgoblin frontier (which means the fortifications of the marches would have probably happened prior to Cece, but there would still be the scars of the second war)
[2023-01-05 01:45 PM] Deciusmus: What about something like the following...
    
1550s: Hobgoblins stopped near Chardon
1580s: Hobgoblins pushed over the mountains towards Sembara; hobgoblin war in Sembara
1580s-1600: Hobgoblins driven back by a series of weak rulers, but not crushed. 
1600s-1610: Hobgoblins move towards Dunmar and defeated badly in Dunmar
1610s - 1640s: Chardon and Dunmar peaceful. A stalemate of sorts in Sembara some significant reserves of hobgoblins both in the southern mountains (around where the March of Andonne is now) and the eastern edges of the [[Crimson Forest]] and the elderwood
1650ish: a new leader arises amongst these hobgoblins and sweeps into Sembara from the west and south, devasting the areas in the southwest
1650s: Cece comes to the throne, a young queen of just barely 20, facing this hobgoblin onslaught, and gains a reptuation as Derik III reborn by basically winning a series of decisive victories, heralding effectively a century of peace in Sembara
[2023-01-05 01:58 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think the basic outline works. the exact details of where hobgoblins are in between wars probably doesn't matter for the moment. but the new leader arising among the hobgoblins turning what is basically a long-term frozen conflict with little actual fighting into a serious war works well
[2023-01-05 02:02 PM] rsulfuratus: you could have sort of a vikings in england from 850-1000 kind of vibe
[2023-01-05 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: Here is my new regnal list:
    
    House of Sewick (1420s - 1720s)
    
    Derik I
    Derik II
    Charlotte I
    Derik III
    Bertram I
    Bertram II
    Blanche I
    Wisym I
    Elaine I
    Arryn I
    Blanche II
    Arryn II
    Charlotte II
    Cece I
    Robert I
    
    House of Lils (1720s - present)
    Elaine II
    Arryn III
[2023-01-05 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: it retcons the ruler in Wellby's background to be Elaine II when he is born
[2023-01-05 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: and retcons the year Arryn III came to the throne although he is still the kind
[2023-01-05 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: put it in notes and I'll update the links in Wellby's background, which I'm sure Schwartz will never notice
[2023-01-05 06:04 PM] Deciusmus: Major Eras:
    Founding - 1420s - 1550 (Derik I - Derik III)
    Blood Years - 1550 - 1590 (Bertram I - Elaine I)
    Stalemate - 1590 - 1650 (Arryn I - Charlotte II)
    War + Pax Sembara - 1650 - 1710 (Cece I + Robert I)
    Lich - Robert I (1719-1722)
    Renewed Peace + Prosperty - House of Lils, 1720s - now
[2023-01-05 07:01 PM] Deciusmus: Do you want me to push a PR first or just push straight to main
[2023-01-05 07:02 PM] rsulfuratus: straight to main is fine
