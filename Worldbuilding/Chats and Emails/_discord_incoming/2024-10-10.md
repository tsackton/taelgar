# Discord DM – 2024-10-10

[2024-10-10 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus: i am going to push all my notes on Ra'ghemdros' hoard later tonight. if it would be entertaining for you to work out exactly what you can take with you given the space constraints in the portable hole, there are volume notes there. if you'd find that tedious, i'll just pick some arbitrary stuff focusing on diamonds/rubies. i highly doubt anyone else would take time out of session to sort through things and session time is better saved for magic items
[2024-10-10 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus: once I finally get caught up from colorado and finish making up drankor, i'm going to return to the dm notes / dm status stuff....but unclear when that will be tbh
[2024-10-10 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: I may take a look later
[2024-10-10 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: But at the moment am focused on prep for my game this weekend, plus a lot of work
[2024-10-10 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: I assume you have no objections to the following being canonical:
    * Something magical about Ethlenn specifically makes fey gates appear or perhaps just strengthens existing portals
    * This magic can, in some fashion, flow towards powerful people under her protection
    * Neither of these facts are well understood in Tyrwingha, although presumably the Oracle of the Riven knows them
[2024-10-10 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: no that all seems fine
[2024-10-10 02:36 PM] rsulfuratus: although not quite sure what the second bullet point means?
[2024-10-10 02:37 PM] rsulfuratus: i also need two more magic items from the dragon hoard if you have any ideas
[2024-10-10 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: Basically I need a MacGuffin to make it so that Elaine II's heart/body/death in some fashion would strengthen a fey gate
[2024-10-10 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: (or perhaps sacrifice)
[2024-10-10 02:37 PM] rsulfuratus: ah
[2024-10-10 02:37 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2024-10-10 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: The exact details of the macguffin don't matter for a while actually.
[2024-10-10 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, certainly it would make sense for people under Ethlenn's protection to have an echo of her magic.
[2024-10-10 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: i think in general fey portals should never, or rarely, be "simple". so far all the ones that exist seem like they require certain conditions to be met in order to activate them. they are way, way, more common than portals to elsewhere (which, generally, are very rare and isolated and require things like going to the heart of an active volcano or a deep trench in the western gulf)
[2024-10-10 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: but that doesn't mean there is a ton of easy traffic between the feywild and the material plane
[2024-10-10 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g., lastlight falls is only open for a moment at sunset each day, that kind of thing
[2024-10-10 02:41 PM] rsulfuratus: hence why imo the original settlers often marked portals with things like standing stones, to warn people, because maybe if you are wearing the wrong clothing (a necklace made of a certain kind of common flower) you find yourself in the feywild suddenly because the portal is open for you
[2024-10-10 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: so ethlenn, perhaps, is able to stablize these portals in a way to allow her favored people to travel more easily, and this is in some sense the basis of the bargain with the people of tyrwingha
[2024-10-10 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: Secondarily, I kinda like the idea of leaving it undetermined whether or not the fey portal in the woods north of  Cleenseau is closed permanently or kept open permanently. I am presuming my pcs will succeed, but although I have a backup plan to keep Elaine alive if they fail to stop her from being kidnapped, it involves Umbraeth ultimately succeeding in his plan to create a permanent portal. 
    
    The region is irrelevant to Dunmar campaign but it could potentially impact Addermarch game?
[2024-10-10 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: it is far enough away from addermarch probably wont come up for a while
[2024-10-10 02:46 PM] rsulfuratus: plus that game is more like an adventure of the week thing at the moment anyway
[2024-10-10 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: Basically, my plan for the next 5-10 sessions of my game is basically...
    
    (a) Umbraeth decides to betray the lich (PCs may or may not find out about this)
    (b) Lich is killed and news spreads
    (c) This is part of Umbraeth's plan, because he wants to bring Elaine to Cleenseau region. He might even be working behind the scenes to encourage a royal tour once she is Queen
    (d) He sends minions to kidnap her and bring her to the feywild
    (e) My players either - 
    1) stop the minions but fail to follow up on clues and go into the feywild to destroy the gate permanently (or go, but fail to successfully destroy the gate). At this point the portal stays unstable, flickering on and off randomly over the years.
    2) stop the minions and go into the feywild, and destroy the gate
    3) fail to stop the minions (and which point some powerful fey from Twilight's Grace will swap places with Elaine for Reasons), at which point the portal becomes permanent and the heart of the Cleenseau wood starts to become much more fey infested
[2024-10-10 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus: i am cleaning up status tags and don't recall if we ever settled on something for "nothing on this page is wrong, there is nothing that is missing in the sense of 'there are notes elsewhere', but probably it could use more thought"
[2024-10-10 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess just no status tag? e.g. for A  Synthesis of Humanity in Greater Sembara, which was tagged status/check/tim. what is there seems basically right to me, but there are some cultural strands not considered, e.g. Isingue and Cymea
[2024-10-10 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: I think we basically decided either
    (A) no tag if the page seems publishable/useable as is
    (B) cleanup/internal if the info is useable but the writing needs work
    (C) needsworks if the page seems too barebones to even be published/useable
