# Discord DM – 2025-01-29

[2025-01-29 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: I've been working too much today so taking a little break to think some more about Chardonian history... it wouldn't do to work the _entire_ day on work...
[2025-01-29 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: Here's the version I have so far, slightly modified from last night, and trying to leave the right "blank spaces" while still being a solid framework.
    
    `**`Great War and Blood Years**
    In Chardon this is basically 1545 - 1597 (the defeat of the Umbral Covenant being the conventional "end of the Blood Years") in Chardon at least.
    
    There are a couple of major things happening here:
    
    1548(ish) - 1558(ish): Conclave War. Wipes out all human civilizations north of Lake Valandros and east of the coastal mountains, although it doesn't necessarily kill all the humans. 
    
    1550s - 1560s: Hobgoblin advance. Methodically moves south along the North Chardon Coast.
    
    1545 - 1590ish: Mawar fog/isolation.
    
    1559 - 1584: Apporian pirate kingdoms
    
    1584 - 1597: War of the Dark Rift
    
    post 1560: settlement of Chasa River valley by Chardonians
[2025-01-29 03:47 PM] Deciusmus: By the end of this period, the following things need to be true:
    * Mawar feels safe enough to dismiss the fog
    * Chardon starts to become truly imperial, absorbing the Approian provinces in the aftermath of the War of the Dark Rift
[2025-01-29 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: The following things should not have happened yet:
    * Chardon absorbs/conqueors the North Chardon coast, Lake Valandaros, of Voltara
[2025-01-29 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: Unclear:
    * What is happening in the Yeraad river
[2025-01-29 04:01 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm pretty busy today but a few quick thoughts
[2025-01-29 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: (1) It is probably useful to sketch out a little more clearly the "state of play" w/r/t hobgoblins in 1545. 
    
    the major concentrations of Cha'mutte's armies are in the Dunmar/Isingue border area, and in Pandar, with scattered concentrations elsewhere. 
    
    a part of the southern armies (Iron Fang) move quickly against Sembara and are defeated in the Bloodlust War
    
    the rest of the southern armies establish on the eastern frontier of Dunmar and are involved in a series of wars from 1550s - 1610
    
    the northern armies are canonically larger and also potentially more desparate, as one must presume that pandar does not have the agricultural capacity to feed a large army without magic. 
    
    the shattered ice clan moves against sembara across the mountains in the 1570s in some notes (timing is around 1st hobgoblin war), but in other notes the shattered ice clan is not involved in the 1st hobgoblin war. there is a semi-canonical idea they were somehow pushed over the mountains by chardonian expansion but i'm not sure the geography works super well.
[2025-01-29 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: So I just was reading up on this in various chats/docs
[2025-01-29 04:10 PM] rsulfuratus: dated way back the original idea of the "Blood Years" was basically, Cha'mutte is defeated but his armies are not, so this all works well, but the exact movements are a little ambiguous at the moment and fairly important to post-Great War history of the west coast
[2025-01-29 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: A related point: where are hobgoblins now?
[2025-01-29 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: Which also plays into west coast history
[2025-01-29 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: Currently the world vibe in ongoing campaigns has not had major hobgoblin wars as a theme, so they are probably pretty scattered but not likely extinct
[2025-01-29 04:12 PM] Deciusmus: The semi-canonical view is:
    ** Southern army becomes Iron Fang + Bitter Knife **
    * Iron Fang is defeated quickly by Sembara but only partially, and becomes the mad scientist plagueland hobgoblins (who are still around)
    * Bitter Knife has a longer series of wars against Dunmar, but is defeated more throughouly
    ** Northern army splits into 2 branches, the "western north" branch and the "eastern north" branch**
    * Eastern north branch is the key troops of the conclave war. Defeated by Chardon in the 1550s/1560 timeframe they regroup and push west over the mountains into Sembara in the 1570s to be the first hobgoblin war in Sembar
    * western north tbd
[2025-01-29 04:14 PM] rsulfuratus: So all three hobgoblin wars are same group on sembara?
[2025-01-29 04:14 PM] Deciusmus: for the eastern north, I think the geography works pretty well. they are defeated by Chardon in the chasa valley
![[../_discord_assets/image-4DFA8.png]]
[2025-01-29 04:14 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that is the point I was confused on
[2025-01-29 04:14 PM] Deciusmus: and move into the foothills of the sentinels, lick their wounds, and then cross near urlich to attack dunmore area
[2025-01-29 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: in some earlier conversations the stone titan one-shot was in the opening wars of the 1st hobgoblin war, where the hobgoblins were allied with mind flayers
[2025-01-29 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: But yes, to answer your question, all 3 hobgoblin wars were shatted ice
[2025-01-29 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: The Shatted Ice page actually contradicts that
[2025-01-29 04:15 PM] rsulfuratus: Yes. That is what is was reading
[2025-01-29 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: But all of them as shattered ice works much better
[2025-01-29 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: But the history timeline and the long discord chat from 2 years ago changed that
[2025-01-29 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: the discord chat - grand sweep of history wa the last time we did this
[2025-01-29 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: This is basically the group that flees the conclave war defeat
[2025-01-29 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: I never updated the shattered ice page after that convo
[2025-01-29 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2025-01-29 04:17 PM] rsulfuratus: Currently maybe hiding in small bands in marginal terrain in the sentinels and occasionally raiding but clearly significantly reduced in impact and power. And also maybe  in conflict with whatever east sentinel hobgoblin clans managed to hide from cha’mutte
[2025-01-29 04:18 PM] Deciusmus: Right. My 1720s vibe is that the western army still fights scattered hobgoblin raiders but it is a very unequal fight
[2025-01-29 04:18 PM] rsulfuratus: So to go back to west coast history, a major decision point is are there hobgoblins here now. Since that will determine history of the western advance
[2025-01-29 04:18 PM] Deciusmus: By 1740s unclear but the situation could have just continued
[2025-01-29 04:19 PM] rsulfuratus: The only things we are sure of about the west advance is it lagged the conclave war for some reason, it was less destructive (more conquering, less dragonfire), and it took a while for Chardon to gain strength to win a series of campaigns
[2025-01-29 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I think the whole "post cha'mutte" hobgoblin stuff is pretty settled except:
    * where did the blackened claw clan that fought around Raven's Hold come from?
    * what happened to the "west north" branch who were not part of the conclave war
[2025-01-29 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: then separately, there are known hobgoblin settlements in the plaguelands ("Iron Fang ->` mad scientist, but they are keeping to themselves brewing challenges for a level 18 party) and in the southern sentinels just soth of urlich, in the headwaters of the Yeraad River and probably in the spur stretching out towards Maseau
[2025-01-29 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: the "southern sentinel" ones are the descendants of the Shattered Ice clan
[2025-01-29 04:22 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2025-01-29 04:26 PM] rsulfuratus: yes. so basically to date, the canonical hobgoblins are mostly either (a) hiding in the plaguelands doing their thing, or (b) scattered, small groups eking out a living marginal terrain around the edges of the sentinels, which based on my very very very old notes is more or less a return to the pre-Great-War status quo except with the hogoblins weaker and more disoganized
[2025-01-29 04:26 PM] rsulfuratus: (plus the realm on Irrla)
[2025-01-29 04:28 PM] rsulfuratus: in the immediate aftermath of the Great War, however, you have three major areas of hobgoblin settlement:
    - Chardon north coast (??? tbd)
    - southern Greater Sembara (Shattered Knife)
    - Nashtkar / western plaguelands area (this is where Bitter Knife and Blackened Claw hobgobilns come from)
[2025-01-29 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: + northern plaguelands (Iron Fang)
[2025-01-29 04:29 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-01-29 04:29 PM] rsulfuratus: however, you don't ever really get hobgoblin settlement on the eastern side of the west coast (the "Conclave War" path). in part because the Conclave War is in some sense a war of revenge against the elves/humans/Chardon and is intentionally destructive, in part because Chardon wins much more decisively in the end
[2025-01-29 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: so I think it is somthing like this:
[2025-01-29 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: where the red is movement is the grey is settlement
[2025-01-29 04:35 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-7AFAE.png]]
[2025-01-29 04:35 PM] Deciusmus: better version
[2025-01-29 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: S = southern army
    splits into 1 = iron fang (still around) and 2 = bitter knife/blackened claw (defeated by dunmar)
[2025-01-29 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: N = northern army
    splits into 3 = shattered ice, still around
    4 = ???
[2025-01-29 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: the open questions are then all basically around 4 = where did they come from? where did they go?
[2025-01-29 04:39 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-01-29 04:41 PM] rsulfuratus: so then if we look at this map
![[../_discord_assets/west-coast-history-GreatWar-D1F1D.png]]
[2025-01-29 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it implies there is some kind of split early on in cha'mutte's armies basically as soon as cha'mutte dies
[2025-01-29 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: I half wonder if they didn't come from the ocean
[2025-01-29 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: what if they sailed across the north bay, tried to land in mawar, were pushed away by the fog, and made their away around to the north chardon coast
[2025-01-29 04:43 PM] rsulfuratus: in my original map i have them coming across the bay and through the gap between tawir forest and the mountains
[2025-01-29 04:43 PM] Deciusmus: that could work too, although the "go around mawar" could be a reason they are delayed compared to the conclave war
[2025-01-29 04:44 PM] Deciusmus: it also makes it easier for "who knows" type answers - they appeared on the coast.
[2025-01-29 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: right but that isn't going to delay them for 5 years or whatever
[2025-01-29 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: also, keep in mind that by 1545, Cha'mutte has already conquered probably as far south as the blackwater fens
[2025-01-29 04:45 PM] rsulfuratus: so the yellow "kingdom 4" is already subjugated or destroyed
[2025-01-29 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: a reasonable story is that cha'mutte is originally intending to move the north army south and the south army north to conquer both sides of ulrich pass for whatever reason the "monastery" is so important to the kill the gods goal
[2025-01-29 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: but actions of the high school campaign force an accelerated timeline so just dumps a bunch of hobgoblins in the pass via magic shadow portals
[2025-01-29 04:47 PM] rsulfuratus: so i think the most likely starting point is that, when the Great War ends in 1545, Pandar effectively covers the "Cha'mutte arrows", the forest of dreams, and "kingdom 4"
[2025-01-29 04:49 PM] rsulfuratus: a side point is that when cha'mutte dies there is a major kenku revolt in pandar. and without magic pandar probably becomes pretty inhospitable, certainly not a place that can support anything close to the popuation density living there in the 1530s or whenever
[2025-01-29 04:49 PM] rsulfuratus: but it isn't like the blackwater fens is great agricultural land either
[2025-01-29 04:50 PM] rsulfuratus: my feeling is the most likely reason for the delay is actually that hobgoblins set up an early hobgoblin kingdom in Voltara area, more or less
[2025-01-29 04:53 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a bunch of tentative history from the Great Library campaign, involving Airion the Mistspeaker (who shows up a lot in various places immediately pre Great War) and a hint of a war that the people in kingdom 2 at least, maybe 1/2/5, fought and lost against hobgoblins where they were angry that chardon didn't come to their aid
[2025-01-29 04:56 PM] Deciusmus: Right so basically whatever is going on up north 1545 - 1560 it
    (a) spawns the conclave wars
[2025-01-29 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: (b) delays the "Unnamed West" hobgoblins
    (c) wipes out all of the human realms although potentially not (yellow kingdom 5) and potentially not all of the humans (i.e. some scattered refugees are potentially around to form new kingdoms to be conquered by chardon)
[2025-01-29 04:58 PM] Deciusmus: by late 1550s the "unnamed west" hobgoblins are moving south (for potentially unclear reasons) and methodically conqueor the north chardon coast
[2025-01-29 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: in 1565 or so some battle is fought perhaps along one of the unnamed rivers (farthest south one?) that halts the advance
[2025-01-29 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: and you end up with a bit of frozen conflict, like in sembara
[2025-01-29 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: so in 1565 you have:
    (a) a relatively large hobgoblin empire stretching all along the north coast
    (b) formally at peace with Chardon
    (c) which has defeated the Conclave hobgoblins and is rapidly expanding up the chasa river
    (d) some scattered humans - perhaps even a coherent kingdom - in the coast of the north bay
    (e) the defeated conclave hobgoblins licking their wounds to the east
[2025-01-29 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: that kinda leaves Lake Valandros and north as a "no mans land" and easy to leave blank for whatever we want to show up there later
[2025-01-29 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: then, you need either
    (a) Mawar to open up earlier (I think not great for the Mawar timeline) or 
    (b) something to change by the 1590s so that the hobgoblin empire doesn't seem as much of a threat as it was in the 1570s
[2025-01-29 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: or 
    (c) Mawar to never have been worried about the hobgoblin empire per se, but to have other reasons to stay in the fog in 1570s but not by 1590s
[2025-01-29 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: (My preference is b but I don't have a strong idea as to what that could be)
[2025-01-29 05:12 PM] rsulfuratus: right, got distracted by work, my basic thought is:
    
    (1) what happens up north 1545-1560 can be left blank (after all human historians might not know much about it, although perhaps rumors/minor details of the war that i tentatively invented for Great Library exist)
    
    (2) conclave war timeline is basically settled, as this was largely developed for the chasa river / elderwood arc anyway. it is the conclave war that destroys elven kingdoms and spans shattered ice, etc. 
    
    (3) there are three key events that affect the western hobgoblins, which are currently unknown in nature but have clear impacts:
    - in late 1550s,+/-, something leads hobgoblins to advance south, probably through the tawir forest / mountains gap, starting an advance that is ended by a stalemate with chardon sometime in the late 1550s, perhaps. 
    - there is something that changes the dynamic between mawar and hobgoblins that allows the mawar renaissance to flourish starting in the 1590s
    - there is something that changes the dynamic betwen chardon and the hobgoblins that causes chardon to launch a series of campaigns north, eventually defeating the hobgoblins (exact timing unclear, but shouldn't start before 1600 and shouldn't end after ~1650 or so, most like)
[2025-01-29 05:12 PM] Deciusmus: Right. The 3rd bullet could pretty easily just be "finally strong enough" via the successful Apporia campaign
[2025-01-29 05:13 PM] rsulfuratus: right, that is probably the most straightforward
[2025-01-29 05:13 PM] Deciusmus: I'm envisioning something like the smashing defeat of the Umbral Conventant teaches Chardon it is strong
[2025-01-29 05:14 PM] Deciusmus: and it becomes very popular to start seeing the empire as the savoir of all these scattered people. So the north chardonians, who are after all still (a) alive and (b) Drankorian become this cause that cannot be abandoned
[2025-01-29 05:15 PM] Deciusmus: Details and reasoning honestly doesn't have to be worked out, but it doesn't seem like a hard problem to solve. For the history page I was basically going to write a "Early Imperial Expansion Era" that is basically Apporia + North Chardon coast, 1600-1650, with pretty vague details
[2025-01-29 05:16 PM] rsulfuratus: right, i think there is a nice arc where:
    (a) conclave war nearly results in destruction of chardon and terrifies people
    (b) chardon is isolatist for a while, basically growing up the river but neither a naval or major military power
    (c) umbral convenant / war of the dark rift forces them to rearm, and find they are strong
    (d) after freeing apporia the obvious next step is the hobgoblins
[2025-01-29 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2025-01-29 05:18 PM] Deciusmus: For the Mawar renaissace to really work, you actually want voltara and the north bay coast to be relatively safe by the early 1600s
[2025-01-29 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: i think that tells a nice story about the chardonian empire and the relatively well developed parts of history (chasa river / elderwood / elves; apporia; mawar; north chardon coast), pending the questions about the hobgoblins
[2025-01-29 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: right, that is where I was going next
[2025-01-29 05:19 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. the hobgoblins in the north chardon coast are really the last danger in the area, in  a way
[2025-01-29 05:19 PM] Deciusmus: but you have trade flows like:
![[../_discord_assets/image-6BF59.png]]
[2025-01-29 05:20 PM] rsulfuratus: this picture still leaves the history of the voltara area south through lake valandros northern coast pretty undeveloped (basically, 1, 2, and 5 of the yellow kingdoms)
[2025-01-29 05:20 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-01-29 05:21 PM] rsulfuratus: for lake valandros, i think that the east coast is caught up in the conclave war and was historically probably elven or denoqai anyway, and can be left relatively open-ended
[2025-01-29 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: then imagine the Mindknife War is something from the north, i.e. the two blue arrows pointing at Mawar:
![[../_discord_assets/image-CF136.png]]
[2025-01-29 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: and chardon is busy building a road through the Tawir gap instead of helping
[2025-01-29 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: along that southern blue road
[2025-01-29 05:21 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2025-01-29 05:22 PM] rsulfuratus: the exact dates of the mindknife wars could be adjusted slightly, but this should be into chardon's newly expansionist era where it is starting to look to secure chalyte resoruces
[2025-01-29 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-01-29 05:22 PM] rsulfuratus: it is likely / possible that chardon is fighting some other wars at this point
[2025-01-29 05:23 PM] Deciusmus: you mean against the human kingdoms in voltara region?
[2025-01-29 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: possibly. or whatever is there
[2025-01-29 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: in the Great Library campaign, there is human settlement south of Voltara, and possibly non-Chardonian cities along the coast
[2025-01-29 05:24 PM] rsulfuratus: but there is nothing really north of voltara except orcs, hobgoblins, and kobolds
[2025-01-29 05:24 PM] Deciusmus: Right; those coastal cities work well as the remains of yellow kingdom 5, and a big tradiing partner with mawar during the renaissance
[2025-01-29 05:24 PM] rsulfuratus: the vibe has also been that voltara is a frontier, and that the long road to lake valandros is fairly dangerou
[2025-01-29 05:25 PM] rsulfuratus: the coastal region is probably not part of the chardonian empire at the moment and is likely a non-drankorian culture
[2025-01-29 05:25 PM] rsulfuratus: so they need to survive somehow the early hobgoblins
[2025-01-29 05:25 PM] rsulfuratus: but amani (yellow kingdom 2, on the voltara plains) is completely destroyed
[2025-01-29 05:25 PM] Deciusmus: so here is my northern hobgoblin map
![[../_discord_assets/image-E5CA3.png]]
[2025-01-29 05:26 PM] rsulfuratus: possibly in the non-quite canonical war that chardon doesn't help with
[2025-01-29 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: that outlines I think the 4 options to get hobgoblins to the north chardon coast
[2025-01-29 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: #1 A - split is far north, head west and sail directly south
    #1 B - split is far north, head west, stop on the big island off mawar, then go south
    #2 A and B - similar, but not so far north
    #3 go from voltara area direct
    #4 settle in voltara for a while then go direct
[2025-01-29 05:29 PM] Deciusmus: but really we are saying we need, by say 1600:
![[../_discord_assets/image-0AE08.png]]
[2025-01-29 05:29 PM] Deciusmus: the red region to have been decimated
    the black to be hobgoblins
[2025-01-29 05:30 PM] Deciusmus: the yellow to be a recognizeable human culture with connection back to pre-Great War
[2025-01-29 05:31 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah basically with possibly yellow on north coast of lake valansros too
[2025-01-29 05:31 PM] rsulfuratus: (And with the decimation of elven kingdoms in forests not shown
[2025-01-29 05:31 PM] Deciusmus: I think hobgoblins coming by sea really works better
[2025-01-29 05:32 PM] Deciusmus: if you have the conclave war hobgoblins basically going like:
[2025-01-29 05:33 PM] Deciusmus: or actually
[2025-01-29 05:33 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-B24BD.png]]
[2025-01-29 05:35 PM] Deciusmus: basically make there be 3 strands:
    - west 
    - center
    - east
    
    The center hobgoblins are less enthralled to the dragon Conclave and kinda stop along the way and maybe fight some wars against the humans and settle for a while before being pushed out. But fundamentally Chardon only encounters them as part of the Conclave War (but they are the key enemy in the "unnamed war that destroyed Amini) and also maybe the key group that still exists around the north of voltara/west of fens
[2025-01-29 05:35 PM] Deciusmus: the east hobgoblins are the Conclave true believers and march south
[2025-01-29 05:35 PM] rsulfuratus: I was actually going to propose basically that except the center group does not join conclave war
[2025-01-29 05:36 PM] Deciusmus: the west hobgoblins come to the north coast from the sea, bypassing whatever human settlements there are on the north coast
[2025-01-29 05:36 PM] Deciusmus: right, sure, that works too
[2025-01-29 05:36 PM] rsulfuratus: If you have three hobgoblin strands - revenge/conclave, brutal/violent, and conquerors
[2025-01-29 05:37 PM] rsulfuratus: Then the defeat of the brutal/violent group can potentially be trigger for Mawar renaissance
[2025-01-29 05:38 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-C78E7.png]]
[2025-01-29 05:38 PM] Deciusmus: 1  = conqueors
    2 = brutal/violent
    3 = revenge/conclave
[2025-01-29 05:40 PM] rsulfuratus: Right something like that
[2025-01-29 05:42 PM] Deciusmus: slight tweak:
    
    (making the conquerers on the southwest shore of lake valandros)
![[../_discord_assets/image-7CED8.png]]
[2025-01-29 05:42 PM] Deciusmus: then you have the brutal/violent in the middle and human refugees fleeing in the blue
[2025-01-29 05:43 PM] Deciusmus: not sure what makes the brutal hobgoblins go away but you could end up with 2 or 3 human cultures regrouping after they vanish, and looking to Mawar as the main cultural touchstone in the region
[2025-01-29 05:43 PM] rsulfuratus: A few other considerations: 
    - conquerors here would presumably have a strong navy initially, but this has to disappear for Mawar renaissance to make sense 
    - this puts Mawar in a slightly different light, basically abandoning the light blue people
[2025-01-29 05:44 PM] Deciusmus: One idea: maybe Mawar drops the fog to _lead the fight_ against the brutal/violent hobgoblins
[2025-01-29 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: and are the key people in the coalition that defeats them
[2025-01-29 05:45 PM] rsulfuratus: Hmm. Maybe. Also i think the lake valandros hills are a good place for lots of ruins and such so probably that would imply pushing the light blue southwest and the brutal hobgoblins southeast
[2025-01-29 05:46 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure I like the mawar leading the fighthonestly
[2025-01-29 05:46 PM] rsulfuratus: FWIW this is also supposed to be on the shores of lake valandros: https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/mirror-visions/mace-of-terror-vision/
[2025-01-29 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: But could fit into almost any war
[2025-01-29 05:48 PM] rsulfuratus: I’m not convinced Mawar leading the fight is the right vibe
[2025-01-29 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: yeah me neither
[2025-01-29 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: Two thoughts: nothing has to say Mawar was great allies with the interior northern kingdoms pre Great War. So vibe is maybe less “Mawar abandonded allies” and more “Chardon and Mawar retreated and left the north to fight alone”
[2025-01-29 05:52 PM] rsulfuratus: Second there is kind of a vibe of “everyone do what they need to survive” which makes Mawar again not exactly a hero but also not unusual
[2025-01-29 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: Ok here's a new idea:
![[../_discord_assets/image-11AF6.png]]
[2025-01-29 06:14 PM] Deciusmus: basic idea:
    three hobgoblin strands as discussed.
    
    #1 - conquest strand. arrives by sea. exact route undetermined but they land on the north coast late 1550s +/-
    #2 - death and violence strand. might not be purely hobgoblins, could be orcs? something else? cause of the war which destroyed Amani
    #3 - conclave war strand
[2025-01-29 06:14 PM] Deciusmus: in the early 1550s the #2 and #3 groups wipe out "Yellow Kingdoms" 2 and 3. (4 was already gone due to original cha'mutte armies)
[2025-01-29 06:15 PM] Deciusmus: the #1 strand conqueors most of the post drankorian kingdoms, but has a frozen border with chardon (in south) and active borders with two surviving post-drankor kingdoms in blue
[2025-01-29 06:16 PM] Deciusmus: in the 1590s, something happens that wipes #2 off the map, mostly.
[2025-01-29 06:17 PM] Deciusmus: this makes the destruction up north a little less wholesale - sure "yk 2 and 3" get wiped out by some terrifying whatever but it isn't exactly like there are these endless hobgoblin wars that mawar is staying out of
[2025-01-29 06:18 PM] Deciusmus: Afk for a bit
[2025-01-29 06:19 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm home so dumping a few great library notes here
[2025-01-29 06:21 PM] rsulfuratus: (1) a story told by a bard who lives alone in the mountains north of Voltara (not Chardonian)
    
    Azzan - northlander hero
    Ikos - Chardonian friend
    Fought together in the Great War against Cha'mutte, great friends. But soon after the war, in the chaos as the hobgoblins poured from the north, Chardon abandoned the Northlanders, seeking to protect their borders. Despite Ikos' pleas, Chardon did not come to their aid and many died. Now, Chardon has come back but in front of an Empire, instead of allies. 
    
    (could be metaphor / retconned)
[2025-01-29 06:30 PM] rsulfuratus: (2) handouts from very early in the great library campaign, no need to be canonical
![[../_discord_assets/image-308B8.png]]
[2025-01-29 06:30 PM] rsulfuratus: which reminds me, another consideration: there is a big dwarven ruins underneath the mountains separating voltara from the coast, but no dwarves
[2025-01-29 06:31 PM] rsulfuratus: so these were presumably destroyed during whatever wiped out amani
[2025-01-29 06:45 PM] rsulfuratus: here is a rough outline of current west coast vibes
![[../_discord_assets/west-coast-current-51F34.jpg]]
[2025-01-29 06:47 PM] rsulfuratus: red (D) = ruins of pre-Great War dwarves
    red (E) = ruins of pre-Great War elves
    pinkish = desolation / orcs / hobgoblins / whatever (no civilizations)
    blue = thriving non-Chardonian cultures
    green = "core" of Chardonian Empire, mostly quite loyal
    light blue = "frontier" of the Chardonian Empire. Voltara very much a garrison town with a fractious local population; lake valandros coast less clear what it is
    black = ?????
[2025-01-29 06:47 PM] rsulfuratus: light purple = Deno'qai
[2025-01-29 06:49 PM] rsulfuratus: other details:
    - Chardon's conquest of Voltara is not a war against a strong, organized kingdom. my headcannon has always been kind of like conquering beorinlings or something
    - it is entirely possible the reason why Voltara feels like a frontier is some of the light blue area is hobgoblins / empty / dangerous; or, some of the light blue area is people who don't like chardon. but it is not densely settled
[2025-01-29 06:50 PM] rsulfuratus: - blue areas are not in active conflict with Chardon; to the extent Chardon has been recently expansionist it is south (to Illoria) and east (into forests / Deno'qai)
[2025-01-29 06:50 PM] rsulfuratus: - history should provide reasons why green areas generally feel loyal and happy (this is already mostly accomplished)
[2025-01-29 06:50 PM] rsulfuratus: - Yeraad really needs some thought
[2025-01-29 07:17 PM] Deciusmus: Right so if you take my 1560 map, it maps pretty nicely onto your "current" map
[2025-01-29 07:20 PM] Deciusmus: Basically the story goes something like....
    
    On the eve of the Great War you have 
    - "yellow kingdoms 1 - 5"
    - mawar
    - "post drankor kingdoms A, B, C, etc"
    
    in particular you have a bunch of related minor kingdoms (call them A, B, C, D, and E) along the coast, as well as a fairly important post-Drankorian kingdom F in the Nahadi river valley
[2025-01-29 07:20 PM] Deciusmus: F is pretty closely aligned with Chardon
[2025-01-29 07:21 PM] Deciusmus: then there are one or more scattered frontier provinces along the borders
[2025-01-29 07:21 PM] Deciusmus: (Tawir Forest and north shore of lake valandros)
[2025-01-29 07:22 PM] Deciusmus: When the Great War + Conclave War comes, yellow kingdoms 3 + 4 are completely wiped out.
[2025-01-29 07:23 PM] Deciusmus: as are whatever post-Drankorian realms are up the Chasa River valley (Kin-Asa, etc)
[2025-01-29 07:25 PM] Deciusmus: then "something bad" comes out of the cha'mutte army, not the conclave dragons, but something else. Could be a violent bunch of hobgoblins, could be orcs, could be a random mix of stuff. They break "yellow kingdom 2" (Amani) and whatever dwarven kingdom is in the mountains there, to the extent it has survived the great war
[2025-01-29 07:25 PM] Deciusmus: this "something bad" is the source of all of the vague rumors in the Great Library game, and it doesn't have to be super canonical exactly what it is
[2025-01-29 07:26 PM] Deciusmus: separately, the "conquest" hobgoblins land on the north coast
[2025-01-29 07:32 PM] rsulfuratus: right, so i think the basic idea works well
[2025-01-29 07:32 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the idea of a hobgobin armada conquering the north coast probably needs a bit of magical help, but the basic logic works fine
[2025-01-29 07:33 PM] rsulfuratus: ^specifically because it might take too long for hobgoblins to really settle here otherwise, but maybe not
[2025-01-29 07:34 PM] rsulfuratus: the basic idea of the area stretching from north valandros coast to voltara is left relatively undeveloped but there is some bad thing here that causes destruction but is eventually defeated
[2025-01-29 07:35 PM] rsulfuratus: mawar renaissance in this history becomes a bit of a broader northern renaissance, basically a flourishing in the north while chardon is still bearing the brunt of the north coast hobgoblins or something (since the north is safe sooner than chardon is safe)
[2025-01-29 07:35 PM] rsulfuratus: still some unanswered questions but this seems like a solid framework
[2025-01-29 07:40 PM] Deciusmus: right so then in say 1560 or 1575 you have something like this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-7340E.png]]
[2025-01-29 07:41 PM] Deciusmus: the blue "6" is the old post drankor F an largely survives to join chardon - i.e. after the conclave war some type of "mutual defense" alliance becomes a province or whatever. makes this "near Nahadi" a very early part of the empire like the chasa, not sure how that fits with your modern day vibes
[2025-01-29 07:41 PM] rsulfuratus: That’s consistent, south valandros is “green”
[2025-01-29 07:42 PM] rsulfuratus: Ie happy to be part of the empire
[2025-01-29 07:42 PM] Deciusmus: the middle two blue kingdoms could in theory just get crushed by the bad things on their borders. or they could survive to form the basis of whatever chardon later conqueors during the voltara conquests. either way, not too many people here really. these are lightly populated "refugee" lands, not proper surviving kingdoms
[2025-01-29 07:42 PM] Deciusmus: the north two blue kingdoms (mawar and the other one) form the basis of the northern renaissance
[2025-01-29 07:42 PM] Deciusmus: and survive to modern day intact from pre-great war
[2025-01-29 07:43 PM] Deciusmus: big unknowns are:
    - how did so many hobgoblins appear on the coast in late 1550s
    - what was the big scary in the middle volatara region and what killed it (presumably it going away triggers the Mawar renaissnace/end of mawar hiding)
[2025-01-29 07:44 PM] Deciusmus: and to a lesser extent:
    - who were the "middle blue" kingdoms on the northwest and northeast of valandros, and what happened to them during the northern renaissance? (only real canonical fact is that they can't get wealthy and prosperous enough to be major competitors to chardon in the 1670s/80s when voltara is being conquered)
[2025-01-29 07:47 PM] rsulfuratus: right. to a certain extent none of those need to be addressed to write a "grand sweep of history on the west coast" page
[2025-01-29 07:48 PM] rsulfuratus: there are a few other minor details (who/what lives in Tawir forest?)
[2025-01-29 07:48 PM] rsulfuratus: but again nothing immediately in need of addressing
[2025-01-29 07:49 PM] Deciusmus: agreed
[2025-01-29 07:49 PM] rsulfuratus: i think brainstorming yeraad is more critical to getting the final layout of the west coast done in broad strokes than filling the remaiing holes to the north
[2025-01-29 07:49 PM] rsulfuratus: the problem with yeraad is it is canonically quite safe during the blood years
[2025-01-29 07:50 PM] rsulfuratus: chardon never feels pressure on its southeastern borders; darba/songara is the safest part of dunmar
[2025-01-29 07:50 PM] rsulfuratus: illoria is a pirate kingdom but not immediately threatened by cha'mutte related dangers or other great evils
[2025-01-29 07:50 PM] Deciusmus: right. that whole area has to be safe enough that the pirate kings of Castrella can make a living off trade through the canal
[2025-01-29 07:51 PM] rsulfuratus: illoria is barely touched by the great war, which is in part how the end up controlling darba and large parts of apporia in the immediate aftermath
[2025-01-29 07:51 PM] Deciusmus: although presumably there is some disruption from the massive shocks of a huge mountain range appearing to the east?
[2025-01-29 07:52 PM] Deciusmus: although I guess there doens't have to be  - darba isn't destroyed or damaged
[2025-01-29 07:52 PM] rsulfuratus: i've never tried to square that circle. just handwave "its magic"
[2025-01-29 07:52 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2025-01-29 07:53 PM] rsulfuratus: there is actually an argument that the yuvanti mountains are raised by the baharzel as a refuge for the dwarves fleeing ardith
[2025-01-29 07:53 PM] Deciusmus: is there any reason there has to be a lot of people in yeraad? maybe its just lizardfolk
[2025-01-29 07:53 PM] rsulfuratus: mostly just it is safe land and presumably a pretty good climate
[2025-01-29 07:54 PM] Deciusmus: right I guess safe farmland is in scare supply
[2025-01-29 07:54 PM] Deciusmus: and would be unlikely to be left fallow
[2025-01-29 07:54 PM] Deciusmus: what's it like in modern day?
[2025-01-29 07:54 PM] rsulfuratus: i think myraeni gap and the hilly region between the elderwood and the sentinels is lightly peopled and can be left as a obvious question mark
[2025-01-29 07:54 PM] rsulfuratus: yeraad in modern day is undetermined
[2025-01-29 07:54 PM] rsulfuratus: although under chardonian control since they happily marched many legions through there
[2025-01-29 07:55 PM] Deciusmus: its at a somewhat complicated geographic region
[2025-01-29 07:55 PM] Deciusmus: as it implicates the whole illorian area/nevos sea/emerald coast
[2025-01-29 07:56 PM] rsulfuratus: in the modern day the area northeast of the chardon road is kobolds / ??? / scrubland / lightly peopled and fine to be ???
[2025-01-29 07:56 PM] rsulfuratus: but the rest is in need of something clearer to put there
[2025-01-29 07:56 PM] rsulfuratus: basically, originally this was just "core chardon empire" but that makes the core chardon empire too big in my opinion
[2025-01-29 07:58 PM] rsulfuratus: in high school is was basically "core chardon"
![[../_discord_assets/image-FCCEB.png]]
[2025-01-29 07:59 PM] rsulfuratus: but the swamps and rivers got moved around and this area got stretched in the current map
[2025-01-29 07:59 PM] rsulfuratus: so the center of gravity of chardon shifted north
[2025-01-29 08:01 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-01-29 08:01 PM] Deciusmus: so on the map there are a lot of cities and roads here
[2025-01-29 08:02 PM] Deciusmus: but also it feels a bit separated from the coast
[2025-01-29 08:02 PM] rsulfuratus: there are really 2 cities. i'd consider anything northwest of the "south chardon hills" to be "core chardon/chasa" not yeraad
[2025-01-29 08:03 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess 3 cities - one is in the hills
[2025-01-29 08:03 PM] Deciusmus: so from the map I'd guess the denset population is the yellow:
![[../_discord_assets/image-45456.png]]
[2025-01-29 08:03 PM] Deciusmus: but not sure if that is right
[2025-01-29 08:04 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i think that is close. the coast is imaged to be swampy with a big delta
[2025-01-29 08:04 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure how far it extends so maybe some settlement around the mountains on the coast
[2025-01-29 08:05 PM] rsulfuratus: most of the mountains are imagined to closely approach the ocean so you get cliffs and not a lot of settlement. and also maybe  giants or something that keep people from venturing too much
[2025-01-29 08:05 PM] rsulfuratus: in any case for whatever reason those mountains are supposed to be pretty uninhabited
[2025-01-29 08:05 PM] rsulfuratus: but you definitely have people on the north slopes
[2025-01-29 08:05 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is useful for the yeraad to be culturally pretty disconnected from the nevos
[2025-01-29 08:06 PM] rsulfuratus: the mouth of the yeraad i've always imagined kind of like the mississipi delta
[2025-01-29 08:07 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-01-29 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: it's about 3 degrees further north
[2025-01-29 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: and somewhat drier overall
[2025-01-29 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: but not too different
[2025-01-29 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: the interior is maybe a bit like texas hill country
[2025-01-29 08:07 PM] Deciusmus: but you could imagine it as pretty heavily populated with lizardfolk
[2025-01-29 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-01-29 08:09 PM] rsulfuratus: if anyone lives between delta and mountains it is probably small illorian colonies, that type of thing. and the area with the windmill on the map is basically "core chardon", if undeveloped in detail
[2025-01-29 08:10 PM] rsulfuratus: so it is really the interior area south of river, north of moutains, along the road connecting the two major cities that needs development
[2025-01-29 08:10 PM] rsulfuratus: and this feels like it should have a pretty different culture / vibe than core chardon
[2025-01-29 08:11 PM] rsulfuratus: but what is not clear,  nor is how they came to be chardonian
[2025-01-29 08:11 PM] rsulfuratus: the one city is kind of placed as a mining town, although chardon mostly gets metals from lake valanadros hills, which are closer and have river transport
[2025-01-29 08:12 PM] Deciusmus: so you have something like this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-8B5D3.png]]
[2025-01-29 08:12 PM] Deciusmus: where pink is illorian
[2025-01-29 08:12 PM] Deciusmus: red is danger/no people
[2025-01-29 08:12 PM] Deciusmus: blue is lizardfolk
[2025-01-29 08:12 PM] Deciusmus: yellow is core chardon
[2025-01-29 08:12 PM] Deciusmus: green is "yeraad river"
[2025-01-29 08:13 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. maybe curving up a bit between the major swamps on the yeraad, but the basic outline is correct
[2025-01-29 08:15 PM] Deciusmus: So from a historical perspective, this would have been ?? ->` drankorian ->` some kind of post-drankor state ->` relatively safe in great war / blood years ->` somehow part of chardon
[2025-01-29 08:15 PM] Deciusmus: in the ?? period it would have been largely on the drankorian borderlands for a fairly long time
[2025-01-29 08:16 PM] Deciusmus: although perhaps not meaningfully so if the songra area was unpeopled and drankor was focused on the nevos sea/darba
[2025-01-29 08:16 PM] rsulfuratus: right. at one point i had the idea that somewhat whatever was here actually triggered the western wars somehow. e.g. maybe got taken over by something evil or ???
[2025-01-29 08:16 PM] rsulfuratus: but darba was a bigger border and songara wasn't founded
[2025-01-29 08:17 PM] rsulfuratus: so maybe not a super dense or high traffic border
[2025-01-29 08:17 PM] rsulfuratus: the myraeni gap is a natural barrier
[2025-01-29 08:17 PM] rsulfuratus: so there would be contact but maybe not a lot of contact
[2025-01-29 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: It feels like a good place for a kinda insular culture. Happy to have a sovereign overlord but kinda do their own thing
[2025-01-29 08:20 PM] rsulfuratus: right. its also fairly big (300 miles by 200 miles, roughly) and doesn't need to be just one thing
[2025-01-29 08:21 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2025-01-29 08:22 PM] Deciusmus: What’s the climate like?
[2025-01-29 08:23 PM] rsulfuratus: the myraeni gap is very much texas hill country
[2025-01-29 08:23 PM] rsulfuratus: but the rest of the valley is probably not quite that dry
[2025-01-29 08:24 PM] rsulfuratus: i could see the wedge between the two eastern tributaries as being pretty much texas hill country
[2025-01-29 08:25 PM] rsulfuratus: the northeast part along the elderwood is clearly wetter and is maybe the most densely populated
[2025-01-29 08:26 PM] rsulfuratus: the whole area is marked Csa
[2025-01-29 08:26 PM] rsulfuratus: Chardon is supposed to have a kind of san francisco climate vibe
[2025-01-29 08:27 PM] rsulfuratus: spain and greece and parts of italy also work
[2025-01-29 08:28 PM] rsulfuratus: the summer high pressure shifts over the yeraad to allows the monsoons, so this is definitely a dry summer, wet winter area
[2025-01-29 08:28 PM] rsulfuratus: but warm enough for year round growing - basically california
[2025-01-29 08:30 PM] Deciusmus: Right. But with slightly different mountain structure.
[2025-01-29 08:31 PM] rsulfuratus: Right running perpendicular instead of parallel to coast
[2025-01-29 08:32 PM] rsulfuratus: I’m kind of thinking the right vibe might actually several small fragmented cultures without much cultural or political cohesion
[2025-01-29 08:32 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I was kinda thinking the same
[2025-01-29 08:34 PM] Deciusmus: If you play with the geographic a little bit you could have 3-4 pretty separate regions, ie maybe the land between the two rivers is kinda higher and you have a cattle culture in the hill lands between the rivers
[2025-01-29 08:35 PM] Deciusmus: Then the section north of the yeraad along south of the hills is wetter and more agricultural
[2025-01-29 08:37 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-E7CEE.png]]
[2025-01-29 08:38 PM] rsulfuratus: something like:
    (1) agricultural, maybe olive growing
    (2) dry rocky hills, cattle ranching
    (3) ?? - highlands? not sure, imaging the eastern river here is rapid and non-navigable
    (4) river valley culture
[2025-01-29 08:38 PM] rsulfuratus: but the exact borders could shift a bit
[2025-01-29 08:38 PM] rsulfuratus: with 1 and northern part of 2 densest settlement
[2025-01-29 08:39 PM] rsulfuratus: alternatively 3 could be perfectly logical place for non-humans
[2025-01-29 08:40 PM] rsulfuratus: although who is not clear
[2025-01-29 08:41 PM] rsulfuratus: i think:
    (2) is dusty roads, and only nominally controlled by chardon. basically, they staff forts along the roads. maybe charge tribute in the form of some kind of tax. but culturally this really isn't chardonian
[2025-01-29 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: and culturally may be distinct from 1/3/4 too
[2025-01-29 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: this could be "myraeni" / a more pure "original northerner" culture
[2025-01-29 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: although probably worshipping mos numena
[2025-01-29 08:43 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I like that. Maybe the tax is more of a “protection” thing as well, ie the northern borders are not that safe
[2025-01-29 08:43 PM] rsulfuratus: right, sure
[2025-01-29 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: So kinda a happy to pay situation because Chardons a pretty competent overlord and is not that interested in forcing local politics to change
[2025-01-29 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: So the legions and such are pretty welcomed ie when they are marching to Dunmar
[2025-01-29 08:45 PM] rsulfuratus: right. canonically there was a lot of trouble with kobold raiders here
[2025-01-29 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: Not really questioned or a problem. Maybe lots of poorer folks here join the army even
[2025-01-29 08:46 PM] rsulfuratus: and actually the vibe was always "chardon doesn't pay enough attention to our problems"
[2025-01-29 08:47 PM] rsulfuratus: i think (1) is likely fairly well integrated into chardon. this maybe has a similar story to Raziolo, the further west province in apporia
[2025-01-29 08:49 PM] rsulfuratus: but culturally maybe distinct from (2). perhaps more drankorian, perhaps more culturally chardonian. maybe a substantial population of refugees from chasa river from conclave war who fled and never returned (Kin-Aska was completely destroyed, for example)
[2025-01-29 08:50 PM] rsulfuratus: probably don't need much detail here, although eventually want names and more history, for the broad sweep post-Great War these are integrated peacefully during the period of consolidation and expansion between 1600 - 1640 roughly
[2025-01-29 08:50 PM] Deciusmus: Wouldn’t refugees just flee toward Chardon?
[2025-01-29 08:50 PM] rsulfuratus: the conclave armies got within ~50 miles of chardon
[2025-01-29 08:51 PM] rsulfuratus: (1) is both ~75 miles closer to Kin-Aska and crucially south of the path of the invading army, which is clearly heading to chardon
[2025-01-29 08:52 PM] rsulfuratus: but the details don't really matter
[2025-01-29 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2025-01-29 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: Either way the main idea would be that yeraad is a somewhat culturally unique area largely supportive of Chardonian rule but not really Chardonian culturally
[2025-01-29 08:55 PM] rsulfuratus: well, i would say (1) and (2) on my map, yes. (3) and (4) maybe not
[2025-01-29 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i kind of wonder if there is another chalyte source in the south mountains and that is the purpose of the city in (3)
[2025-01-29 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: although would have to have problems for some reason or it wouldn't be worthwhile to go all the way north to voltara
[2025-01-29 08:57 PM] Deciusmus: What if there are giants
[2025-01-29 08:57 PM] Deciusmus: Who don’t really want Chardon to take the chaylte
[2025-01-29 08:59 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, that could work. i'm not totally ready to commit to a specific idea especially involving chalyte as this may be quite relevant to the coming chardonian upheavals
[2025-01-29 08:59 PM] Deciusmus: Right.
[2025-01-29 09:00 PM] rsulfuratus: but i think the basic vibe of (3) being "something that is complicated by some complicated factor potentially involving giants or something" is sensible
[2025-01-29 09:00 PM] rsulfuratus: this area probably was conquered during the later expansionist phase for ~reasons~
[2025-01-29 09:00 PM] Deciusmus: Right. Doesn’t even have to be chaylte
[2025-01-29 09:01 PM] Deciusmus: Could also be an area that was mysteriously empty after the Great War.
[2025-01-29 09:01 PM] Deciusmus: Say, no one really knows what happened to the people.
[2025-01-29 09:02 PM] Deciusmus: I dunno. The vibes work
[2025-01-29 09:02 PM] Deciusmus: The details don’t really matter
[2025-01-29 09:03 PM] rsulfuratus: Right
[2025-01-29 09:04 PM] rsulfuratus: Then maybe 4 is just lightly populated? I’m not sure the (4) vibes
[2025-01-29 09:05 PM] Deciusmus: I think the lizardfolk have something to do with (4) vibes
[2025-01-29 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah that seems right
[2025-01-29 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: Maybe that region is not even part of the chardonian empire
[2025-01-29 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah actually that’s intent
[2025-01-29 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: Interesting
[2025-01-29 09:11 PM] Deciusmus: (3) has not a lot of people but something Chardon wants. Which motivates the peaceful absorption of (1) and (2) and least in part
[2025-01-29 09:11 PM] Deciusmus: (3) doesn’t go well for ~reasons~ so it becomes kind of a lightly settled borderland, but plenty of people moved there or whatever so it isn’t empty
[2025-01-29 09:12 PM] Deciusmus: But (1) and especially (2) are the places with long interesting histories
[2025-01-29 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: Then there is something in 4, in between the red danger separating it from the coast and the oddities of (3), but it’s intentionally blank for now. But not part of Chardon and maybe not even drankoiran
[2025-01-29 09:19 PM] rsulfuratus: (4) might have an interesting history, just an insular one
[2025-01-29 09:19 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2025-01-29 09:36 PM] Deciusmus: Ok I’m going to try to write up some of the non-yeraad stuff over tomorrow/Friday/Saturday
[2025-01-29 09:38 PM] Deciusmus: Basic canonical points:
    - hobgoblins by sea to north Chardon 
    - “bad thing” central attack on voltara 
    - conclave war
    - end of bad thing is start of Mawar renaissance 
    
    Non-canonical:
    - what the bad thing was and how it ended 
    - what happened to the hobgoblins on north Chardon as they were defeated
[2025-01-29 09:39 PM] Deciusmus: Canonical:
    - some kind of south valandros kingdom that is absorbed into Chardon
    - north east and north west valandros lightly populated
    - non drankorian realm on north bay coast
    Non canocial:
    - any details of the middle and north places (might make up some details on the place that is now part of Chardon heartland)
[2025-01-29 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: `[]`
[2025-01-29 09:42 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, sounds reasonable. i may have some more comments / thoughts when it is all written out but am trying to finish the cosmology project asap so i can push a new taelgarverse saturday, and need to switch to session prep, so might not have time to do much more of this for a bit
[2025-01-29 09:42 PM] Deciusmus: Sure
[2025-01-29 09:53 PM] rsulfuratus: i pushed my chasa river valley notes from onenote to brainstorming. mostly you didn't spend any time in cities so much of this kind of passed in a blur in the background and doesn't need to be strictly canonical
[2025-01-29 09:53 PM] rsulfuratus: but generally speaking should be without good reason to deviate
[2025-01-29 10:08 PM] Deciusmus: A couple of name ideas 
    Veneros
    Tarquina
    Valandria (intentionally similar to Valandros)
    Nemora (or Nemoris)
    Vescarum
    Marcenium
    Oscandria
    Yeraetium
[2025-01-29 10:09 PM] Deciusmus: Vastarno
[2025-01-29 10:09 PM] Deciusmus: Neracium
[2025-01-29 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: Lupentia
[2025-01-29 10:15 PM] Deciusmus: If you get a chance to flag any you particularly like/don’t let me know. I’ll tag everything name check anyway
[2025-01-29 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus: These are towns/cities? I haven’t settled on solid naming conventions around Chardon. I think generally “Roman-ish” is fine although I’ve often trended more Italian in places (eg apporia). Lots of places in the north would potentially be akin to latinized Arabic or other Semitic names
[2025-01-29 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus: I forget what I used for kin-aska, I may have been thinking kind of Deno’qai northern
[2025-01-29 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus: Rivers have tended to be Semitic / Northros, but not always
[2025-01-29 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus: Voltara area naming is a mess and mostly not canonical but tends Italian which I’m not sure is correct
[2025-01-29 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus: Volganis and Amani are based on high school names so no linguistic derivation
[2025-01-29 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: That said, I like Nemoris, Tarquina, Oscandria. Could be lots of Valandros-related names, plausibly, but generallly for old drankorian things
[2025-01-29 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: Lupentia is good too
[2025-01-29 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus: Don’t really like Veneros
[2025-01-29 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: These are mostly for provinces or other regions. Probably not rivers
[2025-01-29 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: Possibly for sites of battles or whatever
[2025-01-29 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: Primarily post-Drankorian not up north stuff
[2025-01-29 10:34 PM] Deciusmus: What about 
    Mizranis
    Rafida
    Darajum 
    Kasira
    Badirum
    Qamira
    Wassid or Wassidi
    
    As river names?
[2025-01-29 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus: I like Rafida and Qamira, which I would probably “chardonize” to Kamir or something
[2025-01-29 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus: I think there is also nothing wrong with a few “Green River” or “Rushing River” type names
[2025-01-29 10:41 PM] Deciusmus: For the north coast region in general…
    
    Lirae Verdinum 
    Litus Aureum
    Caledria
    
    Arabic/northros
    Bahrica
    Yasir 
    Rimila
[2025-01-29 10:41 PM] Deciusmus: Not sure I like any of them
[2025-01-29 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: Alternatively something like 
    The Green Coast
    The Fertile Coast
    The Gold Coast
[2025-01-29 10:42 PM] Deciusmus: Anyway going to bed
