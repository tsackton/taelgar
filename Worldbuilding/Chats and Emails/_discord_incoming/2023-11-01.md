# Discord DM – 2023-11-01

[2023-11-01 10:09 AM] Deciusmus: I added a "Primary Sources" folder to dump in-world written documents that are more historical than campaign specific
[2023-11-01 11:32 AM] Deciusmus: I like the species changes, nice org.
    
    One suggestion, maybe move the languages stuff to its own note?
    
    It often comes up as relevant outside the context of creating a character
[2023-11-01 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus: yes, I have that in an uncommited change. I just am not sure where to put it so it is lingering in my top-level directory. maybe in species?
[2023-11-01 11:33 AM] Deciusmus: I think species is a good place
[2023-11-01 11:34 AM] Deciusmus: I also wonder if the Character Creation Guide should be under Campaigns.
    
    I don't use the same house rules in my game, for example, as you do. If I ever wanted to include a link to my house rules, I'd rather it be either in my main or in my Campaigns folder
[2023-11-01 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah that probably makes sense
[2023-11-01 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus: I was starting to make a bunch of "Playing a X" docs which are a bit more ambigious
[2023-11-01 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus: as well
[2023-11-01 11:36 AM] Deciusmus: I have so far not diverged from you in the game mechanics of a species
[2023-11-01 11:36 AM] Deciusmus: and am less likely to
[2023-11-01 11:36 AM] Deciusmus: I think those might be good where they are
[2023-11-01 11:37 AM] Deciusmus: Although...
    
    Maybe it would be better to
    (a) move the "flavor" bits to the main XXX doc
    (b) Make a Species\Rules or Species\Mechanics folder for the game rules
[2023-11-01 11:40 AM] Deciusmus: i.e. in dwarves...
    
    The Playing a Dwarf document has some duplicative introductory material, and the section on Names and Lifespan is maybe better placed in the Dwarves document (or maybe a separate Dwarven Names doc)
[2023-11-01 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus: my goal with the "Playing an X" was to allow the main species lore documents to grow fairly large and complex, but still have a place for a quick introduction to the vibe of a species in taelgar
[2023-11-01 11:41 AM] Deciusmus: That does make sense
[2023-11-01 11:42 AM] Deciusmus: My instinct is just to try to disentangle lore and mechanics as much as possible
[2023-11-01 11:42 AM] Deciusmus: Maybe a different way of putting it would be that useful lore about a specieis should not be ONLY in the Playing a XX note
[2023-11-01 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus: yes, I agree with that
[2023-11-01 11:49 AM] Deciusmus: I guess the main actionable suggestions I'd make would be:
    
    1) Split out life cycle and names to their own docs and/or make sure they are mentioned in the lore somewhere. It is very handy to have an easy place to look for naming of non-humans.
    
    2) Move the Playing a XXX to a Specise\Rules or Species\Mechanics rather than having them under each species. That helps if, for example, I want to publish the species lore to my Taelgarverse site but don't want to include the playing a XX, or alternatively, want to make my own with my own house rules
[2023-11-01 11:50 AM] Deciusmus: (i.e. I could have a Species\Game Rules that I .gitignore and then write my own versions there and publish that instead of the 'main' copy)
[2023-11-01 11:51 AM] Deciusmus: This is all a bit academic, because I am very unlikely to bother as I don't anticipiate running anything in Taelgar that isn't my current group for a long time, and they all have characters and are mostly human
[2023-11-01 11:52 AM] Deciusmus: And if I decide to tweak my one dwarves abilities I'll almost certainly just do it on D&D beyond by making my own homebrew version
[2023-11-01 11:53 AM] Deciusmus: (I assume your inspiration is this idea of a mini-campaign with some new people)
[2023-11-01 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus: Yeah I think that makes sense
[2023-11-01 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus: I might try a bit of reorg later today
[2023-11-01 12:03 PM] Deciusmus: BTW the folder depth in sembara is kinda annoying. Any objection to making Eastern Green Sea and Western Green Sea top level under Gazetteer?
[2023-11-01 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus: nope
[2023-11-01 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus: is there a clear reason why we don't sync the stuff in the Campaigns folder? it does not seem like it should conflict, and we both already have rules to ignore certain parts of the folder structure for website building
[2023-11-01 12:12 PM] Deciusmus: no reason
[2023-11-01 12:12 PM] Deciusmus: I'd be happy to sync it
[2023-11-01 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus: I am thinking of moving the Playing an X stuff to Campaigns/Mechanics
[2023-11-01 12:13 PM] Deciusmus: that sounds sensible
[2023-11-01 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus: you could just leave it unpublished
[2023-11-01 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm also putting the Player's Guide in the top-level of the Campaigns directory
[2023-11-01 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus: the species_reorg branch will remove Campaigns from .gitignore, when I'm ready to PR I'll rebase against the updates you've done to main
[2023-11-01 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm also revisiting organization of "Things"
[2023-11-01 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus: thinking of putting the "Treasure from XXX" stuff that is basically just a bunch of notes on items you've found in Dunmari Campaign / Treasure
[2023-11-01 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus: leaving only Ships, Materials, Books, and Artifacts of Power in Things
[2023-11-01 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus: Books and Materials seem very plausible to share across campaigns - no reason you shouldn't have [[inkaye]] in your campaign if you want it
[2023-11-01 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus: or the elven poet Nelawe in your game as well
[2023-11-01 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus: (Lyrics of a New Age)
[2023-11-01 12:38 PM] Deciusmus: I like that
[2023-11-01 12:45 PM] Deciusmus: I moved my small number of things to Campaigns already, so with the changed gitignore should work fine
[2023-11-01 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus: did you already push change that changes gazetteer top level structure?
[2023-11-01 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus: that might theoretically break a lot of links
[2023-11-01 12:54 PM] Deciusmus: I did
[2023-11-01 12:54 PM] Deciusmus: it won't break obsidian internal links, I checked
[2023-11-01 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: It could break external links
[2023-11-01 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: that doesn't matter though, as those will all get regenerated next time I build the website
[2023-11-01 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-11-01 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus: might break links from party treasure google doc but I have a script to rebuild that as well so doesn't matter there either
[2023-11-01 12:56 PM] Deciusmus: wait let me check I might not have pushed
[2023-11-01 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: I committed but I cant remember if I pushed
[2023-11-01 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus: you did I already pulled the latest and it is there
[2023-11-01 01:01 PM] Deciusmus: On the Gazetter, where do you think Insingue and similar places should be? they are in Western Green Sea but I'm not sure that is correct
[2023-11-01 01:02 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe western green sea is fine..
[2023-11-01 01:05 PM] rsulfuratus: the whole plaguelands / isingue / orenlas / aurbez are a big orphaned
[2023-11-01 01:06 PM] rsulfuratus: they aren't really green sea oriented but they also aren't "central lowlands" really
[2023-11-01 01:08 PM] rsulfuratus: actually looking at my big map of regions I think western green is basically fine
[2023-11-01 01:08 PM] rsulfuratus: culturally and historically they are part of the sembaran orbit
[2023-11-01 01:09 PM] rsulfuratus: going to merge PR that commits the big reorg now, unless you want to review at all
[2023-11-01 01:15 PM] Deciusmus: No merge it
[2023-11-01 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: how about DR = drankorian reckoning, CY = (dwarven) count of years
[2023-11-01 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: I created a PR to do some further Gazetter reorg. https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/pull/4
    
    See PR comments for rationale
[2023-11-01 02:46 PM] rsulfuratus: I think this makes sense, the gazeteer is getting unwieldy and needs standardization
[2023-11-01 02:47 PM] rsulfuratus: I also realized scrolling through that with treasure for dunmar campaign in github repo you can pick which things to look at in the mirror based on which have secrets
[2023-11-01 02:52 PM] Deciusmus: ha
[2023-11-01 02:53 PM] Deciusmus: I was going to ask you what the secret was on my old shield that is now gone 😄
[2023-11-01 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: It is definitely Dunmari in design, and the insignia, a stylized head of a rearing horse in front of two crossed spears, dates it to the Dunmari army during the great war. This was probably an officer's shield as the craftsmanship is extraordinary. Alesh thinks it must have been in someone's family for a while, kept and maintained as an heirloom, before [[Agata]] acquired it, as it would not be in this good shape had it been just abandoned somewhere for 200 years. But it could also be something like a trophy [[Agata]] took from someone she killed that she maintained as a form of gloating or remembrance of her victories. Or even something that was lost in a dry, buried location somehow protected from rust and decay
[2023-11-01 02:55 PM] rsulfuratus: I think actually this is all stuff you learned in game at one point from the smith in Karawa and/or Alesh. or maybe it was stuff I thought you'd ask about
[2023-11-01 02:55 PM] Deciusmus: I will say having all the campaign stuff in git is nice when I do a re-org like rename "River Volta" to "Volta" because it means the links don't break
[2023-11-01 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-11-01 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: the best secret that needs to be rewritten now with your work on the hobgoblin wars is the Pearl of Power:
    "(need to check history with updates from Sembaran guide)
    Recovered from the belly of the roper killed in the dwarven outpost near Raven's Hold. This was originally the creation of a wizard of the lands north of Chardon, from before the Great War. It was lost to hobgoblins during the Blood Years, and then traded and stolen among different hobgoblin tribes, until it ended up in the hands of the hobgoblins and allies on the eastern side of the mountains who fought against Sembara in the Hobgoblin Wars in the 1570s. From here, it passed to a series of Sembaran adventurers, mostly priests, until it ended up in the hands of an adventurer killed by wild monsters in the northern part of the Plaguelands. Here is was lost for some time, until in the early 1700s, when it was found again by explorers from the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez, and eventually passed into the hands of a traveling sorcerer in 1742, heading south to explore rumors of evil on the southern mountain border of Aurbez. He found his way to Raven's Hold, where he was trapped, killed, and consumed by the roper."
[2023-11-01 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: Some history is in "History" others in long articles in the Gazetteer
[2023-11-01 03:20 PM] Deciusmus: Does it make sense to keep both? Does one make more sense than the other?
[2023-11-01 03:21 PM] rsulfuratus: I think it makes more sense to just link to history in the History directory as needed
[2023-11-01 03:21 PM] rsulfuratus: keep gazetteer to relatively current-day stuff
[2023-11-01 03:21 PM] rsulfuratus: I think some little details like "In 1720, blah blah blah"
[2023-11-01 03:21 PM] rsulfuratus: stay in gazettteer
[2023-11-01 03:22 PM] Deciusmus: So for example the long "History" section in Tollen moves to History?
[2023-11-01 03:23 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that should move to history I think
[2023-11-01 03:26 PM] Deciusmus: Where would you put something like a 800-1000 word history of the town of Cleenseau?
[2023-11-01 03:29 PM] rsulfuratus: I am not sure if embedding notes works for the html conversion. if it does, I'd put that as a note in the history directory and then just embedd the contents in the Cleenseau note
[2023-11-01 03:30 PM] rsulfuratus: if note embedding breaks in the html conversion, I'd probably leave short history stuff in the gazettteer and just move stuff out once the history gets past some arbitrary length
[2023-11-01 03:30 PM] Deciusmus: Honestly, I find navigating around via links fine, and prefer just linking.
[2023-11-01 03:30 PM] rsulfuratus: that's fine too
[2023-11-01 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: I found when writing the Sembaran stuff that dense linking worked best
[2023-11-01 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: I don't think we need to have strict rules but in general history should be in history and linked to gazetteer as needed for context
[2023-11-01 03:31 PM] Deciusmus: The "Events" folder is actually really useful when making stuff up
[2023-11-01 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-11-01 03:32 PM] rsulfuratus: someday I'm going to rewrite all the dunmar stuff in timeline + events format
[2023-11-01 03:32 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. it is easy to just say:
    
    DR 1592: So and so dies at the [[Battle of Whatever]] 
    
    then create the stub in Events\1592
[2023-11-01 03:33 PM] Deciusmus: Then if I ever wanted to make up details about the battle could just go to the one source for it
[2023-11-01 03:33 PM] Deciusmus: That's the other approach, actually, to something like history.
[2023-11-01 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: I'm going to start working on the history of CLeenseau soon (which was the whole point of my hobgoblin stuff, but I got distracted)
[2023-11-01 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: And I might try just timeline/events format in the Cleenseau article itself
[2023-11-01 03:34 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that could work
[2023-11-01 03:35 PM] rsulfuratus: I've found that I often care more about the broad sweep of things than a timeilne, so e.g. for Tollen it would be a bit difficult to convert to exclusively a timeline/events format, since what I wanted to capture really was the variable age of parts of the city
[2023-11-01 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: how about historical places? Does Kin-Aska or Avatus or Alcarinque belong in gazetteer
[2023-11-01 03:36 PM] Deciusmus: What I found useful for the Sembaran history was Eras + Overview + Timeline with Events
[2023-11-01 03:36 PM] rsulfuratus: I moved Drankor to history, I think historical places should go in history as well
[2023-11-01 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: Alcarinque probably stays in gazetteer, as I think e.g. Delwath would still say he is from there, and many other elves would as well.
[2023-11-01 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: functionally it might more be "Alcarinque-in-exile" these days but it didn't cease to exist
[2023-11-01 03:37 PM] Deciusmus: Isn't Alcarinque the kingdom that fell before the downfall
[2023-11-01 03:37 PM] Deciusmus: that's what the Obsidian note says
[2023-11-01 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: oh, right, I was thinking of Ainumarya
[2023-11-01 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, Alcarinque is history for sure
[2023-11-01 03:57 PM] Deciusmus: What do you think of this?
    https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/commit/677204b1e838d2036392fcd194c64271b63e931d
[2023-11-01 03:58 PM] rsulfuratus: that works really well I think
[2023-11-01 03:59 PM] rsulfuratus: easy to add to history when it is contained like that
[2023-11-01 04:13 PM] Deciusmus: where do you think an event should go that spans multiple years?
[2023-11-01 04:15 PM] rsulfuratus: at one point we talked about organizing events as century/decade/year/month and putting event notes in the lowest level that made sense
[2023-11-01 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: I have them just by Year/Month with lowest that makes sense
[2023-11-01 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: But I could add more organization
[2023-11-01 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: it might make sense just to add century as a top level organization
[2023-11-01 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: like that better
[2023-11-01 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: so you'd have 1500s/Great War, 1500s/1545/Battle of Urlich Peak
[2023-11-01 04:17 PM] rsulfuratus: probably won't be too many multiyear events; multiyear events that span centuries can just go in one folder arbitrarily
[2023-11-01 04:20 PM] Deciusmus: I'm making a folder "Ancient" for undifferentiated events that predate drankor
[2023-11-01 04:25 PM] Deciusmus: I moved everything out of Unsorted except the 2 events that have no dates ("Defeat of the Plague Trees" and "The [[Battle of Shrevandurg]]")
[2023-11-01 04:25 PM] Deciusmus: So I made an "Unknown" or just leave them in Unsorted?
[2023-11-01 04:27 PM] rsulfuratus: put those in 1600s
[2023-11-01 04:27 PM] rsulfuratus: they are listed in chronological order in the session notes, and they both come between Exile of the Fraternity of the Empty Moon (1620s) and the Summer of Red Storms (1709)
[2023-11-01 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: Should I just merge the PR?
[2023-11-01 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: Getting big
[2023-11-01 04:29 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, sounds good
[2023-11-01 04:30 PM] Deciusmus: I (slightly) rewrote he Mawar history hereL: https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/commit/0e21e132b286b762459ad1c0ba76bda21f256e8e#diff-1e31853fd616e0902c46d07120b420430bb471feeaeef052a062c174ca5b3a2
[2023-11-01 04:30 PM] Deciusmus: https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/blob/0e21e132b286b762459ad1c0ba76bda21f256e8e/History/The%20Chronicles%20of%20the%20Mawar.md
[2023-11-01 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: You have some `%%` SECRET bugs
[2023-11-01 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: I saw a `%%` SECRET section in Drankor
[2023-11-01 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: didn't read it but you might want to fix it
[2023-11-01 04:34 PM] rsulfuratus: ah. yes. i need `%%`SECRET with no space, I'll double-check
[2023-11-01 04:39 PM] rsulfuratus: what do you think of Plataforma Hills for the hills that separate western Cymea from the interior and the east?
[2023-11-01 04:39 PM] rsulfuratus: or Plataroma?
[2023-11-01 04:39 PM] Deciusmus: Plataforma sounds to much like Platform to me
[2023-11-01 04:39 PM] Deciusmus: Plataroma I like better
[2023-11-01 04:40 PM] rsulfuratus: Plataca?
[2023-11-01 04:40 PM] Deciusmus: I like that best
[2023-11-01 04:57 PM] rsulfuratus: how about Latazaro for the lizardfolk swamp on the border of Tyrwingha?
[2023-11-01 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: Outside the Dunmar stuff and brainstorming docs, is there any major content in GDrive that would be considered canonical
[2023-11-01 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: Sure
[2023-11-01 04:57 PM] rsulfuratus: divine order is not all copied over yet
[2023-11-01 04:58 PM] Deciusmus: I found a Timeline doc and aligned a couple of dates in my Sembara history with it
[2023-11-01 04:59 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure about other god stuff - dunmari pantheon, mos numena/eight divines, northern folk religions, kestavo, funerary traditiosn
[2023-11-01 04:59 PM] rsulfuratus: feels like there is a lot of religion / gods that might not be well represented in obsidian
[2023-11-01 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-11-01 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: The kestavo stuff is definitely not copied over
[2023-11-01 04:59 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a more extensive language doc that goes into a lot more detail than my note
[2023-11-01 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the religion stuff is the main thing though
[2023-11-01 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: oh also I'm not sure we have all the pre-Downfall human migration stuff in obsidian
[2023-11-01 05:00 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a lot of that as well
[2023-11-01 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: a lot of that I'd consider brainstorming
[2023-11-01 05:01 PM] rsulfuratus: well things like the ancient mariner culture and its timing/spread through green sea is pretty canonical
[2023-11-01 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: There are various contradictory and background strains of thought but I'm not sure any of it needs to be canonical history
[2023-11-01 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: That's true, there are bits that are
[2023-11-01 05:01 PM] rsulfuratus: the stuff about religious history is definitely more brainstorming
[2023-11-01 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: the basic framework of migrations leaving hkar, although not the details, is pretty central to a lot of the human culture stuff
[2023-11-01 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: I guess some of that would be well-placed in Obsidian under Worldbuilding
[2023-11-01 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, that is probably a good spot for it
[2023-11-01 05:39 PM] Deciusmus: Do you mind if I push a reorg of Worldbuliding?
    
    I'm creating 3 folders, plus leaving some stuff top-level:
    
    Background: Canonical information that should inform creation, but that doesn't really belong in the main "notes" section (i.e. human migrations from Hkar)
    Brainstorming: Dumps from other sources or raw brainstorming, not canonical
    Unnamed or Tentative: stubs or short stuff about places that either have a tentative name or no good name, or just need a home and don't have one yet (Pandar, for example)
[2023-11-01 05:39 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, that's fine. sounds good
[2023-11-01 05:42 PM] Deciusmus: Hkar is a definitive name, any reason not to move that to History?
[2023-11-01 05:43 PM] rsulfuratus: no, that should be in history.
[2023-11-01 05:43 PM] rsulfuratus: also actually Pandar can be considered definitive I believe. I can't find any mention of it in any forgotten realms wikis
[2023-11-01 05:46 PM] Deciusmus: how about Urlich Monastery
[2023-11-01 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: That is from Ulrich Monastery that was published in an old Dragon magazine adventure, I just switched the l and the r
[2023-11-01 05:48 PM] rsulfuratus: but honestly I see no reason not to keep the name
[2023-11-01 05:48 PM] rsulfuratus: St. Ulrich was/is a real catholic saint so it isn't like the author of the `*`dungeon magazine article made up the name
[2023-11-01 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I googled Urlich and got lots of hits for "did you mean Ulrich"
[2023-11-01 07:26 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed an update that fixes a lot of dangling links
[2023-11-01 07:26 PM] Deciusmus: And adds a  _MoC\Dangling Links that shows all links to non-existent pages
[2023-11-01 08:54 PM] rsulfuratus: testing a new build of taelgarverse with all the updates....
[2023-11-01 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: Poking around there are a few oddities. Not sure how to fix but for example I moved the main narrative about the northern deno’qai to the Northern Tribes file
[2023-11-01 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: Because nothing links it it didn’t get included
[2023-11-01 09:23 PM] Deciusmus: I guess that specific one is easy by adding something to one of the actual tribes like..
    One of the `[Northern Tribes]` of the Deno’qai
