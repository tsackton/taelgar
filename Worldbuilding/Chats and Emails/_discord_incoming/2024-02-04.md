    " In 1550, Rumors of an endless horde of orcs, and worse, reach Embry from Vostok in this time, and an embassy from several of the Vostok chieftains arrives, but is turned back with only a company of knights to support it, none of whom ever return to Sembara. But whatever chaos consumes the north, little of it reaches the Volta, save for rumors. But Jane and Bertram drop the title “High King of Vostok” from the royal titles and Vostok turns inward for its defenses. "
