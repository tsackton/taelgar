# Discord DM – 2025-05-17

[2025-05-17 05:11 PM] Deciusmus: So I’m finally running the Umdizka temple / ruin adventure tomorrow
[2025-05-17 05:12 PM] Deciusmus: The basic story is a place of research and learning re: souls is founded by Malach before he is known to be evil
[2025-05-17 05:13 PM] Deciusmus: Then he pushes deep into learning re: undead and lich-stuff - which eventually has some interactions with Umdizka and leaves the place ruined and corrupted. Malach leaves with whatever knowledge
[2025-05-17 05:15 PM] Deciusmus: Question: would it be out of place to have a Lakan monk involved before it became evil, perhaps attracted by the idea of a cross-cultural magical center of learning and research.
[2025-05-17 05:15 PM] Deciusmus: In game this matters as I want some interesting ghost
[2025-05-17 05:35 PM] rsulfuratus: running game for isaac + friends at the moment but will look in a bit while isaac is cooking. they are in castrella right now
[2025-05-17 05:35 PM] rsulfuratus: getting to reuse a bunch of stuff
[2025-05-17 06:38 PM] rsulfuratus: it would be a little unusual but not out of place. when was this going on?
[2025-05-17 06:38 PM] Deciusmus: 1600
[2025-05-17 06:39 PM] rsulfuratus: only problem is travel from dunmar to sembara is pretty difficult at that time, that is in the middle of one of the dunmar/hobgoblin wars
[2025-05-17 06:39 PM] rsulfuratus: but that doesn't mean it can't happen
[2025-05-17 06:39 PM] rsulfuratus: could be that the lakan monk was traveling in part to learn more about hobgoblins or something in the context of the northern war
[2025-05-17 08:58 PM] Deciusmus: (had friends over for dinner, so kinda lost the thread of this)
    
    my other idea was an elven scholar of some sort. realistically, I think this character is going to be minor, i.e. basically it is more backstory that might not even come up, or perhaps if the PCs are struggling a ghost of some sort who has been hiding out
