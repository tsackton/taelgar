# Discord DM – 2025-01-07

[2025-01-07 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: My basic thoughts are…
    (A) In-game, Delwath doesn’t want to see the crown destroyed. But he trusts Riswynn or himself to use it for good
    (B) from an abstract world building perspective Riswynn using it to expand the free orcs seems more interesting than Delwath using it to finish cleaning up the mess from Apollyon and bring back some degree of friendship between the elves and the humans 
    (C) on the other hand; a revival of the Peronar via Delwath could be interesting world-building wise. 
    (D) from a meta perspective hunting down cultists of apolloyon in the north doesn’t seem that fun as the next major arc ie compared to extra planar stuff. Delwath taking the crown to do that type of thing is an in-game out for why the rest of the party doesn’t do that
    (E) I like Delwath and would be happy to finish out the arc but also have several ideas for other characters that I’d be interested in playing
    (F) it does seem a little unsatisfying to NPCize Delwath rather than playing him out to level 20
[2025-01-07 04:58 PM] Deciusmus: On (E) I was noodling around with…
    
    A circle of the moon Druid (probably human maybe stone born)
    A fey wanderer ranger (perhaps himself fey)
    A paladin of the sibyl/wildling/night queen or maybe the skar ocean god
[2025-01-07 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: Druid kinda interesting but not a good balance for the party - another high charisma character makes more sense I think
[2025-01-07 04:59 PM] Deciusmus: Oh my other idea was a draconic sorcerer
[2025-01-07 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: I think my basic position is 
    (A) it would be a little unsatisfying to just destroy the crown both from a world building and a in-game character perspective
    (B) I’d really have fun making up a new character that hooks into the next arc in some fashion
    (C) I’m a little torn about giving up Delwath
[2025-01-07 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: So I’d prefer either Riswynn or Delwath take it but could easily go one way or the other. I think given Kate isn’t excited about a new character and I am, I’d lean toward Delwath taking it, unless world-building or other people opinions pushed the other way
[2025-01-07 08:34 PM] rsulfuratus: i think this all makes sense and given this perspective and what kate and I discussed it might make the most sense to just throw it open to everyone next week.
    
    i am not really excited about running a "hunting down cultists of apollyon" arc either so if everyone feels you can't leave that thread hanging i would push for delwath taking the crown
[2025-01-07 08:35 PM] rsulfuratus: but also you can't solve all the problems in the world or it will be too safe and peaceful for the next campaign....
[2025-01-07 08:35 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway this is a helpful perspective
[2025-01-07 08:38 PM] rsulfuratus: as a side note - i am keeping in mind the idea of a level 20 mini-arc sometime in the future (not as part of this campaign, but maybe in a couple of years after we've started something new), after delwath or riswynn has done what they can with the crown, where you all get back together to destroy it once and for all. so there could be an opportunity to play level 20 delwath later on even if he is NPCized at the moment
[2025-01-07 09:22 PM] Deciusmus: A ranger using a magic quarterstaff is probaly too Beryl-like, but its a little tempting.
    
    Fey wanderer ranger with drudic cantrips so just uses Shillelagh to fight in melee without a very good strength
[2025-01-07 09:57 PM] rsulfuratus: I've always liked the idea of the shillelagh ranger
[2025-01-07 09:57 PM] rsulfuratus: but it does feel a little beryl-esque
[2025-01-07 09:57 PM] rsulfuratus: the new version of sorcerer looks really fun at high levels, one of the best level 20 features in the game
[2025-01-07 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus: actually moon druid could be a lot of fun too - honestly party doesn't really need a high charisma character, wellby at least is proficient in persuasion and intimidation so min roll is 15 already, plus inspiration
[2025-01-07 10:11 PM] rsulfuratus: moon druid could be a good opportunity to develop the moon before your lunar sorcerer gets too high level
[2025-01-07 10:15 PM] Deciusmus: So of my 4 ideas (draconic sorcerer, moon druid, paladin of some kind, or fey wanderer ranger) the moon druid and fey wanderer were the most interesting to me
[2025-01-07 10:17 PM] Deciusmus: Sorcerer seems the most fun from a mechanics perspective but I don’t have a great idea for world background. Also I felt like losing a front line fighter type might be less ideal (ie going with sorcerer)
[2025-01-07 10:19 PM] Deciusmus: I was leaning away from moon druid due to lack of cha but maybe you are right that doesn’t really matter
[2025-01-07 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus: It might be premature until seeing what happens at the discussion next week but from a worldbuilding point of view high level moon or dragon characters seem the most interesting to me
[2025-01-07 10:20 PM] Deciusmus: Not very inspired by paladin except that smite with Delwath is pretty fun. But I think I might save paladin for something else
[2025-01-07 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus: Seeker makes everyone an effective face, more or less
[2025-01-07 10:22 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking a fey who was a fey wanderer using a shilleghah as a weapon seemed kinda fun. But that might also be a good low level character
[2025-01-07 10:22 PM] Deciusmus: Moon druid and draconic sorcerer might be better high level options
[2025-01-07 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: I like them all but I do think the fey wanderer ranger build specifically doesn’t get a lot from being high level particularly
[2025-01-07 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus: But, it might be a fun character to tie to Isingue / cloud spinner / amber glow
[2025-01-07 10:25 PM] Deciusmus: Right. The background I had in mind was something from amber glow who had heard about cloudspinner somehow
[2025-01-07 10:26 PM] rsulfuratus: Moon Druid could have a similar backstory I think
[2025-01-07 10:27 PM] rsulfuratus: Anyway lots of good ideas imo
[2025-01-07 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus: Actually Kate was kind of into playing a Light cleric since she likes all the sunlight type spells so she might actually be more into a new character than appears on the surface, would just be similar mechanically to Riswynn in some ways
