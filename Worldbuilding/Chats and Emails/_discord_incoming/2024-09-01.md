# Discord DM – 2024-09-01

[2024-09-01 03:14 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure if you are still on Nantucket with your friends, but FWIW Nathaniel has been asking for a while to start a new family D&D campaign which we are finally doing soon, and I'm reviving Addermarch as the setting. Will probably be pushing some significant cleanup / updates over the next couple of days. when you have free time might be useful to chat a bit about relationships between Addermarch and Tyrwingha but no rush
[2024-09-01 05:08 PM] Deciusmus: Still on Nantucket but happy to text about addermarch a bit. Only have my phone but…
[2024-09-01 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: I have a few people from addermarch but haven’t developed it much. Figured it was somewhat more influenced by Tyrwingha than other places and the Darkwood is connected to Duskmire in some way
[2024-09-01 05:32 PM] rsulfuratus: basically trying to work out a rough history. my recollection from the Duskmire history is that the Darkwood goes way back. there is a note suggesting that Umbraeth was exiled in the DR 600s, but not sure if that is strictly canonical
[2024-09-01 05:33 PM] rsulfuratus: but assuming that Darkwood is a dangerous place during the Drankorian expansion (timing is not perfect, but relatively close), Addermarch is probably a pretty marginal backwater during the Drankorian era
[2024-09-01 05:34 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm imagining the geography/climate as kind of mid-Atlantic Applachians. Addermarch itself is pretty hilly with difficult overland travel, except along the (few) navigable rivers / river valleys
[2024-09-01 05:35 PM] rsulfuratus: so my basic history is that:
    - pre-Drankor, Addermarch is settled by Tyrwinghans, but is always fairly marginal
    - Drankor, it is a province of Drankor, but not a particularly important one. but crucially outside the deal with Ethlenn so more directly assimilated
[2024-09-01 05:36 PM] rsulfuratus: have some forestry, and the Aure is navigable as far as Addermarch, so not a total economic dead zone. but not rich by any means.
[2024-09-01 05:39 PM] rsulfuratus: in the Timeline of Sembaran history, Addermarch is noted to be established as the Earldom of Adderfell (presumably being called an Earldom due to cultural and historical connections to Tyrwingha) in lands formerly controlled by Avatus
[2024-09-01 05:42 PM] rsulfuratus: here it seems like there are two possibilities, based on the geography that has Addermarch as kind of a pocket surrounded by hills on three sides (west, south, east):
    - one option would be that this was an area that suffered from hobgoblin and other raids for a long time after the major defeats of Avataus, basically a backwater where many of the hobgoblins, etc, in Avatus army fled
    - a different option would be actually this was never conquered, but was cut of from Sembara by Avatus, and so during the post plague years it was really functionally a part of Tyrwingha
[2024-09-01 05:43 PM] rsulfuratus: in either case, it becomes part of the Sembaran crown during Derik I's rule, after the defeat of Avatus
[2024-09-01 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: I’m not convinced that Atavus stuff has to be canonical
[2024-09-01 05:46 PM] Deciusmus: I’ve imagined the western and northern borders of addermarch to be pretty rough terrain
[2024-09-01 05:46 PM] Deciusmus: So it seems plausible it was never conquered and has an older history
[2024-09-01 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, basic idea is that the western edge of the mostreve hills is a very rough, with a steep escarpment particularly on the west that borders the Gap of Maseau
[2024-09-01 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: less rough to the northeast where the Aure flows towards the Enst, of course, and less rough towards Tyrwingha
[2024-09-01 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: The Tyrwinghan part of the mostreve hills I’ve established as much denser in fey than elsewhere and not very settled but where settled very traditional
[2024-09-01 05:48 PM] rsulfuratus: that makes sense
[2024-09-01 05:49 PM] rsulfuratus: potentially Ethlenn's domain might extend southeast towards Orenlas, putting the Tyrwinghan Mostreve hills at the center
[2024-09-01 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah maybe
[2024-09-01 05:50 PM] Deciusmus: I think the settlement of addermarch was probably originally a bit complex - tyrwinghans but also clearly leaving Ethelenns domain
[2024-09-01 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: right. it has many cultural similarities to Tyrwingha but doesn't have the same fey connection which has a big impact
[2024-09-01 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: potentially in part settled by Tyrwinghans who *didn't* want to be part of Ethlenn's bargain
[2024-09-01 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: It might have originally been something of a frontier perhaps even a place of exile / banishment from Tyrwingha. Somewhat dangerous and with fey in the Darkwood on the southern border
[2024-09-01 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: Right the rejection of the bargain could work as well
[2024-09-01 05:52 PM] rsulfuratus: post-Drankor, my image of the vibe is kind of like the Dendarii Mountains in the Miles books, although without the implication of technological backwardness and the kind of dumb hill people stereotypes
[2024-09-01 05:53 PM] rsulfuratus: but a rough place that was the center of guerilla fighting during several post-Drankor, pre-Great War wars (e.g., Avatus), but never conquered and proud of it
[2024-09-01 05:53 PM] rsulfuratus: then, the same thing repeats during the hobgoblin wars. it is never conquered, but especially during the 3rd hobgoblin war it is completely isolated from Sembara
[2024-09-01 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah I like that
[2024-09-01 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-09-01 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: Honestly there isn’t really any reason it ever has to have been part of sembara
[2024-09-01 05:55 PM] Deciusmus: It might work better if it was simply always an independent frontier type place
[2024-09-01 05:55 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that's true
[2024-09-01 05:56 PM] Deciusmus: A backwater Drankorian province in the hills that was mostly known for the Darkwood in the south
[2024-09-01 05:57 PM] Deciusmus: Avatus never conquerors it but probes and maybe does some damage/marches through
[2024-09-01 05:57 PM] Deciusmus: But during the Avatus-Great War period is closely aligned with sembara and there are lots of back and forth
[2024-09-01 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: Then during the more recent hobgoblin wars it becomes more isolated again
[2024-09-01 05:58 PM] rsulfuratus: right, I think that makes sense. it might have a similar history to e.g. Vostok, in that during the height of the power of the Deriks the earl of adderfell swears personal fealty to Derik (as an underking type thing)
[2024-09-01 05:59 PM] rsulfuratus: but then post Great War it quickly departs the Sembaran orbit
[2024-09-01 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: And in the last 150 years has developed kinda independently with a bit of a “these are our hills “ vibe
[2024-09-01 06:00 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, especially until the final defeat of the hobgoblins in the 1650s it was repeatedly isolated from Sembara. and then even again e.g. during the undead crisis in your current campaign it would be the natural response of the people of Addermarch to retreat to the hills
[2024-09-01 06:01 PM] rsulfuratus: Adderfellians? Adderfelsh? hard to come up with a demonym
[2024-09-01 06:02 PM] Deciusmus: Adderians ? Adderese
[2024-09-01 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: hmm. lots of ideas here, but not sold on anything yet. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym
[2024-09-01 06:07 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway I think this basic history is logical, I'll probably push some updates tonight
[2024-09-01 06:08 PM] Deciusmus: When are you setting this family game? 1740s?
[2024-09-01 06:10 PM] rsulfuratus: probaby, haven't decided
[2024-09-01 06:25 PM] rsulfuratus: thinking also about titles and governance a bit, I'm leaning towards Addermarch retaining a system similar to Tyrwingha but without the fey influence. pre-Drankor, both Tyrwingha and Addermarch centralize power largely in the hands of the earls, a group of knights-errants basically, who answer to Ethlenn in Tyrwingha but perhaps to no central authority in Addermarch, or perhaps the earls elect one of their own to be overking.
    
    during Drankorian rule, the earls are coopted by the Drankorian state in both places with a governor ruling, but in Addermarch -- which has a much more violent post-Drankor history -- you basically revert back to earls electing an overking after Drankor falls
[2024-09-01 06:26 PM] rsulfuratus: so it has a lot of cultural parallels with Tyrwingha but more of a rugged independent vibe and without the fey influence
[2024-09-01 08:49 PM] rsulfuratus: on a related topic, do you have any names for political subunits of Tyrwingha? wondering if this should be English (e.g., shires) or more French, perhaps county
[2024-09-01 08:50 PM] Deciusmus: I’m not sure there are political subunits
[2024-09-01 08:50 PM] Deciusmus: I think earls have circuits
[2024-09-01 08:50 PM] Deciusmus: But not fixed domains per se
[2024-09-01 08:50 PM] rsulfuratus: but there are no layers between earls and individual manors?
[2024-09-01 08:51 PM] Deciusmus: I don’t think so. Tyrwingha is physically fairly small
[2024-09-01 08:53 PM] Deciusmus: Celyns village, which Kiya developed in a fair bit of detail, doesn’t have a lord of any sort except the earl
[2024-09-01 08:53 PM] Deciusmus: It was left a little unclear whether sembara introduced the idea of manorial feudalism
[2024-09-01 08:54 PM] rsulfuratus: right. i guess addermarch doesn't have to follow precisely but perhaps there isn't much benefit to introducing another layer
[2024-09-01 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: Or more specifically my view was something like….
    
    In traditional Tyrwingha there were earls who rode circuits and collected labor tithes from those on their circuits (and the earl and their household would basically live off the people and villages in their circuit)
[2024-09-01 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: In northern Tyrwingha sembaran manorial feudalism starting to spread from sembara
[2024-09-01 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: But I left it undeveloped how far jt had spread
[2024-09-01 08:56 PM] Deciusmus: One of the ideas is that in Tyrwingha the fey protect the people from the mysterious scary threats
[2024-09-01 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, that makes sense
[2024-09-01 08:57 PM] Deciusmus: Whereas in sembara that’s the job of the manorial lord
[2024-09-01 08:57 PM] rsulfuratus: addermarch has a lot of castles and forts that need to be supported
[2024-09-01 08:57 PM] Deciusmus: So there are less taxes and formal hierarchy in Tyrwingha
[2024-09-01 08:58 PM] Deciusmus: Addermarch on the other hand might have formalized a group of effectively castellans beneath the earls who control the defenses
[2024-09-01 08:58 PM] rsulfuratus: but i was imagining something that wasn't directly manorial feudalism, more like you have shires or counties or whatever that have a count or a baron or whatever, and then need to support defense via castles but the castles are generally occupied by a knight or a castellan who does not have any herditary claim on the land
[2024-09-01 08:59 PM] rsulfuratus: but maybe you can cut out the count/baron whatever and just have the knights/castellans as vassals of the earls
[2024-09-01 08:59 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, I’d do that. Addermarch is small. I think it’s smaller than Ireland for example
[2024-09-01 09:00 PM] rsulfuratus: it is about 23,000 square miles, ireland is about 25,000
[2024-09-01 09:03 PM] Deciusmus: It’s also a place that could be a bit random/not neat. Maybe there’s an uneven divide amongst the earls and the earl of the southern border has a couple of vassals between them and the knights
[2024-09-01 09:03 PM] Deciusmus: Not necessarily of course but if it makes sense for a story/histody
[2024-09-01 09:03 PM] Deciusmus: But I don’t think there should be a formalized subdivision like sembaran baronies
[2024-09-01 09:04 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah there are also some not neat things like the lord of adderfell is considered an earl despite not riding a circuit and functioning basically like a manorial lord
[2024-09-01 09:23 PM] Deciusmus: Another thing to think about is the fey influence isn’t empty on addermarch - the southern part is part of the fey “belt” right? But these are duskmire fey or perhaps other domains not so safe/under control as Tyrwinghan fey.
[2024-09-01 09:24 PM] Deciusmus: So I kinda think addermarch should have more of a fey influence then say sembara … but in a more “they are dangerous” way
[2024-09-01 09:24 PM] rsulfuratus: originally the idea was duskmire started in the region of the feywild colocated with darkwood
[2024-09-01 09:24 PM] rsulfuratus: (and is the source of the "Darkwood" name)
[2024-09-01 09:24 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2024-09-01 09:24 PM] Deciusmus: But that’s the southern border of addermarch right?
[2024-09-01 09:24 PM] rsulfuratus: yup
[2024-09-01 09:25 PM] Deciusmus: I guess addermarch itself is under less clear fey influence
[2024-09-01 09:25 PM] rsulfuratus: well, it is definitely a place where people worry about the fey
[2024-09-01 09:25 PM] rsulfuratus: but with almost the opposite vibes of tyrwingha
[2024-09-01 09:25 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-09-01 09:26 PM] rsulfuratus: except probably the the far eastern part of addermarch along the tyrwinghan border, which is relatively far from the darkwood and very close to ethlenn. possibly colocated with sunset gate
[2024-09-01 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: As an aside - I haven’t developed the rangers a lot, but I’ve implied they are relatively active in addermarch
[2024-09-01 09:27 PM] rsulfuratus: what is your take on climate, geography, biomes, general landscape vibes of the tyrwinghan highlands?
[2024-09-01 09:27 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. western/southern border
[2024-09-01 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: Virgina Appalachia
[2024-09-01 09:28 PM] rsulfuratus: perfect
[2024-09-01 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: Addermarch is roughly divided into four major geographic regions:
    - To the west and northwest, the Maseau Escarpment is a region of rough hills and some mountains that borders the flat plains of the Maseau Gap. This is a hard land with few people. This area was extensively fortified at multiple times in the past, but the castles in the hills have not all been maintained and many are now in ruins. `%%` very mountainous, steep cliffs, maybe Provence-like? white mountains `%%`
    - The center of the realm is the Aure river valley, a land of rolling hills, forests, and many rivers that cut through the hills. This region is the most densely settled, and includes Adderfell, the only real city in Addermarch. This is also the major agricultural land in Addermarch, and the center of brandy production. The Aure is navigable from Adderfell to the Enst, and many riverboats ply their trade along it. `%%` Shenandoah/Blue Hills, Susquehana river valley`%%`
    - To the south and east of the Aure valley are several lines of wooded hills and mountains, rising gradually to the height of land on the eaves of the Darkwood. This region is well-guarded, and lightly populated, mostly with smallholds of foresters and furriers. `%%` also mid-Atlantic Appalachians but very wooded`%%`
    - To the east and northeast, along the borders of Tyrwingha, the poor soil of the hilly, rocky land keeps forests to sheltered valleys. This is largely rangeland: sheep and cattle graze in the high pastures in summer, and only in a few sheltered valleys do crops survive. `%%` more open meadows, less forests, perhaps also a bit Provence-ish? `%%`
[2024-09-01 09:35 PM] Deciusmus: What about the northern hills?
[2024-09-01 09:35 PM] rsulfuratus: that is part of the Maseau Escarpment
[2024-09-01 09:35 PM] Deciusmus: I’d see the hills to the east more like the hills to the south
[2024-09-01 09:36 PM] Deciusmus: I think the Tyrwinghan / adderfell border is thicker forested hills than what you have above?
[2024-09-01 09:37 PM] rsulfuratus: I need to draw it out on a map and play a bit with it. i think I'm imagining that there are some higher mountains
[2024-09-01 09:37 PM] rsulfuratus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-57F08.png]]
[2024-09-01 09:38 PM] rsulfuratus: kind of along the part of the border that runs east/west
[2024-09-01 09:38 PM] rsulfuratus: not the border that runs north/south
[2024-09-01 09:39 PM] Deciusmus: Although maybe the forested slopes on the northern/eastern side give way to worse soil and rocky land on the west/south slopes
[2024-09-01 09:41 PM] Deciusmus: The only thing I’ve established is that the hills to the far east are pretty forested
[2024-09-01 09:44 PM] Deciusmus: Also that the land between the mostreve hills and the enst is rocky with steep hills and forested valleys, but hard to navigate as it rises to the Appalachian-like peaks between adderfell  and the borderlands. Basically you wouldn’t go that way if you could help it versus down the Aure
[2024-09-01 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, this is what I'm calling the Maseau Escarpment
[2024-09-01 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: basically like a big "C" with the lower curve truncated on the west end of the mostreve hills
[2024-09-01 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: on the very western edge it is very steep and drops to a flat(ish) plain at the "Gap of Maseau" but the north is broader and probably more mountains and less dramatic cliffs rising from a plain
[2024-09-01 09:47 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that works
[2024-09-01 09:48 PM] Deciusmus: I had a barony of mostreve and a barony of brumecliff along the mountains in the borderlands.
[2024-09-01 09:48 PM] Deciusmus: Neither name has to be canonical
[2024-09-01 09:49 PM] Deciusmus: I was kinda figuring they were named after features of the mountains but never sorted it out in detail
[2024-09-01 09:51 PM] rsulfuratus: I am going to work on a mostreve hills page with a bit more detail on how I image the geography but open to changes
[2024-09-01 09:51 PM] rsulfuratus: probably not tonight
