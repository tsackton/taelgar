[2023-11-28 10:09 AM] Deciusmus: We should define a bit of standardization on typeOf/subTypeOf/ancestry for places
[2023-11-28 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: Just to follow up on this, I spent a bit of time looking at how we are using typeOf / etc today on items + places, and I think we are missing a feature.
    
    I propose the following update.
    
    (a) typeOf - this should be a relatively well defined, relatively limited set of values intended to support data queries
    (b) typeOfAlias - newly introduced. This is used in display strings as an alias for typeOf and can be used when you want to change how the type is described. Never meaningful in data queries.
    (c) subTypeOf - an adjective or descriptive noun (ruined, abandoned, forest, manor, etc) that helps clarify what the thing is. Might be sometimes uses in searches, and particularly useful when you want to characterize something as two things (i.e. forest realm or section of road)
    (d) ancestry - always used to describe the kind of people who live in or lived in a place
[2023-11-28 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: Examples:
    
    Lakan Monastery:
    From:
    ```{ typeOf: monastery }```
    to 
    ``` { typeOf: holy site, typeOfAlias: monastery, ancestry: Dunmari, subTypeOf: Laka }```
    
    Akela Inn
    From:
    ```{ typeOf: inn, subTypeOf: caravanserai }```
    To
    ``` { typeOf: inn, typeOfAlias: caravanserai, ancestry: Dunmari }```
    
    
    Dunmari Fort (Gomat)
    From:
    ```{typeOf: fort, ancestry: ruined }```
    
    To
    
    ```{typeOf: fort, ancestry: Dunmari, subTypeOf: ruined }```
    
    
    Stormcaller Tower
    From:
    ```{typeOf: ruin }```
    
    To
    
    ```{typeOf: fort, typeOfAlias: tower, subTypeOf: ruined }```
[2023-11-28 03:12 PM] Deciusmus: The standard display string then becomes:
    
    `<ancestry>` `<subTypeOf>` `<typeOfAlias??typeOf>`
[2023-11-28 03:12 PM] Deciusmus: And we can avoid having to override the wHome for places that want to use a different display name for the type of
[2023-11-28 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: This would also help with cities.. For example, we could change all towns / villages / hamlets / cities to be typeOf: settlement, typeOfAlias: `<whatever>`
[2023-11-28 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: The ultimate goal here is to make queries easier, i.e. make it a lot more straightforward to get a list of all inns, all ruined places, all settlements, etc
[2023-11-28 03:15 PM] Deciusmus: The same logic can apply to items, i.e. for vehicles where you want the typeOf to be vehicle but for it to display as "caravan" or "skyship" or "boat"
[2023-11-28 03:15 PM] Deciusmus: This would also make it easier to start having specific behaviors for certain types of pages, i.e. having the whereabouts logic work differently if a page is a vehicle
[2023-11-28 04:17 PM] Deciusmus: BTW, dated wherabouts for places works great
[2023-11-28 05:14 PM] rsulfuratus: I think this sounds reasonable, I am quite busy at work for the next few weeks and have to write a session for Thursday so realistically not going to probably think about Obsidian related stuff until the weekend, but I think this is a good change. i might quibble about some details but that is fine to revise later. once we have a bunch of stuff with typeOf: fort it is easier to go back and see if some things don't belong
[2023-11-28 06:54 PM] rsulfuratus: stub for the Deno'qai godcaller is already in obsidian, jotha, feel free to change gender if you want
[2023-11-28 07:15 PM] rsulfuratus: I think take the orcs too if you want
[2023-11-28 07:17 PM] Deciusmus: We also need a gardener
[2023-11-28 07:18 PM] rsulfuratus: I have an elf gardener
[2023-11-28 07:18 PM] Deciusmus: Technically the garden and the greenhouse both have a tender
[2023-11-28 07:18 PM] Deciusmus: Although we don’t need to fully staff stuff obvs
[2023-11-28 07:19 PM] rsulfuratus: You flesh out elf instead of orcs if you want
[2023-11-28 07:19 PM] rsulfuratus: I think ship would be crowded if everything is fully staffed o assume most people do two jobs, plus you all
[2023-11-28 07:22 PM] rsulfuratus: I think orcs should probably be one librarian type and one brawler / fighter type
[2023-11-28 07:23 PM] Deciusmus: I’ll do the orcs. Was just thinking we could use a lizardfolk for completeness
[2023-11-28 07:23 PM] rsulfuratus: Ha yeah eventually you need a lizardfolk and a stoneborn and some interesting fey…
[2023-11-28 07:27 PM] Deciusmus: Also if we are getting level 13 stuff we should at least have a archive and a mediation chamber. Maybe we at least need an archivist of some sort
[2023-11-28 07:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i was thinking one of the orcs could be an archivist
[2023-11-28 08:07 PM] rsulfuratus: actually i had an idea for one of the orcs, maybe it makes more sense for them not to be twin sisters
[2023-11-28 08:19 PM] Deciusmus: I like the orcs as twin sisters, but haven't started making them up
[2023-11-28 08:19 PM] Deciusmus: I'm trying to organize our rooms
[2023-11-28 08:19 PM] Deciusmus: what's the elf's name again?
[2023-11-28 08:20 PM] rsulfuratus: Égnir (he/him, AY-nyeer)
[2023-11-28 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: not yet in obisidian?
[2023-11-28 08:20 PM] rsulfuratus: sure stick with twin sisters
[2023-11-28 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: I'm making a page for our rooms
[2023-11-28 08:20 PM] Deciusmus: our to-be state of our rooms
[2023-11-28 08:20 PM] rsulfuratus: just made a page, will push
[2023-11-28 08:32 PM] rsulfuratus: my idea for the orc was an archivist/lore master,  who has been gathering records and rumors of other free orcs for a while and now wants to look for rumors in the outside world. could function as archivist easily and run the archive
[2023-11-28 08:32 PM] rsulfuratus: but could definifitely stick w/ twin sisters
[2023-11-28 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: here is what I have so far:
    
    Upper Deck:
    
    * the shrine to the [[Tanshi|tanshi]], tended by [[Jotha]] 
    * the elven garden and greenhouse, tended by [[Egnir]]
    * the elven tree, grown from seed by [[Kenzo]]
    * the main building on the upper deck, which contains a lavish dining hall, space for conversation and relaxation, the living quarters of [[Kenzo]], [[Delwath]], [[Riswynn]], [[Seeker]], [[Wellby]], and the map room, tended by ~kenku scout~ and ~mapmaker~
    * the courtyard bow-ward of the main building, and the decking and railings around the main building, which is decorating with memorials to the adventures of the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] and tended by [[Kenzo]] and [[Amil]]
[2023-11-28 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: Lower Deck:
    
    * [[Seeker|Seeker's]] game room
    * [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak's]] workshop
    * the archives and research library, tended by ~tbd~
    * the smithy, tended by ~smith~
[2023-11-28 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: Storage Deck:
    
    * [[Baxter|Baxter's]] accomodations and stable area
    * a storage hold
[2023-11-28 08:47 PM] Deciusmus: Gamewise that would be:
    
    * Sanctury   (5)
    * Garden (5) & Greenhouse (9)
    * Meditation Room (13)
    * Library (5)
    * Trophy Room (9)
    * Training Area (9)
    * Workshop (5)
    * Archive (13)
    * Smithy (5)
    * Stable (9)
    * Storehouse (5)
[2023-11-28 08:47 PM] rsulfuratus: Eric wants an observatory
[2023-11-28 08:48 PM] Deciusmus: I was going to say we need to add an observatory somewhere
[2023-11-28 08:48 PM] Deciusmus: and a second training hall, probably
[2023-11-28 08:48 PM] Deciusmus: that's 14 special facilities total
[2023-11-28 08:48 PM] Deciusmus: I was calcuating the space, pretty sure it all fits fine but was going to double check
[2023-11-28 08:49 PM] rsulfuratus: kate also wants a dwarven shrine
[2023-11-28 08:49 PM] Deciusmus: yeah she should have a sanctum
[2023-11-28 08:49 PM] Deciusmus: or a reliquary
[2023-11-28 08:49 PM] Deciusmus: or both
[2023-11-28 08:51 PM] rsulfuratus: reliquary is super useful from a game point of view since it gets you material components for hero's feast 1/week for free
[2023-11-28 08:51 PM] rsulfuratus: sanctum is level 17
[2023-11-28 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: right I meant sacristry
[2023-11-28 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: But let's say we add:
    
    * observatory on upper deck
[2023-11-28 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: that probably fills up the upper deck
[2023-11-28 08:52 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2023-11-28 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: Reliquary down by the smithy
[2023-11-28 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: although actually the upper deck is only ~250 squares, even including 128squares for a roomy parlor, kitchen, dinining + living quarters x5
[2023-11-28 08:55 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, 200 x 80 is a lot of square footage.
[2023-11-28 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: but also the courtyard and tree is probably a vast facility
[2023-11-28 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: (36 squares)
[2023-11-28 08:56 PM] Deciusmus: I guess the garden should be vast
[2023-11-28 08:56 PM] Deciusmus: and the greenhouse vast
[2023-11-28 08:56 PM] Deciusmus: I gave garden + greenhouse = 52 squares
[2023-11-28 08:57 PM] rsulfuratus: i'd count them each as vast, which gives you two garden options. the vast greenhouse is just flavor to give space for the tree
[2023-11-28 08:57 PM] rsulfuratus: but still probably have space for a few more things on the top deck to be added later
[2023-11-28 08:58 PM] Deciusmus: I made the meditation chamber vast and indicated that it also counted as a vast courtyard
[2023-11-28 08:58 PM] Deciusmus: so it takes 40 squares
[2023-11-28 08:59 PM] Deciusmus: Garden and Greenhouse are also both  vast
[2023-11-28 09:00 PM] Deciusmus: 312 squares used on top floor
[2023-11-28 09:03 PM] rsulfuratus: I'd say maybe 408 usable on top floor so still room for a bit more later
[2023-11-28 09:04 PM] rsulfuratus: btw, totally separately, I was looking at the D&D Playtest stuff. Monks and Rogues have a lot of cool things I was going to see if Schwartz and Kong want. most of the warlock stuff is about making pact of the blade viable for non-hexblades and i think not worth the trouble of reworking your entire character, but there are a few useful features if you are interested in either of these:
    - Magical Cunning: If all your Pact Magic spell slots are expended, you can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute, at the end of which you regain half of those spell slots (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
    - Contact Patron: In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw. Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
[2023-11-28 09:05 PM] Deciusmus: The main thing I want is the 3rd extra attack
[2023-11-28 09:05 PM] Deciusmus: and ritual casting
[2023-11-28 09:05 PM] rsulfuratus: where is the 3rd extra attack? i must have missed that
[2023-11-28 09:05 PM] rsulfuratus: ritual casting is fine
[2023-11-28 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: THIRSTING    BLADE
    Prerequisite:    Level    5+    Warlock,    Pact    of    the    Blade
    You    gain    the    Extra    Attack    feature    for    your    pact    
    weapon    only.    With    that    feature,    you    can    attack    
    twice    with    the    weapon,    instead    of    once,    when    
    you    take    the    Attack action    on    your    turn.
    When    you    reach    level    11 in    this    class,    this    
    Extra    Attack    confers    two    extra attacks    rather    
    than    one.
[2023-11-28 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: oh on thirsting blade. i didn't read all the invocations
[2023-11-28 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: with ritual casting and comprehend language, I'd swap out eyes of the rune keeper for something actually useful
[2023-11-28 09:08 PM] Deciusmus: and the third attack makes a huge difference in terms of making sword attacks have parity with eldritch blast + agonizing blast
[2023-11-28 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: i actually think ritual casting + comprehend languages is much less useful than eyes of the rune keeper
[2023-11-28 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: you have to be able to touch the writing to understand it
[2023-11-28 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: thats true
[2023-11-28 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: so useless for scrying, mirror, any kind of dream vision
[2023-11-28 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: plus you need a 10 minute ritual for it to work
[2023-11-28 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, that is true
[2023-11-28 09:11 PM] Deciusmus: the other thing that would be appealing is the bonus spells
[2023-11-28 09:12 PM] Deciusmus: but sorcerors don't have bonus spells, so might need a bit of tweaking
[2023-11-28 09:12 PM] Deciusmus: anymore more interested in thinking about bastion than warlock rules right now
[2023-11-28 09:12 PM] rsulfuratus: mention it only because i am going to offer cunning strike to wellby and defect attacks to kenzo
[2023-11-28 09:13 PM] rsulfuratus: probably won't be any combat next session so can think about warlocks later
[2023-11-28 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: If I was doing anything, new thirsting blade + ritual casting would be the main thing
[2023-11-28 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: Here is what I have for hirelings, still trying to work out who tends each room:
    
    * Deno'qai (shrine)
    * Elf (garden + greenhouse)
    * Sacred tree (no one)
    * Kenku scout + mapmaker (map room)
    * Amil + halfling storyteller (hall of stories)
    * TDB, observatory
    
    =  7 on top floor
    
    * Training hall 1 (no one/seeker)
    * Faldrak (workshop)
    * training hall 2 (tbd + tbd)
    * archive (tbd)
    * smithy (~riswynn smith~)
    * reliquary (no one)
    
    = 5 on second floor
    
    storage deck:
    
    * stable (Tbd )
    * storage room (Adam Gower, not onboard)
    
    = 2
    
    == 14 total hirelings, of which 13 are on board. 5 are TBD, of which 2 are the orcs, so there are 3 complete TBDs.
    
    If that seems like too many, we could reduce by 2 by not having anyone for the stable (Wellby) and  the Observatory (Seeker) which would be 11 on board which feels kinda reasonable?
[2023-11-28 09:22 PM] Deciusmus: if that still seems like too many we could have the 2nd training hall be just staffed by one orc
[2023-11-28 09:22 PM] Deciusmus: and we'd have 10 on board
[2023-11-28 09:23 PM] rsulfuratus: i think wellby tends the stable
[2023-11-28 09:24 PM] rsulfuratus: (and maybe stable doesn't go in hold? i'd put dwarven stuff there and stable on top deck - i don't think wellby will want baxter in the hold)
[2023-11-28 09:25 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe ask schwartz where the stable goes at beginning of next session
[2023-11-28 09:25 PM] rsulfuratus: riswynn can tend reliquary
[2023-11-28 09:25 PM] rsulfuratus: i'd put one of the orcs on the archive
[2023-11-28 09:25 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, the stable could be somewhere else, that's true
[2023-11-28 09:26 PM] rsulfuratus: i'd leave observatory open for now too
[2023-11-28 09:26 PM] rsulfuratus: seeker / space for some random npc later
[2023-11-28 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: you really like the idea of the orc seeking people of the rainbow as the archivist...
[2023-11-28 09:28 PM] rsulfuratus: fine without it if you don't like it
[2023-11-28 09:28 PM] rsulfuratus: but the orcs will kind of blend into the background without a hook
[2023-11-28 09:28 PM] Deciusmus: True.
[2023-11-28 09:28 PM] Deciusmus: I've made quarters for 12 for now
[2023-11-28 09:28 PM] Deciusmus: plus the 5 of us
[2023-11-28 09:29 PM] Deciusmus: but I think we will have only 10 or 11 filled
[2023-11-28 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. probably need a guest suite too
[2023-11-28 09:29 PM] Deciusmus: Deno'qai, elf, kenku scout, mapmaker, Amil, halfling storyteller, Faldrak, smith apprentice, orcsx2 = 10 plus maybe one more depending on what idea I have for archivist/orcs
[2023-11-28 09:30 PM] rsulfuratus: i would not consider the kenku scout a hireling, per se, not guaranteed they will stick around after ursk
[2023-11-28 09:30 PM] Deciusmus: fair, well, the maproom is currently staffed by the kenku + the TBD mapmaker
[2023-11-28 09:30 PM] rsulfuratus: they are the person who is going to show you the back route
[2023-11-28 09:30 PM] rsulfuratus: mapmaker definitely
[2023-11-28 09:30 PM] Deciusmus: so maybe the kenku isn't a true hireling
[2023-11-28 09:31 PM] rsulfuratus: could become one but i wouldn't give them a formal role just yet
[2023-11-28 09:31 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2023-11-28 09:44 PM] Deciusmus: I am considering whether it would be fun to have a sembaran or isinquen or perhaps even a ranger onboard
[2023-11-28 09:44 PM] rsulfuratus: one option for mapmaker is an isinguer friend of Guy Marchand
[2023-11-28 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: Sembaran certainly possible too, if you wanted a Sembaran archivist for example could be easy to recruit from Tollen
[2023-11-28 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: but again, unless an NPC has a very strong hook, they are just going to be a background fixture
[2023-11-28 09:47 PM] Deciusmus: I think with 10 NPCs probably it is ok if some of them are background fixtures
[2023-11-28 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: which is fine
[2023-11-28 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: exactly
[2023-11-28 09:55 PM] Deciusmus: how about a tyrwinghan
[2023-11-28 09:56 PM] Deciusmus: I'm thinking:
    
    orc twin sisters, about 45-50, one seeking stories of the people of the rainbow, the other sees herself as her defender and keeper and is mostly background, but is a reasonably skilled warrior and tends the 2nd training hall
[2023-11-28 09:58 PM] Deciusmus: a Tyrwinghan, used to be in the army, perhaps even spent some time in the feywild, also tends the training hall, seeking something fey-related
[2023-11-28 09:58 PM] Deciusmus: still pondering details
[2023-11-28 09:59 PM] Deciusmus: and I don't want "seeking fey" really, feels too similar. but something to do with fey
[2023-11-28 09:59 PM] rsulfuratus: so, doing some session planning, i am actually thinking that I don't want to introduce all the NPCs in one go, no one will remember them and it will be a slow session
[2023-11-28 09:59 PM] Deciusmus: that kinda makes sense
[2023-11-28 09:59 PM] rsulfuratus: so I think I'm going to do flashbacks to various meetings in Tollen over the course of the next 4-5 sessions
[2023-11-28 09:59 PM] rsulfuratus: so next session would just be the orcs and amil/the dwarf
[2023-11-28 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus: (and then the kenku meeting and getting off to the adventure)
[2023-11-28 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus: so anyone in tollen there would be room to fill in over the next month or two
[2023-11-28 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: the deno'qai could actually be lost in the wilderness
[2023-11-28 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus: obviously the deno'qai is wandering around the woods north of ursk
[2023-11-28 10:02 PM] Deciusmus: alright, I will let the idea of a sembaran/tyrwinghan linger
[2023-11-28 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: I think the orcs should be an archivist and a brawler
[2023-11-28 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus: are you imaging orcs as never had families, families died in war, leaving behind grown kids?
[2023-11-28 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus: kind of thinking maybe the archivist never had a family, the brawler lost family in war and so is finally willing to travel with sister
[2023-11-28 10:09 PM] Deciusmus: I was envisioning a tragic story of some kind for one of them, less sure about the other
[2023-11-28 10:09 PM] Deciusmus: but perhaps actually it is more interesting to invert the stereotype and basically make them empty nesters
[2023-11-28 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: or at least one of them
[2023-11-28 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: I don't know much about orc family life, or lifespan
[2023-11-28 10:10 PM] Deciusmus: how old is 50?
[2023-11-28 10:15 PM] Deciusmus: but I'm thinking something like... some tragedy in their youth, lost parents, became very close, archivist married into a large, boisterious, happy family, brawler more reserved and introverted and never had kids but was an aunt, archivist in her late 30s became passionate about the history of her in-laws, who were perhaps a significant in the longer history of the people of the rainbow
    
    many of the family were soliders in the late war, but miraclously, none of them died, which the archivist took to be a sign (from? I guess these orcs don't really like gods.. need to think about that a bit) that she should go looking for stories, brawler is thrilled, has always secretly prefered having her sister to herself
[2023-11-28 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus: orc lifespan roughly human conditional on surviving to 30
[2023-11-28 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus: most non-free orcs die before 30 from war/famine/violence
[2023-11-28 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus: (i guess not famine actually, orcs can survive on almost any food)
[2023-11-28 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus: so age structure of free orcs probably fairly similar to humans
[2023-11-28 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus: although i imagine a much more bimodal family size - not many with 1 kid, but lots with 0 and lots with 5
[2023-11-28 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus: i have always imagined a significant minority of free orcs would be wary of having kids because they don't fully trust thark won't somehow get them
[2023-11-28 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: and another significant minority would have *lots* of kids because they *do* trust thark wont get them
[2023-11-28 10:23 PM] Deciusmus: I seem to remember that chained-and-freed-after birth orcs have a hard time of it?
[2023-11-28 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2023-11-28 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus: depends on age they are freed
[2023-11-28 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus: murook was freed very late, as a teenager or close to it, which would be quite unusual
[2023-11-28 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus: but the freed-after-birth orcs would be very unlikely to leave Xurkhaz
[2023-11-28 10:26 PM] Deciusmus: how's this.
    
    Nurzkar and Aygul are 51 years old, born near Gorzum oasis, to relatively poor farmers. Their parents were both born chained orcs and both struggle. In their father, this manifests as nightmares, weeks sometimes in bed with migraines. In their mother, who was freed when she was 8, this manifests as violent outbursts, where she often has to be restrained. Despite this, the parents are fervant believers in Xurkhaz and envision there salvation will be in their children, born free and unchained and untouched by Thark.
[2023-11-28 10:27 PM] Deciusmus: The twins are born first, then their three siblings, soon after. However, tragedy strikes when the twins are 8. They are at this point old enough to help out on the farm, and one afternoon when their father can't work due to his headaches, their mother goes into a rage and kills the three younger children.
[2023-11-28 10:28 PM] Deciusmus: This dissolves the family - both parents are wracked with guilt, and the twins are fostered out
[2023-11-28 10:29 PM] Deciusmus: (Perhaps the mother is punished, but I have to think there is some understanding and management of chained orcs, anyway the details there are not important to our story)
[2023-11-28 10:30 PM] Deciusmus: The twins grow close to each other in this time, both responding to the tragedy in different ways. Nurzkar wants to `**`understand**. How are orcs chained? Where did her parents come from (all she knows it that they are from the same horde). Aygul, on the other hand, just wants to learn to defend herself. She never wants to be in the position where someone else can hurt her
[2023-11-28 10:31 PM] Deciusmus: They bounce around orcish society for a while, eventually growing into adults. Nurzkar is the more outgoing one, and ends up meeting `<some name>`, the 8th son of a large family who proudly traces their lineage back 10 generations
[2023-11-28 10:32 PM] Deciusmus: They marry, have kids, and Nurzkar becomes fascinated by the histories her adoptive family tells
[2023-11-28 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: this sounds great so far
[2023-11-28 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus: talking to kate about her dwarf smith so will check in in a bit
[2023-11-28 10:34 PM] Deciusmus: Nurzkar and her husband have a large family, the youngest of whom is an oldish teenage when Grash attacks
[2023-11-28 10:34 PM] Deciusmus: Much of the family ends up in war - by this time they are living in the capital and have some moderately promiment position
[2023-11-28 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: Nurzkar and Aygul both worry -- Aygul perhaps even joins up, despite being a bit on the older side, she is wiry and skilled with weapons and unarmed combat techniques. Both worry about the end of their people. 
    
    Nurzkar, for much of her life, has felt like she could be doing more. The drive to learn/understand/help the chained orcs, and find more orcs to unchain/more People of the Rainbow who are lost kept being put aside due to the basic joy of her life, and the busy-ness of raising a family, etc
[2023-11-28 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: But something happens during the conflict with Grash - my original idea was a prayer but that doesn't really make sense here -- that inspires her to rededicate herself to this childhood dream of learning how Thark chains people and finding others
[2023-11-28 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: So when a flying ship appears, looking for a loremaster and archivist, and willing to carry her around the known world, with her limp and bad eyesight, she jumps
[2023-11-28 10:40 PM] Deciusmus: Her sister is eager to go with her -- Aygul has always been the type who would have gone into the world, but she would not leave her sister, even though her sister kept talking about exploring/looking for stories/etc
[2023-11-28 10:40 PM] Deciusmus: need to tweak a bit but the basic idea is Nurzkar is leaving behind a happy family, Aygul is more of a loner
[2023-11-28 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus: There is a group, called the Hezguli, that is kind of like AA for orcs freed after birth. Murook is an unofficial leader. Orcs that have trouble adjusting, or end up in situations like this, would typically end up living with the Hezguli under their supervision
[2023-11-28 10:46 PM] rsulfuratus: Xurkhaz was founded in 1583 when Uzgash found the cloak, so the timing would be good for the proud family to trace their lineage back to the founders of Xurkhaz
[2023-11-28 10:47 PM] Deciusmus: Right that’s perfect. The mother goes to live with the Hezguli and the father is left to raise them but his headaches and depression really don’t get better and they basically raise themselves
[2023-11-28 10:48 PM] rsulfuratus: Orcs fundamentally think gods are evil, but of course Riswynn will have changed many minds recently. I'd probably make it basically she is inspired by Riswynn
[2023-11-28 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus: Faldrak is already the "has a limp and is obviously old character", I think the orc hook is enough to be looking for storie without needing to have the limp and bad eyesight too.
[2023-11-28 10:51 PM] Deciusmus: To add, the father each morning gets up and thanks the miracle of the cloak, because this is better. Having a wife who kills 3 of your kids- better than being chained. Having crushing headaches and nightmares 2-3 times a week? Better than being chained.
[2023-11-28 10:51 PM] Deciusmus: Sure
[2023-11-28 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus: can also be a fey connection, or at least a loose one  - "the miracle of the cloak" isn't precisely a miracle, it was a gift from Cloudspinner, an archfey, but it was given as a reward, a boon that was earned (why exactly is not really currently known)
[2023-11-28 10:54 PM] rsulfuratus: so I think the orcs of Xurkhaz especially would, to the extent they have any sort of prayers, it would be to thank their ancestors who earned the boon of a fey
[2023-11-28 10:54 PM] rsulfuratus: so maybe not really a fey connection so much as almost a kind of ancestor worship
[2023-11-28 10:55 PM] Deciusmus: I am envisioning the father more directly thanking the leaders of Xurkhaz
[2023-11-28 10:55 PM] rsulfuratus: right, yes, that would definitely make sense
[2023-11-28 10:57 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it would generally be understood that it is hard, and sometimes dangerous work, to maintain the safe borders of Xurkhaz and the chiefs of Xurkhaz are very much not stay at home kings and queens - they literally have to walk the entire borders of the country over the course of their reign
[2023-11-28 11:02 PM] Deciusmus: I gotta go to bed but either you can work with this as is or I’ll flesh it out a little more tomorrow
[2023-11-28 11:02 PM] Deciusmus: I have some ideas for the Deno’qai as well, will she come up next session?
[2023-11-28 11:03 PM] Deciusmus: I also wrote a whole page on obsidian for all our rooms, I will clean that up and push tomorrow
[2023-11-28 11:05 PM] rsulfuratus: you won't meet Deno'qai next session
