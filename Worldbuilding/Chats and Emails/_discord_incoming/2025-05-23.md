[2025-05-23 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus: messing around a bit with rivers in taelgarverse, primarily filling out the rest of the west coast chasa-nahadi system, where i have a lot of notes but not many names from the great library campaign. 
    
    did we ever decide how we are supposed to organize these, e.g. if a river or river system flows through multiple gazetteer regions?
    
    for now i am putting them in the region if they are fully contained, and in major rivers if not, but i'm not sure that is ideal and ends up being kind of arbitrary based on where lines are drawn and not actually based on river size/length. 
    
    i don't know if you have any thoughts or opinions or if it really matters much. an alterernative would be to put all of the chasa-nahadi watershed into major rivers, for example
[2025-05-23 12:01 PM] Deciusmus: I think in the east the rivers are all pretty much in a region.
[2025-05-23 12:02 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is reasonable to keep rivers together though, ie have the “chasa - nahadi” as a folder
[2025-05-23 12:05 PM] Deciusmus: But it is also probably fine if it is a bit arbitrary, if I was making up some small tributary of the Istabor that was mostly relevant for some adventure in Maseau I might be tempted to put it in the Maseau folder rather than some istabor folder
[2025-05-23 12:05 PM] Deciusmus: But if I was just cleaning up rivers on the map from notes I might be inclined to just dump in the root river system and if that is outside a single region, fine
