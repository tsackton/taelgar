# Discord DM – 2024-01-07

[2024-01-07 05:38 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a weird glitch with the website export where the callout boxes work when there is no pronunciation but don't work when there is a pronunciation. e.g. https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/Istaros%20Watershed/Orenlas/Erelion.html vs https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/Western%20Green%20Sea/Tollen/Tollen.html
[2024-01-07 05:39 PM] Deciusmus: huh
[2024-01-07 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: my next project is definitely going to be to dump the current obsidian ->` md ->` html workflow
