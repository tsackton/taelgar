# Discord DM – 2024-05-09

[2024-05-09 09:27 PM] rsulfuratus: probably won't have a chance to actually flesh out session notes until the weekend but I pushed the chatGPT parsed transcript and some bullet points on key rumors and a few songs. I don't remember now exactly when you went to sleep but a few bits at the end might have been after you left, in case you want to look. I think "The Ballad of the Jade Garden" was right at the end of the session
