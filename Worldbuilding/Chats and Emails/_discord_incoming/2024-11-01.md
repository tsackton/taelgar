# Discord DM – 2024-11-01

[2024-11-01 09:58 AM] rsulfuratus: I have been just hitting "Get random note" and fixing things up when I have 5-10 minutes between meetings or tasks, and have hit a row of organizations lately that makes me want to slightly refactor "organizations". In particular, I'm not sure that notes that describe cultures (Deno'qai, Vargaldi, orc hordes, hobgoblin clans) necessarily make sense in organizations (as opposed to gazeteer). e.g. we have all the various pages on Dunmar/Sembara political organization, culture, society in realms
[2024-11-01 09:58 AM] rsulfuratus: in particular it is a bit tricky to come up with a "type" for something like the Vargaldi note, beyond "culture". it is functionally more like the "Dunmar" page
[2024-11-01 10:06 AM] Deciusmus: We've always had a bit of an organizational problem with "culture" type things.
[2024-11-01 10:06 AM] Deciusmus: like where does "Oracle of the Riven" belong? Should it be in Gazetter under Tyrwingha?
[2024-11-01 10:07 AM] Deciusmus: (probably?)
[2024-11-01 10:07 AM] rsulfuratus: also in cleaning up the vargald note it is apparent we could use pages for things like the Zimka and the Northerners
[2024-11-01 10:07 AM] rsulfuratus: (which would also be strictly culture / history pages)
[2024-11-01 10:08 AM] Deciusmus: but the gazetteer is organized geographically, which makes something like the People of the Rainbow a weird fit
[2024-11-01 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus: I'm actually less concerned with things like the Oracle of the Riven, or the Society of the Open Scroll, which while they could easily fit in either gazeteer or organizations, are clearly organizations by any definition of the word
[2024-11-01 10:08 AM] Deciusmus: I can see how they are not necessarily a good fit for Organizations (which works better for smaller groups) but I'm not sure where to put them in Gazetteer
[2024-11-01 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus: i'm more concerned with things that are more like ancestries that don't work well with the type categorizations of "organization"
[2024-11-01 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus: e.g. people of the rainbow is really the equivalent of "Sembaran" for orcs,
[2024-11-01 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus: as opposed to e.g. the Hezguli, the group of orcs who became free orcs in adulthood, which is clearly an organization
[2024-11-01 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus: but in some ways I'm less worried about where they "go" and more about how to handle headers and writing style
[2024-11-01 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus: e.g. for a normal organization I'd typically clean up the page by adding a campaign None block with members, and writing the note to try to capture any information about the organizations goals, history, mission
[2024-11-01 10:12 AM] Deciusmus: Right... perhaps introducing a new "page type" of culture would make sense
[2024-11-01 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus: for a culture I'd write in more in the style of the Dunmar page, albeit likely in less detail
[2024-11-01 10:14 AM] Deciusmus: and then we could add cultures either:
    
    (a) under Species
    (b) under Gazetteer at a top level
    (c) under Gazetteer nested in the geographic region where the culture mostly is
    (d) (a) for cultures that don't have a clear geographic fit, (c) for those that do
    (e) (b) for cultures that don't have a clear geographic fit, (c) for those that do
[2024-11-01 10:15 AM] Deciusmus: I think ancestry is a good way of thinking about it. Cultures are the pages that should link from a person or thing's "ancestry" tag
[2024-11-01 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus: i don't really have time to undertake a major reorg today so what I might do for now is (a) use "culture" instead of "organization" as the top-level tag where it makes more sense, and (b) make a cultures subdir in organizations to move culture-tagged notes to to prep for any later reorg
[2024-11-01 10:16 AM] Deciusmus: that seems sensible
[2024-11-01 10:17 AM] Deciusmus: you might do organization/culture for now as I think a bunch of stuff depends on the top level tag
