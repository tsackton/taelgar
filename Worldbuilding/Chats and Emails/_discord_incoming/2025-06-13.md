# Discord DM – 2025-06-13

[2025-06-13 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus: guessing you are too busy at work and with trip prep to think about taelgar much, but in case not: i am working on the next adventure for my addermarch campaign, and it is likely to impinge on the feywild a bit, which is leading me to finally try to anchor this in time. 
    
    contemplating two main options, which have different implications.
    
    option 1 is roughly contemporaneous with your cleenseau game, probably either a few years before (e.g., around 1715) or a few years after (e.g. around 1725). this potentially allows a fair bit of reuse of material between games, but requires a bit of coordination to keep the timeline untangled, especially concerning feywild politics (although i will likely focus more on Hollowdark / Darkfall than Duskmire)
    
    option 2 is around 1740, say 5-10 years before the dunmar campaign begins. this makes it a bit more challenging to reuse material as it puts it about a generation after your game, but simplifies the coordination problems to a certain extent as the cleenseau events are then just "history" and easier to leave in the background
    
    do you have any opinions?
[2025-06-13 10:53 AM] Deciusmus: I actually kinda like contemporaneous
[2025-06-13 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus: i kind of do too, but it puts a little more pressure on both of us to keep game notes updated was my only hesitation...
[2025-06-13 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: have a meeting but more thoughts in a bit
[2025-06-13 11:26 AM] rsulfuratus: on a related topic, here is my feywild map. 
    
    (1) Twilight's Grace
    (2) undefined, needs work
    (3) Duskmire + extensions
    (4) Darkfall
    (5) Hollowdark
    (6) Amberglow
    (7) Shimmersong
    (8) Sharpspire
    (9) Everlight's Bloom
    (10) Emberwine
    
    red line is Sunset Gate
    
    east of Darkfall and south of Hollowdark are also undefined. east of Darkfall overlaps Orenlas and should be allied with Twilight's Grace; south of Hollowdark less clear, I had some rough idea of a land of peaceful dreams or something like that

[2025-06-13 12:13 PM] Deciusmus: So in general I’m happy to commit to better sharing/notes. We have had some scheduling issues and slow role play focused sessions so plot is a little behind. 
    
    I think setting Addermarch a little bit before Cleenseau is easier than a little bit after although I’m not sure.
[2025-06-13 12:15 PM] Deciusmus: Basically I have two big plot things coming up-
    1) The Gloomshaper is going to attempt to kidnap Elaine II (Queen of Sembara post Lich) and use her connection to Ethlenn to permanently open the portal to Cleenseau
[2025-06-13 12:16 PM] Deciusmus: 2) PCs are likely going to stop this and end up needing to escape from Duskmire, likely via the poorly defined #2 on your map
    3) at some point I expect they will go on an adventure in Feywild to find more info about Greymalkin’s origin and get him his wings back
[2025-06-13 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: Just before Clee has the advantage that the outcome of #1 doesn’t matter.
[2025-06-13 12:18 PM] Deciusmus: And also that anything my PCs do to shake up things unexpectedly doesn’t cause issues
[2025-06-13 12:20 PM] Deciusmus: Kinda think 1715 for addermarch is pretty good. Your campaign feels not that likely to create some regional-impacting event
[2025-06-13 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i am leaning that way
[2025-06-13 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't expect this will likely get to particularly high levels and is mostly built around the possibility that we could just end the campaign after any adventure
[2025-06-13 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus: the only complication is that Nathaniel's backstory does tie to some of the minor fey realms in #2
[2025-06-13 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus: but that is likely more of a worldbuilding thing to plan, and less something that is likely to be reshaped in play
[2025-06-13 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus: i am currently writing the next addermarch adventure which is going to involve a minor fey incursion, so i may try to work out some of the details of #2 a bit
[2025-06-13 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus: i have meetings from 1-3 but otherwise a pretty light day
[2025-06-13 12:27 PM] Deciusmus: I'm pretty swamped between now and Africa
[2025-06-13 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i figured
[2025-06-13 12:28 PM] Deciusmus: but I don't have any real notions about what is in #2
[2025-06-13 12:28 PM] Deciusmus: I haven't introduced anything other than a few hints about the "minor lords" type "buffer zone"
[2025-06-13 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus: the main vibe i want to maintain is that addermarch feels very distinct from tyrwingha. while tyrwingha is protected by ethlenn, addermarch is explicitly contested, so you never know if the fey you encounter is "good" or "bad", using those terms very loosely
[2025-06-13 12:29 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2025-06-13 12:29 PM] Deciusmus: I had a minor NPC from Addermarch who was pretty nervous about fey, compared to the Tyrwinghans
[2025-06-13 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus: with a rough sense of "better" as you go north, while also not requiring anything "bad" towards the south to be explicitly duskmire, as darkfall is also right on the border
[2025-06-13 12:30 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is useful if for "reasons" the newest part of Duskmire (i.e. around Cleenseau wood) is the "best"
[2025-06-13 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus: (at the same time part of the goal of developing #2 is to give a sensible reason for duskmire to expand west/north)
[2025-06-13 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus: right exactly
[2025-06-13 12:31 PM] Deciusmus: also duskmire should stretch east as far as the Aveil hills and the river valley in Aveil, although it doesn't need to go as far east as Rinburg
[2025-06-13 02:08 PM] rsulfuratus: so looking at the map - my sense is the "contested area" is really Addermarch, the Enst river valley, and maybe as far north as the Wistel, but the Semb valley and the highlands are something else potentially left undefined for now, but likely either solidly allied with Ethlenn and uncontested (Semb valley) or just outside the context of the Umbraeth / Ethlenn conflict (Highlands, which might have their own problems with Sharpspire)
[2025-06-13 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that makes sense
[2025-06-13 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: I'd like it to spread as far north as wistel, but I see the wistel as kinda the dividing line between "southern sembara" and "sembaran heartland" and I think the Gloomshaper influence should somewhat align with that, although it doesn't have to be perfect
[2025-06-13 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: but I think broadly from the Darkwood in the south to the Wistel in the north and from Aveil/Rinburg in the west to the sunset gate in the east is about correct
[2025-06-13 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: okay here is a rough idea. borders are not exact. 
    
    (1) Lord Serenveil's territory is in gray, roughly along the eastern Enst valley. This is Nathaniel's patron and the fey lord behind the de Brune cult; aligned with Ethlenn and antagonist to Umbraeth, but may have own motivations. 
    
    (2) Red hashes show active conflict between Serenveil and Umbraeth. 
    
    (3) Green shows something else - not sure what the name is, but some very ancient fey entity, long predating Umbraeth and Duskmire, maybe a relic of the mythic age or something else weird. allied with no one; territory has shrunk considerably but still retains significant power in heart of ancient domain. barrier to Umbraeth's expansion. vibes are not yet clear but will likely be directly relevant to addermarch adventure. 
    
    (4) Black arrows show incurisions from Darkfall across the Sunset Gate
    
    (5) Blue shows a second ally of Ethlenn, maybe a close ally/underling more directly kind of a splinter realm of Twilight's Grace. 
    
    Questions:
    - Serenveil's territory could extent to the Wisford, or there could be an additonal minor lord on his northern border. Have no opinion here. 
    - Aure valley is a little undefined, although the feywild along the Aure south of Adderfell is likely dangerous and an area of conflict between ancient green entity, Duskmire, blue Ethlenn ally, and Darkfall
