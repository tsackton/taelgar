# Discord DM – 2025-08-10

[2025-08-10 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus: okay, did a little map work this morning. here are three maps - a base map, with the world map overlay, and with regions

[2025-08-10 12:03 PM] rsulfuratus: on the border map:
    (1) March of Andonne
    (2) "core" Refounded Alliance of Aurbez
    (7) unsettled / dangerous Plaguelands, maybe hobgoblins or whatever
    ---
    (3) "the Triangle" - relatively low quality land, rocky soils or something, maybe rough terrain. lightly settled. this is basically your "5" above. Laicon may be on the edge of 3 and 4, perhaps, or maybe just inside 4
    (4) "lowland" Aurbez. this is politically part of the mutual defense pact / communal arrangements of the alliance, but is culturally less driven by Isinguese history and is more of a mix of immigrants. Aursen's Crossing (which perhaps is renamed "Stonebridge" or something after a bridge is built?) is the biggest settlement here. very road- and trade-oriented economy
    (5) unnamed Sentinel Valley. this is very rocky, rough terrain. probably very lightly settled with frontiers types. likely enough traffic on the road for some services to exist, but not many. there is a steep climb at the "entrance" to 5, then a long gradual ascent to the actual pass at the "exit" from 5. here the plateau edge is much less dramatic, and perhaps only marginally higher than the "valley". river here is likely snowmelt only
    (6) Douren highlands. mountain folk, maybe a lot of stoneborn. the south branch of the road ascends to the douren crossing and then follows a broad shoulder for many miles before climbing to the pass.
[2025-08-10 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus: my sense is settlement density is higher in 1 and 2 and 4, and very low in 3/5/6, likely with 3 >` 6 >` 5. 5 might only have a small settlement / traveler's respite something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_St_Bernard_Pass
[2025-08-10 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus: working on editing the obsidian docs. one thing is that the text description are kind of inconsistent with the maps. e.g., "The land is lightly populated, but what people there are mostly live along the two rivers: the [[Masance]] and the [[Aursen]]. " doesn't really fit with region 3 above being lightly populated
[2025-08-10 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus: the text probably makes a bit more sense than the maps. even if there are a couple of small streams / unmarked rivers across the andonne plain, the massance valley is probably much easier to live on than the broad ashlands between the Andonne and the road
[2025-08-10 01:15 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not committed to the text being correct. My thinking though is settlement here is somewhat historically contigent. 
    
    In the 1550s a core group of refugees - about 3000-5000 - some lizardfolk as well as humans - settled on the plateau around the headwaters of the Aursen.
    
    After the stoneborn - hobgbolin war, this settlement attracted some more people from Maseau or scattered folks, mostly with Isingue backgrounds and by 1580 there were maybe 10,000-15,000 people living mostly in the southern part of 2.
[2025-08-10 01:18 PM] rsulfuratus: here is a slightly revised map
![[../_discord_assets/aurbez-hexmap-revised-borders-CDF65.jpg]]
[2025-08-10 01:18 PM] Deciusmus: During the period 1580 - 1640 the area attracts small scale settlement as a refuge from various hobgoblin threats, especially from Maseau but is mostly isolated by the wars on the southern and northern borders - 
    
    so the Andonne Plain/March of Andonne is pretty much entirely unsettled in this period, and almost all the people are living in (2)
[2025-08-10 01:21 PM] Deciusmus: After the 3rd hobgoblin war, the road is reopened, and you start having some settlers building fortified ranches in (1), as well as the Aurbeze expanding into (4) and parts of 3(a) to take advantage of the road
[2025-08-10 01:22 PM] rsulfuratus: basically shifts the center of mass of the marcher castles to the upper masence and the road itself, with few/no people living more than 2 days ride from the road itself, at least to the south (too dangerous)
[2025-08-10 01:22 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that makes sense
[2025-08-10 01:23 PM] rsulfuratus: pushes 3A a bit south into implied rocky terrain between a few smaller streams, and matches with culturally and climatically similar douren valley
[2025-08-10 01:23 PM] rsulfuratus: (3B)
[2025-08-10 01:23 PM] rsulfuratus: in 1750, (4) is part of aurbez politically, although culturally distinct. growth here is largely driven by a stone bridge that replaced the ferry in 1730s ish
[2025-08-10 01:24 PM] rsulfuratus: the masance floods too much so the masance crossing still a shifting ford
[2025-08-10 01:25 PM] rsulfuratus: most other marked rivers are streams that would be no more than a few feet deep and easily fordable except perhaps at the height of the spring flood
[2025-08-10 01:25 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that all makes sense to me
[2025-08-10 01:28 PM] Deciusmus: there should be some lizardfolk in the upper Aursen btw, from the Ausson's miniseries, there was a lizardfolk PC who came from their
[2025-08-10 01:28 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2025-08-10 01:29 PM] rsulfuratus: see the "Marcella" section here: https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier-campaign/scrying-and-spying/scrying-delwath-tollen-downtime/#chardon
[2025-08-10 01:29 PM] Deciusmus: I also think maybe the road opened south to north, not north to south. After the Dunmari won the northern war, the Aurbeze might have started trading south, for horses and maybe grain? and the pass in the south would have been relatively safe once Raven's Hold wasn't a hobgoblin fort
[2025-08-10 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that makes sense actually and would be consistent with stoneborn settlements keeping some areas safe
[2025-08-10 01:30 PM] rsulfuratus: actually the first to open was likely the dunmar ->` aurbez route along the south dunmar road
[2025-08-10 01:30 PM] Deciusmus: Ausson's Crossing (the "Last Inn") is probably the last safe place on the northern edge of the region, not the southern edge
[2025-08-10 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: when it is founded in 1650 or whatever
[2025-08-10 01:31 PM] rsulfuratus: essentially as soon as dunmar wins the northern war
[2025-08-10 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-08-10 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: and  in the recovery after the end of the 3rd hogbolin war Maseau - Sembara reopen the northern part of the road
[2025-08-10 01:32 PM] Deciusmus: but the settlement pattern is probably pretty inspired by that, with the Aurbez "road" settlements being in 4/5 rather than 3 due to historical chance as to where it was safe. The farther northern sections of the plateau were very much seen as less safe and no one came off the plateau
[2025-08-10 01:33 PM] rsulfuratus: i actually think the road past raven's hold is probably the main route for a long time, perhaps even still now. i think the main settlements would be 4/6 actually, more than 5 or 3a/b
[2025-08-10 01:33 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that makes sense
[2025-08-10 01:35 PM] Deciusmus: although 6 is I think more stoneborn than human?
[2025-08-10 01:35 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-08-10 01:35 PM] rsulfuratus: it's not marked on the map but that is where drikod's village is
[2025-08-10 01:36 PM] Deciusmus: how big is each hex on that map
[2025-08-10 01:36 PM] rsulfuratus: 24 miles edge to edge
[2025-08-10 01:36 PM] rsulfuratus: smaller hexes are 6 miles edge to edge
[2025-08-10 01:40 PM] Deciusmus: I'd probably merge 4 and 3b in that map. Settlement has spread west to east from the road, but culturally the whole area between the Douren and the Aursen and along the road in this area is "lowland" Aurbez.
    
    As compared to 3a, north of the Aursen (which might not be trivial to cross, so provides a bit of a barrier to natural growth of settlements) and which is a rocky/less suited to argiculture, and is therefore just not very settled except directly along the road
[2025-08-10 01:40 PM] Deciusmus: but I like "Andonne" crossing and covering the upper Masance
[2025-08-10 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: right, that makes sense Aursen is probably difficult to cross anywhere but the bridge (once ferry), as it is a fast moving and dangerous river
[2025-08-10 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: as is the douren for that matter, so 3b probably sticks to the northwestern banks of the Douren
[2025-08-10 01:42 PM] rsulfuratus: the masance is much easier to cross as it is shallower and slower, it is just prone to flood and shifting sands so where you cross changes from year to year
[2025-08-10 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: Whereas Masance might be wider and rockier and quiet easy to cross in the fall, but raging in the spring floods
[2025-08-10 08:30 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed some stuff. not totally settled yet but have to actually spend some time writing the adventure so...i think i captured the main dynamics though
[2025-08-10 08:30 PM] Deciusmus: just taking a look now
