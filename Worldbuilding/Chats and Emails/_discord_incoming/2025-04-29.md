[2025-04-29 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: do you remember what the cool idea for the moon we had at Backbar was? something about prison for something?
[2025-04-29 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: it was a prison for the gods who had been banished
[2025-04-29 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. what's his name, the god of slavery
[2025-04-29 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: I think we had some other thoughts about how that would make the moon a bit complex, i.e. a prison / entity holding in the bad, but also some degree of the bad leaking out
[2025-04-29 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: and then the big plot thing was that in my game some aberration/far realm entity was trying to break open the moon
[2025-04-29 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: hence the bazaraheal getting some moon people going
[2025-04-29 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: so to speak
[2025-04-29 05:55 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i remember now. i think my idea was to make it ambigious if the moon itself as prisoner was also a "bad god" punished by being made into a prisoner or some kind of hero assigned the task
[2025-04-29 05:55 PM] Deciusmus: right
