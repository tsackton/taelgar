# Discord DM – 2024-09-08

[2024-09-08 01:51 PM] rsulfuratus: In the Addermarch game, Nathaniel wants to be:
    - A human noble from Sembara, from a very rich family
    - The family has a secret connection to a fey cult of some kind
    - The fey cult is associated with Lord Serenveil, Prince of the Vesperwind, Guardian of Twilight's Edge
    
    Nathaniel wants the fey stuff to be kind of mysterious right now. I think probably Lord Serenveil makes the most sense as the lord of one of the border realms near the Sunset Gate, presumably in Sembara. Most likely this would be an associate of Ethlenn, but might make the fey stuff a little unclear as to motives (but can put that off for a while)
    
    The rich Sembaran family with secret fey associations could be just something completely invented but if there is an obvious place for that would be interested in your opinion
[2024-09-08 02:09 PM] Deciusmus: Hrm. Let me think for a minute.
[2024-09-08 02:10 PM] Deciusmus: Are you thinking 1740s or 1725 or what exactly?
[2024-09-08 02:11 PM] rsulfuratus: haven't really settled on a time yet to be honest
[2024-09-08 02:12 PM] rsulfuratus: kind of waiting to see what happens with the campaign
[2024-09-08 02:12 PM] rsulfuratus: but probably leaning towards mid/late 1720s
[2024-09-08 02:16 PM] Deciusmus: Right.
[2024-09-08 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: Ok. A few ideas
[2024-09-08 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: The Asa family. Sarabeth Asa was a magic user of some kind (not defined what) who fought with Cece in the hobgoblin wars and was granted Asineau manor as a reward
[2024-09-08 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: She disappeared into (presumably) the feywild in the 1670s, and her son went looking for her and vanished in the 1710s
[2024-09-08 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: Sarabeth’s wife could have been connected to a larger fey cult
[2024-09-08 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: Or Sarabeth could have been although the family is a bit far west
[2024-09-08 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: But I have very little made up about her, maybe the Asa family is important in the borderlands somewhere
[2024-09-08 02:32 PM] Deciusmus: Having her connected to a fey cult would explain why Umbraeth went after her (if that is what happened haven’t actually decided why she or her son disappeared)
[2024-09-08 02:32 PM] rsulfuratus: Where is Ainseau manor?
[2024-09-08 02:32 PM] Deciusmus: Near Cleenseau
[2024-09-08 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: But the Asa family is from Mosteve Hills
[2024-09-08 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: Lady Sarabeth Asa. I think I've told you her story before? She was from a small village in the Mostreve Hills, near the source of the Clavert River, in the Barony of Brumecliff. When she was granted this manor, a number of refugees from her old village settled here, including my mother. We brought with us the memories of the Wyrdling, from our old village, and still remember their miracle here, each September.
[2024-09-08 02:34 PM] rsulfuratus: Doesn't seem to fit the "rich family" bill very well
[2024-09-08 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: True
[2024-09-08 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: Another idea. Moreau family
[2024-09-08 02:34 PM] Deciusmus: They are the barons of fellburn
[2024-09-08 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: Very little made up about them except there are twins- a brother and sister - the brother panicked during the undead attacks against fellburn and refused to help their father
[2024-09-08 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: When he was trapped outside the walls
[2024-09-08 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: The brother was then exiled and the sister made baron
[2024-09-08 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: Natheniel could be a cousin or something who has gone south trying to find the exiled brother
[2024-09-08 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: (Or I guess he could even be the exiled brother if he wants, I had a name but it was a minor detail so doesn’t have to stick with that name)
[2024-09-08 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: (The father died)
[2024-09-08 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: the adventure motivation is that the fey cult send Nathaniel's character to Addermarch to find out more about this mysterious alchemist in the hills, who is going to be their patron
[2024-09-08 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it is probably easier not to have a family that is tied to events in your 1720 campaign, as it anchors things too much in time and nathaniel is much more vibes based than details based
[2024-09-08 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: A third idea is the de Brune family. They are a wealthy merchant family with connections along the Enst
[2024-09-08 02:40 PM] Deciusmus: I have two people in the Cleenseau region established but they could easily be spread along the whole Enst valley, they are established as having connections up and down the river.
[2024-09-08 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that actually seems pretty ideal
[2024-09-08 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: And actually the fey bad guys in my campaign are about to screw around with Sabine de Brune, the castellan of Valit, so having the family have a secret fey connection might be something id steal
[2024-09-08 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: is eskbridge a manor? free town?
[2024-09-08 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: Not decided
[2024-09-08 02:43 PM] rsulfuratus: that would be a good location for Nathaniel to be from, would be easy to have news of Addermarch there
[2024-09-08 02:44 PM] rsulfuratus: so thinking maybe the de Brune family has holdings there? would require they emerge from the whole lich thing well off as I'm definitely setting this game after the lich events
[2024-09-08 02:44 PM] rsulfuratus: but also could be a different branch of the family in eskbridge or something
[2024-09-08 02:45 PM] Deciusmus: Having the de Brunes be a secret fey cult family based in near Eskbridge (perhaps with several small manors but not the lords of eskbridge itslf) and holdings along the Enst seems perfect
[2024-09-08 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: Eskbridge itself is a relatively small town (2000-3000) and canonically the only bridge over the Enst other than Cleenseau
[2024-09-08 02:47 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. my thinking is an entrepenurial family with holdings along the Enst in Eskbridge could also be fairly wealthy, and would have reason to care about interests upriver in Addermarch, so the fey cult sending a younger son to investigate something would be perfect
[2024-09-08 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: And there were some undead attacks on it and in 1720 the tyrwinghans are massing on the border but it’s been relatively unscathed and is off the main plot
[2024-09-08 02:48 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2024-09-08 02:48 PM] Deciusmus: Catherine de Brune in Cleenseau has been established as one of the wealthier people in the region (Cleenseau)
[2024-09-08 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: okay perfect. not going to develop too much of this yet until i have a better sense of how much detail Nathaniel cares about but will start from here
[2024-09-08 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: fey patron for both Nathaniel and the family cult, is Lord Serenveil, Prince of the Vesperwind, Guardian of Twilight's Edge.
    
    A tall, towering figure, long flowing silver hair, dark skin, dressed in robes that shift colors between deep purples, dusky blues, and silvery grays. Fiery eyes, like fading sunset.
[2024-09-08 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: no details yet exist, but the vibe is likely an ally/lieutenant of Ethlenn guarding the sunset gate
[2024-09-08 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: Presumably even if not a direct lieutenant it would be safe to assume he might have been used as conduit between Ethlenn and my PCs? Specifically I’ve had a few hints dropped here and there that there is a fey creature in the Cleenseau region who has been occasionally dropping hints to Celyn about danger- but in a “don’t want anyone to know I’m here” kind of way
[2024-09-08 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, sure
[2024-09-08 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: I’m wondering if these fey are messengers/servants of Lord Serenveil being sheltered by the be Brunes
[2024-09-08 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: Probably just one actually
[2024-09-08 03:05 PM] rsulfuratus: Nathaniel likes the kind of mysterious / not clearly the "good guys" vibe so might have Serenveil be a bit more complicated than just "lieutenant of Ethlenn" but definitely he would not be allies with Umbraeth. might have his own agenda but be independently wary of Umbraeth for example
[2024-09-08 03:06 PM] rsulfuratus: and of course would not be in conflict with Ethlenn
[2024-09-08 03:06 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah sure
