# Discord DM – 2025-09-08

[2025-09-08 08:20 PM] rsulfuratus: i have lost track of your d&d calendar - is your fey arc still starting in Oct? i've been struggling to keep up with addermarch notes but we did play again on labor and will probably play at least once more in sept, so i've got a bunch more notes about serenvail and morlaith and the "unsettled" region between umbraeth and ethlenn
[2025-09-08 08:34 PM] Deciusmus: The PCs have embarked on a totally unexpected side quest to deal with one of the lich’s henchman, so the fey stuff is probably Dec at this point.
[2025-09-08 08:34 PM] rsulfuratus: after the dunmar campaign is wrapped i'm hoping to have more bandwidth to clean up notes
