# Discord DM – 2025-11-04

[2025-11-04 08:57 AM] rsulfuratus: pushed a little work on the addermarch note. have meetings until ~2 pm or so but will flesh out a bit more later today
[2025-11-04 08:57 AM] rsulfuratus: also working on mostreve hills but if you have name candidates for anything feel free to add them
[2025-11-04 05:19 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed another addermarch update
[2025-11-04 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: also just pushed one
[2025-11-04 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: I merged with yours
[2025-11-04 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: I just added some notes in `%%` on ideas for the undead attacks implications on addermarch
[2025-11-04 05:39 PM] rsulfuratus: the main last thing i want to do with the note is finalize the earl titles
[2025-11-04 06:04 PM] rsulfuratus: what do you think of:
    Earl of Southmarch - southern borders
    Earl of Highfell - Tyrwinghan border highlands
    Earl of Westcliff - western region
    Earl of Adderfell - Adderfell
    Earl of Aurenvale - Aure
[2025-11-04 06:05 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not totally happy with the duplicative -fell ending, fwiw
[2025-11-04 06:07 PM] rsulfuratus: chatGPT suggests:
    Earl of Highrath
    Earl of Highran
    Earl of Highdraen
    
    for replacement for Highfell that has Welsh vibes
[2025-11-04 06:09 PM] Deciusmus: I like all but highfell but I'm not sure about the replacements either
[2025-11-04 06:10 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah still working on that. need to answer an email and cook dinner but if you have ideas i'm all ears
[2025-11-04 06:10 PM] rsulfuratus: going to update doc and push with the others before i step away
[2025-11-04 06:10 PM] Deciusmus: the river is the Tarn, right? that runs from the "aure headwaters" mountains to the west and joins with the Aure?
[2025-11-04 06:10 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2025-11-04 06:11 PM] rsulfuratus: to the east
[2025-11-04 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: so this is basially the earl of "the land north of the tarn, east of the aure, and west of the tyrwinghan ridge"
[2025-11-04 06:12 PM] rsulfuratus: yes. but probably some of the lowlands along the aure are actually in the circuit of the earl of aurenvale
[2025-11-04 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-11-04 06:25 PM] Deciusmus: how about....
    
    "Aure Headwaters Ridge" =>` the Tairnwræth (TIE-ern-wrath)
    "Tyrwingha Ridge" =>` Maerdrin (MARE-drin) Ridge with high peak Garn Tyrn 
    
    Earl of Highfell = Earl of Maerwyn
    Earl of Southmarch = Earl of Tarnmarch or Earl of Tairnvale or Tarnvale
[2025-11-04 06:26 PM] Deciusmus: (although Southmarch is fine)
[2025-11-04 06:32 PM] Deciusmus: Maerval could also work
[2025-11-04 06:32 PM] Deciusmus: Although maybe sounds too much like Marvel
[2025-11-04 06:44 PM] rsulfuratus: i like Southmarch, i think we should keep that. i kind of like having a few more "common english" names
[2025-11-04 06:44 PM] Deciusmus: right, I can see that
[2025-11-04 06:44 PM] Deciusmus: maybe Maerwyn doesn't fit that well then
[2025-11-04 06:45 PM] rsulfuratus: what about Earl of High Tyrn
[2025-11-04 06:45 PM] Deciusmus: oh I like that
[2025-11-04 06:46 PM] rsulfuratus: although that is quite similar to Tarn for the river.....but maybe that is ok
[2025-11-04 06:57 PM] rsulfuratus: though the river name could actually change here, if we wanted
[2025-11-04 07:02 PM] Deciusmus: what about the Branth
[2025-11-04 07:06 PM] Deciusmus: you could have
    
    Branth = the river, joins the Aure
    Maerwyn Ridge, high peak Garn Tyrn
    
    Earl of Southwatch
    Earl of High Tyrn
    
    the Dunfell = Aure headwaters ridge
[2025-11-04 07:07 PM] rsulfuratus: tentatively think that works well. cooking dinner now but will take a closer look in a bit
[2025-11-04 08:33 PM] rsulfuratus: okay, thinking a bit more. 
    
    i like branth a lot for a river. 
    
    maerwyn ridge works well too. might also give a litte more complexity there, and consider maerwyn as basically "White Peaks" literally in Tyrwinghan, and then have the Sembaran gloss Maerwyn Mountains, and then common = White Mountains. though that may be overkill here. this is some of the highest peaks in the mostreve and probably deserves a "mountains" ish name. common usage is probably just Maerwyns anyway. 
    
    Garn Tyrn and Earl of High Tyrn are great. there is also the linguistic complexity option of the "common" gloss on the Earl as Earl of High Tower, and the "tyrwinghan" gloss as Earl of Tyrn Fawr (teern vaur).
    
    i'm not sold on Dunfell. the aure headwaters area is more like the berkshires, dunfell feels like too hilly a vibe maybe?
[2025-11-04 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: chat gpt also suggested
    
    Brackenfell
    Harrowfell
    
    plus a bunch of stuff I didn't like (based on a request to use -fell in the name)
[2025-11-04 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: I am not sold on Dunfell either
[2025-11-04 08:45 PM] rsulfuratus: i'm not sure it needs -fell?
[2025-11-04 08:45 PM] rsulfuratus: what about like "Valehurst Hills"
[2025-11-04 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: it doesn't, I was just playing around with that, to align with Adderfell
[2025-11-04 08:45 PM] Deciusmus: I like that
[2025-11-04 08:46 PM] rsulfuratus: adderfell is built around a massive cliff on the edge of a lake, so i think the -fell comes from taht
[2025-11-04 08:46 PM] Deciusmus: I also like the linguistic complexity of the mountains you've proposed, although I'm not sure I'd bother with the Earl of High Tower / Tyrn Fawr
[2025-11-04 08:48 PM] rsulfuratus: for the southern hills, i might slightly prefer Valenhurst to Valehurst. although -hurst has a bit of a germanic feel and this might have a drankorian name as a lot of the fortifications were built in that era
[2025-11-04 08:49 PM] Deciusmus: I don't really have a preference
[2025-11-04 08:50 PM] rsulfuratus: Valoise Hills
    Valemont Hills
    Valennois Hills
    Valenfray Hills
[2025-11-04 08:52 PM] rsulfuratus: Valemere
[2025-11-04 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: there is a nearby  river  Valmont - although we could change that as well
[2025-11-04 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: so something without Mont is better I think
[2025-11-04 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: Valenfray maybe?
[2025-11-04 08:53 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i like Valenfray
[2025-11-04 08:54 PM] rsulfuratus: there is also a Valcroix but i kind of like having a bunch of Val- names in the Mostreve which can be glossed as the Isinguese-influenced word for hill
[2025-11-04 09:00 PM] rsulfuratus: you'll need to change the name of the river here: 

Caerenad is a small Tyrwinghan town on the road between [[Eskbridge]] and [[Tafolwern]], roughly a three-day's journey south of Eskbridge, and near where the road crosses the [[Enad]], a brook that eventually joins the [[Maerwyn]] just north of the [[Tyrwinghan Road]].
[2025-11-04 09:01 PM] Deciusmus: haha, go ChatGPT with the repeat names 🙂
[2025-11-04 09:01 PM] rsulfuratus: this is why i always make blank staging notes, much easier to find duplicate names when you can just search for the note
[2025-11-04 09:05 PM] rsulfuratus: of course it is a tricky balance as in reality there is way less name duplication in taelgar than would be realistic for an actual world; but having unique names is kinda useful for worldbuliding
[2025-11-04 09:16 PM] rsulfuratus: Pushed name stuff
[2025-11-04 09:17 PM] Deciusmus: what is the ourpose of different staging? i.e. Staging vs Staging/Worldbuilding vs Staging/campaign
[2025-11-04 09:20 PM] rsulfuratus: Random inconsistency on my part mostly
[2025-11-04 09:21 PM] rsulfuratus: I think in an ideal world it is just all in staging and the blank notes get probably tagged and filed
[2025-11-04 09:21 PM] rsulfuratus: At some point there were too many things in staging so I sorted a bit
[2025-11-04 10:29 PM] rsulfuratus: not something i'm going to sort out or think about tonight but with shared `_dm_notes` now there is a bit of reorg of worldbuilding that might be useful, e.g. what is in worldbuilding vs dm_notes and what is in dm_notes that isn't in a campaign folder
[2025-11-04 10:37 PM] Deciusmus: I think basically:
    
    dm notes is brainstorming / raw notes / prep stuff for a campaign or adventure 
    
    Worldbuilding is the same but for the world
    
    Dm notes really just means - this is one of our private info and it’s fine to look at or potentially mine but it effectively has a status of “needswork” and a dm owner of (whoever)
[2025-11-04 10:38 PM] Deciusmus: I think a world building/campaign folder is kinda pointless
[2025-11-04 10:39 PM] Deciusmus: But I’m going to bed so..
