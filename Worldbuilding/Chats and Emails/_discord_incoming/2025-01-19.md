# Discord DM – 2025-01-19

[2025-01-19 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus: not likely to do a ton of taelgarverse cleanup today, but one question. working on cosmology and there are some pages that are hard to develop because there are unresolved questions, e.g., Spiritual Realms. the page is fine as written but the notes have open questions. 
    
    none of our existing tags or frontmatter seem to capture this situation particularly well. there isn't additional information elsewhere in private notes (so no dm_notes), and the public text is correct, if shallow (so no status/needswork tags). status/cleanup doesn't seem correct either because the block is actual invention, not collation of details, etc. 
    
    is this a situation worth capturing, and if so how? possibly just something like status/openquestions?
[2025-01-19 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus: for now I put:
    ``%%` OPEN QUESTIONS `%%`` at the top of pages (so far just Spiritual Realms) that have open questions, and ``%%` TO DO `%%`` at the top of pages that have specific to-do task lists in comments at the end.
[2025-01-19 10:53 AM] Deciusmus: I've been thinking about the same thing around history cleanup that I've been sorta working on
[2025-01-19 10:56 AM] Deciusmus: My idealize end state would be, for these types of big topics (grand sweep of history, religions, cosmology, human cultures, species), something like:
    * The pages in (Cosmology,  Organizations, History) are mostly "in-world", with some DM notes, and contain only canonical or mostly canonical information
    * There are "framework" pages that provide both organizational meta-information (i.e. the "creating new species" document) and a place to capture known stuff in a more bulleted form especially when the known stuff isn't sufficient to create a real page (these would be in Background and should follow dm tag/status tag conventions but are also not as fully canonically as "real" pages)
    * There are brainstorming pages or folders in Worldbuilding for more speculative ideas
[2025-01-19 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: For something like Cosmoslogy, we know that the spirtual realms are:
    * Created in some fashion by "soul stuff" 
    * At least some of them are created by the human divine spark
    * Are related to the afterlife and gods
    
    But the details beyond that are perhaps a bit vauge. That's a good thing to capture in a framework page
[2025-01-19 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus: Sure, I’ve been using campaign none blocks for this a bit. The distinction is I guess between pages where that information is largely complete (usually room for expansion but a settled framework) and where it is not (eg spiritual realms)
[2025-01-19 10:59 AM] Deciusmus: For cosmology, the campaign none blocks might be doing all the work, actually
[2025-01-19 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: for history I was finding that a campaign none block doesn't really work, because what I really want is something that provides a historical framework but doesn't define any actual events at all
[2025-01-19 11:00 AM] Deciusmus: so there is no page to put the campaign none block on
[2025-01-19 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus: Yeah for that I think framework pages are great
[2025-01-19 11:01 AM] Deciusmus: but actually I'm not sure there is really a need, in the spirtual realms page, to tag it specially at all
[2025-01-19 11:02 AM] Deciusmus: Although I'd be tempted to split off some of the specualiation about how different religions see each others divine realms into a separate page - say a Worldbuilding/Spritual Realms - Open Questions or whatever
[2025-01-19 11:03 AM] Deciusmus: Maybe that is the best pattern, is to just create a "Wikipedia talk page" style "Open Questions" document for things where there are really fundamentally unsettled open questions and then link it from the main page
[2025-01-19 11:03 AM] Deciusmus: If we make a Worldbuilding\Open Questions folder it would then be easy enough to even have a MOC page that shows eveything that is backlinked from the Open Questions folder
[2025-01-19 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus: Yeah I kind of like that. We are about to hike to the ledges but I’ll think a bit while we walk and if you feel like doing any reorg I’d be in favor of that proposal
[2025-01-19 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: Ok I'm doing quite a bit of refactoring of the historical framework
[2025-01-19 03:46 PM] Deciusmus: I should probably push what I have, in case you want to look. I'm basically structuring it as
    (a) a "historical framework" page that captures the major sweep of history, in a DM-facing tone (very similar to your "campaign none" DM notes)
    (b) a "open questions" page that lists unresolved issues
    (c) a "discussion" page that includes a lot of background and links to chats that provide rationales for why we ended up with the specific decisions we made as well as older since-discarded thoughts.
    
    This type of structure might only make sense for historical framework, as it is a somewhat unique topic, but am finding the open questions document a very useful way to organize undecided bits
[2025-01-19 03:49 PM] Deciusmus: (I pushed a very draft/wip version)
[2025-01-19 05:36 PM] Deciusmus: Do you have a date for when Chardon was founded?
[2025-01-19 06:04 PM] rsulfuratus: i don't have an exact date. but great library is founded in 688
[2025-01-19 06:05 PM] rsulfuratus: and darba is founded in 377 as a fort on the frontier
[2025-01-19 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: drankorian western wars end between 628 and 647
[2025-01-19 06:07 PM] rsulfuratus: so i'd presume that chardon is sometime between 500 and 650
[2025-01-19 07:15 PM] Deciusmus: I'm pushing a big reorg of Worldbuilding...
    
    I've moved everything to one of 7 folders:
    
    * Brainstorming: Decently formed, relatively non-obsolete brainstorming notes about varous topics.
    * Chats and Emails - raw dumps of discord chats and emails
    * Discussions - "Wikipedia talk" pages for major topics, where we might want to record some of the reasoning behind topics, or have a place to record thoughts
    * Old Documents - relatively large chunks of text that is obsolete enough that it is probably better to rewrite, or at least, requires a major project to rewrite it
    * Open Questions - open question pages, designed to list specific unaddressed questions from other major topics
    * Research and Mechanics - pages that are either real-world research of more about running games and mechanics than worldbuilding (could be a place to share some of my bestiary, for example)
    * Tenative - explicitly for pages that may or may not exist, but would otherwise be "little" pages elsewhere in the tree
[2025-01-19 07:16 PM] Deciusmus: I've also moved a few pages to Background from Worldbuilding that seem like the basis of solid background notes, even if they are not fully canonical, with warning flags.
[2025-01-19 07:19 PM] rsulfuratus: sounds great
[2025-01-19 07:19 PM] rsulfuratus: i like your history setup
[2025-01-19 07:29 PM] Deciusmus: I've moving name lists to Research and Mechanics and sharing a few of my _DM folder ones
