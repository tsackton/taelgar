# Discord DM – 2025-08-05

[2025-08-05 03:03 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a lot of conflicting information about Sembaran history w/r/t the hobgoblin wars and the plaguelands in Obsidian. my understanding is that "Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'mutte" and "Timeline of Sembaran History" capture established canon, and anything that conflicts with the details established in those docs is out-of-date/incorrect
[2025-08-05 03:45 PM] Deciusmus: I’ve been very busy @ work but will take a look shortly. I think that is right
[2025-08-05 05:11 PM] Deciusmus: on a review:
    * "Hobgoblin Movements AFter Cha'mutte" is the canonical overview
    * Timeline of Sembaran History is presumptively canonical, but very little of the details has actually come up in game, so changes that maintain the overall arc are feasible
    
    The articles on the hogbolin wars in Sembara (i.e. First Hobgoblin War + Third Hobgolbin War) and the Cleenseau History Notes page should all be consistent with the above
[2025-08-05 05:14 PM] Deciusmus: The pages for actual hobgoblin clans, i.e. Shattered Ice Clan look a bit outof date
[2025-08-05 05:16 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah I think that was the one I was looking at.
[2025-08-05 05:18 PM] Deciusmus: but that's why it is status/needswork/old
[2025-08-05 05:18 PM] Deciusmus: I think the status tags should be fairly accurate for this type of thing
[2025-08-05 05:20 PM] Deciusmus: The Cleenseau history notes contains most of the details I've introduced in game re: hobgoblin wars
[2025-08-05 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: As far as Aurbez/Andonne, there is a fair bit in gazeteer. I don't have anything more than what is already there. It mostly was made up for Ausson's mini series so could plausibly have changed a bit; has not come up in my Cleenseau game at all
[2025-08-05 05:35 PM] Deciusmus: the notes in Refounded Alliance of Aurbez page are a good start, but the whole 1680 - 1750 historical arc of the area is pretty undeveloped. I haven't used it in my game at all, although I have vague plans to eventually go there
[2025-08-05 05:37 PM] rsulfuratus: okay
[2025-08-05 05:37 PM] rsulfuratus: i missed the status tag
[2025-08-05 05:38 PM] rsulfuratus: i just wanted to check as i have a lot to make up for the final arc but i didn't want to disrupt anything in your game
[2025-08-05 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a few very small updates, mostly to dm tags
[2025-08-05 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: The only real constraint in the whole area from my game perspective is the note I put in the Ausson's Crossing page - basically my players really liked the vibe of the inn and the NPCs from that game, and we all want to eventually have the Cleenseau characters visit the region.
[2025-08-05 05:50 PM] rsulfuratus: why is it Ausson's Crossing, btw?
[2025-08-05 05:50 PM] rsulfuratus: where does the name come from that is
[2025-08-05 05:50 PM] rsulfuratus: there is not an Ausson river is there?
[2025-08-05 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: AUsson is the family name of the propertiors of the last inn
[2025-08-05 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: lots of details of them in the AUsson's Crossing NPCs doc, which is semi-canonical, and a few of them have moved to proper people pages, which is more actually canonical
[2025-08-05 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: the "crossing" is not actually a river crossing - there isn't a river right there - but rather a small crossroads. there is a cart track that leads up towards the plateau that joins the main road
[2025-08-05 05:55 PM] rsulfuratus: looking at that page now. amazing how far AI NPC portraits have come
[2025-08-05 05:55 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2025-08-05 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: where exactly is Ausson's Crossing?
[2025-08-05 06:06 PM] Deciusmus: I couldn't find an actual definition
[2025-08-05 06:06 PM] Deciusmus: since 1680 a town has grown up (see Laicon) around what was originally just an inn
[2025-08-05 06:07 PM] Deciusmus: it is on the road somewhere north of the crossing of the Aursen and south of the crossing of the Masance
[2025-08-05 06:08 PM] Deciusmus: but otherwise was never clearly defined
[2025-08-05 06:09 PM] Deciusmus: the "Travelogue of Etienne of Cassons" (which doesn't have to be strictly canonical) suggests it is 6 days south of the crossing of the Masance
[2025-08-05 06:56 PM] rsulfuratus: didn't see any commits from you, maybe forgot to push?
[2025-08-05 06:57 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2025-08-05 06:57 PM] Deciusmus: just pushed
