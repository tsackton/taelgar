    ## Overview
    Bartoz served as the master smith and de facto quartermaster of [[Torvaine Watch]], keeping the garrison’s arms in fighting shape and the twin gate winches operational. When a cursed [[Serpentine Dagger]] surfaced at the fort, he argued for locking it away and turned to temple steward [[Wulfram]] for guidance. Sir [[Einrik Arpaad]] succumbed to the dagger’s influence anyway, and Bartoz faced him in single combat—mortally wounding his commander but dying of the effort himself. The curse raised Bartoz as an undead guardian until [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], [[Drou]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] destroyed him during [[Addermarch - Session 02]].
[2025-10-27 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus: ## Personality & Traits
    - Plainspoken, dutiful craftsman who prized discipline over rank.
    - Protective of the watch’s rank-and-file, quick to put himself between danger and his comrades.
    - Prudent with magic, preferring divine counsel when the arcane turned sour.
    
    ## Timeline
    - `**`(DR:: 1715-04-28)** – Falls in the smithy after confronting the cursed Sir Einrik; his corpse animates under the dagger’s malign aura.  
    - `**`(DR:: 1715-04-28)** – Destroyed as an undead smith by Fazoth, Drou, and Yvan while they fought to reopen Torvaine’s gates.  
    - `**`(DR:: 1715-04-30)** – Lady [[Elowen Duval]] recounts Bartoz’s sacrifice to the party, ensuring his loyalty is remembered in [[Roscombe]].
    
    ## Relationships
    - **[[Wulfram]]** – Trusted adviser; together they tried to quarantine the dagger for the good of the watch.  
    - `**`Marshal [[Hildo Brask]]** – Collaborated closely on logistics and garrison discipline; Brask’s death spurred Bartoz to confront Einrik.  
    - `**`Sir [[Einrik Arpaad]]** – Commander Bartoz once respected; killing him while cursed haunts the watch’s legacy.
    
    ## Legacy & Hooks
    - Torvaine’s surviving families may seek to recover Bartoz’s masterwork tools—or a journal hidden in the smithy’s rubble.  
    - Rumors in Roscombe cast him as either a tragic guardian or a lingering revenant, inviting future adventurers to set the story straight.
[2025-10-27 10:10 AM] Deciusmus: that's from session notes?
[2025-10-27 10:10 AM] Deciusmus: that's pretty good
[2025-10-27 10:10 AM] Deciusmus: this is just prompting in vs code?
[2025-10-27 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah i just set up the repo in vs code (i used codex not copilot but i think the logic is indentical) and asked: 'Can you help me develop this note (Bartoz). Use session notes to elaborate'
[2025-10-27 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus: thinnest prompt possible
[2025-10-27 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus: previous note was literally just a stub with dm_owner, dm_notes, and tags
[2025-10-27 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus: here is candrosa:

    ![[candrosa-portrait.png|right|400]]
    Candrosa serves as Speaker of the [[Shakun Mystai]], acting as high priest, civic voice, and guardian of [[Karawa]]’s mesa-top temple. He balances political diplomacy with the desperate work of keeping [[Shakun's Protection]] functioning while the borderlands reel from gnoll incursions and otherworldly threats.
    
    ## Overview
    - Oversees rites, initiations, and the weaving of dream-visions that guide mystai acolytes and border sentinels.  
    - Coordinates with [[Elder Kisa]], [[Havdar]], and visiting leaders to align temple magic with the town’s survival needs.  
    - Wields the [[Dreamweaver Staff]], channeling dreams to scout echo realms, inspire allies, and—when his judgment falters—nudge companions toward actions he feels the goddess demands.
[2025-10-27 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus: ## Personality & Outlook
    Pragmatic yet devout, Candrosa carries the weight of Karawa’s safety on little sleep. He is proudly Dunmari and protective of temple secrets, second-guessing himself whenever his caution endangers others. The loss of the [[Heart of Shakun]] exposed a streak of desperate improvisation: he will risk trust, even manipulating visions (as with [[Delwath]] in [[Session 26 (DuFr)]]) if the alternative is watching the mesa crumble. Since the Heart’s recovery he is humbler, quicker to confer with the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], and intent on rebuilding a wider circle of initiates.
    
    ## Role in Recent Events
    - `**`Hyena Rampage (Session 1):** Called on the newly formed Fellowship after the hyena assault, granting them authority to investigate and defend Karawa.  
    - `**`Festival Crisis (Sessions 4–6):** Confided that Shakun’s wards were failing, convened the April 4th council, and chose to remain in the temple when most townsfolk fled.  
    - `**`Siege & Aftermath (Sessions 17–19):** Endured the gnoll siege, coordinated relief with [[Tharandros]] and [[Havdar]], and safeguarded party treasures while new sorties probed the desert.  
    - `**`Heart of Shakun Quest (Sessions 26–29):** Admitted to steering Delwath’s visions, revealed [[Cintra]]’s disappearance with the Heart, and empowered the Fellowship with an abbreviated initiation plus a scroll of sending for the rescue mission.  
    - `**`Restored Web (Session 32):** Led funerary rites for fallen mystai, resumed full initiations once Cintra returned, and orchestrated the [[Feast of Bhishma]] as a public renewal of Shakun’s covenant.
[2025-10-27 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus: ## Relationships & Resources
    - `**`[[Cintra]] & [[Jumi]]:** Reveres the Supreme Oracle and her daughter; their absence forced him into reluctant command, and he now defers to Cintra on strategic uses of the restored Heart.  
    - `**`[[Dunmar Fellowship]]:** Relies on their broad reach—dream-walks with them via the staff, hides contraband relics for their expeditions, and trusts them to speak truths he cannot reveal publicly.  
    - `**`[[Havdar]] & town elders:** Acts as moral authority within councils, tempering Havdar’s militancy with long-term spiritual stewardship.  
    - `**`[[Tharandros]]’ herd:** Maintains a fragile alliance forged through shared defense of the land’s vitality; he keeps the secret of the Heart’s web to a narrow list that now includes the centaur chieftain.  
    - `**`Mystai Initiates:** Mentors acolytes like [[Alesh]] and, more recently, [[Drikod]] and [[Kenzo]], tying their memories into the lattice that powers the mesa wards.
    
    ## Timeline Highlights
    - **1748-03-22:** Summons the party after the hyena raid and begins sharing intelligence on border attacks ([[Session 1 (DuFr)]]).  
    - **1748-04-04:** Oversees the evacuation council and pledges to defend the temple when the populace flees west ([[Session 5 (DuFr)]], [[Session 6 (DuFr)]]).  
    - **1748-04-24:** Briefs the Fellowship on gnoll movements, demonic rumors, and the taboo topic of Shakun’s waning protection ([[Session 18 (DuFr)]]).  
    - **1748-05-23:** Confesses the Heart’s absence, shares the truth of the initiation network, and equips the party for the Wellspring mission ([[Session 26 (DuFr)]]).  
    - **1748-06-01:** Welcomes the Heart back to Karawa and begins coordinating the rebuilding of the warding web ([[Session 29 (DuFr)]]).  
    - **1748-06-18:** Guides the Feast of Bhishma, publicly backing [[Sura|Nayan Sura]]’s push to rally Dunmari forces while quietly tasking the Fellowship with the next leg toward [[Tokra]] ([[Session 32 (DuFr)]]).
[2025-10-27 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus: ## Story Hooks
    - Seek his dream-guided insight on lingering traces of [[Agata]]’s curses or on the Chardonian expeditions skirting Dunmar’s borders.  
    - Broker dialogue between Candrosa and skeptical allies (such as [[Tharandros]] or Tokran officials) to widen the network powering Shakun’s wards.  
    - Investigate whether Candrosa can safely replicate the emergency initiation that gave the Fellowship partial access to the Heart’s lattice—he fears both the cost and the necessity.  
    - Unearth the limits of the Dreamweaver Staff: Candrosa suspects its prior owners left safeguards that a skilled artificer could reactivate, strengthening his ability to watch the echo realms.
[2025-10-27 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus: i think with a little tweaking to the prompt to decide on some headers that make sense (e.g., probably don't need story hooks) this would work really well
[2025-10-27 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus: even gets the dates on the campaignInfo lines correct
[2025-10-27 10:27 AM] Deciusmus: I'm going to have to update my session notes from Kiya with names (she doesn't normally include names in her writeup) and see how it does on them. Very different style than your session notes but...
[2025-10-27 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah my addermarch and dunmar frontier session notes are fairly different in style but the results are pretty similar. kiya's notes have a bit more out-of-world digressions from what i've read but i'd guess that is just a prompting tweak
[2025-10-27 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus: trying now with agent mode to update all of addermarch directory
[2025-10-27 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus: will probably consume all my codex credits but if it works i might upgrade to pro for a month and just blast through everything
[2025-10-27 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus: also this is using the gpt-5-codex model; might get better results with regular gpt-5 which is more optimized for text instead of coding
[2025-10-27 10:33 AM] Deciusmus: I might try it with Copilot with my work account, I have to finish a doc today but my reward for finishing the doc is going to be mess around with Taelgar so if I get it done soon enough...
[2025-10-27 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus: this also worked remarkably well 
    
    "Identify any information about any of the people in the Addermanians directory that is currently in notes in the DM folder, and add a comment (in `%%` tags) to the end of the persons note with the DM information"
[2025-10-27 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus: though i forgot to tell it to also add a link to the DM note the information came from, which would also likely be useful
[2025-10-27 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus: and notably it did not hallucinate DM notes for addermarch NPCs not mentioned in my DM notes
[2025-10-27 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus: the real test - can AI deal with staging notes? 
    
    okay. now, can you look at the notes in Worldbuilding/Staging/Addermarch? these are all stubs that need:
    (a) correct headers, assigning tags based on the details in MOC/status tags and MOC/descriptive tags.
    (b) note details, following the general outlines from other notes of the same type
    (c) DM notes, wrapped in `%%` tags and citing the source of information from the DM directory
    
    add links where appropriate throughout, except in yaml headers, which should not have links.
    
    add campaignInfo to people only.
    
    rely primarily on session notes to create details. do not invent beyond what can be inferred from session notes. secondarily, use other notes that mention the page to add information.
    
    skip any notes with names that start and end with tildes (~)
[2025-10-27 12:21 PM] Deciusmus: I'm just using GPT 5 mini at the moment but it is doing a decent job of finding unnamed people in session notes and asking me who they are and then fixing
[2025-10-27 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: so messing around a little more. it is not quite good enough to just dump straight into taelgarverse, but i think it can get about 90% of the way to a functional note, including metadata, with agent mode. gpt-5-medium performed a little better than gpt-5-mini, but the main difference was missing notes (e.g., it would say "there is no information on this person in session notes" when there was)
