# Discord DM – 2024-07-15

[2024-07-15 09:35 AM] rsulfuratus: About to go to a meeting but a morning thought: before settling too strongly on writing systems and alphabets, it might be worth thinking a bit about the role of magic. what language are scrolls and spellbooks "written" in, for example? 
    
    In general though, I think that humans creating/receiving a "standard" alphabetic writing system along with the "Human" language (which becomes Common) on Hkar makes total sense, which then evolves into the modern day alphabets. I think roughly the time depth is right to have everything as closely related as Greek-derived alphabets (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, maybe some runic alphabets like Furthak). But no Arabic/Hebrew style alphabets where vowels are not letters, for example, which are an older divergence.
    
    Might think a bit more later today when meetings are over a little more about "original Fey", "original Titan", and "original Draconic" which woudl be the three main "magic alphabets" in a sense. Elementals feel different, and the "outer planes" languages (celestial, infernal, etc) I think should be radically different.
[2024-07-15 09:37 AM] Deciusmus: I was also thinking a bit about the "why". Why do fey or titans or dragons develop a written language at all?
[2024-07-15 09:37 AM] Deciusmus: I'm not totally convinced, for example, that dragons bother to develop a specific mechanism designed to encode their draconic thoughts on paper. Is draconic writing really a language at all?
[2024-07-15 09:38 AM] Deciusmus: Or is it say, a way of encoding magic? Did/do dragons create monuments with their names on them, in their own language?
[2024-07-15 09:39 AM] Deciusmus: These questions don't specifically need answers for dragons, as my only real goal is to figure out what fey writing is like
[2024-07-15 09:40 AM] Deciusmus: But the same questions apply to titans and fey. Do titans write letters to each other? It feels to me like in the age of myth, probably not. Is anyone thinking about recording "events" for the "future" when time itself is not stable?
[2024-07-15 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus: my assumption is this has to do with magic. the original titan language is rune magic, for example. i guess draconic is probably in some sense the language of arcane magic
[2024-07-15 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus: I think the fey, though, are probably doing things like writing stories. writing in the mythic age doesn't develop for normal human reasons, since the fey don't care about tracking grain harvests and writing memorials on tombs or decrees and edicts
[2024-07-15 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus: but, they are probably writing novels
[2024-07-15 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: Right that all makes sense to me
[2024-07-15 10:47 AM] Deciusmus: But it suggests that the draconic language might not have any direct relationship to human alphabets or even to a further mechanism dragons might develop to say write orders to kobolds in draconic
[2024-07-15 10:47 AM] Deciusmus: I like the idea that fey writing originally developed to write stories, plays, poems, etc
[2024-07-15 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus: i was actually contemplating making draconic in some form, or at least the draconic alphabet, the language of spellbooks. or maybe arcane spells in general. need to think a bit more
[2024-07-15 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus: no one has played a wizard for any length of time in Taelgar
[2024-07-15 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus: Eric has fiddled a bit with Seeker being interested in giants because of the connection to dwarven runic magic, though
[2024-07-15 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: Right, sure, I find that idea interesting and plausible but just not really related to why fey develop writing
[2024-07-15 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-07-15 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: I think there probably doesn't need to be a "Grand Unified Theory" of why the children of the divine developed writing
[2024-07-15 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: for the fey specifically, I would definitely say that in the age of myth, the archfey invented writing specifically as an art form.
[2024-07-15 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: And so making something up about fey ->` elvish doesn't necessarily have to have any impact on giants ->` dwarves or dragons ->` spellbooks
[2024-07-15 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus: this probably makes the sylvan script quite complicated. maybe like japanese in a sense, where you have simultaenously logographcs and a syllabary
[2024-07-15 10:50 AM] Deciusmus: Right, or Eygptian hieroglyphics.
[2024-07-15 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: But also, I was trying to brainstorm ways the fey might have used it as an art form to make it feel a bit non-human...
    
    For example, what is there was an element of fey writing that meant something different depending on the time of day (i.e. place in the feywild) you read it? So to properly interpret fey writing you need to know *where* it was supposed to be read
[2024-07-15 10:52 AM] Deciusmus: Or, some type of tonal indicator, a note or glyph representing a note, which provided an emotional overlay on the writing, which might change the meaning of words
[2024-07-15 10:53 AM] Deciusmus: Or even some type of magical element, where it is hard to write properly without the correct magical sense, because there are some logograms that mean different things depending on the magic used to write them
[2024-07-15 10:54 AM] Deciusmus: Kiya who has a hobbiest interest in ancient Egypt, was telling me about an aspect of hieroglpyhics that seemed interesting...
    
    >` The fun thing about hieroglyphics, by the way, is the determinatives, which are basically non-pronounced ideographic characters at the end of words to tell you what kind of word they are.  So, like, a motion-verb might end in `[walking feet]` so you know how to read it, or a name might end `[figure of man]`, `[figure of god]`, or `[figure of dog]` so you knew if someone was talking about a guy named Anup (Anubis), the god Anubis, or a dog named Anubis.
    >` If a determinative is specific enough sometimes it's just straight-up used as an ideogram.
[2024-07-15 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus: yes, I think the "pure" form of sylvan writing would be very hard for humans to read, or really for non-fey to read. i think the emotional/tonal overlay is the right direction, where the meaning of a glyph changes depending on how the person who wrote it was feeling, and to properly understand it you have to read it in the feywild, where the emotional resonance of the glyph can be allowed to change your emotions as you read
[2024-07-15 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus: building on Kiya's point, proper "full sylvan" probably has magically encoded emotional determinatives
[2024-07-15 10:55 AM] Deciusmus: Right, I like that
[2024-07-15 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: but, that means you can't fully understand proper "high sylvan" or whatever outside the feywild, most likely
[2024-07-15 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: there would also be something like "low sylvan" where the emotional determatives are written out
[2024-07-15 10:56 AM] Deciusmus: (For in-game interest, I'd probably assume Detect Magic lets you sense them)
[2024-07-15 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus: sure, that's a good idea
[2024-07-15 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: I was thinking why have low sylvan? When fey writing first developed, there was no "feywild" vs "material" plane and everyone could just understand the emotional determiniatives
[2024-07-15 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus: well, sometimes the fey presumably need to write something that will pass out of the feywild
[2024-07-15 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: Then, after the Riving, when the fey first thought it was useful to communicate with others, they just adopted elvish
[2024-07-15 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus: ah, sure, okay, that might make more sense
[2024-07-15 10:57 AM] Deciusmus: which might be, after all, just a simplified form of sylvan anyway
[2024-07-15 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus: More in a bit, have a meeting now
[2024-07-15 11:04 AM] Deciusmus: I basically like the idea of somewhat modelling on ancient egyptian...
    
    1) sylvan is a complex logo-syllabic script with 1000+ glyphs and emotional/magic determiniatives that make it hard to write, as well as a strong culture of "presentation" concerns (i.e. some fey would care how the written page physically looked, since it was developed for art anyway)
    2) elvish evovled from sylvan in the same way demotic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)) evolved from hierglyphics
[2024-07-15 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that description of sylvan is basically in the right direction
[2024-07-15 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the relationship between sylvan and elven scripts might require a bit more thought. i'm not sure it makes sense for elvish to have really a feeling of "evolved", if it was given to the elves by Elmerica. 
    
    I kind of feel like one of two paths makes sense:
    1) after the riving, a simplified fey script develops that is more of a syllabary and is somewhat easier for non-fey to read and write, and preserves meaning better across planes. this is never really a focal concern of the fey, and when it is picked up and formalized by the elves it basically just becomes elvish. 
    2) after the riving, when the elves are created, Elmerica gives them language and writing, basically drawing from and simplifying Sylvan into a syllabary in the process
[2024-07-15 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus: the distinction is maybe subtle, the difference would just be largely about whether elvish script and proper "full" sylvan are related by fey choices or by divine choices
[2024-07-15 12:06 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I like the 2nd
[2024-07-15 12:07 PM] Deciusmus: And to just expand, the fey then readopt the Elmerica-created writing system to use when they realize that the elves on the material plane can't really read what they are writing, due to lack of seeing the magic...
    
    Although many elves can in fact natively detect magic, so perhaps it is more later, when the fey want to communicate with the non-elves, that this really starts to happen
[2024-07-15 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i think the basic idea would be just that full sylvan script doesn't easily translate to the material plane. in the feywild, the determantives are obvious (if, sometimes, dangerous to read because they can put the unsuspecting reader into the mindset of the writer, which can theoretically mean a poem written by a powerful archfey might function like suggestion or charm person or other enchantment magic)
[2024-07-15 12:13 PM] Deciusmus: oh, I like that
[2024-07-15 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus: but in the material plane, it requires special effort to read (maybe not just detect magic, but perhaps if you have the fey touched feat, or are a fey ranger subclass, or have an archfey patron, etc)
[2024-07-15 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus: (would still be dangerous to read on the material plane)
[2024-07-15 12:14 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-07-15 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus: (if you can read it)
[2024-07-15 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus: so when the fey want to write for more "standard" reasons - send letters to followers on the material plane, etc - they adopt the Elmerica-derived elvish script to write
[2024-07-15 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus: in part because the main people they are communicating with are elves
[2024-07-15 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus: but in part because the reason for writing changes
[2024-07-15 12:16 PM] Deciusmus: right, I like that
[2024-07-15 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus: i would probably lean into the magic aspect of the original sylvan alphabet, and make it very easy to read, like it wants to be understood, but very hard to write
[2024-07-15 12:17 PM] Deciusmus: (Although I would also suppose that fey often actually just not only write to their follows in the elvish alphabet, but in the elvish - or drankorian - or tyrwinghan - language itself, right?)
[2024-07-15 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, right, just many of their first followers were elves
[2024-07-15 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus: mechanically, i might consider:
    (1) anyone who knows sylvan knows how to speak sylvan, how to read/write sylvan using elvish script, and how to read sylvan using the sylvan script, but not how to write the sylvan script
    (2) the slyvan script can, in theory, be used to write any language, and it always somehow 'makes sense' to readers who can read that language in its native alphabet
[2024-07-15 12:20 PM] Deciusmus: I think there is a question of - do the fey usually know lots of other languages? Is some powerful fey writing an order to an elvish follower in sylvan, but in the elvish script? or are they just writing in elvish?
[2024-07-15 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus: probably some of both, i think
[2024-07-15 12:21 PM] Deciusmus: The alternative idea I just had was that actually writing sylvan in other alphabets wasn't developed by the fey at all, but by fey-adjacent people (elves, tyrwinghans) as a way to try to communicate/understand/discuss sylvan
[2024-07-15 12:23 PM] Deciusmus: Especially if the sylvan script is magical and "Wants" to be read
[2024-07-15 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: The fey just write in sylvan. Who cares after all? They can do it easily, and the elves and humans seem to be able to read it, and if some humans who read a fey love poem actually fall in love a little bit, well, good, that's the point of writing a love poem
[2024-07-15 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: It's the humans/elves who start writing sylvan in other alphabets, to both be able to write it and to avoid the dangers of reading sylvan itself
[2024-07-15 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus: in a meeting now
[2024-07-15 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus: one sec
[2024-07-15 12:25 PM] Deciusmus: take your time, I gotta go fix a few bugs anyway
[2024-07-15 01:12 PM] rsulfuratus: so, summarizing, here is my take:
    - The fey invent the language Sylvan, and the corresponding complex logo-syllabic script, during the mythic age, primarily as an art form, used to write poetry, songs, and stories. The script itself encodes this concern: it uses magical/emotional determinatives to communicate the emotional state of the writer, which changes the meaning of glyphs and as a secondary effect has a magical enchantment effect that is weaker or stronger depending on the magical power of the writer
    - When Elmerica creates the elves, they `*`(actually not entirely sure about the gender or lack thereof of the Elven firstborn) also give the elves language (Elvish), and a writing system (the Elvish script), that is derived from the Sylvan script, but converted to a syllabary and stripped of the magical determinatives. The reasons for using the Sylvan script, as opposed to just invented something out of thin air, are left undetermined for the moment, just matters that this is what happened. 
    - Over time, as the fey begin to interact with other people (non-fey), a few changes happen. First, the fey decide that sometimes writing is useful for things other than art, and that sometimes the magical weight of the fey script is not actually desirable. Second, some non-fey learn the Sylvan tongue (especially, early on, elves), but do not know how, or are not able, to write in the Sylvan script. This leads to the rapid development of an orthography for expressing Sylvan in the Elvish script
    - The fey also, around this time, start to learn other languages. Sometimes they just write in the other language's script, but they also rapidly adapt the Sylvan script to other spoken languages, and the magic of the enchantment generally carries the meaning well enough
[2024-07-15 01:16 PM] rsulfuratus: this leads to the following modern day things:
    - the Sylvan language, spoken by the fey, and written in either the (magical) sylvan script, or more typically in the Elvish script. most people who speak sylvan (or, anyway, most non-fey) cannot write in the sylvan script, but can read sylvan in both sylvan and elvish scripts, and write sylvan in elvish. The orthography of writing Sylvan in Elvish was largely invented by the elves as a way to write Sylvan, but functionally adopted by many fey, and probably involved some back and forth and probably is not totally standardized (e.g., like medieval english spelling), but for game-mechanical purposes this is probably irrelevant.
    - the Sylvan script, originally used for writing the Sylvan language but since adapted to many other languages, which carries emotive weight, potential magic, and wants to be read so is usually understandable to speakers of the language
    - the Elvish script, which is derived via Elmerica's intervention from the Sylvan script, was originally used to write Elvish, but is also the typical script that non-fey use to write Sylvan
[2024-07-15 01:26 PM] rsulfuratus: left undecided / open to feedback:
    - is there an orthography of writing/reading sylvan in other scripts, that is does somewho who knows Sylvan automatically also know the Elvish script, or would they typically write Sylvan transliterated to e.g. Drankorian or Eastros alphabets? I'm fairly open either way to this. There are plenty of examples of real-world languages written in multiple scripts so totally plausible either way. I think the fey would never use anything other than Sylvan or Elvish scripts for written communication among themselves, though. However, a fey who wanted to write a message to a Tyrwinghan human could plausibly write Sylvan (in Sylvan, or Elvish, or Drankorian script, depending on their goals); write in Tyrwinghan or Common or Sembaran, using the standard alphabet; or write in Tyrwinghan/Common/Sembaran in Sylvan, if the magic was the goal
    - mechanically, what does the language "Sylvan" imply. this would obviously depend on the game, but I would typically assume either: (a) speak Sylvan, write and read Sylvan with Elvish script; (b) speak Sylvan, write/read Sylvan with orthography of native language. But generally taking the language proficiency "Sylvan" should not generally give special ability to write Sylvan scripts.
[2024-07-15 01:33 PM] Deciusmus: A few quick comments, leaving aside the game mechanical for a moment.
    
    I'm not totally sold on "you can write any language with the Sylvan script" and have it be understood. I'm more wondering if it should be something like: "the fey learned to add their emotional/magical determinatives to other orthographies".
    
    Alternatively, it seems like it would be plausible to say that sylvan isn't really a specific set of glyphs at all, but something more magical than that, and its connection to a specific language kinda vague
[2024-07-15 01:34 PM] Deciusmus: It seems weird to me to think that say the character:
![[../_discord_assets/image-A7681.png]]
[2024-07-15 01:34 PM] Deciusmus: is somewhat clearly understand as the sound "Th" in drankorian
[2024-07-15 01:34 PM] rsulfuratus: Ah yeah actually I like the “fey can add determinatives to other scripts”
[2024-07-15 01:35 PM] Deciusmus: Which implies that you don't need any special magic or anything to read sylvan writing. (although if you don't know the sylvan language, the fey would have to have been writing in your language)
[2024-07-15 01:36 PM] Deciusmus: but of course you should probably also be *cautious* about reading fey writing
[2024-07-15 01:37 PM] Deciusmus: It's *writing* slyvan that is quite the trick for a non-fey to learn
[2024-07-15 01:37 PM] rsulfuratus: I think it is a little more complicated. I guess what I was going for with the “want to be read” is two-fold. One, I think that it is probably relatively obvious visually when you are looking at “get writing”. Maybe a powerful archfey can disguise it, but you don’t typically pick up a random poem and then realize only after reading it that you are now charmed.
[2024-07-15 01:38 PM] rsulfuratus: Second, the fey script gives a lot of power to the writer. A fey missive can make itself subtly easier or harder to understand as the writer desires
[2024-07-15 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: So maybe it isn’t exactly that the Sylvan script is used to write other languages, but it is also not exactly the “normal” script, both visually and practically
[2024-07-15 01:40 PM] Deciusmus: Right. Agree with that as well. I actually think there are probably two different things going on here....
    
    1) Fey writing, as a thing, is just somewhat magical, whatever language they are writing in, if they want it to be. So a fey can of course write a perfectly normal letter in Tyrwinghan. But they also can "embellish" it in some way, which would with some powerful/rare exceptions be obvious, which would give it an emotional power/magical spin
[2024-07-15 01:41 PM] Deciusmus: 2) The writing system for Sylvan, that the fey created in the age of myth, is so intertwined with the idea of magical fey writing that it can't be understood without the embellishments
[2024-07-15 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: So it goes something like....
    
    The fey develop this magical form of written communication, where there are embedded emotions in the words, and their written language never disambiguates between certain concepts without the embedded emotion
    
    Over time, you get:
    a) a non-magical and simplified version of the fey writing (Elvish) which just represents phonemes/syllables like normal writing systems
    b) fey learning to use their writing tricks on other languages
[2024-07-15 01:45 PM] Deciusmus: Which is, I think, kinda what you were saying as well?
[2024-07-15 01:46 PM] rsulfuratus: Yeah I think that’s perfect
[2024-07-15 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: One idea from Kiya.... True fey writing in Sylvan might be non-linear, i.e. the central concept of a poem might be inscribed large and in the middle, and additional words and context in concentric circles around it
[2024-07-15 02:04 PM] Deciusmus: Which might then in turn lead to Tyrwinghan art sometimes replicating the appearance of fey writing, without the magic
[2024-07-15 02:33 PM] rsulfuratus: I like that
[2024-07-15 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: I have a few comments / edits / idea on the language doc, btw, it might be simpler to just post thoughts in Discord but could also add comments and push if you prefer the tracking aspect
[2024-07-15 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: either
[2024-07-15 02:41 PM] rsulfuratus: Re: "_Real world analog_: Undefined. Very few names or place names would be written in Common." I have tended to somewhat arbitrarily "translate" place names into effectively Common, to give a few familar anchors for things. The two examples that come to mind immediately are "Raven's Hold" and "Copper Hills", but also e.g. Green Sea, Endless Ocean, Sea of Storms, Sentinels. I think it is actually nice to sprinkle these in occasionally for practical and flavor reasons, especially if they have other, language-specific names (e.g., Labkah, Inalas for Sentinels)
[2024-07-15 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: I don't think this needs to be explicitly called out especially in a player facing language doc
[2024-07-15 02:42 PM] rsulfuratus: But my headcannon for why I don't bother making "native" names for everything is this is the Common translation
[2024-07-15 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: I like that
[2024-07-15 02:43 PM] rsulfuratus: I might make a note to this effect in the language doc as that will be the primary reference for practical naming of things
[2024-07-15 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: _Real world analog_: Modern English. Place or personal names written out (i.e. [[Copper Hills]] or [[Sentinel Range]] or [[Copperharps]] or [[Gemcrafters]]) should usually be read as being Common, in world.
[2024-07-15 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: re: "_Alphabet_: Drankorian is written using the Drankorian alphabet". I'm not positive actually that there is a good reason for the Drankorian alphabet and the pre-Downfall urban Hkaran alphabet to be different. Maybe this doesn't really matter so much in practice, but there is a very close culturally continuity here that is maybe not precisely reflected in the documents. From the Drankorian point of view, of course, this is Drankorian, and especially from a present-day view
[2024-07-15 02:46 PM] Deciusmus: I was inclined to preserve the possibility of old and mysterious Hkaran writing
[2024-07-15 02:46 PM] rsulfuratus: but, I think that would be older
[2024-07-15 02:46 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm not positive...
[2024-07-15 02:47 PM] Deciusmus: maybe a `%%` note `%%` indicating something like:
    
    `%%` Drankorian is closely related, or identical to, the written language in Hkar in the years before the Downfall, but the exact variety of Hkaran writing and the evolution of Hkaran writing systems is explicilty left undefined here `%%`
[2024-07-15 02:50 PM] rsulfuratus: On the Drankorian language family, I'm not fully convinced that Sembaran should be thought of as a creole. I would actually potentially put Sembaran in the Eastros family, and have Sembaran and Tollish share a grammar but use vocabulary that is almost entirely derived from Drankorian. So they are kind of understandable if you concentrate to Isinguese or Cymeans, but like all the sentences might be backwards or something
[2024-07-15 02:50 PM] rsulfuratus: but they would not really be understandable to Skaer or others as the vocabulary is quite different
[2024-07-15 02:50 PM] Deciusmus: That works for me
[2024-07-15 02:51 PM] Deciusmus: like if 85% of the words in English were French loan words
[2024-07-15 02:51 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, exactly
[2024-07-15 02:52 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, I like that a lot actually
[2024-07-15 02:53 PM] rsulfuratus: I think this fits with the history of the Mostreve hills being a long-standing political divide (e.g. even at its largest immediately pre-Great War Sembara never claimed kingship over Isingue) and establishes the Insiguese refugee community as a little bit more distinct, as they likely have a non-mutually-intelligible language as well as a sharped cultural break
[2024-07-15 02:53 PM] rsulfuratus: if you agree I'm going to modify the language doc to fit this
[2024-07-15 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: and it explains why I have such a random mix of French + English names, but with a lot more French along the southern borders
[2024-07-15 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I like it
[2024-07-15 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: but hold on let me push before you modify
[2024-07-15 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: I just updated the Common & Drankorian bits as the above
[2024-07-15 02:54 PM] Deciusmus: done
[2024-07-15 02:55 PM] Deciusmus: I also changed the Hkaran Alphabet to be:
    
    `*`Alphabet*: Unknown. `%%` In general the immediate pre-Downfall Hkaran writing is very similar to Drankorian, but the exact evolution is left undetermined, and any Hkaran alphabets are lost anyway `%%`
[2024-07-15 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: my other thoughts are a little more vague. currently none of the northros languages use a "northros script"
[2024-07-15 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: have a meeting now more later
[2024-07-15 02:57 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I didn't like the northros alphabets
[2024-07-15 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: that should probably change
[2024-07-15 03:13 PM] rsulfuratus: i was going to suggest for northros, we could lean into it and argue that the original northros language was generally not written, which might push back the date of the first human migrations quite far into early Hkar (but, not necessarily a bad thing, given the quite distinct religious traditions) and would imply a few things about early hkar (e.g., lack of widespread literacy, since there is a writing system in place at the creation of humans - but if the ancestors of the northerners were largely illiterate it could work)
    
    alternatively, i think that at least Deno'qai and Old Zimkovian should probably share an alphabet. Mawar probably adopts Drankorian writing as it is fairly culturally distinct from the northern folk religion cultures
[2024-07-15 03:13 PM] rsulfuratus: don't have strong feelings either way, could leave that undetermined for now. there is nothing particularly canonically decided about Deno'qai writing systems
[2024-07-15 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: a few more random thoughts:
    - I think potentially Chardonian has overtaken Drankorian as a scholarly language these days, and probably fewer and fewer scholars of the past two generations bother to learn Drankorian. It would not be quite as unusual as, say, learning Latin or Greek today in the real world, but it isn't anything like the prevalence of Latin in the Middle Ages. I think especially Mos Numena, without a real hierarchy or organization, is typically propogated in the local languages, and so there isn't a strong religious force to maintain a non-spoken language
[2024-07-15 03:29 PM] rsulfuratus: (pre Great War there is some impetus to maintain Drankorian as a kind of diplomatic language among the disparate city states of the west coast, but post Great War Chardonian becomes dominant)
[2024-07-15 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: - it is a bit weird to have Old Zimkovan as a Northros language and Zimkovan as an Eastros language, primarily from a naming point of view. shouldn't it be called something else, by analogy to e.g. Old English vs Brittonic?
[2024-07-15 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: On Old Zimkovan vs Zimkovan: yes, definitely
[2024-07-15 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: Old Zimkovan should really be in ~~
[2024-07-15 03:39 PM] Deciusmus: I was also planning on renaming most of the kestavo names to be more Arabic/Maltese sounding, the vibe being basically that the Zimka people, speaking an Eastros language, effectively reclaimed the cultural inheritance from the ~OldZimkovan~
[2024-07-15 03:39 PM] Deciusmus: but the gods names didn't change much
[2024-07-15 03:41 PM] Deciusmus: Sorta like if the Welsh & AngloSaxons had never converted to Christianity, and then during the Norman Conquest, lots and lots of Anglo-Saxons ended up in Wales where they then consciously reidentified themselves with the "British"
[2024-07-15 03:41 PM] Deciusmus: in opposition to the "French"
[2024-07-15 03:42 PM] Deciusmus: You might end up with a Wales speaking mostly English and an England speaking mostly French where the differences between Britons+English kinda fades away
[2024-07-15 03:43 PM] rsulfuratus: putting Sembaran and Tollish in Eastros works really well, it gives the Drankorian languages (diverging for ~700 years) a much simpler structure with only four languages, more or less (perhaps plus 1-2 more on the west coast), while the Eastros family (diverging for 2000+ years) has a lot more complexity
[2024-07-15 03:47 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed changes moving Sembaran/Tollish and adding a few notes here and there
[2024-07-15 03:48 PM] rsulfuratus: also reordered to put ancient languages first that is where most of the diffs come from
[2024-07-15 03:51 PM] Deciusmus: I think that looks good.
[2024-07-15 03:52 PM] Deciusmus: Before I publish for my players I'm just going to change the ~OldZimkovan~ and Deno'qai alphabets to "Unknown". With `%%` note `%%` on thinking here
[2024-07-15 03:54 PM] rsulfuratus: have a bit of work to do but I'm going to read through once more in about 30 minutes, assume you are not publishing immediately
[2024-07-15 03:55 PM] Deciusmus: tomorrow or late tonight at the earliest
[2024-07-15 03:55 PM] Deciusmus: I'm just proscratinating from a large code review I don't really feel like, but I have to force myself to do it soon 🙂
[2024-07-15 03:56 PM] Deciusmus: As a random thought, Goblin/Hobgoblin might be a good place for the Chinese idea of written language being easy to understand across dialects but spoken language note, really
[2024-07-15 04:10 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a few minor tweaks and  big doc on Sylvan Writing that is just a raw dump of this conversation that needs to be cleaned up
[2024-07-15 05:27 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a few edits. almost all just minor typos and cleanup. substantive changes are basically (a) change lizardling alphabet to unknown, as I'm not convinced they shouldn't have their own form of writing; (b) change the Free Orc writing system to be based on elvish script, to reflect their feywild heritage; (c) add a comment to extra-planar languages to indicate they can be fairly easily learned with the appropriate blessing from a native of the plane (to reflect, e.g. the fact that many elemental-themed characters lkely know primordial, even if it is not something you pick up with your background)
[2024-07-15 05:38 PM] rsulfuratus: also pushed some notes/comments on extraplanar and exotic languages, but just in comments, nothing really canonical
[2024-07-15 06:43 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a cleaned up sylvan language page
[2024-07-15 06:43 PM] Deciusmus: or ather sylvan writing page
[2024-07-15 07:17 PM] Deciusmus: two last changes
    * I moved Giant to "Exotic Tongues" to make that the section for everything outside the Elder Folk & Children of the Void Mind
    *  I added a campaign:none merfolk, although if you have some notes on the merolk language would make sense to at least put what we know there and change to campaign dufr
[2024-07-15 09:33 PM] Deciusmus: I’ve stated a little side project trying to reorganize the many different brainstorming docs out the broad historical outlines of taelgar into a single more canonical doc. Just fyi
[2024-07-15 09:35 PM] Deciusmus: At the moment it’s mostly just moving stuff around. So far there are a couple of open questions:
    
    1. Were the orcs created at the same time as the elder folk (as the main background history of Taelgar says) or were they created at the same time as humans and hobgoblins (as a mythic history brainstorming doc suggests)
[2024-07-15 09:37 PM] Deciusmus: 2. Should anything at all about the southerners (other than “they existed” be considered canonical?) I’d prefer to leave them out except as a “the southerners existed what happened to them tbd”
[2024-07-15 09:37 PM] Deciusmus: 3. Is there a firm date for the creation of humans?
[2024-07-15 09:39 PM] rsulfuratus: For (1), I don't think there is a canonical answer. I haven't spent much time on the history of the non-People of the Rainbow orcs. Either is plausible, and the metaphysics of how exactly the Void Mind and the Despairs etc work is not clear. There is a certain logic to having all the "elder folk/children of embodied divinities" appear at the same time, but I'm not sure there is a need to be fully committed to parallelism
[2024-07-15 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: I imagine this is not really known even among elven scholars -- even if the orcs were created early, they didn't really have a big impact until later -- so probably reasonable to leave it as unknown until more detail is needed. 
    
    Certainly the people of the rainbow don't really maintain tales or myths from their chained days, and so for them their creation story is about the Cloudspinner
[2024-07-15 09:41 PM] rsulfuratus: For (2), per Milo's story, rumors of them surely exist in Chardon among other places. So it is more "they exist but no one really goes there because it is too hard so news is all garbled"
[2024-07-15 09:42 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I can just mention both possibilities with a “who knows what really happened”. Makes sense to me
[2024-07-15 09:42 PM] rsulfuratus: For (3), I think there should be but I'm not quite sure what it should be. Something like 1500-1700 maybe?
[2024-07-15 09:43 PM] Deciusmus: There are dates ranging for 1500-2400 in various docs
[2024-07-15 09:44 PM] Deciusmus: I was leaning toward something like 1750-1850
[2024-07-15 09:45 PM] Deciusmus: 1850 gives ~2200 years of human culture before the downfall which feels about right
[2024-07-15 09:47 PM] Deciusmus: Be a little earlier might also make sense? 1550 = 2500 years
[2024-07-15 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: the religious history of taelgar doc has I think the most canonical thinking about pre-Downfall humanity, through a religious lens
[2024-07-15 09:48 PM] rsulfuratus: (as an aside, did we ever finalize Deno'qai funerary traditions?)
[2024-07-15 09:50 PM] rsulfuratus: in any case, for human history, I think that the "era of personal deities" feels like it could easily be 1000 years of relative stasis. not much arcane magic development, not much urbanization, pretty idyllic
[2024-07-15 09:51 PM] rsulfuratus: for dating, the only real information is that the philosopher's guild suggests the binding stones are more than 3000 years old
[2024-07-15 09:52 PM] Deciusmus: The only real thing we have is the  “traditions around death” doc
[2024-07-15 09:53 PM] rsulfuratus: the events in described the philosopher's letter probably take place in the early pantheonic days, or perhaps the small gods era, hard to say precisely. but that puts that kind of transitory period at or before say ~2800
[2024-07-15 09:55 PM] rsulfuratus: do we have dates for mariner migrations?
[2024-07-15 09:55 PM] rsulfuratus: tollen is founded 3902
[2024-07-15 09:56 PM] Deciusmus: Nothing canonical I think but I haven’t gotten that far and am not at my computer.
[2024-07-15 09:56 PM] rsulfuratus: so mariner migrations must be a few hundred years before that at least
[2024-07-15 09:56 PM] rsulfuratus: probably more
[2024-07-15 09:57 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure we need to settle this tonight - i have more session prep to do anyway - but probably something like 1500-1700 is more correct for human origin than the later dates. 2400 is definitely too late, not enough history on Hkar before migrations IMO
[2024-07-15 09:57 PM] Deciusmus: Right. So let’s say 3500 or earlier. Probably first explorers 3300
[2024-07-15 09:57 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah agreed no need to settle right now
[2024-07-15 09:59 PM] rsulfuratus: my vision of human history on Hkar is that it is largely driven by developments in magic. so when everyone has a personal deity things don't change much, everyone has a bit of magic that makes life pretty comfortable (although some people create curses and bring the nine hells into existence)
[2024-07-15 09:59 PM] rsulfuratus: this continues for a long while, potentially. but once arcane magic comes you get the rapid development of the hkar urban culture, the split with the mariners, etc
[2024-07-15 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: But as a strawman maybe something like:
    
    - 1500 creation
    - 2250-2500 northerners
    - 2800-2900 earliest pantheons
    - 3300 - mariners start
    - 3400 - mariners peak
    - 3500 - mariners end
[2024-07-15 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: But with the northerners and pantheon dates perhaps moved a bit or a lot
[2024-07-15 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, something like that is fairly reasonble as a rough starting point to work out. mariners might shift a bit later depending on how long it takes them to found tollen (not sure it would take 500 years to settle the length of the green sea, that seems a bit excessive)
[2024-07-15 10:02 PM] Deciusmus: Sure. It depends on how long they spend mucking about in the magic islands having religious schisms
[2024-07-15 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus: downfall is like 4100 or thereabouts
[2024-07-15 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus: right, sure
[2024-07-15 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: It’s probably worth leaving the exact mariner dates a little vague in case we need more time for them wandered around in the far east
