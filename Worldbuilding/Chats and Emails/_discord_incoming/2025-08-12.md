[2025-08-12 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus: i'm going to spend my lunch break doing a little Alaska trip organizing. i poked around at hotels this morning and many places have not released rooms for next season yet; my sense is the same is true with tour operators (i never heard back from the allan marine folks i contacted in sitka). 
    
    i suspect it will be easier to plan things in, say, October when the 2025 summer season is over and operators / hotels are shifting gears to next season. if you have opinions on best time to start looking for hotels and tours, curious what you think
    
    my current plan is to:
    - send an email to everyone with some details and a link to the Wanderlog itinerary and suggestions about flight searches 
    - fill in the wanderlog details for Juneau and Glacier Bay, like it is for Sitka
    
    but otherwise not likely to do much for this trip for a few months or so
    
    i think just using the wanderlog checklists is easiest way to avoid duplication of effort
