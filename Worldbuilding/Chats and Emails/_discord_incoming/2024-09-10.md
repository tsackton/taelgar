[2024-09-10 08:59 AM] rsulfuratus: started to push a bunch of addermarch stuff, fyi
[2024-09-10 08:59 AM] rsulfuratus: some stuff still in stub/draft form
[2024-09-10 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: did you ever make any sort of map
[2024-09-10 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: I have a hex map that is kind of half done
[2024-09-10 04:08 PM] rsulfuratus: i do intend to finish it but got kind of busy at work
[2024-09-10 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: which river is the umber
[2024-09-10 04:10 PM] rsulfuratus: Aure - main river that runs from Darkwood north past Adderfell
    ~ East Aure Fork ~ - the river that joins Aure from the east, just north of Adderfell
    ~ Main Aure Fork ~ - the river that joins Aure from the west, a bit north of Adderfell
    - Umber - the river that joins the Main Aure Fork furthest west
[2024-09-10 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: don't have the other branch (that joins Main Aure Fork between Umber and Adderfell confluence) in notes yet
[2024-09-10 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: Not sure best way to comment, but here are a few on the Mostreve Hills:
    
    I'm not totally sure I understand the geography.
    
    
    Is your view that the four regions you have are basically what I've labeld 1/2/3/4 here:
![[../_discord_assets/image-D9F3A.png]]
[2024-09-10 04:33 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2024-09-10 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: I was confused because you had "NORTH" of Latazaro swamp, took me a minute to figure out you meant south (I'm fixing)
[2024-09-10 04:35 PM] Deciusmus: how hilly is the darkwood? is it split by the hills, or kinda more inside the "bowl"?
[2024-09-10 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: more inside the bowl imo
[2024-09-10 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: although also it is clearly along a watershed divide
[2024-09-10 04:37 PM] rsulfuratus: but i think the highest ground actually runs kind of along the edge of the rivers just below 2
[2024-09-10 04:37 PM] Deciusmus: right. maybe westcliff is more like a sideways T
[2024-09-10 04:39 PM] Deciusmus: or I guess not quite, but the land of the Darkwood itself is hilly to the west and north, less so to the south and east
[2024-09-10 04:40 PM] rsulfuratus: I think Westcliff is kind of a big C marked in brown, with the very steep sections the two parallel lines due west
![[../_discord_assets/image-6C5FE.png]]
[2024-09-10 04:41 PM] Deciusmus: height of land being something like:
    
    with 1 being the highest, then 2, then 4, and 3, then 5
![[../_discord_assets/image-49DBD.png]]
[2024-09-10 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, exactly
[2024-09-10 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe swapping 4 and 3
[2024-09-10 04:43 PM] rsulfuratus: or anyway 4 and 3 are pretty close. 5 is noticably less high than 3/4
[2024-09-10 04:43 PM] rsulfuratus: so you have in the "East Aure Fork" highlands a fair bit of bare, open ground and some alpine meadows, while in 5 ("Tyrwingha borderlands") you have more rolling hills largely forested at the summits
[2024-09-10 04:44 PM] rsulfuratus: (but some of this is driven by poor soil in the 3/4 area as these are not quite as tall and definitely not as steep as 1)
[2024-09-10 05:47 PM] Deciusmus: Geographically, the Mostreve Hills are composed of five distinct ridgelines:
    * The [[Westcliff]] ridge runs in a truncated north-south 'C', on the western edge of the Mostreve Hills, with the highest and steepest parts of the ridge along the western edge, bordering the [[Maseau Gap]]. The highest peaks of the Mostreve Hills are here, especially along the western escarpment. 
    * The ~Unnamed Aure Headwaters Ridge~ runs mostly east-west, arising from the rolling hills of the [[Aure]] river valley some 50 miles east of the Westcliff ridge, and cutting in a south-south-easterly line towards the headwaters of the [[~Aure East Fork~]]. This ridgeline partially separates [[Addermarch]] from the [[Darkwood]]. 
    * The ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~, which runs in a north-easterly line, starting north of the [[~Aure East Fork~]]
    * The ~North Tyrwinghan Ridge~ which is east of the Aure, and runs in a series of lines running north-west from the Tyrwinghan ridge. These peaks are notably gentler than the other ridges, and form less of a barrier to travel.
    * The ~Orlenas Ridge~, which starts south of the [[Latazaro]] swamp and runs almost due east until it grows in the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]]
[2024-09-10 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: In between these ridgelines are several major gaps:
    * The [[Aure]] river cuts between the Westcliff and Tyrwinghan ridges, in a broad and relatively fertile river valley
    * The Darkwood creeps north between the Westcliff ridge and the ~Unnamed Aure Headwaters Ridge~, forming a hilly wildland on the southern borders of [[Addermarch]]
    * (Something between the Aure Headwaters Ridge and the Tyrwinghan Ridge, on the map at least it looks like it should be a hilly gap, although not sure what is here)
    * Between the ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~ and the ~Orlenas Ridge~ the land is hilly but there are few high ridgelines, and multiple passes cut through the Mostreve HIlls immediately northwest of [[Orenlas]].
[2024-09-10 05:49 PM] Deciusmus: Not sure if the ridges would actually be named, although historically in i.e. the applachian mts everything is (Blue Ridge, Smokies, WHite Mts, Green Mts, Berkshires, Poconos, etc)
[2024-09-10 05:56 PM] Deciusmus: A few other random thoughts... 
    
    (a) the lower Aure is somewhat unclear. Is it unsettled (if so, why)? If not (on the map it is mostly Tyrwinghan, I guess), what is the transition between Addermarch and Tyrwingha? Is there a formal border? A geographic feature
    
    (b) the upper "Aure East Fork" also seems a bit unclear. It is hilly and impassible? Too dangerous for settlement? Too close to elves?
[2024-09-10 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: I think this is basically right. A few small details / additions:
    - The Aure Headwaters Ridge increases in height as you move to the southeast, and the soil gets poorer, so e.g. near the Aure headwaters you have the creeping edge of the Darkwood (which I think the Addermarians would see really as something that is invading their country and needs to be cut back), but by the southeastern end (headwaters of river that heads south to plaguelands) this is dry, marginal land with bad soil and can't support much in the way of forests
    - The  Tyrwingan Ridge I think runs the same way in reverse, steepest/highest/worst land on the southwest end, getting better as you move north/east towards Tyrwingha
    - The "East Aure River Valley" is a gap between the Aure Headers and Tyrwingan Ridge, which is not forested except in pockets, and is generally poor soil and pastureland, but supports a lot of sheep and cows potentially
[2024-09-10 05:58 PM] rsulfuratus: Re questions:
    (a) there probably needs to be a border between Tyrwingha and Addermarch along the lower Aure. I don't think Addermarch extends all the way to the Enst
[2024-09-10 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: Right, agree with that, but not clear why a border. Maybe just the edge of Ethlenn's claim
[2024-09-10 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: ?
[2024-09-10 05:58 PM] rsulfuratus: that is probably the most obvious answer
[2024-09-10 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: It might also make sense to run a small river from approximately "5" on the map above to the Aure, to form a border
[2024-09-10 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: or I guess somewhere between 4 & 5
[2024-09-10 06:00 PM] rsulfuratus: i think also this is an area where there isn't a clear sense of physical borders. before drankor anyway everyone owed allegiance to an earl but they don't have physical lines, in that a village to earl A coudl be surrounded by a vilalge to earl B in theory
[2024-09-10 06:00 PM] rsulfuratus: at some point Tyrwingha probably reshuffles things (during Drankor negotiations?) so that only Ethlenn's claim is separate from Drankor
[2024-09-10 06:00 PM] rsulfuratus: but no reason there needs to be a physical feature to define a border here
[2024-09-10 06:03 PM] Deciusmus: Right. Maybe there is an ancient line of Drankorian/fey border stones
[2024-09-10 06:03 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that would be interesting
[2024-09-10 06:03 PM] Deciusmus: I kinda like that better than a river
[2024-09-10 06:05 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the addermarch border to the north runs along the line of the cliffs (where there really isnt a border since no one lives on the very summits), and on the west side of the Aure the cliff line basically meets the river, anything north of that is "not Addermarch" but might be either Tyrwingha or Sembaran borderlands
[2024-09-10 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: on the east of the Aure, the border with Tyrwingha is marked by ancient stones from Drankorian era with fey markings
[2024-09-10 06:07 PM] rsulfuratus: something like the blue lines
![[../_discord_assets/image-BB4F6.png]]
[2024-09-10 06:08 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I was envisioning stones that went from the Aure to peak along ridge. Sorta where the blue line is but maybe a little bit south, i.e. just straighter east
[2024-09-10 06:09 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that works too
[2024-09-10 06:09 PM] Deciusmus: The Tyrwinghan border, is basically then: the coast/Aure/line of markers/not defined because no one lives in the southern parts of the Tyrwinghan ridge
[2024-09-10 06:11 PM] rsulfuratus: something like
![[../_discord_assets/image-BB2BC.png]]
[2024-09-10 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: basically this:
    
    where the yellow highlight is tyrwinghan border, the red x's is the fey/drankorian marker line, and the blue scribble is a height of land
![[../_discord_assets/image-AE003.png]]
[2024-09-10 06:12 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-09-10 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: so the "tyrwinghan" ridge region doesn't have "borders", it is just unsettled land between tyrwinghan and addermarch
[2024-09-10 06:13 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not totally clear on what the forset just south of the hills is though
[2024-09-10 06:13 PM] rsulfuratus: that is plaguelands
[2024-09-10 06:13 PM] Deciusmus: ah. I didn't realize the stretched so far north
[2024-09-10 06:13 PM] Deciusmus: so is that river / lake all plaguelands, basically (west of Orenlas)?
[2024-09-10 06:14 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the rivers that join just north of the big southern lake delimit the kind of outer edge of the influence of Orenlas
[2024-09-10 06:15 PM] rsulfuratus: although none of this is technically canon. in the defunct Plaguelands campaign the Cinder Court (which was the main enemy) was going to be based in the forests between Orenlas and Addermarch
[2024-09-10 06:15 PM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-36320.png]]
[2024-09-10 06:16 PM] Deciusmus: hard to read, but trying to say the far west blue circle is darkwood. the yellow line is about Orenlas? But the other 2 big blue circles.. are you saying those are plagueland? Or just "hrm bad stuff no people who knows what bad stuff"?
[2024-09-10 06:16 PM] rsulfuratus: the lower left "?" is, IMO, kinda "Darkwood++"
[2024-09-10 06:17 PM] rsulfuratus: the Darkwood in my mind has this kind of "evil fey" vibe of always trying to press in and grow into the human kingdoms
[2024-09-10 06:17 PM] Deciusmus: this doesn't have to be canon, but:
![[../_discord_assets/image-CE24E.png]]
[2024-09-10 06:18 PM] Deciusmus: but maybe twilight's grace doesn't so quite so far south and/or the taelgar/feywild mapping isn't perfect or something
[2024-09-10 06:18 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah exactly so the lower left ? is matching up perfectly with Duskmire
[2024-09-10 06:18 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2024-09-10 06:18 PM] Deciusmus: I think that's clearly Darkwood/Darkwood++
[2024-09-10 06:18 PM] rsulfuratus: Twilight's Grace borders though should be adjusted to not cover addermarch
[2024-09-10 06:18 PM] rsulfuratus: and match the Drankorian border stones
[2024-09-10 06:19 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-09-10 06:19 PM] rsulfuratus: I'd move "3" down to fill it, but it also sets up Addermarch as kind of a battleground state in the feywild
[2024-09-10 06:20 PM] rsulfuratus: and 3 here - covering Fellburn and Eskbridge - is potentially the domain of Nathaniel's patron and the de Brune family secret fey
[2024-09-10 06:20 PM] Deciusmus: "3" is the "mostly Ethlenn aligned border small fey kingdoms"
[2024-09-10 06:21 PM] Deciusmus: so fits the de Brune secret fey perfectly, although I think maybe it is a unsettled place without a clear single "master archfey domain"
[2024-09-10 06:21 PM] rsulfuratus: right, yes
[2024-09-10 06:21 PM] Deciusmus: Still open question what is between Tyrwinghan and Orenlas
[2024-09-10 06:22 PM] Deciusmus: which relates to Addermarch in the sense of ... why havent they expanded up the Aure East Fork valley
[2024-09-10 06:22 PM] Deciusmus: what makes that southeastern border a border?
[2024-09-10 06:22 PM] rsulfuratus: in my mind, the mountains are much rougher and steeper than indicated on the world map
[2024-09-10 06:22 PM] Deciusmus: right, ok
[2024-09-10 06:23 PM] rsulfuratus: I think if you look at the topography as implied by watersheds instead of the drawn hills
[2024-09-10 06:24 PM] Deciusmus: so you really have high ridges like:
![[../_discord_assets/image-42073.png]]
[2024-09-10 06:24 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i think that is more accurate
[2024-09-10 06:25 PM] rsulfuratus: then what is the woods northeast of darkwood and west of orenlas is an open question but definitely not "human civilization"
[2024-09-10 06:25 PM] Deciusmus: I like that, lessens the need to define what is south of the hills
[2024-09-10 06:26 PM] Deciusmus: So basically, in my "five ridgelines" the big change is really that the "Aure Headwaters Ridge" runs all the way east until it connects with the Tyrwinghan Ridge
[2024-09-10 06:27 PM] Deciusmus: and probably that area - where the ridges intersect - is the highest and roughest terrain east of Westcliff
[2024-09-10 06:29 PM] Deciusmus: so something like:
![[../_discord_assets/image-BF1DD.png]]
[2024-09-10 06:30 PM] Deciusmus: yellow = major ridges
    green = lower/minor ridges
    red xs = particularly high points
[2024-09-10 06:30 PM] rsulfuratus: 👍
[2024-09-10 06:43 PM] Deciusmus: ### Borders
    
    To the west and northwest Addermarch is bordered by the [[Westcliff]], a series of sharp cliffs and dangerous terrain that separates the realm from the flat plains of the [[Duchy of Maseau]] to the west, and the [[Borderlands|Sembaran borderlands]] to the north. At the Aure, the high ridge of [[Westcliff]] is cut by the river, and on the eastern bank, the land is much lower. Here an ancient line of border stones running to [[~High Peak of Tyrwinghan Ridge~]] demarcates the border with [[Tyrwingha]]. These stones are said by some to be raised by Drankor, but they are marked with complex warnings in [[Sylvan Writing|Sylvan]], and many believe they have fey origins.
    
    The eastern border is not marked, as the high terrain between Addermarch and Tyrwinghan is unpopulated. The gentler, forested slopes to the north and east are under the demense of Tyrwinghan earls, and the dryer, arid slopes to the south and west, the land of Addermarian earls.
    
    To the south, Addermarch is bordered by the high ridge of the [[Mostreve Hills]], where the headwaters of the [[~Aure East Fork~]] flow, and then, to the southwest, the [[Darkwood]]. This border is carefully watched for fear of what might creep out in the shadows.
[2024-09-10 07:04 PM] rsulfuratus: Great
[2024-09-10 08:39 PM] rsulfuratus: did you push any of this? working on some updates
[2024-09-10 08:40 PM] Deciusmus: no, pushing a bit now
[2024-09-10 08:40 PM] Deciusmus: got distracted by dinner + such but looking at it now again
[2024-09-10 08:42 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed the addermarch border update
[2024-09-10 08:42 PM] Deciusmus: am pushing mostreve in a minute although still a little rough
[2024-09-10 08:53 PM] Deciusmus: I'm pushing mostreve but I think it still needs a bit of work and some of the language is a bit rougher than what you had
[2024-09-10 08:53 PM] rsulfuratus: that's fine
