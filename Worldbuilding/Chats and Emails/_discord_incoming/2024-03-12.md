[2024-03-12 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: I like it.
[2024-03-12 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: I actually thing Vahaiya is going to be a signifcant NPC for the next 2 or 3 sessions of my game
[2024-03-12 05:01 PM] Deciusmus: (although the ears feel a little big)
[2024-03-12 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: midjourney really likes big eared elves
[2024-03-12 05:02 PM] rsulfuratus: haven't figured out a good prompt to make them more tolkein-esque
[2024-03-12 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: I was going to suggest that if you wanted to come NPC them you should, but my next game is Easter Sunday
[2024-03-12 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: that would be fun - but probably can't make it on easter
[2024-03-12 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: what time do you play?
[2024-03-12 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: ~12 - 5
[2024-03-12 05:04 PM] Deciusmus: my other 2 scheduled games are April 28 and June 2
[2024-03-12 05:06 PM] Deciusmus: If you wanted to come play them in one of those. Actually June 2 would be the most fun, that's when they are likely doing fey-wild stuff with Vahaiya
[2024-03-12 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: I think I am going to be flying to europe that day so it might be a bit much. i'll check my calendar. april 28 is definitely free
[2024-03-12 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: I have one player who can't make the Easter game, so the PCs are splitting up, with 3 of them going to Rinberg to investigate a monster that is dwelling in a lake near there, the other one going back to Cleenseau to bring news. He also might not be able to make April 28 in which case I am going to drag out the Rinberg adventure. If he can make APril 28, that would be the "Back in Cleenseau" and investigating fey stuff with Vahaiya game
[2024-03-12 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: If he can't, it would be June 2
[2024-03-12 05:22 PM] rsulfuratus: this one is maybe a little better: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022671284917776444/1217221011876085900/rsulfuratus_a_nonbinary_archer_in_a_forest_wearing_leather_armo_89cffac1-db84-4871-9d9f-ef28b62dfa54.png?ex=66033c68&is=65f0c768&hm=bac83f2772519ed292ec469942b5d1d3c9f29dc8b8481ac4e647ac98bf1d2284&
