# Discord DM – 2023-11-19

[2023-11-19 09:48 AM] Deciusmus: Your generate header changes are not quite right 🙂
[2023-11-19 09:49 AM] Deciusmus: if you do this:
    let type = NameManager.getName(metadata.typeOf, "exists", "lower") ?? getDefaultTypeOf(metadata);
    
    it means that "mainType" will never be the subtype
[2023-11-19 09:49 AM] Deciusmus: maybe that's ok because we don't use maintype except for people?
[2023-11-19 09:49 AM] rsulfuratus: but subtype can be maintype
[2023-11-19 09:50 AM] rsulfuratus: ah right
[2023-11-19 09:50 AM] rsulfuratus: different part
[2023-11-19 09:50 AM] Deciusmus: .replace("`<mainType>`", subspecies ?? species ?? type ?? subType ?? getDefaultTypeOf(metadata) ?? "")
[2023-11-19 09:51 AM] rsulfuratus: i was adding info to items and it was very easy to get "(rare armor armor)" or "(rare armor item)" so wanted to prevent that
[2023-11-19 09:51 AM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2023-11-19 09:51 AM] Deciusmus: I noticed that this morning as well
[2023-11-19 09:52 AM] Deciusmus: But I was fixing it with tag order, i.e.
    
    typeOf: armor
    tags: `[item/magical, item/armor]`
    
    does the right thing
[2023-11-19 09:52 AM] Deciusmus: but fixing this is good, I'll push the better fix in a sec
[2023-11-19 09:57 AM] Deciusmus: BTW if you are working on items be aware the current header doesnt add mechanics links
[2023-11-19 09:57 AM] Deciusmus: I am pushing a fix for that right now...
    
    new ddbLinkText in display defaults
    defaults to Mechanics for items & Character Sheet for people
[2023-11-19 09:58 AM] rsulfuratus: mostly working on session prep and tagging, just occasionally hitting "random note"
[2023-11-19 09:58 AM] Deciusmus: I also have a fix to whereabouts so that you can use the "startStatus" in the whereabouts line
[2023-11-19 09:58 AM] Deciusmus: Much nicer to have items use something like
    
    `<start>` by `<loc>`
    
    for the "origin"
[2023-11-19 10:00 AM] Deciusmus: i.e.
![[../_discord_assets/image-38B04.png]]
[2023-11-19 10:00 AM] rsulfuratus: nice
[2023-11-19 10:00 AM] Deciusmus: the real fancy trick would be to propagate the date correctly
[2023-11-19 10:00 AM] rsulfuratus: I think the default for events pagePastWithStart should be: "pagePastWithStart: "`<startDate>` - `<endDate>`, lasted `<length>` years"
[2023-11-19 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus: have manually added that to a few events and think it looks much better than:
    "1545-1555, lasted 10 years"
    vs
    "Happened 1545-1555, ended after 10 years"
[2023-11-19 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus: going to change unless you object
[2023-11-19 10:01 AM] Deciusmus: no go ahead
[2023-11-19 10:23 AM] Deciusmus: Ok, last update before the party... I fixed origin whereabouts to follow the location chain at the date
[2023-11-19 10:24 AM] Deciusmus: So the Mantle of Protection now shows:
![[../_discord_assets/image-02574.png]]
[2023-11-19 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus: nice
[2023-11-19 10:25 AM] Deciusmus: 
![[../_discord_assets/image-EED11.png]]
[2023-11-19 10:25 AM] Deciusmus: (the "Kharsan" bit is because that is where it was in 1720)
[2023-11-19 10:25 AM] Deciusmus: I still want to fix the current whereabouts line to use the whereabouts display from the TARGET rather than source page
[2023-11-19 10:26 AM] Deciusmus: i.e. the current location of an item that is in a place should use the place whereabouts rather than the item whereabouts, I think
[2023-11-19 10:26 AM] Deciusmus: But that's a bigger change
[2023-11-19 10:26 AM] Deciusmus: oh, and I need to fix the 1719 years ago
[2023-11-19 10:28 AM] Deciusmus: There are a few glitches with unknown dates, like it would work better if there was an actual date there
[2023-11-19 10:28 AM] Deciusmus: My "0001" means "created but who knows when" doesn't quite work
[2023-11-19 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus: >`the TARGET rather than source page
    >`i.e. the current location of an item that is in a place should use the >`place whereabouts rather than the item whereabouts, I think
    
    that would be quite complicated. i think you always want to control text on the page itself, but need something like located_in_person vs located_in_place vs located_in_thing
[2023-11-19 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus: e.g on page X, you want to be able to change the display defaults to have located-in-person locations and located-in-place locations look different
[2023-11-19 10:30 AM] Deciusmus: right, that probably works better
[2023-11-19 10:31 AM] Deciusmus: I think we should start logging ideas like this as github issues
[2023-11-19 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus: really, we need a taelgar github organization
[2023-11-19 10:33 AM] Deciusmus: The big next set of javascript I want to write is:
    * Alias handling for an also known as in the header
    * Better date support: the idea of "approximate" that changes the display text somewhat so you can say "created: ~1000" or something
    * Better date support: CY and DR years
    * Better whereabouts chain following as discussed above
[2023-11-19 10:33 AM] Deciusmus: Anyway, we are heading to your house now.
[2023-11-19 08:39 PM] Deciusmus: I'm doing some gazeeter cleanup...
    
    I've been trying to follow a specific pattern of  for buildings, set typeOf generically (inn, temple, etc) and then set ancestry (for "halfling inn") and subTypeOf (for who the temple is for or a more detailed type of inn - tavern, caravanseri, etc)
    
    This should make it easy to query for "all the inns of taelgar" or "all the temples of taelgar"
[2023-11-19 08:39 PM] Deciusmus: For religious buildings I've been setting the partOf to
    "A `<typeof>` of `<subtypeof>` in `<loc>`"
[2023-11-19 08:39 PM] Deciusmus: so you get:
    >``[!info]`+ Information
    >` A temple of [[Shakun]] in [[Karawa]], [[Eastern Dunmar]], [[Dunmar]]
[2023-11-19 08:42 PM] rsulfuratus: I haven't done much on buildings other than a few inns
[2023-11-19 08:42 PM] rsulfuratus: but that sounds reasonable
[2023-11-19 08:53 PM] Deciusmus: I've also been trying to use:
    
    village or town or city for various sized settlements
    ruin for anything old and ruined
    realm for political units / kingdom-things
    region for any generic "place"
[2023-11-19 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: Also, do we have a clear place to put things like, the Lord's Council of Cleenseau?
[2023-11-19 08:56 PM] Deciusmus: Should we try to restrict gazeetter to actual physical places and move other things to organizations
[2023-11-19 08:56 PM] Deciusmus: (that is where I was leaning)
[2023-11-19 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i would put groups that are very specific to a place in gazeetter
[2023-11-19 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: but i'm not certain
[2023-11-19 08:58 PM] rsulfuratus: i think there is a lot of value in having the stuff for a specific place in one spot as it is a lot quicker to skim through, and it is easier to send out to players
[2023-11-19 08:59 PM] rsulfuratus: in the ideal world I would like to have a bunch of carefully organized folders (people, places, things, groups, species, cosmology), and then have a gazetteer that is organized more like a sourcebook, but is almost exclusively autogenerated by embedding other notes
[2023-11-19 09:01 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess initially i'd focus more on tagging than reorganizing directories though
[2023-11-19 09:02 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, agreed, I just was moving all the Sembaran army stuff (which I definitely do think belongs outside of Sembara) and I noticed those
[2023-11-19 09:02 PM] Deciusmus: I'm actually of the opinion that with the right tagged and dataview system, it is nicer to have everything floating around and then "overview pages" for important places that show people/places/etc in a place
[2023-11-19 09:03 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. a 
    
    Political Organization of Cleenseau
    dataview query for type = organization/political, partOf = Cleenseau
    
    is a lot nicer to me than trying to find stuff in the cleenseau folder
[2023-11-19 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah. I think my plan would be to focus on content cleanup and adding frontmatter, and then kind of see where things are after having a chance to play around with dataview with fleshed out content
[2023-11-19 09:14 PM] Deciusmus: On a totally different topic I’m trying to plan sorcerer vs warlock. Sorcerer lvl 2 gives me almost nothing useful but lvl 3 is great as it grants metamagic
[2023-11-19 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: I’m not sure when the best time to waste a level on sorc 2
[2023-11-19 09:37 PM] rsulfuratus: it is a little hard to predict because I'm not entirely sure what you are doing after you kill Grash
[2023-11-19 09:38 PM] rsulfuratus: generally except for level 9, which was very short, i've aimed for ~2 story beats / 8 sessions between levels
[2023-11-19 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: probably next level up would be after next rai hand piece (grash session, 1-2 non-combat sessions in Uzguhkar/Orenlas/Tollen, 3 sessions for fragment adventure); then again after you get all 5 before the final showdown in drankor
[2023-11-19 09:41 PM] rsulfuratus: but it is hard to predict as it is sometimes difficult to know when you'll get sidetracked
[2023-11-19 09:42 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess if it were me i'd just take it now, unless there is a feat you really want, since warlock 12 is kind of boring too
[2023-11-19 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: personally i'd do sorcerer 2 next, sorcerer 3 after, then warlock 12 going into drankor and take metamagic adept to end up with 5 sorcery points + 3 metamagic options
[2023-11-19 09:53 PM] rsulfuratus: i assume ultimately you want 17 warlock / 3 sorcerer
[2023-11-19 09:53 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2023-11-19 09:54 PM] Deciusmus: I think sorc 2 / sorc 3 / warlock 12 is probably good. Are you aiming for lvl 15 for Apollyon showdown?
[2023-11-19 09:55 PM] rsulfuratus: i am assuming level 15 when you enter drankor, assuming you mostly go straight to getting the three shards of the hand.
[2023-11-19 09:55 PM] rsulfuratus: might be 16 instead of 15 for apollyon fight, but very unlikely to be higher
[2023-11-19 09:58 PM] rsulfuratus: btw - definitely think it makes sense that you take the ring of sharp mind, but also don't forget you can use your sorcerer feature (+2d4) on failed concentration checks as well
[2023-11-19 09:58 PM] Deciusmus: Oh that’s a good point. I forget about that all the time
[2023-11-19 09:59 PM] rsulfuratus: sharp mind is supposed to be a backup so that you don't feel like you can't wade into melee, but with advantage plus the 2d4 if you fail, 6 uses should last a good long while
[2023-11-19 09:59 PM] rsulfuratus: and the 2d4 recharges on short rest
[2023-11-19 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
