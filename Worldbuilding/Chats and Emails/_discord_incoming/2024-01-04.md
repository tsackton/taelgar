# Discord DM – 2024-01-04

[2024-01-04 08:47 PM] Deciusmus: I've been mucking about with Sembara in more detail, as I try to work out the impacts of this mass of undead. Not really changing much from the big Sembara document, but a few things I wanted to at least vaguely run by you...

The basic idea of the new map is that 
(a) there is a core unit of the six ancient duchies and a few border baronies (Aveil + Ainwick) which is the historic ancient Sembara
(b) this is all the lowlands ... as the land rises north and west of several different lines of hills, you get into a loosely defined border with the highland kingdoms. There are lots (at least a dozen, perhaps two dozen) baronies here, and there is no "formal border" but really a loose line of loyalties. This "highland Sembara" stretches all the way from the Volta to the Wistel..
(c) Then there are the southern borderlands (south of the Enst) and the western borderlands (west of Ainwick/Cleenseau). These are all lands that have had significant post-Great War distruption. The western borderlands were largely depopulated in the aftermath of the Great War, as the destruction of [[Urlich Pass]] changed the entire economic rationale, and refugees fled west. A small number of military towns (i.e. Dunmore from the original one-shot) remained, but the land would have been really sparsely populated in the 1580s.
The lands south of the Enst were ruled by hogoblins for 50 years in the early 1600s

[2024-01-04 08:48 PM] Deciusmus: So basically, all of the infrastructure west of Aveil/Ainwick and south of the Enst was rebuilt/reestablished during the long peaceful reign of Cece I, which I imagine was also a baby boom time. Settlers were flowing west and south to populate these new lands, etc
[2024-01-04 08:49 PM] Deciusmus: The far western baronies (Dunfry/Usbourg/Enford/Bronva) were explicitly establised by Cece as military districts, although by 1748 the direct military relationship has probably faded, especially in Dunfry and Usbourg
[2024-01-04 08:51 PM] Deciusmus: The southern baronies (I have 5 but might expand to 6 or 7) were all new grants, also by Cece, largely to loyalists from the wars. That section (between the Enst and Adderfell) is probably decent farmland, it was just ravaged by hobgoblins and war. So it is probably somewhat booming these days, lots of growth
[2024-01-04 08:54 PM] Deciusmus: historically, Maseau and Adderfell were never part of "historic" Sembara. Maseau was established by Derik I after his defeat of Atavas, as basically new land,
[2024-01-04 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: Adderfell I think has always had close ties with Tyrwingha, and is probably only not part of Tyrwingha because the Tyrwinghan borders are set by Ethlenn for mysterious reasons and she doesn't want it -- although it is likely somewhat congruent with her kingdom.
[2024-01-04 08:58 PM] Deciusmus: For a long time the earls of Adderfell probably looked to Tyrwingha for direction, and they only gradually came into the Sembaran orbit after Derik became king of Tyrwingha. But probably in some formal sense, it has never been "ruled" by Sembara in the sense that its always been an allied state, not a specific and direct place ruled by the monarch, so to speak
[2024-01-04 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: I think this all basically works. one thing to think about is who exactly are the people living in these places? I've been reading the Great Sea again (the Mediterranean book I started in Nantucket, but I got bored after the fall of Rome and put it aside for a while until recently), and one thing that is really clear from this, which is probably obvious but perhaps isn't incorporated enough into Taelgar worldbuilding, is that you have these big empires that expand and contract across the Mediterranean over 600 years, but for the most part, the people don't move around (with some exceptions like medieval spain and some trade colonies)
[2024-01-04 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: so I guess I would think a bit about what the cultures are here
[2024-01-04 09:08 PM] Deciusmus: Well, that's part of why I want the Great War to have been so depopulating
[2024-01-04 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, you have refugee movements and resettlement too
[2024-01-04 09:09 PM] Deciusmus: I think basically there are two ancient cultures here -- the highland culture and the lowland culture, which spread up the river valleys
[2024-01-04 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: Within the lowland culture (which is the core of Sembara today) you have a Tyrwinghan variant, which isn't hugely different, but has some unique strains via the fey connection
[2024-01-04 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: Maseau is always been a bit of a marginal borderland.
[2024-01-04 09:11 PM] rsulfuratus: I would think Maseau would have been fairly rich Drankorian province, if only by nearby association with Isingue
[2024-01-04 09:12 PM] Deciusmus: Hrm, maybe
[2024-01-04 09:12 PM] rsulfuratus: but probably no need to go back that far, really
[2024-01-04 09:12 PM] Deciusmus: I feel like the land is less fertile.
[2024-01-04 09:13 PM] Deciusmus: The southern part of Maseau, probably. The northern section south of the Enst is kinda marginal farmland, compared to more eastern Sembara
[2024-01-04 09:13 PM] Deciusmus: But also, ignoring that far back
[2024-01-04 09:14 PM] Deciusmus: Start with Atavas, say
[2024-01-04 09:14 PM] Deciusmus: The whole area between Insingue and Sembara is under hobgoblin rule for some time. They probably don't kill everyone, but you would imagine that as being pretty disruptive
[2024-01-04 09:15 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, and at that point for a while it probably feels like Sembara is pretty cut off
[2024-01-04 09:15 PM] rsulfuratus: insignue is still connected to Dunmar-Chardon trade routes and the Green Sea via Orenlas / Cymea / "South Cymea"
[2024-01-04 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2024-01-04 09:16 PM] Deciusmus: And I suspect a lot of refugee flows *south* during the Atavas wars
[2024-01-04 09:16 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, that would make sense - this is also the height of Dunmar's military power
[2024-01-04 09:17 PM] Deciusmus: Right, so that seems like a safer bet. But Derik is the one who actually defeats Atavas, and has an upper hand at reestablishing the human kingdoms in the region
[2024-01-04 09:17 PM] rsulfuratus: Isingue is closer to Kharsan than Tokra to Kharsan, for example
[2024-01-04 09:18 PM] Deciusmus: So he finds someone suitable, makes them a Duke and gets them to pledge feudal loyalty to him, and so a somewhat depopulated Maseau - which its own more Insinguen culture somewhat distinct from Sembara gets incorporated into the kingdom
[2024-01-04 09:20 PM] Deciusmus: So at the eve of the Great War you have basically 5 cultures in Sembara:
    
    * The highland culture
    * The lowland culture, which spreads all the way to the mountains along the Enst
    * The Tyringhan vairnt of the lowland culture, also in Adderfell
    * The Maseau culture, kinda weakened/depopulated
    * The northern/Tollen-influenced culture which is another variant of Sembaran, but basically not too different, along the Volta
[2024-01-04 09:21 PM] rsulfuratus: right I was just typing exactly same thing but slower
[2024-01-04 09:22 PM] rsulfuratus: politically, the lowland culture is very dominant at this point, as well
[2024-01-04 09:22 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-01-04 09:23 PM] rsulfuratus: I kind of fell like Tyrwingha is a bit more diverged than this makes it seem, though. by the time of the Great War, the Tyrwinghans have been living under the protection of the fey for ~1000 years
[2024-01-04 09:23 PM] rsulfuratus: i would think that would not be a minor influence
[2024-01-04 09:23 PM] Deciusmus: Right, but part of Drankor
[2024-01-04 09:23 PM] Deciusmus: But yeah, actually, I have been playing in my game Tyrwingha has more different than "a variant"
[2024-01-04 09:24 PM] Deciusmus: My player with a Tyrinwghan PC has a tendency to play her character as "somewhat foreign, why do these Sembarans do things weird" which I have not discourged
[2024-01-04 09:25 PM] Deciusmus: but I think it works with the above, i.e. Tyrwingha probably feels pretty different. The unification of the two realms has always been a personal union of crowns, not some kind of real "single country"
[2024-01-04 09:26 PM] rsulfuratus: so then you have Great War, west is upended, plaguelands, all that
[2024-01-04 09:26 PM] Deciusmus: Right. And then in the early 1600s everything south of the Enst is ruled by hobgoblins for 50 years
[2024-01-04 09:26 PM] Deciusmus: almost
[2024-01-04 09:26 PM] Deciusmus: 40-something
[2024-01-04 09:26 PM] rsulfuratus: at this point everyone who survives is basically just pledging themselves to Derik III in desperation
[2024-01-04 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: Right, although Sembara also is abandoning people left and right
[2024-01-04 09:27 PM] rsulfuratus: after Derik III dies though
[2024-01-04 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-01-04 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: true
[2024-01-04 09:28 PM] rsulfuratus: so at that point I think there is room for a bit more complex set of loyalities and obligations that doesn't result in Sembara just being one big country in a modern sense
[2024-01-04 09:28 PM] rsulfuratus: you already have personal union of crowns that joins Sembara and Tyrwingha
[2024-01-04 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: but for example adderfell can have relatively shifting loyalities
[2024-01-04 09:29 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah - although I think Adderfell has been more of a Tyrwinghan than Sembaran allied state
[2024-01-04 09:29 PM] Deciusmus: historically
[2024-01-04 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: then of course this motivates Cece I to install loyalists in the newly created duchies / marches
[2024-01-04 09:30 PM] rsulfuratus: but I think a lot of places perhaps have more of a feel of "the Barony of Aveil" than "Sembara", wouldn't they?
[2024-01-04 09:30 PM] Deciusmus: Well, I think that changed during Cece's reign
[2024-01-04 09:30 PM] Deciusmus: it was 60-ish years of peace and prosperity
[2024-01-04 09:30 PM] Deciusmus: everyone loved her
[2024-01-04 09:31 PM] Deciusmus: Well, let me think it through
[2024-01-04 09:33 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean my sense historically is that it often was not very important to the people of random place X whether their lord owed alliegance to the king of france or the king of england, except insomuch as it meant they might be killed fighting in a war
[2024-01-04 09:33 PM] Deciusmus: It seems like at the beginning of Cece's reign, you have:
    
    * Maseau, which has been separated from Sembara by a hobgoblin kingdom for 50 years and also has had its own influx of refugees and challenges on its southern border
    * Adderfell, which is also separated from Sembara by hobgoblins, and probably heavily dependent on the Tyrwinghan knights for aid which stuff gets bad
    * Tyrwingha, which has only been recently rejoined with the Sembaran crown and which has a pretty distinct culture at this point
[2024-01-04 09:34 PM] Deciusmus: * The highlands, which really are a place of shifting loyalties, where the "border" is kinda meaningless, and some local lord might be loyal to the monarch of Ardlas rather than Sembara, and which might feel very much like the "barony of whatever" rather than sembara or ardlas specifically
[2024-01-04 09:35 PM] Deciusmus: * The core ancient duchies, which I think includes Aveil and Ainwick (although they were historically the border baronies and loyal to the Duke of Wisford)
[2024-01-04 09:35 PM] Deciusmus: * The western military baronies, still very much army camps and frontier, not so many people
[2024-01-04 09:36 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the bigger worldbuilding question is: given all the danger out there, and magic, and the gods, do humans actually regularly fight wars of conquest?
[2024-01-04 09:36 PM] Deciusmus: No, I think probably not
[2024-01-04 09:36 PM] rsulfuratus: right, I think I agree
[2024-01-04 09:37 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, sometimes things happen - i.e. Chardon + Dunmar. But you don't have stuff like the Norman Conquest of England that often
[2024-01-04 09:37 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess I'm thinking about the approximately 1000 wars fought over siciliy, for example
[2024-01-04 09:38 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-01-04 09:38 PM] rsulfuratus: you could imagine a scenario where northern cymea is constantly changing hands to control the straights
[2024-01-04 09:38 PM] Deciusmus: or the long term war between the english and french kings over france
[2024-01-04 09:39 PM] rsulfuratus: the question then is, the absence of wars of conquest, what changes alliegance? i think generally there would be a very strong incentive to be allied with someone bigger
[2024-01-04 09:39 PM] Deciusmus: I think it is a feeling of safety
[2024-01-04 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: so for example most of the Drankorian conquest of Sembara isn't really a war. it is "we have a huge army and a million wizards" and the sembarans going "awesome come stay"
[2024-01-04 09:40 PM] Deciusmus: Sure
[2024-01-04 09:40 PM] Deciusmus: Although there are exceptions, i.e. the highlanders
[2024-01-04 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: right, obviously
[2024-01-04 09:40 PM] Deciusmus: I don't think it *all* has to be "no war conquest"
[2024-01-04 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: no, of course not, but a lot less than in the real world
[2024-01-04 09:41 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, agreed
[2024-01-04 09:43 PM] rsulfuratus: but I actually think that means you tend to have a bit more local identity, e.g. Barony of Aveil is not not-Sembaran, exactly - the people who live there are largely Sembaran in culture
[2024-01-04 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: and while through long ties of alliance and culture, Aveil is always looking to Sembara first, Sembara probably wouldn't march knights on them if the next Baron refused to swear alliegance to the king
[2024-01-04 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: they might, of course
[2024-01-04 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: but it would be far from a guarantee
[2024-01-04 09:45 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I think that is true
[2024-01-04 09:46 PM] rsulfuratus: on the other hand, if an upstart knight in Cleenseau declares himself king of the river lands, the Baron of Aveil almost certainly is marching knights against him, I would think
[2024-01-04 09:46 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-01-04 09:46 PM] Deciusmus: Although I think its a bit more complicated than that
[2024-01-04 09:46 PM] rsulfuratus: the " long ties of alliance and culture" elides a lot, yes
[2024-01-04 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: but, it would be a reason why the lich would imagine this plan could work
[2024-01-04 09:47 PM] Deciusmus: I actually think the Baron of Aveil is a bad example only because I have in my mind that it has ancient ties to the Duchy of Wisford
[2024-01-04 09:47 PM] Deciusmus: The big duchies are a better example
[2024-01-04 09:47 PM] Deciusmus: But yes, I agree
[2024-01-04 09:48 PM] Deciusmus: I think at some level, the lich is trying to get the six duchies to each one declare indepedence from Sembara and destroy the sembaran crown that way
[2024-01-04 09:49 PM] Deciusmus: The first step is to get Wisford, which I think is one of the most powerful duchies, to suceed
[2024-01-04 09:49 PM] rsulfuratus: I think an interesting historical model is actually in a way the early modern Spanish crown
[2024-01-04 09:49 PM] Deciusmus: Right with land and stuff all over the place?
[2024-01-04 09:50 PM] rsulfuratus: no I was thinking you have castile, aragon, etc
[2024-01-04 09:50 PM] rsulfuratus: they are unified and all owe allegiance to the same king but also you have powerful local power bases
[2024-01-04 09:51 PM] Deciusmus: ah
[2024-01-04 09:51 PM] Deciusmus: right before the hapsburgs
[2024-01-04 09:51 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-01-04 09:51 PM] rsulfuratus: like 1500s
[2024-01-04 09:52 PM] rsulfuratus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_monarchy
[2024-01-04 09:53 PM] Deciusmus: Right although I dont actually want to make up 6 different sets of taxes and laws and such 🙂
[2024-01-04 09:54 PM] rsulfuratus: right I wouldn't go to that extreme
[2024-01-04 09:54 PM] rsulfuratus: you just need vibes
[2024-01-04 09:54 PM] rsulfuratus: basically the point is the Duke of Wisford is an important person with independent power
[2024-01-04 09:54 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-01-04 09:54 PM] Deciusmus: And in fact, in a weird position right now, because their historic influence over the southern Enst border has waned significantly
[2024-01-04 09:55 PM] Deciusmus: Because after Wisford bore the brunt of the Shattered Ice Clan attacks, and then Cece's resettlement was focused on crown loyalists
[2024-01-04 09:56 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-01-04 09:56 PM] Deciusmus: And actually I have it in my plan that the baron of Aveil is actually working for the lich or controlled by the lich or something
[2024-01-04 09:56 PM] Deciusmus: Which works really well to isolate Wisford
[2024-01-04 09:57 PM] Deciusmus: And then, on top of that:
    * Wisford has close ties to the lizardfolk of Ozabal Swamp
    * Fellburn was a center of a lot of battles, so there are a lot of dead. It is going to suffer a lot more form the raise 0.5% of dead than many places
[2024-01-04 09:58 PM] Deciusmus: Anyway, I agree with all of that
[2024-01-04 09:58 PM] Deciusmus: The other point I was going for in my thinking above is that the southern and western baronies are basically "new" from Cece's reign
[2024-01-04 09:59 PM] Deciusmus: And the southern borderlands in particular have grown a lot - good farmland then, and a sense of economic possibilities..
[2024-01-04 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus: right, I think those baronies would have largely (entirely?) been personal possessions of the crown
[2024-01-04 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus: whether that is still true in 1750 can be an open question
[2024-01-04 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, after reconquest, for sure
[2024-01-04 10:01 PM] Deciusmus: But I think Cece gifted a lot of of them out
[2024-01-04 10:01 PM] Deciusmus: And probably in the chaos after the lich dies Wisford gets back some level of control
[2024-01-04 10:02 PM] Deciusmus: especially because the next queen is Elaine II who is strongly Tyrwinghan
[2024-01-04 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: and so I think in 1750, its more balanced -- the crown has more wealth and resources partly from an expanded royal demense in the south, but also at least some of the barons are currently back in the Wisford orbit
[2024-01-04 10:03 PM] Deciusmus: but I'm not sure it matters much, its all a peaceful land these days. The action is in Adderfell / March of Andonne / Aurbez
[2024-01-04 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess I was thinking Maseau might have gained at the expense of Wisford
[2024-01-04 10:05 PM] Deciusmus: yeah that is possible as well
[2024-01-04 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway doesn't really matter for now
[2024-01-04 10:06 PM] Deciusmus: true
[2024-01-04 10:06 PM] Deciusmus: Oh, one last thought -- I'm trying to figure out when the western wall was built
[2024-01-04 10:06 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking maybe recently -- during Cece's reign, by dwarves, with some magical assistance from Tollen
[2024-01-04 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that works. I am pretty sure I explicitly imagined the wall was *not* there for the stone titan one shot
[2024-01-04 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus: and then it wouldn't have really made sense as a place to build a wall during the hobgoblin occupation
[2024-01-04 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus: so I would probably put it ~1660-1670
[2024-01-04 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus: I would also make it more magical
[2024-01-04 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus: it is not just with the help of dwarves, it is with the help of stone giants
[2024-01-04 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus: or something like that
[2024-01-04 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus: or earth elementals
[2024-01-04 10:15 PM] Deciusmus: right, I like elementals more than stone giants. But yeah, good point
[2024-01-04 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus: it might not really matter exactly. maybe there are lots of rumors
[2024-01-04 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe cece found a ring of three wishes and wished for a wall
[2024-01-04 10:17 PM] Deciusmus: ooh, I like that
[2024-01-04 10:17 PM] Deciusmus: maybe Cece stole a ring of three wishs from the lich
[2024-01-04 10:17 PM] Deciusmus: before he was a lich
[2024-01-04 10:18 PM] rsulfuratus: only potential flavor issue there is a ring of three wishes is about as arcane magic as arcane magic gets
[2024-01-04 10:18 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, true
[2024-01-04 10:19 PM] Deciusmus: although maybe it was Cece's secret
