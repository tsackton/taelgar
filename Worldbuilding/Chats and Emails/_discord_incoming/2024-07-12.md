# Discord DM – 2024-07-12

[2024-07-12 12:04 PM] Deciusmus: I've been playing around a bit with https://dicecloud.com/ as an alternative to D&D Beyond (because I find homebrewing in D&D beyond annoying and my players have a bit of an anti-WOTC vibe, so we were talking about alternatives)...
    
    And it got me thinking about languages a little bit. In my game, I have a house rule that makes it much easier to have new languages and learn new languages, so I was thinking refactoring the language docs a bit
[2024-07-12 12:06 PM] Deciusmus: the idea would be to
    (a) rewrite the Species/Languages doc to be more "in-world" but include the "real-world mappings" where they are relatively canonical
    (b) potentially create a Mechanics/Language Rules that defines which sets of languages are "related" for D&D language purposes
[2024-07-12 12:06 PM] Deciusmus: (the ultimate goal would be to let my players select languages from the full set in Species/Languages, i.e. I'm sure that Celyn (kiya's PC) speaks both Tyrwinghan and Sembaran...)
[2024-07-12 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah there is definitely a bit of tension in the current doc between mechanics and in-world lore
[2024-07-12 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus: i think that seems worthwhile
[2024-07-12 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus: to be honest though I'm not sure that I find languages mechanically very interesting - your party always seems to complain when you can't speak to people and it usually just doesn't seem to be worth the hassle
[2024-07-12 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus: which might suggest it would be worthwhile to actually be a bit broader about language groupings - e.g. if you understand any of the post-Drankorian languages you can understand all of them
[2024-07-12 12:22 PM] Deciusmus: Languages are mechanically more interesting when they are easier to learn
[2024-07-12 12:22 PM] Deciusmus: My complaint with D&D languages is not that they exist but that by RAW you cannot ever learn new ones. I made a house rule where you can learn a new language every other level
[2024-07-12 12:23 PM] Deciusmus: But there is an alternative where it just doesn’t make sense to distinguish other than between broad language families
[2024-07-12 12:25 PM] Deciusmus: My intention in the doc is have language families well defined “in world” (and probably at 2 levels) so it would be easy to have a mechanic that says D&D language X is all languages I. family Y
[2024-07-12 12:25 PM] Deciusmus: More later going to get lunch
[2024-07-12 12:25 PM] Deciusmus: Btw Z wants to make sure you guys bring home his stuffed animal
[2024-07-12 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: What language do you think Tollenders speak natively?
[2024-07-12 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: Sembaran? Something else?
[2024-07-12 02:13 PM] Deciusmus: probably Sembaran, right?
[2024-07-12 02:13 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, Sembaran
[2024-07-12 02:18 PM] rsulfuratus: I think in practice you'd actually have both Sembara and Tollen speaking in the modern day a kind of Sembar-Tollish mix, that has Drankorian, Tyrwinghan, and Skaer influences
[2024-07-12 02:19 PM] Deciusmus: I've actually structured Sembaran names as pretty French/English mix, so it kinda works to have Sembaran be a more blended language, with a lot of loan words from a Germanic (Eastros) and a Romance (Westros)
[2024-07-12 02:20 PM] Deciusmus: I'm less sure about Tyrwinghan influence. I see Tyrwinghan as kinda like modern Welsh or Irish -- most people speak Sembaran, it kinda surives in backwaters but didn't have a ton of influence on the larger devellopment of Sembaran
[2024-07-12 02:21 PM] rsulfuratus: but where does Tyrwinghan come from? I always imagined it as "old" - e.g. retaining some mariner elements
[2024-07-12 02:21 PM] Deciusmus: Although historically, it is more than it surived as an ancient tongue during the Drankorian years, and I think the "Tyrwinghan Drankorian" and the "Sembaran Drankorian" evolved together into "Sembaran"
[2024-07-12 02:21 PM] rsulfuratus: so more similar perhaps to Skaer than anything else
[2024-07-12 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: while some people in Tyrwinghan still speak the ancient language as well
[2024-07-12 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: or maybe only
[2024-07-12 02:22 PM] rsulfuratus: but pre-Drankor, I think the "northern mariners" which are basically Tyrwingha, Skaer, and Highlanders are all speaking probably similar-ish languages, aren't they?
[2024-07-12 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: yes, although I'm not sure if it is necessary to decide if Tyrwinghan has some unique influence.
[2024-07-12 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, of course
[2024-07-12 02:25 PM] Deciusmus: Kiya has gotten into the "its Welsh" so that's pretty canon at this point. Welsh has a nice property of being Indo-European but neither Germanic/Slavic (which is my model for Eastros) nor Romance (for Westros).
    
    But also the mapping from Taelgar to human languages doesn't have to be exactly perfect in terms of language families.
    
    In general, I've tried to leave undecided the question of who exactly the ancient Tyrwinghans were
[2024-07-12 02:25 PM] Deciusmus: Also is Skaer and Zimvoka really similar? I thought of Zimkova as Northern not Eastern
[2024-07-12 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: yes the original naming Tyrwingha is very Welsh influenced
[2024-07-12 02:26 PM] rsulfuratus: I guess Zimkova is fairly northern, yes. it is more Vostok that is mixed, but I think Tollen would fall into the kind of "mixed northern/mariner" lineage when originally settled
[2024-07-12 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: the language in the western green sea is actually kinda complex, as it is the only place I think where we have a melting pot of all 3 major (defined) human exoduses from Hkar
[2024-07-12 02:27 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-07-12 02:29 PM] Deciusmus: there probably should be an ancient tongue that was once spoken in the coastlands of the western green sea that was derived from Eastros/Northern tongue
[2024-07-12 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: I think actually the Eastros / Westros / Northros / Southros or whatever might be worth retconning, I'm sure no player cares about that
[2024-07-12 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: `*`the names I mean
[2024-07-12 02:30 PM] Deciusmus: sure
[2024-07-12 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: my idea has always been that on Hkar, there was just one language, Human. like there is just elvish, just dwarvish, etc
[2024-07-12 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: but each migration started a new language family
[2024-07-12 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: in the doc I'm writing I eliminated Southros entirely (as "not canon yet") and "retconned" Eastros/Westros/Northros as Drankorian words for different languages they observed
[2024-07-12 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: but they would be speaking westros themselves
[2024-07-12 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: eastros and northros make sense
[2024-07-12 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: right, westros is a bit weird
[2024-07-12 02:31 PM] Deciusmus: because it would have just been Drankorian
[2024-07-12 02:32 PM] rsulfuratus: so, I guess this is a decision that would be worth considering. I've always assumed that "trade tongues" exist which are like simplified versions of actual languages and are represented mechanically by Common (with Eastros and Northros being "other language family" equivalents)
[2024-07-12 02:32 PM] rsulfuratus: but this would be distinct from actual langauges
[2024-07-12 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: here's what I wrote:
    
    ## Trade Languages
    Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. Many non-human creatures also know trade languages, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. Trade tongues are best thought of as pidgins, and they rarely allow for the full nuance of a native tongue. There are two trade tongues in common usage:
    
    - `**`Westros**: Sometimes also called simply `**`Common**, this is a pidgin heavily derived from Drankorian, but with numerous loan words from Chardonian, Sembaran, and other languages of the Westros language family. It is particularly wildly known in Dunmar and amongst travelers and traders across all the regions that were once part of the Drankorian Empire. This tongue is commonly spoken by travelling non-humans as well.
    - `**`Eastros**: A trade token derived from the languages of the Eastros language family, it is widely spoken in the eastern Green Sea, and can be heard as far west as Tollen and Cymea, and even occasionally in the port cities of Sembara. It is very rare outside the Green Sea region.
[2024-07-12 02:33 PM] Deciusmus: based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca
[2024-07-12 02:34 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, that is good
[2024-07-12 02:34 PM] rsulfuratus: might want to fiddle with names
[2024-07-12 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: I think I'm renaming the "Westros Language Family" to "Drankorian Language Family"
[2024-07-12 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: based on the idea of defining Northos and Eastros as Drankorian words for cataloguing languages
[2024-07-12 02:35 PM] Deciusmus: but also agree that changing the trade tongue names would be sensible
[2024-07-12 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: historically these things didn't have very clear names (i.e. lingua franca), it would be reason to just call it something like
    
    Green Sea Trade Tongue
[2024-07-12 02:36 PM] Deciusmus: Western Trade Tongue
[2024-07-12 02:37 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean if we want to be complicated we should have the drankorian version, which is e.g. taught in the university of chardon still and is like the "academic but slightly culturally imperialist" version, and then what the people who speak those languages call them, translated to english
[2024-07-12 02:37 PM] Deciusmus: you mean for the language families?
[2024-07-12 02:37 PM] rsulfuratus: right, assuming the name for the trade pidgin dervies from the language family as well
[2024-07-12 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I mean, if you had a name for the ~Unamed Mariner Language~ some derivation of that would make sense for the name of the green sea trade tongue
[2024-07-12 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: so to a Drankorian scholar, you have the Eastros language family, the Northros language family, and then High Drankorian and Low Drankorian
[2024-07-12 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: where Low Drankorian = the trade pidgin
[2024-07-12 02:38 PM] rsulfuratus: which actually is probably the original trade pidgin of Hkar
[2024-07-12 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: right although I aslo think that _at the time of the Empire_ the pidgin probably didn't exist.
[2024-07-12 02:38 PM] Deciusmus: would Hkar even had had a trade pidgin? I thought it would just be "human"
[2024-07-12 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: maybe there was an ancient "human pidgin" spoken between species
[2024-07-12 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: that say, halflings spread as much as humans did
[2024-07-12 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: because hey, halflings need a language to talk to their customers in
[2024-07-12 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: actually...
[2024-07-12 02:39 PM] Deciusmus: what do halflings speak to other people in
[2024-07-12 02:39 PM] rsulfuratus: well also once people start leaving hkar and languages diversify, there is still for a while a lot of back contact with hkar
[2024-07-12 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: i actually have often wondered if the trade pidgins are acutally halfling languages
[2024-07-12 02:40 PM] rsulfuratus: wellby picked up Eastros awfully fast
[2024-07-12 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: I envisioned Eastros as very similar to lingua franca historically, which was the trade tongue of the mediterrian
[2024-07-12 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: whereas "westors"/"common" seems less clear
[2024-07-12 02:42 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. in the middle ages there wasn't a trade tongue because people spoke latin
[2024-07-12 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: but it would be interesting maybe to define "Common" as a Hkar/original human-language trade tongue spread by halflings primarily
[2024-07-12 02:43 PM] Deciusmus: and so kinda something you might see anywhere, and not necessarily derived from Drankorian
[2024-07-12 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: you then might retcon a bit and say that Drankorian is sometimes also used as a diplomatic language, especially before the Great War. You can imagine all of the big councils between Chardon/Sembara/Isingue in the high school campaign being conducted in Drankorian
[2024-07-12 02:44 PM] Deciusmus: maybe that's too big a retcon...
[2024-07-12 02:45 PM] rsulfuratus: I think from a game perspective I don't love that, because having an ancient language that shows up in a lot of ruins but isn't widely understood in the modern world is a very useful trope
[2024-07-12 02:47 PM] rsulfuratus: what about this:
[2024-07-12 02:48 PM] Deciusmus: I don't entirely disagree, although I think there are a lot of potential opportunties for new ancient languages. But also perhaps Drankorian has faded significantly since the Great War, and is no longer a common diplomatic tongue.
    
    Sembara is largely isolated, and in Dunmar and Chardon, Chardonian has surplanted Drankorian (ala French in the real world)
[2024-07-12 02:48 PM] rsulfuratus: - humans are created on Hkar speaking Human, and there is enough magic in the early days that while the language changes, it doesn't diversify - Hkar is big but people are teleporting and such and so you have just, Human. there are no Firstborn to keep things fixed in place of course, but still
[2024-07-12 02:49 PM] rsulfuratus: - as people start leaving, they tend not to come back, at least not quickly, but went they do it is to the communities they left from. this starts to introduce some language drift - you get both new languages forming and some splitting of "Human" into dialects
[2024-07-12 02:50 PM] rsulfuratus: - the first migrants (ancestors of northerners) don't really maintain contact with Hkar, so the northerner languages feel pretty distinctive (hence Semitic languages as real-world mapping)
[2024-07-12 02:50 PM] rsulfuratus: - (possibly there are unnamed southern migrants that also establish unique languages, or these just diverge a lot after the downfall, not relevant now)
[2024-07-12 02:51 PM] rsulfuratus: - when the mariners leave, however, there is a lot of travel back and forth, however, and you start to get at least two major dialects of human, that drift apart, and perhaps leads to the creation of a Hkaran pidgin
[2024-07-12 02:52 PM] rsulfuratus: - when the Downfall happens, while the settlement of Drankor is dominated by the urban city dwellers of Hkar, they are not all who survive, and the initial empire is somewhat mixed linguistically
[2024-07-12 02:54 PM] rsulfuratus: - then, post downfall, you have three developments: (1) in the growing Drankorian Empire, you have the mariner dialect kind of dying out / merging with the Hkaran pidgin, but the persistance of two languages. Drankorian proper serves the role of Latin, basically, but more like Latin in the middle ages than Latin during the Roman Empire. Anyone educated would speak it and it is the trade tongue, but plenty of "commoners" speak only the Hkaran pidgin
[2024-07-12 02:55 PM] rsulfuratus: - (2) around the green sea you have a fair bit of language diversity, and so you get the development of a true linga franca, perhaps inspired or maintained in large part by halflings; this is what the Drankorians later call Eastros
[2024-07-12 02:56 PM] rsulfuratus: - (3) in the north, there are at this point a diversity of northernern languages, and there is perhaps yet another pidgin that the Drankorians call Northros, but this kind of dies out because the Drankorian pidgin (Common) spreads and replaces it - a language that lets you talk to Drankor is a more useful trade tongue
[2024-07-12 02:57 PM] rsulfuratus: - then after the fall of Drankor, the Drankorian pidgin survives but "High Drankorian" doesn't, except largely as a written language of scholars
[2024-07-12 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: so in the current day, you have Common, which is basically the remants of the the original Hkaran "Human" and you have "Eastros" aka the Green Sea lingua franca, as the only (developed, pending the south) trade tongues
[2024-07-12 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: One comment: I think pidgin/trade tongues should be rare(ish). I don't see any need for example to posit a "northros"
[2024-07-12 02:58 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, that's fine too. Northos could just be the name for the language family written by drankorian scholars
[2024-07-12 02:58 PM] Deciusmus: Also generally no one speaks a pidgin as a first language (that is what makes it a pidgin)
[2024-07-12 02:59 PM] Deciusmus: So what's the first language of the "commoners" above?
[2024-07-12 02:59 PM] rsulfuratus: I think this is like a creole actually. the first language was "mariner" but that kind of dies out
[2024-07-12 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: Right, so per wikipedia a creole is what you get when you start having native speakers of a pidgin
[2024-07-12 03:00 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe it doesn't work perfectly, since the end result should (a) the persistence of a "Common" pidgin, and (b) the development of a bunch of Drankorian-language-family languages
[2024-07-12 03:00 PM] Deciusmus: Right, the main game-problem to solve is why is Common so common
[2024-07-12 03:01 PM] rsulfuratus: so, here is maybe where halflings come back
[2024-07-12 03:01 PM] rsulfuratus: or just non humans in general
[2024-07-12 03:01 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I kinda like the idea of Common being totally unrelated to Drankorian per-se but just a human-derived tongue
[2024-07-12 03:01 PM] rsulfuratus: elves are pretty common in drankor, so are dwarves and of course halflings
[2024-07-12 03:02 PM] Deciusmus: But set aside common for a moment...
[2024-07-12 03:03 PM] Deciusmus: I think there is a clear picture of:
    
    * An original tongue on Hkar (human)
    * Each large migration from Hkar tended to create a new language family but currently only 3 are defined: Northos family (from the first northern migration), Eastros family (from the mariners), and Drankorian family (from the post-Downfall migration to Drankor)
[2024-07-12 03:04 PM] Deciusmus: * A lingua franca, perhaps partially halfling maintained, develops in the eastern Green Sea, and is a common trade tongue there, and is called, by Drankorians at least, Eastros
[2024-07-12 03:05 PM] Deciusmus: Then I think there are two open questions:
    * Where does Common come from? 
    * Was/is there a "shared" Drankorian-derived language ala Latin or French in historical periods in Europe, and if so, is it (a) the same as Common, (b) Drankorian itself, or (c) something else
[2024-07-12 03:06 PM] Deciusmus: Options for Common are 
    (a) a shared Drankorian derived tongue
    (b) something derived from the original Hkaran human language
    (c) something halfling derived or non-human derived that is not specifially related to any human language families
[2024-07-12 03:07 PM] Deciusmus: I personally kinda like the idea that Common is not a Drankorian-derived language at all, but I'm not sold on any particular answer.
    
    I guess from a established-facts perspective, Common was pretty rare when we were out in the east
[2024-07-12 03:08 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, I think from established facts there is a kind of Common / "Eastros" line somewhere east of Cymea with Eastros becoming increasingly dominant the further east you go
[2024-07-12 03:09 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that the halflings are the most interesting through line to everything
[2024-07-12 03:10 PM] Deciusmus: But also, halflings tend to go in routes that loop around, right? I mean, the Green Sea halflings don't usually go on trade runs across the continent from Sembara to Chardon
[2024-07-12 03:10 PM] rsulfuratus: well, some of them do. the Charmhearts for example
[2024-07-12 03:11 PM] rsulfuratus: but, yes, this would be rarer
[2024-07-12 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: I thought the Charmhearts went back and forth from Embry `<->` Chardon,
[2024-07-12 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, you don't usually have halflings going from Irrla to Chardon
[2024-07-12 03:11 PM] Deciusmus: or Medju to Chardon
[2024-07-12 03:11 PM] rsulfuratus: ah, right, yes, Sembara is kind of the inflection point as that is where you go from sea based to land based
[2024-07-12 03:13 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway, my idea about halflings is less that Common is a halfling language, but that somehow interacting with halflings leads to these pidgin tongues persisting in a way that they might not otherwise
[2024-07-12 03:14 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g., perhaps Common is basically the original Hkaran "Human" language, and Eastros is the original mariner language. humans live longer and change quicker and don't have a racial memory to fall back on so their languages change fast
[2024-07-12 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: So you could imagine something like:
    
    In the years after the Downfall, Drankorian spread as a language and for the most part, it was used as the common language across the whole western part of Taelgar.
    
    But when Drankor fell, and the disruptions of the plague and so on occurred, and as the different parts of the old Drankorian empire lost touch with each other, the common language collapsed, and mutually unintelligble languages started to develop.
    
    But the halflings kept alive a Drankorian-derived trade tongue
[2024-07-12 03:14 PM] rsulfuratus: I'm actually thinking the same story but further back
[2024-07-12 03:14 PM] Deciusmus: Alternatively, Common could be as you say, Hkarian/original human
[2024-07-12 03:15 PM] Deciusmus: But then why didn't it persist in the eastern Green sea? Historical happenstance is a reasonable answer I guess
[2024-07-12 03:15 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. Common = Human, and it persisted in the Drankorian empire (despite the spread of an alternate lingua franca) because non-humans, especially halfilngs, kept speakin git
[2024-07-12 03:15 PM] rsulfuratus: one idea is that the mariners left hkar in part in explicit rejection of the urban elites
[2024-07-12 03:16 PM] rsulfuratus: part of that explicit rejection was linguistic
[2024-07-12 03:16 PM] rsulfuratus: so halflings in the mariner-influenced parts of the green sea speak the mariner lingua franca not the drankorian lingua franca
[2024-07-12 03:16 PM] Deciusmus: Right, although I guess Common is more like a Hkaran lingua franca
[2024-07-12 03:17 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2024-07-12 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: Nothing says it couldn't be what the elves in the southern continent use to talk to the humans in the southern contiennt
[2024-07-12 03:17 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2024-07-12 03:18 PM] rsulfuratus: basically it leaves open the south entirely
[2024-07-12 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: So eastros develops as an explicit rejection of "Common", rather than a "natual language evolution"
[2024-07-12 03:18 PM] Deciusmus: I like that
[2024-07-12 03:21 PM] rsulfuratus: right, so revising, I would say:
    - Common = Hkaran, was the original language of humans
    - Northerners left, speaking Common, but the language moved on and their language evolved as there was not much contact, and there was no northern lingua franca and honestly not a lot of halflings up there either, so you get a new language family just from drift and natural change
    - (southerners TBD)
    - mariners leave as part of an explict rejection of urban Hkar and linguistically evolve with intentionality, creating the mariner language family (which the Drankorians call Eastros)
    - halflings and contact with other nonhumans maintains the original Hkaran lingua franca as Common, but humans in the Drankorian Empire speak Drankorian as their first tongue, which then diversifies; a similar process happens in the east but with "mariner" instead of "common"
[2024-07-12 03:22 PM] rsulfuratus: so, I think then that means the default is that any human population could plausibly have maintained Common as a lingua franca / trade pidgin, if desired
[2024-07-12 03:23 PM] Deciusmus: here's what I have in Obsidian
    
    ## Trade Languages
    Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. Many non-human creatures also know trade languages, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. Trade tongues are best thought of as pidgins, and they rarely allow for the full nuance of a native tongue. There are two trade tongues in common usage:
    
    - `**`Common**: An ancient trade tongue derived from the original language of humans, it is commonly used by non-humans, especially halflings to conduct business and trade, and is widely spoken by traders and travelers across the lands that were once part of the Drankorian Empire.
    - `**`Eastros**: A trade tongue derived from the languages of the Eastros language family, it is widely spoken in the eastern Green Sea, and can be heard as far west as Tollen and Cymea, and even occasionally in the port cities of Sembara. It is very rare outside the Green Sea region.
    
    `%%` 
    Background Note: ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ developed as a separate tongue from Common primarily because of the mariner's explicit cultural rejection of the Hkaran elite, who spoke the language Common is derived from. Eastros is in turn a remanent/pidgin derived from the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~. Halfling telepathy and long-lived non-humans are the primary mechanisms that prevents linguistic drift of these trade tongues.

[2024-07-12 03:23 PM] rsulfuratus: human populations where common is rare, or where a different trade pidgin is spoken, should have an explanation
[2024-07-12 03:24 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, I would also add a background note that Common may well be spoken in far flung parts of the world - as it doesnt have any explicit connection to Drankorian it doesn't have to be limited
[2024-07-12 03:25 PM] Deciusmus: added:
    
    Common could reasonably be spoken as a trade pidgin anywhere, and human populations where common is rare, or where a different trade pidgin is spoken, should have an explanation.
[2024-07-12 03:26 PM] Deciusmus: ## Human Language Families
    The human tongues of the known world are broadly divided up into three major language families based on ancient migrations and cultural divisions on the original human homeland of [[Hkar]]:
    
    * `**`Northros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken across the northern reaches of Taelgar, named Northros by Drankorian cataloguers of languages. These languages are spoken by the cultures that departed Hkar in the ancient days.
    * `**`Eastros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken primarily across the eastern parts of the [[Green Sea]], as far west as [[Skaerhem|Skaer]]. This language is derived from an ancient mariner culture that originally settled much of the [[Green Sea]] region, and these languages were given the name Eastros by Drankorian scholars.
    * `**`Drankorian Language Family**: A set of languages spoken by [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and those cultures that inherited the Drankorian cultural traditions. It is derived from the language spoken on [[Hkar]] and the time of the [[The Downfall|Downfall]].
    
    There are some other human languages, notably Dunmari, that do not fit into any of the language familes above, and there are rumors and fragments from Drankor of other languages spoken in the far east or far south, which may not fit into these categories as well.
[2024-07-12 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: I think actually it is worth being explict about Dunmari. The Drankorian scholars might not have written much about it but it is basically the sister tongue to Drankorian language family (hence using the Indo- side of the Indo-European languages to represent it)
[2024-07-12 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: basically the Dunmari (and possibly some others) were the last group of pre-Downfall migrants from Hkar
[2024-07-12 03:29 PM] Deciusmus: I was going to be explict about Dunmari in the section where I write the actual languages
[2024-07-12 03:32 PM] Deciusmus: `%%` Background Note:
    This section is intended to be both canonical and sufficiently vague as to not block new invention. Broadly, the assumption is that each of the [[Human Cultures of Taelgar|migrations from Hkar]] map to a specific language family:
    * Early Explorers = Northros
    * Pre-Urban Exodus = undefined southern tongue
    * Mariner Migration = Eastros
    * Downfall Refugees = Drankorian
    
    Where the minor migrations, such as the Dunmari, would have potentially unique histories, and may or may not fit into one of the language families above, 
    
    When determining real-world language analogues:
    * Northos in general uses Semitic languages
    * Eastros and any subsequent migration use Indo-European languages, with Eastros tending towards Slavic/Germanic, and Drankorian tending towards Italic/Hellenic. Other migrations (i.e. Dunmari) that are after the mariner migration should probably be their own branches of the Indo-European language family.
    * The Pre-Urban exodus is explicitly undefined, and could be Indo-European or something else
    
    Non-Human tongues should generally avoid Indo-European + Semitic, to maintain distinctness but this is not a hard-and-fast rule.

[2024-07-12 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: What language did the Vargaldi speak?
[2024-07-12 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: should they have their own language?
[2024-07-12 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: you only talked to them in Eastros
[2024-07-12 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: (or with magic)
[2024-07-12 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-07-12 03:38 PM] Deciusmus: so probably they have their own Northros derived language
[2024-07-12 03:40 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, I would assume. Jotha was able to pick it up fairly quickly, for example
[2024-07-12 03:42 PM] rsulfuratus: however I tended to use slavic names for them, not that I think it really matters that much. their writing system is almost certainly mariner-derived, for example, and probably have a bunch of loan words from eastros
[2024-07-12 03:43 PM] Deciusmus: we need a name for ~Unnamed Marnier Language~
[2024-07-12 03:50 PM] rsulfuratus: on a related topic, for calibration, in the real world it looks like the best estimates have proto-indo-european spoken between 4500 - 2500 BCE, so like 5000-6000 years ago
[2024-07-12 03:50 PM] rsulfuratus: with a lot of the proto-Italic, proto-Germanic etc early divergenes spoken ~1000-500 BCE, so 3000-3500 years ago
[2024-07-12 03:54 PM] rsulfuratus: I actually can't find my notes in Obisidan about when humans were created
[2024-07-12 03:57 PM] rsulfuratus: ah found it. 1750 per Timeline Notes in brainstorming. so that is like 4500 years that humans have existed, but significantly less time that human languages have been diverging
[2024-07-12 03:58 PM] Deciusmus: well, Drankorian languages have been divering for like 700 years, right?
[2024-07-12 03:58 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-07-12 03:59 PM] Deciusmus: reading about the history of romance languages, it actually would make sense that prior to the Great War lots of Drankorian languages were mutually intelligible.
[2024-07-12 04:04 PM] rsulfuratus: pre Great War there is likely some divergence between the western and eastern sides of the mountains, especially since Dunmar is a clean linguistic break in between
[2024-07-12 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I was about to say the same
[2024-07-12 04:05 PM] rsulfuratus: they are also drawing loan words from very different source: northros in the west, eastros in the east
[2024-07-12 04:06 PM] Deciusmus: So probably you do end up with 4 languages:
    
    Chardonian
    Sembaran
    Isinguese
    Cymean
    
    But Isinguese and Cymean are likely even now close to mutually understandable (i.e. Portugese and Spanish) although Isginuese is dying out
    
    (although I'm not sure what language the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez speaks...)
[2024-07-12 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, that works.
[2024-07-12 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: well, you might also have Illorian in the west, with a similar relationship with Chardonian as Isinguese / Cymean
[2024-07-12 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: Is Illorian drankorian?
[2024-07-12 04:08 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, although with a lot of loan words. Drankor built the canal after all and founded Darba
[2024-07-12 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: you had a note in "Human Cultures of Taelgar"
    
    `%%` Illoria seems like a place that could have a cultural descendancy from the "southern" exodus, although probably not a cultural connection. Perhaps Illorian is a unique language that is more related to Southern than anything else? `%%`
[2024-07-12 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: ha forgot about that
[2024-07-12 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: but I'm not really sure that makes sense
[2024-07-12 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I kinda think it makes more sense as Drankorian
[2024-07-12 04:10 PM] rsulfuratus: or, rather, Illoria was certainly occupied and settled by Drankorians. perhaps there is a unique reason why they have a remnant language, but I don't have a good idea at the moment
[2024-07-12 04:10 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g., there is certainly space for a tywingha-like aspect of Illorian that coexists with a more drankorian version, but no reason to create that now
[2024-07-12 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: on the western branch of the Drankorian languages there are also likely a number of somewhat mutually intelligble Chardonian-like languages that were spoken by a variety of post-Drankorian northern kingdoms, of which Chardonian is the only one that survived the great war
[2024-07-12 04:13 PM] rsulfuratus: and, I do kind of wonder if Isinguese it its own language whether Tollish should be as well, but one that has a very close relationship with Sembaran. probably not worth inventing that much detail though
[2024-07-12 04:13 PM] Deciusmus: I dunno, I'm kinda into making up language details
[2024-07-12 04:14 PM] Deciusmus: I think it would actually make sense for there to be a Tollenish as well, which is where sembaran gets it English
[2024-07-12 04:14 PM] Deciusmus: Tollenish is an blended Eastros/Drankorian tongue with Germanic roots that was historically related to Skaer and spoken all along the Sembaran coast
[2024-07-12 04:15 PM] rsulfuratus: right, actually having Tollish (I think Tollish instead of Tollenish) and Sembaran converge to mutual intelligibilty from distinct roots is kind of nice
[2024-07-12 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: If anyone got *really* into the details, there is probably a southern Sembaran and northern Sembaran, where southern Sembaran is more French and northern Sembaran is more English
[2024-07-12 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: and northern Sembaran is closely related to Tollish
[2024-07-12 04:17 PM] Deciusmus: from a game perspective its all a dialect specturm where Sembaran/Tollish are all the same.
    
    But it gives an opportunity for an "Old Tollish" as an ancient no-longer-spoken language that is not the same as Sembaran or modern Tollish
[2024-07-12 04:17 PM] Deciusmus: and could be where the Tyrwinghan & Vosic alphabets come from
[2024-07-12 04:17 PM] Deciusmus: maybe that's too much detail but it kinda makes sense
[2024-07-12 04:18 PM] rsulfuratus: actually in the very first campaign with Isaac and Nathaniel I had a scholar who knew Skaer but could read old Tyrwinghan inscriptions, so it is dubiously canonical even
[2024-07-12 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: let me write some of this up and I'll push with a status/tim
[2024-07-12 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: made  a PR beause it seemed easier for discussion:
    https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/pull/34
[2024-07-12 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: only done through Drankorian Family
[2024-07-12 05:17 PM] rsulfuratus: Added some comments. Will probably not be back online until tomorrow after dinner
[2024-07-12 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: pushed the rest of the human language section
[2024-07-12 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: I assume you might not see this, but any thoughts on alphabets for stranger languages? (Abyssal, Slyvan, etc). Generally unique per language, or generally mapping back to something i.e. slyvan = elvish alphabet, etc
[2024-07-12 06:14 PM] Deciusmus: ok, I pushed a mostly done version. Needs some thought on how much to make up about non-human languages vs leave undecided
[2024-07-12 08:09 PM] rsulfuratus: meant tonight after dinner, not tomorrow. back online now
[2024-07-12 08:09 PM] rsulfuratus: will look at PR shortly
[2024-07-12 09:03 PM] rsulfuratus: added some mostly minor comments but I think at this point easier to edit via discord + obsidian that git pull requests. 
    
    the two major gaps for me are
    (a) the languages of other planes really need more substantial thought
    (b) there is definitely a cultural thread that feels like it is missing from the history of the west that I need to sort out a bit at some point, but the language doc is not the place for that
[2024-07-12 09:03 PM] rsulfuratus: so i am going to merge
[2024-07-12 09:03 PM] Deciusmus: sounds good
