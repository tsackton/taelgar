# Discord DM – 2024-09-24

[2024-09-24 01:37 PM] Deciusmus: I’m mostly pretty busy with work today and tomorrow but I was playing around a bit more with DM notes and status tags, and I think we are still missing one categorization mechanism…
[2024-09-24 01:39 PM] Deciusmus: Specifically there are a handful of pages that are about either big “world level” things (Mos Numena, Elves) or major regional level things (Chardonian Empire, Sembara, Tyrwingha)
[2024-09-24 01:43 PM] Deciusmus: These pages are all characterized by the ability to have kinda endless spiraling detail (much of which isn’t relevant for a player facing webpage but is useful when making up new related things) and also a somewhat iterative approach to development and somewhat of a potential to be invented at some level even without a game reason
[2024-09-24 01:44 PM] Deciusmus: They are also the pages where “done” is the hardest to define as at some level they are never done
[2024-09-24 03:27 PM] rsulfuratus: I think there are several separate things here:
    
    (1) There is: does the note in question contain enough accurate information for me to run a `[session, arc, one-shot, mini-series, campaign]` there and usefully leverage existing lore? Or separately to use it as background color? 
    (2) There is: is another DM actively working in this area, such that I should discuss if I am actively running something involving this note? 
    (3) There is: does this note capture all the information that has been invented about this thing?
    (4) There is: does this note have a level of detail that is appropriate to its centrality in the world? That is, is this a place that would benefit from invention because it seems thin at the moment?
[2024-09-24 03:27 PM] rsulfuratus: I think (1) is well-captured by status tags, primarily needswork but also active, update and dm_notes
[2024-09-24 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: (2) is captured by dm_plans
[2024-09-24 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: (3) is generally captured by status/cleanup and perhaps status/metadata
[2024-09-24 03:28 PM] rsulfuratus: I am not sure that (4) needs to be marked in any particular way?
[2024-09-24 03:32 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. the Sembara page is clearly not currently adequate to run a game in Sembara without relying on outside information, so it is correctly tagged status/needswork (probably should be more detail but I think there are both shared and external notes). but does it need a separate tag that says "this is world-relevant?"
[2024-09-24 03:33 PM] Deciusmus: So a good example is the Duchy of Maseau. 
    
    The page right now is both (a) pretty thin and (b) not fully up to date some of the latest invention on Isingue and the hobgoblin wars. 
    
    I have some background color that I’ve tossed out in both my Aussons mini series and current game but nothing really meaningful or that I care about being particularly canonical
[2024-09-24 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: And I currently don’t have any plans to send my PCs there but it’s kinda lurking on the border of my game always a couple of random moments of invention away from at least being semi-relevant
[2024-09-24 03:34 PM] Deciusmus: So what’s the right status for the page?
[2024-09-24 03:37 PM] Deciusmus: Or take sembara? What level of work is required to change from needswork to some other status tag? Is a 5-10 sentence summary (good enough for a game in Dunmar) enough?
[2024-09-24 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: I think it needs work. it would be tough - possibly misleading - to try to do much invention there relying entirely on the details on the page itself, especially given more recent inventions in addermarch and southern sembara that directly impinge on Maseau
[2024-09-24 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: I would tag it status/needswork (shared/external/nothing depending)
[2024-09-24 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: and also dm_notes: color and dm_plans: no
[2024-09-24 03:38 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe status/needswork/internal if it is just about refactoring based on details of hobgoblin history
[2024-09-24 03:39 PM] rsulfuratus: my mental test is "if I was going to run a low level one shot somewhere random in taelgar, do I feel like I could reasonably invent a small town and a nearby ruin that would not create contradictions"
[2024-09-24 03:40 PM] rsulfuratus: personally I would keep Sembara as needswork until it reaches the level of detail of e.g. Dunmar which I think is a particularly complete note
[2024-09-24 03:41 PM] rsulfuratus: but if you would prefer finer granularity then perhaps a distinction between "wrong/bad don't use" and "incomplete" is what you are looking for?
[2024-09-24 03:43 PM] rsulfuratus: I also think addermarch is a good example - I basically invented everything I felt like I wanted to know to reliably be able to improvise history/ruins/towns in addermarch, and it is largely all in one place, the note in obsidian
[2024-09-24 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: Yes, I think that is most of it. I think there is a spiraling level of detail, i.e.
    
    Good enough to toss out as color ->` good enough to touch down for part of a session or be used as PC background ->` good enough to run a few adventures ->` good enough to run a campaign
[2024-09-24 03:49 PM] rsulfuratus: so i agree it would be useful to have that kind of information embedded in each note but i'm not sure what the tagging system would be, especially what it would be that wouldn't add a large refactorization workload
[2024-09-24 03:51 PM] rsulfuratus: but also isn't that kind of a judgement call that is hard to pin down?
    
    that is, if we use status tags and DM notes to reliably track how much information exists about `<thing x>` that is not recorded on the `<thing x>` note, then if you are looking at a page that has no status tags or DM notes but is still not complete enough to run in, maybe you need to make some stuff up
[2024-09-24 03:52 PM] rsulfuratus: i feel like the important point of status tags is to be able to see "how much stuff is invented about this place already but is missing from the note"
[2024-09-24 03:52 PM] rsulfuratus: (but this elides the "is the stuff here wrong or just incomplete")
[2024-09-24 03:53 PM] Deciusmus: What is the right status tag for Ardlas? There is basically nothing invented about it, although we had a couple of discussions about highlander kingdom vibes, and there is a bit of deep history in worldbuilding documents about Ardlas
[2024-09-24 03:54 PM] Deciusmus: The other part of this for me at least is trying to reduce the # of items with status tags
[2024-09-24 03:55 PM] Deciusmus: So i.e. if I have a bit of time in the evening I might want to pick a few "status/needsworks" to clean up.
[2024-09-24 03:55 PM] Deciusmus: I was contemplating having something like a status/complex
[2024-09-24 03:55 PM] Deciusmus: for "world-level" pages
[2024-09-24 03:55 PM] Deciusmus: which would just be permanent
[2024-09-24 03:55 PM] Deciusmus: and then if I wanted to try to clean up some easy things you can do status/needswork and !status/complex
[2024-09-24 03:56 PM] Deciusmus: the other thing I was contemplating was the idea of dm_plans gets fuzzy for big world level pages....
    
    for example, take Mind Flayers. I don't have any immediate plans for mind flayers, but I know I eventually want to use them as a major villian
[2024-09-24 03:57 PM] rsulfuratus: I think for Ardlas, looking at the note now, I think:
    
    (1) the main page needs to capture - at least, or perhaps preferably, as a comment - the flavor of the discussion about vibes
    (2) it would be useful to review the wordbuilding stuff and pull a few minor details about who lives there
    (3) it should have a minimal description of geography and bounaries to the extent the lines on the map are correct
[2024-09-24 03:57 PM] rsulfuratus: that would capture everything that has been invented, and at that point i'd remove the needswork tag
[2024-09-24 03:58 PM] rsulfuratus: to me the absence of a status tag doesn't imply a page is done - nothing can ever be done, really - but that working on the page is going to be pure invention and not collating/copying/digging up old notes
[2024-09-24 03:59 PM] rsulfuratus: what is the purpose of status/complex for world level pages?
[2024-09-24 04:00 PM] rsulfuratus: re: dm_plans, I would prefer to be liberal with setting plans: yes than conservative
[2024-09-24 04:00 PM] rsulfuratus: I would definitely set dm_plans: yes on mind flayers
[2024-09-24 04:00 PM] Deciusmus: Right, maybe I am just overthinking this
[2024-09-24 04:01 PM] rsulfuratus: it does occasionally get a little tricky for me as there are some things I don't want to set plans for because I maybe don't want to ruin the surprise
[2024-09-24 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: Maybe the answer is just
    
    (a) add a status/errors ideally with a comment to indicate a page that likely has misleading/wrong information
    (b) be liberal with dm_plans: yes
[2024-09-24 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: status/errors being especially useful as a way to i.e. when rewriting some section of history, go and tag the backlinks without having to spend a lot of time on it
[2024-09-24 04:03 PM] Deciusmus: but as an alterantive to (b) maybe it is worth having, for some more intristictally shared, pages, an
    dm_owner: mike | tim | shared | open
[2024-09-24 04:03 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I like status/errors, although status/factcheck serves a similar role
[2024-09-24 04:03 PM] Deciusmus: right, maybe status/factcheck/minor status/factcheck/major as optional variants is good enough
[2024-09-24 04:03 PM] rsulfuratus: or just a generic status/check tag with subtags:
    - minor
[2024-09-24 04:03 PM] rsulfuratus: - errors
[2024-09-24 04:03 PM] rsulfuratus: - name
[2024-09-24 04:04 PM] rsulfuratus: - mike
[2024-09-24 04:04 PM] rsulfuratus: - tim
[2024-09-24 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: with the implication of dm_owner being less "I have active plans" as "i'm interested in this topic and have been thinking about it"
[2024-09-24 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: so don't go invent out of the blue
[2024-09-24 04:04 PM] rsulfuratus: what is the benefit to tagging that separately than dm_plans?
[2024-09-24 04:05 PM] Deciusmus: to obscure whether you have active plans in dunmar or not
[2024-09-24 04:05 PM] rsulfuratus: ah okay
[2024-09-24 04:05 PM] rsulfuratus: that makes sense
[2024-09-24 04:05 PM] Deciusmus: and also specifically to allow you to tag dm_owner: open as stuff you actively don't have plans for
[2024-09-24 04:06 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean maybe we are overthinking a little bit, although say for example cloudspinner is a good example where I do know more about the downfall of amberglow than I'm letting on
[2024-09-24 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: But there dm_plans: is kinda fine, it isnt' a secret you have secrets about cloudspinner
[2024-09-24 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: right, sure
[2024-09-24 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: but for outer plans, certain gods, big regions
[2024-09-24 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: it might be useful to distingish between
    dm_owner: tim vs dm_owner: open
[2024-09-24 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: species also
[2024-09-24 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: Take centaurs as an example. I have a specific centaur I made up that my PCs might go after at some point.
[2024-09-24 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: It would be somewhat useful for me to know whether you have strong feelings about centaurs beyond what is currently made up or not
[2024-09-24 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the concept is good, and i'm not opposed, but in practice it is probably usually going to be easier to just check in on discord tbh. 
    
    that is, if i do set dm_owner: open on a page, that would presumably be reliable, but the absence of dm_owner doesn't contain any useful meaning and so it might be the case that it is too noisy and unreliable a signal to be useful anyway
[2024-09-24 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: my concern is that i.e. I ask on discord how much you care about centaurs but then 10 weeks later forget
[2024-09-24 04:20 PM] rsulfuratus: well i'm updating the centaur note right now instead of working 😛
[2024-09-24 04:20 PM] Deciusmus: 🙂
[2024-09-24 04:20 PM] rsulfuratus: but if I don't have time, it would be easy to just set dm_owner in that context, or to set dm_notes / dm_plans
[2024-09-24 04:21 PM] rsulfuratus: so i think it useful as a quick way to set an obsidian-based reminder of a quick converastion
[2024-09-24 04:21 PM] rsulfuratus: but the absence of that info shouldn't be relied on to mean anything
[2024-09-24 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: Would it make more sense to just change dm_plans to be mike | tim | shared | none | open
[2024-09-24 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: rather than having dm_plans and dm_owner
[2024-09-24 04:22 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that might be easier
[2024-09-24 04:22 PM] rsulfuratus: although what is difference between "none" and "open"
[2024-09-24 04:22 PM] Deciusmus: hrm
[2024-09-24 04:23 PM] Deciusmus: I guess none really
[2024-09-24 04:23 PM] Deciusmus: none just has a different context on a larger page
[2024-09-24 04:23 PM] Deciusmus: but actually
[2024-09-24 04:24 PM] Deciusmus: if part of the point is to obscure somewhat active plots in dunmar
[2024-09-24 04:24 PM] Deciusmus: I guess the question is... is it worth distinguishing between
    
    " I have active plans for this page" vs "the general region/concept/vibe"  is something I care about even if I don't have active plans
[2024-09-24 04:25 PM] Deciusmus: It might make more sense to just set dm_owner and drop dm_plans
[2024-09-24 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: that might actually fit the goal better... there might be a random npc I made up, where i don't specifically have plans for them, but where I also don't really want them to end up dead in the Adderfell game
[2024-09-24 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: whereas some other NPC, I really don't care if they end up the victim of a murder
[2024-09-24 04:27 PM] Deciusmus: The mental idea would basically be:
    
    If DM_Owner: (someone else) then you probably should try not to invent stuff that would require changing the page without checking
    
    If dm_owner: none, go for it
[2024-09-24 04:27 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah that does seem a bit smoother than plans
[2024-09-24 04:28 PM] rsulfuratus: and is broader and so less likely to be immediately revealing about future sessions
[2024-09-24 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: and it is also nice to be able to flag dm_owner: shared vs jus dm_plans: yes so that I remember you also have plans for something
[2024-09-24 04:29 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-09-24 04:29 PM] Deciusmus: if, I dunno, you wanted Armaund to show up in adderfell say
[2024-09-24 04:32 PM] rsulfuratus: ok, different question. what do you tag a page that is complete (all information on the page) but much of the information is kind of vibes based "how might you roleplay an NPC of this species" bullet points not a proper player-facing note?
[2024-09-24 04:32 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. look a the new centaur page I pushed
[2024-09-24 04:32 PM] rsulfuratus: is that properly tagged? i guess i should actually remove dm_notes as everything is now a comment
[2024-09-24 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: Ok.. I have more work to do.. but to summarize:
    
    (a) remove status/namecheck and status/factcheck with just status/check with a suggested subtag of minor, errors, whereabouts, header, name, mike, tim
    
    (b) implication of check is that anyone can "fix" the page with cross-referenced sources. If the page needs updates from in game info, use status/update (but if it is just xref to session notes, status/check is fine)
    
    (c) change dm_plans to dm_owner. values are mike | tim | none | shared 
    
    if dm_owner is none, it indicates that the page is pretty open. Obviously don't say, kill off all kobolds even if dm_owner is none on the kobold page. But killing off an NPC is ok.
    
    If dm_owner is not none, check in before doing stuff. Sometimes `%%` on the page will give context though
[2024-09-24 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: Yes I think the centaur page is correctly tagged
[2024-09-24 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: This gets back to your "we don't need a status tag for could use more detail"
[2024-09-24 04:40 PM] rsulfuratus: right, if someone like kiya wanted to play a centaur you'd likely end up fleshing out a lot of the commented stuff but it doesn't need a tag to indicate there is more to invent
[2024-09-24 04:40 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2024-09-24 04:41 PM] Deciusmus: And I think I'd lean even more towards barebones for removing a status tag, at least for now.
    
    if a page 
    (a) captures everything that is invented
    (b) is at least good enough that a minor NPC could be from there or something
    I'd call it done
[2024-09-24 04:41 PM] Deciusmus: or rather, I'd say it doesn't need a status tag
[2024-09-24 04:41 PM] rsulfuratus: 👍
[2024-09-24 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: but if you have a stake in further creation and other not-really-ready-to-be-expressed thoughts, set dm_owner: `<name>` or if it is already set, dm_owner: shared
[2024-09-24 04:43 PM] Deciusmus: eventually I could see the benefit in maybe adding a tag like status/lowdetails or something but I would wait unilt we have more stuff "done"
[2024-09-24 04:52 PM] rsulfuratus: still need to work a bit but before i turn back to work pushing a tag update. 
    
    four main status tags:
    - check: details need to be checked, either by a specific person, to correct minor errors, to verify names, to fix major errors. by definition cannot be trusted to be correct. usually will have comments which might indicate okay to use
    - cleanup: the note is correct and complete but that someone wants to reformat it to make it nicer or more usable (e.g., collate detail from linked pages into summaries, incorporate comments into narrative, etc). never needed and has no bearing on dm facing information but might affect how a page looks on taelgarverse
    - needswork: the note does not contain all information about the thing that exists. tread cautiously
    - metadata: the note could use metadata cleanup, or non-text updates (images, maps). should never impact usability, although for example don't trust whereabouts for notes with metadata/header tags
    
    other status tags:
    - unknown: obsolete but don't remove without checking page to set a more appropriate status or remove
    - update: page is actively involved in a campaign and there is recent (or not so recent) session events that impact the text on the page (use metadata/header if only whereabouts need to be updated)
    - stub: page is not finished being created
[2024-09-24 04:52 PM] rsulfuratus: the only one I'm not sure is what status/complex means
[2024-09-24 04:52 PM] Deciusmus: deleteit
[2024-09-24 04:53 PM] rsulfuratus: move elsewhere or just delete?
[2024-09-24 04:53 PM] Deciusmus: just delete
[2024-09-24 04:53 PM] Deciusmus: same as status/active
[2024-09-24 04:53 PM] Deciusmus: delete status/active as well if any are left
[2024-09-24 04:53 PM] Deciusmus: I started to tag "hard" pages with status/complex
[2024-09-24 04:53 PM] Deciusmus: but as per this discussion, no point
[2024-09-24 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: per this discussion, status/needswork/blankslate is probably also unnecessary?
[2024-09-24 05:03 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2024-09-24 05:13 PM] rsulfuratus: would you consider this correctly tagged?

[2024-09-24 05:14 PM] Deciusmus: I think a page that has no taelgarverse facing content should probably have a status/cleanup/internal
[2024-09-24 05:14 PM] Deciusmus: Although I guess in this case, it is a location with a header so maybe not
[2024-09-24 05:15 PM] Deciusmus: But I think it should have a sentence or so of taelgarverse content or get a tag
[2024-09-24 05:15 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i think i agree with that
[2024-09-24 05:16 PM] Deciusmus: ultimately if the page was something like:
    
    A line of hills that stretches twoard the [[North Chardon Coast]] from the [[Elderwood]].
    
    `%%` 100 lines of brainstorming about the hills `%%`
    
    It would be kinda random/up to you whether you wanted to tag as cleanup/internal or not
[2024-09-24 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: but broadly, I think when the `%%` info is >`>` more than the public info it is worth tagging cleanup/internal.
    
    what >`>` means is a bit grey though
[2024-09-24 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: esp as sometimes the `%%` info isn't really appropriate for taelgarverse anyway
[2024-09-24 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: i think it is fine for status/cleanup to a bit arbitrary and more of a "i wish this page were better written" than anything else
[2024-09-24 05:18 PM] Deciusmus: although I think it is useful to distinguish canonical non-public info via
    
    `%%`Campaign:^None`%%`
    text
    `%%`^End`%%`
    
    whereas 
    
    `%%` text `%%`
    
    Is less clearly canonical unless the block of text states that it is
[2024-09-24 05:18 PM] rsulfuratus: yes that is a good idea
[2024-09-24 05:21 PM] rsulfuratus: for this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-48B9D.png]]
[2024-09-24 05:22 PM] rsulfuratus: would you understand those tags to mean: i have nothing invented but i want some control over the details of that road despite lacking any specific information at the moment
[2024-09-24 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2024-09-24 05:23 PM] Deciusmus: or perhaps the logically equivalent: "I have some vague ideas but they are not so well formed as for me to say the page actually needs work"
[2024-09-24 05:31 PM] rsulfuratus: conversely, does this correctly communicate that I have a lot of non-shared information, but conditional on that being shared, i have no particular future ideas or plans for additional development?

Notes from GDrive
#### Emerald Coast

- Needs a name, maybe. Coast of the Emerald bay, southwest of Chardon. 
	
- Ancient, magical canal  ([[Old Chardon Canal]]) cuts through narrow part of the isthmus, allowing seagoing travel, but expensive to navigate for ~to be determined reasons~
	
- Large southern port/trading city, one of the 2-3 largest in Chardon Empire outside Chardon
	
- The northern slopes of the [[~Darba Coastal Mountains~]] are another significant mining area.

[[Yeraad]] river flows through here

[2024-09-24 05:32 PM] Deciusmus: yes. although the combination of needswork/external and dm_notes: important is a bit confusing.
    
I would interpret this as: even a minimal rewrite of the page based on the `%%` text is dangerous and might result in incorrect page
[2024-09-24 05:32 PM] Deciusmus: whereas if you didn't have the needswork/external I would assume the text of the page is basically ok, but there are important non-conflicting details
[2024-09-24 05:33 PM] rsulfuratus: your interpretation is the correct one. the intention is to communicate that I have contradictory (and more canonical) dm notes
[2024-09-24 05:36 PM] rsulfuratus: how about this?

`%%`

- Needs a name - long stretch of smooth sandy beaches running 800 miles north of Chardon
	
- Sandy beaches, leading to land of rivers and farms and pastures, breadbasket of Chardon
	
- Small stands of ancestral forests but mostly land with a long history of agriculture
	
- Land slopes up to low hills maybe 150-200 miles inland
	
- Relatively few big cities; perhaps one or two in the north? Not sure yet about urbanization in this area. Open to develop. 

- NOTE: A bunch of history is worked out elsewhere, including DM notes,

[2024-09-24 05:36 PM] rsulfuratus: is it clear that minimal rewrite - e.g. to remove status/cleanup/internal - is fine?
[2024-09-24 05:37 PM] rsulfuratus: is the NOTE at the bottom sufficient or is dm_notes: important better than color?
[2024-09-24 05:44 PM] Deciusmus: yes; a note that explictly said something like
[2024-09-24 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: NOTE: There is a lot of DM information about the history and population movements in this region, but the map and current day vibe is accurate here
[2024-09-24 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: might be slightly clearer
[2024-09-24 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: but realistically, probably doesn't matter
[2024-09-24 05:46 PM] Deciusmus: or perhaps dm_notes: important is better until we have a "History of Chardonian Empire" page that can be linked and carry the info about the history, including the status/needswork/external tag
[2024-09-24 05:57 PM] rsulfuratus: should I do a find/replace of all dm_plans to dm_owner or do you want to fix yourself to update dm_plans: yes to dm_owner: mike or something?
[2024-09-24 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: what you would replace to? just dm_plans to dm_owner so it stays yes?
[2024-09-24 05:59 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2024-09-24 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: thats fine, although I have some dm_plans:no tat I want to make dm_owner: yes on some npcs
[2024-09-24 06:04 PM] Deciusmus: I just pushed a pending commit I had of some cleanup I was doing lastnight
[2024-09-24 06:04 PM] Deciusmus: make sure to pull
[2024-09-24 06:11 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed. added a table to Missing DM Info called Fix that has dm_owner = "yes" or dm_owner = "no"
[2024-09-24 08:44 PM] Deciusmus: I was just browsing your addermarch session notes and I noticed..
    "that it has apparently made its lair in a place with a strange -- and not functioning -- fey gate."
    
    Do you have any thoughts on what makes fey gates start/stop functioning? Did I already ask you about this?
[2024-09-24 08:46 PM] rsulfuratus: i am not sure there has to be a uniform answer. in this case, the set up was that there were two crystals (presumably originally from the feywild) that served as "anchors" on the material plane
[2024-09-24 08:46 PM] rsulfuratus: one had be damaged, and so the gate couldn't function as it was no longer properly anchored
[2024-09-24 08:47 PM] Deciusmus: I've been playing around with the idea that I might have my PCs get some idea that they could destroy or otherwise disable the portal to duskmire near cleenseau
[2024-09-24 08:47 PM] Deciusmus: as a way to contain umbraeth somewhat
[2024-09-24 08:47 PM] rsulfuratus: I made a stub page for the Kilrath Stone Circle which would be a place where I'd put notes on this
[2024-09-24 08:48 PM] rsulfuratus: this was a pretty minor gate in the scheme of things though
[2024-09-24 08:48 PM] Deciusmus: yeah the cleenseau feywild portal is a bigger deal, although it has already been established as a place that opens and closes for mysterious reasons
[2024-09-24 08:48 PM] rsulfuratus: something like lastlight falls probably can't be so easily destroyed
[2024-09-24 08:49 PM] rsulfuratus: the kind of basic idea I have about extraplanar connections is that they are of two kinds:
    - "natural" connections which occur when the higher dimension space of the planes brings some other plane close to the material plane
    - "anchored" connections which occur when someone drags a piece of another plane to the material plane
[2024-09-24 08:50 PM] rsulfuratus: most things Dunmar has encountered are natural connections - extraplanar weak points, lastlight falls, Arborea ruins
[2024-09-24 08:50 PM] rsulfuratus: these are probably not so easy to destroy as they require reordering extraplanar geometry
[2024-09-24 08:51 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, if it is going to be a quest for 8th level characters, it shouldn't be that easy..
[2024-09-24 08:51 PM] rsulfuratus: but an anchored connection (e.g., the elemental forge) is easier, you just break the anchor
[2024-09-24 08:51 PM] rsulfuratus: right yes, doesn't mean that are impossible to destroy
[2024-09-24 08:51 PM] Deciusmus: in particular, it would be ideal if this portal could only be destroyed from the feywild side
[2024-09-24 08:51 PM] rsulfuratus: just setting up the contrast with e.g. the fey gate in Addermarch which 2nd level charaters could mess with
[2024-09-24 08:52 PM] Deciusmus: which would then set up a whole sequence of... ok, now we need to get home somewhat
[2024-09-24 08:52 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, why not, if the goal is you have to reorder extraplanar geometry maybe the only way to do that is by destroying some feature in the feywild that corresponds to something particularly unique in the material plane at that location
[2024-09-24 08:53 PM] rsulfuratus: altering material plane doesn't work because the feywild just echoes and adapts. have to force the feywild itself "far away"
[2024-09-24 08:54 PM] rsulfuratus: easy to come up with arbitrary logic like that for interplanar geometry, which should't really feel logical anyway
[2024-09-24 08:57 PM] Deciusmus: I think its clear, but a page like this:
