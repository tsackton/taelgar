# Discord DM – 2024-09-22

[2024-09-22 09:22 AM] rsulfuratus: you did a lot yesterday, just pulled the changes. mostly need to finish colorado prep and do a bit of work work today but might do a bit of tag updating and note cleanup in between other tasks, especially sorting status/tim things.
    
    one thing to check - you didn't add anything about status/cleanup to the status doc, is this useful to keep? this is where i've stuck things that need various bits of metadata cleanup as opposed to text, and i see you also added status/cleanup/map to mostreve hills. 
    
    might also be a decent tag to use for status/cleanup/image.
    
    maybe change from status/cleanup to status/metadata? 
    
    so then you'd have status/metadata (header, refactor, image, map)
    
    and move what is currently status/cleanup/reformat into status/needswork/reformat
[2024-09-22 09:26 AM] Deciusmus: I like status/cleanup for basically "this note is accurate, use it as canon, but it could be improved"
[2024-09-22 09:26 AM] rsulfuratus: right, yeah. i guess i'm wondering if it is useful to have a separate "this note could use better metadata (header, image, map)"
[2024-09-22 09:28 AM] rsulfuratus: right now cleanup has ~60 notes that are missing header information, 15 that have various complex metadata cleanup (usually items that are specific examples of a common item that aren't well captured in current metadata), and 11 that are basically true cleanup (text is accurate but organization is outdated)
[2024-09-22 09:31 AM] rsulfuratus: my temptation is to move things as follows:
    - status/cleanup (header, map, refactor) ->` status/metadata (header, map, refactor)
    - status/cleanup/reformat ->` status/needswork/internal
    - status/image ->` status/metadata/image
[2024-09-22 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: I think it’s useful to distinguish between 
    (A) metadata cleanup
    (B) rethink/rework because it isn’t accurate / contents are not right
    (C) rewrite because I.e it is very focused on a specific campaign but the contents are fine
[2024-09-22 10:42 AM] Deciusmus: I think in theory needswork/internal could be used for (c) as long as there is a `%%` saying ie %could use language cleanup, but complete`%%`
[2024-09-22 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus: maybe it is useful to have a separate needswork/rewrite. just thinking in terms of how i use status tags, there is a distsinction between collating information and polishing text and sometimes i just want to polish text
[2024-09-22 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: My goal was to be able to distinguish between 5 types of “needswork”:
    - text polishing and writing/improving where all info is on the page itself
    - text polishing and writing/improving where all info is in obsidian but needs digging or alignment (ie make sure such and such ruler page aligns with timeline)
    - info is scattered between discord/email/obisidian but all shared
    - info is not in a shared source but exists on paper somewhere 
    - info is not in a shared source (usually implying it was used in game/somewhat canonical) and one of us has clear ideas but nothing written (usually implying more brainstorming/future game)
[2024-09-22 10:46 AM] Deciusmus: And then I think there are two other categories:
    - complex page that really needs a discussion
    - blank slate
[2024-09-22 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think those are great categories
[2024-09-22 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus: but maybe we need 1 or 2 more tags to cover?
[2024-09-22 10:47 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2024-09-22 10:48 AM] Deciusmus: I think something like:
    - rewrite
    - internal
    - shared
    - external
    - wip
[2024-09-22 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: Basically adds shared for external shared and repurposes rewrite for anything where the page itself is complete but not in fully satisfactory form
[2024-09-22 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus: yeah I think that works. so what I have as cleanup/reformat should go to needswork/rewrite, and we should split current external to pull the things with notes in discord etc to shared instead of external
[2024-09-22 10:49 AM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2024-09-22 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus: okay, i'm going to push a few changes then that reorg tags like this and add the status/metadata for things like header, image, map
[2024-09-22 10:50 AM] Deciusmus: Btw Z and his friends are starting a new 2024 campaign today and then ended up with bard/warlock/rogue/monk
[2024-09-22 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus: that is kind of funny
[2024-09-22 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus: pushed tag reorg
[2024-09-22 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus: there is still one lingering issue imo, which is that there are still a lot of pages that have no status tag and yet might be properly tagged status/active, status/update, or something else like that. which is not really an issue from the point of view of "is the information in this page canonical" but can be an issue for avoiding branching realities if multiple campaigns cover the same ground
[2024-09-22 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus: (e.g., if your players go to Tollen or Addermarch; my addermarch game goes to southern Sembara; Dunmar Frontier goes to Aurbez)
[2024-09-22 11:27 AM] rsulfuratus: in particular, e.g. looking at Tollen, there are a lot of things that are reasonably complete, in that there isn't any additional information invented, but where i have a kind of vibes based sense of the place that isn't fully captured in the notes
[2024-09-22 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus: it is probably actually less relevant for dunmar places, because e.g. if your game is going to tollen you'd be well-aware that a lot happened in the dunmar game there (and session notes are pretty detailed for dunmar so you can see all the backlinks).
    
    but for e.g. the cleeanseau game, it isn't really obvious to me what parts of tyrwingha are actually complete and what parts are complete but missing crucial vibes details that are important to keep in mind if creating new stuff
[2024-09-22 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus: but maybe this is not something that a tag system is good for and maybe not worth really worrying about. although part of me things there should be a status/complete tag for things where truly everything that is in anyone's head about the note is completely captured in the note text, these can get stale fast if someone forgets to change status/complete to status/update
[2024-09-22 11:40 AM] Deciusmus: (more in a bit, about to start Z's game)
[2024-09-22 12:11 PM] Deciusmus: (They also all have 8 STR, hahaha)
[2024-09-22 03:42 PM] Deciusmus: I wonder about a separate status frontmatter item with values like:
    
    Complete 
    Active
    Blankslate
    Owned
    Complex
    
    Where the idea is this in particular can be used to set
    (A) owned; meaning one of us has a clear sense of this thing/place/whatever that isn’t captured on the page and best to check before making up stuff
    (B) active; meaning this person or location is pretty active in an ongoing game, so page is likely a little stale
[2024-09-22 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: I’m not at my computer was going to look at what you did and some sample pages in a bit. But the intuition here is that what type of work a page needs and it’s “canon stuff” might be a little different
[2024-09-22 03:47 PM] rsulfuratus: i got sucked into tryign to solve a work problem so haven't done that much beyond the initial tag rework, but might do a bit in the next hour (although really should do colorado prep)
    
    but yeah, perhaps the "how easy is this to use in a game" and "how complete is the information" are a bit orthogonal
[2024-09-22 03:52 PM] rsulfuratus: from the "use in a game perspective", i think there are really four-ish things. 
    
    - some things are just background detail, exist as mostly a name with perhaps a bit of backstory, but are free to be iterated without complication
    - some things might have had significant impact on a campaign, but all the necessary information (including vibes) is captured in some fashion in the note, and the creator doesn't have ongoing plans (or if they do have ongoing plans they are outlined), so this is something that can be iterated
    - some things could be iterated/expanded, but there are key missing details (which might be semi-canonical stuff, role playing notes, vibes-based details, or similar) that would make it difficult to expand without further details 
    - some things are central to a campaign in a way that makes it difficult for someone else to reuse without extensive discussion
[2024-09-22 03:53 PM] rsulfuratus: but also I think there is a bit of a challenge, like for example say my question about visual depications of the wanderer. mos numena gods are obviously not in category 4 above, or even 3, but there is just a limitation of how much notes get updated accurately after a campaign
[2024-09-22 03:54 PM] rsulfuratus: so there could be something like "this thing comes up a lot; the details are probably fine and this isn't an 'owned' page but maybe if you are curious about something it may have come up in x campaign'
[2024-09-22 03:55 PM] rsulfuratus: this often comes up for me because prepping for level 15 is a lot more time consuming for than for lower levels and i'm often hoping that you've invented some ancillary detail and just forgot to update the note
[2024-09-22 03:56 PM] rsulfuratus: i can usually guess in some cases just from knowing enough about your game, but if we are adding a status frontmatter then somethig like that might be a useful additional category
[2024-09-22 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: in any case, some examples:
    - Ravignac is cat 1, just a background place. a name I invented to drop in conversation in Addermarch game
    - something like Escobar Garavito (dyer's guild scholarship student in Tollen) could easily be cat 2 with a bit of work, there is a big secret note that is largely background and role playing vibes but really doesn't need to be secret at this point. or, perhaps of more relevance, Caerlynn is roughly in the same boat.
    - something like Torvaine Watch is cat 3, this was the location of the first adventure for addermarch game, but there is no reason it couldn't be iterated/expanded once I get notes in it (Tollen maybe here as well)
    - something like the ruins of Isingue would be cat 4; really until the Dunmar campaign goes there and deals with the ooze it probably shouldn't feature in any other campaign
[2024-09-22 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure this is really that helpful
[2024-09-22 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: I’m about to go shopping but I’ll take a look more in a bit.
[2024-09-22 04:20 PM] rsulfuratus: I am updating status/tim notes and kind of dismayed at having the first ~2.5 years of dunmar frontier notes, plus all great library notes, in OneNote
[2024-09-22 04:41 PM] Deciusmus: A couple of random thoughts...
    (a) I think there is an extent to which different games are just inevitably going to be slightly different, i.e. if my game goes to Tollen at some point (likely) I think some characterizations will end up being just a little different and I don't think that matters at all. 
    (b) I think one of the challenges with here is that there are couple of different things we are trying to do with status tagging.
[2024-09-22 04:46 PM] Deciusmus: In particular, there are intersecting quesitons of
    (a) is the note "good" (i.e. clear writing, complete metadata, consistent with other notes)
    (b) is the note "done" (i.e. does it capture everything that has been made up about this thing)
    (c) is the note "available" (i.e. does it represent something that one of us is planning on using/inventing more of/etc)
[2024-09-22 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: side note: is your intention that, e.g., Chardonian Legion should be `[organization, status/needswork/wip, status/tim]` to indicate that I am the one who has ideas in my head, or should I, having confirmed it is correctly tagged status/wip, delete the status/tim?
[2024-09-22 04:47 PM] Deciusmus: My original intention was the first one, although I think for a lot of things it is probably obvious who "owns it"
[2024-09-22 04:48 PM] Deciusmus: To go back to my list, I think a lot of the confusion here is really about the sublte grey areas between (b) and (c)
[2024-09-22 04:48 PM] rsulfuratus: I think if it is necessary to tag who "owns" something that should either be status/needswork/wip-person or wip/person, or indicated in comments. i prefer status/tim to just be things that need to be checked not long-term updates
[2024-09-22 04:49 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah. maybe status/needswork/wip-tim if you think it needs that level of clarity
[2024-09-22 04:50 PM] Deciusmus: And to add, there are layers and layers. So to go back to Caelynn. The page is pretty good and is certainly complete enough for me to use for rumors and such. And probably complete enough to run a side encounter with her, even, where the details can be a little vague.
    
    But it wouldn't be complete enough for me to use her as say a major NPC
[2024-09-22 04:51 PM] rsulfuratus: right - but there is no reason you couldn't if I added the rest of my notes (which, mostly, are secrets on that page)
[2024-09-22 04:51 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-09-22 04:51 PM] Deciusmus: But one thing our system doesn't capture very well right now is the difference between:
[2024-09-22 04:52 PM] Deciusmus: (a) I have more notes about this page even though this looks fairly complete vs
    (b) I don't have more written notes, but I have a bunch of ideas about what I was thinking about when I invented this page that I used in game vs
    (c) I don't have any specific ideas, but I am attached to this page  or intend to at some point make up more about this page, so run stuff by me before using
[2024-09-22 04:55 PM] Deciusmus: For example Cedric Cyfenwid is a paladin of the wyrdling, now dead, that I just tossed off as a potential background story hook. I don't have any real ideas about who he was, but he was originally built to be a hook for one of my pcs. that doesn't mean I'd be against you stealing him for some adventure in Addermarch (his tomb is sacred to the fey, say, and has some connection to ... whatever). But because I originally had some vague plans for him, I'd probably want you to run your invention by me before using it
[2024-09-22 04:57 PM] Deciusmus: But I think our existing status tags don't really capture that very well. And it is useful to be able to distinguish between say Cedric and Oswald Greensborn, a leader of the rangers who I just invented as a name in an old document, who is wide open for whatever uses
[2024-09-22 05:03 PM] rsulfuratus: right, so here is one idea. 
    
    status tags should only concern whether the text of the page captures (in a clear, usable way) all in-game knowledge of the thing. they are really from the perspective of an in-world encylopedia or something. if something doesn't have a status tag, that should imply there are no factual details that are missing. 
    
    separately, we need another tag to indicate kind of levels of ownership, which more has to do with either future ideas, or perhaps DM-facing information that wouldn't really make sense to include in a note. 
    
    not sure what the keywords would be, or how to implement with a big backload tagging burden
    
    but i agree it would be nice to have, basically:
    - this page is has all the information i have and you are free to use it however you want
    - this pages does not have all the information i have, but you are free to use it however you want (with the idea that this would trigger an ask, I want to send my party to Eskbridge, can you add any detail that is missing?)
    - this page needs discussion if you want to use the thing
[2024-09-22 05:07 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g., currently looking at Kharsan, which is actually fairly complicated:
    - from the point of view of a generic reference, it is probably done, although I have some more details in OneNote that would be better to capture just to not waste/lose interesting details (such as the names and descriptions of all the Samraat Tombs)
    - from the point of view of running a session in the ruins, it is not complete, because I have things like a rough map, that would be very useful if for example for some reason your players decided to go there, if only to save you some time
    - but as far as I'm concerned with Grash dead the Dunmar campaign is done with it, so it is available to use
[2024-09-22 05:08 PM] Deciusmus: Right with of course in that case the added wrinkle that if my PCs went there it would be from before Grash's time.
[2024-09-22 05:09 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, but the map is the same, etc. most of the details don't really concern Grash specifically
[2024-09-22 05:09 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-09-22 05:10 PM] rsulfuratus: like, I have no idea why I made this up, but I have this:
![[../_discord_assets/image-E4C82.png]]
[2024-09-22 05:10 PM] rsulfuratus: re: the Samraat Tombs
[2024-09-22 05:11 PM] Deciusmus: It's a good example to think about... It seems to me that there is a key distinction between:
    * There are *important* details missing
    * There are *color* details missing but realistically if someone made up spur of the moment color details that ended up conflicting it probably doesn't matter
[2024-09-22 05:12 PM] Deciusmus: And there is also a sense of how much you care
[2024-09-22 05:13 PM] rsulfuratus: right, so in this example re: the Samraat Tombs - the only canonical detail that matters is the names and dates of the 12 Aatmaji samraats, plus a few details about Dasa (the last one) who tried to invade Drankor
[2024-09-22 05:14 PM] rsulfuratus: so if your party went to Kharsan, as long as you had the names of the Samraats, the color details wouldn't matter, and none of the color details are canon anyway, since the Dunmar campaign never explored any of the tombs
[2024-09-22 05:14 PM] rsulfuratus: but, if you had similar color details about, say the Barony of Broomecliff, I'd certainly want to be aware, because if the Addermarch game goes there it would save me a lot of time
[2024-09-22 05:15 PM] Deciusmus: Right.
[2024-09-22 05:15 PM] rsulfuratus: it is basically a tag that says, either, "I have DM notes that have important canon", vs "I have DM notes that you might find useful"
[2024-09-22 05:15 PM] Deciusmus: Right. That's a good way of saying it
[2024-09-22 05:15 PM] Deciusmus: And then I think separately, "I have plans for this" vs "I don't have plans for this"
[2024-09-22 05:16 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, I think that is the most useful set of distinctions.
[2024-09-22 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: So for example, two villages in Aveil:
    
    Maudorville. The page is just a raw dump of rough notes I made up during session prep. But this was just a jumping off point to get an adventure hook. I neither care about it particularly nor have plans for it nor have any other details
[2024-09-22 05:17 PM] Deciusmus: So the page itself is in rough shape (its just raw notes). But in theory you could rewrite it based on those notes, adding whatever color you wanted, and that could be canon
[2024-09-22 05:18 PM] Deciusmus: Peydon. This page is not somewhere my PCs have gone and it reads pretty completely, with a "DM" note about a hag that controlled it for a while and a link to the in-game story I shared with my PCs about the hag
[2024-09-22 05:19 PM] Deciusmus: But I wouldn't want you to use it, because I don't know if my players will go there. I made it up as a hook and they might try to defeat the hag. Or they might just have other things to do and end up not going there. That said, you could certainly have a character in Addermarch have left Peydon during the time the hag was there, say, if you needed someone from far away with experience of a hag.
[2024-09-22 05:20 PM] Deciusmus: So there is a difference between "preserve someone else's narative space around this thing, but use on the fringes" vs "you don't have to preserve narrative space"
[2024-09-22 05:20 PM] rsulfuratus: i think the canon vs color distinction captures that fairly well though
[2024-09-22 05:21 PM] rsulfuratus: although canon is not quite the right word.
[2024-09-22 05:21 PM] rsulfuratus: important details vs color details maybe
[2024-09-22 05:21 PM] Deciusmus: Is it worth distinguishing between "writing down" vs "in my head" vs "to be made up in the future"
[2024-09-22 05:22 PM] rsulfuratus: the idea being a page with either "DM notes exist, contain important information" or "I have plans for this" (regardless of existence or not of DM notes) triggers ->` discuss before using
[2024-09-22 05:22 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. for Peyden, I have important details that are going to be made up in the future.
[2024-09-22 05:22 PM] rsulfuratus: i would think of it as two separate orthogonal things:
    DM notes: none, color, important
    Plans: yes, no
[2024-09-22 05:23 PM] Deciusmus: Ah
[2024-09-22 05:23 PM] Deciusmus: that seems sensible. If perhaps a bit of a pain to go and add to 500 notes
[2024-09-22 05:23 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah the question is how to implement something like this with minimal work
[2024-09-22 05:24 PM] rsulfuratus: especially as I have a lot of stuff that has OneNote DM notes but that I don't have future plans for
[2024-09-22 05:24 PM] rsulfuratus: so anything based on e.g. internal backlinks to unshared notes doesn't help that much
[2024-09-22 05:25 PM] Deciusmus: It is probably more important for Addermarch/Sembara stuff than dunmari frontier though
[2024-09-22 05:25 PM] Deciusmus: because that's where direct sharing is more likely
[2024-09-22 05:26 PM] rsulfuratus: right, that's true, and you are also more likely to have a good sense of whether a place was crucial to the dunmar campaign
[2024-09-22 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-09-22 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: And I can guess  a fair bit based on secret notes as well
[2024-09-22 05:26 PM] rsulfuratus: true although sometimes I just put in blank secrets to mislead you
[2024-09-22 05:26 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. an NPC that was introduced "recently" (i.e. since we cut over to Obsidian) without a `%%`SECRET`%%` is almost certainly not important
[2024-09-22 05:27 PM] rsulfuratus: yes that is true
[2024-09-22 05:27 PM] rsulfuratus: (assuming there is anything on the page, sometimes I make stubs before copying stuff)
[2024-09-22 05:27 PM] Deciusmus: Right. I was just for example looking through Tollen humans and there is actually a secret tag on almost all of them
[2024-09-22 05:28 PM] rsulfuratus: many of those are just my notes for how to roleplay the person, which doesn't really need to be secret anymore but I didn't want to just push directly before you met them
[2024-09-22 05:28 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I assumed
[2024-09-22 05:29 PM] rsulfuratus: but in some cases there might be actual secrets
[2024-09-22 05:29 PM] rsulfuratus: and it can be a bit of work to disentangle, so it would be a lot faster for me to tag those all as "dm notes / color" or "dm notes / important" than actually disentangle
[2024-09-22 05:30 PM] rsulfuratus: then if you want to use someone I can do the work
[2024-09-22 05:32 PM] Deciusmus: So what if we said, going forward:
    
    dm_notes: none | color | important 
    dm_plans: yes | no
    
    Then status tagging is just for "encyclopedia" style reference.
[2024-09-22 05:32 PM] rsulfuratus: is it better as front matter or tags?
[2024-09-22 05:32 PM] Deciusmus: I think front matter
[2024-09-22 05:32 PM] rsulfuratus: okay
[2024-09-22 05:32 PM] Deciusmus: but I'm not sure
[2024-09-22 05:33 PM] rsulfuratus: easy to programmatically convert if desired later
[2024-09-22 05:33 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-09-22 05:34 PM] rsulfuratus: as far as dealing with notes that don't have that frontmatter set, I'd propose:
    
    (1) for anything with a status tag, assume plans or DM notes might exist. tag status/(relevant person) if you update to remove status tag with a note `%%` set dm/plans info `%%`
    (2) for anything without a status tag that is in greater sembara, assume plans: yes and notes: important until confirmed
    (3) for anything outside greater sembara, not likely to come up, but I will try to set frontmatter for all the "complete" pages when I have time
[2024-09-22 05:34 PM] rsulfuratus: I am not sure what to do with pages outside gazetteer, people, groups though
[2024-09-22 05:36 PM] rsulfuratus: as an example: for a while I had a lot of notes about dwarven religious practice that were relevant to the baharazel page but only existed as dm notes. 
    
    i guess in this case status tags are probably more useful though?
[2024-09-22 05:38 PM] Deciusmus: So the idea is that you could have a couple of different types of pages:
    
    * No status tag; dm_notes: color or important. The page is complete as it is, but there is another level of detail in dm notes (which could just be "dm head" notes doesn't  have to be written). If the notes are important, probably need to check before going to / meeting person.
    * No status tag; dm_notes: none; nothing else exists
    
    Then 
    * status/needswork/rewrite - all the info is on the page, but it isn't in shape to publish
    * status/needswork/internal - all the info is in obsidian, but isn't in shape to publish
    * status/needswork/external - the info is in discord/email, but isn't in shape to publish
    * status/needswork/wip - the info is only in DM notes, page can't really be used at all other than as a name; once it is in a usable state swap to no status tag and dm_notes:
[2024-09-22 05:39 PM] Deciusmus: I would say that Worldbuilding, Species, and Cosmology is "special"
[2024-09-22 05:39 PM] Deciusmus: and that we are just going to have to use judgement on those, and status tagging might not serve a ton of use
[2024-09-22 05:39 PM] Deciusmus: Things and Time the above should be ok on
[2024-09-22 05:40 PM] Deciusmus: + History to "special" + Events ot "use the tags"
[2024-09-22 05:41 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure I understand when you tag someone? If I update say some random village in Aveil to set dm_notes and dm_plans am I supposed to tag you?
[2024-09-22 05:44 PM] rsulfuratus: i think my idea is if you remove a status tag from something that isn't "your" page, e.g. because the status tag was just collating or rewriting, you should tag the other person
[2024-09-22 05:44 PM] Deciusmus: ah ,ok
[2024-09-22 05:44 PM] rsulfuratus: if you remove a status tag from your page, you should set dm_notes and dm_plans
[2024-09-22 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: So this feels like it would work well. I'm going though People/Sembarans just to set tags
[2024-09-22 05:45 PM] Deciusmus: dm_notes: none | color | important
    dm_plans: no | yes
    
    right?
[2024-09-22 05:45 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2024-09-22 05:46 PM] Deciusmus: What do you think of using "wip" to basically mean: "there is no meaningful information except in DM notes; I need to copy over before you could really use this page"
    
    vs "external" to mean: the info is in a _shared_ external place
[2024-09-22 05:47 PM] Deciusmus: vs "no status tag" + dm_notes: color | important to mean "this page is good enough for some purposes, but I have more DM notes"
[2024-09-22 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: most of the things tagged external are actually not shared as it is largely my onenote library
[2024-09-22 05:47 PM] rsulfuratus: i think status/needswork/shared is fine
[2024-09-22 05:47 PM] Deciusmus: yes, but is that still useful to you?
[2024-09-22 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: I think my point is that we should be trying to distinguish between "the page is useable but dm notes has more info" vs "the page isn't useable"
[2024-09-22 05:48 PM] rsulfuratus: yes it is very useful to me because I don't have OneNote on my work computer so if I'm updating notes when I'm supposed to be working I can't work on anything with status/needswork/external
[2024-09-22 05:48 PM] Deciusmus: right ok
[2024-09-22 05:48 PM] rsulfuratus: but I do have discord and email so status/needswork/shared is fine
[2024-09-22 05:49 PM] rsulfuratus: i think something with status/needswork/external should always *also* have a dm_notes and dm_plans tag
[2024-09-22 05:50 PM] Deciusmus: See.. I want to be able to distinguish between "basic" and "detailed" info
[2024-09-22 05:50 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. take Airion (a random page with status/needswork/external)
[2024-09-22 05:50 PM] rsulfuratus: that would be dm_notes: important dm_plans: yes
[2024-09-22 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: right but also I think that the contents in obsidian right now are sufficient for some purposes
[2024-09-22 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: but actually that is a little tricky because the dm_plans only exist if isaac's great library campaign gets to high level
[2024-09-22 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, maybe not. It depends on how important the "important" dm notes are
[2024-09-22 05:51 PM] rsulfuratus: ah, I see
[2024-09-22 05:51 PM] Deciusmus: Amberglow is a better example
[2024-09-22 05:52 PM] rsulfuratus: actually Airion is a good example, in that there is enough information that if you needed an author for a book of lore about the plane of fire for your party to find, Airion's Tome of Fire (or whatever) would be perfect
[2024-09-22 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-09-22 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: That's what I was going for
[2024-09-22 05:53 PM] rsulfuratus: but if your players then decide to go researching "who was Airion" you need more information
[2024-09-22 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-09-22 05:53 PM] Deciusmus: But if for example, he actually wasn't real at all, I need to know that as well before making him the author of a book
[2024-09-22 05:54 PM] rsulfuratus: right, exactly. you want some sense of "how much can I use the information on this page at face value"
[2024-09-22 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: So there is a difference between "yes, what is on the page is solid/canonical/usable" but there are DM notes that are important vs "no, what on the page is not solid/canonical/usable"
[2024-09-22 05:54 PM] Deciusmus: That's I think the difference between "needswork" and "cleanup"
[2024-09-22 05:55 PM] rsulfuratus: ah, hmm, yeah.
[2024-09-22 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe just separately status/needswork from status/cleanup makes sense then
[2024-09-22 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: there are only 380 pages with status/needswork it would be pretty fast to move the ones that are correct but incomplete to cleanup
[2024-09-22 05:56 PM] rsulfuratus: with the same categories
[2024-09-22 05:57 PM] rsulfuratus: so cleanup means "nothing on the page is wrong but there are more details"
[2024-09-22 05:58 PM] rsulfuratus: and I think crucially means "the extra details don't complicate the page"
[2024-09-22 05:58 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2024-09-22 05:59 PM] rsulfuratus: so for example for Airion, if there is something about him that is  atypical for a stereotypical " powerful mage with connections to elemental planes" - say, he was illiterate somehow - that would need to be noted for status/cleanup to be appropriate
[2024-09-22 05:59 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2024-09-22 06:00 PM] Deciusmus: that seems exactly correct
[2024-09-22 06:00 PM] Deciusmus: alternatively, take Alaric Benec, the Lord Mayor of Rinburg
[2024-09-22 06:00 PM] Deciusmus: I have no plans for him, and only color info
[2024-09-22 06:00 PM] Deciusmus: But the page is entirely blank other than a header
[2024-09-22 06:00 PM] Deciusmus: so because nothing is written, I'm writing status/needswork/wip, dm_notes: color, dm_plans: no
[2024-09-22 06:01 PM] Deciusmus: if I write enough color that he'd be vaguely useable, I'd get rid of status/needswork and leave dm_notes" color
    If I write up all the color I made up for him, then I also change dm_notes to none
[2024-09-22 06:02 PM] Deciusmus: If my color was written done in my internal DM folder, or some email to me players, I would potentially set needswork/external rather than needswork/wip
    
    if on the other hand the color was in a discord chat with you, I'd set needswork/shared. If the ONLY meaningful color was in a chat with you, I'd set needswork/shared, dm_notes: none
[2024-09-22 06:04 PM] rsulfuratus: so generally then I think the implication is:
    
    - if there are status tags besides status/cleanup or status/metadata, the page is likely not usable in current form
    - if there are no status tags, or just status/cleanup or status/metadata tags, and
    
    (a) dm_notes: color, the page is usable but someone else might have useful details to save time. 
    (b) dm_notes: none, the page is usable and you are on your own
    (c) dm_notes: important, the page is not usable for anything other than minor background without discussion
[2024-09-22 06:04 PM] Deciusmus: If all the color was in some letter that I wrote up for my players, I would set dm_notes: none, needswork/internal and add a `%%` like
    
    `%%` see [[ letter about alaric ]] for color info `%%`
[2024-09-22 06:05 PM] rsulfuratus: (this all assumes dm_plans: no, if dm_plans: yes then should always check, I think)
[2024-09-22 06:05 PM] Deciusmus: The other implication (should be) that if 
    (a) dm_notes: none
    (b) status of status/needswork/internal or status/needswork/shared
    
    Then you are on your own, but if you want to do the splunking in discord/obsidian go for it
[2024-09-22 06:06 PM] Deciusmus: (again assuming dm_plans: no)
[2024-09-22 06:06 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess the only complication is what if we both have plans? mostly involves Feywild, e.g. Amberglow / Duskmire and related places
[2024-09-22 06:06 PM] Deciusmus: I think those pages are pretty clear, right? The implication of anyone having plans is to discuss the details, right? so does it matter?
[2024-09-22 06:07 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah I guess it doesn't matter
[2024-09-22 06:07 PM] rsulfuratus: ideally for pages like that we should try to make sure that all information is captured in the note itself, in the style of the duskmire page which has comments with canon from addermarch and cleenseau
[2024-09-22 06:08 PM] Deciusmus: yeha
[2024-09-22 06:08 PM] Deciusmus: I think in shared pages it is just more important to try to avoid dm_note: importnat
[2024-09-22 06:08 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-09-22 06:08 PM] Deciusmus: and in general, the world is pretty proscribed as well... Dunmar Frontier kinda has "first dibs" on secrets
[2024-09-22 06:09 PM] Deciusmus: so it is fairly obvious where there is significant overlap
[2024-09-22 06:09 PM] Deciusmus: in what might be dm plans, and I think it is a small enough space that it is easy to work out
[2024-09-22 06:10 PM] Deciusmus: if you say, ran a new campaign in Tollen once Dunmari frontier is over it gets more complicated but we can cross that bridge when we come to it
[2024-09-22 06:10 PM] rsulfuratus: right, yes
[2024-09-22 06:11 PM] rsulfuratus: i have to go make dinner but i am going to try to push a bunch of status moves (from needswork ->` cleanup where appropriate) and add dm notes
[2024-09-22 06:11 PM] rsulfuratus: later tonight
[2024-09-22 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: k
[2024-09-22 06:11 PM] Deciusmus: I also have to go make dinner, but dana doesn't get home til 11 so might / likely will do more as well
[2024-09-22 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: I'm working on Sembarans & Aveil folders to start
[2024-09-22 06:12 PM] Deciusmus: but i will try to push frequently to avoid conflicts
[2024-09-22 06:40 PM] Deciusmus: A few notes as I do this... 
    
    status/update is another tag that doesn't mean the page is unusable per se; I am using the dm_notes to track how important the update is.
    
    (i.e. a character who has had significant event happen might get status/update, dm_notes: important)
    
    It's really much easier than other status attempts we've done. I might be slightly overtagged dm_notes: color but it is a good shorthand way to basically say: "I have thoughts about this person that might not be here"
[2024-09-22 06:41 PM] Deciusmus: I'm adding dm_notes / dm_plans at the very bottom of metadata, so it is easy to see
[2024-09-22 06:41 PM] Deciusmus: at some point I might update the header JS to flag on the page body somehow
[2024-09-22 06:51 PM] rsulfuratus: here is a slightly complicated one. 
    
    Sir Einrik Arpaad was the commander of Torvaine Watch, was possessed by a cursed dagger, killed the soldiers in the watch, and became a ghost. Deciphering mystery was first addermarch adventure. i have a bunch of notes about the ghost, the cursed dagger, and such that I haven't put in the main note. 
    
    but i have no future plans and if your party ever went to addermarch prior to the events of the addermarch campaign how he eventually dies doesn't matter
    
    would you tag that as dm_notes: color or dm_notes: none or dm_notes: important?
[2024-09-22 06:52 PM] Deciusmus: I'd tag as color and then add something like
    `%%` Become a ghost in one of the early Addermarch adevntures `%%`
[2024-09-22 06:52 PM] rsulfuratus: great, that is exactly what I did
[2024-09-22 06:53 PM] Deciusmus: I had a complicated one as well..
    
    Duncan Rivers is an innkeeper in Cleenseau. I have no plans to do anything with him per se, but the ale  barrels in his basement were being drunk by a somewhat surly fairy. My PCs never figured out the details, and might still go investigate.
    
    dm_plans: yes ? or no?
[2024-09-22 06:55 PM] rsulfuratus: probably would be dm_plans: no on Duncan Rivers. dm_plans: yes on the note for the inn, if it exists. 
    
    dm_plans: yes on Duncan if the inn doesn't have a page
[2024-09-22 06:55 PM] Deciusmus: right, that makes sense
[2024-09-22 06:56 PM] Deciusmus: here's another one. Is it reasonable to assume someone would check the family page?
    
    I have a npc, Jean-Luc d'Aslain, who is minor but I have some important details about the d'Aslain family in DM notes
[2024-09-22 06:56 PM] Deciusmus: Is dm_notes: important on the d'Aslain page good enough?
[2024-09-22 06:57 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, i think reasonable to assume linked pages get checked
[2024-09-22 06:57 PM] rsulfuratus: if both d'Aslain and Jean-Luc d'Aslain are tagged dm_notes: important I'd assume you have some specific to Jean-Luc in your notes
[2024-09-22 07:00 PM] Deciusmus: So I have:
    
    Jean-Luc d'Aslain 
    no status tag, dm_notes: color, dm_plans: no
    
    d'Aslain family
    body of page is just
    A longstanding noble family in the Barony of Aveil with an ancient history. One of the wealthiest families in the [[Auberonne]] river valley.
    
    dm_notes: important
    dm_plans: yes
[2024-09-22 07:01 PM] Deciusmus: My intention is that jean-luc is minor character, but my pcs have met him a few times and I haven't detailed the color interactions.
    
    the dAslain family on the other hand has some complex behind the scenes stuff going on, but the basic sentence above is totally correct
[2024-09-22 07:06 PM] rsulfuratus: so another linked thing - Einrik, mentioned above, was possessed by a cursed dagger. while the details of Einrik's story aren't important, the cursed dagger might be. 
    
    Einrik ->` status/cleanup/external, dm_notes: color, dm_plans: no
    Dagger ->` status/needswork/wip, dm_notes: important, dm_plans: yes
    
    is that clear what the intention is?
[2024-09-22 07:06 PM] Deciusmus: i would assume using Einrik is fine, although to get color from you if my pcs were going to met them; but that the dagger is not useable in current state
[2024-09-22 07:07 PM] rsulfuratus: perfect
[2024-09-22 07:07 PM] Deciusmus: btw, I am finding the status/stub doesn't make a ton of sense anymore
[2024-09-22 07:08 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. a page that is dm_notes: none, dm_plans: no, where only the header is useful could just be status/cleanup/header
[2024-09-22 07:08 PM] rsulfuratus: what would you use then for, e.g. Buruli. current page content is just:
    
    ```
    ---
    tags: `[status/stub, person]`
    ---
    ```
[2024-09-22 07:09 PM] Deciusmus: dm_plans: ??
    dm_notes: important
    status/needswork/wip
[2024-09-22 07:09 PM] rsulfuratus: ah, hmm.
[2024-09-22 07:09 PM] Deciusmus: stub is maybe most useful actually to mean: I haven't set plans or notes yet
[2024-09-22 07:10 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. when you are creating a page quickly to make sure you get the spelling right across a couple of different other notes or from session notes or whatever, and don't even want to set the status flags
[2024-09-22 07:10 PM] Deciusmus: the problem is that without dm plans/notes, it is hard to know what status/stub means
[2024-09-22 07:10 PM] rsulfuratus: my workflow is pretty different from yours, I often go:
    1. write session notes and bracket anything that should have a note
    2. set status/stub and proper person/item etc to every created note
    3. try to find time to go back and fill in more information
[2024-09-22 07:11 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I think status/stub should actually mean "no status info set yet" not "just needs a header"
[2024-09-22 07:11 PM] rsulfuratus: my dm notes are typically organized by session, I don't usually pre-create notes
[2024-09-22 07:11 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, that makes sense
[2024-09-22 07:11 PM] Deciusmus: when you go back, you can switch to status/cleanup/header if that is all it needs
[2024-09-22 07:12 PM] Deciusmus: My workflow is usually..
    
    make a list in the DM folder for session prep
    if I make an image, create a page to hold the image in DM
    if the PCs actually met the person, move page to People
[2024-09-22 07:13 PM] Deciusmus: but anyway, I think status/stub = no one has set the DM info and only the creator of the page should remove it
[2024-09-22 07:19 PM] rsulfuratus: here is another edge case. 
    
    i have a few notes where the only missing information is whereabouts. there aren't any additional useful dm_notes and I have no plans, but their locations at certain times is canonical. 
    
    inclination is just status/cleanup/header with a comment "`%%` canonical whereabouts between XX and YY not captured yet`%%` as it is a pretty rare edge case
[2024-09-22 08:05 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that seems reasonable.
[2024-09-22 08:15 PM] Deciusmus: here's another tricky one...
    
    Lambert Talwrey. He's dead, but the PCs were invstigating his murder. Other than a convinent dead body, no details about him.
    
    The details of the murderer, however, are complex.
[2024-09-22 08:16 PM] rsulfuratus: is the murderer linked from the note? if yes i'm not sure how this is different from my Einrik / cursed dagger example
[2024-09-22 08:16 PM] Deciusmus: right, I guess its the same
[2024-09-22 08:17 PM] Deciusmus: the murderer was a fey changeling, but I thinked both the actual fey and the person she was changed into
[2024-09-22 08:17 PM] Deciusmus: `*`linked
[2024-09-22 08:38 PM] Deciusmus: here's another one I'm not sure on.
    
    Remille Vauclaire. A ranger and low-ish level fighter. Originally from Adderfell. 
    
    no real details or plans, but she is currently on the periphry of key events in Aveil in my game, so always a chance she somehow gets involved.
    
    Just set dm_plans: yes? Or something else
[2024-09-22 08:39 PM] Deciusmus: (the whereabouts tracks her location accurately, but you'd have to know where my next couple of sessions are going to be to know she is nearby to them...)
[2024-09-22 08:39 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah probably just dm_plans: yes is sufficient there
[2024-09-22 08:47 PM] Deciusmus: did you make a page on the de Brune family
[2024-09-22 08:48 PM] rsulfuratus: no
[2024-09-22 08:49 PM] rsulfuratus: someone should
[2024-09-22 08:50 PM] rsulfuratus: i am behind a lot addermarch stuff due to the complexity of prepping for level 15
[2024-09-22 08:51 PM] Deciusmus: I made one
[2024-09-22 08:51 PM] Deciusmus: just a stub for now
[2024-09-22 08:55 PM] Deciusmus: for someone like Tristan, where there are lots of notes but all in shared email, but where I have plans:
    
    status/needswork/shared
    dm_notes: none
    dm_plans: yes
    
    right?
[2024-09-22 08:56 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2024-09-22 09:00 PM] Deciusmus: ok i've finished all the sembaran people
[2024-09-22 09:06 PM] Deciusmus: and for someone like Marcel de Valarin, where I have
    (a) nothing really written
    (b) bullet notes in `%%` on the page
    (c) plans
    
    It would be:
    status/needswork/internal
    dm_notes: none
    dm_plans: yes
    
    right?
[2024-09-22 09:06 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i have something similar for Caradoc in Addermarch
[2024-09-22 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: although if all the relevant information is on the page in note form, shouldn't it be status/cleanup/internal?
[2024-09-22 09:07 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2024-09-22 09:07 PM] rsulfuratus: needswork/internal implies there is missing info in other notes that you need to collate
[2024-09-22 09:09 PM] rsulfuratus: okay, here is one.
    
    Agon, Vola's mentor in Chardon. the note is complete except for secrets. tagged dm_notes: important and dm_plans: yes
    
    does it need a status tag?
[2024-09-22 09:10 PM] Deciusmus: no
[2024-09-22 09:10 PM] rsulfuratus: also: what is the difference between status/cleanup/header and status/metadata/header? 
    
    is cleanup/header just a replacement for metadata/header?
[2024-09-22 09:11 PM] Deciusmus: that's your call 🙂
[2024-09-22 09:11 PM] Deciusmus: but yes, I think they are the same
[2024-09-22 09:11 PM] Deciusmus: dunno if metadata/header or cleanup/header is better
[2024-09-22 09:12 PM] rsulfuratus: i think metadata/header is better
    cleanup | needswork to me imply text editing
    
    metadata/header, metadata/image, metadata/map is non-text editing
[2024-09-22 09:12 PM] rsulfuratus: i am changing now
[2024-09-22 09:13 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed
[2024-09-22 09:15 PM] Deciusmus: here's one.. Avatus.
    
    I dropped lots of hints about him in my Cleenseau game, but all as deep background/history and backstory for why there was a buried fort and/or various hobgoblin skeletons coming to life
[2024-09-22 09:16 PM] Deciusmus: Ultimately whatever the "real" details it could have come down to 1720 garbled, so nothing I dropped necessarily has to be canonical
[2024-09-22 09:16 PM] Deciusmus: dm_notes: color?
[2024-09-22 09:16 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah
[2024-09-22 09:18 PM] Deciusmus: long dead fey:
    People/Fey or People/historical figures ?
[2024-09-22 09:21 PM] rsulfuratus: i moved needswork/rewrite to cleanup and recategorized all the notes with that tag as either cleaup/internal or cleanup/external
    
    cleanup/internal implies you can fix the page just by what is on the page
    cleanup/external implies color details or other non-crucial information might need to be collated from other sources
    
    example: Cavarrio's Chronicles of Drankor needs to be rewritten into a proper source, as it is supposed to represent an in-world book. i have a few notes about possible errors in Cavarrio's work but nothing canonical (otherwise would be: dm_notes: important). but, if anyone wants to do this, it requires at least collating with the "correct" Drankorian history and so is a bit more complex than, e.g., the similar "Story about Hags" which just needs a quick Taelgarification
[2024-09-22 09:21 PM] rsulfuratus: does that make sense?
[2024-09-22 09:21 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2024-09-22 09:22 PM] rsulfuratus: similar: 
    
    Marcella is `[person, status/needswork/external, status/metadata/header, status/cleanup/internal]` with a note 
    `%%` need to fix whereabouts, campaign info, away dates `%%`
    `%%` fix text to change session links `%%`
    
    the implication is supposed to be than anyone could rewrite the text to remove "Felt forced to try to steal from party in [[Session 44 (DuFr)]]," into a dufr campaign block. 
    
    but also tagged status/needswork/external to indicate there is important information not captured
[2024-09-22 09:25 PM] Deciusmus: I'm not sure that is super clear but also not sure it really matters?
[2024-09-22 09:25 PM] rsulfuratus: right i mean i'm the only one who is likely to be working on marcella's note
[2024-09-22 09:25 PM] Deciusmus: what's the right tag for "factually accurate but feels a like sparse"
[2024-09-22 09:27 PM] rsulfuratus: although, re: marcella and similar, the reason to tag status/cleanup/internal is that theoretically it would be feasible for you to rewrite some of those pages (e.g., Marcella, Hektor, other NPCs you encountered) that currently have a lot of bare session note links into something a little cleaner
[2024-09-22 09:27 PM] rsulfuratus: does that need a tag?
[2024-09-22 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: I guess not
[2024-09-22 09:27 PM] Deciusmus: re: marcella I think the main thing is that the external tag implies that the information on the page isn't really adequately complete
[2024-09-22 09:27 PM] rsulfuratus: although if there is something that feels sparse that you know is a page I created, status/tim and a `%%` is reasonable
[2024-09-22 09:28 PM] Deciusmus: So i.e. a page wth
    dm_notes: color
    status/cleanup/internal
    
    feels like, hey, a rewrite will be ok
    
    status/needswork/external
    implies that you can't trust the page
[2024-09-22 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: ah i see so the combination of both tags is confusing
[2024-09-22 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: what is the proper tag for "information is correct but badly incomplete"
[2024-09-22 09:29 PM] rsulfuratus: status/cleanup/external?
[2024-09-22 09:30 PM] Deciusmus: I think dm_notes: importat
[2024-09-22 09:31 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. for marcella nothing is misleading or wrong about the text but 
    (a) the header whereabouts are badly incomplete
    (b) there are additional important details in my notes (dm_notes: important)
    (c) the page itself needs a rewrite to both fix internal linking and incorporate external notes that give more crucial information
[2024-09-22 09:31 PM] Deciusmus: I would call that status/metadata/header, status/cleanup/internal
[2024-09-22 09:31 PM] Deciusmus: dm_notes: important
[2024-09-22 09:33 PM] rsulfuratus: ah, hmm. 
    
    i feel like it is useful for me to have a tag that says "there is external information i need to copy to this page" that is distinct from "i have important dm notes"
[2024-09-22 09:34 PM] Deciusmus: right, see I haven't been bothering with that
[2024-09-22 09:34 PM] Deciusmus: I think status/cleanup/`<whatever you want to use>`
[2024-09-22 09:34 PM] Deciusmus: or just status/`<whatever you want to use>`
[2024-09-22 09:35 PM] Deciusmus: you could do something like status/onenote separate from the rest of the status tagging we are doing
[2024-09-22 09:36 PM] rsulfuratus: okay, so for you the crucial thing is:
    needswork ->` the page can't be used because the information is misleading, non-canon, so incomplete as to prevent meaningful use in a game
    cleanup ->` the page might not be complete in some abstract sense but it isn't missing any critical information
[2024-09-22 09:36 PM] Deciusmus: The main thing to me is that
    
    (a) status/needswork means "don't trust the page"
    (b) status/needswork/`<internal|shared>` means "but the way to fix it is in obsidian or shared email
[2024-09-22 09:36 PM] Deciusmus: anything else is less important to me
[2024-09-22 09:36 PM] Deciusmus: oh, and status/stub means "creator has to finish creating it"
[2024-09-22 09:37 PM] rsulfuratus: right, okay. so i can use whatever status/cleanup subtags I want and you don't really care if they have meaning to you, as long as the "cleanup" / "needswork" distinction is maintained and "internal" / "shared" have consistent meaning
[2024-09-22 09:37 PM] Deciusmus: yes
[2024-09-22 09:38 PM] Deciusmus: It would be good to agree on a tag for "the page has all the details" as well (to distinguish from "obsidian has the details")
[2024-09-22 09:38 PM] Deciusmus: I think earlier we said status/cleanup/internal
[2024-09-22 09:38 PM] rsulfuratus: I am using internal for this
[2024-09-22 09:38 PM] rsulfuratus: consistently across cleanup and needswork, where needswork/internal implies usually that obsidian has the details (as otherwise it would just be cleanup/internal)
[2024-09-22 09:39 PM] rsulfuratus: i think internal just means "in obsidian", shared means "discord/email", external means "something only the creator can access"
[2024-09-22 09:40 PM] rsulfuratus: but I think generally cleanup/internal should be reserved for "rewrite the page without external references"
[2024-09-22 09:40 PM] Deciusmus: there are a few pages where we both might have dm notes.. i.e. the Rangers
[2024-09-22 09:40 PM] Deciusmus: I guess earlier we said we'd try to keep the notes in obsidian for those
[2024-09-22 09:41 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah, i think okay to see how things shake out a bit
[2024-09-22 09:41 PM] rsulfuratus: if we find there are tags that don't make sense or are unclear can just refactor easily with the tag manager in obsidian
[2024-09-22 09:43 PM] rsulfuratus: also we should try to check the needswork pages to clean up the ones that don't actually need work (in general, i would assume that if a page has a dm_notes/dm_plans frontmatter the status tag is correct, if not then maybe not)
[2024-09-22 09:43 PM] Deciusmus: I've been fixing status tags as a I go
[2024-09-22 09:43 PM] Deciusmus: I aslos added a missing dm info page in MoC
[2024-09-22 09:43 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah i saw
[2024-09-22 09:44 PM] Deciusmus: I wonder if there is use in having something like a dm_notes: shared
[2024-09-22 09:44 PM] Deciusmus: for pages we know we are both going to be potentially referencing, i.e. Shattered Ice Clan, Rangers, some Feywild stuff
[2024-09-22 09:45 PM] rsulfuratus: i mean that should never really happen, if we both have dm_notes we should be doing it in  comments on the page, or in worldbuilding if particularly complex
    
    a dm_plans: `[clee, adm]` might be useful though?
[2024-09-22 09:46 PM] rsulfuratus: dm_notes: color|important|none is a logical OR operation. if either of us have dm notes it gets set to the highest level
[2024-09-22 09:46 PM] rsulfuratus: with the goal of eventually moving all DM notes to `%%` for shared things
[2024-09-22 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: but I guess if it is useful to track where that hasn't happened yet, dm_notes: shared could be good?
[2024-09-22 09:47 PM] rsulfuratus: or if it useful to track places where there are multiple `%%` canon from XXX `%%` notes?
[2024-09-22 09:48 PM] rsulfuratus: but in some ways plans are better - e.g. if your PCs go to adderfell, setting dm_plans: `[clee]` and tagging status/tim is a good way to mark that I need to dump anything useful, but really discord is best for this
[2024-09-22 10:00 PM] Deciusmus: yeah
[2024-09-22 10:01 PM] Deciusmus: probably lets stick with what we agreed and not overthink fo rnow
[2024-09-22 10:22 PM] Deciusmus: I'm stopping for the night: one last thought.
    
    I'm using "needswork/shared" as a rough shorthand for pages that I created originally but where I have no particular information, but also where the info in obsidian is inadequate, i.e. the highland kingdoms
[2024-09-22 10:23 PM] Deciusmus: I also think that "PCs will go to a place at some point" is not a good reason for dm_plans: yes
