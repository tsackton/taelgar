[2023-01-18 11:26 PM] rsulfuratus: seems like a whereabouts bug -- not sure why this doesn't an originally from line:

[2023-01-18 11:27 PM] rsulfuratus: but this does:

[2023-01-18 11:27 PM] rsulfuratus: difference is whether born is undefined
[2023-01-18 11:31 PM] rsulfuratus: (also when you set a born date, it updates 0001-01-01 but not 0001-01-02
[2023-01-18 11:35 PM] rsulfuratus: another minor thing - if the only whereabouts locations are excursions, the header should be "Currently..." instead of "Based..." (e.g. for people with no home base, such as many halflings)
[2023-01-18 11:37 PM] rsulfuratus: currently this gives you "(unknown location)"
[2023-01-18 11:41 PM] rsulfuratus: (think I fixed the last one)
[2023-01-18 11:43 PM] rsulfuratus: the undefined born bug I can't figure out though
