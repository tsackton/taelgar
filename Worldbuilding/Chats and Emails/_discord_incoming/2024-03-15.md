# Discord DM – 2024-03-15

[2024-03-15 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus: been doing a little bit of NPC note cleanup, in part motivated by the cref option in midjourney making it easier to update old images to better quality new ones, which has motivated me to reorganize status tags a bit. 
    
    curious what you feel the most useful things to track are and what is most important to be "canonical/shared" vs what we can use independently.
    
    so far I am working from the following things I want to track, although this may be too fine grained and some of these can be combined:
    
    ## Needs Header Work or Reformatting
    
    1) pages with complete text, but that need header information filled in from session notes or timelines (typically whereabouts and/or campaign info)
    2) pages with complete text, but have complications that cannot be fully captured with the current header setup (e.g. a person who the party met as a ghost/undead but also has information about their past life)
    3) pages with complete text, but which is not in the most useful format (e.g., history pages that would be better reorganized as a timeline)
    
    ## Needs Text
    
    4) pages that need work on the text, where crucial details remain to be invented and so should not be considered complete
    5) pages that need work on the text, where crucial details need to be copied from DM notes, session notes, or other notes
    
    ## Needs Verification / Validation
    
    6) pages that need to be fact checked against other canonical information
    7) pages with a name that needs consideration before it is considered canonical
    8) pages that need a look over from someone else
    
    ## Other
    
    9) pages that it would be nice to have an image or images for
    10) empty pages that need basic header information
    11) empty pages that need actual text
[2024-03-15 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus: some of these we already have good tags for (6 - status/factcheck, 7 - status/namecheck, 8 - status/tim, status/mike)
[2024-03-15 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus: 9 - status/image
    10 - status/stub
[2024-03-15 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus: currently status/refactor is kind of both 2+3, and I'd like to split it to status/refactor (2) and status/reformat (3)
[2024-03-15 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus: both status/internal and status/collate basically represent 1, and are used inconsistently. I would replace with status/header (or similar) to represent pages that are missing header details
[2024-03-15 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus: I would propose:
    - status/blankslate for 11
    - status/needswork for 4+5; probably don't need to distinguish, but if we want to, could use status/needswork/`<>` where `<>` could be notes, internal, wip (for "non-Obsidian info", "Obsidian info", "needs invention")
[2024-03-15 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus: I would also argue that status tags don't make sense for Campaigns and Worldbuilding, excepting maybe Worldbuilding/Background
[2024-03-15 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: I think the main thing id suggest is to try for 2 levels with the 2nd level optional
[2024-03-15 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: I’d don’t care as much about the fine grained stuff as you
[2024-03-15 12:55 PM] Deciusmus: For me the main things are:
    The page needs work or invention
    This page is mostly complete but needs some “cleanup”
    This page is basically just a name placeholder
[2024-03-15 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: I wonder if something like
    Status/cleanup
    Status/needswork
    Status/stub
    
    And then sub levels like
    Status/cleanup/facts
    Status/cleanup/header 
    Etc
[2024-03-15 12:58 PM] Deciusmus: Cleanup means “reasonable complete, should be considered canonicalish”
[2024-03-15 12:59 PM] Deciusmus: Needswork means “missing large gaps. The information here is still being developed”
[2024-03-15 01:00 PM] rsulfuratus: sure, okay, that works well
[2024-03-15 01:00 PM] Deciusmus: Stub means: this is an empty page, I (the creator of the page) don’t really have any ideas about it other than the name
[2024-03-15 01:00 PM] Deciusmus: Then keep factcheck namecheck mike tim as separate
[2024-03-15 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: right, so the top level would be:
    stub
    factcheck
    namecheck
    mike
    tim
    cleanup
    needswork
[2024-03-15 01:01 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah
[2024-03-15 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: that works for me
[2024-03-15 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: oh, also, I'd like to add a status/image as a toplevel tag
[2024-03-15 01:02 PM] Deciusmus: Why not status/cleanup/image?
[2024-03-15 01:02 PM] Deciusmus: Although I don’t care either way
[2024-03-15 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: running stuff through midjourney is very easy to do when I'm e.g. on a boring meeting on Zoom
[2024-03-15 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: so to me it feels pretty distinct from other cleanup tasks
[2024-03-15 01:03 PM] Deciusmus: Sure, either way
[2024-03-15 01:03 PM] rsulfuratus: which typically involve collating information across notes which involves a lot more concentration
[2024-03-15 03:54 PM] rsulfuratus: do you know of a way to get the word count of a note in dataview or dataviewJS? I want to make a query to find highly linked notes with litte/no text
[2024-03-15 03:54 PM] Deciusmus: I'm sure there is a way to do it in js
[2024-03-15 03:54 PM] Deciusmus: but I don't know offhand
[2024-03-15 03:54 PM] rsulfuratus: maybe I will poke around a bit
[2024-03-15 03:57 PM] rsulfuratus: there are a lot of things tagged "status/stub" that have complete headers but no other text. I think these are left over from old uses of stub, as by the current definition stub should mean "this page needs a header". I am planning on removing the stub tag from pages with complete headers, even if they have litte/no text, unless you object
[2024-03-15 04:00 PM] Deciusmus: I think it might be worth reviewing to make sure status/stub doesn't need to be status/needswork
[2024-03-15 04:00 PM] Deciusmus: i.e. Duchy of Wisford should be status/needswork, not status/stub
[2024-03-15 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: whereas The Salty Squid is probably just "remove the tag" unless you have some notes on the place
[2024-03-15 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: things that also have status/unknown fine to just remove
[2024-03-15 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: it would really only be a page that has ONLY status/stub where it is obviously something that should have more info
[2024-03-15 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: I am actually trying to just clear all the status/stub pages by adding headers to things that are missing them, and then adding status/needswork as relevant
[2024-03-15 04:03 PM] rsulfuratus: the reason for the note lenght query is to have an independent check for "short notes that are marked as complete" so I can go back and add status/needswork to ones that are important enough to need text
[2024-03-15 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: right, makes sense
[2024-03-15 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: Do you think that there are more fey (i.e. dryads, satyrs, etc) living on Taelgar in Tyrwingha than other places? Or do you think its more one way, i.e. there are a lot of portals, but mostly that means humans ->` feywild more than fey ->` Tyrwingha?
[2024-03-15 04:15 PM] rsulfuratus: haven't really thought about it. but probably yes
[2024-03-15 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: Kiya, the woman who plays Celyn, the fey-touched priest of the Wyrlding, is busy writing 5000 words on Celyn's backstory and wants answers 😄
[2024-03-15 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: going way back to my first campaign with Isaac and Nathaniel I had this idea of kind of a "fey belt" from the darkwood through the tywinghan border to the lizardfolk swamp
[2024-03-15 04:17 PM] rsulfuratus: I had made up a bunch of like ancient standing circles marking fey crossings and things
[2024-03-15 04:17 PM] rsulfuratus: does not need to be canon but kind of fits I think with how the area has developed more recently, and with all the ethlenn lore
[2024-03-15 07:38 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a major status tag update. i've reviewed all the "completed" pages (except people), and IMO all are accurately assigned to the correct status (that is, complete)
[2024-03-15 07:41 PM] rsulfuratus: the "status/unknown" ones are a bit more daunting, as there are ~750 of them, but many are in campaign directories where status tags aren't really useful
[2024-03-15 08:27 PM] Deciusmus: I'm pushing a change that removes Zovka, but you should delete it from the map when you get a chance
