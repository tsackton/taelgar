# Discord DM – 2024-09-19

[2024-09-19 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus: I've been super busy at work - just looking at D&D now. I think add a comment to the note and tag status/tim, possibly also mention on Discord
[2024-09-19 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus: btw, I'm working on updating homebrew subclasses to 2024 rules. one clear design trend (which I don't feel completely obligated to stick) is to limit the accessibility of half-caster-exclusive spells. hexblade by default has a lot of paladin smite spells on its expanded list. other than banishing smite, delwath almost never uses any of them, so i am considering replacements, maybe just keeping 2 smites (banishing + one other)
[2024-09-19 11:03 PM] Deciusmus: It is mechanically useful to have a non-concentration smite in addition to banishing but 3 smites is probably excessive
[2024-09-19 11:04 PM] Deciusmus: It might be nice to homebrew a themed smite or two
[2024-09-19 11:07 PM] Deciusmus: Yalik'i’s smite of frost 
    1d8 cold damage/level
    Save or restrained (or maybe just zero speed or reduced speed) until end of next turn
[2024-09-19 11:09 PM] Deciusmus: Blinding smite could be
    Nishir’s smite of the talons
    (Effect like poking at eyes?)
