# Discord DM – 2025-08-06

[2025-08-06 08:58 AM] rsulfuratus: trying to work out a bit of plaguelands history. this is say ~1250-1350ish, before Domain of Avatus grows. 
    
    IST = Istabor Alliance. DUN = Dunmar. DS = Dwarves/Stoneborn (Ardith)
    
    at this stage, biggest question is what's in Maseau? maybe nothing, or small freehold communities, is most likely. certainly sembara is not organized enough to be here, but the Great South Road is a highly valuable trade connection (although i suspect at this time Sembara is a bit of backwater and most trade actually goes through "South Cymea")
![[../_discord_assets/plaguelands-history-1250ish-44CD7.jpg]]
[2025-08-06 08:58 AM] rsulfuratus: then, sometime (1350ish?), Avatus conquers a lot of land northwest of Istabor, but also cutting off Sembara
![[../_discord_assets/plaguelands-history-1400ish-A7CAA.jpg]]
[2025-08-06 08:59 AM] rsulfuratus: there is definitely a front along the Westcliff in Addermarch, and I think you have details about Cleenseau but I didn't look them up
[2025-08-06 08:59 AM] rsulfuratus: probably have a line of Istabor castles on the [[Andonne plain]], things like that
[2025-08-06 09:00 AM] rsulfuratus: but the "Istabor heartland" is not deeply threatened by Avatus, and perhaps has a close alliance with Dunmar, who are growing into the biggest military power in the area at this time
[2025-08-06 09:01 AM] rsulfuratus: then Sembara defeats Avatus, but hobgoblins linger in the gray hash mark areas, and this is where the high school campaign begins, with hobgoblins attacking from the mountains into Dunmar and Istabor
[2025-08-06 09:02 AM] rsulfuratus: Then you get the Great War where Isingue is beseiged and eventually the plague blankets the whole upper Istaros and eastern parts of Dunmar, cutting of the Dunmari from relieving the siege of Isingue and isolating the Sembaran armies
[2025-08-06 09:05 AM] rsulfuratus: so questions: 
    does the positioning of the domain of avatus look about right to you? 
    do you have anything in mind for what might exist in the green ?? area before Avatus?
    this sets up Aurbez plateau  especially as having been mostly unsettled prior to the great war - this is hobgoblin territory almost entirely from fall of Drankor to defeat of Cha'mutte; does that work with the vibe of Aurbez in 1680, 1720?
[2025-08-06 09:06 AM] rsulfuratus: an alternate positioning puts hobgoblins and avatus mostly east of the plateau, pushing more agains the western border of Istabor, and leaves space for some isolated humans perhaps living with dwarves/stoneborn help on the plateau
[2025-08-06 09:14 AM] rsulfuratus: (also pushed in flight revisiosn to upper istaros region page)
[2025-08-06 10:17 AM] Deciusmus: A few thoughts/notes...
    
    (a) My thinking re: Maseau has been entirely post-Atavaus, basically on the assumption that whatever was there before was radically transformed by the dominion of Atavus and therefore not relevant to later Sembaran history.
    
    (b) Cleenseau History Notes are worth reading re: Great South Road.  There was a human settlement on the south bank of the Enst around the fall of Drankor, and the Dukes of Wisford controlled Cleenseau region (but probably not south of the Enst) from the 1200s or so (i.e. pre-Sembara)
[2025-08-06 10:21 AM] Deciusmus: the Chronicle of Sembaran history doc suggests fairly depopulated land south of the Enst, with no major human settlements, although that doesn't really have to be canon.
    
    There is a Duchy of Brovna around Ulrich Pass that I have eventual plans for as a historical entity that was not part of Sembara for a while - remember there was a growing link in the 1250s - 1400s Sembara `<->` Chardon through Ulrich, which might have been a competitor route for goods from South Cymea (i.e. Cymean ->` Isingue ->` Brovna ->` Chardon rather than Cymean ->` Isingue ->` Dunmar ->` Chardon)
[2025-08-06 10:23 AM] Deciusmus: I see Avatus as basically opportunistic, gets established in fairly lightly populated place between major powers, and then turns north rather than south because sembara is much weaker than Isginue, especially the western duchies
[2025-08-06 10:23 AM] Deciusmus: >` does the positioning of the domain of avatus look about right to you?
[2025-08-06 10:23 AM] Deciusmus: yes
[2025-08-06 10:26 AM] Deciusmus: (althouh at its height it controlled most of the Barony of Aveil and parts of western Sembara as well, but that was likely brief during the war, not long-term occupation)
[2025-08-06 10:28 AM] Deciusmus: >` this sets up Aurbez plateau  especially as having been mostly unsettled prior to the great war - this is hobgoblin territory almost entirely from fall of Drankor to defeat of Cha'mutte; does that work with the vibe of Aurbez in 1680, 1720?
    >` 
    
    I've always envisioned the Aurbez as somewhat marginal land and I think the historical vibe works, but would Ardith tolerate a large hobgoblin presence on its doorstep?
[2025-08-06 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus: the big sweep of history i had in mind is something like:
    - immediately post Drankor, the world is pretty fractured and isolated, with little connection between west and east, as most trade networks would have run through the drankorian heartland. 
    - as dunmar gets established you have a green sea ->` cymea ->` south cymea ->` isingue ->` dunmar ->` chardon axis. the cymea border mountains, darkwood, orenlas, mostreve hills push trade either west (mostreve gap) or east/south (south cymea). sembara is mostly a local backwater and not really involved in international trade as such.
    - rise of avatus cuts off mostreve gap as a trade route; combined with growing wealth in tollen / sembara this pushes development of roads across ulrich. pass likely existed during drankor but was not a major trade route as there just wasn't much sembara `<->` chardon trade
    - in the aftermath of the fall of avatus the south is more dangerous - hobgoblin raids, etc - so this pushes istabor more into a north/south trade (through mostreve and south to dunmar) and reroutes a lot of long distance trade across ulrich
[2025-08-06 10:31 AM] Deciusmus: yeah that works
[2025-08-06 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus: i think there would have been a series of hobgoblin/dwarf conflicts in the lead up to great war, but ardith was very spread out compared to more northern kingdoms and plausibly couldn't realistically end hobgoblin threat, especially if hobgoblins had help from cha'mutte
[2025-08-06 11:27 AM] Deciusmus: right.
[2025-08-06 11:27 AM] Deciusmus: although for Aurbez to work post Great-War it needs to be somewhat emptied of hobgoblins
[2025-08-06 01:18 PM] Deciusmus: Just thinking about this some more and (mostly) riffing off what you have...
    
    By the early 1300s, you have a reasonably well established trade route going from the Green Sea ->` Isingue ->` Dunmar ->` Chardon and a lot of east `<->` west connections.
    
    The Great South Road from Sembara heartland ->` Cleenseau ->` Isingue exists but is relatively marginal (although the magic Drankorian road helps keep it viable). Especially because actually there isn't a ton of value in Sembara compared to Cymea and the Green Sea. Goods probably flow Isingue ->` Sembara more than anything else, as the dukes are growing in argiculture wealth and looking to import finery. I'd need to check the Green Sea history but I think 
    
    The Duchy of Brovna is mostly scattered settlements around the foothills of the Sentinels, and there is some occasional trade Sembara ->` Ulrich ->` Chardon, but it is marginal especially compared to the trade through Isingue.
    
    What the Great South Road passes through is somewhat unclear here, i.e. what is in the Maseau and Aurbez regions.
[2025-08-06 01:29 PM] Deciusmus: in 13xx (unclear the exact date, but Avatus dies in 1429) so it is probably 1370s or 80s, Avatus bursts onto the scene, drawing a lot of support from hobgoblin kingdoms in the Aurbez plateau and the upper parts of the Andonne/Doursen/etc.
    
    This fractures the human kingdoms, and reduces trade through the Mostreve Gap completely. (or at least, Avatus controls whatever trade there is).
    
    In the 1420s, Sembara defeats Avatus and founds the Duchy of Maseau in part as an explicit march/border to ensure that the human kingdoms have a connection onward to Isingue (i.e. it is in part founded as an "we dont want to let some hobgoblin kingdom come between us again" type thing)
[2025-08-06 01:30 PM] Deciusmus: The Aurbez in this time is probably dangerous - although why unclear. Remaments of hobgoblins? dragons? cha'mutte? a portal to hell?
[2025-08-06 01:32 PM] Deciusmus: In the aftermath of the Great War though, for whatever reason, I think the vibe of Aurbez should not be horrible dangers. It is a marginal land, and the ash from the plaguelands is bad, but it isn't plagued with orcs and hobgoblins and beasts that kill you. It is maybe even a little strangely quiet, a place where it is viable to have a homestead on your own and you are not going to be eaten by an ogre or a abberation or whatever
[2025-08-06 01:38 PM] rsulfuratus: right this all makes sense. it does imply that some development of south cymea would be useful becase it is likely that trade goes west from all along the coast to isingue area, but unlikely that i will have time for that before session next week (and kind of irrelevant to modern day as that is all blocked by plaguelands now). i think sufficient to say that mostreve gap was not the main trade route from east `<->` west
[2025-08-06 01:38 PM] rsulfuratus: we know that hobgoblins persisted in the aurbez area through the great war, both because of revaka and high school campaign vibes
[2025-08-06 01:39 PM] rsulfuratus: and cha'mutte was very active in this region
[2025-08-06 01:39 PM] Deciusmus: Right, so maybe the "why it is dangerous" is cha'mutte + hobgoblins
[2025-08-06 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: however, it seems likely that most/all of the hobgoblins there, and perhaps the large bulk of the "dangerous stuff" is incorproated into cha'mutte's southern army and sent to attack isingue during the great war
[2025-08-06 01:40 PM] rsulfuratus: after all cha'mutte explicitly dethroned revaka for not agreeing to join his army; seems unlikely he would have just let a new anti-cha'mutte hobgoblin take over
[2025-08-06 01:41 PM] rsulfuratus: after cha'mutte dies, a lot of the southern army hobgoblins die in the plague
[2025-08-06 01:42 PM] rsulfuratus: the vibe i think is kind of a desperate scramble with individual hobgoblin generals taking charge as best they can
[2025-08-06 01:42 PM] rsulfuratus: it might be interesting to add a new stoneborn vs hobgoblins war along the aurbez plateau in the same time frame as the iron fang attacks sembara
[2025-08-06 01:45 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2025-08-06 01:52 PM] rsulfuratus: re: Aurbez vibe - i think that it probably does have some hobgoblin raiders throughout its history, which in part drives settlement on the plateau rather than lowlands (harder to reach). but this is always fairly marginal - the western plaguelands can't support a large population of hobgoblins, who after all still need to eat, and most of the hobgoblin settlement ends up further south (until squeezed by Xurkhaz and Dunmar)
[2025-08-06 01:53 PM] Deciusmus: right that works - the farther west you go the safer. we also had some discussions at one point about tribute or other types of deals between scattered human settlers and plagueland hobgoblins to keep the scarier stuff away
[2025-08-06 01:54 PM] Deciusmus: in the Ausson's Crossing game, the foothills/plateau had a few scattered homesteads, but the inn itself (along the road, in the lowlands) was walled and had guards
[2025-08-06 02:01 PM] rsulfuratus: right, i think the idea that the big, organized parts of the Southern Army that survive the initial chaos basically make attempts to break out into better land (north to Sembara, south to Xurkhaz , southwest to Dunmar) but are all defeated. 
    
    leaving aside the eastern edge of the plaguelands / south cymea, you basically just have scattered bands that survive by raiding and no organized armies. 
    
    i do think it probably makes sense to postulate a short hobgoblin-stoneborn war to establish the mountains as "safe-ish"
[2025-08-06 02:01 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway it seems like it all works
[2025-08-06 02:02 PM] Deciusmus: yeah I like the hobgoblin-stoneborn war
[2025-08-06 02:03 PM] rsulfuratus: so we have this in the Aurbez notes:
    "Founded by two groups -- a core of refugees from the collapse of Insingue who hid out in the hills during the blood years, and developed a bit of a guerilla culture also supported the rangers a fair bit, second a group of folks who settled in Maseau or even the western marches for a bit, but were attracted by the growing rumors of an Insinguen  culture / group"
[2025-08-06 02:05 PM] rsulfuratus: and this, which i think is probably not quite correct: "After Great War this particular region was barren for a couple of years, and as the dwarves fled south in those early years the region would have been awash in chaos. Black storms of unnatural ash falling on the ground for weeks. Hobgoblin armies passing through, fleeing who knows what. Dark things emerging from the old dwarven mines. But in this time a small trickle of humans started fortifying caves up in the mountains, or building small highly fortified villages. They drifted in from the Istabor valley, for the most part, all with various tales about the terrors they fled or faced escaping and finding their way across a wasteland. Some also came in from the south, where the cataclysm of the end of the war had reshaped the very earth, raising a new set of mountains. 
    
    But for maybe a generation of humans, these refugees stayed hidden, as did you -- the land was dangerous. But as time passed, and the human kingdoms established themselves, and the plague winds shrunk to mere normal ash, the region started to grow a bit. The original refugees had children, as humans are wont to do, and the land, if not bountiful, was at least empty."
[2025-08-06 02:06 PM] rsulfuratus: then also implies the Maseau - Dunmar road was constructed by Cece, which again not sure about
[2025-08-06 02:06 PM] Deciusmus: yeah, I don't think that should be exactly right
[2025-08-06 02:08 PM] Deciusmus: the main thing that I think should be(mostly) canonical is the people + climate bits
[2025-08-06 02:08 PM] Deciusmus: not neessarily the history
[2025-08-06 02:12 PM] rsulfuratus: i would change the vibe to more like:
    - first refugees mostly live among stoneborn in the high mountains; the vibes of the first paragraph not far off
    - stoneborn/hobgoblin war makes the plateau safer, and more refugees trickle in, but this is still largely "a bit of a guerilla culture". there is no grand "refounded alliance" yet, just people ekeing out a living however they can. road likely exists though in some form, probably originally drankorian but not the 'magical high road' construction? the passes at least were in place pre-great-war and facilitated dwarven/dunmar trade. 
    - when the shatted ice clan comes over the mountains and establishes in maseau during the 2nd hobgoblin war, more refugees flee south and population swells
    - after defeat of shattered ice in 3rd hobgoblin war, trade with dunmar starts growing and here is where you get the refounded alliance and the marcher lords and that whole vibe
[2025-08-06 02:13 PM] rsulfuratus: it is not completely safe - there are hobgoblins, and strange things in the mountains, and occasional dangers on the plains.  lots of ranger and stoneborn activity. potentially has a little tiny bit of the "dunedain protecting the shire" vibe, in the sense that there is an organized effort to make it safe for homesteaders and the like to settle
[2025-08-06 02:13 PM] rsulfuratus: this gets you to 1680s
[2025-08-06 02:18 PM] rsulfuratus: the peace of cece probably sees more migration into the region as trade grows and with it opportunities. potentially the peace of cece is also a high point of the sembaran monarchy and influence, and probably drives some political debate in aurbez (especially if, e.g. Cece is funding marcher lords in the Andonne to protect the mostreve gap)
[2025-08-06 02:19 PM] rsulfuratus: then in the 1720s sembara is consumed with its own troubles, which likely drives more independence among both the marcher lords and aurbez. i could see many of the marcher lords turning to banditry of various kinds, minimally charging high tolls to make up for stipends they aren't getting from the sembaran crown, that kind of thing
[2025-08-06 02:21 PM] rsulfuratus: the post-1720 history of sembara is mostly a blank slate, excepting the rulers (Elaine II, Arryn III)
[2025-08-06 02:22 PM] Deciusmus: I like it in general. I wonder if it needs something a little more magical/Taelgarian somewhere though
[2025-08-06 02:23 PM] Deciusmus: like, why are the rangers trying to make the area safe for homesteaders?
[2025-08-06 02:25 PM] rsulfuratus: hmm, yeah. will think a bit
[2025-08-06 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: maybe they have some belief that the headwaters of the Istaros are important if they ever want to restore the magical healing waters of Isingue
[2025-08-06 02:26 PM] Deciusmus: or maybe beryl tells them to
[2025-08-06 02:26 PM] rsulfuratus: ha yeah that could work
[2025-08-06 02:27 PM] Deciusmus: I have no idea _where_ you'd take this but maybe in the aftermath of the Great War there is a bit of a fragmentation in the Rangers. A subset become almost like a cult of Beryl, and become really focused on protecting the Istaros waterways, to the extent the can.
    
    Another subset becomes more wandering defenders type folks
[2025-08-06 02:29 PM] rsulfuratus: so this might actually pre-date the Great War. there are two strands of "origin stories" for the rangers. one is as the mystical/magical guardians of the springs of isingue; the other is as guerilla fighters against avatus in the western part of addermarch
[2025-08-06 02:30 PM] rsulfuratus: so maybe one story is that the rangers were never really unified pre-great-war, exactly, and this is kind of a loose collection of people united by a few common threads. avatus in particular was a threat to isingue and addermarch
[2025-08-06 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: so the addermanian "rangers" are maybe a kind of copycat organization that doesn't have the same ties to isingue magic
[2025-08-06 02:31 PM] rsulfuratus: then beryl unites them all into "The Rangers" during the great war
[2025-08-06 02:33 PM] rsulfuratus: he dies, and the organization fractures because it was never really organized anyway. you have the "cult of beryl" , the "protectors of the isinguese / refugees", and the more generic "wandering defenders"
[2025-08-06 02:48 PM] Deciusmus: I'm mostly focused on work but I think something like that might have promise
[2025-08-06 02:52 PM] Deciusmus: Aussons mini series had a bit of a "population boom/western US settlement" vibe in the area, lots of the NPC backgrounds in Aussons were "From elsewhere" and in game that played up even more.
    
    So that fits well with 1680s trade expansion etc
