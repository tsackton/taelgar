[2023-12-28 11:58 AM] Deciusmus: Some names because I don’t like random unnamed stuff—
    For the ruined fey kingdom:
    Farsight, Clearpeak, Diamond’s Facet, Sharpspire
    
    For the beast-heavy place to the north: 
    Nature’s Sanctuary, Beasthome, Nature’s Den, Nature’s Awakening
[2023-12-28 12:18 PM] Deciusmus: Sunset Gate: a line stretching from somewhere in Amberglow to somewhere in northern Sembara. It’s a line of materialized color - yellows and reds and oranges painted in the sky, but as these physical barriers - like paint brush strokes just sitting in the air, almost. The colors are physical and passing through them is impossible, by they are riddled with cracks and openings. In some places, these cracks are sharp and dangerous, and passing through has weird time effects - sometimes it takes a day or a year to walk through a crack. In other places, especially near Twilight’s Grace, there are elaborate structures
[2023-12-28 12:19 PM] Deciusmus: Since Amberglow fell it’s been even odder and weirder and the time effects worse and less predictable. And sometimes dark clouds race along the colors, blotting them out and bringing especial danger as it’s hard to even tell where the edges are
[2023-12-28 12:24 PM] Deciusmus: Where it passes through Duskmire, near the Darkwood, Umbraeth has chiseled and chipped tried to tear it down, but it has grown back as a tangled maze of angry reds and oranges, like sharp glass. It’s especially difficult to pass and this has lead to the Darkwood, despite being the original heart of Umbraeths domain, now somewhat different
