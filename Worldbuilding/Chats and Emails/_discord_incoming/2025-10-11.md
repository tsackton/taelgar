# Discord DM – 2025-10-11

[2025-10-11 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: A few ideas for magic items…
[2025-10-11 12:50 PM] Deciusmus: Shield:
    
    in general the shield is pretty cool but a few abilities are mostly useless at this point. Some buff ideas—
    
    Make blessing of perception extent true sight to 120 (or 200) feet rather than grant see invisible 
    
    Make cloud of insects a bonus action rather than an action, and allow it to include “move up to your speed”
    
    Make the climb ability “you have the effect of the spider climb spell permanently”
    
    I’m not sure how to relate any of these back to elves though.
[2025-10-11 12:51 PM] Deciusmus: For sword:
    
    make it like moon blade from dm guide with Delwath as the first owner (so sentient and +1)
    
    Add the ability to as part of a long rest change the “enemy”’from fiends to elementals or fey or undead or celestial or aberration 
    
    Make the change part of a short rest or a 1 min ritual or an action
    
    Make the “enemy” all of the above always
[2025-10-11 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: For warlock rod:
    
    increase bonus to +2
    Add ability to use a charge to roll 2d4 and add to failed save
    Add ability to get advantage a la foresight for one action or one minute or one hour
    Add ability to pre roll a d20 and use it a la wizard divination portent of foretelling
[2025-10-11 12:53 PM] Deciusmus: The abilities would presumably be driven off charges
[2025-10-11 01:00 PM] Deciusmus: Of these I think the most fun is probably the buffs to shield and the divination portent and the sentient sword
    
    The most mechanically useful is either probably either advantage ability or the ability to shift sword to get fiend buff for other things
[2025-10-11 01:13 PM] rsulfuratus: i was thinking about something like the moonblade but worried it was too similar to beryl especially as it would make the most sense in game for it to be sentience awakened by the heartroot (so some isingue vibes)
[2025-10-11 01:14 PM] rsulfuratus: i was looking at +1 magic bonus, and also the thrown weapon property (20 normal, 60 foot long, returns automatically after an attack), as i feel like that would be fairly useful for delwath
[2025-10-11 01:14 PM] rsulfuratus: i'd flavor it as basically reach except not for opportunity attacks, so the blade would extent to strike at a distance
[2025-10-11 01:25 PM] Deciusmus: (We are heading towards honk but will read later)
[2025-10-11 06:47 PM] Deciusmus: I wouldn’t worry about similar to beryl. I like the thrown idea although I’m torn between something like that and something that would make delwaths existing abilities actually more worth using
