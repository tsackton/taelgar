[2024-01-05 11:54 AM] Deciusmus: I pushed a image that I might use as a emblem for Avatus:
    
    assets/avatus-symbol-sketch.png
[2024-01-05 11:55 AM] Deciusmus: Any concerns? This is coming up in my game via some undead warriors ressurected from battlefields of the Atavus wars
[2024-01-05 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus: looks fine to me
[2024-01-05 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus: Working more on my Dunmar page. Trying to model a bit on Wikipedia with say a short section on “politics” and then a link to a longer page as needed as I feel like it is kind of a lot to have 1000 words on Dunmari politics if you just want a quick overview
[2024-01-05 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus: “Expanded” notes for geography, religion, and history have obvious homes
[2024-01-05 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus: But eg politics, culture, economy and trade, justice/law don’t right now
[2024-01-05 12:44 PM] Deciusmus: I was thinking about the same issues for Sembara, i.e. tax law is going to be relevant in the session after next, I was going to try to pull togeher some notes but was't sure where to put it
[2024-01-05 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus: For now I’m thinking about just leaving in gazetteer
[2024-01-05 12:45 PM] Deciusmus: I was going to suggest the same
[2024-01-05 12:47 PM] Deciusmus: BTW, going back to the Highland Kingdoms name, I was going to make a obsidian change for a new tenative name...
    
    Do you prefer 
    
    Zimka (people)/Zimkovia (place) 
    Pemvos (people)/Pemvora (place)
[2024-01-05 12:48 PM] Deciusmus: Not necessarily final, but I want to start using something oher than highlands in other stuff about sembara region
[2024-01-05 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus: Although I like Zimka / Zimkovia (or Zimkova), Zovcka is probably too similar, so would probably need to change
[2024-01-05 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: Alternatively, Zovcka is the place that sees itself as "the true home" of the Zimka people
[2024-01-05 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: hence the similarity of name
[2024-01-05 12:57 PM] Deciusmus: I mean, maybe a little too confusing in actual game but I think it works from a worldbuilding perspective
[2024-01-05 01:00 PM] rsulfuratus: eh I'm not really sold, I think the names are kind of in an uncanny valley where they are close enough that you confuse them but not so close as to be obviously from the same root
[2024-01-05 01:01 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure why you couldn't just change the name of Zovcka, as far as I know it has never come up in any game
[2024-01-05 01:01 PM] Deciusmus: yeah you might be right
[2024-01-05 01:01 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, changing Zovcka is no problem
[2024-01-05 01:01 PM] Deciusmus: The term "highlander" has come up a few times in my game but I don't have any issue just changing it, it is just background color. And none of the kingdom names matter
[2024-01-05 01:02 PM] Deciusmus: honestly I'm not even sure Zovcka is a kingdom
[2024-01-05 01:02 PM] rsulfuratus: highlander is just what the sembarans call the Zimka
[2024-01-05 01:02 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-01-05 01:02 PM] Deciusmus: But it came up because one of the players speaks Zimka, but again, no issue just telling him I renamed the languag
[2024-01-05 01:06 PM] Deciusmus: Honestly I might just erase Zovcka for now
[2024-01-05 01:06 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2024-01-05 01:06 PM] Deciusmus: why does there have to be a specific name for the Zimka people north of Breva that were never controlled by Sembara?
[2024-01-05 01:06 PM] Deciusmus: (rhetorical question)
[2024-01-05 01:07 PM] Deciusmus: Actually the more I think about that I like it because naming it as a "kingdom" kinda guides the mind in a certain direction, and I'm not sure the Zimka really have the same concept of kingship as the sembaras
[2024-01-05 01:30 PM] Deciusmus: I’m working a bit on land tenure in Sembara, and based on our previous conversation, rethinking a bit about how it grew outside the original six duchies.
[2024-01-05 01:31 PM] Deciusmus: The original timeline I wrote imagined a series of conquests but that doesn’t really feel right
[2024-01-05 01:33 PM] Deciusmus: Who was living in these places after the fall of Drankor? I’m not really sure.
[2024-01-05 01:33 PM] Deciusmus: That said the Great War depopulated a lot of it so maybe it doesn’t matter
[2024-01-05 01:33 PM] rsulfuratus: I don't think I'd bother to write much of that old history
[2024-01-05 01:33 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah that was the conclusion I was coming to
[2024-01-05 01:35 PM] rsulfuratus: one thing that is obvious after revisiting my old dunmar notes is that while I had some good bones of things, there is a lot in the old google docs that turned out to be wrong after playing a game in dunmar for 3 years, and it is a lot easier now to write up a good dunmar page. 
    
    so I'm kind of inclined to be a little careful over-inventing stuff - or at least committing to stuff as canon - too early
[2024-01-05 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: pushed a complete draft of my rewritten Dunmar note, curious if you have any feedback, especially on organization
[2024-01-05 02:23 PM] rsulfuratus: subnotes are not generally done, or are just notes
[2024-01-05 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: I'm looking at dunmar
[2024-01-05 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: I pushed a note on land holding in sembara that I'd appreciate thoughts on
[2024-01-05 03:17 PM] Deciusmus: largely based on medieval england and the complexity of French/Normal law vs Anglo-Saxon law
[2024-01-05 03:27 PM] Deciusmus: I like the organization a lot
[2024-01-05 03:31 PM] rsulfuratus: on sembaran land ownership - I think the vibe feels right in general. specific comments mostly on non-humans
[2024-01-05 03:32 PM] Deciusmus: One comment on Dunmar, btw: what are the borders, exactly? Is there some set of land that is considered "dunmar" by the gods?
[2024-01-05 03:33 PM] rsulfuratus: my feeling is probably not
[2024-01-05 03:33 PM] rsulfuratus: the "the gods own the land" is more of a cultural/religious aspect of dunmari culture than the gods actually owning the land
[2024-01-05 03:34 PM] rsulfuratus: although i do have a bunch of old, dubiously canonical notes about the gods specifically bringing the dunmari to this place for a particular purpose
[2024-01-05 03:35 PM] rsulfuratus: or perhaps it goes the other way, the longer the dunmari occupy a place, the more the gods grow to inhabit it
[2024-01-05 03:35 PM] Deciusmus: I like the vibe of the dunmari being more a people than a place, per se.
[2024-01-05 03:36 PM] Deciusmus: That is, Dunmar doesn't really have formal borders or political organization, it is the membership in a temple and the relationship of the temple to the Samraat that matters, not where you live
[2024-01-05 03:36 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, I think that is definitely true
[2024-01-05 03:36 PM] Deciusmus: So I think the political organization in the note could clarify that a bit more
[2024-01-05 03:37 PM] rsulfuratus: I also kind of like the idea that the reason it is Shakun - after all, a rather minor diety - is responsible for the defense of the eastern border from all kinds of bad things is specifically because unlike the five siblings, she was born to a Dunmari and had a physical connection to the land
[2024-01-05 03:39 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway on land holdings:
[2024-01-05 03:40 PM] rsulfuratus: 1. dwarves I think would certainly own land, but probably never not outright (and even taxes might be complicated). dwarves would very likely outlive the lord of the manor, and there could theoretically be dwarven communities that have passed down land for longer than Sembara has existed
[2024-01-05 03:41 PM] rsulfuratus: not sure exactly how this would play out and it probably isn't formalized in the way that relationships with lizardfolk and halflings are
[2024-01-05 03:42 PM] rsulfuratus: but it doesn't seem very dwarvish for a dwarf to consider themselves a "peasant"
[2024-01-05 03:42 PM] Deciusmus: I think maybe that's just a poor choice of words in my doc
[2024-01-05 03:43 PM] Deciusmus: I don't think freehold land is particularly "subserviant"
[2024-01-05 03:43 PM] rsulfuratus: well yes, even putting aside the subserviant aspect
[2024-01-05 03:44 PM] Deciusmus: I dunno, if the dwarf buys Sembaran land, why would they be against paying taxes onit?
[2024-01-05 03:45 PM] Deciusmus: Or why wouldn't a dwarven smith by willing to lease some land from a lord, or whoever, because they didn't intended to stay for more than 30-50 years, so a 50 year lease seemed better than outright buying the land?
[2024-01-05 03:45 PM] rsulfuratus: I don't think they would be against paying taxes on it - or even, necessarily, leasing it. i'm thinking about the opposite arrangement though, where the dwarves are already there and perhaps have been there for a while, and the land is now claimed as crownland or whatever
[2024-01-05 03:46 PM] Deciusmus: RIght, in those cases I just think the land would have never been claimed as crownland
[2024-01-05 03:46 PM] Deciusmus: Its folkland
[2024-01-05 03:46 PM] rsulfuratus: ah, sure, okay, that makes sense
[2024-01-05 03:46 PM] Deciusmus: I actually envision the legal arrangements in some places as being quite complex
[2024-01-05 03:47 PM] rsulfuratus: so you might have little bits of folkland on a manorial estate that was in some dwarven family since before barony of X even exists
[2024-01-05 03:47 PM] rsulfuratus: that makes sense
[2024-01-05 03:47 PM] Deciusmus: Yeah, exactly
[2024-01-05 03:47 PM] Deciusmus: Now, the dwarves might sell it, in which case it becomes crownland
[2024-01-05 03:47 PM] Deciusmus: You can't really sell folkland outside of your "folk"
[2024-01-05 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: so in this case, to non-dwarves
[2024-01-05 03:48 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-01-05 03:48 PM] Deciusmus: By the dwarves could sublease it, or whatever
[2024-01-05 03:49 PM] rsulfuratus: anyway, I think that works. dwarves are basically fine with debts and obligations and would generalyl fit in the system, although I think could be a lot of odd quirks (e.g. a dwarf might offer a very large sum instead of annual taxes in order to turn a piece of crownland back into folkland, for some  reason)
[2024-01-05 03:50 PM] Deciusmus: Sure, that's basically the same idea as the lizardfolk. You are negoiating with the duke or king or queen
[2024-01-05 03:52 PM] rsulfuratus: I think the only think I would change about lizardfolk is that there is probably room for a range of attitudes here
[2024-01-05 03:52 PM] rsulfuratus: all lizardfolk consider their land folkland
[2024-01-05 03:52 PM] rsulfuratus: but some lizardfolk might consider much of lowland sembara as "lizardfolk land"
[2024-01-05 03:52 PM] rsulfuratus: since historically (long ago) it was
[2024-01-05 03:53 PM] rsulfuratus: so there may be times when lizardfolk just settle without asking for permission and dare the local lord to do something about it
[2024-01-05 03:53 PM] rsulfuratus: this doesn't have to be common but I don't think relationships between sembarans and lizardfolk need to be 100% peaceful all the time
[2024-01-05 03:54 PM] Deciusmus: true. I'm just not sure I want to set up Sembara in the role of colonizer taking the indigenous land
[2024-01-05 03:55 PM] rsulfuratus: fair, although it is pretty different since the humans were there long ago too, and the lizardfolk weren't driven out by the humans
[2024-01-05 03:56 PM] Deciusmus: Right, just if it comes up in an actual game I'd want it to be more differentiated and less coded as "hey this was our land, we are taking it back"
[2024-01-05 03:57 PM] rsulfuratus: I wouldn't play it as that. I don't think the lizardfolk would view sembaran settlements as occupying stolen land - it is more a question of rents on profits
[2024-01-05 03:57 PM] rsulfuratus: and whether it is formally sensible to lay claim to unsettled, unimproved land
[2024-01-05 03:58 PM] rsulfuratus: perhaps (some) lizardfolk understand unimproved, unsettled land as simply empty and free to be claimed by anyone willing to work it
[2024-01-05 03:58 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-01-05 03:58 PM] rsulfuratus: the sembarans who settled and built cities are doing exactly what they should - settle and grow and the land is yours
[2024-01-05 03:59 PM] rsulfuratus: it is only the idea of a lord saying "this land is mine by right of whatever" *without* settling it or working it
[2024-01-05 03:59 PM] Deciusmus: Right, in fact, the ancient idea of folkland matches that exactly and could even have come (at least in part) from the lizardfolk
[2024-01-05 03:59 PM] rsulfuratus: of course going back to earlier conversations about lizardfolk they might have very different ideas of what improving land means
[2024-01-05 04:00 PM] rsulfuratus: but I think the vibe is still right regardless of details - the basic idea is the land supports you and you support it, and that is what gives you property rights
[2024-01-05 04:00 PM] rsulfuratus: not the fact that you marched an army through two years ago
[2024-01-05 04:00 PM] Deciusmus: (Some) lizardfolk then just reject all the "overlord/sovereign" stuff
[2024-01-05 04:01 PM] Deciusmus: perhaps other lizardfolk see the building walls and maintaining borders as "improving" the land in a way that gives the crown control
[2024-01-05 04:01 PM] rsulfuratus: sure
[2024-01-05 04:02 PM] Deciusmus: It could just play almost as a disagreement about scope. Is maintaining a road through a wilderness an improvement to all of that empty land?
[2024-01-05 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, exactly
[2024-01-05 04:02 PM] rsulfuratus: and I think it is more interesting if there are a range of opinions and disagreements among the lizardfolk
[2024-01-05 04:03 PM] rsulfuratus: now, halflings are more complicated
[2024-01-05 04:04 PM] Deciusmus: Ultimately almost all of the "new" crownland outside of the ancient duchies either came about via 
    * a slow process of accretion as (human) families died out, or sold land, and various tracts and bits and pieces came under the control of the crown
    * major depopulation events were reversed by armies, and the crown claimed all the land they freed from the hobgoblins/whatever
[2024-01-05 04:04 PM] rsulfuratus: I really don't think halflings would give a hoot about some human lord. if a halfling family wants to settle down and run an inn on the road between fellburn and rinburg, they aren't going to negotiate with some lord
[2024-01-05 04:05 PM] rsulfuratus: they are going to build an inn, and run it. or negotiate with someone who owns an inn, and take it over
[2024-01-05 04:05 PM] rsulfuratus: the whole concept that someone can "own" land feels very un-halfling
[2024-01-05 04:05 PM] rsulfuratus: that said, they probably feel fine about paying taxes
[2024-01-05 04:06 PM] rsulfuratus: but also probably have their own opinions about what taxes are fair
[2024-01-05 04:06 PM] Deciusmus: Do you envision halflings as just kinda like ignoring local law?
[2024-01-05 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, almost completely
[2024-01-05 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: Presumably they aren't going to just decide this piece of farmland looks nice so I'm just going to take it over
[2024-01-05 04:07 PM] Deciusmus: It seems hard to be a member of society in a fixed location and ignore the laws
[2024-01-05 04:07 PM] rsulfuratus: well, they have their own laws
[2024-01-05 04:08 PM] rsulfuratus: so for example you can't just take stuff would be enforced at the halfling end of things not the human end of things, so to speak
[2024-01-05 04:08 PM] Deciusmus: Why would humans put up with that though?
[2024-01-05 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: I guess if it works and doesn't really cause problems
[2024-01-05 04:09 PM] rsulfuratus: well usually halflings are pretty well behaved, and they are quick to punish their own troublemakers
[2024-01-05 04:09 PM] Deciusmus: But why would the human lords of the land tolerate a halfling effectively just stealing their land?
[2024-01-05 04:10 PM] Deciusmus: I guess I don't really imagine halflings wanted to build a home in the middle of nowhere
[2024-01-05 04:10 PM] rsulfuratus: people tolerate it because it doesn't always end up as "stealing"
[2024-01-05 04:10 PM] Deciusmus: If you are building an inn just outside the walls of Rinburg, what, they just do it even though someone owns that land?
[2024-01-05 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: no, that is the "you can't just take land"
[2024-01-05 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: I think I'd imagine it like this. say a halfling family wants to start an inn outside Rinburg
[2024-01-05 04:11 PM] rsulfuratus: there is a nice orchard near the river, just along the road, that seems perfect.
[2024-01-05 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: the set up camp in the orchard, and let it be known that they want to stay
[2024-01-05 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: and then they wait
[2024-01-05 04:12 PM] rsulfuratus: probably they don't build anything for a year, but they have a little market
[2024-01-05 04:13 PM] rsulfuratus: presumably at some point -- relatively soon, unless it is owned by an absentee landlord or something -- whoever owns the orchard (if they aren't the person working it every day) shows up
[2024-01-05 04:13 PM] rsulfuratus: the halflings ask if they can build an inn, and what the person wants
[2024-01-05 04:14 PM] rsulfuratus: if they can't come to an agreement, they move on. maybe they come back in a generation and see if the new owners are more amenable
[2024-01-05 04:14 PM] rsulfuratus: but most people agree pretty quickly, because the halflings remember strange things. you don't want your kids cursing you out for refusing a good offer
[2024-01-05 04:14 PM] rsulfuratus: and sometimes what the halflings offer is way more than what the land is worth
[2024-01-05 04:14 PM] Deciusmus: Right, but isn't that in fact "negoitating with some lord"?
[2024-01-05 04:15 PM] rsulfuratus: i guess I was more thinking about chains of obligations
[2024-01-05 04:15 PM] Deciusmus: But land really doesn't have a chain of obligations
[2024-01-05 04:16 PM] rsulfuratus: well, you owe tax to someone
[2024-01-05 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: Sure, but most taxes are only on argicultural produce
[2024-01-05 04:16 PM] Deciusmus: An inn doesn't owe property tax
[2024-01-05 04:17 PM] rsulfuratus: and halflings, for example, might not always agree on who owns land. if you are a peasant who has a 50 year lease, the halfings might decide you own the land, not the lord
[2024-01-05 04:17 PM] Deciusmus: Right, but it gets dicey for the person with the 50 year lease
[2024-01-05 04:18 PM] rsulfuratus: sure. although there are probably plenty of stories (true or false) of halflings who gave some peasant a comparatively huge some of money for land they didn't technically own, and then the peasant just skipped town
[2024-01-05 04:18 PM] rsulfuratus: and left the halflings to deal with the lord
[2024-01-05 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: Right, and the retribution would fall on the peasant not the haflings ,ultimately, because the lord doesn't want to piss off the halflings
[2024-01-05 04:19 PM] rsulfuratus: that is why they skip town
[2024-01-05 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-01-05 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: But sometimes they are caught anyway
[2024-01-05 04:19 PM] rsulfuratus: of course. basically the idea is the haflings don't really interact with the formal system of land registeries and deeds
[2024-01-05 04:19 PM] Deciusmus: And othertimes the halflings are forced to leave, although that probably doesn't end well for the lord
[2024-01-05 04:20 PM] Deciusmus: Although I don't have a good sense of halflings view of collective punishment
[2024-01-05 04:21 PM] rsulfuratus: at one point schwartz and discussed this and were leaning towards the idea that halflings have a very strong sense of familial justice - so if your great great grandparent cheated their great great grandparent you are in trouble
[2024-01-05 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: Right I more meant if a lord pushes the halflings out, do they punish everyone who lives in the manor?
[2024-01-05 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: Or just the lords family
[2024-01-05 04:21 PM] rsulfuratus: no, just the lords family
[2024-01-05 04:21 PM] Deciusmus: But they might not always have a good mechanism to do that
[2024-01-05 04:22 PM] rsulfuratus: right, which is why sometimes the halflings get pushed out
[2024-01-05 04:22 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-01-05 04:22 PM] Deciusmus: Also, it doesn't strike me as obvious that the halfling would decide that the yearly lease-fee is meaningless, i.e. would they actually want to ruin some small scale landholder?
[2024-01-05 04:22 PM] Deciusmus: I guess maybe sometimes they do
[2024-01-05 04:22 PM] Deciusmus: and other times they don't
[2024-01-05 04:23 PM] rsulfuratus: halflings are supposed to feel kind of chaotic
[2024-01-05 04:24 PM] rsulfuratus: sometimes they. might double the yearly lease fee the previous owner was paying for no clear reason apparent to the landholder
[2024-01-05 04:24 PM] Deciusmus: What is a halfling view on contracts?
[2024-01-05 04:25 PM] rsulfuratus: I think their view is roughly something like my present self cannot compel an obligation from my future self to your future self\
[2024-01-05 04:26 PM] rsulfuratus: of course this can't be taken to the extreme or you couldn't even buy something from them
[2024-01-05 04:26 PM] rsulfuratus: but I think generally most people would be wary of long term contracts with halflings
[2024-01-05 04:26 PM] rsulfuratus: e.g. you'd never make a 50 year lease with a halfling imagining it would be kept
[2024-01-05 04:26 PM] rsulfuratus: you'd make a series of 1 year leases
[2024-01-05 04:26 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-01-05 04:28 PM] Deciusmus: But I think from the perspective of Sembaran land holding, it boils down to 
    (a) a halfling would consider the land theirs as long as they had purchased it fairly and they were still using it
    (b) halflings don't always agree with the Sembaran legal system as to who the owner is or what theterms of purchase "should be"
[2024-01-05 04:30 PM] rsulfuratus: right, and if they acquire a freehold, and would normally owe a manorial tax, they might also not agree with the lord on what the manorial tax should be - they would view this as a negotiation where the amount owed might include 0, instead of something the lord gets to decide
[2024-01-05 04:30 PM] Deciusmus: Well...
[2024-01-05 04:31 PM] Deciusmus: I haven't refactored the taxes part, but I think for the most part the manorial taxes are a percetage of the harvest
[2024-01-05 04:31 PM] Deciusmus: If you build an inn, nothing is due
[2024-01-05 04:31 PM] rsulfuratus: but then doesn't the growth of a city just cost money? unless the lord is getting it back in other taxes
[2024-01-05 04:32 PM] Deciusmus: I have a separate taxes document that basically has 3 main taxes:
    
    the deca and nonem, which are 1/10 and 1/9 of the harvest (so collectively, 19% of the harvest), due on argicultural produce
    the hearth tax, due from every building with a hearth
[2024-01-05 04:32 PM] rsulfuratus: okay, sure, then halflings might pay the hearth tax but consider it a negiotiation to set a fair rate
[2024-01-05 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: Then, additionally, there is a baronial tax, owed by the baron to the crown or duke, for which the baron has to collect money
[2024-01-05 04:33 PM] Deciusmus: Often via market taxes, taxes on inns, poll taxes (i.e. tax per person), bridge/road taxes, etc
[2024-01-05 04:33 PM] rsulfuratus: right, sure
[2024-01-05 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: But I kinda assume halflings would generally pay these, if they saw them as fair taxes for the stuff they are gettig (.e. use of a road)
[2024-01-05 04:34 PM] rsulfuratus: so this is a bit separate from landowning per se but the general view of halflings would not be "we don't pay those taxes" it would be "we offer you what is fair and negotiate"
[2024-01-05 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: And it probably comes out in the wash, i.e. the one time the baron gets stiffed, but some other time a halfling caravan pays 10x as much
[2024-01-05 04:34 PM] rsulfuratus: yes, exactly
[2024-01-05 04:34 PM] Deciusmus: So mostly who is going to complain
[2024-01-05 04:35 PM] rsulfuratus: I think that people should see halflings a bit like a lottery ticket but with fair odds
[2024-01-05 04:35 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-01-05 04:35 PM] rsulfuratus: and then human pyschology takes over and the stories of winning circulate in a way that the stories of losing don't
[2024-01-05 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: Right the other bit is mandatory gifts, i.e. the lord of manor might expect gifts from everyone on the birth of the heir
[2024-01-05 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: but of course, this would also apply might more gently to halflings
[2024-01-05 04:36 PM] rsulfuratus: the idea of a mandatory gift would probably be seen as quite offensive by halflings
[2024-01-05 04:36 PM] Deciusmus: No one "demands" the halflings pay the gift, the lord lets it be known this has happened, and hopes for the best
[2024-01-05 04:37 PM] rsulfuratus: right
[2024-01-05 04:37 PM] Deciusmus: Right but the idea of giving the lord a present on the birth of the heir, if the lord has been a huge boon to the local halfling community would not be weird at all
[2024-01-05 04:37 PM] Deciusmus: And might also be quite substantial
[2024-01-05 04:37 PM] rsulfuratus: no, of course not, it could be vastly more than what you would expect
[2024-01-05 04:38 PM] rsulfuratus: this all plays into the lottery idea. if you keep the hallings that pass through your land happy and safe, then when your heir is born maybe you'll get something truly huge
[2024-01-05 04:38 PM] Deciusmus: right
[2024-01-05 04:39 PM] Deciusmus: The only other source of money I have that would be very offensive to halflings is the idea of local monopolies
[2024-01-05 04:39 PM] rsulfuratus: and the story about how the lord of such-place's son got a dozen horses for a wedding gift from some halflings he'd never even met before travels far and wide (probably in part helped by halflings themselves)
[2024-01-05 04:40 PM] rsulfuratus: yeah halflings would just basically ignore those
[2024-01-05 04:41 PM] Deciusmus: Probably one of the few things that would cause true conflict; if some lord's main source of incoming is the local monopoly on brewing, and a hafling decides to open a brewery/inn in the same town, the lord might not really have any good options
[2024-01-05 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: but of course the halflings would know this, and although they should feel chaotic it isn't totally capricious
[2024-01-05 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: But I suspect that is quite rare, as these types of monopolies are usually on stuff like milling, brewing, bakehouses, etc not say "selling glassware"
[2024-01-05 04:42 PM] Deciusmus: Right. But that's how they punish the grandson of the lord who didn't let them build an inn without punishing the whole town
[2024-01-05 04:42 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
[2024-01-05 04:43 PM] Deciusmus: So to the poor grandson, maybe it really does seem capricious because he doesn't know that his grandfather refused a halfling deal
[2024-01-05 04:43 PM] Deciusmus: But that all works well, I think
[2024-01-05 04:43 PM] rsulfuratus: it is caprcious to the humans but not the halflings
[2024-01-05 04:43 PM] Deciusmus: Right
[2024-01-05 04:44 PM] Deciusmus: I think dwarves and local monopolies is more interesting; what I have in my notes is that the dwarves are given permission to ignore the local monopoly as long as they don't sell to humans. To me, that seems reasonable, but not sure your thoughts
[2024-01-05 04:45 PM] rsulfuratus: i think dwarves are the most likely of any non-human race to have substantial "dwarven quarters" in human cities and towns
[2024-01-05 04:45 PM] rsulfuratus: so that does have a certain logic
[2024-01-05 04:46 PM] rsulfuratus: i think depending on the size of the local dwarven community you'd have a variety of arrangements, but that feels like a plausible option
[2024-01-05 04:46 PM] Deciusmus: Right. It isn't one size fits all on the Sembaran side either, a lot depends on the specific baron and duchy and lord
[2024-01-05 04:47 PM] rsulfuratus: i also think it is worth keeping in mind a little rare species like elves, centaurs, stoneborn, various fey, etc. they are rare enough that this is mostly going to be kind of one-off arrangements
[2024-01-05 04:48 PM] rsulfuratus: which would mostly exist outside of typical human rules and understanding
[2024-01-05 04:49 PM] Deciusmus: Right, I think there are no "general rules" outside of lizardfolk/halflings/dwarves.
[2024-01-05 04:49 PM] Deciusmus: And even for halflings there are probably no laws, more folklore and word of mouth about how to best deal with them
[2024-01-05 04:50 PM] rsulfuratus: yes
