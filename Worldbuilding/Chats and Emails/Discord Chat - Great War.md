looking at your Cleenseau doc - making me think I probably need to try to sketch out a definitive history of the Great War based on what I can remember / find of actual campaign history from the 90s, plus some retcons inventions as needed. a key question is did the hobgoblin army that sacked insigue (nee irebor) reach sembara, and if so how deep did they penetrate?

My dim recollection from high school was that Sembara was a "base of operations" that never was heavily invaded

yeah that was my thinking as well - I seem to recall a race basically to kill cha'mutte before he could ~do something mysterious~ to knock out the sembaran army

there was a war council and i have a bunch of notes somewhere with troop strengths basically for the southern sembaran army

The main thrust was in the north, according to that

right, that is why you and cha'mutte were in urlich in the first place


[11/4/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
i think looking back at what notes I can easily the intetion was that cha'mutte created the plague to cut dunmar off from sembara, but then on his death is spread somewhat and destroyed the hobgoblin army that had sacked isingue and was threatened sembara's southern borders.

there was also a whole thing about the lich king of Vasa (now Vostok) that seems like it should just mostly be tossed
