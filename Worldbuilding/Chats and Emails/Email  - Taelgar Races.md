Elves/Goliath/Lizardfolk/Dwarves/Halfings are the Elder races, those that were created by Eru/Aru/Arat (whatever new name we are using) / Melikor and have racial ancestors that embody their archetypes (e.g. Firstborn) although these are called different things by each race. All of these races have strong racial magic. I've tried to capture the flavor with their racial abilities, but powerful racial-magic-users would probably have to come through racial feats and/or reskinning magic-wielding classes for the desired effect. 

  

Gnomes are more of less evolved from Dwarves and are sundered from the Dwarven Firstborn. They now live in the desert.

  

Humans are humans.

  

Kenku were created in Aerin's image when you all went back to before time, which means they sort of have a firstborn (Aerin) but are not really one of the Elder races. They are most challenging as the base Kenku package is super powerful if you include flight and their shapeshifting / hiding consciousness abilities. Racial feats and DM discretion for powerful, high-level characters could work here I guess.

  

Leonins are what we called Liontaurs in our college emails -- we liked the idea but they never got developed. They are a reskinned cat race from Volo's guide to monsters. I like the concept and it seems nice to have a few exotic races, although perhaps there is no real need to include them.

  

Things that I considered but didn't include -- some of these seem reasonable but it isn't clear if there is really a reason to develop them or include them in Taelgar right away.

Shaku (half-human, half-hobgolbin -- while there is no reason for most races to be able to interbreed, humans and hobgoblins plausibly could be interfertile based on Taelgar mythology): would be just a reskinned half-orc with different lore. Seems challenging to include in a semi-realistic campaign for kids because realistically most of these would be children of rape/conquest and that doesn't seem so fun, but could go the Player's Handbook route and just ignore realism. 

  

Some kind of faery/fey born Tielfing variant, i.e. a human with some kind of magical ancestry, seems like there is an almost infinite variety of choices here based on Tielfing formula (darkvision, resistance to something, and cantrip/L1/L2 spell progression), but hard to see exactly what the need is to add something like that. 

  

I also thought about subraces for halflings (seaborn and landborn or something like that) but decided it seemed unnecessary; not really obvious that there are distinct halfling subraces in Taelgar. Same for goliath and lizardfolk and kenku, although I could certainly imagine different lizardfolk variants. At one point I was considering a goliath variant that lived somewhere else (probably high arctic, like snow goliaths or something), which I still think is a cool idea but maybe not worth the effort to invent and not clear they would have different racial traits as opposed to just different background / lore. 

  

Of course there are can be all sorts of variants in distant lands that don't have to exist now. My focus was on 1) recreating the key races from our campaign, and 2) starting to develop the new races we added in our post-campaign world building discussions.

  

Would be very curious about your thoughts, especially on rules and but also on lore.

  

Next up I will probably tackle tweaking the map a bit (the death of Cha'mutte was pretty cataclysmic and could change things), very roughly sketching out some human cultures, and picking a small area to develop in more detail as the setting for a possible set of episodic adventures with Isaac & friends and anyone else who would play (Isaac is working on Kate, we'd have a pretty good group if Dana got back into it)
