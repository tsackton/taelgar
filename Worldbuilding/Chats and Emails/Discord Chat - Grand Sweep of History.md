so the general grand sweep of things is that cha'mutte had these huge armies in the north, and when he dies all the magic that sustains their logistics falls apart, and so a great host (led by a dragon conclave, and consisting of hobgoblins, trolls, giants, etc) sweeps south from Pandar. this is what destroys most of the pre-Great War polities in the west, and forges Chardon into an empire. the advance is stopped outside of Chardon in the 1550s (so maybe a ~7 year war), and then there is probably two decades of reconquest and resettlement as Chardonian forces move north; perhaps this goes in a few pulses, with some gaps, the timeline is not exactly clear (except that the current northernmost border city, Voltara is only about ~50 years old, so must have been founded around 1700).


[1/5/2023 11:10 AM] rsulfuratus
the original idea was that the remnant hobgoblins who survive Chardon flee into the mountains, east and south, and emerge as threats to sembara in the 1580s-1590s, and Dunmar in the 1600-1610, with both countries largely peaceful by the 1620s


[1/5/2023 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
but this is not canon anywhere - I can't change the Dunmar timeline but the Sembara timeline is not introduced in play anywhere (except as a retconned date for the stone titan one shot in Dunmore, but that could happen at any time and was self-contained that shifting the date around doesn't matter)


[1/5/2023 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus
so you could easily have: Chardon defeats dragon conclave, hobgoblins scatter; some regroup in the northern parts of Dunmar and there is a war there in the 1600s, but hobgoblins are defeated and scatter again. in the 1640s or whenever, a new hobgoblin leader arises who starts to attract recruits and settlers, and a new threat grows


[1/5/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
the only other thing is the history beats that outline the dissolution of greater sembara into the various modern day pieces work well now. so that means either stretching out the chaos in sembara for an extra 50 years (meaning the "blood years" run roughly from 1545-1565 in the west, 1545-1610 in Dunmar, and 1545-1660 in Sembara), or inserting another peaceful interlude in the middle that is disrupted again by the new hobgoblin frontier (which means the fortifications of the marches would have probably happened prior to Cece, but there would still be the scars of the second war)


[1/5/2023 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
What about something like the following...

1550s: Hobgoblins stopped near Chardon
1580s: Hobgoblins pushed over the mountains towards Sembara; hobgoblin war in Sembara
1580s-1600: Hobgoblins driven back by a series of weak rulers, but not crushed. 
1600s-1610: Hobgoblins move towards Dunmar and defeated badly in Dunmar
1610s - 1640s: Chardon and Dunmar peaceful. A stalemate of sorts in Sembara some significant reserves of hobgoblins both in the southern mountains (around where the March of Andonne is now) and the eastern edges of the Crimson Forest and the elderwood
1650ish: a new leader arises amongst these hobgoblins and sweeps into Sembara from the west and south, devasting the areas in the southwest
1650s: Cece comes to the throne, a young queen of just barely 20, facing this hobgoblin onslaught, and gains a reptuation as Derik III reborn by basically winning a series of decisive victories, heralding effectively a century of peace in Sembara


[1/5/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think the basic outline works. the exact details of where hobgoblins are in between wars probably doesn't matter for the moment. but the new leader arising among the hobgoblins turning what is basically a long-term frozen conflict with little actual fighting into a serious war works well


[1/5/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
you could have sort of a vikings in england from 850-1000 kind of vibe




[10/29/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
what do you think of the following short narrative of hobgoblins

After the death of Cha'mutte there were two major hobgoblin hordes: one in the north and one in the south.

The southern horde was more badly damaged from the Great War itself, the plagues, and other activities, and rapidly split into two major clans: The Bitter Knife clan, who fought a thirty year war with the Dunmari before being defeated, and the Iron Fang clan, who pushed north and were mostly defeated by Sembara, but also settled on the edges of the Plaguelands.

The northern horde mostly pushed south to Chardon, but a smaller part (the Shattered Ice clan) regrouped and then attempted over the 1550s and 1560s to cross the Sentinal Range into Sembara. These were mostly pushed back by the dwarves and highland kingdoms in the 1550s and early 1560s.

In the 1570s, however, this remanent regroups, perhaps with some hobgoblins being pushed east by Chardon, and attacks in alliance with mind-flayers in the west of Sembara. This is the First Hobgoblin War. It ends somewhat inconclusively, with the mind-flayers kept out of main Sembaran terrority but the hobgoblins clearly still a threat.

In the 1580s, they burst west again, overwhelming the Sembaran defenses and establishing the Dominion of <Something>

By 1600, the remanents of the Chardonian hordes were regrouping in the southern Sentinel Range, under the banner of the Blackened Claw. The (much larger) remenants of the Shattered Ice clan had established dominion over a broad swath of land from the Sentinel Range along the headwaters of the Enst and as far east as the edge of the Mostreve Hills on the borders of Addermarch.


[10/29/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
Between 1603 and 1610 the Dunmari pushed the Blackened Claw north and east, and by 1610, the situation is:

* The land between the Sentinel Range and the Istaros, south of the Masance and the Andonne Rivers is a no-man's land, and scattered bands of hobgoblins mostly from the defeated Blackened Claw and Iron Fang clans roam here, but there are no large established kingdoms
* The  Dominion of <Something> rules from the height of the eastern borders of the Elderwood, across the Sentinel Range, and across the headwaters of the Enst as far as the western Mostreve Hills on the borders of Adderfell
* The Duchy of Maseau is surrounded by hobgoblins and largely cut off from Sembara in the north

For a generation, from 1610 - 1647, an uneasy peace lasts in the region between Sembara and the Dominion of Ice. Sembara pays tribute at times, and the Rangers and others in Maseau wage a endless war of destabilization, trying to keep the hobgoblins disorganized. Leadership within the hobgoblin kingdom is weak. This is also a period when Maseau expands southward. The Great South Road connecting to Tokra is built at this time.

In 1647, the year before Cece comes to the throne, the fourth hobgoblin war errupts as new leadership within the Dominion of Ice turns to conquest pushing up the Enst as far as Fellburn before being turned back by Cece, newly raised to the throne.

In a series of campaigns over several years, Cece rapidly pushes the hobgoblins back, and by 1652 no hobgoblins remain west of Enford. The wall between Dunmore and Enford is built at this time.


[10/29/2023 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
Im not sure I’m happy with the length of time where the hobgoblins are around between 1590 and 1648 though, seems like too long to have parts of western sembara ruled by a hobgoblin kingdom


[10/29/2023 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't given much thought to hobgoblins around Sembara after the Great War. a few key facts though, specifically about the west and the south where I have given this more thought


[10/29/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
first, to set the stage, Cha'mutte commanded the loyalty of almost all significant hobgoblin groups in the lead up to the great war, and during the great war. as part of this, he protected large numbers of hobgoblins in the north around pandar, sustaining them magically. there were other hobgoblins around, presumably - some on the northern border of dunmar, some to the east, etc


[10/29/2023 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
when Cha'mutte is killed, the very large hobgoblin kingdom/civilization living in pandar is left without enough food to survive, and begins to march south, conquering as they go.


[10/29/2023 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
they split into two armies, more or less. the eastern army is led by a conclave of dragons, and conquers through the kingdoms of the elves and denoqai. defeated outside chardon in 1556, largely leaving behind devasted lands


[10/29/2023 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
(As an aside, what I’m really trying to do is have Cleenseau have been a significant military post in the 1580s that was overrun at some point and abandoned and then refounded in the early 1650s)


[10/29/2023 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
the western army is more deliberate moving through human lands, establishing a series of hobgoblin kingdoms, perhaps under the overlordship of a high king or something (details not super relevant) through the 1550s. defeated by chardon as well (in my notes have this actually in 1551, but probably would realistically be a decade or more later)


[10/29/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but this is just a retreat, not a full defeat, since there are hobgoblin kingdoms to retreat to.


[10/29/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
over the next 50 years or something, chardon slowly marches north, freeing the surviving human populations from hobgoblin rule


[10/29/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't worked out the details


[10/29/2023 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
(except in context of mawar, where the mawar renaissance was in the early 1600s, so hobgoblin threat must be largely gone by then, but chardon dominance not yet fully established)


[10/29/2023 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, postulating a serious split in cha'mutte's armies between these eastern and western branches, the timing would work for the survivors of eastern army to flee over the mountains in the 1570s-1580s


[10/29/2023 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
this all works with your shattered ice clan and then a war in the 1580s on the western frontier of sembara


[10/29/2023 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Although my earlier history has a series of@hobgoblin attacks in the late 1550s that are ignored by the crown and lead to the independence of the highland kingdoms. But that isn’t introduced in game anywhere maybe it should be something other than hobgoblins


[10/29/2023 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
lots of things that could be


[10/29/2023 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
Probably making it not hobgoblins is more interesting actually


[10/29/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
So the first serious incursion of hobgoblins to Sembara in the 1570s under Wissym (which is actually hobgoblins commanded by mindflayers ala the original@one shot)


[10/29/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[10/29/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so then in the south you have the bitter knife wars in the 1550s-1580s; the bitter knife clan is the most serious remnant of cha'mutte's southern armies, but is completely defeated by dunmar in the 1580s (ish)


[10/29/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I took that from your Dunmar doc which had the war ending in 1576


[10/29/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
however many hobgoblins end up in the plaguelands and the rough terrain to the east


[10/29/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[10/29/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
these organize various incursions where they can. the blackened claw is one of the more successful


[10/29/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, ok. I thought the blackened claw came from Chardon.


[10/29/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't figured out what happened to the western hobgoblin kingdoms; would prefer to leave that undetermined for now. you might learn more when you go after the piece of rai under the ocean off the coast of that peninsula


[10/29/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
but chardon would have not let any escape south, i don't think


[10/29/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. Actually by moving the 1550s/1560s to non hobgoblin simplifies sembara dramatically


[10/29/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Basically the hobgoblins driven east from Chardon become the shattered ice clan and cause major trouble in 1570s - 1590s.


[10/29/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[10/29/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i think there could be some tension among the hobgoblins - you have a faction that was more on the violent/revenge side, susceptible to manipulation by mind flayers, and faction that is more refugee / wants a place to settle


[10/29/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
after mind flayer war and the stone titan one-shot, you have a bit of stalement and wars back and forth with sembara, but eventually the refugee side makes peace


[10/29/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
The bit I am struggling with is just that the timeline above has the hobgoblins in 1580-1590 and I want Cece to (a) come to power in 1650ish (b) defeat the hobgoblins as she comes to power


[10/29/2023 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
right that is why i'm thinking internal tension in hobgoblins


[10/29/2023 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
the 1580 war is driven by the warmongers, who want to reclaim what was promised by cha'mutte, who escaped the defeat against chardon


[10/29/2023 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
mind flayers use them to launch their war. mind flayers are defeated, and hobgoblins lose but perhaps not all the territory they conquered


[10/29/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
after a decade of a frozen conflict / border skirmishs, perhaps with hobgoblins gaining territory, you have an uneasy peace


[10/29/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
this lasts until 1640 or something


[10/29/2023 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
a new leader comes to power in the hogoblin kingdom (a series of bad winters leads to widespread food shortages, or whatever)


[10/29/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
this new leader launches a war for territory, breaking whatever treaties they had


[10/29/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
sembara decides they can't leave a hobgoblin kingdom on their borders


[10/29/2023 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
of course this changes cece a bit, the second hobgoblin wars. gives them a bit more of a retaliatory flavor, rather than a pure fight for survival


[10/29/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
I actually kinda like her with a bit of nationalist flavor


[10/29/2023 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
could leave exactly what happened in the domanion of whatever undecided / unclear - leaving open the possibility that e.g. another hobgoblin group under the leadership of some non-hobgoblin entity drove the leadership turnover


[10/29/2023 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
But also it is possible that her predecessor launches the war. Things degenerate in the years before he reign, etc. so she comes to power in the midst of a war sembara started but one sembara id losing


[10/29/2023 5:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that could work well


[10/29/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
I also like leaving why it started a bit vague. It was say 1639, which is 90 years ago from my game. No reason a clear description of why it started would be around


[10/29/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right so to summarize, from the perspective of Sembara, after 1549 when the Iron Fang clan is defeated in the Mostreve Hills, no hobgoblins threaten the borders until in 1574, the Shattered Ice Clan, fleeing defeat by Chardonian forces in the west, crosses the Sentinel Range, and in alliance (or subservient to) the mind-flayers, appears


[10/29/2023 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
This, the First Hobgoblin War, ends in 1578, with the defeat of the mind flayers. But Sembara is not unified or strong enough to push the advantage and a substantial remanent of the Shattered Ice clan establishes a homeland just south of Urlich and in the upper headwaters of the Enst


[10/29/2023 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
For the next decade, the Shattered Ice clan skirmishes with Sembaran knights on the borders, and slowly expands their territory, pushing especially a wedge south of the Enst between Maseau and Sembara


[10/29/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
In 1590, in alliance with some of the scattered clans of hobgoblins south of the Andonne, the Shattered Ice clan launches an attack on Maseau. Elaine I, the queen of Sembara at the time, refuses to abandon Maseau and embroils Sembara in the war


[10/29/2023 6:57 PM] .deciusmus
The Second Hobgoblin War lasts from 1590 until 1602. At the end of it, the hobgoblins control a swath of territory fairly far East from the mountains. But the war faction of the hobgoblins have been defeated and exhaustion sets in.


[10/29/2023 6:58 PM] .deciusmus
An uneasy peace is established and the border starts to be fortified (need to look at the map to see where the border would be exactly, but Cleenseau is near it)


[10/29/2023 7:00 PM] .deciusmus
This uneasy peace lasts for a generation, but it is never truly peaceful. Skirmishes frequently break out.


[10/29/2023 7:02 PM] .deciusmus
In 1644, something happens TBD and Sembara starts a new war with the hobgoblins. But it doesn’t go well. By 1647 the hobgoblin army has swept east almost as far as Fellburn.


[10/29/2023 7:02 PM] .deciusmus
(Cleenseau is conquered by the hobgoblins at this point)


[10/29/2023 7:03 PM] .deciusmus
Cece raises and army and pushes the hobgoblins out over a series of campaigns and by 1650 the hobgoblins have been pushed into the deep mountains. Cece stops there, fortifies the borders, and turns to internal affairs


[10/29/2023 7:13 PM] rsulfuratus
That seems about right. Would be good to summarize in the obsidian docs


[10/29/2023 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah working on that


[10/29/2023 7:14 PM] .deciusmus
I also revamped the sembaran royal dates


[10/29/2023 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a rough draft of the history above, plus some cleaned up dates


[10/29/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
great. i really need to organize an overall timeline at some point



[10/30/2023 8:35 PM] .deciusmus
I have this basic idea that the Shattered Ice Clan came out of the Sentinel Range and thrust down the Enst, eventually forming a kingdom approximately in the red section:

(and perhaps even a bit farther into the section labelled "borderlands')


[10/30/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
(partly, this is in service of the goal of having Cleenseau being a border fort / interior town / border fort / interior town in cycles to drive some undiscovered ruins beneath the current town)


[10/30/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I am copying all my OneNote addermarch notes to Obsidian now, will push (in worldbuilding) soon


[10/30/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but basically I don't have anything developed (at least that I care about) regarding poltiical history of the area. if they were on the border of a hobgoblin kingdom in the 1600s it doesn't matter to me.


[10/30/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
the only stuff I particulary want to keep is the current day vibe

{Reactions}
👍

[10/30/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
Actually, thinking about it, I wonder if the hobgoblins pushed all the way to the border with Tyrwingha, cutting off Addermarch effectively


[10/30/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
that would work too


[10/30/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
(Do you care about "TM1 and TM2" btw on the map?


[10/30/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
no


[10/30/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
We originally had some Tyrwinghan marches, but the development of Tyrwingha so far hasn't really had a place for them




Sentinel Range War - 1560ish. Mostly highland kingdoms, minimal impact on Sembara.


[10/30/2023 10:08 PM] .deciusmus
1st hobgoblin war- 1570s. Dunmore and western sembara bear the brunt


[10/30/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
Pushed back eventually - but a large reserve of hobgoblins ends up south of Urlich


[10/30/2023 10:12 PM] .deciusmus
2nd hobgoblin war - the hobgoblins pushes east along the Enst valley. Lots of back and forth and borderland destruction. Mostly focused on the lands south of the Enst. Addermarch and Maseau cut off


[10/30/2023 10:16 PM] .deciusmus
Unsettled peace. Not sure how it comes about but hobgoblins end up settling in a wide band from the marches of enford to the borderlands east of addermarch. This is a tough time for Maseau in particular as trade through the hobgoblin lands is rare and highly taxed and there are many downsides to being a relatively weak power on the border of a hobgoblin kingdom


[10/30/2023 10:16 PM] .deciusmus
Addermarch does better, being protected somewhat by the hills and drawing closer to Tyrwingha


[10/30/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
3rd hobgoblin war started by Sembara at the behest of Maseau. Starts badly, but ends in a series of 3 summer campaigns that push the hobgoblins entirely west of enford.


[10/30/2023 10:22 PM] .deciusmus
At the end of the 3rd war there are still scattered remnants of the hobgoblin clans in the mountains south of Urlich but they don’t regain enough strength during the Cece years to be more than a nuscrnse in the rest of sembara


[10/30/2023 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
By 1740 the@hobgoblins might be entirely gone or there could@still be skirmishes now and then depending on what makes sense for current day


[10/30/2023 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
when is 3rd war?


[10/30/2023 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
1646-1650


[10/30/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
2nd is 1590-1600


[10/30/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
So the unsettled peace is 1600-1645


[10/30/2023 10:27 PM] .deciusmus
(I have set the stage in 1719 that the western army definitely does fight real skirmishes and battles most summers, but it could be the campaigns to wipe out hobgoblins which could have succeeded by 1730/1740)


[10/30/2023 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus
the main enemy in the addermarch campaign was hobgoblins based in the edge of the plaguelands south of addermarch


[10/30/2023 10:29 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a whole different set of hobgoblins in the south


[10/30/2023 10:29 PM] .deciusmus
The remnants of the army that Derik III defeated in 1549


[10/30/2023 10:30 PM] rsulfuratus
could actually construct a scenario then where the plagueland hobgoblins and the urlich hobgoblins are actually bitter enemies, and the urlich hobgoblins keep maseau around as a buffer


[10/30/2023 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe one of the goals of the 2nd hobgoblin war is to break through the settled lands and reunite with the southern hobgoblins


[10/30/2023 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
Ooh I like that better


[10/30/2023 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure the implications for aurbez and the march of andonne


[10/30/2023 10:33 PM] .deciusmus
The plague land hobgoblins are also proposed in some notes as having an uneasy relationship that is not always entirely adversarial with the Auzbeg area- sort of a “we keep the worse stuff from moving west and in exchange you don’t follow our raiding parties back East”


[10/30/2023 10:34 PM] .deciusmus
But also I think in 1650 Andonne isn’t settled much


[10/30/2023 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
right, but also that could work going way back actually. perhaps after their defeat the plagueland hobgoblins are actually kind of less interested in expansion


[10/30/2023 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe they turn into like mad scientists or something, and mostly just want to keep to themselves in the plaguelands


[10/30/2023 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
even as far back as the 1600s are making little side deals with the various loose collections of humans who settle on the edges of the plaguelands.


[10/30/2023 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
when the expansionist faction of the urlich hobgoblins gains control they expand quick, but don't want to start a war with the mad scientists and keep some buffer countries around (who of course suffer a lot as they are paying tribute to two masters now)


[10/30/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
actually works with my addermarch lore as well since that was a splinter faction under the influence of a shadowfell warlock


[10/30/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess this would mean i need to start figuring out what kind of ridiculous creation a bunch of mad scientist hobgoblins would make with a city full of living acidic ooze that could challenge a 17th level party

[10/30/2023 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think that all works well although I never envisioned Maseau as paying tribute to hobgoblins much


[10/30/2023 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
In the “dark years” 1600-1645, yes, but probably only to the Urlich ones


[10/30/2023 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
I think the plague lands hobgoblins might have made little side deals with folks in Aurbez and Andonne… but also I kinda like the vibe where many of these people don’t even know there is a hobgoblin kingdom of mad scientists down their


[10/30/2023 10:44 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe it isn’t even only / mostly hobgoblins. Honestly keeping a little mystery seems more fun


[10/30/2023 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
The key thing would be that the hobgoblins of the plague lands don’t seem to be interested in expansion or conquest except some random factions here and there

(And maybe most humans think that’s because it is only random factions)

And secondly the urlich hobgoblins were scared/hated/etc them enough to want a human buffer zone

Actually this works well for the Andonne area as well — the early 1600s see a lot of the refugees who were packed into the Maseau/Enst valley fleeing south, away from the hobgoblins

yeah I think that works fine

And perhaps a similar influx of refugees from the Sembaran borderlands to addermarch as well. So addermarch and Maseau really develop as much more independent places in the 1600-1650 time, and then when Cece sweeps west the borderlands are left kinda empty no man’s land
