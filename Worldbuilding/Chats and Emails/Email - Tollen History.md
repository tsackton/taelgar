Sketched out a brief history of Tollen in context of a possible one-shot with Eric and Schwartz tonight, curious what you think. To convert dwarven dates to Drankorian reckoning, subtract 4133.

--  
  
Tollen was originally founded on the north bank of the Voltra river by the first mariner migrants from Hkar, before the Downfall, in the year 3902 by the Dwarven reckoning. Originally something of a backwater at the far eastern edge of the Green Sea, over the next 100 years it became a center of commerce and trade, and a place where the mariner culture, the northern culture of the highlands, and the non-humans (lizardfolk and halflings, mostly) of the western Green sea mingled. Even in this early age, Tollen was a religiously open and cosmopolitan place, and the worship of ~OceanGod~ coexisted with the developing Kestavan tradition.  
  
In 4050s, the Downfall Wars begin, and Tollen is cut off from the eastern Green Sea as long voyages become too dangerous and the ocean itself turns violent as storms wrack the seas and the great swamps to the south start to dry.  
  
Cities become dangerous and by 4122 when the Downfall Wars have ended, Tollen is virtually abandoned, and the land that will become Sembara depopulated, settled by scattered villages of farmers, with Embry and a few other river towns among the only significant population settlements.  
  
By the 4200s, the Skaer have established themselves as the dominant mariner culture in the western Green Sea, and resettle Tollen. Over the next 300 years, the Skaer grow stronger, spreading along the coast as far south as the mouth of the Semb, raiding upriver for timber and impressed sailors to row their great ships, and seeking converts for their religion. Tollen develops as a major trade center for the emerging Skaer empire, and begins to grow again.  
  
In 4491, the Drankorians reach the Mostreve Hills, and over the next 50ish years the Drankorians assimilate the inland people of Sembara and push the Skaer out, bringing with them the Mos Numena and the Drankorian influence.  
  
In 4547, the Drankorians and the Skaer sign a peace treaty, establishing the Volta as the frontier of the Drankorian Empire. Tollen, on the north side of the Volta, remains technically outside the Drankorian territorial claim. However, the Skaer are forbidden from bringing ships up the Volta, and Tollen falls outside their sway and comes under the influence of Drankor. While technically Tollen takes the name of the Free City of Tollen during this time, the Drankorian Empire controls its foreign policy as a protectorate.  
  
By the 4600s, during the Long Peace, Tollen begins to assert more autonomy. By now it has become a mixing place of Drankorian, Skaer, and Highlander culture, with diverse religious practices and where many languages can be heard. During this era the first merchant houses are established, becoming rich off the trade of dyed cloth south to Drankor, and the development of magical tattoos, especially those that could help sailors control the wind and sea.  
  

In the 4800s, as Drankorian expansion to the west begins in earnest and the might of the empire is focused to the east, the Tollen merchant houses have de facto control over Tollen, and Tollen has become a major city and one of the central mercantile powers of the western Green Sea. It is during this era that the University of Tollen is founded.  
  

When the Plague strikes, while Tollen is spared the worst of the chaos that envelopes the south, but plenty of chaos remains, and various wars and conflicts spiral out of control. While the university survives, and the city itself, most of its wealth is lost as trade is disrupted, and Tollen falls into a dark age. Little is recorded from the time between the Plague in 5192, and the late 5300s, when the Sembaran kings begin to grow in power.  
  
As Sembara expands in the south, Tollen recovers, and over the 5400s and 5500s Tollen experiences a renaissance of sorts, based on the growing wool and linen trade from the Sembaran heartlands. The lost art of magical tattoos are rediscovered and most of the merchant houses of Tollen today are established during this time period.  
  
In the 5600s, war comes to the Green Sea, first the battles against the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and then the Great War itself. Tollen, however, survives intact, and if anything grows in power and influence, as many of the Sembaran kings in the years after the Great War have ties by blood or marriage to the great houses of Tollen.  
  
Now, in 5881, Tollen commands a significant navy and is the undisputed master of the Western Gult, controlling the Straights of Cymea and asserting influence over much of western Cymea.

Yeah I like the low points. But I wonder if there should be a thread running through the whole history connecting back to the past…. I have a few ideas, will write up shortly. But not sure if they fit with your idea of Tollen.

======
a few thoughts, a little disjointed....
  
* I like the idea of Tollen being a place where people still talk, at least in certain contexts or certain guilds or schools within the university, about the ancient days, meaning the early 4000s. Why not have a place like London or Rome but where some philosopher's guild founded in Roman Londonium still survives? That's about the same timeframe. It seems like it would be one of the few places where that kind of thing really fits, and a rich source of interesting stuff. Of course half the 'we were founded in the dawn days of the city' things would really have been founded at various other times with ancient backstories, but some of them are probably real.

  
* I like the idea of Tollen always being on the 'edge' in the points where it wasn't powerful, and never being a major part of someone else's empire. That isn't to say it shouldn't have various ancient connections, but that it was never itself Sembaran, or Drankorian, or Skagen, at least not in an important sense.

* Is there a place for some kind of magical / extraplanar reason for why it is so religiously open? A connection to outer planes, or maybe it was defended during the Downfall Wars by an army of small gods, and something about that sacrifice magnifies the divine essence. Or something.

A few other times in history that you've outlined that seem fraught with possibility:

* The Drankorian peace treaty. My history below centers Tollen as the architects of the peace treaty, and maybe there are reasons why. A storm giant foretold the downfall of Drankor if they expanded past the Voltra, and Tollen had evidence? Some kind of divine intervention, the divinities of Mos Numera insisted Tollen remain free? Maybe there is something special about the place that makes all the various gods of Taelgar keen to ensure it is never fully controlled by a single set of gods. 
* Praying on the powerful-religion idea, maybe there are a set of worshippers of the old <OceanGod> floating around Tollen. Or various void-mind gods. 

  
Here's an idea for an alternative timeline that keeps Tollen independent the whole time... not sure if it fits with your vision, I won't be offended if you toss it :)


----


What if the earliest settlers of Tollen were explicitly the misfits and dissatisfied with the marnier culture (not sure what it is like exactly, but I imagine by the 3900s the <OceanGod> was dominant in a way that would allow some questioners or people not wedded to the mariner way of life to want to strike out). I'm thinking a bit of a Roger Williams or some of the other 'free thinker' early New England settlers vibe. 

  

From that earliest point, Tollen gains a reputation as a free-wheeling place of stories and misfits and those who are looking for a new life. And with them comes the curious from other cultures, and it turns out the Highlands and the mariners have a lot to sell each other, so then comes the merchants.

  

In the 4050s, the Downfall War certainly unsettles things, but that doesn't mean Tollen has to be abandoned. The merchants flee, and the city shrinks dramatically, but it is not abandoned entirely.  

  

By the 4200s, the Skaer re-discover Tollen, and although it largely becomes a Skagen city, some ancient institutions of storytellers, knowledge seekers, and free-thinkers maintain their place in the city (need some kind of event to make this work out), and Tollen remains a place where the Skagen religion does not hold sway entirely.

  

Throughout the 300 years of the Skagen dominion Tollen grows as a marnier culture, and grows as a center of commerce. Many supposedly ancient institutions survive in the city however, although who really knows how many are truly ancient, as opposed to institutions that invented ancient roots to gain prestige or maintain independence from the Skagen protectorate.

  

By 4547, the Drankors are on the doorstep and the Skaer are at war with them. It is Tollen that brokers the peace treaty between the Drankorians and the Skaer, earning an uneasy freedom from both the Drankorians, who refrain from formally conqueoring the city in exchange for de facto control of its foreign policy, and from the Skaer, who are forbidden from sailing up the Voltra.

  

From here, your history keeps it independent as well.

===========
Lots of great ideas here. 

Definitely like the idea of people still talking about the ancient days in Tollen, although of course what is true is always hard to know, but some of the institutions that claim to date from the old mariner days before the Downfall wars actually do. 

I also like the idea that it was never the center of anyone else's empire. It was the western edge of the Skaer empire, the northern edge of Drankor, etc. During the Great War years when Derik III claimed overlordship of all the land of Sembara, Vostok, and Tyrwingha was probably its least independent moment in some sense, but even then it was never truly Sembaran (although this sets the stage for the intertwining of the Sembaran royal house and the upper echelons of the Tollen merchant class in the 1600s). 

  

I will think a bit about the gods and why it is such an open place. Doesn't need to be sorted out clearly now, this feels like something to explore via actual play instead. 

  

I do think it is useful/interesting to have a few "gaps" in Tollish history, specifically around the Downfall Wars and around the First Plague. Doesn't mean the city was entirely abandoned -- maybe the only people who stayed through the Downfall Wars were the ancient philosopher's guild or whomever, and when the Skaer resettled 100 years later they found weird old sages living in the ruins. 

  

I do like the idea of Tollen as central to the treaty that stopped Drankorian expansion, and it makes sense for this to have some kind of magical "great powers" connection -- either divine, or perhaps something connected to dragons or giants or elementals (fey are taken by Tyrwingha). Will think a bit more on this, again might be something best to see what happens during a game.

I think at this point (the Great War), so much bad is going on that Tollen merchant guilds and leaders and such probably felt uniting with Sembara was necessary for survival. Probably some kind of formal grant of privileges, i.e. Derrick is overload, and controls foreign policy, and the Tollen navy is subsumed into the Sembaran (or whatever), but the city itself remains the Free City of Tollen, and manages its domestic affairs as it pleases.Tollen would be exempt from the Sembaran system of justice, and probably owe taxes only in some vague "annual gift" sense that Tollen collects entirely on its own, etc.

Yeah. Some mystery here is appealing as well.  I also think it's a good hook for some mystical weirdness. In game, I imagine it would come through as an unusual openness to lots of different gods, and also a place where maybe there are weird temples to forgotten gods, or whatever.

Yeah, this is kind of what I was imagining, not a thriving city. But also, that the core of the leadership/moral authority of Tollen is some set of institutions that have been independent 'forever', especially in their own mind, if not forever.
