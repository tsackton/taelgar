So two of my PCs are playing Tyrinwingha priestly-types, and one with a fey-focus so I've been thinking a bit more about Tyrwingha. Here are some thoughts, what do you think?

---

In ancient times before the Downfall the Tyrwinghan people were not really differentiated from the other humans in the Greater Sembara region and would have worshipped the same proto-kestavo as the rest of Sembara. However, this area has always had an unusually large number of portals to the feywild, and so fey are more common here. And therefore mixed up with the proto-kestavo are a number of worship traditions around fey spirits as well.

  

Then, sometime around the Downfall [ intentionally leaving this vague ], the region of coastline around what is now Tafolwern gains the attention of Ethlenn, Queen of the Evening Mist. Why? Who knows. Legends say a desire to see the sunrise, or a mortal lover, or a moral saved her life, or she saw some beauty in the love between the first king and queen that she wanted to preserve, or a powerful warlock created her a jewel that captured the light of the sun, or something. (Probably none of the legends are actually correct).

  

For the next several hundred years, the character of religion changes, as the fey, and in particular Ethlenn become more prominent. The kestavo don't vanish, but Ethlenn becomes the focus of a lot of human attention [ and who knows what this does metaphyiscally? ] This really just reemphaizes some of the extisting trends.  
  
Then, in the DR 300/400s when Drankor invades, Ethlenn explicitly makes a deal to accept the Eight Divines as the gods of the realm as part of the treaty with Drankor. And thus she redirects a lot of worship away from herself, and an Mos Numena religion develops. But like in Sembara where it developed with a kestavo flavor, here it develops with a fey flavor.

  

Unlike in Sembara, I think the Tyriwinghan Mos Numena tradition is not intercessionary -- there are temples to all 8 divines like in Chardon or Cymea.

  

But in Tyrwingha, the fey are still respected and if not worshipped, exactly, it is part of the role of the temple steward not only to revere the gods but to watch out for the fey. This leads to lot of little, unique rituals around the Tyrwinghan religious hiearchy that are fairly unique. Everyone knows that the fey are not the gods,and the gods themselves are not 'fey-inspired', but for historical reasons the 'diplomat/good-relations' with the fey role is also, at the local level, part of the temple hierarchy.

  

At a higher level, the oracles of the riven, and the warlock/sorcerer fey magic users are also important, but I think there might be a distinction between the "high and mighty great fey powers" (i.e. Ethlenn) and the "lets keep the local fairies who leak in from the feywild happy so they don't steal our crops"

  

Thoughts?

============

I think this mostly makes sense. I like the idea that this was just a naturally high-fey area of the world (already canonically possible since the footprint of the gods from Kenzo's solo - where he went and helped the creature from the Land of the Dead who was wounded by Grash, is a place where the spirit realms are close to Taelgar). And I definitely like the idea that in Tyrwingha, the temple stewards have this secondary role of keeping the local fairies. They might also be associated with / responsible for helping people who decide to take Ethlenn's bargain and leave Taelgar for the Feywild do so. 

  

Not sure though that it really makes sense for Tyrwingha to be non-intercessionary. That feels like adding too much complexity to the world? Obviously from a practical point of view it is perfectly realistic to have many many different flavors of a particular religion but from a worldbuilding and especially a playing perspective I kind of think it is hard to keep track of. We had originally developed the "Greater Sembaran" variant in the western green sea (cymea/vostok/sembara/tyrwingha) and the "Chardon" variant in the west, and to me that feels like enough complexity. 

  

We never really figured out exactly how the Mos Numena tradition changes from Drankor to Sembara, but I assume it is a kind of local diffusion where places that were sacred to a particular Kestavo become associated with one of the Eight Divines instead. No reason why the process wouldn't have worked in the same way in Tyrwingha. 

  

But open to discussion on this point. I like everything else.

=============

I do agree the world doesn't need a ton of complexity. But I was thinking a third variant of Mos Numena could fit nicely in the world, and I actually liked the idea that my players from Tyrwingha would see the Sembaran religious traditions as a bit foreign. I like having Tyrwingha have some meaningful differences with Sembara, although maybe the fey-tinged is enough.

  

Anyway, here was my basic thinking, which I'm happy to discard if you are not convinced:  

  

At a high level, I was thinking the following:

  

(a) Semabaran variant of Mos Numena is characterized by a secular temple hierarchy and a priestly hierarchy that is very separate and disorganized, with a large emphasis on memorializing miracles

(b) A Chardonian variant characterized by a more organized priestly class that is more officially members of the temple hierarchy 

  

Then, within the Sembaran variant, there are two "flavors" 

  

(a) intercession flavor, where the tradition is only one god per temple and that god talks to others for you

(b) a more 'standard variant were people worship all the gods

  

The flavor would be pretty similar, but the idea that the wanderer intercedes on behalf of the other gods type thing is the main difference,

  

What do you think?

===============================

I would argue the main divisions have to do with the solutions to the theological problems of how to avoid "interference." 

  

The Drankorian tradition, which evolves into the Chardonian / western tradition, relies on temple architecture. All temples are functionally to "the Eight Divines" but are constructed in such a way to isolate each section. In richer, bigger cities, this is a complex with eight separate buildings (effectively, these are cathedrals); in smaller places, this copies the original Drankorian architecture with an eight pointed star or some such thing, mimicking separate buildings. But in this tradition, there are no Temples of the Mother. 

  

The Greater Sembaran tradition, which relies on moving away from temples of the Eight; instead, a temple is associated with a particular god. In big cities, you would probably have temples (possibly multiple temples) to each of the Eight, but smaller places would make do with one, usually associated with the patron divine of that town or village. There are also numerous shrines, holy sites, and other such locations scattered across the landscape that may not have a formal structure but are considered holy places of a particular Divine. 

  

Separately, you have varying attitudes towards the religious hierarchy, but this doesn't map perfectly to the Drankorian/Sembaran divide. 

  

-in Chardon, following the Drankorian tradition, there is a fairly organized priesthood, and recruiting a powerful priest to a temple is a key part of the temple steward's role. Organized religious orders are also fairly common; these often descend from Drankorian orders. In the northern parts of the west that worship Mos Numena but are not Chardonian, these orders probably extend, so to a certain extent you get kind of Christian vibe with trans-national religious hierarchy. E.g. in Mawar or Illoria, you have temples to the Eight that are potentially hierarchically connected to Chardonian temples. Similar in e.g. Darba or other places where Mos Numena is the minority religion.

-in Sembara, you have a lot of hostility to organized religious orders, so there is this kind of disorganized priesthood. This is probably shared in Vostok too. 

-in Cymea (and probably Tollen), you follow the Sembaran temple tradition, but also have a fair bit more acceptance of organized orders. Probably not quite like Chardon, though. 

  

That said, I think you could make the intercessory idea kind of uniquely Sembaran (or, probably, Sembaran + Vostok, the places where the kestavo were strongest) without changing the fact that temple architecture is the same across Sembara, Cymea, and Vostok. 

  

In Tyrwingha and Cymea, there isn't really the idea of intercession. Villages would still have a patron divine and a single temple to that divine, but there would usually be shrines or holy places or things like that if you really needed to pray to a specific god that wasn't the one the temple is dedicated to. But maybe portfolios are a bit broader - if the Sibyl is the patron divine of your village, it is sort of assumed that everything happening in your village is under her sway.

===========

RIght, ok, I really like that actually and it makes a lot of sense. 

  

That also makes the idea of intercession something that can be somewhat fluid. Everywhere across greater Sembara, the temples are each only to one divine. In the heartland of the kestavo tradition, the idea of asking one god to talk to another is very strong and has carried forward into Mos Numena. But in other places perhaps that idea is weaker, and prayers might be offered to each divine. But small villages would still make do with one 'dedicated' divine, often, or perhaps two, and that kinda makes them into the village god.

  

So in a small, traditional village in Tyrwingha, the village god might be the Father, and thus the temple dedicated to him, but people would still offer prayers to the Mother for a  good harvest, it just wouldn't be through the temple, and would be 'smaller'. And of course they'd offer prayers at the temple as well, for a warm summer, say, or whatever. And maybe as a village gets larger it is more and more likely they'd have a second temple, to the Mother, and then a third to the Night Queen. So a market town in Cymea of 1500-2000 people might have 4-5 temples, one to each divine.

  

In Sembara, this doesn't happen except in the various largest of cities. Instead, there is a strong tradition that the temple of the Father just grows and everyone asks him to talk to the others
