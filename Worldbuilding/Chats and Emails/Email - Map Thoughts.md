A few thoughts on the 'blank' areas....

  

Looking at the climate map and the people movements map, it seems like there are a few big blank areas...

  

**The central steppe.** 

  

Between the two major deserts and south of the medium mountain chain that marks the western border of "eastern Dunmar", I think this is a perfect place for orc hordes, weird bad guys, and strange stuff. It isn't great climate in general, being mostly dry. Lots of wild animals. Hard for traders to get through. I'm envisioning it somewhat like Botswana/southern Africa. Probably no meaningful human inhabitants since Drankor fell.

  

This makes the eastern Dunmari more connected along the coast of the Green Sea to Cymea and the neo-east than to the western Dunmari. And if they aren't really seagoing (which is totally culturally reasonable) they could be quite isolated in general. But their land is fairly fertile, maybe still somewhat swampy in places with a bit of a north Florida feel in some places. Or maybe it has a south China feel -- Hong Kong or even Hanoi.

  

**South Cymea**

Maybe it would make sense to move the BSk wider to the north, so the Cwa region starts around the two big lakes.

  

You could then imagine that this is really part of the central steppe. Basically say that Drankor expanded north along the rivers, but South Cymea was always a bit marginal and was never a major population center, except for a strip along the coast. So "south Cymea" is really the southern part of Cymea, maybe culturally distinct, but really much more a strip of civilization along the coast with largely wilderness at their western backs.

  

So basically, you'd have this big central wilderness, stretching from line of the central mountains / the Kharja River, in the west, the Mostreve Hills in the north, the "south Cymean" mountains and the "south/east Dunmar" mountains in the east, and the Sea of Storms in the south that is basically wilderness.

  

Most of this is desert/plaguelands/steppe, but some small patches in the north are Cwa/forest.

  

On the edges of this wilderness are some polities -- the Republic of Auzberg and the various Sembaran southern marches in the north, plus the elven kingdom of Olenas; a somewhat culturally unique "south Cymean" group of folks living in a strip 50-75 miles along the coast; the eastern Dunmari, on the other side of the mountains on their peninsula along the Green Sea.

I like this. I think this central steppe area is a natural "wildlands" that has kind of always been unsettled and difficult. The "frontier" during the Drankorian empire, with little beyond it but desert, so no point in trying to conquer it. This would make the "south/east" culture north of the desert like Vostok in a way, in that it was never Drankorian but was influenced by them.

  

I have actually never been clear in my mind whether the mountains between the deserts are the western or the eastern border of "eastern Dunmar." 

  

One possibility is that before the fall of Cha'mutte, you still have some arid desert in the far east, basically west of the "east Dunmar mountains" and into the interior a bit, like the eastern 25% of the Garamjala, and then to the north you have wetter grasslands shading into forests. Basically, from west to east you have Dunmar, "south Irebor", and "east Dunmar", and then north of those, starting from the Green Sea, "south Cymea" and "Irebor" until the mountains. Dunmar stretches further south, but south of "south Irebor" is wilds shading into Drankor, and south of "east Dunmar" is arid steppe and desert. Then, further east, you have the Hong Kong / Hanoi kind of culture in penisula sticking north into the green sea above the desert.

  

The alternative would be to push the east Dunmari east, into the peninsula. But I actually like having them in the interior of south Cymea, basically, and perhaps wrapping around some along the southern edge of the mountains in an overland route to the peninsula and desert. There would be more survivors here, and I imagine  this as more of mixed culture.

Looking at this some more, there is really no reason why south Cymea would be dry. Further south, due east of Dunmar, yes, you are in the high pressure latitudes and have some mountain rain shadow. But around 35 N should be pretty wet, like SE US or central China.

Yeah, I'm not sure this fits. I think pre-Great War, perhaps there were big forests stretching south from the two lakes and east towards the coast. West of the forest you have Irebor in the river valley, which is wetter to the north and dryer to the south. East of the forest along the coast you have South Cymea, which shades drier as you move south, to a semi-arid steppe on the interior, which is "east Dunmar". Basically say three or four groups, the Ireborians (split perhaps north/south), the south Cymeans, and the east Dunmari. 

  

Post war, Irebor is gone, and south Irebor is the heart of the Plaguelands. The elven kingdom is still there, but much of the big forest is now dead, although not all. Towards the coast, you have south Cymea on the coastal side of the forest, completely cut off from the interior but trading north and south along the coast. Then south of them and shading inland, basically north east of the Garamjala, you have the east Dunmari. The south and east of the east Dunmari you have wilds, which has always been wilds. On the penisula you have a totally different culture, a mixing pot of central/south/east, north of the desert, which was less affected by fall of Drankor and fall of Cha'mutte.

So something like this:
	
![[Pasted image 20250120093457.png]]

Where:

*  NI = North Irebor, now wasted plaguelands except for the Refounded Republic of Auzberg. BSk climate.

* SI = South Irebor. Was once fertile farmlands / grasslands on the borders of Dunmar. Now blasted plague desolation full of dead people

* BF = A large, ancient old-growth forest. Perhaps the only remains of the ancient elven kingdom from pre-Downfall. Even more blasted and dead now, with the plagues and such. But a little bit remains in the northern part. I kinda like the idea that there is an ancient dead forest, haunted, etc that used to be part of the elven kingdom but now no one goes

* SC = South Cymea. Really just an extension of Cymea (and maybe a bit more coastal and further south than drawn)

* ED = Eastern Dunmari. Before the Great War, they'd probably have cultural continuity with the western Dunmari to some extent - the journey would just be across Irebor. But sundered now, because of the plagues and such. Perhaps a bit smaller and less coastal than drawn. And could stretch all the way south around the mountains.

* HK = New "hong kong climate" people. Mixing zone that was like the east northerners in Vostok but with "old easterners / southerns / western Dunmari". An interesting place for a brand new culture we haven't made up yet. Probably has stronger ties to Cymea than anywhere else, but worth having a sketch of from a Sembaran point of view (unless they are strongly non-coastal and kinda live in the interior of the area.

* CS = central steppe. Probably in earlier times (before the Great War) this was smaller and didn't cover the river areas to the west (so ended kinda with the lines of the mountains in the center of the map above). But the upheavals of the Great War that dried out the central Dunmari plain also dried out this land. Probably the border of "CS" and "SI" used to be significantly farther east. And way back in the Drankorian days the "better" part of the land (say the western 1/3) was likely inhabited, but not by folks who survived the Drankorian collapse in any recognizable way. Perhaps there are some nomads who trace their lineage back to Drankorians and who somehow survived the Great War. Or maybe it's all hobgoblins and orcs and worse.

  

I think that all makes sense. The alternative would be to stretch SC down all the way to the mountains where ED is, and put ED where HK is.(Maybe that is what you meant? Where HK would go farther east?)

Just to add, looking at your people movement maps, this basically changes the Great War map so that the Dunmar get past the "black hobgoblin zone" as a group, and push east and west, the with east group taking some of the "Post Drankor" red area (which splits into Irebor in the west, Cymea/South Cymea in the north, and eastern Dunmari in the east/south). And the area the Dunmari did go into stays kinda eastern/southern mix.

  

Having a big forest also suggests that the Drankorian expansion probably had two routes -- up the river valley (Irebor) and along the coast (Cymea) with kinda gap in the middle where there is a big forest they didn't dare cut down.

=====

Yes, this is exactly what I had in mind. I like the implications for Drankor expansion, perhaps the 'coastal route' to Cymea was first and so that is behind Cymea's stronger connection to old Drankorian ideas. 

  

I'd stretch the forest a bit further south, so it is more of a barrier to free travel between Dunmar and East Dunmar; the fact that these two groups split presumably to do some fundamental disagreement about how to proceed on their migration north would somewhat reduce cultural continuity as well. I think of East Dunmar as a bit more Drankorian influenced, sharing a language and a religion with Dunmar but without a lot of the "chosen for a higher purpose" feeling, and maybe a less deep sense of connection to the gods -- probably real, because perhaps the gods were kind of disappointed with the group that turned east, if indeed the Dunmari did have a divine purpose for being where they are (e.g., fighting Cha'mutte or something). 

  

I also think South Irebor would be more marginal land than Irebor. So pre-Great War, south Irebor is still largely along the river, maybe in a bit of an arc curving to the northeast, stopping at the furthest east river. I'd also push SC down the coast a bit, and have ED more inland and into the mountains.

  

What you are calling "HK" I have a rough idea for, basically this is kind of the melting pot of the Green Sea. You have the old blend of east and south migrants originally, and then some influence from trade with the desert/central people, and connections to both Cymea ("old-east") and the big island ("neo-east'), plus Drankorian influence but not conquest. So I think of this as kind of a trade nexus, maybe in some ways like North Africa / Egypt / the east coast of the Mediterranean, and also a cultural mashup, perhaps a place where many different religions thrive, more like a "traditional D&D" world where there are random temples to various gods and they all are seen as together in some sense. Maybe all gods are worshipped and this is a place where you have temples to individual members of the Five Siblings, the Eight Divines, and others, whatever is in the desert and perhaps even one or two of the old mariner gods. This was also the former lizardfolk empire/homeland, so that might have some influence but not sure what yet. 

  

But I have games to run tomorrow for Isaac and Saturday for you so not likely to have more time to think about this specifically until later. :-) Only got pulled down the climate wormhole as I was trying to sort out what is east of the Plaguelands for reasons.

Yeah this is great. So basically from a "modern" Sembara perspective this changes things a little only in the sense that probably you'd have South Cymea really culturally very similar to Cymea. Basically one area "Cymea" with some variations along the south coast (South Cymea) and the west coast (West Cymea). Then you'd have a new "Melting Pot People" who are pretty distant, but probably do have meaningful trade with Sembara, especially as they'd be the great crossroads. And at somewhere between 1000 and 1500 miles from Tollen, they are probably about the same distance as Venice -> Jerusalem, which wasn't particularly far in medieval times. And the east Dunmari tucked in somewhere.

====

Yeah. I think south Cymea is like the Cymean peninsula equivalent of the Sembaran highlands or Tyrwingha. As a shorthand until it is relevant in a campaign it is all just Cymea but if one of us were to at some point set a campaign on the Cymea coast (or had I run the Tollen campaign, instead of the Dunmar one), this would develop into some interconnected variation like Sembara. 

  

From a modern Sembaran perspective, the eastern Dunmari are probably more "distant" than the melting pot culture, since the melting pot is connected to the sea and trade but the eastern Dunmari aren't, and there really aren't surviving land trade routes that run southeast from Sembara.

====

Yeah. Just FYI the broad plot arc I have mapped out for the campaign I will eventually run is likely to go -> western Sembaran marches -> Auzberg or somewhere near the mountains -> Tollen -> Zovcka/highlands -> Underdark/mind flayer caverns

  

So I expect to be making up Tollen-influences at some point.


====

Cool. I have a lot of ideas about Tollen and I started sketching out some stuff I liked a lot when I was kicking around campaign ideas in my head for options to run with the high school crowd, so let me know when you start thinking more about Tollen as I will have a lot of comments / opinions. 

  

The highlands and the western marches I feel like are much more your thing and I'm pretty happy to let those develop however you like.
