(From Kiya, brainstorming notes, Jan 2023)

One take, of course, is a blend: the gods here have a more fey-oriented flavor than in other places.  
  
So, for example: perhaps here the Mother is crowned with horns, which are deer-like as well as the horns of the moon.  Perhaps here the Night Queen is often portrayed as a *stellar* goddess rather than the more darkness-flavored nature that is in other places, raising her status/respectbility.  Perhaps the Wanderer has in his domain as governor of outcasts all the fairy-folk that are actively trouble and is thus darker in flavor.  Just little flavor-oriented differences in attitude and background, brought about by how the fey nature shapes the official religion.  
  
Historically speaking in the real world the folkloric realm of the fey overlaps with the realms of nature spirits, the dead (particularly the more ghostly variety as opposed to the peaceful dead), discredited gods and lesser divine beings like angels/demons, and so on. One can make a glorious mish-mash out of all sorts of things in a D&Dverse that way, really.  “Is this restless ghost becoming a fey” is something for which there are probably *protocols* so one doesn’t exorcise something rudely; at the same time I’d expect corporeal undead to be treated as Serious Problems, not just the druidic distaste for undead but the notion that a spirit trapped in a dead body cannot be free to either pass on to a human afterlife or seek the path of becoming a fey.  
  
  
But at the more basic level, there are a lot of different things that people might do.  Obviously, there will be respect for fey-touched *places* (like the sentiment in Ireland that’s reasonably common that goes something like, “I don’t believe in fairies but don’t fuck with that rock or the fairies will get mad, everyone knows that”).  Some of those will be taboo entirely - don’t touch, move, or damage that rock or tree, don’t go up that hill after dark or on particular festival days, etc.  Some will have rules and protocols: if you do this thing, you must leave that kind of offering.  If you go here, don’t dance or they might keep you to dance forever.  Etc.  
  
Then there will be cultural taboos, customs, and habits.  Some people hold that the fey have claimed particular colors and take vengeance on humans who wear them without permission (sort of magical sumptuary laws); I was actually thinking of that when I *didn’t* take any green on the Heroforge fig design I did for this character, operating under the assumption that he would take green clothes as taboo, just as a thing.  
  
But it’s a wine-producing region; you might get a ‘drop three (or seven) droplets of wine from your fingertips before you drink to give honor to the fairies’ as a custom, say.  A refusal to directly do certain things that some fey take offense to, using language circumlocutions instead (never offering direct thanks, never asking for (or giving) a name but instead saying something like “What may I call you?”).  Treating looking people in the eyes directly as rude/aggressive (because of gaze effects/vulnerability to bespellment).  Smiths who work in cold-forged iron would presumably be treated with great care and their work handled extremely superstitiously.  Perhaps musical instruments are decorated in a way that makes them less likely to be stolen by pixies.  
  
Local aesthetics would get *weird*.  Both the surpassingly beautiful and the grotesque would be well-represented in local art.  Hybridized figures - plant/animal/human mingling together - would be common.  People or animals with birth defects would probably be _extremely_ well taken care of, in case they’re secretly fairies, which might produce a different culture around congenital disabilities than in other places.  
  
There will be rituals and appeasements for the weather and the seasons, often considered fey-linked.  Burning grain dollies at the harvest, perhaps.  Proper rituals about the treatment of blood shed after slaughtering livestock, so as not to draw the attention of the more bloodthirsty and darkly chaotic fey.  
  
In general I would expect the culture to have a lot of respect for liminal and transitional states, and to hold a lot of power in fey-aligned things.  You already have the culture being more arcane-magicky than other areas, but I’d expect that all those weird ambiguous states of being would have a particular cultural oomph as being obviously feytouched; the question is, of course, whether that oomph is considered benefic or malific in a particular case.  It would certainly be considered _potent_.  
  
(Which means the Wyrdling could have higher status there than elsewhere in Sembara, as the god who clearly governs the ambiguous, transitional, and mad.)  
  
(Oh, BTW, your more detailed god writeup assigned storms to the Wyrdling but your brief notes in the GM binder assigned storms to the Wildling, you should probably tidy that.  Unless it’s shared demesne.)

In the history of Tyrwingha, there is a distinct difference between the Eight Divines, explicitly imported from elsewhere and the fey, the native-home-grown creatures. I think the flavor is more likely to be that they are kept separate (after all, both the divines and the fey are real creatures, so there is no doubt about what is real). 

  

So rather than the divines picking up a fey flavor, I think the temple organization would be the ones to pick it up. So it isn't that the divine aspect of the Mother has horns; but rather, in the temple of the mother, there are also the antlers gifted from an elk-fey and they are the honored treasure of the temple. It would be very bad luck should any harm befall them, and each fall when the elk rut, the tradition is to stage mock elk-ruts to remind the elk-spirit of his mortal brethren. This ritual is a very important job of the temple steward of The Mother, but it doesn't change her character per se.

There is a very particular source and destination of human spirits in Taelgar (and separately, of fey); so the restless spirits becoming fey is not metaphysically likely or likely to be a big concern. In particular also, the fey are real beings, with a realm (the Feywild) and such. So I think the transitional/liminal nature of some fey traditions would be less important in Taelgar -- discredited gods do exist, but they don't become fey; same with angels, demons, etc. The _Feywild_ itself is of course a transitional place in many ways, with its own complex rules. But I think the fey would largely be seen as 'their own' thing, not something that a ghost or a discredited god or an angel or a demon might become.

  

Of course, a fey might pretend to be any of those things (successfully, even) for their own purposes, entertainment, or mischief.

Yes yes, to all this.

Yes to all of this, I think it all works well.

 > (Which means the Wyrdling could have higher status there than elsewhere in Sembara, as the god who clearly governs the ambiguous, transitional, and mad.)

I haven't quite settled if the idea of different gods having different relative status is quite a thing... I think if the gods themselves smacked down the people who tried to treat one of the eight as better than the others, it would stop pretty fast. I do think the Wyrdling would have a different importance, as perhaps they become somewhat associated with the feytouched -- something that isn't so common elsewhere.

  

The exact implications I'll have to ponder a bit.
