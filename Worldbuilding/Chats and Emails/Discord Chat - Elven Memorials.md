Two unrelated questions:
(2) how would elves think about war dead? would their be memorials? graves? seems like they would be treated differently than elves who leave when they want

On elven war dead, I think there would be some sense of lose, like they were artificially cut off from Adanor

So a memorial might celebrate that connection and therefore be living?

yeah like the idea of something living. mostly want to check that it wouldn't seem weird for their to be elven memorials to the war dead, in the same sense it would be weird to have elven graveyards.

The first thought that comes to mind is something like an elaborate and enormous flowering tree. I think the vibe would very much be about memorializing the connection to Aldanor. Perhaps even something spontaneous- like the elven forest expressing its own loss of these elves who were still entangled with the mortal world

I‚Äôm not sure elves would build memorials so much as tend to them
