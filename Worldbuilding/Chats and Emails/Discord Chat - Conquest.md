I think the bigger worldbuilding question is: given all the danger out there, and magic, and the gods, do humans actually regularly fight wars of conquest?


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
No, I think probably not


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think I agree


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, sometimes things happen - i.e. Chardon + Dunmar. But you don't have stuff like the Norman Conquest of England that often


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm thinking about the approximately 1000 wars fought over siciliy, for example


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
you could imagine a scenario where northern cymea is constantly changing hands to control the straights


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
or the long term war between the english and french kings over france


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the question then is, the absence of wars of conquest, what changes alliegance? i think generally there would be a very strong incentive to be allied with someone bigger


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is a feeling of safety


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example most of the Drankorian conquest of Sembara isn't really a war. it is "we have a huge army and a million wizards" and the sembarans going "awesome come stay"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Sure


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Although there are exceptions, i.e. the highlanders


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right, obviously


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it *all* has to be "no war conquest"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
no, of course not, but a lot less than in the real world


[1/4/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, agreed
