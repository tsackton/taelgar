the idea would be to
(a) rewrite the Species/Languages doc to be more "in-world" but include the "real-world mappings" where they are relatively canonical
(b) potentially create a Mechanics/Language Rules that defines which sets of languages are "related" for D&D language purposes


[7/12/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
(the ultimate goal would be to let my players select languages from the full set in Species/Languages, i.e. I'm sure that Celyn (kiya's PC) speaks both Tyrwinghan and Sembaran...)


[7/12/2024 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah there is definitely a bit of tension in the current doc between mechanics and in-world lore


[7/12/2024 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that seems worthwhile


[7/12/2024 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
to be honest though I'm not sure that I find languages mechanically very interesting - your party always seems to complain when you can't speak to people and it usually just doesn't seem to be worth the hassle


[7/12/2024 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
which might suggest it would be worthwhile to actually be a bit broader about language groupings - e.g. if you understand any of the post-Drankorian languages you can understand all of them


[7/12/2024 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
Languages are mechanically more interesting when they are easier to learn


[7/12/2024 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
My complaint with D&D languages is not that they exist but that by RAW you cannot ever learn new ones. I made a house rule where you can learn a new language every other level


[7/12/2024 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
But there is an alternative where it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to distinguish other than between broad language families


[7/12/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
My intention in the doc is have language families well defined ‚Äúin world‚Äù (and probably at 2 levels) so it would be easy to have a mechanic that says D&D language X is all languages I. family Y


[7/12/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus

[7/12/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
What language do you think Tollenders speak natively?


[7/12/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
Sembaran? Something else?


[7/12/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
probably Sembaran, right?


[7/12/2024 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, Sembaran


[7/12/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I think in practice you'd actually have both Sembara and Tollen speaking in the modern day a kind of Sembar-Tollish mix, that has Drankorian, Tyrwinghan, and Skaer influences


[7/12/2024 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
I've actually structured Sembaran names as pretty French/English mix, so it kinda works to have Sembaran be a more blended language, with a lot of loan words from a Germanic (Eastros) and a Romance (Westros)


[7/12/2024 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
I'm less sure about Tyrwinghan influence. I see Tyrwinghan as kinda like modern Welsh or Irish -- most people speak Sembaran, it kinda surives in backwaters but didn't have a ton of influence on the larger devellopment of Sembaran


[7/12/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but where does Tyrwinghan come from? I always imagined it as "old" - e.g. retaining some mariner elements


[7/12/2024 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
Although historically, it is more than it surived as an ancient tongue during the Drankorian years, and I think the "Tyrwinghan Drankorian" and the "Sembaran Drankorian" evolved together into "Sembaran"


[7/12/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so more similar perhaps to Skaer than anything else


[7/12/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
while some people in Tyrwinghan still speak the ancient language as well


[7/12/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
or maybe only


[7/12/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
but pre-Drankor, I think the "northern mariners" which are basically Tyrwingha, Skaer, and Highlanders are all speaking probably similar-ish languages, aren't they?


[7/12/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
yes, although I'm not sure if it is necessary to decide if Tyrwinghan has some unique influence.


[7/12/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, of course


[7/12/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Kiya has gotten into the "its Welsh" so that's pretty canon at this point. Welsh has a nice property of being Indo-European but neither Germanic/Slavic (which is my model for Eastros) nor Romance (for Westros).

But also the mapping from Taelgar to human languages doesn't have to be exactly perfect in terms of language families.

In general, I've tried to leave undecided the question of who exactly the ancient Tyrwinghans were


[7/12/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Also is Skaer and Zimvoka really similar? I thought of Zimkova as Northern not Eastern


[7/12/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
yes the original naming Tyrwingha is very Welsh influenced


[7/12/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess Zimkova is fairly northern, yes. it is more Vostok that is mixed, but I think Tollen would fall into the kind of "mixed northern/mariner" lineage when originally settled


[7/12/2024 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
the language in the western green sea is actually kinda complex, as it is the only place I think where we have a melting pot of all 3 major (defined) human exoduses from Hkar


[7/12/2024 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[7/12/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
there probably should be an ancient tongue that was once spoken in the coastlands of the western green sea that was derived from Eastros/Northern tongue


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I think actually the Eastros / Westros / Northros / Southros or whatever might be worth retconning, I'm sure no player cares about that


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
*the names I mean


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
my idea has always been that on Hkar, there was just one language, Human. like there is just elvish, just dwarvish, etc


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but each migration started a new language family


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
in the doc I'm writing I eliminated Southros entirely (as "not canon yet") and "retconned" Eastros/Westros/Northros as Drankorian words for different languages they observed


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but they would be speaking westros themselves


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
eastros and northros make sense


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
right, westros is a bit weird


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
because it would have just been Drankorian


[7/12/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I guess this is a decision that would be worth considering. I've always assumed that "trade tongues" exist which are like simplified versions of actual languages and are represented mechanically by Common (with Eastros and Northros being "other language family" equivalents)


[7/12/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
but this would be distinct from actual langauges


[7/12/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
here's what I wrote:

## Trade Languages
Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. Many non-human creatures also know trade languages, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. Trade tongues are best thought of as pidgins, and they rarely allow for the full nuance of a native tongue. There are two trade tongues in common usage:

- **Westros**: Sometimes also called simply **Common**, this is a pidgin heavily derived from Drankorian, but with numerous loan words from Chardonian, Sembaran, and other languages of the Westros language family. It is particularly wildly known in Dunmar and amongst travelers and traders across all the regions that were once part of the Drankorian Empire. This tongue is commonly spoken by travelling non-humans as well.
- **Eastros**: A trade token derived from the languages of the Eastros language family, it is widely spoken in the eastern Green Sea, and can be heard as far west as Tollen and Cymea, and even occasionally in the port cities of Sembara. It is very rare outside the Green Sea region.

[7/12/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is good


[7/12/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
might want to fiddle with names


[7/12/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
I think I'm renaming the "Westros Language Family" to "Drankorian Language Family"


[7/12/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
based on the idea of defining Northos and Eastros as Drankorian words for cataloguing languages


[7/12/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
but also agree that changing the trade tongue names would be sensible


[7/12/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
historically these things didn't have very clear names (i.e. lingua franca), it would be reason to just call it something like

Green Sea Trade Tongue


[7/12/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Western Trade Tongue


[7/12/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean if we want to be complicated we should have the drankorian version, which is e.g. taught in the university of chardon still and is like the "academic but slightly culturally imperialist" version, and then what the people who speak those languages call them, translated to english


[7/12/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
you mean for the language families?


[7/12/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right, assuming the name for the trade pidgin dervies from the language family as well


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I mean, if you had a name for the ~Unamed Mariner Language~ some derivation of that would make sense for the name of the green sea trade tongue


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so to a Drankorian scholar, you have the Eastros language family, the Northros language family, and then High Drankorian and Low Drankorian


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
where Low Drankorian = the trade pidgin


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
which actually is probably the original trade pidgin of Hkar


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
right although I aslo think that _at the time of the Empire_ the pidgin probably didn't exist.


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
would Hkar even had had a trade pidgin? I thought it would just be "human"


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
maybe there was an ancient "human pidgin" spoken between species


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
that say, halflings spread as much as humans did


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
because hey, halflings need a language to talk to their customers in


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
actually...


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
what do halflings speak to other people in


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
well also once people start leaving hkar and languages diversify, there is still for a while a lot of back contact with hkar


[7/12/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i actually have often wondered if the trade pidgins are acutally halfling languages


[7/12/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
wellby picked up Eastros awfully fast


[7/12/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
I envisioned Eastros as very similar to lingua franca historically, which was the trade tongue of the mediterrian


[7/12/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
whereas "westors"/"common" seems less clear


[7/12/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. in the middle ages there wasn't a trade tongue because people spoke latin


[7/12/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
but it would be interesting maybe to define "Common" as a Hkar/original human-language trade tongue spread by halflings primarily


[7/12/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
and so kinda something you might see anywhere, and not necessarily derived from Drankorian


[7/12/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
you then might retcon a bit and say that Drankorian is sometimes also used as a diplomatic language, especially before the Great War. You can imagine all of the big councils between Chardon/Sembara/Isingue in the high school campaign being conducted in Drankorian


[7/12/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
maybe that's too big a retcon...


[7/12/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think from a game perspective I don't love that, because having an ancient language that shows up in a lot of ruins but isn't widely understood in the modern world is a very useful trope


[7/12/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
what about this:


[7/12/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
I don't entirely disagree, although I think there are a lot of potential opportunties for new ancient languages. But also perhaps Drankorian has faded significantly since the Great War, and is no longer a common diplomatic tongue.

Sembara is largely isolated, and in Dunmar and Chardon, Chardonian has surplanted Drankorian (ala French in the real world)


[7/12/2024 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
- humans are created on Hkar speaking Human, and there is enough magic in the early days that while the language changes, it doesn't diversify - Hkar is big but people are teleporting and such and so you have just, Human. there are no Firstborn to keep things fixed in place of course, but still


[7/12/2024 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
- as people start leaving, they tend not to come back, at least not quickly, but went they do it is to the communities they left from. this starts to introduce some language drift - you get both new languages forming and some splitting of "Human" into dialects


[7/12/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
- the first migrants (ancestors of northerners) don't really maintain contact with Hkar, so the northerner languages feel pretty distinctive (hence Semitic languages as real-world mapping)


[7/12/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
- (possibly there are unnamed southern migrants that also establish unique languages, or these just diverge a lot after the downfall, not relevant now)


[7/12/2024 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
- when the mariners leave, however, there is a lot of travel back and forth, however, and you start to get at least two major dialects of human, that drift apart, and perhaps leads to the creation of a Hkaran pidgin


[7/12/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
- when the Downfall happens, while the settlement of Drankor is dominated by the urban city dwellers of Hkar, they are not all who survive, and the initial empire is somewhat mixed linguistically


[7/12/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
- then, post downfall, you have three developments: (1) in the growing Drankorian Empire, you have the mariner dialect kind of dying out / merging with the Hkaran pidgin, but the persistance of two languages. Drankorian proper serves the role of Latin, basically, but more like Latin in the middle ages than Latin during the Roman Empire. Anyone educated would speak it and it is the trade tongue, but plenty of "commoners" speak only the Hkaran pidgin


[7/12/2024 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
- (2) around the green sea you have a fair bit of language diversity, and so you get the development of a true linga franca, perhaps inspired or maintained in large part by halflings; this is what the Drankorians later call Eastros


[7/12/2024 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
- (3) in the north, there are at this point a diversity of northernern languages, and there is perhaps yet another pidgin that the Drankorians call Northros, but this kind of dies out because the Drankorian pidgin (Common) spreads and replaces it - a language that lets you talk to Drankor is a more useful trade tongue


[7/12/2024 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
- then after the fall of Drankor, the Drankorian pidgin survives but "High Drankorian" doesn't, except largely as a written language of scholars


[7/12/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
so in the current day, you have Common, which is basically the remants of the the original Hkaran "Human" and you have "Eastros" aka the Green Sea lingua franca, as the only (developed, pending the south) trade tongues


[7/12/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
One comment: I think pidgin/trade tongues should be rare(ish). I don't see any need for example to posit a "northros"


[7/12/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that's fine too. Northos could just be the name for the language family written by drankorian scholars


[7/12/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
Also generally no one speaks a pidgin as a first language (that is what makes it a pidgin)


[7/12/2024 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
So what's the first language of the "commoners" above?


[7/12/2024 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is like a creole actually. the first language was "mariner" but that kind of dies out


[7/12/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
Right, so per wikipedia a creole is what you get when you start having native speakers of a pidgin


[7/12/2024 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe it doesn't work perfectly, since the end result should (a) the persistence of a "Common" pidgin, and (b) the development of a bunch of Drankorian-language-family languages


[7/12/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
Right, the main game-problem to solve is why is Common so common


[7/12/2024 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
so, here is maybe where halflings come back


[7/12/2024 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
or just non humans in general


[7/12/2024 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I kinda like the idea of Common being totally unrelated to Drankorian per-se but just a human-derived tongue


[7/12/2024 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
elves are pretty common in drankor, so are dwarves and of course halflings


[7/12/2024 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
But set aside common for a moment...


[7/12/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a clear picture of:

* An original tongue on Hkar (human)
* Each large migration from Hkar tended to create a new language family but currently only 3 are defined: Northos family (from the first northern migration), Eastros family (from the mariners), and Drankorian family (from the post-Downfall migration to Drankor)


[7/12/2024 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
* A lingua franca, perhaps partially halfling maintained, develops in the eastern Green Sea, and is a common trade tongue there, and is called, by Drankorians at least, Eastros


[7/12/2024 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
Then I think there are two open questions:
* Where does Common come from? 
* Was/is there a "shared" Drankorian-derived language ala Latin or French in historical periods in Europe, and if so, is it (a) the same as Common, (b) Drankorian itself, or (c) something else


[7/12/2024 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
Options for Common are 
(a) a shared Drankorian derived tongue
(b) something derived from the original Hkaran human language
(c) something halfling derived or non-human derived that is not specifially related to any human language families


[7/12/2024 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
I personally kinda like the idea that Common is not a Drankorian-derived language at all, but I'm not sold on any particular answer.

I guess from a established-facts perspective, Common was pretty rare when we were out in the east


[7/12/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think from established facts there is a kind of Common / "Eastros" line somewhere east of Cymea with Eastros becoming increasingly dominant the further east you go


[7/12/2024 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that the halflings are the most interesting through line to everything


[7/12/2024 3:10 PM] .deciusmus
But also, halflings tend to go in routes that loop around, right? I mean, the Green Sea halflings don't usually go on trade runs across the continent from Sembara to Chardon


[7/12/2024 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
well, some of them do. the Charmhearts for example


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
but, yes, this would be rarer


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
I thought the Charmhearts went back and forth from Embry <-> Chardon,


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, you don't usually have halflings going from Irrla to Chardon


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
or Medju to Chardon


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, right, yes, Sembara is kind of the inflection point as that is where you go from sea based to land based


[7/12/2024 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, my idea about halflings is less that Common is a halfling language, but that somehow interacting with halflings leads to these pidgin tongues persisting in a way that they might not otherwise


[7/12/2024 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., perhaps Common is basically the original Hkaran "Human" language, and Eastros is the original mariner language. humans live longer and change quicker and don't have a racial memory to fall back on so their languages change fast


[7/12/2024 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
So you could imagine something like:

In the years after the Downfall, Drankorian spread as a language and for the most part, it was used as the common language across the whole western part of Taelgar.

But when Drankor fell, and the disruptions of the plague and so on occurred, and as the different parts of the old Drankorian empire lost touch with each other, the common language collapsed, and mutually unintelligble languages started to develop.

But the halflings kept alive a Drankorian-derived trade tongue


[7/12/2024 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm actually thinking the same story but further back


[7/12/2024 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, Common could be as you say, Hkarian/original human


[7/12/2024 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
But then why didn't it persist in the eastern Green sea? Historical happenstance is a reasonable answer I guess


[7/12/2024 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. Common = Human, and it persisted in the Drankorian empire (despite the spread of an alternate lingua franca) because non-humans, especially halfilngs, kept speakin git


[7/12/2024 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
one idea is that the mariners left hkar in part in explicit rejection of the urban elites


[7/12/2024 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
part of that explicit rejection was linguistic


[7/12/2024 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so halflings in the mariner-influenced parts of the green sea speak the mariner lingua franca not the drankorian lingua franca


[7/12/2024 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
Right, although I guess Common is more like a Hkaran lingua franca


[7/12/2024 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[7/12/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing says it couldn't be what the elves in the southern continent use to talk to the humans in the southern contiennt


[7/12/2024 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[7/12/2024 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
basically it leaves open the south entirely


[7/12/2024 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
So eastros develops as an explicit rejection of "Common", rather than a "natual language evolution"


[7/12/2024 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[7/12/2024 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so revising, I would say:
- Common = Hkaran, was the original language of humans
- Northerners left, speaking Common, but the language moved on and their language evolved as there was not much contact, and there was no northern lingua franca and honestly not a lot of halflings up there either, so you get a new language family just from drift and natural change
- (southerners TBD)
- mariners leave as part of an explict rejection of urban Hkar and linguistically evolve with intentionality, creating the mariner language family (which the Drankorians call Eastros)
- halflings and contact with other nonhumans maintains the original Hkaran lingua franca as Common, but humans in the Drankorian Empire speak Drankorian as their first tongue, which then diversifies; a similar process happens in the east but with "mariner" instead of "common"


[7/12/2024 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I think then that means the default is that any human population could plausibly have maintained Common as a lingua franca / trade pidgin, if desired


[7/12/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
here's what I have in Obsidian

## Trade Languages
Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. Many non-human creatures also know trade languages, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. Trade tongues are best thought of as pidgins, and they rarely allow for the full nuance of a native tongue. There are two trade tongues in common usage:

- **Common**: An ancient trade tongue derived from the original language of humans, it is commonly used by non-humans, especially halflings to conduct business and trade, and is widely spoken by traders and travelers across the lands that were once part of the Drankorian Empire.
- **Eastros**: A trade tongue derived from the languages of the Eastros language family, it is widely spoken in the eastern Green Sea, and can be heard as far west as Tollen and Cymea, and even occasionally in the port cities of Sembara. It is very rare outside the Green Sea region.

%% 
Background Note: ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ developed as a separate tongue from Common primarily because of the mariner's explicit cultural rejection of the Hkaran elite, who spoke the language Common is derived from. Eastros is in turn a remanent/pidgin derived from the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~. Halfling telepathy and long-lived non-humans are the primary mechanisms that prevents linguistic drift of these trade tongues. 
%%


[7/12/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
human populations where common is rare, or where a different trade pidgin is spoken, should have an explanation


[7/12/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I would also add a background note that Common may well be spoken in far flung parts of the world - as it doesnt have any explicit connection to Drankorian it doesn't have to be limited


[7/12/2024 3:25 PM] .deciusmus
added:

Common could reasonably be spoken as a trade pidgin anywhere, and human populations where common is rare, or where a different trade pidgin is spoken, should have an explanation.

## Human Language Families
The human tongues of the known world are broadly divided up into three major language families based on ancient migrations and cultural divisions on the original human homeland of [[Hkar]]:

* **Northros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken across the northern reaches of Taelgar, named Northros by Drankorian cataloguers of languages. These languages are spoken by the cultures that departed Hkar in the ancient days.
* **Eastros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken primarily across the eastern parts of the [[Green Sea]], as far west as [[Skaerhem]]. This language is derived from an ancient mariner culture that originally settled much of the [[Green Sea]] region, and these languages were given the name Eastros by Drankorian scholars.
* **Drankorian Language Family**: A set of languages spoken by [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and those cultures that inherited the Drankorian cultural traditions. It is derived from the language spoken on [[Hkar]] and the time of the [[The Downfall|Downfall]].

There are some other human languages, notably Dunmari, that do not fit into any of the language familes above, and there are rumors and fragments from Drankor of other languages spoken in the far east or far south, which may not fit into these categories as well.


[7/12/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I think actually it is worth being explict about Dunmari. The Drankorian scholars might not have written much about it but it is basically the sister tongue to Drankorian language family (hence using the Indo- side of the Indo-European languages to represent it)


[7/12/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
basically the Dunmari (and possibly some others) were the last group of pre-Downfall migrants from Hkar


[7/12/2024 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to be explict about Dunmari in the section where I write the actual languages

%% Background Note:
This section is intended to be both canonical and sufficiently vague as to not block new invention. Broadly, the assumption is that each of the [[Human Cultures of Taelgar|migrations from Hkar]] map to a specific language family:
* Early Explorers = Northros
* Pre-Urban Exodus = undefined southern tongue
* Mariner Migration = Eastros
* Downfall Refugees = Drankorian

Where the minor migrations, such as the Dunmari, would have potentially unique histories, and may or may not fit into one of the language families above, 

When determining real-world language analogues:
* Northos in general uses Semitic languages
* Eastros and any subsequent migration use Indo-European languages, with Eastros tending towards Slavic/Germanic, and Drankorian tending towards Italic/Hellenic. Other migrations (i.e. Dunmari) that are after the mariner migration should probably be their own branches of the Indo-European language family.
* The Pre-Urban exodus is explicitly undefined, and could be Indo-European or something else

Non-Human tongues should generally avoid Indo-European + Semitic, to maintain distinctness but this is not a hard-and-fast rule.

[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
What language did the Vargaldi speak?


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
should they have their own language?


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
you only talked to them in Eastros


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
(or with magic)


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
right


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
so probably they have their own Northros derived language


[7/12/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I would assume. Jotha was able to pick it up fairly quickly, for example


[7/12/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
however I tended to use slavic names for them, not that I think it really matters that much. their writing system is almost certainly mariner-derived, for example, and probably have a bunch of loan words from eastros


[7/12/2024 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
we need a name for ~Unnamed Marnier Language~


[7/12/2024 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
on a related topic, for calibration, in the real world it looks like the best estimates have proto-indo-european spoken between 4500 - 2500 BCE, so like 5000-6000 years ago


[7/12/2024 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
with a lot of the proto-Italic, proto-Germanic etc early divergenes spoken ~1000-500 BCE, so 3000-3500 years ago


[7/12/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually can't find my notes in Obisidan about when humans were created


[7/12/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
ah found it. 1750 per Timeline Notes in brainstorming. so that is like 4500 years that humans have existed, but significantly less time that human languages have been diverging


[7/12/2024 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
well, Drankorian languages have been divering for like 700 years, right?


[7/12/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[7/12/2024 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
reading about the history of romance languages, it actually would make sense that prior to the Great War lots of Drankorian languages were mutually intelligible.


[7/12/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
pre Great War there is likely some divergence between the western and eastern sides of the mountains, especially since Dunmar is a clean linguistic break in between


[7/12/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I was about to say the same


[7/12/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
they are also drawing loan words from very different source: northros in the west, eastros in the east


[7/12/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
So probably you do end up with 4 languages:

Chardonian
Sembaran
Isinguese
Cymean

But Isinguese and Cymean are likely even now close to mutually understandable (i.e. Portugese and Spanish) although Isginuese is dying out

(although I'm not sure what language the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez speaks...)


[7/12/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that works.


[7/12/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
well, you might also have Illorian in the west, with a similar relationship with Chardonian as Isinguese / Cymean


[7/12/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Is Illorian drankorian?


[7/12/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, although with a lot of loan words. Drankor built the canal after all and founded Darba


[7/12/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
you had a note in "Human Cultures of Taelgar"

%% Illoria seems like a place that could have a cultural descendancy from the "southern" exodus, although probably not a cultural connection. Perhaps Illorian is a unique language that is more related to Southern than anything else? %%


[7/12/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
ha forgot about that


[7/12/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
but I'm not really sure that makes sense


[7/12/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I kinda think it makes more sense as Drankorian


[7/12/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
or, rather, Illoria was certainly occupied and settled by Drankorians. perhaps there is a unique reason why they have a remnant language, but I don't have a good idea at the moment


[7/12/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., there is certainly space for a tywingha-like aspect of Illorian that coexists with a more drankorian version, but no reason to create that now


[7/12/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
on the western branch of the Drankorian languages there are also likely a number of somewhat mutually intelligble Chardonian-like languages that were spoken by a variety of post-Drankorian northern kingdoms, of which Chardonian is the only one that survived the great war


[7/12/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and, I do kind of wonder if Isinguese it its own language whether Tollish should be as well, but one that has a very close relationship with Sembaran. probably not worth inventing that much detail though


[7/12/2024 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno, I'm kinda into making up language details


[7/12/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
I think it would actually make sense for there to be a Tollenish as well, which is where sembaran gets it English


[7/12/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
Tollenish is an blended Eastros/Drankorian tongue with Germanic roots that was historically related to Skaer and spoken all along the Sembaran coast


[7/12/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
right, actually having Tollish (I think Tollish instead of Tollenish) and Sembaran converge to mutual intelligibilty from distinct roots is kind of nice


[7/12/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
If anyone got *really* into the details, there is probably a southern Sembaran and northern Sembaran, where southern Sembaran is more French and northern Sembaran is more English


[7/12/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
and northern Sembaran is closely related to Tollish


[7/12/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
from a game perspective its all a dialect specturm where Sembaran/Tollish are all the same.

But it gives an opportunity for an "Old Tollish" as an ancient no-longer-spoken language that is not the same as Sembaran or modern Tollish


[7/12/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
and could be where the Tyrwinghan & Vosic alphabets come from


[7/12/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
maybe that's too much detail but it kinda makes sense


[7/12/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
actually in the very first campaign with Isaac and Nathaniel I had a scholar who knew Skaer but could read old Tyrwinghan inscriptions, so it is dubiously canonical even

added some mostly minor comments but I think at this point easier to edit via discord + obsidian that git pull requests. 

the two major gaps for me are
(a) the languages of other planes really need more substantial thought
(b) there is definitely a cultural thread that feels like it is missing from the history of the west that I need to sort out a bit at some point, but the language doc is not the place for that


[7/12/2024 9:03 PM] rsulfuratus
so i am going to merge

[7/13/2024 11:46 AM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm working on one more update to languages. Basic idea:
- push the exotic races and extra planar to own pages so I don‚Äôt have to publish them for my players and we can leave them less canon
- rewrote Chardon to leave the northern west coast ambiguous


[7/13/2024 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm also simplifying Northros to leave the Vargardli in a comment and position Mawaran / Old Zimkovan / Deno‚Äôqai more as examples of a wide undefined set

[7/13/2024 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
in my west coast thinking I am feeling like there is, potentially a missing cultural group. the issue is that a lot of the stuff that's happened north of charrdon is kind of dubiously canonical - all from high school campaign and my game with Isaac


[7/13/2024 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
but I think this impinges on the Vos a bit as well, who are fairly unsatisfyingly developed IMO


[7/13/2024 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
We structured the Hkar migrations to make it quite easy to add a ‚Äúsecond dunmari‚Äù group


[7/13/2024 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
the missing cultural group is the post-Drankor, pre-Great War northern kingdoms that were never conquered by Drankor


[7/13/2024 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
Ie a migration that left say just before the downfall


[7/13/2024 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
the vibe from high school was kind of medieval german, these were like Volkrad and related


[7/13/2024 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
the main distinction is I don't think it is quite right to have only the northerner / Deno'qai and the Drankorian strands in the north


[7/13/2024 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
the two options that I've thought of are (a) another Dunmari-style migration, pre-Downfall, and (b) a western migration of the easterners/mariners that stretches across the mountains


[7/13/2024 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
Right. It would make perfect sense that there was a late migration from Hkar, worshipping a form of Mos Numena, and speaking Germanic


[7/13/2024 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
I don‚Äôt like the mariners making it so far west


[7/13/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, okay, I wasn't sure about the mariners


[7/13/2024 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
so then the question is about mirgrations east. the Zimka and the Vargald are definitely northerners and related to the deno'qai


[7/13/2024 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
the Skaer are definitely mariner


[7/13/2024 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
but I'm actually not entirely sure about the Vos


[7/13/2024 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
My headcannon which does not need to be actual canon is something like...

(a) a broad group of Northerns, worshipping the kestavo gods and speaking a northros language ("old Zimkovan" currently) come over the mountains and spread in a broad swath between the Sentinels and the Svinjo mountains, but staying in the land of rivers and hills, not heading down toward the coast
(b) the Skaer come from the east, with a totally different culture, and settle along the coasts


[7/13/2024 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, that I agree with


[7/13/2024 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
but I am a bit unsatisfied with the Vos as just a Skaer/Northern mix


[7/13/2024 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I agree. I think currently, there are probably at least 5 cultural traditions:

(a) the "traditional/old" Zimka who still speak the original Zimkovan language and still, today, worship kestavo
(b) the "new/highlander" Zimka (Ardlas/Lavnoch/Breva) who have intermarried and intermixed with Sembara much more heavily, and speak their own (probably Eastros) languages and worship Mos Numena. Perhaps culturally similar to Tollen
(c)  the Skaer, who speak their own Eastros derived language, and worship their own god
(d) the Tyrwinghans, who speak their own language somtimes (unclear derivation) but are quite Sembaran in some ways and worship Mos Numena
(e) the Vos, who are somewhat poorly defined


[7/13/2024 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
actually, plus
(f) the Tollenders, who speak their own language, closely related to Sembaran, and who worship Mos Numena


[7/13/2024 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
then of course the Sembarans, Isinguese, etc


[7/13/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
The Tollender history is quite well defined, as effectively emerging from a schism within the broader Skaer culture between those who became heavily Drankorian influenced vs those who didn't


[7/13/2024 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure that is quite right. I've never thought of the people of Tollen as having a particularly close cultural or linguistic connection to the Skaer


[7/13/2024 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
that feels like a fairly significant retcon?


[7/13/2024 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I maybe misread your Tollen history


[7/13/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
But I thought it was a Skaer city post Downfall?


[7/13/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
from the Tollen page:

By the 4200s, the Skaer have established themselves as the dominant mariner culture in the [[Western Green Sea]], and resettle and rebuild Tollen. Over the next 300 years, the Skaer grow stronger, spreading along the coast as far south as the mouth of the [[Semb]], raiding upriver for timber and impressed sailors to row their great ships, and seeking converts for their religion. Tollen develops as a major trade center for the emerging Skaer empire, and begins to grow again.


[7/13/2024 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so the idea was something more analagous to london. founded by Skaer, but then they left


[7/13/2024 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
basically when drankor shows up the skaer give up tollen


[7/13/2024 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
Ok, I see. This sentence is doing a lot of work:

However, the Skaer are forbidden from bringing ships up the [[Volta]], and Tollen falls outside their sway and comes under the influence of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]].


[7/13/2024 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah the tollen page needs some cleanup


[7/13/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn't trying to retcon, just going from the Tollen page


[7/13/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe Tollish should be a more Drankorian-derived language than I had it, i.e. not Eastros


[7/13/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, ignoring that all for a minute, I still think the basic division of 7 cultural tradtions ("old Zimka", "new Zimka", Skaer, Tyrwinghan, Tollen, Vos, and Sembaran) is a good starting spot


[7/13/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[7/13/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
Here's what I have at the beginning of Sembaran history:

In the aftermath of [[The Downfall]] the land that will become [[Sembara]] is lightly populated. The [[Kestavo|kestavo-worshipping]] [[Zimkova|Zimka]] live in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]], and have spread amongst the highlands, and down the valleys of the great rivers: the [[Semb]], the [[Volta]], the [[Teft]], and the [[Wistel]]. Along the coast, [[Skaer]] mariners raid, intermarry, and settle amongst the Zimka, and a Skaer-dominated mixed culture spreads from [[Tollen]] to the mouth of the [[Semb]]. The once mighty [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] swamps have mostly disappeared, save for remnants: [[Ozabal]], at the mouth of the [[Wistel]] and [[Latazaro]], in the east, where a thriving lizardfolk communities remain. South of the Wistel is the mixed community of humans, clustered along the coast, united by the their shared allegiance to the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], but otherwise the southern lands are largely empty of humans.


[7/13/2024 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
Which I think still stands


[7/13/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that seems right


[7/13/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
The "Skaer dominated" mixed culture, becomes the substrate for 3 cultures, I think: Sembaran, "new Zimka" ,and Tollen


[7/13/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
But all three are heavily influenced by Drankor


[7/13/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
But I actually think the Vos are both more complex that just "the Vos" and something else...


[7/13/2024 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
So you basically have...

"Old Tollish" culture, which is the Skaer dominated coastal culture, speaking an Eastros language. 
Zimka, up in the mountains
Trywinghans, in Tyrwinghan

Then when Drankor comes along, the Skaer part of the Skaer dominated flees. And Drankor splits the Old Tollish culture into 3:

* Sembara, settled by Drankor
* "New Zimka", in the highlands, separated and evolving separately from the original Old Tollish, but culturally resistent to Drankorian influence
* Tollen, along the Volta and parts of the coast, culturally open to Drankor, but independent


[7/13/2024 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
that suggests that Tollish is probably a Drankorian language, very similar to Sembaran. Whereas Old Tollish is a potentially lost Eastros language, but is the lingusitic ancestor of "new Zimka"


[7/13/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
here is a possible tweak


[7/13/2024 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I think the idea pre-Drankor is that you have the martime Skaer empire, which is very maritime, and goes upriver a bit but basically does not settle inland


[7/13/2024 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so there is already a growing split among the Skaer, between the settlers and the sailors


[7/13/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the old mariner religion was probably a pantheonic one, with more than a single god. the idea behind the Skaer is that only Kaikkea survived


[7/13/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but pre-Drankor there could already be some religious splits happening


[7/13/2024 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
we've already vaguely established the mariner religion as for some reason more prone to schisms and evolution than Mos Numena, which is largely unchanged (in divinity, if not in human practice) since Hkar itself


[7/13/2024 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so leaning into that, you have the mariner pantheon fragmenting a bit


[7/13/2024 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
that gives you three distinct religious traditions in post-Downfall, pre-Drankor Sembara:
- the Skaer, worshipping Kaikkea, who are powerful maritime empire but don't settle away from the coast, speaking an Eastros language
- the Zimka, in the highlands, speaking a Nortros language, worshipping the Kestavo, and drifting down river valleys
- the Tollish, worshipping the non-Kaikkea parts of the old mariner pantheon, speaking an Eastros language, but diverging culturally from the Skaer pretty quickly


[7/13/2024 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
(this is basically what you wrote but adding the religious twist)


[7/13/2024 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, when Drankor comes, the Tollish gods just die out.


[7/13/2024 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
and the Skaer retreat


[7/13/2024 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
the Drankorian "conquest" of Sembara doesn't really involve wars, so perhaps the Tollish assimalte pretty quickly. maybe there is a magical thing, the Drankorians ride in to save them from a dragon or whatever


[7/13/2024 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
theorectically, this could leave Tyrwingha as the remnant of the old Tollish culture


[7/13/2024 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
Right... although the interventionist trend in Sembaran worship was meant to come from the kestavo tradition. So I'm not 100% about the religious twist. But largely seems sensible


[7/13/2024 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, right, so maybe it is better if the Tollish are kestavan


[7/13/2024 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe for some reason the mariner gods are dying already. something about the downfall kills them, only kaikkea survives


[7/13/2024 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus
or the downfall sickens them and over the next 100 years all the mariner gods but Kaikkea stop responding to prayers


[7/13/2024 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, that could work. I kinda want to leave who exactly the Tyrwinghans are slightly undefined because it could become relevant to my game. But I think the general idea of the Skaer/Zimka/"Tollish" split works well


[7/13/2024 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, they don't need to be the ancestors of the Tyrwinghans


[7/13/2024 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
Exactly whether the Tyrwinghans are Tollish or not probably doesnt matter, although I like the idea that Tyrwinghan language is written with the Eastros alphabet


[7/13/2024 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
I also like the "new Zimka" (i.e. Sembaran highland kingdoms) to be remenant of the old Tollish culture, speaking an Eastros ather than Northos language (as I've used Slavic pretty heavily in naming)


[7/13/2024 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus
from a linguistic point of view, I kind of think that perhaps Sembaran and Tollish should be kind of analagous to what might have happened to english if the norman conquest involved a dramatically bigger population shift


[7/13/2024 12:36 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that was my idea


[7/13/2024 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is a bit hard to classify. uses the drankorian alphabet, but is it really an eastros language or a drankorian language? it is kind of a fusion

Sembaran probably originated as a creole language between Old Tollish and Drankorian


[7/13/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
maybe there shouldn't be  aseparate Tollish language at all... and Sembaran should be pretty distinct from Isinguese/Cymean


[7/13/2024 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so that is the direction i was going


[7/13/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
I've actually played Sembaran in my naming as a very random mix of English and French


[7/13/2024 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I think a Tollish dialect makes sense, but kind of like catalan vs spanish. tollish has a bit more eastros loan words, sembaran a bit more drankorian, but they are mutually intelligeble and closely related

[7/13/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
So you could imagine something like:

Old Tollish, the language of the original Tollish culture that existed immediately post Downfall. No longer spoken, but does survive as a scholarly language in Tollen. Eastros/Eastros alphabet.

New Zimkovan, derived form Old Tollish, but adopted the Drankorian alphabet. New name for what we used to call Highlander. Eastros language. 

Sembaran. A creole that developed as a mix between Drankorian and Old Tollish. Fairly distinct from the rest of the Drankorian languages. English/French. Drankorian alphabet.

Tollish. Closely related to Sembaran and but with slightly more Eastros loan words and flavor.


[7/13/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
And then Tyrwinghan is somewhat undefined, but was clearly influenced in alphabet at least by Old Tollish.


[7/13/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
right, plus Insinguese and Cymean which are much more proper Drankorian languages, and while possibly mutually intelligeble are probably not so with Sembaran


[7/13/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
Skaer & Old Zimkovan are their own things (Eastros/Northros).
And Isinguese and Cymean as you say - mutually understandable but not with Sembarans.


[7/13/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
Culturally it leaves Vostok somewhat ill defined.


[7/13/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
(although, for a game that doesn't want to consider languages too much, you could mechanically decide that all the "Eastern Drankorian" languages fall into a single mechanical language)


[7/13/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. vostok does not feel like it is either Old Tollish or Skaer or Zimkovan


[7/13/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I think Vostok is something else. Originally northern


[7/13/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
But not really part of the Old Tollish cultural spread.


[7/13/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
or, potentially, a migration of the western non-northern, non-Drankor culture


[7/13/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, although it is weirdly placed for that. Although lots of reasons that a new culture could have ended up there


[7/13/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
`I think that I would leave Vosic for now as a bit of an orphan language, not clearly part of any language family, similar to Tyrwinghan


[7/13/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. I actually think there could be pretty clearly 2 Vosic languages


[7/13/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Aren't lots of the coast of eastern Vostok heavily Skaer influenced?


[7/13/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
Should there be a "Coastal Vosic" that is clearly similar to Skaer? Or is that overselling the connection?


[7/13/2024 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, there are really potentially as many as four vos cultural threads, perhaps even more:
- a coastal vos culture that has a long association with the skaer, although not sharing a religion. 
- the "lakes and rivers" vos culture that is very undefined but largely not skaer influenced and probably not northern either
- the kind of tollen hills culture, imediately east of tollen and near the straights of cymea, that is a lowland / coastal culture but one that is more distinct from the skaer
- potentially a northerner / zimka culture in the upper volta valley


[7/13/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
The current Vostok doc says:

Most of the population lives in the southern part of Vostok, called Voslaag ("home of the lowlanders"; often called South Vostok or South Vosland in [[Sembara]]), within a hundred miles of the coast, and along the lower [[Kem]] river valley. This is a region of few cities, few roads, and difficult travel, with lots of uninhabited land even within the most organized territories of major clans and chiefs. Boats, both on the rivers and the coastal [[Green Sea]], are crucial to trade, travel, and communication throughout Voslaag. 

[[Cymea]] and [[Tollen]], with their strong naval traditions, have often looked to Voslaag for tribute and resources, whether extracted by violence or as part of recognition of an outside overlord. But these relationships - beyond some annual tribute (oftentimes labor, such as sailors for the navy) and a perhaps a personal relationship between a Vos and Cymean or [[Tollen]] leader - have left little impact on the internal culture and politics of Vostok. 

Few people live in the forests and hills of the northern plateaus, the region called Voskald ("homeland of the people of the cold"; often referred to as North Vostok or North Vosland in Sembara). Much more than the people of Voslaag, the Voskalders are closely connected by culture and shared history with the [[Zimkova]], especially the traditionalists in the north.


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah so this is the basic inland / coastal distinction


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
I think that is good to keep as canon


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
But that doesn't mean the northern vostok are just one group


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but there might be multiple distinct cultural groups within each category


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
right


[7/13/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
for the coastal people, the Voslaag, I think there are reasonably a Skaer-influenced and a Skaer-independent group, but that might not involve different languages


[7/13/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
for now I don't think this needs to be developed too much beyond what is in the Vostok doc


[7/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
Right so from a linguistic standpoint, there are three ways to write this:

(a) just leave Vosic out of the languages doc entirely, i.e. put some notes in %% %%but don't publish it for my players. They won't care
(b) canonically define at least 2 Vos languages (Southern Vosic and Northern Vosic perhaps with better names) Souther = Eastros, Northern = Nrothros
(c) defined Vosic as "a collection of languages spoken in the Vostok region with a range of influences"


[7/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
with a note that we might decide to split it


[7/13/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd probably just leave one Vosic language, with the note that this might not be all there is, and without much detail


[7/13/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so basically option (c)


[7/13/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
right ok.


[7/13/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
so we are about to go get lunch but what I'm going to try to write up this afternoon or evening is

(a) an upate to the language doc that covers this stuff.  
Summary:
1. Add Old Tollish/Tollish/Old Zimka/New Zimka/Tyrwinghan as discssed here
2. Make Sembaran a creole/not same as Drankorian as discussed here
3. Vague-ify Vosic and move it to the Miscellaneous languages section
4. Move most exotic and extra planer to separate page to allow for vagueness

(b) an update my  Synthesis of Humanity in Greater Sembara doc in background
1. Introduces and clarifies the key idea here of Zimka/Tollish/Skaer and the evolution
2. Mentions the problem of Vostok and some of the non-canonical ideas here


[7/13/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I'll push both and tag status/tim. My goal is to publish the language doc for Kiya at least (she wants details on what languages and alphabets Celyn knows) by the end of the weekend or early next week

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/13/2024 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
Final language page per the above is pushed


[7/14/2024 7:56 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have any specific thoughts about writing systems? Kiya and I were talking a bit about what Sylvan writing is actually like


[7/14/2024 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a feeling, although not certain, that the first writing was done by the titans, dragons, archfey, and primordial elementals. The elder folk adopted it. So my guess would be sylvan -> elven, giant -> stoneborn, dwarven. Halflings probably developed writing late as their ‚Äúnative magic‚Äù is not written, and probably adopted an alphabet from somewhere.


[7/14/2024 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
So it might be that elvish and sylvan share an alphabet. But open to other ideas


[7/14/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
That was my exact thought as well


[7/14/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
Not the share an alphabet necessarily but that writing originated with the fey and titans


[7/14/2024 8:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah


[7/14/2024 8:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Well, dragons also but they probably didn‚Äôt pass on writing in the same way. Draconic writing is probably inherently magical


[7/14/2024 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
I also kinda think that humans on Hkar created (or were given) their own writing system, not derived from the titan or fey line


[7/14/2024 8:34 PM] .deciusmus
So from that (and a bit of reading about human writing systems and some ideas from Kiya) I was thinking something like...

The original titans developed a runic system that embodied their crafting and creation. The key thing about runic systems is that (at least, some people theorize) letters also stand in for words. Which seems very appropriate for titans -> dwarves -> stoneborn


[7/14/2024 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
The fey similarly developed a writing system, but I have this sense it is very complex. Perhaps logographic with many characters, and perhaps complex in some other way (the characters have different meanings depending on some notion of time/place?).

The elves then were taught this fey system by Elmerca, but simplified it substantially for their own use, effectively evolving it into a proper alphabet


[7/14/2024 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
The humans on Hkar then developed their own system, which evolved into a couple of different lineages, in the same way the Phonecian alphabet became Greek + Latin + Cyrllic.

These lineages become the Northros/Drankorian/Eastros alphabets which are the main "known" human alphabets (although perhaps the original northern alphabet is lost or was changed in some way or replacd by Drankorian in many cases)


[7/15/2024 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
About to go to a meeting but a morning thought: before settling too strongly on writing systems and alphabets, it might be worth thinking a bit about the role of magic. what language are scrolls and spellbooks "written" in, for example? 

In general though, I think that humans creating/receiving a "standard" alphabetic writing system along with the "Human" language (which becomes Common) on Hkar makes total sense, which then evolves into the modern day alphabets. I think roughly the time depth is right to have everything as closely related as Greek-derived alphabets (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, maybe some runic alphabets like Furthak). But no Arabic/Hebrew style alphabets where vowels are not letters, for example, which are an older divergence.

Might think a bit more later today when meetings are over a little more about "original Fey", "original Titan", and "original Draconic" which woudl be the three main "magic alphabets" in a sense. Elementals feel different, and the "outer planes" languages (celestial, infernal, etc) I think should be radically different.


[7/15/2024 9:37 AM] .deciusmus
I was also thinking a bit about the "why". Why do fey or titans or dragons develop a written language at all?


[7/15/2024 9:37 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not totally convinced, for example, that dragons bother to develop a specific mechanism designed to encode their draconic thoughts on paper. Is draconic writing really a language at all?


[7/15/2024 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
Or is it say, a way of encoding magic? Did/do dragons create monuments with their names on them, in their own language?


[7/15/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
These questions don't specifically need answers for dragons, as my only real goal is to figure out what fey writing is like


[7/15/2024 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
But the same questions apply to titans and fey. Do titans write letters to each other? It feels to me like in the age of myth, probably not. Is anyone thinking about recording "events" for the "future" when time itself is not stable?


[7/15/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
my assumption is this has to do with magic. the original titan language is rune magic, for example. i guess draconic is probably in some sense the language of arcane magic


[7/15/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the fey, though, are probably doing things like writing stories. writing in the mythic age doesn't develop for normal human reasons, since the fey don't care about tracking grain harvests and writing memorials on tombs or decrees and edicts


[7/15/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
but, they are probably writing novels


[7/15/2024 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
Right that all makes sense to me


[7/15/2024 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
But it suggests that the draconic language might not have any direct relationship to human alphabets or even to a further mechanism dragons might develop to say write orders to kobolds in draconic


[7/15/2024 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea that fey writing originally developed to write stories, plays, poems, etc


[7/15/2024 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus
i was actually contemplating making draconic in some form, or at least the draconic alphabet, the language of spellbooks. or maybe arcane spells in general. need to think a bit more


[7/15/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
no one has played a wizard for any length of time in Taelgar


[7/15/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Eric has fiddled a bit with Seeker being interested in giants because of the connection to dwarven runic magic, though


[7/15/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
Right, sure, I find that idea interesting and plausible but just not really related to why fey develop writing


[7/15/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/15/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I think there probably doesn't need to be a "Grand Unified Theory" of why the children of the divine developed writing


[7/15/2024 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
for the fey specifically, I would definitely say that in the age of myth, the archfey invented writing specifically as an art form.


[7/15/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
And so making something up about fey -> elvish doesn't necessarily have to have any impact on giants -> dwarves or dragons -> spellbooks


[7/15/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
this probably makes the sylvan script quite complicated. maybe like japanese in a sense, where you have simultaenously logographcs and a syllabary


[7/15/2024 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
Right, or Eygptian hieroglyphics.


[7/15/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
But also, I was trying to brainstorm ways the fey might have used it as an art form to make it feel a bit non-human...

For example, what is there was an element of fey writing that meant something different depending on the time of day (i.e. place in the feywild) you read it? So to properly interpret fey writing you need to know *where* it was supposed to be read


[7/15/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Or, some type of tonal indicator, a note or glyph representing a note, which provided an emotional overlay on the writing, which might change the meaning of words


[7/15/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
Or even some type of magical element, where it is hard to write properly without the correct magical sense, because there are some logograms that mean different things depending on the magic used to write them


[7/15/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
Kiya who has a hobbiest interest in ancient Egypt, was telling me about an aspect of hieroglpyhics that seemed interesting...

> The fun thing about hieroglyphics, by the way, is the determinatives, which are basically non-pronounced ideographic characters at the end of words to tell you what kind of word they are.  So, like, a motion-verb might end in [walking feet] so you know how to read it, or a name might end [figure of man], [figure of god], or [figure of dog] so you knew if someone was talking about a guy named Anup (Anubis), the god Anubis, or a dog named Anubis.
> If a determinative is specific enough sometimes it's just straight-up used as an ideogram.


[7/15/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think the "pure" form of sylvan writing would be very hard for humans to read, or really for non-fey to read. i think the emotional/tonal overlay is the right direction, where the meaning of a glyph changes depending on how the person who wrote it was feeling, and to properly understand it you have to read it in the feywild, where the emotional resonance of the glyph can be allowed to change your emotions as you read


[7/15/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
building on Kiya's point, proper "full sylvan" probably has magically encoded emotional determinatives


[7/15/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I like that


[7/15/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
but, that means you can't fully understand proper "high sylvan" or whatever outside the feywild, most likely


[7/15/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
there would also be something like "low sylvan" where the emotional determatives are written out


[7/15/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
(For in-game interest, I'd probably assume Detect Magic lets you sense them)


[7/15/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, that's a good idea


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
I was thinking why have low sylvan? When fey writing first developed, there was no "feywild" vs "material" plane and everyone could just understand the emotional determiniatives


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
well, sometimes the fey presumably need to write something that will pass out of the feywild


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Then, after the Riving, when the fey first thought it was useful to communicate with others, they just adopted elvish


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
ah, sure, okay, that might make more sense


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
which might be, after all, just a simplified form of sylvan anyway


[7/15/2024 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
More in a bit, have a meeting now


[7/15/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
I basically like the idea of somewhat modelling on ancient egyptian...

1) sylvan is a complex logo-syllabic script with 1000+ glyphs and emotional/magic determiniatives that make it hard to write, as well as a strong culture of "presentation" concerns (i.e. some fey would care how the written page physically looked, since it was developed for art anyway)
2) elvish evovled from sylvan in the same way demotic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)) evolved from hierglyphics

{Embed}
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)
Demotic (Egyptian)
Demotic (from Ancient Greek: Œ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ dƒìmotik√≥s, 'popular') is the ancient Egyptian script derived from northern forms of hieratic used in the Nile Delta. The term was first used by the Greek historian Herodotus to distinguish it from hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts. By convention, the word "Demotic" is capitalized in order to distinguish it ...

[7/15/2024 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that description of sylvan is basically in the right direction


[7/15/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the relationship between sylvan and elven scripts might require a bit more thought. i'm not sure it makes sense for elvish to have really a feeling of "evolved", if it was given to the elves by Elmerica. 

I kind of feel like one of two paths makes sense:
1) after the riving, a simplified fey script develops that is more of a syllabary and is somewhat easier for non-fey to read and write, and preserves meaning better across planes. this is never really a focal concern of the fey, and when it is picked up and formalized by the elves it basically just becomes elvish. 
2) after the riving, when the elves are created, Elmerica gives them language and writing, basically drawing from and simplifying Sylvan into a syllabary in the process


[7/15/2024 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
the distinction is maybe subtle, the difference would just be largely about whether elvish script and proper "full" sylvan are related by fey choices or by divine choices


[7/15/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I like the 2nd


[7/15/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
And to just expand, the fey then readopt the Elmerica-created writing system to use when they realize that the elves on the material plane can't really read what they are writing, due to lack of seeing the magic...

Although many elves can in fact natively detect magic, so perhaps it is more later, when the fey want to communicate with the non-elves, that this really starts to happen


[7/15/2024 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think the basic idea would be just that full sylvan script doesn't easily translate to the material plane. in the feywild, the determantives are obvious (if, sometimes, dangerous to read because they can put the unsuspecting reader into the mindset of the writer, which can theoretically mean a poem written by a powerful archfey might function like suggestion or charm person or other enchantment magic)


[7/15/2024 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
oh, I like that


[7/15/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but in the material plane, it requires special effort to read (maybe not just detect magic, but perhaps if you have the fey touched feat, or are a fey ranger subclass, or have an archfey patron, etc)


[7/15/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
(would still be dangerous to read on the material plane)


[7/15/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
right


[7/15/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
(if you can read it)


[7/15/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so when the fey want to write for more "standard" reasons - send letters to followers on the material plane, etc - they adopt the Elmerica-derived elvish script to write


[7/15/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
in part because the main people they are communicating with are elves


[7/15/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
but in part because the reason for writing changes


[7/15/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
right, I like that


[7/15/2024 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
i would probably lean into the magic aspect of the original sylvan alphabet, and make it very easy to read, like it wants to be understood, but very hard to write


[7/15/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
(Although I would also suppose that fey often actually just not only write to their follows in the elvish alphabet, but in the elvish - or drankorian - or tyrwinghan - language itself, right?)


[7/15/2024 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, right, just many of their first followers were elves


[7/15/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
mechanically, i might consider:
(1) anyone who knows sylvan knows how to speak sylvan, how to read/write sylvan using elvish script, and how to read sylvan using the sylvan script, but not how to write the sylvan script
(2) the slyvan script can, in theory, be used to write any language, and it always somehow 'makes sense' to readers who can read that language in its native alphabet


[7/15/2024 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a question of - do the fey usually know lots of other languages? Is some powerful fey writing an order to an elvish follower in sylvan, but in the elvish script? or are they just writing in elvish?


[7/15/2024 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
probably some of both, i think


[7/15/2024 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
The alternative idea I just had was that actually writing sylvan in other alphabets wasn't developed by the fey at all, but by fey-adjacent people (elves, tyrwinghans) as a way to try to communicate/understand/discuss sylvan


[7/15/2024 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
Especially if the sylvan script is magical and "Wants" to be read


[7/15/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
The fey just write in sylvan. Who cares after all? They can do it easily, and the elves and humans seem to be able to read it, and if some humans who read a fey love poem actually fall in love a little bit, well, good, that's the point of writing a love poem


[7/15/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
It's the humans/elves who start writing sylvan in other alphabets, to both be able to write it and to avoid the dangers of reading sylvan itself



[7/15/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
so, summarizing, here is my take:
- The fey invent the language Sylvan, and the corresponding complex logo-syllabic script, during the mythic age, primarily as an art form, used to write poetry, songs, and stories. The script itself encodes this concern: it uses magical/emotional determinatives to communicate the emotional state of the writer, which changes the meaning of glyphs and as a secondary effect has a magical enchantment effect that is weaker or stronger depending on the magical power of the writer
- When Elmerica creates the elves, they *(actually not entirely sure about the gender or lack thereof of the Elven firstborn) also give the elves language (Elvish), and a writing system (the Elvish script), that is derived from the Sylvan script, but converted to a syllabary and stripped of the magical determinatives. The reasons for using the Sylvan script, as opposed to just invented something out of thin air, are left undetermined for the moment, just matters that this is what happened. 
- Over time, as the fey begin to interact with other people (non-fey), a few changes happen. First, the fey decide that sometimes writing is useful for things other than art, and that sometimes the magical weight of the fey script is not actually desirable. Second, some non-fey learn the Sylvan tongue (especially, early on, elves), but do not know how, or are not able, to write in the Sylvan script. This leads to the rapid development of an orthography for expressing Sylvan in the Elvish script
- The fey also, around this time, start to learn other languages. Sometimes they just write in the other language's script, but they also rapidly adapt the Sylvan script to other spoken languages, and the magic of the enchantment generally carries the meaning well enough


[7/15/2024 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
this leads to the following modern day things:
- the Sylvan language, spoken by the fey, and written in either the (magical) sylvan script, or more typically in the Elvish script. most people who speak sylvan (or, anyway, most non-fey) cannot write in the sylvan script, but can read sylvan in both sylvan and elvish scripts, and write sylvan in elvish. The orthography of writing Sylvan in Elvish was largely invented by the elves as a way to write Sylvan, but functionally adopted by many fey, and probably involved some back and forth and probably is not totally standardized (e.g., like medieval english spelling), but for game-mechanical purposes this is probably irrelevant.
- the Sylvan script, originally used for writing the Sylvan language but since adapted to many other languages, which carries emotive weight, potential magic, and wants to be read so is usually understandable to speakers of the language
- the Elvish script, which is derived via Elmerica's intervention from the Sylvan script, was originally used to write Elvish, but is also the typical script that non-fey use to write Sylvan


[7/15/2024 1:26 PM] rsulfuratus
left undecided / open to feedback:
- is there an orthography of writing/reading sylvan in other scripts, that is does somewho who knows Sylvan automatically also know the Elvish script, or would they typically write Sylvan transliterated to e.g. Drankorian or Eastros alphabets? I'm fairly open either way to this. There are plenty of examples of real-world languages written in multiple scripts so totally plausible either way. I think the fey would never use anything other than Sylvan or Elvish scripts for written communication among themselves, though. However, a fey who wanted to write a message to a Tyrwinghan human could plausibly write Sylvan (in Sylvan, or Elvish, or Drankorian script, depending on their goals); write in Tyrwinghan or Common or Sembaran, using the standard alphabet; or write in Tyrwinghan/Common/Sembaran in Sylvan, if the magic was the goal
- mechanically, what does the language "Sylvan" imply. this would obviously depend on the game, but I would typically assume either: (a) speak Sylvan, write and read Sylvan with Elvish script; (b) speak Sylvan, write/read Sylvan with orthography of native language. But generally taking the language proficiency "Sylvan" should not generally give special ability to write Sylvan scripts.

A few quick comments, leaving aside the game mechanical for a moment.

I'm not totally sold on "you can write any language with the Sylvan script" and have it be understood. I'm more wondering if it should be something like: "the fey learned to add their emotional/magical determinatives to other orthographies".

Alternatively, it seems like it would be plausible to say that sylvan isn't really a specific set of glyphs at all, but something more magical than that, and its connection to a specific language kinda vague


[7/15/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
It seems weird to me to think that say the character:

[7/15/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
Which implies that you don't need any special magic or anything to read sylvan writing. (although if you don't know the sylvan language, the fey would have to have been writing in your language)


[7/15/2024 1:36 PM] .deciusmus
but of course you should probably also be *cautious* about reading fey writing


[7/15/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
It's *writing* slyvan that is quite the trick for a non-fey to learn


[7/15/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is a little more complicated. I guess what I was going for with the ‚Äúwant to be read‚Äù is two-fold. One, I think that it is probably relatively obvious visually when you are looking at ‚Äúget writing‚Äù. Maybe a powerful archfey can disguise it, but you don‚Äôt typically pick up a random poem and then realize only after reading it that you are now charmed.


[7/15/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
Second, the fey script gives a lot of power to the writer. A fey missive can make itself subtly easier or harder to understand as the writer desires


[7/15/2024 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
So maybe it isn‚Äôt exactly that the Sylvan script is used to write other languages, but it is also not exactly the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù script, both visually and practically


[7/15/2024 1:40 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Agree with that as well. I actually think there are probably two different things going on here....

1) Fey writing, as a thing, is just somewhat magical, whatever language they are writing in, if they want it to be. So a fey can of course write a perfectly normal letter in Tyrwinghan. But they also can "embellish" it in some way, which would with some powerful/rare exceptions be obvious, which would give it an emotional power/magical spin


[7/15/2024 1:41 PM] .deciusmus
2) The writing system for Sylvan, that the fey created in the age of myth, is so intertwined with the idea of magical fey writing that it can't be understood without the embellishments


[7/15/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
So it goes something like....

The fey develop this magical form of written communication, where there are embedded emotions in the words, and their written language never disambiguates between certain concepts without the embedded emotion

Over time, you get:
a) a non-magical and simplified version of the fey writing (Elvish) which just represents phonemes/syllables like normal writing systems
b) fey learning to use their writing tricks on other languages


[7/15/2024 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
Which is, I think, kinda what you were saying as well?


[7/15/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I think that‚Äôs perfect


[7/15/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
One idea from Kiya.... True fey writing in Sylvan might be non-linear, i.e. the central concept of a poem might be inscribed large and in the middle, and additional words and context in concentric circles around it


[7/15/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
Which might then in turn lead to Tyrwinghan art sometimes replicating the appearance of fey writing, without the magic


[7/15/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that


[7/15/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a few comments / edits / idea on the language doc, btw, it might be simpler to just post thoughts in Discord but could also add comments and push if you prefer the tracking aspect

either


[7/15/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
Re: "_Real world analog_: Undefined. Very few names or place names would be written in Common." I have tended to somewhat arbitrarily "translate" place names into effectively Common, to give a few familar anchors for things. The two examples that come to mind immediately are "Raven's Hold" and "Copper Hills", but also e.g. Green Sea, Endless Ocean, Sea of Storms, Sentinels. I think it is actually nice to sprinkle these in occasionally for practical and flavor reasons, especially if they have other, language-specific names (e.g., Labkah, Inalas for Sentinels)


[7/15/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think this needs to be explicitly called out especially in a player facing language doc


[7/15/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
But my headcannon for why I don't bother making "native" names for everything is this is the Common translation


[7/15/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[7/15/2024 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I might make a note to this effect in the language doc as that will be the primary reference for practical naming of things


[7/15/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
_Real world analog_: Modern English. Place or personal names written out (i.e. [[Copper Hills]] or [[Sentinel Range]] or [[Copperharps]] or [[Gemcrafters]]) should usually be read as being Common, in world.


[7/15/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
re: "_Alphabet_: Drankorian is written using the Drankorian alphabet". I'm not positive actually that there is a good reason for the Drankorian alphabet and the pre-Downfall urban Hkaran alphabet to be different. Maybe this doesn't really matter so much in practice, but there is a very close culturally continuity here that is maybe not precisely reflected in the documents. From the Drankorian point of view, of course, this is Drankorian, and especially from a present-day view


[7/15/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
I was inclined to preserve the possibility of old and mysterious Hkaran writing


[7/15/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but, I think that would be older


[7/15/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not positive...


[7/15/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
maybe a %% note %% indicating something like:

On the Drankorian language family, I'm not fully convinced that Sembaran should be thought of as a creole. I would actually potentially put Sembaran in the Eastros family, and have Sembaran and Tollish share a grammar but use vocabulary that is almost entirely derived from Drankorian. So they are kind of understandable if you concentrate to Isinguese or Cymeans, but like all the sentences might be backwards or something


[7/15/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
but they would not really be understandable to Skaer or others as the vocabulary is quite different


[7/15/2024 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
That works for me


[7/15/2024 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
like if 85% of the words in English were French loan words


[7/15/2024 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, exactly


[7/15/2024 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I like that a lot actually


[7/15/2024 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this fits with the history of the Mostreve hills being a long-standing political divide (e.g. even at its largest immediately pre-Great War Sembara never claimed kingship over Isingue) and establishes the Insiguese refugee community as a little bit more distinct, as they likely have a non-mutually-intelligible language as well as a sharped cultural break


[7/15/2024 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
if you agree I'm going to modify the language doc to fit this


[7/15/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
and it explains why I have such a random mix of French + English names, but with a lot more French along the southern borders

my other thoughts are a little more vague. currently none of the northros languages use a "northros script"


[7/15/2024 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus

[7/15/2024 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I didn't like the northros alphabets


[7/15/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
that should probably change


[7/15/2024 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i was going to suggest for northros, we could lean into it and argue that the original northros language was generally not written, which might push back the date of the first human migrations quite far into early Hkar (but, not necessarily a bad thing, given the quite distinct religious traditions) and would imply a few things about early hkar (e.g., lack of widespread literacy, since there is a writing system in place at the creation of humans - but if the ancestors of the northerners were largely illiterate it could work)

alternatively, i think that at least Deno'qai and Old Zimkovian should probably share an alphabet. Mawar probably adopts Drankorian writing as it is fairly culturally distinct from the northern folk religion cultures


[7/15/2024 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
don't have strong feelings either way, could leave that undetermined for now. there is nothing particularly canonically decided about Deno'qai writing systems


[7/15/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
a few more random thoughts:
- I think potentially Chardonian has overtaken Drankorian as a scholarly language these days, and probably fewer and fewer scholars of the past two generations bother to learn Drankorian. It would not be quite as unusual as, say, learning Latin or Greek today in the real world, but it isn't anything like the prevalence of Latin in the Middle Ages. I think especially Mos Numena, without a real hierarchy or organization, is typically propogated in the local languages, and so there isn't a strong religious force to maintain a non-spoken language


[7/15/2024 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
(pre Great War there is some impetus to maintain Drankorian as a kind of diplomatic language among the disparate city states of the west coast, but post Great War Chardonian becomes dominant)


[7/15/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
- it is a bit weird to have Old Zimkovan as a Northros language and Zimkovan as an Eastros language, primarily from a naming point of view. shouldn't it be called something else, by analogy to e.g. Old English vs Brittonic?


[7/15/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
On Old Zimkovan vs Zimkovan: yes, definitely

I was also planning on renaming most of the kestavo names to be more Arabic/Maltese sounding, the vibe being basically that the Zimka people, speaking an Eastros language, effectively reclaimed the cultural inheritance from the ~OldZimkovan~


[7/15/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus

[7/15/2024 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
Sorta like if the Welsh & AngloSaxons had never converted to Christianity, and then during the Norman Conquest, lots and lots of Anglo-Saxons ended up in Wales where they then consciously reidentified themselves with the "British"


[7/15/2024 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
in opposition to the "French"


[7/15/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
You might end up with a Wales speaking mostly English and an England speaking mostly French where the differences between Britons+English kinda fades away


[7/15/2024 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
putting Sembaran and Tollish in Eastros works really well, it gives the Drankorian languages (diverging for ~700 years) a much simpler structure with only four languages, more or less (perhaps plus 1-2 more on the west coast), while the Eastros family (diverging for 2000+ years) has a lot more complexity
