otally different topic... but I was just messing around with the pre-Downfall situation, and it would actually work pretty well to have all of the major "Firstborn" races have massive civilizations that met at Ulrich Pass
You'd extend the western gulf up along the sembaran rivers (making Embry, with its pre-downfall origin, originally a coastal city)

Huh. I like that actually
Deciusmus — Today at 9:21 PM
Something like this:
Image
light blue is green sea
green is the big swamp
yellow is elf
dark blue circle is dwarf
it all converges on Ulrich
the 4 grey circles are marniner settlements (well, one is tyrwinghan which might or might not be mariner)
the brown is northerner
rsulfuratus — Today at 9:32 PM
i might tweak a few details but i like the basic idea
it sets tyrwingha up as pretty unusual in some respects, which probably makes sense
Deciusmus — Today at 9:34 PM
here's a slight different version - brown = human, yellow = elf, green = lizardfolk, blue = dwarf, light blue = green sea:
![[Pasted image 20250121221327.png]]
not really committed to the specific details, but the idea would be:

(a) pretty much all of the core lands that will become drankorian heartland have no humans at the time Drankor expands into the lands. 
(b) Tyrwingha is odd
(c) Embry was founded as a coastal city
(d) the northern Cymeans were mariner and there might be a bit of a cultural divide between north, central, and south cymea
it also sets up south Cymea in particular as being the most purely drankorian-successor state around, as the west coast had all these scattered humans as did the east
rsulfuratus — Today at 9:40 PM
so, a few things
(1) definitely more-or-less canon that the initial expansion up the istaros and across dunmar is into empty land. likely there is actually a degree of "drankorian + peronar magic restores the land that was devasted by the downfall", echoing perhaps a bit the "jeevali restores the land" although want to avoid that being a total cliche
but in any case, the initial expansion - when an island dumps a few million or more people at the mouth of this river - is not war or even assimilation
(2) i have a pretty clear - if vague - vision of cymea, and the main fault line is really northeast vs northwest vs south (will draw a map in a sec)
(3) embry as a coastal city on founding is interesting, but pratically wouldn't it then suffer a lot? i might what are the odds the waters recede exactly to leave it as a river port after the downfall
i'm sure there is a way to square that circle but it feels a little too pat to me
Deciusmus — Today at 9:47 PM
it does feel that without some degree of magic of divine intervention, it is a little pat
rsulfuratus — Today at 9:48 PM
re: cymea
![[Pasted image 20250121221342.png]]
this is super rough
Deciusmus — Today at 9:48 PM
yeah but that actually lines up perfectly with my map
my brown circle of "old mariner" culture lines up with your green circle
(because we both drew it based on thehills, basically)
rsulfuratus — Today at 9:50 PM
right, okay, i guess i just think of both green + red as 'north cymea" but yeah the maps line up
Deciusmus — Today at 9:50 PM
right, yeah, I said it badly
I mean, I was thinking something more like:
![[Pasted image 20250121221353.png]]
but I don't have any particlarly clear thoughts
I mean, I like your view, not saying I am suggesting changing it or anything
just saying when I said "north" / "central" / "south" that is what I was thinking
either way, I wasn't really planning on commiting to anything in particular here
The main idea is that there were no meaningful human cultures in the red circle:
![[Pasted image 20250121221408.png]]
when drankorians land
rsulfuratus — Today at 9:55 PM
right - although also remember a good chunk of the land west of the yuvanti mountains is ocean at this point, and the mountains don't exist
Deciusmus — Today at 9:55 PM
well, yeah
rsulfuratus — Today at 9:56 PM
(that will be an interesting story when you finally figure out what actually happened when cha'mutte died)
Deciusmus — Today at 9:56 PM
is that the end of the campaign big reveal
?
rsulfuratus — Today at 9:56 PM
not saying
might be the destruction of the crown level 20 one shot
going back to cymea - i think that actually sets up the mysterious south cymea as actually perhaps the best "byzantine equivalent" post-drankor survival of empire
Deciusmus — Today at 9:59 PM
yeah
here is the map I've playing with:
![[Pasted image 20250121221424.png]]
which is agnostic as to where the non-human empires were
but

black circles are northern
blue circles are mariner or mixed marnier/northern
green is dunmari although canonically unplaced as long as it is outside the red circle
red is "no one"
blue question markers as "unknown but probably marnier" if anyone
black question marks are who knows
missing a couple of black circles for the northern migrationthat is well established
tywinghan is misdrawn as blue

the other spot that has always been a bit of trouble is the yeraad river valley, which is notably blank on this map
Deciusmus — Today at 10:03 PM
Right. It is the first people drankor would encounter going west, but who is there? well-established northerners? no one? lizardfolk? an ancient curse? Illorians? the weird people who end up in the apporian highlands after being driven out by drankor?
although actually probably the illorians are the first people they encountered
given the idea of darba as a fort - although maybe that is a fort against the giants or whatever, not humans at all
I'm not sure it matters what was in the Yeraad River Valley pre-Drankor. The western expansion is already established as being fairly conquest/brutual compared to eastern expansion. So it is easy enough to say that from the perspective of modern day Yeraad, Drankor wiped the slate clean
rsulfuratus — Today at 10:06 PM
that's true
Deciusmus — Today at 10:06 PM
That preserves the possibility that it was a dragon or giants or an undead kingdom or something. maybe the western expansion was brutual because of whatever was in the yeraad river valley
rsulfuratus — Today at 10:06 PM
i think the darba fort is against ~ something dangerous ~ in the Nevos Sea area, not humans. this is in 377, more than 200 years before the western conquest begins
Deciusmus — Today at 10:07 PM
Right. Could also be Illorians potentially
Maybe the Illorians were a second group of refugees from a rival school of magical thought or something
or an anti-magical school of thought
I mean, not saying any of this is necessarily true or good, just saying, it could be anything
rsulfuratus — Today at 10:08 PM
sure, maybe. it probably doesn't matter too much until someone sets a campaign in illoria / apporia
i think the main thing is this is not a fort established in support of the advancing army, darba is originally a defensive position, and naval focused (the fact that it is the one good dunmari harbor is basically because the harbor isn't dunmari)
(although it might not be dunmari any more depending on how the negotiations with karnas and chardon turn out)
Deciusmus — Today at 10:10 PM
Right. From the perspective of the historical framework, all that matters is

(a) the western frontier is along the Darba/Myrani Gap line and it stays that way for a while
(b) when it changes, it changes fast and
(c) from the perspective of post-Drankorian history, whatever was in the Mryani/Yeerad area is gone enough that it doesn't meaningfully impact post-Drankorian development
rsulfuratus — Today at 10:11 PM
yes
Deciusmus — Today at 10:11 PM
Or if it does, it is via a small, localized thing, not a major cultural factor
irsulfuratus — Today at 10:11 PM
in the modern day, all i know about this place is the border area is rough and dangerous and notorious for kobold banditry
so maybe it was kobolds all along
(i added the divine power chat to obsidian but not any of this history stuff)
