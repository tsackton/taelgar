A couple of random topics.

**Highland Kingdoms**
 I've been thinking a bit about the highland kingdoms as I was cleaning up the Sembaran regnal lines. I have some game reasons to want them to be more fleshed out, so probably making up some stuff there is going to be my next project.

I don't think there is much we've defined anywhere about them right?

My immediate goal is to come up with a better name - I think the entire greater Sembaran region needs a name and then the highland kingdoms can be "the whatever name highlands" (to distinguish from whatevername lowlands, which is Sembara + Tyrwingha + Maseau + Addermarch)


[11/21/2023 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
Etymology is, I think, the ancient mariner word for "land of many rivers"


[11/21/2023 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, the "lowlands" region ends up acquiring some Drankorian-derived name for whatever Drankor called the provinces and the ancient marnier word comes to mean just the highland section (which is the only bit not conqueored by Drankor)


[11/21/2023 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
there isn't much defined about them, perhaps a bit in the old human migrations docs. they are supposed to be the "north/east" culture that is a mix of the northerners and mariners, basically adopt the northerner gods and the mariner language


[11/21/2023 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
language-wise  Sembara is French/English (with French more to the south and especially the old Isingue language) and Tyrwingha is Welsh/Celtic


[11/21/2023 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
but never really been clear if the highland kingdoms are closer culturally/linguistically to tyrwinghan or vostok/skaerhem


[11/21/2023 1:40 PM] .deciusmus
I think probably Vostok


[11/21/2023 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
so that puts them scandanavian/icelandic/finnish/russian, which is a linguistically odd mix but I think captures the kind of weird linguistic currents of that region


[11/21/2023 1:42 PM] .deciusmus
The current kingdom names are more slavic derived (Zovka, Lavnoch) as are the kestavo names (Kamak, Vacla)


[11/21/2023 1:42 PM] .deciusmus
Tyrwingha is actually another odd blank spot that I should probably think about given the centrality of Tyrwinghan fey to the backgrounds of 2 of my PCs


[11/21/2023 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
In my language doc I have the Skaer/Vos language use the Eastros alphabet


[11/21/2023 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I am going to push my language notes to background in notes that has all the real world mappings that I've used

[11/21/2023 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
I think it actually makes sense for the highland kingdoms to be fairly culturally distinct from lowland "greater sembara"


[11/21/2023 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
Tyrwingha + Sembara + Insingue/Maseau/Addermarch have ~1000 years of shared rule under the Drankorians to culturally align


[11/21/2023 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
whereas the highland kingdoms are - at least per the current history - never conqueored



[1/17/2024 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
I am taking a little break from work to do some taelgar stuff during lunch, I have been thinking about the highland kingdoms and trying to write something up. 

Do you have any sense about how far east into Vostok the ‚Äúhighland culture‚Äù goes? Or about what the northern Vos are like?


[1/17/2024 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yes I do have a sense of this. in a meeting now though


[1/17/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so basic outline - open to revision
- northerners cross mountains pre-downfall, up north, kind of around where blackwater fens is now, into the plains that are now kenku homeland
- they slowly spread out, trickling across the forests of inland sembara, vos, and further east, basically sticking to the forests/highlands
- in the coasts/lowlands/river valleys mix with mariners, creating a variety of cultures (lowland sembara, tyrwingha, skaer)
- lowland cultures (minus skaer) are more influenced by drankor than highland cultures
- so this gives you basically a band spreading all the way from sentinels to some unknown point east of "northerner" culture, with some variations
- my main feeling is that three primary events drive variation among the northerners

1. initial spread: there is likely some variation in the initial spread, with different groups and traditions creating an initial baseline level of differentiation. mostly, i think the people who made it past the Sivnjo mountains are from a related but distinct cultural tradition that the people of Sembara/Vos

2. mariner interactions: the sembaran highlanders don't interact with mariners as much as the Vos

3. skaer interactions: the skaer have considerable influence in two time periods, first in the time after the downfall when the skaer are dominant in the western gulf and conquer tollen/establish an empire; second in the early sembaran period when skaer raid frequently on the coasts


[1/17/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in the current day this leads to:
- sembaran highland culture that stretches to the "lakes region" of eastern inland vos, largely uninfluenced by anyone 
- a lowlander vos culture with strong "northern" and "skaer" and "drankorian" influences, may be a mix of kestavo and mos numena, for example, but mostly restricted along the coasts, from say the volta east
- an "interior" vos culture, which was greatly influenced by the skaer empire when the skaer would raid/sail/conquer up the rivers, but probably shares a religion with highlanders (e.g. are kestavan)
- might also be room for others, e.g. the lowland vos may be geographically split between kestavan and mos numean traditions; the "wall culture" could be something yet again separate; an interior vos culture that largely fled the skaer expansion and has a more mariner offshoot but inland vibe (perhaps analogous a bit to britons vs anglo-saxons)


[1/17/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
but to answer your specific question, the highlander culture probably spreads into northeastern vostok in particular in the area around the lakes, but not much further


[1/17/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
Here's a rough map I drew:

Red = "Zimka" northern culture
Green = "mariner"
Blue = "Vos" northern culture (to the extent it is different from Zimka, could be the same)
Yellow = Lizardfolk swamp

[1/17/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
Undetermined is how humans got to Tyrwinha, map is not meant to implement it was lizardfolk


[1/17/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
i think when people settle, the vos and zimka cultures are not really distinct, and probably spread all the way south across mostreve hills and into tyrwingha


[1/17/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
this is pre-downfall, pre-mariner


[1/17/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
I thought we had a giant lizardfolk swamp ?


[1/17/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
sure but it doesn't reach all the way to the sentinels


[1/17/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
covers basically of the sembaran lowlands


[1/17/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
and tyrwingha


[1/17/2024 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway the point isn't about tyrwingha


[1/17/2024 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
point is that i think at the initial migration of northern cultures from the east over the mountains, you really get two (for now) cultural strands


[1/17/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
So maybe more like this (pre-mariner)

[1/17/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
basically the logic being three variants of "northern folk religions" feels like a good initial number


[1/17/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
blue = "vos"
red = "zimka"
yellow = lizardfolk
green = elves


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
swamp goes further north, as far as the volta at least


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
actually had the idea at one point that the western gulf didn't even exist pre-downfall, or was much smaller


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
tbd when you go explore the canyon with the portal to the plane of water down there


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
Doesn't Tollen predate the downfall? I think the swamp probably goes to the Teft


[1/17/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus

[1/17/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure, maybe not quite to the volta


[1/17/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
but the details don't really matter


[1/17/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah anyway my point is you don't really have two distinct cultures that show up in vos/zimka


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
there is the zimka vs "east of Sivnjo" distinction where there might be different variants of the northern folk religions


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but the whole interior highlands are kestavan


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
ah, I see. So you want the blue and red to be the same


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
that makes sense


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
at this point in history yes


[1/17/2024 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
then distinctions really arise from interactions with mariners, drankor, and skaer


[1/17/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
then you have something like this (fuschia = mariner culture)

[1/17/2024 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah the details of the history can be a little fuzzy but the idea is you have the zimka who basically remain pretty isolated and self-contained throughout their history, and then vos being a bit more of a mixing ground


[1/17/2024 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
then you end up with something broadly like this:

[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
where fuschia - zimka, more isolated, esp by drankor (red)


[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
green - skaer


[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
blue = what becomes vos


[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
vos ends up with at least three dominant cultures, although room for more


[1/17/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
a lowland vos culture that is dominant in the lower river valleys and coast that might even be mos numenan (tbd)


[1/17/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
a highland vos culture that is dominant in the northeast of the country that is mariner influenced and skaer influenced but less drankor


[1/17/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
the zimka culture in the volta headwaters and east across the "lakes region"


[1/17/2024 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but I don't know that the Zimka culture is "part of Vostok"


[1/17/2024 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Vostok is kind of an artfact of drankorian mapmakers and sembaran nationalists, though


[1/17/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
like, maybe isn't a real place from the point of view of the vos


[1/17/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
The reason for all this is to better establish the "highland" kingdoms -- and I'm leaning toward the idea that there are three actual kingdoms (Ardlas, Lavnoch, Breva) and then northern Zimkovia or Zimkovia or whatever it is called, which stretches in most of the fuschia region


[1/17/2024 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think the idea is drankor draws a line along the volta and calls everything beyond it the land of the vos, not particularly caring that this creates a line right through "zimka" territory


[1/17/2024 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
when Derik III claims overlordship of Vostok during the wars against Vimfrost, perhaps this is kind of a polite legal fiction in a sense, and it is largely the lowland vos who actually acknowledge his rule in some vague sense. but the people who are actually getting slaughtered by the dragon's armies aren't about to turn down help


[1/17/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
from the point of view of the Vos, the lines would be drawn differently perhaps


[1/17/2024 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
I just don't entirely envision the Zimka (or the Vos) has having borders on a map and clear political units. Like, there is no particular "kingdom" of Zimkovia that anyone could conqueor and the people wouldn't really have the sense of a common nation


[1/17/2024 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah exactly


[1/17/2024 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
vostok is the same way, it is just the part of the world that drankorian mapmakers labeled "the land of the Vos"


[1/17/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus

[1/17/2024 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
Basically the pink is the area that is populated by the Zimka people (whereas the red are various Zimka-adajenct kingdoms that might speak the Zimka language but are in fact organized in some type of reconigizable political units)


[1/17/2024 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
people in Sembara would call those the Highland Kingdoms or the Zimka Realms or whatever. Zimkovia is the name for the pink area = the land of the Zimka


[1/17/2024 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
the exact borders with Vostok fuzzy


[1/17/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
where Vostok, like Zimkovia, is a Drankorian fiction, not a real "kingdom"


[1/17/2024 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I prefer Zimkova, instead of Zimkovia, if you don't care too much. Zimkovia sounds too much like Sokovia from the marvel movies to me


[1/17/2024 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
I am happy with either


[1/17/2024 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
One of the things I don't like is the current history of how the Zimka realms joined and then left Sembara - as per our earlier conversation, I think conquest for the typical human conquest reasons doesn't seem quite right.


[1/17/2024 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
Also the history I wrote a while ago has Derik III never being king of Zimkova, which I think is probably wrong here as well. I think he is in his person High King of Vostok and Zimkova, but his heirs don't maintain that for various reasons, most likely because it was basically always a legal fiction, embodied in Derik III's personal leadership, and the heirs are basically embarassed to claim the title when clearly they are never going to go to those places


[1/17/2024 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
I gotta go back to work for a bit but I might take a stab at rewriting some of the history later. I'll push it in a branch or brainstorming document or something


[1/17/2024 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
do you have names for this river or this lake?

[1/17/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
these are my western cymea names:
Some rough details for local features:

**Vistalba** (Veess-tahl-bah) - the largest town in this area, a trading port with a decent harbor, once much richer; now has a kind of run-down, lost in the past feeling. harbor dates to Drankorian days, though. once a major port through with Cymea wine, silver, and other goods passed. 

**Castelluccio** (Cah-steh-loo-cho) - one of several small villages inland along the Serrania, scraping by on agriculture

**Vallegra** (Vah-yeh-grah) - another agricultural village

**Redes** (Reh-des) - a small fishing village on the coast, just south of Lunacosta

**Lunacosta** (Loo-nah-koh-stah) - a market town on the coast at the mouth of the Serrania River

==

**Plataca Hills** (*PLAH-tah-kah*) - the hills that begin as low foothills about 40 miles from the western gulf, and rise to a significant barrier to travel

**Serran√≠a River** *(Seh-rrah-nee-ah)* - the rushing, rocky river that flows from the Plataca Hills to the Western Gulf. Only the first 10 miles or so are easily navigable.


[1/17/2024 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
have not put any into main docs yet, on my list

I reorganized the taelgarverse css, btw. there are a few bugs i haven't figured out yet but once i sort it out i'll push. there are:
- leaflet.css for things needed for the maps
- taelgarverse.css for grids and margins
- homepage.css for home page banner classes
- styling.css which has all the color elements

plus
- home.html which is the template for the home page
- toc.html which adds backlinks


[1/17/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea being if you just want to change colors you can just edit styling.css; if you want to change the homepage layout you need to mess with homepage.css and/or the home.html template; and you shouldn't ever need to change talegarverse or leaflet except to add new stuff

pushing a new website build to make sure it actually works but locally it seems fine.


[1/17/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
all color settings are in styling.css; note that this assumes you've set color themes for light and dark mode in mkdocs.yml, and that you are using slate as the dark mode color theme.


[1/17/2024 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
the order of stylesheets in the mkdocs.yml matters - check my taelgarverse repo for how i have it set up

My main idea is the Zimka are influenced by Pictish/Rus ideas about kingship (see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanistry or https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota_system)

Tanistry
Tanistry is a Gaelic system for passing on titles and lands.  In this system the Tanist (Irish: T√°naiste; Scottish Gaelic: T√†naiste; Manx: Tanishtey) is the office of heir-apparent, or second-in-command, among the (royal) Gaelic patrilineal dynasties of Ireland, Scotland and Mann, to succeed to the chieftainship or to the kingship.
