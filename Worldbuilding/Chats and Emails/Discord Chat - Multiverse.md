have not got very far due to actual work, but throwing out this thought for comment, will likely pick up some more on this later today.

i think that the extraplanar geography needs a bit of rearranging. 

energy realms make total sense and I like the traditional D&D 5e Elemental Planes. The ethereal plane and the plane of magic connect nicely here. 

echo realms make total sense as well, although the shadowfell might need a little bit of thought. it isn't obvious that fey need two planes, and it is a natural locus for undead, so might make more sense as an undead plane in a sense, but need to think about that in the context of the metaphysics of death. 

however i'm increasingly feeling like the outer planes don't really work. there are canonically as many as perhaps four categories of "outer planes":
(1) the realms of the embodied gods, of which the dwarven Heart of the Mountain is the most well established
(2) the realms of incorporeal gods, of which [[Shakun's Realm]] is the clearest, but which also canonically are not always a separate realm for each deity, e.g. Arkaash is supposed to be the realm of the Dunmari Pantehon
(3) what I've called the "primal realms": Arborea, the Abyss, Pandemonium, others. These are explicity not associated with deities, or at least not with the Divine Presence (but e.g. Pandemonium might be associated with Jinnik)
(4) the [[Dreamworld]], the Land of the Dead, the [[Plane of Souls]] don't fit obviously into this, although it is canonically established that you can reach the [[Dreamworld]] via the [[Plane of Souls]], and the Land of the Dead is a "dividing line" somehow for divine power
(5) the Astral Plane, which might not even exist? Or might be connected to the [[Plane of Souls]] and/or the Dreamworld


[7/18/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I think probably separating out the Primal Realms (with perhaps a different name) and associating these with the Riving, perhaps involving some Void Mind shenanigans, is much more straightforward than trying to force these things into the Divine Realms / Spiritual Realms


[7/18/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
then the embodied gods, incorporeal gods, dreamworld, land of dead, [[plane of souls]] are all "Age of Creation" things layered on top of the metaphysical structure created by the RIving


[7/18/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
and this also potentially creates space for e.g. undead to leak from the shadowfell, or lycanthropes from Pandemonium, or demons from the Abyss, in the age of creation


[7/18/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
I found the early campaign “hell is made by humans because you imagine it” vibe kinda appealing. But it is potentially hard to fit into a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean there doesn't have to be a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
I’ve never been happy with Shadowfell, honestly and it seems kinda odd. Didn’t you run a one shot for Riswynn in the Shadowfell or was that somewhere else?


[7/18/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the way the shadowfell has worked so far is not as a permanent echo realm but more like "domains of dread" like Ravenloft. mini-echo-realms created by some powerful trauma/evil/whatever


[7/18/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is kind of like fey domains in that the boss controls the vibe and the terrain echoes the material world, but very unlike in that you generally can't straightforwardly just walk across the borders


[7/18/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
and theoretically you could have mulitple overlapping shadowfell domains echoing the same spot


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that is more interesting and consistent with taelgar metaphysics than any kind of permanent equivalent of the feywild just in reverse


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but still thinking


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i have a meeting now but more later


[7/18/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
RIght I like that a lot - Shadowfell per se doesn't exist, and perhaps there isn't even a specific word/language/culture/whatever.... But there are a bunch of shadowy/dark echo realms, with a kind-of anti-life vibe...

That fits well with Delwath's backstory as well


[7/18/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
A few thoughts for later..

(1) Agree on energy realms / plane of magic / etheral plane from the Riving
(2) Agree on Shadowfell not fey & not a thing but more a type of mini-echo realm
(3) Not sure about undead. Do undead really need a plane? It seems to me that they are very much a material plane phenomena. Doesn't mean a vampire or lich couldn't create a "shadowfell" domain of dread, but I don't think that the undead really need a "home plane" in any sense
(4) Agree that the core "divine" realms and the core "primal" realms should be thought of separately. 
(5) Agree that the Dreamworld/Land Of Dead/[[Plane of Souls]] needs separate thought


[7/18/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Some questions:

(a) how does a divine realm come to be? I don't know the answer but my instinct says that the embodied gods & the incorporeal gods probably create them the same way. I think if it is in some sense under the gods control that explains a lot of the differences, i.e. Shakun created her own realm for Reasons rather than joining the realm of the Dunmari family, which was one realm for Reasons. 
(a - 1) if the gods create the divine realms, that kinda means that until the pantheonic era, there were no divine realms for humans
(a - 2) how does this relate to souls, which are pretty well established as "returning to their deity" after death in some fashion
(a - 3) how does this relate to small gods ideas of death, where there is no divine realm?
(a - 4) what about Thark and other embodied void mind gods. Can they create divine realms as well?


[7/18/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
(b) What is the [[Plane of Souls]] / Dreamworld / Land of Dead and when was it created? 

The canon we have so far suggests that the [[Plane of Souls]] and Dreamworld are closely connected, and also closely connected to the *living*. The [[plane of souls]] is like an echo realm almost, but just echoing the souls of those who are alive on taelgar. (Maybe it is an echo realm, creating in the Riving?)

The Dreamworld is has very little canon to it, other than as a place of imagination/dreams/possibilities. I used it in my game once as a place where the party was trapped during a cursed sleep. 

Here's what we wrote in college, which actually still feels kinda right:

The Dreamworld: The Dreamworld is an echo, shadow, and premonition of Taelgar.  The Dreamworld is a realm that contains echoes of the present, past, and future blended together.  Prophecy, and the ability to sense the past associations of an object are strongly tied to connections to the Dreamworld.  The Dreamworld can also, under the influence of a powerful master, be used to send messages, influence dreams, and similar things.  It is at once a part of, and not a part of, Taelgar.


[7/18/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
So thinking about this a bit when I should be working it feels like metaphysically, the [[Plane of Souls]] and the Dreamworld are really a sort of echo realm, and probably created in the Riving, and actually might be very different from the land of the dead


[7/18/2024 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure this long stream of conscious is helpful, but what about something like the following....

(1) In the aftermath of the Riving, the planes are separated, and at least the Energy Realms, Ethereal Realm, Plane of Magic, and the Echo Realms (including the Feywild, the Dreamworld, the [[Plane of Souls]], plus any other random planes like the Mirror Realm and the rumored Nightmare Realm) are created. Plus of course the Material Plane

(2) the embodied gods create their divine realms as they see fit, as they are created. TBD is what about the Void Mind gods, and can they create realms to? Probably yes, but they might not all want to, given the void mind vibe.

(3a) maybe the Land of the Dead is explicitly created as a buffer between the gods and Taelgar during the Downfall, in response to the Void Mind attacks? That could be a mechanism for explaining why it became harder for belief to create gods. (Although this might be too big a change and not quite fit the already established religious history). (3b) Alternatively, maybe the Land of the Dead is in some sense part of the creation of humans. So before the land of the dead, the firstborn souls were taken up by their gods directly from Taelgar.


[7/18/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like the implications of (3b) that unleashing the divine spark into the multiverse had other consequences


[7/18/2024 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
Ok..here's a story. What do you think?

In the beginning, magic was all there was. In the Age of Myth before time, there was no life or death, per se, no mortality, and no souls. Magic fueled everything, and time didn't have meaning. Everything that lived at this time was in some sense a being of pure magic.

Then, in the Riving, as the magic of the multiverse was being ordered into the Energy & Ethereal & Magic Planes, the Divine introduced something new: souls. Not made of magic, but something else, that have never existed before.

And the embodied gods & the [[plane of souls]] were both shaped out of soul stuff, this new thing. And the embodied gods used the power of their soul stuff to guide and create living beings from the soul stuff in the [[plane of souls]], and shape a new kind of life. As the first souls died, and drifted back to the [[plane of souls]], the embodied gods recognized their work, and swept their souls up, and built realms for them, also out of soul stuff


[7/18/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
This continued for a while (and as an aside, Thark fits in nicely here as perverse creation, not really made of soul stuff at all, not properly, and so he is only able to steal the soul stuff from the other gods and chain and bind it, not create it himself)...

And then the Divine created humans. Humans were a new thing again, made of soul stuff but without a creator or guide, with the power of their soul stuff to shape things intact, rather than skimmed by the embodied gods (this sounds like I'm making Cha'mutte's point, embodied gods as leechs)...

And the Divine made the land of the dead for them, so the human soul stuff could have a place to go when it died. And when the early humans died, before their were any gods, they imagined out of their own soul stuff, the primal realms


[7/18/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
So the history of the planes is basically 3 events:

(a) the Riving establishes the Echo/Energy/Ethereal Realsm
(b) in the same moment as the Riving, the creation of souls establishes the [[Plane of Souls]] (and the Dreamworld, which is basically an echo plane of the [[Plane of Souls]])
(c) at the time of creation of humans, the Land of the Dead is created

Then, all the "outer" planes (Primal + Spiritual) are built either by human belief, with the power of their soul-stuff, or by embodied or incorporeal gods, with the power of the soul-stuff of their dead followers

In the early days, the human souls were not flowing to any gods, so the primal planes came to be. But then, as the gods developed, human soul-stuff became more and more a purview of the gods, rather than free-floating human belief.

But in theory, metaphysically, if all the humans decided to stop believing/worshipping the gods, you'd go back to a time when human belief could create new primal planes


[7/18/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
need to think about this all a bit but a few additional points:
(1) Agree that that Dreamworld is functionally an echo realm of the [[Plane of Souls]] - I think this has been established in game already, early on actually in Kenzo's dream journey way back in Karawa. The key distinction between the Dreamworld and what I would call true echo realms is that the geography of the Dreamworld is not tied to the physical geography of the material plane. Shadowfell domains, the Feywild, and the MIrror Realm have, so far, been demonstrated to be geographic echoes (distorted perhaps) of the Material Plane
(2) Agree that the Land of the Dead is a dividing line of sorts, between the [[Plane of Souls]] / Material Plane / echo realms / whatever and the Divine Realms. This is established as well, at least in my secret notes if not in game, and is consistent with a lot of undead lore and lore around resurrection/raise dead etc. (it takes much stronger magic to bring back a soul that has 'passed on')


[7/18/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Not positive I agree that the Land of the Dead is a human thing / created originally for humans, and need to think about the primal realms as imagined by dead humans out of their soul stuff


[7/18/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure I agree with any of the above either; its more one potential idea that at least has a unifying mechanic


[7/18/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Going back to your questions, re: how does a divine realm come to be, I think this is "it is created by a divinity" and that the distinction between embodied and incorporeal gods here is not particularly meaningful. 

How this relates to souls and dead is, I think, fairly clear in my mind as well. The "Spiritual Realms" writ large are basically places where souls can exist, and if they don't eventually end up in one of the "Spiritual Realms", they fade from existence into nothingness. 

Re: Thark, at least in some sense this has to be yes, otherwise orcs from last session wouldn't believe they could poison him with their souls.


[7/18/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there is an unresolved question about the souls of humans who are not taken up by one of the major divinities with an extraplanar realm, and I think there is still an unresolved question about where the non-god-associated spiritual realms come from


[7/18/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
Re: Thark, I'm not sure Thark has to be able to create a divine realm for orcs to believe they can poison him, right? He just has to have some type of existence that is in  place they can reach him. Although a divine realm is probably simplest


[7/18/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
re: echo realms.

My thinking is that an echo realm is just a echo of the Riving, and, in some sense, could be an echo of something other than Taelgar. So the Dreamworld is an echo of the creation of the [[plane of souls]] or whatever.

Is it necessary to assume all echo realms are an echo of the plane of taelgar? Maybe dragons all live in some echo of the plane of magic.


[7/18/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
What's different about the echo realms is they are sorta created by accident. 

Whereas the energy realms are the separation of the stuff of the multiverse from before the Riving.

And the spiritual realms are created by divine beings, on purpose.

(primal realms TBD)


[7/18/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Agree on Echo realms vs Energy realms as you describe - no not all echo realms need to echo the material plane


[7/18/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I think "primal realms" is the wrong word FWIW, at least in some old notes I have 
Arcane magic = Energy realms, plane of magic
Divine magic = Spiritual Realms, Divine Presence
Primal magic = Echo realms, resonances of the Riving


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Interesting


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
but I agree


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
not committed to that as canonical but it is interesting and fits in at least with some centaur lore


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
"outer planes" is the best shorthard term for now, but clearly not the right taelgaresque term


[7/18/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. At some point we need to clarify a bit what fey magic is. Because eventually Kiya is going to want to know exactly how Celyn feels different when he casts a fey spell vs a divine spell


[7/18/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
But putting that aside, I agree that primal is the wrong word.


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Re: magic, I actually think in some ways my older notes are wrong, and there is no reason for such broad generalizations. All magic on Taelgar is the manipulation of extraplanar energy, yes. But mechanically, any player who cares can choose some reasonable source of extraplanar energy to be what they manipulate


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't mean to suggest that "primal" = "rangers and druids"


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Or at least, I didn't read it that way


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
More, I was thinking you meant "there is a 3rd kind of magical ressonance, from the echo realms, which is a different type of magic than arcane or divine"


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
in our high school notes we called this "the magic of Taelgar"


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, but what I'm suggesting is the idea that there are three categories is maybe wrong


[7/18/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
"Plane of Magic" magic and "Pray to Deity" magic are the most common and easiest, perhaps. But "feywild magic", "elemental plane magic", and "other outer plane" magic could all exist


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so if you wanted to play a storm sorcerer or something maybe you don't use traditional "arcane" magic from the plane of magic, but use "elemental magic" from the elemental planes


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
or a circle of dreams druid maybe uses "dreamworld magic"


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
right, I see.


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[7/18/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, a bit far afield from the original discussion. still going to try to type up the history notes, and maybe will try to incorporate some comments on the extraplanar stuff as `%% %%` notes


[7/18/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking about making a stab at updating the cosmology section briefly with this


[7/18/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure if we've agreed to anything


[7/18/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps just that Dreamworld/land of dead don't belong in Spiritual relams and that the Riving created at least

(a) energy + magic + ethereal
(b) dreamworld + [[plane of souls]]

And that the divine spiritual realms were crated by gods, separately
and that the primal realms should be renamed but we don't have a good alternate name


[7/18/2024 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
Also perhaps that the Shadowfell has nothing to do with the fey


[7/18/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe add some notes to the overall multiverse page. i'm not sure anything is settled enough to be worth revising the organization of the cosmology section yet


[7/18/2024 5:10 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is something to be said for "de-canonifying" the current division, i.e. by 
- moving stuff that isn't definitely a spirtual realm out of spiritual realms
- getting rid of "primal realms" as a catagory


[7/18/2024 5:11 PM] .deciusmus
might play around in a PR-branch


[7/18/2024 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
working a bit more on this and wondering about this:

The Riving is actually several ordered events, although the time between them is undefined as the linear progression of time doesn't really make sense until the Riving ends:

1) The Divine Presence separates the material plane from the energy and echo realms, making a place that, while not devoid of magic, is much more stable and safe.

2) The Divine Presence spins out from itself the raw material for souls, which are basically like little fragments of the divine, creating the [[Plane of Souls]] as a kind of undifferentiated swirl. 

3) The Divine Presence creates out of itself the Embodied Gods, and gives them the power to shape soul stuff, but creates the land of the dead as a barrier, limiting the ability of souls to influence the Divine Presence or act beyond the material plane. 

4) The Embodied gods use the soul stuff to create the elves, dwarves, etc, and create their personal domains beyond the land of the dead. This ends the Riving and starts the Age of Creation.


[7/18/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, the creation of humanity is the moment when the Divine Presence allows a break in the Land of the Dead. Humanity is given the divine spark to shape divinity. The incorporeal gods are created because of this barrier.


[7/18/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
The Downfall seals this barrier again, but quite completely


[7/18/2024 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
Actually implies separating the world out into four mythic eras again, with creation of humans as a dividing line, but I think neatly wraps some things up


[7/18/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
The period of time betwen the Creation of Humans and the Downfall is a period when it is relatively easy to create "outer planes". 

Some are created by human beliefs. Some are created by the Void Mind's agents, descendants, etc. Some maybe are created by strange and unlikely events.


[7/18/2024 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Afterward, after the Downfall, the metaphysical world is largely fixed. But the barrier is not **completely** sealed, to leave open the possibility of weird stuff, new gods, as needed


[7/18/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
I like the first part, but I don't think it needs to be a set of linearly ordered events exactly. Is causality even unidirectional in the Age of Myth? Aerin going back to before the Riving somehow creates kenku, right? Who says that order has meaning?


[7/18/2024 6:38 PM] .deciusmus
But sure, from a "untangling for ease of understanding" I like it


[7/18/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, I guess for ease of human minds to understand it makes sense to say in some way creation of the [[plane of souls]] and creation of embodied gods has to precede the creation of the elder folk but in metaphysical reality causality doesn't have to be unidirection


[7/18/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
So the mythic history becomes:

all magic, no souls
soul stuff created, but its influence is locked to Taelgar itself
door opened, soul stuff can influence the metaverse
oops, that's too dangerous, patch it up by the door can never be fully closed


[7/18/2024 6:41 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, yes


[7/18/2024 6:42 PM] rsulfuratus
what I like about it is that it allows for any random "outer plane" someone wants to make, and no reason for it fit into a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
Right so basically an “outer plane” is just something created with soul stuff at some level


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
But each outer plane can / should have a specific origin story


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
I like that a lot actually


[7/18/2024 6:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that I would the astral plane basically the undifferentiated soulstuff beyond the land of the dead (while the [[plane of souls]] is the differentiated soulstuff on the material plane side of the land of the dead)


[7/18/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and then any plane made of soulstuff floats in the astral plane and has some kind of origin story


[7/18/2024 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not convinces the astral plane needs to exist


[7/18/2024 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
Is it too religious-vibe to have soul stuff be the Divine Presence?


[7/18/2024 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is it too religious-vibe to have the soul stuff be the Divine Presence. And also is probably inconsistent with it being shaped into outer planes by Void Mind things


[7/18/2024 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is the Divine Presence imbuing some if its creative magic into something new


[7/18/2024 6:52 PM] rsulfuratus
also re: astral plane, I think it is useful to have a way to travel to the outer planes that isn't plane shift


[7/18/2024 6:52 PM] .deciusmus
Are elven , dwarven , and human souls different in some metaphysical way?


[7/18/2024 6:53 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't know but I'm not sure there is any reason for them to be


[7/18/2024 6:54 PM] .deciusmus
What about the idea that the divine presence basically creates the astral plane - the source of soul stuff - in imitation or learning from the plane of magic - and elves and dwarves and everyone else is created when the embodied gods pass the soul stuff from the astral plane to the [[plane of souls]]


[7/18/2024 6:55 PM] .deciusmus
Humans are the first souls that go freely in some sense which is why they have the divine spark


[7/18/2024 6:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i like that


[7/19/2024 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
pretty busy today but noodling a bit when I have time. Rewrote the summary as:

The **Age of Myth**, when the multiverse was new, a period before time itself was created. The Age of Myth begin with the first act of creation and are a time of the archfey, titans, elements, and great wyrms, a time when the power of arcane magic coursed unchecked through the multiverse and altering reality was as simple as a thought. This age ends with [[Riving]] when the [[Divine Presence]] separates the planes of existence from each other and creates the [[Material Plane]]. This was a time of huge empires and incredible acts of magic, but also of much chaos.

The **Age of Creation** began after [[Riving]], when the multiverse was created, and ended with the [[Creation of Humans]] and the breaking of the barriers that contained and constrained the creative force of ~soulstuff~. It was during the Age of Creation that the [[Elder Folk|oldest sentient species]] of Taelgar were created by [[Embodied Gods]], when the vast civilizations of [[elves]], [[Dwarves|dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and others spread across the world. This is the golden age of the non-human species, but also a time that lacked dynamism. Little changed or was truly new in this age, as the Firstborn of the Elder Folk encouraged sameness and uniformity.


[7/19/2024 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
The **Age of Divinity** began with the [[Creation of Humans]], and the shattering of the walls that isolated the [[Material Plane]] and kept the creative force of ~soulstuff~ from affecting the wider multiverse. Humans, created by the [[Divine Presence]] itself on [[Hkar]], were unlike anything that had come before, for they were granted the Divine Spark, the ability of their beliefs to shape the very reality of the multiverse, creating [[Incorporeal Gods]] out of the material of creation itself. This was an age of great change, as the greatest hopes and darkest fears of humanity were manifest in ~soulstuff~. It was also an age when other, darker things were created by the machinations of the [[Void Mind]]. The Age of Divinity ended with the the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the destruction of [[Hkar]], and the diminishment of the power of the Divine Spark on the [[Material Plane]]. 

The **Age of Humanity** began with the sinking of [[Hkar]] and the reshaping of the world that accompanied the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. This age saw the rise and fall of Drankor, and the rise and fall of Cha'mutte, and much growth and change among human cultures. This age saw, for the first time, humanity growing to dominant the cultures of Taelgar, and the history of this age is dominated by the history of humanity.


[7/19/2024 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
I like it


[7/19/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a few small tweaks...still working through in 5-10 minute chunks around more pressing actual work


[7/19/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
Is it better to add feedback here or push my own tweaks?


[7/19/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
One comment:

> Throughout the long Age of Creation, the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation, through which only the [[Embodied Gods]] could reach


[7/19/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure it matters, but is this metaphysically true? Also, if the barrier is truely strong, does that mean there are no clerics / divine magic until humans are created?


[7/19/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure the metaphysics of the barrier matter nor questions like where do souls come from.


[7/19/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
Implication is supposed to be that divine magic comes from the firstborn who can reach through. But agree probably not worth spending a ton of time on


[7/19/2024 1:15 PM] rsulfuratus
But metaphysically just supposed to set up the contrast with age of divinity when outer planes get created beyond those associated with embodied gods


[7/19/2024 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
right. might be worth clarifying the impact, i.e. (although secondarily, could the embodied gods reach through easily, i.e. unlike in the current age, could gods act more easily and directly on the world?)


Throughout the long Age of Creation, the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation. Although the [[Embodied Gods]] could reach across this barrier, to grant miracles and change the Material Plane, the magic of souls could not act, except through the Embodied Gods.


[7/19/2024 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
Or something

re: multiverse, pushed this:

While there are many ways to describe the multiverse, the most widely known comes from elven scholars, who describe the multiverse a pair of intersecting domes: the below, the dome of the physical planes rising from the roiling chaos of the [[Plane of Magic]]; above, the dome of the planes of sentience, descending from the blinding intensity of the [[Plane of Creation]].  

The duality of the [[Material Plane]] -- the physical structures of the universe -- and the [[Plane of Souls]] -- the soul structures of the sentient inhabitants of the universe -- sit in the middle of these domes, the Material Plane anchored to the dome of physicality, the [[Plane of Souls]] anchored to the dome of sentience. 

Descending "below" the material plane in this cosmology is the [[Ethereal Plane]], which stretches from the border ethereal, co-localizing with the material plane, through the interior ethereal, a foggy expanse of swirling mists, to the deep ethereal, which bleeds into the [[Plane of Magic]]. Embedded within the "sea" of the [[Ethereal Plane]] are the [[Energy Realms]], chief among them the [[Elemental Planes]], domains of pure physicality, capturing the essence of the fundamental elements of the universe.


[7/19/2024 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
Floating "above" the [[plane of souls]] in this cosmology is the [[Astral Plane]], which is bisected by the [[Land of the Dead]], a collecting point for souls and an not-quite-impermeable barrier separating the raw energy of creation from the [[Material Plane]]. Beyond the [[Land of the Dead]], the [[Astral Plane]] is a strange empty expanse of silvery waves, in which the [[Spiritual Realms]] float like bubbles, until it merges with the blinding energy of the [[Plane of Creation]]. 

Layered on top of this cosmology, the elven scholars speak of the [[Echo Realms]], the distortions and reflections and reverberations of the planes created by the [[Riving]], which still resonance today. Most notably, these include the [[Feywild]], an echo of the material plane, and the [[Dreamworld]], an echo of the plane of souls, but others have been described, including the domains of the [[Shadowfell]], the [[Nightmare Realm]], and the [[Mirror Realm]].


[7/19/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
I like that. I was playing around with using Shadowfells (plural) rather than Shadowfell, as a way to express the idea of different independent domains better



[7/26/2024 9:12 AM] rsulfuratus
working a bit on filling in multiverse / cosmology detail from the riving, and wondering about your feelings about the connection between metaphysics and mechanics. 

for example, at the moment based on the way magic is set up in world, there isn't an obvious way to play a fey cleric. unless you have an unusual backstory where you came to worship a "foreign god"

not sure how i feel about that? 

it particularly impacts the children of the divine, although also potentially also impacts the "unusual species" 

more generally, the basic logic of "divine magic is miracles granted by a god" poses a bit of a challenge for societies that don't seem to innately have gods (centaurs, merfolk, fey, etc) - do they also not have divine magic? and if they don't have divine magic is that a mechanical thing or can they have "clerics" just who generate the same effects from non-divine magic?


[7/26/2024 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea of divine magic = miracles granted by a god and in general feel like it’s better to not get too focused on D&D mechanics


[7/26/2024 10:07 AM] .deciusmus
But I do think there is a bit of a gap around non-arcane / non-divine magic


[7/26/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
That is, clearly on Taelgar there is:
Arcane casters who channel the plane of magic somehow
Divine casters who specifically get miracles from their gods
“Other casters” = lots of other magical things that are currently somewhat ill defined in the metaphysics


[7/26/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
I think that “other” category is where things like fey clerics and merfolk clerics would fall


[7/26/2024 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm thinking more about two distinct gaps. 

1) Do we care about matching mechanics to lore? That is, cleric/paladin spells in D&D have a certain flavor that is distinct from especially wizard spells. In some cases we've adopted D&D mechanics into lore (e.g., resurrection magic), in other cases not. Is there a reason to think that there are certain kinds of magical effects that are far more straightforward to create by divine magic than other ways? In some sense I think this is already in the lore to a certain extent, e.g. divine miracles tend to be around healing, things like that, but people don't go to a hedge wizard for healing and "Chardonian arcane magical energy" is not really focused around healing, it is things like controlling the wind, minor cantrips for cleaning and light, that kind of thing. Putting aside PC mechanics, is it therefore good or bad to have this play a significant role in worldbuilding, that is should, e.g., fey culture lean heavily away from healing, bless, that type of thing which is coded as "divine magic"? 

(2) Separately, it sometimes feels as if there is something of a gap in the divine order. Is it really the case that *every* society that is not either human or one of the elder folk (including orcs) just doesn't worship gods at all? maybe yes, but I'm not sure I agree


[7/26/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
Re: other magic, I guess I haven't really seen this as a gap? Magic is just applying extraplanar energy to defy typical physics so the source of that extraplanar energy can come from anywhere. 

Fey magic is just manipulating the resonances of the Riving to alter material plane physics using "fey logic". 

Many druids might use resonances of the Elemental Planes, others might use the natural echos of the Riving in the Material Plane itself.


[7/26/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
(More in a bit)


[7/26/2024 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
A few quick thoughts...

(a) I do think that the general "tone" of divine vs arcane magic works, but also I think it doesn't have to be extremely precise or pre-decided. Fey for example seem like they'd lean heavily into enchantments and illusions but I wouldn't worry too much if that crosses the "cleric" vibe boundary (i.e. bless feels like a fey spell, maybe with a different gloss, but healing maybe less so in general). And I think it is good that Chardonian hedge wizards don't know healing spells.

(b) I actually like that gods are a specific thing, not just this idea that every culture has to have a god. I'm not sure that means that no cultures can worship anything at all... isn't the idea of the "arch fey/great wrym/elder elemental/titan"  vibe to set up this alternative power structure that can provide god-like creatures in cultures were it makes sense?


[7/26/2024 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
It may be interesting to explore, what, if anything, is the metaphyiscal difference between the children of the divine vs embodied gods vs children of belief


[7/26/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the part I'm uncertain about is what is, exactly, an archfey? or a great wyrm?


[7/26/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
the lore developing around the early days / mythic history strongly focuses on humanity as the creative force behind "outer planes", with some impact of embodied gods


[7/26/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
but if the "outer planes" are strongly tied to elder folk + humans, where are all the titans of old?


[7/26/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
So one direction is to play into the idea of the "[[plane of creation]] / soul stuff" as something that the children of the divine lack access to. The titans are somewhere else, not an outer realm, but somewhere associated with the "lower planes" in your cosmology


[7/26/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
The other direction, I think, is to say that's wrong, and all the children of the divine presence are sorta similar


[7/26/2024 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
right, I think this is the fundamental vibe check I'm looking for


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
and so titans and great wyrms and archfey are really not metaphyically different from embodied gods or human gods


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
metaphyiscally, is there something really very different about the first creations of the divine presence (elder elementals, titans, etc) and the second creations of the divine presence (embodied gods)


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
right exactly


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure the answer


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
the details, I think, don't matter too much, but the vibe makes a big difference. especially on fey lore


[7/26/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
and kiya's questions about ultimately what is different between fey magic and wyrdling magic


[7/26/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
What happens when a fey dies is an interesting question


[7/26/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think it is easier to work out the vibes via thinking about whether there is something different about fey / giants / centaurs / merfolk / etc vs elves / dwarves / orcs / humans


[7/26/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Which I am torn on... on the one hand, one of the things I like about the metaphysics is this idea of the "firstborn" vs "humans" and the metaphysical differences


[7/26/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
On the other hand, I don't love priviledging one group of species as "real people with souls" and therefore implying centaurs / fey etc don't have souls in the same way


[7/26/2024 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
but if centaurs or merfolk are the same as elves, what makes the "elder races" special and distinct?


[7/26/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
from one perspective, it is just because they were created in the age of creation, there is nothing else really distinct about them. just a question of timing, really


[7/26/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure I agree / like that, but it is a possibility


[7/26/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
the firstborn are also the first entities that are called gods at least, and basically invent the concept of "deity"


[7/26/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe the root cause of Cha'mutte's war is that he was angry the so-called Firstborn claimed all the credit for their fancy ideas about "divinity" when really the true children of the divine were there are along. recast it as like a divine sibling war from greek myth


[7/26/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
on a mechanical level, I don't think it works for fey, etc to be "soulless", fwiw. putting aside any lore reasons, we also have for example the canonical fact of agata's soul hiding out in Seeker's ring


[7/26/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
Right, agreed


[7/26/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
Getting in car to drive Z but I’ll ponder more


[7/26/2024 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
So, a few thoughts while I eat lunch...


[7/26/2024 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
a) I think as first principles we should lean towards sticking with the basic idea around "firstborn (+orcs)" vs "humans" vs "hobgoblins" and that, atlhough it doesn't have to be canon that the firstborn are special and different, we should try to make that work before changing it. 

b) I think we are agreed that there is a wide variety of sentient creatures on Taelgar that are neither humans/hobgoblins/firstborn/orcs, but that nevertheless have a soul (in the sense of a essence that is distinct from the material body and that can be ressurected, banished, stolen, trapped, etc


[7/26/2024 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
c) From a vibes perspective, I think there are clear divisions within the sentient creatures between "species" and "magical entities". WIthout necessarily getting into a sidetrack about where do babies come from and so on, there is definitely a different vibe around say fey - who are all a "type" but where hags don't so obviously start life as baby hags vs say dwarves, elves, or kenku, who all clearly have some type of species continuity


[7/26/2024 1:28 PM] rsulfuratus
So, just throwing out some thoughts. Part my impetus for thinking about this is the idea of the “barrier of the land of the dead”, which sets up a very strong metaphysical distinction between eg demons (who cannot be killed on an “inner plane”, merely banished), and “creatures of the ~inner planes~


[7/26/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
But then you get the problem of what all these other species are?


[7/26/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
And I guess I lean towards they all basically work the same way at a fundamental metaphysical level


[7/26/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Which isn’t to say the “elder folk” isn’t a meaningful category


[7/26/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
But, on the other hand, the centaurs are the star of their own story too


[7/26/2024 1:32 PM] rsulfuratus
Which I think is consitdtent with your point (b)


[7/26/2024 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
One stab at a synthesis...

In the Age of Myth, all was changeable, and the flexibility of raw magical energy meant that although an infinite number of things could be created, at the same time nothing was "real". Only the children of the divine, not their creations, had permenance/self/soul, for they had been given soul-stuff by the Divine. These direct children of the divine are rare and powerful, basically they are the same as the embodied gods metaphysically. 

In the moment of the RIving, however, with the creation of the Astral Plane and the the [[Plane of Creation]], the echoes and reverberations allowed this soul stuff to be "caught" by some of the echoes and creations of the Children of the Divine, giving them permeance and self, and power, in some sense proportional to the luck/skill/whatever that allowed one fey bundle of magic to catch much more of the essence of creation than another


[7/26/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
... I'm not totally sure where I am going with this


[7/26/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
But I guess the thought was to set up a distinction between

(a) fey and elementals, in particular, who are more creations of the echo realms, in some way, than creations of any particular god
(b) set up fey in particular as having a gradient of power. Some arch fey are much more powerful than others, and I wonder if any of the original, god-like children of the divine archfey really still exist?


[7/26/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is fine as far as it goes


[7/26/2024 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I’m more thinking about though, from a basic “soul” point of view, what’s the line? 

In current lore, you have humans/elder folk with clear metaphysics, and everything else very vague. 

I’m leaning toward something that is more: any sentient, self-aware being on Taelgar is, in some way, partially made of ~soul stuff~


[7/26/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
The details can be blurry and variable for different species, of course


[7/26/2024 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
The one plausible exception might Far Realm aberrations


[7/26/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
I also think there is potentially a reasonable way to make a metaphysical distinction between some different types of creatures, specifically:

(a) the echo/inner realm inhabitants - in particular fey and elementals, but maybe some others as well, who clearly have souls but also, I am pretty sure, don't have "creator gods" and also have (I think) wide variants in power between different ones of the same "type"

(b) the demons/devils/angels/etc - outer plane inhabitants - who are, in some sense, "native soul stuff", and are much more directly tied to the energy of creation and the barrier of the land of the dead and so on

(c) far realms creatures, who I think definitely don't have Taelgarian souls at all, and are odd and unique and come from "elsewhere"

(d) the elder folk (+ orcs), whose soul stuff was distinctly, uniquely, and specifically shaped by their firstborn (+ maybe the kenku, pending Aerin's specifics)

(e) humans, whose soul stuff is explicitly shaped/given by the Divine Presence and has the Divine Spark

(f) the unique creatures: centaurs merfolk kobolds giants at least, maybe others. But what distinguishes unique creatures from elder folk + humans is that, for whatever reason, their soul stuff did not come from a god or other specific "divine" entity



[7/26/2024 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
What really distinguishes (d) from (f) is not metaphysics but origin. The creaturs in (d) are a unique category because they have gods who shape their soul stuff into their species. The creatures in (f) do not have gods, or at least, if they worship something, it isn't their creator


[7/26/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think all makes sense. Although for example merfolk might very workshop the sentient ocean, who is their creature but not a god (in the sense of being a being of “creative energy”)


[7/26/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
*worship


[7/26/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
So metaphysically, devils are functionally gods, just very weak ones


[7/26/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
As being of “pure soul stuff”


[7/26/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
Right in the case of the merfolk the metaphysics are probably very different than say dwarves. The sentient ocean as a Far Realm being has no access to "taelgar soul stuff" in the way an embodied god would, and whatever magic was used to create/awaken/etc the merfolk they got their souls in some different way than being given them by the sentient ocean


[7/26/2024 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. Although the same is true of ghosts and dead humans, right?


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Hmm. I’m not sure why the sentient ocean couldn’t have access to ~soul stuff~. I think what I’m arguing for is thinking of -soul stuff- as essentially another force like magic


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
But obviously a lot harder to use


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess being made of soul stuff and being able to access it for magic are two different things


[7/26/2024 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
so, to summarize, I think the logic is:

(1) major divisions of living or sort-of-living things in Taelgar:

(a) Sentient, self-aware creatures that are native to the "inner realms" (echo realms + energy realms + anything else that might be invented that is "protected" from the raw power of the [[Plane of Creation]] by the Land of the Dead), are sentient and self-aware because they are animated by a fragment of ~soulstuff~. When they die, this fragment typically travels to the Land of the Dead, and eventually passes beyond into the "Outer Realms". 

(b) Sentient, self-aware creatures native to the "outer realms" (spiritual realms + astral plane + anything on the "[[Plane of Creation]]" side of the Land of the Dead) are pure beings of soulstuff, manifest into physical form. When killed in the "inner realms", they return to their native plane, possibly changed. They can only be fully destroyed when beyond the Land of the Dead. 

(c) Some creatures (many constructs, some undead, simlacrums, perhaps some elementals, etc) are sentient and self-aware but only by using the raw energy of the Plane of Magic in imitation of "soulstuff". These creatures simply cease to exist if destroyed, wherever they are.


[7/26/2024 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(d) Creatures from the Far Realms, where different rules apply.


[7/26/2024 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(e) Beasts or other kinds of non-self-aware, non-sentient creatures are just creatures


[7/26/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, most of the "interesting" distinctions are within (a), and this has a lot to do with origin stories and how each individual species / creature gained access to "soulstuff".


[7/26/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
This all fits pretty well with the Creating New Species document, although I think the distinctions in (a) probably don't map well onto that document


[7/26/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the big vibe shift is kind of opening things up to diverse ways that various non-divine entities might have had access to "soul stuff magic" to create things


[7/26/2024 2:11 PM] .deciusmus
I would also add that I think it is worth establishing that within (a) there is basically 3 categories:

(a) humans, who were given Divine-Spark-enabled soul stuff directly from the Divine Presence
(b) the "created" races (elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk, stoneborn, orcs, and maybe kenku) who are distinguished via the story of a creator god who specifically shaped them
(c) other (everyone else) whose only real distinguishing trait should be that they are not (b)


[7/26/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I'm not sure how that plays out exactly, but I still think it is important to preserve something unique about the "firstborn" races


[7/26/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
That is, I guess I mean, I still think it is worth thinking about how (b) is different from (c) in a way that provides a canonical reason why centaurs and merfolk were not targeted by Cha'mutte


[7/26/2024 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I would say that the clear metaphyiscal uniqueness there is actually in the nature of the embodied gods


[7/26/2024 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
that is, you have say four (currently) types of beings that are "made of soulstuff"


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
(a) the children of the divine
(b) the embodied gods
(c) the incorporeal gods and everything related to them (which would, in this case, stretch to natives of "outer planes")
(d) the divine presence themselves


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
the unique think about the firstborn is they are the only sentient species created by (b)


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right so the idea would be that actually you have a distinction like

(a) humans, created by Divine Presence
(b) firstborn, created by the Embodied Gods, who are a specific group with unique commonalities 
(c) others, created by something or someone else, who is definitely not an Embodied God, because the embodied gods are specific group of entities


[7/26/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[7/26/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually think this implies perhaps a bit of revision of the void mind and the three despairs, to make Thark unique as the only embodied god among the Void Mind creations

{Reactions}
👍

[7/26/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
which is in practice how things have played out in game, with Thark clearly distinct from e.g. Jinnik


[7/26/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
It also suggests that the earlier statement - that there is nothing special about the embodied gods - is probably wrong


[7/26/2024 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there is nothing special in the sense that they, like the children of the divine and the incorporeal gods, are "powerful beings made of the energy of creation"

but, metaphysically, there is something unique about the way they are created that is distinct from the way the children of the divine or the incorporeal gods are created


[7/26/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
the original idea is that they are physically embodied in a way the incorporeal gods are not, and so are not tied to belief in the same way. so there are differences


[7/26/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
Radical thought: should titans elder elementals arch fey great worms actually still exist?


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
what, like Cha'mutte was the last of his kind?


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
What if, for the most part, they were somehow consumed/destroyed/turned into echos during the Riving



[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
although that raises questions. like, what is Gazankoa if not an elder elemental?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
or the various archfey?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
or, i guess, maybe the point is there were once *even more powerful* versions of these that disappeared?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that was the idea


[7/26/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
The archfey are just really powerful fey now. None of the existing arch fey were actually alive in any meaningful sense before the riving


[7/26/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure that is an important detail to decide on at the moment, but worth keeping in mind


[7/26/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I guess its more a vibe-thing: I don't think we should necessarily think of Ethlenn and Gazankoa and Cha'mutte as necessarily "siblings" or "part of the same creation"


[7/26/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
or even "the same type of thing" in the way that Elmerca and the Bahazeal are "the same type of thing"


[7/26/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, from a vibes perspective I think that makes sense, but also there could have been a lot of diversity pre-Riving. and how would you even remember stuff if linear casuality doesn't work? it is possible that entities that survived the riving emerged deeply changed


[7/26/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
