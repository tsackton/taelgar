(Jul 19 2023)

So I've been thinking about the MTP people as I feel like one of the big things that is really missing in the western parts of the Green Sea is some sense of who they are.

  

There is some conflicting information between the "History of Humanity" and "Divine Order" documents about the relative prevalence of intercessionary vs pantheonic religions and whether southerners were intercessionary or not. I'm not sure it really matters which doc is right, but in thinking about the MTP culture, it seems a few things are dictated by the history:

  

* They are one of the blended east-south cultures but could have been settled by neo-east or old-east types

* They are close enough to the borders of Drankor to have been converted to Mos Numena, but don't have to have been

* They have enough of a unique cultural tradition that they probably shouldn't just pick up the Cymean/Sembaran/Chardonian flavors of Mos Numena

  

It also seems to me that the metaphysicals of Taelgar suggest that broadly, pantheons spread, rather than there being lots of them, but intercessionary traditions are more loose and likely have more variety. I kinda like the feel that there is pretty much one pantheon, and the other pantheons that survive tend to have very strong cultures attached to them (Dunmar, Skaer(?)). So that suggests to me that the MTP culture should be one of:

  

1.  A pantheonic religion which introduces a new broadly east/southern pantheon that is probably worshiped in some form all along the south coast and out into the far East

2. A very specific culture like the Dunmar or Skaer with its very culturally specific pantheon

3. A new flavor of Mos Numena

4. Intercessionary although I don't think we should repeat any form of the northern "small gods"

5. The long mentioned, never defined direct access to the divine spark people

  

My loose feeling is that the MTP culture is much more blended than say the Dunmari, with lots of intermixing and mingled cultural influences, such that its actually changed a fair bit even in the last couple hundred years.

  

Given that feeling, I'd feel like option 2 is less appropriate, and also, it feels like they should not just be "the same as the Skaer but to the south". They also for some undefined reason don't feel like the mediation people (#5) -- they seem to me to be on Irrla but maybe not?   
  
There is an argument that it doesn't have to be defined, but also I think there is no harm in filling in some places on the map, and this feels like one of the most likely to be game relevant totally blank places, so I'm enjoying sketching it out.

  

So, with all that said, do you have any thoughts on these options? With the right ideas I think 1 or 4 could both work but 3 is also the easiest to make up and kinda fits with say the highland sembaran kingdoms (which of course have the background of the old religion to give them character)

========

I have been a bit distracted by actually trying to write 3-4 sessions worth of materials for Alexandria so I haven't been able to give this a lot of thought. 

  

We came to basically this same conclusion before in Feb 2021 (search up the "map thoughts" thread) -- I think the MTP culture (what we called the "hong kong climate" people before) remain a bit of a puzzle since they seem like they should be a melting pot culture, with diverse influences, but without any framework for what the Southerners and the southern migrations from Hkar were like it is a little hard to sort out what a blended southern / mariner / Drankor culture would be like from the kind of working forward through history approach.

  

As far as religion - I agree the divine spark religion definitely feels like it makes more sense in Irrla / Ursk / Magic Islands / FNP type places than specifically in MTP. I also think it is clear this is a melting pot culture so a tight pantheon of culturally distinct deities doesn't really fit. 

  

Taelgar does not have an ancestor-worshop culture right now (although Mawar hints as this with the idea that there are ancestor-saints as demigod-like figures; for that matter, Dunmar hints in this direction too). So that could be an option, but I'm not feeling super inspired by that as an option for this place specifically, as it feels like ancestor worship would be susceptible to being swept away by Mos Numena, for example (so then you just get a Mawar-esque Mos Numena + saints, again). Taelgar also does not have anywhere that has a kind of loose, Norse/Greek style pantheon, although I kind of get the sense neither of us are super excited by that. 

  

I think this might be a place where it could make sense to just brainstorm "what would be cool to have in the world" and work backwards to make the history work, rather than vice versa, honestly. I'm just not feeling very inspired at the moment.

======

Don’t let any of this stuff (that doesn’t help your prep) distract from your prep !. It can wait. 

I will say on religion, my brainstorming is basically…

  

(A) blended pantheon with lots of religious openness seems cool but is a little bit copying Tollen’s vibe and there is no farther East pantheon to blend with 

(B) ancestor worship needs a home somewhere but I don’t love it here also, plus I feel it’s a bit more of your thing and I think it should go somewhere you are excited to put it. And Mawar has a fair bit of that flavor so it should really be somewhere that can influence Mawar. 

  

A few random ideas:

  

- something vaguely Zoroastrian. Really strong sense of duality, good vs evil gods, a vision as a combined Arah/Malik as the “good” god working in the world via their 4 or 5 or 7 “hands” which are even more vague than Mos Numena (Right Thought, Right Action, etc) and then with an explicit devil/evil god ala Satan. Could have intersections with Mos Numena in that some people might treat the 8 divines as similar to the “hands” of god

  

- something vaguely Christian — but intercessionary — some single god as the focus of intercession with the over gods, sort of like if Jesus was the primary god, worshipped on his own. 

  

- something with totems or tokens being the focus - intercessionary but focused around the things themselves which develop power somehow ? This is a bit vague just envisioning totemic objects are very important

  

- animism and an emphasis on animal messengers and spirits. Maybe too kestavo/deno’quai

  

- something oriented around gurus and wise teachers and so on, who become intercessionary agents - but no connection to a specific person, ie not answers

  

Anything above jump out at you?

======

My initial gut instinct is that some Zoroastrian/duality focused might be the most interesting. And could fit into the development of the eastern schism, where you have the old east ocean pantheon becoming Skaer (this is moderately "Christian" in feel as it is monotheistic with the ocean god as kind of the Jesus figure), the neo-East divine spark becoming the guru/wise teacher/meditation religion, and then in the "duality" religion as a third branch. 

  

Guru/wise teacher feels more like it belongs in the divine spark religion, in a sense. 

  

Totems/tokens feels interesting but I don't have a good sense of what that would even look like.

  

Animism feels too Deno'qai. 

  

Of course the other thing Taelgar doesn't have is a prophet-based religion. And I'm not totally convinced we should dump the idea of a loose Greek/Norse type pantheon - if it would fit anywhere it is probably in some kind of mixing pot culture. Maybe it has a bit of Roman vibes where it just picks up gods from everywhere so you have versions of the Mos Numena divines, the Dunmari siblings, and other gods that could derive from, say, the Medju/"southern" tight pantheon.
