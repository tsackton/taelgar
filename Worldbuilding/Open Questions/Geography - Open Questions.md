### The Continents
There was a period when we were convinced that there was a northern and southern continent, and in fact even debated what the name for the northern continent should be. This idea - that there is a defined second continent - has lingered in some documents, although we are slowly removing it. That doesn't mean there is definitely not a second continent thought - the open questions are:
* Are there two continents, and if so, does the northern one have a name other than Taelgar? 
* Did humanity call the "mainland" something other than Taelgar (as compared to Hkar)?
* If there was a southern continent pre-Downfall (likely) what is there now?
* How canonical is the map, which actually shows a coastline of a presumed southern continent?

In some earlier imagining we imagined an massive elven empire in the southern continent. On of the players in the aborted/non-canonical "Mike Family Game" (Dana) was in fact an elf from the southern continent, but she wasn't massively interested in worldbuilding so not much came of it.
