This document collects open questions about specific campaigns. Generally not relevant to ongoing, active, clearly canonical campaigns (Addermarch, Great Library, [[Dunmari Frontier Campaign]], [[Cleenseau Campaign]]).

## Canonical Status 

There have been lots of adventures set in Taelgar over the years, and it is not always clear which are completely canonical, which are completely non-canonical, and which may have canonical pieces. 

### Campaigns

Bolded below the line have open questions. 

- Dunmar Frontier: Canonical. First half of campaign in OneNote although many non-DM details have been copied over; second have of the campaign entirely in Obsidian. 
- Cleenseau campaign: canonical. ***Entirely in Obsidian?***
- Great Library campaign: canonical. Both public and DM details are nearly entirely in OneNote, not Obsidian. Set almost entirely (so far) around Voltara, on the northern frontier of the Chardonian Empire. 
- Great War: canonical in vibes and overall arc, but not in detail, except as a source of inspiration. Current day invention should not invalidate the broad sweep of the campaign, or alter the stories of the PCs, but world details have been significantly updated. Notes that are not in Obsidian are largely paper, although a few scattered docs (largely post game worldbuilding in college) may still exist that haven't been imported.
---
- ***Addermarch***: canonical, although currently unmoored in time. Based on surrounding events, set sometime after the Cleenseau campaign, but could be 1720s, 1730s, or 1740s. Most likely late 1720s/early 1730s, but currently still TBD. Entirely in Obsidian. 
- ***Plaguelands***: unclear; this was the first Taelgar campaign and a lot of detail was a bit shaky / early. Has some useful invention around Addermarch, but this has largely been already updated and incorporated into the Addermarch campaign , excepting some NPCs. Details are nearly entirely in OneNote, not Obsidian. The main campaign arc, which was based around the activities of a fey-tinged mysterious organization called the Cinder Court, who kidnapped a bunch of people from a keep near the Darkwood and was going to use them as a sacrifice or something in a mysterious summoning ritual, was never resolved, so a little unsatisfying. Isaac and Kate are playing variants of their original Plaguelands characters in the Addermarch campaign. 

### List of Taelgar Short Adventures

- Mawar Confederacy. Four sessions, plus a 5th I wrote but haven't run. Canonical. Same time as Great Library and Dunmar Frontier. Most details in Obsidian, although some DM notes are still in OneNote. 
- Riswynn and Oskar One Shots. Three sessions. Canonical, happened during Riswynn's first separation from the Dunmar Fellowship (Sessions 17 - 37).  Details entirely in OneNote, not Obsidian. 
- Labyrinths of the Lost. Three sessions. Canonical. Set in Western Cymea, although not anchored in time. Details all in Obsidian.  
- Mike's Family Game. Three sessions. An abortive game with the same plotline that become the [[Cleenseau Campaign]]. Definitively not canonical (as the same events were run again with a different set of PCs) but some small amount of interesting character development that could be reused. 
---
- ***Ausson's Crossing***. Four sessions. ***Status?***
- ***Stone Titan Starter Adventure***. Two sessions. Semi-joke characters. Not anchored in time, although most plausibly tied to the [[Sentinel Range War]]. Possibly the events might be canonical, but perhaps the PCs shouldn't be? Details entirely in OneNote.
- ***Tollen One Shots***. Two sessions (one D&D, one FATE). Spurred a lot of the early development of Tollen. No record of events, PCs, or NPCs, except a few scratched notes in OneNote, timeline ambiguous, and low level adventures so minimal world impact. Might be simplest to consider non-canon?
- ***Informatics one-shot***. Two sessions, set in the Sembaran highlands, on the border of Ardlas. Unclear if it should be canon or not. Most of the location details lifted from a published adventure I adapted for the game. Details in Obsidian.
