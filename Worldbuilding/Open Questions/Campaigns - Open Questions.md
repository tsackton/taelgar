This document collects open questions about specific campaigns. Generally not relevant to ongoing, active, clearly canonical campaigns (Addermarch, Great Library, [[Dunmari Frontier Campaign]], [[Cleenseau Campaign]]).

## Canonical Status 

There have been lots of adventures set in Taelgar over the years, and it is not always clear which are completely canonical, which are completely non-canonical, and which may have canonical pieces. 

### Campaigns

Bolded below the line have open questions. 

- Dunmar Frontier: **Canonical**. First half of campaign in OneNote although many non-DM details have been copied over; second have of the campaign entirely in Obsidian. 
- Cleenseau campaign: **Canonical**. There are no meaningful DM-facing notes outside of Obsidian and no substantial worldbuilding that isn't written down. However there is significant worldbuilding detail in a number of long inter-session email threads that both summarize game events for my players and sometimes ended up in a bit of play-by-email. I have been slowing copying these into obsidian in [[Cleenseau - Raw Emails]]. There are session note writeups for most, but not all, sessions on Kiya's blog. I have copied a small number of these, but definitely not all of them, into Obsidian. The raw blog notes tend to be a combination of meta + plot and often elide some of the world details.
- Great Library campaign: **Canonical**. Both public and DM details are nearly entirely in OneNote, not Obsidian. Set almost entirely (so far) around Voltara, on the northern frontier of the Chardonian Empire. 
- Great War: **Canonical in vibes and overall arc, but not in detail, except as a source of inspiration**. Current day invention should not invalidate the broad sweep of the campaign, or alter the stories of the PCs, but world details have been significantly updated. Notes that are not in Obsidian are largely paper, although a few scattered docs (largely post game worldbuilding in college) may still exist that haven't been imported.
- Plaguelands: **Not canonical**, although some aspects of world buliding served as an inspiration for Addermarch. This was the first Taelgar campaign and a lot of detail was a bit shaky / early. Has some useful invention around Addermarch, but this has largely been already updated and incorporated into the Addermarch campaign, excepting some NPCs. Details are nearly entirely in OneNote, not Obsidian. The main campaign arc, which was based around the activities of a fey-tinged mysterious organization called the Cinder Court, who kidnapped a bunch of people from a keep near the Darkwood and was going to use them as a sacrifice or something in a mysterious summoning ritual, was never resolved, so a little unsatisfying. Isaac and Kate are playing variants of their original Plaguelands characters in the Addermarch campaign.

- ***Addermarch***: **Canonical, although currently unmoored in time**. Based on surrounding events, set sometime after the Cleenseau campaign, but could be 1720s, 1730s, or 1740s. Most likely late 1720s/early 1730s, but currently still TBD. Entirely in Obsidian. 

### List of Taelgar Short Adventures

- Mawar Confederacy. **Canonical.** Four sessions, plus a 5th I wrote but haven't run. Same time as Great Library and Dunmar Frontier. Most details in Obsidian, although some DM notes are still in OneNote. 
- Riswynn and Oskar One Shots. **Canonical**. Three sessions, set during Riswynn's first separation from the Dunmar Fellowship (Sessions 17 - 37).  Details entirely in OneNote, not Obsidian. 
- Labyrinths of the Lost. **Canonical, although not anchored in time**. Three sessions. Set in Western Cymea. Details all in Obsidian.  
- Mike's Family Game. **Definitively not canonical,** (as the same events were run again with a different set of PCs). Three sessions. An abortive game with the same plotline that become the [[Cleenseau Campaign]]. Some small amount of interesting character development that could be reused. 
---
- ***Ausson's Crossing***. Four sessions. Set in 1688. The high level setting, the major NPCs, and three of the four PCs are canonical (all have detailed backgrounds in email or private discord chat with the players). The fourth PC was canonically not present, because the player reused him for Cleenseau game. I have some GDrive notes about the events and adventure, but not good ones. Some background emails to my group expound on the setting in more detail than is captured in Obsidian, but the minor details of 1688 don't have to be canonical. Much of the adventure was improvised or sketched on paper maps that I have since lost. The main plot arc: an avatar of [[G'Zab]] (or perhaps a [[Far Realms]] aberration, the details were never canonical) became lodged in a dwarven mine in [[Ardith]] and possessed a treasure hunting dwarf, who lost his soul and went on a ritual murder spree. The PCs eventually discovered he was the bad guy, stopped him, went into the mine, and killed the aberration. There was a fair bit of improvised events and NPCs in the Aurbez Plateau on the way to the mine, which I would consider non-canonical, similarly the details of the mine. But the bare facts above, plus the setting and NPCs, should be canonical.

- ***Stone Titan Starter Adventure***. Two sessions. Semi-joke characters. Not anchored in time, although most plausibly tied to the [[Sentinel Range War]]. Possibly the events might be canonical, but perhaps the PCs shouldn't be? Details entirely in OneNote.

%% Mike: When constructing the timeline of Sembaran wars, I envisioned this as during the opening part of the [[First Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]], which I had structured as a thrust into the heart of Sembara from the west and which, in some of the Malach/lich notes, I've considered might have been when Malach got somehow involved with mindflayers. I think the general event - a mindflayer driving some type of stone titan - should be canonical, especially as it might play as a historical event to research when my PCs are looking at mind flayers and chaylte golems. But I'm not sure the characters or specific adventure should be canonical, as the "band of misfits band together to sorta defeat the enemy" not be the correct vibe for the events. Suggest pulling in anything on the mindflayer/stone titan adventure but leave the session notes and specific details fuzzy and of unclear canon. We can revisit if it does come up as a detailed backstory for anything in my game %%

- ***Tollen One Shots***. Two sessions (one D&D, one FATE). Spurred a lot of the early development of Tollen. No record of events, PCs, or NPCs, except a few scratched notes in OneNote, timeline ambiguous, and low level adventures so minimal world impact. Might be simplest to consider non-canon?

%% I was never part of these and have no opinion, other than the general one of one-shot stuff with no records is probably not worth the time to try to recreate" %%

- ***Informatics one-shot***. Two sessions, set in the Sembaran highlands, on the border of Ardlas. Unclear if it should be canon or not. Most of the location details lifted from a published adventure I adapted for the game. Details in Obsidian. 

%% Perhaps should be canon only if there is something particularly worthwhile/cool to add from it? I've done very little worldbuilding on the highlands but am always feeling like it needs more development, so worth pulling stuff in, if it was made up and feels 'good enough'. A lightly-Taelgar-skinned published adventure might not be worth it though. %%
