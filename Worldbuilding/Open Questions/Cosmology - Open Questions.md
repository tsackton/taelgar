## Divine Power in Taelgar

A variety of brainstorming documents lean on the idea that the [[Land of the Dead]] is some kind of barrier to divine action on Taelgar, whether from the beginning, or arising during the Riving, or [[Historical Framework - Open Questions#Metaphysics of the Creation of Humanity|later]]. In this metaphysical model, souls on the Plane of Souls serve as conduits for miracles, implying that divine power can only, or mostly only, act via empowering mortals. 

This framework is nice to prevent the gods from being too powerful, and I think the basic metaphysics of the [[Land of the Dead]] forming a barrier between Divine Power and the [[Inner Realms]] is presumably canon, at least in the modern context. 

However, this raises a number of open questions:

- If divine power is primarily manifest by the conduit provided by the Plane of Souls, it strongly implies that only creatures with souls that manifest on the Plane of Souls can use divine magic. So it matters a lot who has souls. 
	- I think that it is obvious that it is not _just_ the creations of the Divine Presence or the Embodied Gods that have souls, at least if we assume that Kenzo's soul sight is metaphysically connected to perceiving the Plane of Souls. Really, it is only some constructs and some undead that don't have souls in this sense
	- Natives of other planes are tricky. Maybe the Yenadlists are right and the Plane of Souls reflects all inner planes? Maybe fey/elementals etc don't use divine magic in the traditional sense and don't have gods per se, but can access the power of divine magic via some other mechanism? Maybe there are actually no fey clerics? Kate played a fey cleric at one point in the Seeker one shot, but we never developed any religion for that character, so it remains an open question whether fey can actually use divine magic in the "normal" sense. 
	- The connection to soul sight (Kenzo) is a bit tricky here too, since my inclination has been to allow that work on essentially everybody. But maybe it isn't actually reading anything from the Plane of Souls and that is just a shorthand. 
- Ultimately, I think for worldbuliding and other reasons it is important that there be limits and barriers to divine power on the Inner Planes side of the [[Land of the Dead]]. However, maybe the premise is wrong, and divine power is not exclusively manifest via the Plane of Souls - that might just be what certain religions teach, or maybe even what the Incorporeal and Embodied Gods believe (leaving open the possibility that the fey have an alternate way to access the magic of the [[Plane of Creation]] directly, for example). In this case, there has to be another limit, or perhaps more accurately a different way than the Plane of Souls to provide a conduit for the magic of creation to flow into the inner planes.

##### Divine Power in Taelgar - Discussion
First thought: the rules of D&D, and in particular the classification of magic into divine/primal/arcane, should only drive the world building so far. Perhaps if we were building a Taelgar RPG, the differences between different types of magic would be encoded in the rules, but I'm not sure the fact that a fey cleric exists needs to imply that the fey can access the [[Plane of Creation]] at all. 

Second thought: Yendalism seems more right to me than "only those on the material plane have souls".

Third thought: A middle ground might be that everyone is wrong and the truth is that every creature native to an Echo Realm has a soul on either the plane of souls or an echo of it. Perhaps the fey access the [[Plane of Creation]] via the [[Dreamworld]]? And in fact a fey cleric doesn't worship a god, per se, just knows how to draw the power of [[Soulstuff]] from the dreamworld. Maybe all fey magic is actually [[Soulstuff]] magic (outside of fey wizards and the like) being pulled from the dreamworld, and the fey have a deep need for all creatures to dream and imagine to keep generating that power.

## Spiritual Realms


The details of the Spiritual Realms are hard to flesh out without a better sense of the kinds of Spiritual Realms, and how they are understood in-world. Minimally, there needs to be three distinct varieties of Spiritual Realms:
- The homes of the Embodied Gods, of which the [[Heart of the Mountain]] is the only one with any lore development. So far, the default assumption is that each embodied pantheon has one plane, but this need not be definitive. 
- The homes of the Incorporeal Gods; none are particularly well developed, except [[Shakun's Realm]] which is potentially a special case. I suspect the model of one plane per pantheon, in general, is probably right, although e.g. the Dunmari Five Siblings must have at least two ([[Shakun's Realm]] and [[Arkaash]], the latter of which so far exists only as a name).
- The various "traditional Outer Planes" that exist in Taelgar: [[Arborea]], [[Pandemonium]], [[Limbo]], the [[Abyss]], and the [[Nine Hells]] at least definitively exist, and I think at least something like a Plane of Order (Mechanus) and a Prison Plane (Caceri) probably exist. But otherwise little is canon here. 

My sense is that it is easiest to travel to the "traditional Outer Planes", then the homes of the Embodied Gods, and last/most difficult the homes of the Incorporeal Gods (which might not really have a real physical existence in most cases, and might function more like simply the body of the Divine or something). 

Also, it is not clear how people who follow Mos Numena, for example, interpret the Dunmari planes. Do they consider these just other gods they don't worship? Do they think of them as just different names for parts of the same gods (a la the high school conception of Aspects of Eru/Melkor)? How would, e.g., a Mos Numena theologian depict Arkaash?

One idea:
In standard [[Mos Numena]] theology, the Spiritual Realms are depicted in a tripartite arrangement: the Mos Numena Divine Realm in the center, often shown as a wide disc fed by the upwelling of the [[Land of the Dead|River of Souls]]; the realms of the [[Embodied Gods]] as spheres surrounding the central disc; and the primal realms, on the edges.

### Alternate Take

Tim - 1/22/2025
working on spiritual realms, now, and i'm actually not sure whether incorporeal gods should, in general, have planes. maybe this is what the original high school conception of the "all the gods are just aspects of the Divine Presence" idea means. Incorporeal Gods are, actually, manifestations of pure [[Soulstuff]] and to the extent they have "homes" it is the Plane of Creation itself. this might actually simplify some things:

- where the souls of people who worship tanshi or kestavo go
- the fact that we've never really had any lore about human "heavens" despite there being a lot of lore about non-human heavens
- the actual metaphysical distinction between incorporal and embodied gods

the only thing that has ever been made up and canonically exists that is associated with a human god is [[Shakun's Realm]], and that is a distinctly unusual place. it is not a place where human souls go in the afterlife, it is basically a trap for the enemies of Dunmar. so it could easily be an echo realm or a demiplane or whatever, much more like Cha'mutte's shadow realms than an Outer Plane.

This line of thought continues here: [[Discord Chat - Homes of Incorporeal Gods]]

## Relationship among Spiritual Realms

Another open question: what is the relationship among the spiritual realms? If the only thing that limits the power of the gods is the [[Land of the Dead]], why don't some gods get together and destroy the Abyss, or kill Thark? 

This feels like it might have a connection to the [[Gidari]] somehow, but not sure.
