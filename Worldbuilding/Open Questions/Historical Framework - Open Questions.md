This document collects open questions about the general [[Historical Framework]] of Taelgar.

### Orenlas and Drankor
What is the relationship between Orenlas and Drankor? Is Orenlas surrounded by Drankor, or do other things prevent it.

## Darkwood Creation
When does the Darkwood become sinister? See towards the end of  [[Discord Chat - Ethlenn and Umbraeth]].
Likely before the Drankorians arrive.


### Metaphysics of the Creation of Humanity
Some older versions of the historical framework implied that both the creation of humanity and the Downfall caused significant changes in the [[Land of the Dead]] and the ability for soulstuff to be shaped and accessed from Taelgar. In particular, we had previously written that:
* Between the Riving and the creation of humans, the [[Land of the Dead]] was impermeable and that this reduced some aspects of divine power
* After the creation of humans, until the Downfall, something changed about this barrier, and divine magic was stronger (or perhaps possible for the first time)

From an older history doc, since removed, but kept here for posterity:
> The Age of Divinity, like the Age of Creation, began with an upheaval of the [[Multiverse]], one with far-reaching impacts but a far less dramatic beginning. Throughout the long Age of Creation, the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation. Although the [[Embodied Gods]] could easily reach across this barrier, to grant miracles and change the Material Plane, the magic of souls could not act, except through the Embodied Gods. With the Creation of Humans, this changed. 

The open question is: Is there any truth to this? Personally I (Mike) don't love it, and prefer the Land of Dead to be unchanging between the Riving and the Downfall. Metaphysical changes in the world to make the creation of new gods difficult or almost impossible post-Downfall do seem sensible though.

### Conflict with the Void Mind
Assuming we accept the framing that the period between the Riving and the Downfall is fundamentally a conflict between the Divine Presence and the Void Mind to determine if in fact Taelgar will continue to exist, the major open question is when does the conflict start? Is it the creation of humanity or is it the Riving?

In a way, I prefer the narrative to be something like:
* Riving - Creation of Humans - the void mind is not active at all; perhaps cannot even do anything really
* Creation of humans "opens the door" to the void mind and initiates the conflict, although initially it is not clear or known that such a conflict is coming
* The Downfall ends the conflict

This framing would suggest that Thark and the hobgoblins were probably both created during the creation of humans.

### Far Realms
At some point, cracks in the Far Realms allow for various aberrations to appear in Taelgar. It is unclear if this happens:
* During the Riving
* During the creation of humans
* Twice, once during the Riving, and once during the creation of humans

This impacts when the [[Sentient Ocean]] fled to Taelgar, as well as some of the vibe of the early period of history.
### Creation of the Orcs
The orcs are canonically the creation of [[Thark]], who is in turn metaphysically an [[Embodied Gods|embodied god]] created in some fashion by the [[Void Mind]], or perhaps one of its [[Three Despairs|avatars]]. This means that orcs are, metaphysically, similar to the other [[Children of the Embodied Gods]].

Undetermined is when the Orcs were created. One possibility is that orcs, in the far reaches of the world, were created before humans, perhaps concurrently with the rest of the Children of the Embodied Gods. A second possibility is that Thark is not able to create the orcs for some reason until later, either late in the shortly before or even after the creation of humans. From a demographic standpoint, orcs are expected to have a very small initial creation, a very high birth rate, and a very high death rate. So it takes a while for them to be noticed, so they cannot be created too late.

Broadly then, there are three simple possibilities for the orcish creation:
* Immediately after or during the Riving, totally unknown to anyone. This works from a "parallel to Elder Folk" but adds some 'darkness' to the otherwise idyllic early period of creation
* Sometime before the creation of humans, perhaps only shortly before. I'm not sure there are any benefits to this, unless the creation of orcs is meant to be some type of trigger for the creation of humans
* At some point after the creation of humans, perhaps shortly after or almost concurrently. This would make them align with the creation of humans and hobgoblins

It is likely not necessary to decide this at the moment, until/unless we want to flesh out the details of the pre-Downfall age and/or the metaphysics of orcs. The most relevant concerns are probably on the transition from "peace" to "defensive empires" amongst the elves and dwarves and the metaphysics of Thark's ability to create orcs in the first place.

### Creation of Hobgoblins
The other major creation of the Void Mind, the hobgoblins, also has an unclear timing. It could, and mostly was, in some sense concurrent with humans, but this does not have to be true. It should not be before humans.

### Earliest Empires
The current narrative of the earliest days of history results in very large mono-species empires as the primary vibe, with significant mixing likely only in:
* The southern Sentinels, where the dwarven and elven empires would interact
* Tyrwingha and Isingue, where the elven and lizardfolk empires would interact
* The Green Sea coasts, where the halflings and lizardfolk would interact

It also results in the central and western areas being dominated by dwarves and elves, and the eastern Green Sea region dominated by halflings and lizardfolk.

In general, there is nothing wrong with this per se, but it is worth exploring the implications before assuming it is fully canonical. This for example implies that the first non-humans the human migrants encounter are elves and perhaps some dwarves. It also feels like perhaps the halflings are missing an opportunity to be more widespread.

Note: one idea discussed in [[Discord Chat - Historical Framework Pre Downfall]] suggests that maybe the Green Sea stretched further inland before the Downfall, and therefore the 'Firstborn' races might all have had mighty civilizations that met at [[Urlich Pass]]. That would preserve one of the ideas from the [[Great War Campaign]] that the final battle with Cha'Mutte was in some way related to the site of the creation of the Firstborn. This would also make the interactions a bit less isolated. 

### Stoneborn Early History
The elves, lizardfolk, halflings, and dwarves all have tentative development for significant early histories with impacts on the post-Downfall world, but the stoneborn are missing from most of this. It may be appriopriate (i.e. lean into them as the most isolationist of the Elder Folk) but this is a pending open question.

### Nature of the Downfall
There is an open question as to the true nature of the Downfall. One idea:

1. When the Divine Presence creates Hkar + the humans, there is literally something metaphysical of themselves that is embedded in Hkar or a part of Hkar. This strengthens and empowers the divine spark in the humans. During the Downfall Wars, the agents of the Void Mind learn of this, and realize if they can possess and corrupt this whatever, they can destroy and corrupt everything that was imagined with the divine spark, perhaps even humanity itself, and dramatically weaken the Divine Prescene. End the ability to create, at some level. And although the battle is still raging, and the Void Mind forces haven't won, it is too much of a risk. And so the Divine Prescence takes back this whatever which sinks Hkar. And metaphysically, makes them farther away from Taelgar, and makes the creation of new gods harder, weakens divine magic.
2. I think my idea of the vibe of the downfall based on this new idea of the void mind wanting to corrupt hkar is that "without our actions, hkar would have been overwhelmed, but ultimately without the sinking of hkar the war could never have ended". So basically, destruction of hkar was a necessary cost, but without the price paid by the firstborn, probably the armies that reached hkar would have achieved their goal and captured the divine spark or whatever before hkar could be destroyed. something like that
