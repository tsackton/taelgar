This document collects open questions about the general historical framework of Taelgar.

### Conflict with the Void Mind
Assuming we accept the framing that the period between the Riving and the Downfall is fundamentally a conflict between the Divine Presence and the Void Mind to determine if in fact Taelgar will continue to exist, the major open question is when does the conflict start? Is it the creation of humanity or is it the Riving?

In a way, I prefer the narrative to be something like:
* Riving - Creation of Humans - the void mind is not active at all; perhaps cannot even do anything really
* Creation of humans "opens the door" to the void mind and initiates the conflict, although initially it is not clear or known that such a conflict is coming
* The Downfall ends the conflict

This framing would suggest that Thark and the hobgoblins were probably both created during the creation of humans.

### Far Realms
At some point, cracks in the Far Realms allow for various aberrations to appear in Taelgar. It is unclear if this happens:
* During the Riving
* During the creation of humans
* Twice, once during the Riving, and once during the creation of humans

This impacts when the [[Sentient Ocean]] fled to Taelgar, as well as some of the vibe of the early period of history.
### Creation of the Orcs
The orcs are canonically the creation of [[Thark]], who is in turn metaphysically an [[Embodied Gods|embodied god]] created in some fashion by the [[Void Mind]], or perhaps one of its [[Three Despairs|avatars]]. This means that orcs are, metaphysically, similar to the other [[Children of the Embodied Gods]].

Undetermined is when the Orcs were created. One possibility is that orcs, in the far reaches of the world, were created before humans, perhaps concurrently with the rest of the Children of the Embodied Gods. A second possibility is that Thark is not able to create the orcs for some reason until later, either late in the shortly before or even after the creation of humans. From a demographic standpoint, orcs are expected to have a very small initial creation, a very high birth rate, and a very high death rate. So it takes a while for them to be noticed, so they cannot be created too late.

Broadly then, there are three simple possibilities for the orcish creation:
* Immediately after or during the Riving, totally unknown to anyone. This works from a "parallel to Elder Folk" but adds some 'darkness' to the otherwise idyllic early period of creation
* Sometime before the creation of humans, perhaps only shortly before. I'm not sure there are any benefits to this, unless the creation of orcs is meant to be some type of trigger for the creation of humans
* At some point after the creation of humans, perhaps shortly after or almost concurrently. This would make them align with the creation of humans and hobgoblins

It is likely not necessary to decide this at the moment, until/unless we want to flesh out the details of the pre-Downfall age and/or the metaphysics of orcs. The most relevant concerns are probably on the transition from "peace" to "defensive empires" amongst the elves and dwarves and the metaphysics of Thark's ability to create orcs in the first place.

### Earliest Empires
The current narrative of the earliest days of history results in very large mono-species empires as the primary vibe, with significant mixing likely only in:
* The southern Sentinels, where the dwarven and elven empires would interact
* Tyrwingha and Isingue, where the elven and lizardfolk empires would interact
* The Green Sea coasts, where the halflings and lizardfolk would interact

It also results in the central and western areas being dominated by dwarves and elves, and the eastern Green Sea region dominated by halflings and lizardfolk.

In general, there is nothing wrong with this per se, but it is worth exploring the implications before assuming it is fully canonical. This for example implies that the first non-humans the human migrants encounter are elves and perhaps some dwarves. It also feels like perhaps the halflings are missing an opportunity to be more widespread.

**Stoneborn Early History**
The elves, lizardfolk, halflings, and dwarves all have tentative development for significant early histories with impacts on the post-Downfall world, but the stoneborn are missing from most of this. It may be appriopriate (i.e. lean into them as the most isolationist of the Elder Folk) but this is a pending open question.
