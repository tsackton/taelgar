This note tries to draw together information from various sources to form a semi-canonical history of humanity in the Greater Sembaran region, intended to inform development of Sembara, Tyrwingha, Maseau, Addermarch, and the Highlands. 

## Before the Downfall

A hundred years before the Downfall, a great lizardfolk civilization stretched from the Western Gulf to the Sentinel Range along the Enst and Wistel rivers. To the south of the lizardfolk, the ancient elven kingdom still stood. 

The Zimka, a northern culture originally from the west, spread over the eastern slopes of the Sentinel Range, as far east as the [[~VostokHills~]] and the [[Volta]] river valley, and as far south as the [[Semb]] and the higher ground around the headwaters of the [[Wistel]]. 

On the shores of the Western Gulf, the ancient mariner culture has built [[Tollen]], and is an important cultural presence along the shores and river valleys of the Volta and Teft and increasingly, the Semb. 

In Tyrwingha - who knows. Not clear if there are people and if so, where they came from. Leave open for now. Perhaps it is a fey kingdom on earth.

## The Downfall and Rebirth

During the Downfall Wars, the region is transformed, as the great lizardfolk and elven kingdoms collapse, and the waterways shift and oceans change. Many lizardfolk and elves die, and many humans as well. By the end of the Downfall Wars, the lizardfolk remain only in some scattered settlements along the river deltas, and the elves only in Orenlas. Much of the rest of the land is depopulated, although substantial groups of the Zimka culture survive in the mountain slopes, as do substantial dwarven kingdoms beneath the Sentinels. 

Tyrwingha also exists in some form at this point, under the protection of Ethlenn already, which probably dates to the Downfall Wars. 

Over the next several hundred years, the Skaer Empire grows and is a major influence along the coast and river valleys, and in the southlands, along the Enst and upper Wistel, and as far south as the Mostreve Hills, the Zimka people spread. Along the coast and the Semb river, an intermixed culture ruled by the Skaer develops, although it does not spread as far south as Tyrwingha. 

## Coming of Drankor
In the 300s, the Drankorians reach the [[Mostreve Hills]], and over the next 50 years or so the Drankorians assimilate the inland people of [[Sembara]] (mostly the Zimka who had spread south) and push the Skaer out, bringing with them the [[Mos Numena]] and the traditions of their vast southern empire. 

Over the next 700 years, Drankor rules all the lands between the [[Sentinel Range]] and the [[Western Gulf]] south of the [[Semb]]. North of the [[Semb]], Drankor ruled the the region south and west of the [[Volta]], as far north as the [[Braebein]]. This includes the modern day [[Sembara]], [[Ardlas]], [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], [[Addermarch]], and [[Tyrwingha]] which are all broadly ruled as "the Sembaran Provinces" and grow to share a Mos Numena worshipping culture and a common language. 

On the borders of Drankor are the Zimka people, to the north along the Sentinel Range as far east as [[~VostokHills~]], and the Free City of Tollen. Beyond Tollen are the (undefined here) people of Vostok, who are clustered mostly along the coast. The part of Vostok just to the east of the Volta, in particular, is ill-defined in this history, and seems like it needs some consideration: is the Zimka region more of just the upper Volta, and peter out before the western slopes of the [[~VostokHills~]], or are the true Vostok people mostly on the eastern side of the [[~VostokHills~]]. 

%% I prefer the second, as it feels a bit more "sensible" from a dividing standpoint, and makes the upper Volta the center of Zimka culture %%

## Fall of Drankor
The Fall of Drankor brings chaos and disruption: both Skaer raiders from the east and plague from the south. When the dust settles, the six duchies that eventually form Sembara are well established, largely the inheritances of ancient Drankorian provinces. This is probably also the period when Tyrwingha establishes its traditions, including the Oracle of the Riven. 

Not considered here are the southern stretches such as Maseau and Addermarch. But I think these are probably more marginal lands, less fertile and harder to farm, and many people retreat from these lands to richer soils in the valleys during the chaos and collapse of Drankor -- more to the south towards Isingue than to the north.

The [[Timeline of Sembaran History]] tells a story about conquest in Zimka, but I no longer really like that history. I think instead it is more satisfying to just have depopulation and retreat.
