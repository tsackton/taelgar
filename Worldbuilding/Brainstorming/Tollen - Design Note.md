**The 17 Wards of Tollen**
 
**[on the south side of the Volta, much less developed]**
 
1. **[[Battery]]:** district 1, south side of the Volta, notable for the river fortifications that protect the main harbor; not densely populated, although small naval docks and barracks are here. Mostly dates to the 5600s/5700s, replacing many iterations of older fortications.
 
1. **Southbridge**: west part of district 8, the area south of the bridge, center of dyeing trade now, and home to most of the tattoo parlors (magical or otherwise) in the city. While the bridge is extremely old, dating to Drankorian era, this district has only been part of city since the early 5400s, although built on reclaimed land created during the Drankorian days.
 
1. **Fenslane:** east part of district 8, along the bend in the river, former tidal marshland reclaimed and settled mostly by dyers, tanners, and other similar artisans expanding from Southbridge. Reasonably new. 3. **Tideswell:** east of Fenslane, marshy area that floods on the high tide, mix of poorer/slums and lizardfolk communities.     
**[on the north side of the Volta, main part of the city]**
 
1. **Skepwalk:** Name derives from old Eastros word for docks; this is the westernmost ward on the north side of the river, and among the oldest docks and shipyards in the city. Now a major shipbuilding center.
 
1. **Guildgate**: East and north of Skepwalk, around the Guild Gate and home to many of the city's richest and most powerful merchant guilds and families. Dotted with extensive and ancient palaces of merchant houses.
 
1. **Fairgate:** North of Guildgate, inland from the Volta. Halfling neighborhood, sometimes split into Fairgate Inner (inside walls) and Fairgate Outer (outside walls).
 
1. **[[Brooklawn]]:** East of Fairgate, a swampy and wet area where the [[Little River]] was dammed and diverted to the east. Also often separated into Brooklawn Inner (inside the walls) and Brooklawn Outer (outside the walls). Fairly poor, slummy area. Brooklawn Outer is where much of the leatherworking and tanning happens, so smelly. Tanner's Gate separates Brooklawn Inner and Brooklawn Outer, and Brooklawn Inner is also referred to as Tannersgate.
 
1. **Bridgeward:** North of the Tollen Bridge, houses the largest market of the city.
 
1. **Fiskurth:** Name derives from old Eastros for fish, one of the oldest districts in the city dating to the pre-Drankorian era, although little is preserved of that time. Many taverns, entertainment, artisans, shops. Bustling center of Tollen. East of Bridgeward along the river.
 
1. **[[Aesganstrad]]:** Name derives from Aesgan, a semi-mythical Skaegish hero who is said to have protected/resettled Tollen during the chaos after the Downfall. East and south along the river from Fiskurth, and with Fiskurth and Skepwalk the ancient core of the city. Best preserved of the ancient districts, now home to many of the craft guilds, especially the powerful dyer's guild.
 
1. **[[Nordgate]]:** North of [[Aesganstrad]], around the original north gate of Tollen, west of the university and the temple district. Now one of the major dwarven districts in the city.
 
1. **Godshome:** east of [[Nordgate]], along Temple Street where many different houses of worship to different gods are found.
 
1. **Magus Street:** near Godshome, where the University of Tollen is located, also the scholar's gate. Often just called Magus. 3. **Gold Street:** east along the river from [[Aesganstrad]]. Home to banks. 5. **Riversgate:** furthest east district, along the river. Also separated into Inner and Outer, with Riversgate Outer a center of timber trade coming down the Volta.
    
1. **Haurhill:** rise of land, name means "hill hill" in Eastros and Westros. Height of land within Tollen and site of early fortifications.
   

**[bridges]**
 
**Tollen Bridge:** the ancient Drankorian bridge, still standing, with a huge stone drawbridge in the middle, marks the height of navigation of tall-masted sailing ships up the Volta. Runs from [north] to Southbridge.
 
**Aegans Bridge**: a newer bridge build to connect Aeganstrad with Fenslane.
   

**[gates]**
 
[from west to east}
 
Guild Gate, Fair Gate, Tanner's Gate, North Gate, Temple Gate, Scholar's Gate, River Gate
         

Tollen


- Masters of the Western Gulf. Significant fishing and merchant fleet. Strongest navy in the Western Gulf and major fishing industry (whales? Cod? Not sure what the key fish would be. Also no lenten red meat rules to drive a cash crop fish industry, so maybe not quite as developed as say the Basque medieval fisherman who got rich on cod)
- Controls a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the Volta as well as the Tollen city proper, and the coastal islands in the greater Tollen harbor.
- Controls the Straits of Cymea, main seafarers in the Western Gulf
- Manufacturing esp of clothes key. Silk (or cotton or a made up fiber) from Tyrwingha and wool from Sembara comes to the Tollen + northlands region to turn into fine clothes==
- Big dye industry in the hinterlands
- Influential in the northlands more than anywhere else and somewhat culturally connected to that region (although with a clear, distinct identity)
- Some significant far eastern trade, although that in general is probably more halfling/Cymean; Tollen is however a major market for Cymea traders, who exchange goods from around the Green Sea for Sembaran/Tollen cloth/silk/clothes.
- University in Tollen is major center of magical learning in the Sembara/Vostok region, only some parts of Cymea could compete in western Green Sea area. Dye industry + magic makes Tollen a center of development of magical tattoos.
- In many ways more cosmopolitan than Sembara; significant local halfling and dwarven communities, and stoneborn are not unheard of. Elves still super-rare, and lizardfolk if anything less common than in Sembara.
 
Along the northeastern border of the Kingdom of Sembara runs the mighty Volta River, dividing Sembara from Vostok, a land of many rivers, bitter winters, and small kingdoms. At the mouth of the Volta sits the Free City of Tollen, an independent city-state known for its merchant guilds, scholarship, wizards, and free-wheeling culture, a blend of the fierce independence of the Skaer, the ancient learning of Drankor, and the commercial and mercantile prowess of the Sembaran Northlands.  
 
Has various connections to Sembaran monarchy via rich merchants
   

**VERY ROUGH HISTORY**
 
Tollen was originally founded on the north bank of the Volta river by the first mariner migrants from Hkar, before the Downfall, in the year 3902 by the Dwarven reckoning. Originally something of a backwater at the far eastern edge of the Green Sea, over the next 100 years it became a center of commerce and trade, and a place where the mariner culture, the northern culture of the highlands, and the non-humans (lizardfolk and halflings, mostly) of the western Green sea mingled. Even in this early age, Tollen was a religiously open and cosmopolitan place, and the worship of \<OceanGod\> coexisted with the developing Kestavan tradition.
 
In 4050s, the Downfall Wars begin, and Tollen is cut off from the eastern Green Sea as long voyages become too dangerous and the ocean itself turns violent as storms wrack the seas and the great swamps to the south start to dry.
 
Cities become dangerous and by 4122 when the Downfall Wars have ended, Tollen is virtually abandoned, and the land that will become Sembara depopulated, settled by scattered villages of farmers, with Embry and a few other river towns among the only significant population settlements.
 
By the 4200s, the Skaer have established themselves as the dominant mariner culture in the western Green Sea, and resettle Tollen. Over the next 300 years, the Skaer grow stronger, spreading along the coast as far south as the mouth of the Semb, raiding upriver for timber and impressed sailors to row their great ships, and seeking converts for their religion. Tollen develops as a major trade center for the emerging Skaer empire, and begins to grow again.
 
In 4491, the Drankorians reach the Mostreve Hills, and over the next 50ish years the Drankorians assimilate the inland people of Sembara and push the Skaer out, bringing with them the Mos Numena and the Drankorian influence.
 
In 4547, the Drankorians and the Skaer sign a peace treaty, establishing the Volta as the frontier of the Drankorian Empire. Tollen, on the north side of the Volta, remains technically outside the Drankorian territorial claim. However, the Skaer are forbidden from bringing ships up the Volta, and Tollen falls outside their sway and comes under the influence of Drankor. While technically Tollen takes the name of the Free City of Tollen during this time, the Drankorian Empire controls its foreign policy as a protectorate.
 
By the 4600s, during the Long Peace, Tollen begins to assert more autonomy. By now it has become a mixing place of Drankorian, Skaer, and Highlander culture, with diverse religious practices and where many languages can be heard. During this era the first merchant houses are established, becoming rich off the trade of dyed cloth south to Drankor, and the development of magical tattoos, especially those that could help sailors control the wind and sea.
 
In the 4800s, as Drankorian expansion to the west begins in earnest and the might of the empire is focused to the east, the Tollen merchant houses have de facto control over Tollen, and Tollen has become a major city and one of the central mercantile powers of the western Green Sea. It is during this era that the University of Tollen is founded.
 
When the Plague strikes, while Tollen is spared the worst of the chaos that envelopes the south, but plenty of chaos remains, and various wars and conflicts spiral out of control. While the university survives, and the city itself, most of its wealth is lost as trade is disrupted, and Tollen falls into a dark age. Little is recorded from the time between the Plague in 5192, and the late 5300s, when the Sembaran kings begin to grow in power.
 
As Sembara expands in the south, Tollen recovers, and over the 5400s and 5500s Tollen experiences a renaissance of sorts, based on the growing wool and linen trade from the Sembaran heartlands. The lost art of magical tattoos are rediscovered and most of the merchant houses of Tollen today are established during this time period.
 
In the 5600s, war comes to the Green Sea, first the battles against the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and then the Great War itself. Tollen, however, survives intact, and if anything grows in power and influence, as many of the Sembaran kings in the years after the Great War have ties by blood or marriage to the great houses of Tollen.
 
Now, in 5881, Tollen commands a significant navy and is the undisputed master of the Western Gult, controlling the Straights of Cymea and asserting influence over much of western Cymea.
