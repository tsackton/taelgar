## Avatus Brainstorming (AI Summary)

Codex summary of all notes that mention Avatus. 

### Overview

- **Avatus** is described as an emperor who ruled an autocratic dominion on the southern edge of [[Sembara]] in the early 1400s DR, commonly called the **Dominion of Avatus** or **Domain of Avatus**.  
- His power base lay in and around the [[Mostreve Hills]], exerting overlordship over scattered baronies and small lordships, growing strong by taxing trade and recruiting large numbers of [[Hobgoblins]] as mercenaries and enforcers.  
- In Sembaran memory, he is the last major pre‑Derik I threat from the south: a conquering autocrat whose defeat by [[Derik I]] becomes the founding moment of “modern Sembara”.  
- He commissioned at least one major legendary artifact—the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]—via a powerful hobgoblin court wizard, tying his rule to planar and necromantic magic.  
- Later notes and chats sometimes spell his name **[[Avatus]]**; context makes clear this is the same figure as Avatus, though some of that material is explicitly tagged as older or non‑canonical.

### Geography & Extent of the Dominion

- **Core region.**  
  - Canonical timeline describes the **Dominion of Avatus** as exerting overlordship over scattered baronies and small lordships in the **[[Mostreve Hills]]**, strengthening itself by taxing overland trade and hiring hobgoblin mercenaries.  
    - Source: [[Timeline of Sembaran History]].  

- **Northern reach: Cleenseau and the Enst.**  
  - In the early 1420s, Avatus advances north to the [[Enst]] at [[Cleenseau]]. He captures the old Drankorian fort on the south bank, then uses **permanent dimension door magic** to move troops under the river into an underground staging area, outflanking Sembaran defenses.  
    - Sources: [[Cleenseau History Notes]], [[Hobgoblin Camp]].  
  - During the war, Cleenseau is captured and used as a **central staging point** in the campaign against Sembara. The population is “largely enslaved” rather than massacred; the **Stonebridge** halflings are allowed to keep running [[The Crossroads Inn]] as a hobgoblin watering hole and secretly aid human escapees through tunnels.  
    - Source: [[Cleenseau History Notes]], [[Discord Chat - Avatus and Hobgolbins]].  

- **Southern and eastern borders.**  
  - Broader historical notes place the Dominion south of Sembara, alongside the kingdom of [[Tyrwingha]], forming part of a ring of powers hemming in Sembara before Derik I’s rise (alongside [[Cymea]], [[Isingue]], [[Dunmar]], [[Chardon]] and the raiding [[Skaer]]).  
    - Sources: [[Avatus]], [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]], “GDrive - Sembara Document”.  
  - Chats suggest Avatus’s dominion may have stretched **from the mountains to Tyrwingha**, but its precise extent is deliberately left fuzzy for later refinement.  
    - Source: [[Discord Chat - History of Western Green Sea]].  

- **Addermarch’s position.**  
  - Later worldbuilding emphasizes [[Addermarch]] as a rough frontier that **resisted conquest**: repeatedly probed by Avatus but never fully subdued, serving as a base for guerrilla resistance and ranger traditions rather than a settled Avatus province.  
    - Sources: [[Discord Chat - Addermarch]], [[Discord Chat - History of Western Green Sea]].  
  - Earlier notes about “lands formerly controlled by Avatus” being reorganized into new Sembaran border duchies (e.g., [[Duchy of Maseau]]) may implicitly include or border Addermarch, but recent discussions lean toward Addermarch preserving a more independent history.  
    - Sources: [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], [[Discord Chat - Upper Istaros Region]].

### Government, Society, and Military

- **Regime type.**  
  - Avatus is consistently framed as a **military autocrat**—an emperor or dictator ruling a centralized dominion with a strong personal cult and tightly controlled subjects.  
    - Source: [[Avatus]], [[Tyrwingha - Ideas]], “GDrive - Sembara Document”.  
  - Hobgoblins form the backbone of his armies and administration, aligning with a broader setting idea of hobgoblins as authoritarian, hierarchical slavers who view humans as naturally subordinate.  
    - Sources: [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]], [[Discord Chat - Avatus and Hobgolbins]].  

- **Attitude toward population and slavery.**  
  - Cleenseau notes depict Avatus as **seeking conquest and subjects, not revenge**: populations that submit are largely enslaved and heavily taxed, not exterminated, because the regime values labor and agricultural productivity.  
    - Source: [[Cleenseau History Notes]].  
  - Resistance is met with brutality—enslavement, harsh control, and strategic terror—but the “default” occupation is harsh authoritarian rule rather than indiscriminate slaughter.  

- **Use of hobgoblins and werewolves.**  
  - Tyrwingha‑focused lore describes Avatus/[[Avatus]] commanding an army of **hobgoblins and vicious werewolves**, reinforcing his image as a warlord who mixes disciplined hobgoblin forces with supernatural shock troops.  
    - Source: [[Tyrwingha - Ideas]].  

- **New Drankorian emperor.**  
  - Secret lore for the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] calls Avatus “styling himself the **New Drankorian Emperor**,” explicitly linking his propaganda and legitimacy to the fallen [[Drankorian Empire]], even as Sembara is still absorbing Drankorian legacy.  
    - Sources: [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], [[Avatus]].  

### Magical Projects & the Court Wizard

#### Mirror of Soul Trapping

- **Commissioning.**  
  - About **150 years before the [[Great War]]** (i.e., roughly late 1300s to very early 1400s DR), Avatus commissions the **[[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]** from his **hobgoblin court wizard**, a powerful planar specialist adept at manipulating boundaries between worlds.  
    - Sources: [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] (SECRET block), [[Avatus]]
  - The mirror binds twelve extradimensional prison cells and becomes his preferred tool for **imprisoning dangerous enemies**, especially magic‑users he cannot trust in mundane prisons.  

- **Court wizard’s legacy.**  
  - The court wizard’s **apprentice** later steals the mirror after Avatus’s defeat at the hands of [[Derik I]], fleeing south with the artifact and other treasure.  
  - This apprentice founds a small hobgoblin “backwater slave empire” on the fringes of civilization, passing the mirror down a family line; her granddaughter **[[Revaka]]** eventually rules the remnant and is later trapped in the mirror herself by [[Cha'mutte]].  
    - Sources: [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] (SECRET), [[Revaka]].  
  - Revaka is explicitly noted as the **granddaughter of Avatus’s hobgoblin court wizard**, which ties the mirror and Revaka’s later micro‑kingdom directly to Avatus’s court.  

### Military Campaigns & the War with Sembara

#### Broad historical framing

- Global chronology:  
  - (CY:: 5562) – Defeat of Avatus and the founding of modern Sembara. This corresponds to roughly **(DR:: 1429)** via the Drankorian‑to‑Dwarven conversion.  
    - Source: [[Canonical Events]], [[Timeline of Sembaran History]].  
  - Sembara in this era is newly consolidating from post‑Drankor fragmentation; Avatus and Tyrwingha are the major southern powers constraining Sembaran expansion.  

#### Campaign timeline (Sembaran perspective)

From [[Timeline of Sembaran History]]:

- (DR:: 1422): Avatus conquers most of the **[[Duchy of Brovna]]**, but dwarven resistance (supported by [[Ardlas]]) keeps him from pushing north through mountain passes.  
- (DR:: 1425), summer: Avatus invades [[Sembara]].  
- (DR:: 1425), summer: He defeats the Sembaran army at the **[[Battle of Stavenford]]**.  
- (DR:: 1425), late fall: Sembaran forces abandon the lands between the [[Enst]] and [[Wistel]] rivers and retreat to [[Wisford]] for winter; Avatus consolidates gains.  
- (DR:: 1426), summer: [[Derik I]] returns with Tyrwinghan and Telhamite support, pushing Avatus south of the Wistel at the **[[Battle of Wisford]]**.  
- (DR:: 1427), summer: Derik pushes Avatus south of the Enst at the **[[Battle of Fellburn]]**.  
- (DR:: 1428), spring–summer: Derik campaigns south of the Enst, carrying the war into former Avatus territory.  
- (DR:: 1429), spring: Derik defeats Avatus at the decisive **[[Battle of Dalfield]]**.  
- (DR:: 1429), late fall: The **[[Treaty of Wisford]]** formalizes Derik’s new order, codifying modern Sembara and cementing the [[House of Sewick]] as rulers of the joined crowns of Sembara, [[Tyrwingha]], and [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]].  
- (DR:: 1430), summer–fall: Derik campaigns in the [[Mostreve Hills]] and signs the **[[Treaty of Valarin]]** with the emergent [[Istabor Alliance]], setting Sembara’s southern frontier at the edge of Avatus’s former dominion.  
- (DR:: 1432): Derik formally establishes new border polities—[[Duchy of Maseau]], [[Barony of Aveil]], [[Barony of Dunfry]], and the [[Marches of Enford|Barony of Enford]]—in lands previously controlled by Avatus and restores [[Duchy of Brovna|Brovna]].  

#### Tyrwinghan & prophetic narrative

- A more mythic account in [[Tyrwingha - Ideas]] (and older “GDrive – Sembara Document”) presents Avatus/[[Avatus]] as a **military dictator ravaging Sembara** with hobgoblins and werewolves while prophets in Tyrwingha proclaim looming End Times.  
- The Sembaran dukes’ pleas for aid are initially ignored; Tyrwingha’s queen is paralyzed by prophetic nightmares of her realm’s downfall if she intervenes.  
- Into this crisis rides **Derik I**, already a minor hero from pirate skirmishes, who receives a prophecy from a **lizardfolk elder**: if he does not overthrow **Avatus**, the “smallest cloud in the coming storm,” future horrors will be much worse.  
- When Derik lands in Tyrwingha, the Archfey **[[Ethlenn]]** appears, blesses him, and endorses him as king; his subsequent victory over Avatus and the Treaty of Wisford become the basis for the **unification of the crowns** of Sembara, Tyrwingha, and Telham.  

#### Cleenseau‑specific events

- In [[Cleenseau History Notes]]:  
  - Avatus sacks the Drankorian tower on the south bank of the Enst in the early 1420s, breaking its longstanding magical protections.  
  - He uses a **dimension door link** from the captured fort to an underground staging area under the north bank, enabling surprise attacks behind Sembaran lines and contributing to the defeat at Stavenford.  
  - During occupation (DR 1425–1427), Cleenseau serves as a major logistics hub and base for Avatus’s army.  
  - The halfling Stonebridges negotiate an uneasy accommodation, running [[The Crossroads Inn]] under hobgoblin oversight while secretly maintaining tunnels to help humans escape.  

#### Cha'mutte’s role

- Older texts (e.g., **[[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]]**) describe [[Cha'mutte]] as the **hidden puppet master** behind the Dominion of Avatus, who, after Avatus’s defeat, shifts his attention north and eventually triggers the [[Great War]].  
- Later Discord chats suggest Avatus was **not explicitly allied** with Cha'mutte and that Cha'mutte was not yet punishing hobgoblins for refusing to serve, implying a more indirect or background influence.  
  - Sources: [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]], [[Discord Chat - Avatus and Hobgolbins]], [[Discord Chat - Sembara History]].  

### Legacy & Remnants

- **Political restructuring.**  
  - Derik I’s post‑war reforms carve Avatus’s former territories into new duchies and baronies (notably [[Duchy of Maseau]]), placing them under more directly crown‑controlled lords and drastically reshaping the political map south of Sembara.  
    - Source: [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]].  

- **Cultural echo.**  
  - In later centuries, “Avatus” functions as a shorthand for a brutal hobgoblin‑backed autocrat. Places like Maseau and Aurbez are described as being **resettled** after the Dominion’s defeat, with pre‑Avatus political structures largely irrelevant to later history.  
    - Sources: [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], “GDrive – Sembara Document”, [[Discord Chat - Upper Istaros Region]].  

- **Military and hobgoblin remnants.**  
  - After Avatus’s fall, hobgoblin remnants—some loyal, some opportunistic—persist along the southern [[Sentinel Range]] and nearby Plaguelands, occasionally forming warbands that menace Sembara until the Great War and subsequent Blood Years reshape the region.  
    - Sources: [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]], [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]].  
  - Survivors of Avatus’s armies provide the backdrop for later hobgoblin conflicts (e.g., the [[Shattered Ice Clan]], the [[Bloodlust Wars]], and the northern/southern hobgoblin armies of the Great War).  

- **Magical relics and infrastructure.**  
  - The **Mirror of Soul Trapping** passes out of Avatus’s direct control with his defeat but continues to influence history for centuries through Revaka’s line and later through [[Agata]] in the Dunmari campaigns.  
    - Sources: [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], [[Revaka]], [[Dunmar Fellowship Associates]].  
  - The **Avatus tunnels** and lair beneath the Drankorian fort at Cleenseau remain dangerous centuries later, serving as the origin point of an undead plague awakened by a lich‑king in the Cleenseau campaign.  
    - Sources: [[Hobgoblin Camp]], [[Cleenseau History Notes]], “discord-dm-log-through-20250116 – Avatus dimension door discussion”.  

- **Addermarch & ranger traditions.**  
  - Discussion notes suggest the **rangers of Addermarch** may trace some of their origins to guerrilla fighters who resisted Avatus in the hills, contributing to the region’s identity as stubbornly unconquered highlands.  
    - Source: [[Discord Chat - Addermarch]].

### Timeline of Events (Avatus‑related)

Approximate, focusing on Avatus and his dominion rather than later mirror history.

- **Pre‑1420s DR (brainstormed):** Avatus, a rising warlord‑emperor on Sembara’s southern border, consolidates control over scattered hill baronies, builds a hobgoblin‑heavy army, and commissions the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]  via his hobgoblin court wizard.  
- **(DR:: 1420)** – [[Derik I]] marries into the [[Duchy of Telham]], beginning his rise in Sembaran politics.  
- **(DR:: 1422)** – Avatus conquers most of [[Duchy of Brovna]] but fails to break through dwarven defenses; at roughly the same time, Derik distinguishes himself in the [[Castrota Pirate War]].  
- **Early 1420s** – Avatus sacks the Drankorian tower at [[Cleenseau]] and establishes a dimension‑door‑linked lair beneath the fort, using it to project force north of the [[Enst]].  
  - Source: [[Cleenseau History Notes]], [[Hobgoblin Camp]].  
- **(DR:: 1425)** – Avatus invades Sembara, defeating the royal army at [[Battle of Stavenford]]; Sembara retreats between the Enst and Wistel.  
- **(DR:: 1425–1426)** – Avatus occupies key southern Sembaran territories and consolidates; Cleenseau becomes a major staging base.  
- **(DR:: 1425–1426)** – Derik I receives prophecy, is crowned in [[Tyrwingha]] with Archfey [[Ethlenn]]’s blessing, and begins organizing a counter‑offensive (mythic account).  
  - Source: [[Tyrwingha - Ideas]].  
- **(DR:: 1426–1427)** – Derik wins the Battles of **Wisford** and **Fellburn**, pushing Avatus south of the Wistel and then the Enst.  
- **(DR:: 1428–1429)** – Derik carries the war into Avatus’s dominion; the Battle of **Dalfield** destroys Avatus’s field army and effectively ends his rule.  
- **(DR:: 1430–1432)** – Derik campaigns in the [[Mostreve Hills]], negotiates with the [[Istabor Alliance]], and formally reorganizes former Avatus territories into new duchies and baronies (Maseau, Aveil, Dunfry, Enford, restored Brovna).  
- **Post‑1430s** – Hobgoblin remnants settle in or near the southern [[Sentinel Range]]; Avatus’s court wizard’s line, via the stolen mirror, forms a minor hobgoblin kingdom on Dunmar’s fringes (later ruled by [[Revaka]]).  
- **Later centuries** – Avatus’s dominion becomes a historical reference point for Sembaran border politics and for the origins of certain hobgoblin enclaves and artifacts, but no direct successor state emerges.  

### Possible Inconsistencies / Conflicts

- **Name: [[Avatus]] vs [[Avatus]].**  
  - Older documents and chats use **[[Avatus]]**; newer notes, person records, and timelines use **Avatus**. The overlap of dates, events, and relationships (e.g., hobgoblin court wizard, war with Derik I) makes it clear these are intended to be the same figure.  
  - Implication: treat [[Avatus]] spelling as legacy/variant; Avatus is the canonical form going forward.  ***RESOLVED BY MERGING FILES AND AUTO-RENAME***

- **Species and nature.**  
  - [[Avatus]] currently lists him as a human emperor, but internal DM commentary leaves this open, with some preference for a **hobgoblin** or more unusual origin to make him stand out.  
  - Chat notes explicitly suggest making him “a bit more unique/powerful” than a generic hobgoblin or human without fully defining his nature.  
  - Implication: species is intentionally ambiguous; many NPCs might disagree about whether he was human, hobgoblin, or something else.  

- **Relationship to Cha'mutte.**  
  - [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]] calls Cha'mutte the **“hidden puppet master”** of the Dominion of Avatus, whose defeat pushes Cha'mutte to refocus on the north.  
  - Discord discussions, however, emphasize that Avatus **was not explicitly allied** with Cha'mutte, and that Cha'mutte was not yet punishing hobgoblins who refused to join him during the Domain of [[Avatus]] period.  
  - Implication: canon can treat Cha'mutte’s influence as **indirect**—perhaps cults or advisors linked to him operate within the Dominion—while Avatus himself remains a separately motivated autocrat.  

- **Cleenseau’s fate under Avatus.**  
  - [[Cleenseau History Notes]] describes the town as captured, with the population largely enslaved but not massacred; the halfling Stonebridges cut a deal with Avatus.  
  - Some older chats briefly floated the idea that Avatus might not sack Cleenseau at all but instead have an uneasy truce; those were later folded back into the “captured but not annihilated” version now recorded in the history note.  
  - Implication: treat Cleenseau History Notes as canonical; chat alternatives are superseded.  

- **Addermarch’s status.**  
  - The Sembaran timeline speaks broadly of “lands formerly controlled by Avatus” being reorganized into duchies (including [[Duchy of Maseau]]), which might suggest more extensive conquest.  
  - More recent Addermarch‑specific brainstorming strongly prefers that **Addermarch was never fully conquered**, instead serving as a hard‑to‑subdue frontier and guerrilla theater.  
  - Implication: Avatus likely **threatened and invaded** parts of Addermarch’s periphery but never established stable dominion over its core hills.  

- **Mirror and Vault chronology.**  
  - The Mirror’s secret origin text places its commission “about 150 years before the Great War,” which, depending on conversion, can be read as **late 1300s DR**, slightly earlier than the DR 1420s start date given for Avatus’s dominion.  
  - Implication: magical projects’ timelines are approximate; a reasonable synthesis is that Avatus began commissioning major works a few decades before his open campaigns in Sembara.  

- **Werewolves and supernatural troops.**  
  - [[Tyrwingha - Ideas]] emphasizes werewolves as a distinctive part of [[Avatus]]’s army; more recent summaries of the Dominion focus primarily on hobgoblins and generic “vicious forces.”  
  - Implication: werewolves can be treated as a **regional/folk emphasis** in Tyrwingha’s oral traditions rather than a universally remembered fact.  

### Open Questions

- **What exactly was Avatus?**  
  - Human, hobgoblin, something else, or a hybrid? Was “Emperor” a title granted by followers, or did he claim a more esoteric origin tied to Drankor or even to embodied gods?  

- **Full extent of the Dominion.**  
  - How far east and west did Avatus’s overlordship run beyond the Mostreve Hills? Did he directly control regions that later become [[Duchy of Maseau]] and parts of [[Istabor Alliance]], or were some only tributary?  

- **Capital and major strongholds.**  
  - Where was Avatus’s main capital? The Cleenseau lair and mirror‑holding dungeon are significant, but presumably not his principal palace. A named capital and seat of power are still undefined.  

- **Court wizard’s identity.**  
  - The hobgoblin court mage is currently unnamed. Defining their name, personality, and broader works (other artifacts, rituals, seer contacts) would clarify Avatus‑era lore and Revaka’s ancestry.  

- **Connection to Avatus‑era cursed items.**  
  - Several cursed artifacts in Addermarch (e.g., **serpentine weapons** recovered from Avatus tombs) may be relics of his regime or earlier Drankorian experiments co‑opted by his dominion. To what extent were these weapons part of a deliberate program (e.g., a “serpentine armory”) versus isolated creations?  

- **Cha'mutte’s influence on Avatus’s rise.**  
  - If Cha'mutte is not directly allied with Avatus, did he manipulate events from afar, seed cults within Avatus’s ranks, or simply take advantage of the aftermath of Avatus’s fall?  

- **Addermarch’s internal history during the wars.**  
  - What specific campaigns, sieges, and guerrilla actions took place in Addermarch during the Avatus wars? How did those shape current ranger orders, noble houses, and haunted sites?  

### Notes on Sources

- **More canonical / up‑to‑date:**  
  - [[Timeline of Sembaran History]] – main high‑level chronology for Avatus and Derik I.  
  - [[Cleenseau History Notes]] – detailed account of Cleenseau during Avatus’s wars.  
  - [[Avatus]] – basic biographical sketch, including “New Drankorian Emperor” flavor.  
  - [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] & [[Revaka]] – detailed backstory of Avatus’s court wizard, the mirror’s creation, and its post‑Avatus history.  

- **Older or explicitly provisional:**  
  - [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]] – superseded in places by Timeline of Sembaran History but still useful for flavor (especially Cha'mutte as puppet‑master).  
  - [[Tyrwingha - Ideas]] and “GDrive – Sembara Document” – mythic narrative of [[Avatus]]/Avatus and Derik I, strong on Tyrwinghan perspective and prophecy but written as brainstorming.  
  - [[Discord Chat - Avatus and Hobgolbins]], [[Discord Chat - Sembara History]], [[Discord Chat - Addermarch]], [[Discord Chat - History of Western Green Sea]] – rich for intent and vibe, but not always aligned with later writeups; good guidance for tone and unresolved questions.

## Important Canonical Points

Trying to consolidate a few canonical facts that are critical to preserve in any redeveloped history of Avatus:

- Avatus had a strong connection to arcane magic via a powerful hobgoblin court wizard, who crafted at least one powerful magic item (the Mirror of Soul Trapping), and likely others including cursed items/relics that have appeared in Addermarch (serpentine dagger, serpentine battle axe) and Cleenseau (orb of zombie creation) campaigns. 
- Avatus attacks Sembara in DR 1420s, and conquers Cleenseau, which he rules from DR 1425 - DR 1427
- Derik I defeats Avatus in DR 1427 and forges modern Sembara in the aftermath of victory 
- Avatus occupies the Enst river valley, the Duchy of Masseau, and likely parts of Andonne and Aurbez though this is less clear
- Avatus invades but does not occupy Addermarch, though the exact details are not yet established. The key canonical vibe is that battles were fought in land that is now Addermarch, and some places may have been temporarily occupied, but Adderfell was never conquered and Addermarch as a whole did not fall to Avatus. At least the western frontier has to have some battle sites. 
- Avatus never conquers Tyrwingha, and presumably never makes it north of the Wistel, though whether the northern extent of Avatus' reach is strictly canonical and established in-game is not entirely clear. 
- Avatus never conquers Isingue

Some things that are consistent in notes but might not be canonical, depending on what has been introduced in play:

- Many notes suggest Avatus conquered much of what is now the western marches of Sembara, potentially as far north as the southern borders of Ardlas along the [[Bollin]]. Unclear whether this is necessary to support details introduced in play or whether this is a historical invention. 
- Several notes mention werewolves as a major force in Avatus' armies, potentially suggesting a connection to Jinnik and Pandemonium. This is likely a remnant from early "modern era" worldbuilding when Cha'mutte was still conceptualized as connected to Pandemonium, due to his origin as a werewolf in the high school campaign who turned into a cool enough villain to be retconned into something more elaborate.
