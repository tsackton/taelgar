# The West Coast

Major features include a major river, large forests to the east against the ~CentralMountains~, a large lake on the main river north of Chardon, a significant peninsula extending into the Endless Ocean south of Chardon, and several island systems and a large bay in the north. In the far north, a chain of volcanoes extends from the central mountains, and the land becomes mountainous and covered in glaciers approaching and beyond the arctic circle. The climate is mild, with wet winters and dry summers; pleasant year round temperatures to the south; cold, snowy winters to the north; and significant coastal moderation on the many islands and peninsulas of this region.
 

Population centers in this region include the Chardonian Empire, where the great bulk of the humans live; Illoria, a land of refugees and pirates on the islands in Nevos Bay, south of Chardon; ~Peninsula~, a ~???~; ~WesternIslands~, a ~????~; ~NorthernBay~, where the largest concentration of the original “west northlanders” who still live on the mainland live; ~FormerlyPandarRegion~, a now-ruined but once dominant empire around and north of the volcanic mountains in the far north, including a few smaller polities like Volkrad that were allied against Pandar; ~ArcticTribes~, ~???~; and possibly other places. 

### Chardonian Empire

#### Chardon

- Huge city, with significant hinterlands near the mouth of ~MainWestRiver~
    
- Mostly on south bank; north bank poorer, chalyte refineries on north bank, power magic item industry in Chardon
    
- Large, anomalous extinct volcano on north bank
    
- Heir to imperial Drankor, now capitol of a growing Empire stretching north and south
    
- Great Library major center of learning and magic in Taelgar
    
- Hinterlands small farms in river valley and south to forest edge and the hills around small river
    

#### North Chardon Coast

- Needs a name - long stretch of smooth sandy beaches running 800 miles north of Chardon
    
- Sandy beaches, leading to land of rivers and farms and pastures, breadbasket of Chardon
    
- Small stands of ancestral forests but mostly land with a long history of agriculture
    
- Land slopes up to low hills maybe 150-200 miles inland
    
- Relatively few big cities; perhaps one or two in the north? Not sure yet about urbanization in this area.
    
- Parts of this were once prosperous Northlander/Drankorian kingdoms, wiped out in Great War and/or quickly conquered by Chardon
    

#### Great Chardon Forest

- Needs a name - very large forest between the ~MainRiver~ and the ~CentralMountains~
    
- Only western edge really settled, and the area between the two forks of ~MainRiver~, which is really part of the Chardonian hinterlands
    
- Interior of forest (along south fork of ~MainRiver~) weird and magical, not settled by humans, at least not Chardonians
    

#### Emerald Coast

- Needs a name, maybe. Coast of the Emerald bay, southwest of Chardon. 
    
- Ancient, magical canal cuts through narrow part of the isthmus, allowing seagoing travel, but expensive to navigate for ~to be determined reasons~
    
- Large southern port/trading city, one of the 2-3 largest in Chardon Empire outside Chardon
    
- The northern slopes of the ~CoastalMountains~ are another significant mining area.
    

#### Lizardfolk River Basin

- Southern river has several large lizardfolk communities that operate somewhat outside the strictures of the Empire
    
- Border area between Chardon and Dunmar on road to Songara is pretty wild; known as the Myraeni Gap, it is rough, hilly land that has traditionally been under the control of the Myraenians, a mysterious and closed society; in the modern era, they have retreated a bit and kobolds are a serious nuisance here
    
- Marshy lowlands along ~LizardFolk River~ is in many ways the effective southwestern border of the Empire, as much of this terrain is a mire of swamps, lizardfolk settlements, and confusing waterways that are hard to cross and navigate. Trade routes tend to run along eaves of the forest, and the old Drankorian bridges no longer span the river.
    

#### Northern Frontier

- North of the ~GreatChardonLake~, settlement density drops considerably, and area has a more ‘frontier’ feel
    
- Around Voltara -- northernmost big city in the Empire -- is a notable settlement, with an economy powered by chalyte mines in the northern mountains, which provides incredible value and wealth when sold south
    
- Endless Ocean coast west of Voltara some settlement. 
    
- Most trade either goes south along river (not consistently navigable above the lake, though), or west to coast/overland to north of ~NorthChardonCoast~, then south by ship.
    
- All of this area was once small kingdoms, often mix of Drankor/Northlander heritage, that were essentially completely wiped out by Pandor/hobgoblins/Cha’mutte in the post-Great-War period
    
- Beyond here, land of orcs and hobgoblins; this area was generally reclaimed in the past 100-150 years, after Blood Years, so Chardon was pushed back, and then pushed forward
       


### ~Peninsula~

- Possible location for half-elfs (peronar)
    

### ~NorthBay~

### ~FormerlyPandarRegion~

### ~ArcticTribes~  

# The Green Sea

The Green Sea stretches from the far east to the middle of the continent. To the west, major features are the Cymean peninsula and the islands north and south, including Skaegenland, as well as the Mostreve hills in southern Sembara, and the ~VostokMountains~. In the center and east, major features include a large island centrally located in the middle of the Green Sea, and a large, dense archipelago blocking the mouth of the Green Sea from the Endless Ocean. While the west is densely settled, in the east, along both coasts, most people live close to the ocean: in the north, due to the increasing cold and snow; in the south, the encroaching desert.

  

Population centers in the Western Green Sea include: Greater Sembara, the Cymean peninsula, Greater Vostok (including the Skaer islands), and the center river valley, including ~Irebor~ and ~SouthCymea~.

  

Population centers in the Eastern Gree Sea include: ~NorthCoast~, ~Big Island~, ~EasternDunmari~, ~FarNorthPeninsula~, ~EntranceIslands~, and ~EastCoast~.

  

## Climatology Overview

The Green Sea forms a rough triangle, with the western point at about 40 degrees North, and the eastern edges stretching from roughly 60 degrees North to roughly 30 degrees North. The Green Sea is split into eastern and western halves, divided by ~BigIsland~.

  

In the winter, a zone of high pressure tends to sit over the southernmost parts of the Green Sea (from about 30 N - 35 N), causing light and variable trade winds south of the ~BigIsland~, and a dry climate with little precipitation, while strong westerlies blow north of about 35 N. 

  

In the summer, the land to the west heats up and the zone of high pressure shifts polarward. In the western Green Sea, a monsoon wind blows from the east, bringing summer rains to Sembara and Vostok, while in the east, light and variable winds shift northward. In the south, the powerful trade winds blow from the open ocean to the east. 

  

Consequences for trade: sailing east in the northern section of the Green Sea is easy in winter, while sailing west in the southern and western parts are easy in summer. Historically/real world, the distances are kind of on par with the Indian Ocean trade. 

  

In the west, the climate is dominated by the summer monsoons, which brings moisture-laden air and spring/summer rains, getting increasing dry moving south from the Cymean peninsula. 

  

The ~BigIsland~ has a climate not dissimilar to Japan, with the summer monsoon bringing rain to the southeastern side of the island and the winter westerlies bringing snow to the northwestern side of the island. 

  

The South Coast, from ~SouthCymea~ all the way east, tends to be dry, with a climate reminiscent of North Africa “between the mountains,” with almost no rain; only ~SouthCymea~ itself trends towards a humid subtropical climate (perhaps Pampas-like). The exception is the far east, east of the mountains, which is much more influenced by the Endless Ocean than the Green Sea, and has a much wetter and warmer climate influenced by the warm currents and prevailing trade wind of the Endless Ocean. 

  

The climate of the western islands is highly varied, being strongly oceanic and influenced by the Green Sea, the Endless Ocean, and magic. 

  

The North Coast around Skaegenland is heavily maritime, reminiscent of Nova Scotia/Scandinavia, which continues east to the southernmost extend of the North Coast. The northeastern coast, however, is much colder, more reminiscent of eastern Siberia, with long winters and short summers, although the maritime influence moderates the seasonality. 

## The Western Green Sea

### Greater Sembara

#### Sembara

- Inward agricultural focus. Sphere of influence pushing more west and interior than into the Western Gulf - limited or no real navy, small scale fishing but not a major part of the culture or economy (think China)
    
- Trade devalued -- historical analog: ancient Rome, where wealth from land was much more significant than wealth from trade
    
- Very fertile soil and rich agricultural harvests in the heart of Sembara drive the economy. Major exporter of foodstuffs and raw materials. Also higher population density than anywhere else between the good soil and the miracle that the heartland of Sembara has never been overrun by anything too bad since even before the Drankorians relatively gently took over
    
- Landed barons and dukes dominate local politics
    
- Very good relationship with halflings, who are the favored traders, and have formal rights of free passage and access to markets across Sembara.
    
- Cooler relationship with dwarves -- not at all hostile, but dwarves are more aligned with the highland kingdoms, esp Ardlas and Lavnoch
    
- Close relationship with lizardfolk, who have played an outsized role in Sembara’s history and establishment of House of Sewick.
    
- Elves very rare in Sembara, with little direct political contacts; largest Elven settlement nearby is the semi-mythical kingdom of Orenlas in the forests surrounding a supposedly enchanted lake south/southeast of Tyrwingha in the Cymea foothills.
    
- Stoneborn are also very rare in Sembara; mostly in the high peaks north of Ulrich devastation; more common in Northlands than elsewhere, coming from the Vostok highlands
    

#### Tollen

- Masters of the Western Gulf. Significant fishing and merchant fleet. Strongest navy in the Western Gulf and major fishing industry (whales? Cod? Not sure what the key fish would be. Also no lenten red meat rules to drive a cash crop fish industry, so maybe not quite as developed as say the Basque medieval fisherman who got rich on cod)
    
- Controls a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the Volta as well as the Tollen city proper, and the coastal islands in the greater Tollen harbor.
    
- Controls the Straits of Cymea, main seafarers in the Western Gulf
    
- Manufacturing esp of clothes key. Silk (or cotton or a made up fiber) from Tyrwingha and wool from Sembara comes to the Tollen + northlands region to turn into fine clothes
    
- Big dye industry in the hinterlands
    
- Influential in the northlands more than anywhere else and somewhat culturally connected to that region (although with a clear, distinct identity)
    
- Some significant far eastern trade, although that in general is probably more halfling/Cymean; Tollen is however a major market for Cymea traders, who exchange goods from around the Green Sea for Sembaran/Tollen cloth/silk/clothes.
    
- University in Tollen is major center of magical learning in the Sembara/Vostok region, only some parts of Cymea could compete in western Green Sea area. Dye industry + magic makes Tollen a center of development of magical tattoos.
    
- In many ways more cosmopolitan than Sembara; significant local halfling and dwarven communities, and stoneborn are not unheard of. Elves still super-rare, and lizardfolk if anything less common than in Sembara.
    


### Vostok

#### South Vostok

- The southern part of Vostok, basically the hundred miles closest to the coast as well as a narrow band around the Kem (more eastern river) stretching somewhat north of where the Niva joins it, and also somewhat along the Niva
    
- Key political organization around a set of chieftains of clans who control a central territory and some of the hinterlands - but some areas are overlapped between multiple chieftains and it isn’t a land of clear regional boundaries (inspired by the Mandala political model of south east asia -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala_(political_model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala_(political_model)) ). The idea is not really borders, a set of related clans/tribes/chieftains/kingdoms whatever with overlapping circles of influence
    
- Name: refered to as South Vostok or South Vosland in Sembara
    
- Minimal roads - some rough roads along the coast but communication can be slow except by sea / river. 
    
- Lots of uninhabited land, even within the more organized territories around each of the major tribes/clans/chiefs
    
- I was also looking at the middle African Hausa Kingdoms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_Kingdoms)  for inspiration
    
- Some of the larger tribes might recognize Cymea as a overlord type, but little meaning to that outside of perhaps some annual tribute (sailors for the navy?) and a personal relationship between the chief and the Cymean leader (common pattern in south asia vis-a-vie China) 
    

#### North Vostok

- Very few people
    
- Culturally connected to the Zovcka more than anywhere else, but long sundered, and not a lot of people go back and forth through the lakes region
    
- Lakes region probably mostly uninhabited or entirely uninhabited -- the people of North Vostok are mostly clustered around the big lake in the center of Vostok and the eastern slopes of the central volcanic mountains
    
- Some ancient connection to the folks who built the big wall in the north
    

#### Skaegenland

- Ancient sea-faring people, culturally and linguistically distinct, although related to ancient inhabitants of Tyrwingha and Sembara before Drankor
    
- Distinct religion derived from original Hkaran mariner pantheon
    
- Loosely Viking based, but should blend in some other influences to make them more interesting
    
- Politically disorganized, perhaps slightly theocratic or perhaps full fledged theocracy
    

#### ~KenkuHomeland~

- North of the Vostok wall, cold dry steppe
    
- New homeland of Kenku
    

### Cymea

#### Cymea

- A collection of city states, not fully united, but with a dominant one, probably somewhere in the south-east (perhaps near the more southerly river in the main part of the penisula), or perhaps even on the big island
    
- Inspired by Drankor -- would it make sense to have a leader styling themselves the Emperor of Cymea, in the same vein that a lot of historical figures styled themselves Roman Emperors long after Rome was gone (Byzantium parallel somewhere maybe?)
    
- Clear division between Western Cymea (see below) and the main eastern and southern lands
    
- Some significant influence towards Vostok and a major player on the wider Green Sea
    
- Maybe sees themselves as a bit ‘above’ the Western Gulf and Sembara and trades with them, but sees Sembara as an upstart (whereas Sembara probably sees Cymeans as fooling themselves and pretending to grandier they don’t have, but also, Sembara is more inward focused and is happy enough as long as folks buy their wheat -- the passion would be more to the west and south)
    

#### Western Cymea

- Scattered small fishing villages and isolated farmsteads in the hills -- limited political organization
    
- Haven for pirates during the Blood Years, cleaned up by Tollen during Cece’s reign (perhaps with overt or implicit support of Sembara)
    
- Perhaps now there is a Tollen military governor of some kind? Or Tollen is encouraging settlement there?
    
- Could have a heavy Tollen naval presence 
    

  

### ~River Valley~

#### ~SouthCymea~

- ??? Need to decide what this is
    

  

### ~EasternDunmari~

- Southeast of Cymea north of southern mountains inland of 
    
- Other branch of Dunmari migration, but only distant cultural ties, linked primarily by religion and language
    
- Now sedentary
    
- Traders? Connection between Green Sea economy and desert/points south?
    


## Eastern Green Sea

The parts of the Green Sea further east than the eastern edge of Cymea are a 1000 miles from Embry, and known only as rumors in the west.

  

Population centers in the Eastern Gree Sea include: ~ColdClosedCities~, ~Big Island~, ~EasternDunmari~, ~FarNorthPeninsula~, ~EntranceIslands~, ~DesertTraders~, and ~EastCoast~.

### Ursk

- East of Skaegenland
    
- Land of long, hard winters, short summers, Russian in climate, but slightly modulated by Green Sea
    
- Possible mageocracy with ancient roots, maybe associated with dragons or giants
    
- Possible closed cities - trade missions outside, no outsiders in, but also considering same for western islands west of Chardon
    
- Remnants of old ‘east northlander’ people, relatively uninfluenced by Drankor
    
- Different language, religion? (or maybe Eight Divines still?) If different religion, use the “old gods” of highlands? 
    

### ~BigIsland~

- Random ideas: pirates, pull something from Earthsea, halfling nation, other non-humans, “Athenian democracy”, something else
    
- Eastern end of the island is occupied by hobgoblin pirates, including the Skullcleaver tribe
    

###  ~FarNorthPeninsula~

- Very far north, but coastal so probably not horrible climate?
    
- Includes for now whatever, is east of ~ColdMagocracy~, so basically the whole coastline after it turns northeast just north of big island.
    

### ~EntranceIslands~

- Weird magic, obviously
    

### ~EastCoast~

- Small sheltered area to the south, on the coast, blocked from desert by mountains, so probably like the non-desert parts of North Africa
    
- Maybe small, super isolated region that has been doing its own thing for thousands of years
    
- Place for rumors of strange things aka Mayan/Incan/non-human stuff (jungle lizardfolk nation?)
