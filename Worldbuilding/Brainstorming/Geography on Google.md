# The West Coast

Major features include a major river, large forests to the east against the ~CentralMountains~, a large lake on the main river north of Chardon, a significant peninsula extending into the Endless Ocean south of Chardon, and several island systems and a large bay in the north. In the far north, a chain of volcanoes extends from the central mountains, and the land becomes mountainous and covered in glaciers approaching and beyond the arctic circle. The climate is mild, with wet winters and dry summers; pleasant year round temperatures to the south; cold, snowy winters to the north; and significant coastal moderation on the many islands and peninsulas of this region.
 

### Chardonian Empire

#### Chardon

- Huge city, with significant hinterlands near the mouth of ~MainWestRiver~
    
- Mostly on south bank; north bank poorer, chalyte refineries on north bank, power magic item industry in Chardon
    
- Large, anomalous extinct volcano on north bank
    
- Heir to imperial Drankor, now capitol of a growing Empire stretching north and south
    
- Great Library major center of learning and magic in Taelgar
    
- Hinterlands small farms in river valley and south to forest edge and the hills around small river
    

#### North Chardon Coast

- Needs a name - long stretch of smooth sandy beaches running 800 miles north of Chardon
    
- Sandy beaches, leading to land of rivers and farms and pastures, breadbasket of Chardon
    
- Small stands of ancestral forests but mostly land with a long history of agriculture
    
- Land slopes up to low hills maybe 150-200 miles inland
    
- Relatively few big cities; perhaps one or two in the north? Not sure yet about urbanization in this area.
    
- Parts of this were once prosperous Northlander/Drankorian kingdoms, wiped out in Great War and/or quickly conquered by Chardon
    
    

#### Northern Frontier

- North of the ~GreatChardonLake~, settlement density drops considerably, and area has a more ‘frontier’ feel
    
- Around Voltara -- northernmost big city in the Empire -- is a notable settlement, with an economy powered by chalyte mines in the northern mountains, which provides incredible value and wealth when sold south
    
- Endless Ocean coast west of Voltara some settlement. 
    
- Most trade either goes south along river (not consistently navigable above the lake, though), or west to coast/overland to north of ~NorthChardonCoast~, then south by ship.
    
- All of this area was once small kingdoms, often mix of Drankor/Northlander heritage, that were essentially completely wiped out by Pandor/hobgoblins/Cha’mutte in the post-Great-War period
    
- Beyond here, land of orcs and hobgoblins; this area was generally reclaimed in the past 100-150 years, after Blood Years, so Chardon was pushed back, and then pushed forward
