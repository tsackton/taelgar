# The World of Taelgar

  

The world of Taelgar is a globe, slightly bigger than Earth, with Earth-like seasons and climate. Two major continents, and other possible minor or unknown continents, make up the world, with the northern continent, which stretches from just south of the equator to the arctic circle, the larger and more settled, and the center of all campaigns set in Taelgar to date.

  

The northern continent is surrounded by four major bodies of water. To the west, the Endless Ocean stretches for thousands of miles of trackless oceans into the west. To the south, along the south coast of Dunmar, the Sea of Storms stretches south and west, to the shattered shores of the ancient, now sunken, continent of Hkar. Further south, the ~Southern Ocean~ forms a narrow channel full of islands, and several large bays, between the northern and southern continents. To the north, the ~ArcticOcean~ is an icy, cold place where few travel.

  

The northern continent is marked by three major, continent scale features. In the east, the Green Sea extends from the eastern edge of the continent to nearly the middle, forming a great sea stretching 3000 miles from end to end. South of the Green Sea, a vast desert forms a band across the southern part of the continent, stretching nearly from the Sea of Storms to the Eastern Ocean. West of the Green Sea, the high peaks of the ~CentralMountains~ run nearly the entire length of the continent from north to south. These barriers divide the continent into a handful large-scale geographic regions.

  

- The West Coast, stretching from the the Endless Sea to the ~CentralMountains~ and including the coastal islands in the Endless Sea and as far north as the icy cold of the ~ArcticOcean~.
    
- The Green Sea, divided into the Western and Eastern parts, including the entire area around the Green Sea, as well as the ~CentralMountains~. The Western Green Sea includes all the land between the ~CentralMountains~ and the Green Sea, as far east as Cymea and Skaegenland. The Eastern Green Sea includes everything east of here.
    
- The Far North, stretching from beyond the cold plains of the ~KenkuHomeland~ across the vast northern forests to the eastern coasts.
    
- The Central Coast, the area south of the ~CentralMountains~ stretching to the Sea of Storms, and as far east as the edge of the great desert.
    
- The South, the area including the great desert, and all the lands south of the great desert, including the islands in the ~Southern Ocean~
    

  

Beyond the ~Southern Ocean~ is the mysterious ~Southern Continent~ of which little is known. 

  
  

# The West Coast

Major features include a major river, large forests to the east against the ~CentralMountains~, a large lake on the main river north of Chardon, a significant peninsula extending into the Endless Ocean south of Chardon, and several island systems and a large bay in the north. In the far north, a chain of volcanoes extends from the central mountains, and the land becomes mountainous and covered in glaciers approaching and beyond the arctic circle. The climate is mild, with wet winters and dry summers; pleasant year round temperatures to the south; cold, snowy winters to the north; and significant coastal moderation on the many islands and peninsulas of this region.

  

Population centers in this region include the Chardonian Empire, where the great bulk of the humans live; Illoria, a land of refugees and pirates on the islands in Nevos Bay, south of Chardon; ~Peninsula~, a ~???~; ~WesternIslands~, a ~????~; ~NorthernBay~, where the largest concentration of the original “west northlanders” who still live on the mainland live; ~FormerlyPandarRegion~, a now-ruined but once dominant empire around and north of the volcanic mountains in the far north, including a few smaller polities like Volkrad that were allied against Pandar; ~ArcticTribes~, ~???~; and possibly other places. 

### Chardonian Empire

#### Chardon

- Huge city, with significant hinterlands near the mouth of ~MainWestRiver~
    
- Mostly on south bank; north bank poorer, chalyte refineries on north bank, power magic item industry in Chardon
    
- Large, anomalous extinct volcano on north bank
    
- Heir to imperial Drankor, now capitol of a growing Empire stretching north and south
    
- Great Library major center of learning and magic in Taelgar
    
- Hinterlands small farms in river valley and south to forest edge and the hills around small river
    

#### North Chardon Coast

- Needs a name - long stretch of smooth sandy beaches running 800 miles north of Chardon
    
- Sandy beaches, leading to land of rivers and farms and pastures, breadbasket of Chardon
    
- Small stands of ancestral forests but mostly land with a long history of agriculture
    
- Land slopes up to low hills maybe 150-200 miles inland
    
- Relatively few big cities; perhaps one or two in the north? Not sure yet about urbanization in this area.
    
- Parts of this were once prosperous Northlander/Drankorian kingdoms, wiped out in Great War and/or quickly conquered by Chardon
    

#### Lake Valandros

- Big lake on north branch of ~MainRiver~
    
- Low rolling hills on the west, forests on the east
    
- Western hills settled, productive iron and silver mines
    
- Eastern shore less dense, scattered forest
    
- Several medium/large cities, center of much metalworking in empire
    
- Port on north of lake major trade stopover for goods coming from north, most especially the incredibly valuable chalyte from Voltara
    

#### Great Chardon Forest

- Needs a name - very large forest between the ~MainRiver~ and the ~CentralMountains~
    
- Only western edge really settled, and the area between the two forks of ~MainRiver~, which is really part of the Chardonian hinterlands
    
- Interior of forest (along south fork of ~MainRiver~) weird and magical, not settled by humans, at least not Chardonians
    

#### Emerald Coast

- Needs a name, maybe. Coast of the Emerald bay, southwest of Chardon. 
    
- Ancient, magical canal cuts through narrow part of the isthmus, allowing seagoing travel, but expensive to navigate for ~to be determined reasons~
    
- Large southern port/trading city, one of the 2-3 largest in Chardon Empire outside Chardon
    
- The northern slopes of the ~CoastalMountains~ are another significant mining area.
    

#### Lizardfolk River Basin

- Southern river has several large lizardfolk communities that operate somewhat outside the strictures of the Empire
    
- Border area between Chardon and Dunmar on road to Songara is pretty wild; known as the Myraeni Gap, it is rough, hilly land that has traditionally been under the control of the Myraenians, a mysterious and closed society; in the modern era, they have retreated a bit and kobolds are a serious nuisance here
    
- Marshy lowlands along ~LizardFolk River~ is in many ways the effective southwestern border of the Empire, as much of this terrain is a mire of swamps, lizardfolk settlements, and confusing waterways that are hard to cross and navigate. Trade routes tend to run along eaves of the forest, and the old Drankorian bridges no longer span the river.
    

#### Northern Frontier

- North of the ~GreatChardonLake~, settlement density drops considerably, and area has a more ‘frontier’ feel
    
- Around Voltara -- northernmost big city in the Empire -- is a notable settlement, with an economy powered by chalyte mines in the northern mountains, which provides incredible value and wealth when sold south
    
- Endless Ocean coast west of Voltara some settlement. 
    
- Most trade either goes south along river (not consistently navigable above the lake, though), or west to coast/overland to north of ~NorthChardonCoast~, then south by ship.
    
- All of this area was once small kingdoms, often mix of Drankor/Northlander heritage, that were essentially completely wiped out by Pandor/hobgoblins/Cha’mutte in the post-Great-War period
    
- Beyond here, land of orcs and hobgoblins; this area was generally reclaimed in the past 100-150 years, after Blood Years, so Chardon was pushed back, and then pushed forward
    

### Illoria

#### Burganos and Silanus

- Rocky, warm subtropical islands, kind of Caribbean vibe
    
- Main islands and by far the biggest population centers of Illoria
    
- Highly seafaring people; largely a motley group of refugees, outcasts, and pirates
    
- Recently conquered by Chardon, and now a Protectorate of the Empire, with a Chardonian governor installed
    
- Aiming for a kind of freewheeling attitude of the people, some piracy but generally kind of outlaws + outcasts vibe; mostly small cities and seacoast towns, economy deeply tied to ocean
    

#### Small Southern Islands

- Historically not really populated, but now home of whatever Illorians fled Chardonian rule
    
- NOT currently ruled by Chardon
    
- Even stronger Caribbean vibe (geographically)
    

### Mawakel Peninsula

- Home to the Mawar people and the Mawar Confederacy
    

### ~WesternIslands~

- Thinking this is a isolated society, not necessarily with a strong navy, fairly urbanized with dense agriculture and fishing; maybe use some aspects of historical Japan as a model
    
- Trade with Chardon, but possibly one island is the only one that foreigners are allowed on?
    
- Almost pure “West Northlander” with no imperial influences; very distinct culturally, religiously, and linguistically from rest of world in many ways. Many people don’t speak common, for example.
    

### ~Peninsula~

- Possible location for half-elfs (peronar)
    

### ~NorthBay~

### ~FormerlyPandarRegion~

### ~ArcticTribes~

# The Central Coast

  

Dunmar, Yuvanti mountains, Myraeni gap, whatever is/was east of Dunmar, Drankor, Desolation of Cha’mutte, etc.

  

# The Green Sea

The Green Sea stretches from the far east to the middle of the continent. To the west, major features are the Cymean peninsula and the islands north and south, including Skaegenland, as well as the Mostreve hills in southern Sembara, and the ~VostokMountains~. In the center and east, major features include a large island centrally located in the middle of the Green Sea, and a large, dense archipelago blocking the mouth of the Green Sea from the Endless Ocean. While the west is densely settled, in the east, along both coasts, most people live close to the ocean: in the north, due to the increasing cold and snow; in the south, the encroaching desert.

  

Population centers in the Western Green Sea include: Greater Sembara, the Cymean peninsula, Greater Vostok (including the Skaer islands), and the center river valley, including ~Irebor~ and ~SouthCymea~.

  

Population centers in the Eastern Gree Sea include: ~NorthCoast~, ~Big Island~, ~EasternDunmari~, ~FarNorthPeninsula~, ~EntranceIslands~, and ~EastCoast~.

  

## Climatology Overview

The Green Sea forms a rough triangle, with the western point at about 40 degrees North, and the eastern edges stretching from roughly 60 degrees North to roughly 30 degrees North. The Green Sea is split into eastern and western halves, divided by ~BigIsland~.

  

In the winter, a zone of high pressure tends to sit over the southernmost parts of the Green Sea (from about 30 N - 35 N), causing light and variable trade winds south of the ~BigIsland~, and a dry climate with little precipitation, while strong westerlies blow north of about 35 N. 

  

In the summer, the land to the west heats up and the zone of high pressure shifts polarward. In the western Green Sea, a monsoon wind blows from the east, bringing summer rains to Sembara and Vostok, while in the east, light and variable winds shift northward. In the south, the powerful trade winds blow from the open ocean to the east. 

  

Consequences for trade: sailing east in the northern section of the Green Sea is easy in winter, while sailing west in the southern and western parts are easy in summer. Historically/real world, the distances are kind of on par with the Indian Ocean trade. 

  

In the west, the climate is dominated by the summer monsoons, which brings moisture-laden air and spring/summer rains, getting increasing dry moving south from the Cymean peninsula. 

  

The ~BigIsland~ has a climate not dissimilar to Japan, with the summer monsoon bringing rain to the southeastern side of the island and the winter westerlies bringing snow to the northwestern side of the island. 

  

The South Coast, from ~SouthCymea~ all the way east, tends to be dry, with a climate reminiscent of North Africa “between the mountains,” with almost no rain; only ~SouthCymea~ itself trends towards a humid subtropical climate (perhaps Pampas-like). The exception is the far east, east of the mountains, which is much more influenced by the Endless Ocean than the Green Sea, and has a much wetter and warmer climate influenced by the warm currents and prevailing trade wind of the Endless Ocean. 

  

The climate of the western islands is highly varied, being strongly oceanic and influenced by the Green Sea, the Endless Ocean, and magic. 

  

The North Coast around Skaegenland is heavily maritime, reminiscent of Nova Scotia/Scandinavia, which continues east to the southernmost extend of the North Coast. The northeastern coast, however, is much colder, more reminiscent of eastern Siberia, with long winters and short summers, although the maritime influence moderates the seasonality. 

## The Western Green Sea

### Greater Sembara

#### Sembara

- Inward agricultural focus. Sphere of influence pushing more west and interior than into the Western Gulf - limited or no real navy, small scale fishing but not a major part of the culture or economy (think China)
    
- Trade devalued -- historical analog: ancient Rome, where wealth from land was much more significant than wealth from trade
    
- Very fertile soil and rich agricultural harvests in the heart of Sembara drive the economy. Major exporter of foodstuffs and raw materials. Also higher population density than anywhere else between the good soil and the miracle that the heartland of Sembara has never been overrun by anything too bad since even before the Drankorians relatively gently took over
    
- Landed barons and dukes dominate local politics
    
- Very good relationship with halflings, who are the favored traders, and have formal rights of free passage and access to markets across Sembara.
    
- Cooler relationship with dwarves -- not at all hostile, but dwarves are more aligned with the highland kingdoms, esp Ardlas and Lavnoch
    
- Close relationship with lizardfolk, who have played an outsized role in Sembara’s history and establishment of House of Sewick.
    
- Elves very rare in Sembara, with little direct political contacts; largest Elven settlement nearby is the semi-mythical kingdom of Orenlas in the forests surrounding a supposedly enchanted lake south/southeast of Tyrwingha in the Cymea foothills.
    
- Stoneborn are also very rare in Sembara; mostly in the high peaks north of Ulrich devastation; more common in Northlands than elsewhere, coming from the Vostok highlands
    

#### Tollen

- Masters of the Western Gulf. Significant fishing and merchant fleet. Strongest navy in the Western Gulf and major fishing industry (whales? Cod? Not sure what the key fish would be. Also no lenten red meat rules to drive a cash crop fish industry, so maybe not quite as developed as say the Basque medieval fisherman who got rich on cod)
    
- Controls a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the Volta as well as the Tollen city proper, and the coastal islands in the greater Tollen harbor.
    
- Controls the Straits of Cymea, main seafarers in the Western Gulf
    
- Manufacturing esp of clothes key. Silk (or cotton or a made up fiber) from Tyrwingha and wool from Sembara comes to the Tollen + northlands region to turn into fine clothes
    
- Big dye industry in the hinterlands
    
- Influential in the northlands more than anywhere else and somewhat culturally connected to that region (although with a clear, distinct identity)
    
- Some significant far eastern trade, although that in general is probably more halfling/Cymean; Tollen is however a major market for Cymea traders, who exchange goods from around the Green Sea for Sembaran/Tollen cloth/silk/clothes.
    
- University in Tollen is major center of magical learning in the Sembara/Vostok region, only some parts of Cymea could compete in western Green Sea area. Dye industry + magic makes Tollen a center of development of magical tattoos.
    
- In many ways more cosmopolitan than Sembara; significant local halfling and dwarven communities, and stoneborn are not unheard of. Elves still super-rare, and lizardfolk if anything less common than in Sembara.
    

#### Ardlas and Lavnoch

- Basic political organization is the village, with a Speaker
    
- Most developed as political units of the highland kingdoms with strong kings and organized central government
    
- Strong alliance with dwarves over the last 50-100 years and many dwarves might live in some of the mountain towns. Some highlanders also live in dwarven towns in this area.
    
- The two kingdoms are sometimes rivals, sometimes allies, but have a clear sense of shared culture. 
    
- Trade in raw materials important, as is small scale farming and especially sheep/goats
    
- Growing less ‘Sembaran’ esp with the dwarven influence
    

#### Zovcka

- Isolationist and wants to be left alone
    
- In some of the higher steppes, still speak the old east northlander and a major reserve of worshippers of the old gods
    
- A strong cultural tradition of staying out of larger politics and wanting to be left alone. * 
    
- Low population density
    
- Hunting still important in some regions, although hardy grains (i.e. barley or an analog) and wooly mountain goats/sheep are the main food source.
    
- Perhaps a strong druidic/fey connection; maybe also stoneborn connection
    

#### Breva

-  A small kingdom, and in some ways riven by the most internal tensions. 
    
- On the borders of the northern highlands (Zovcka), the western highlands (Lavnoch), and the northlands of Sembara.
    
- Probably has the least cohesion of any of the highland kingdoms, and a weak king -- perhaps mostly a figurehead. Some of the nobles might be more aligned with the north, or the west, or the east and this could be a good place for political intrigue and so on.
    
- Perhaps little true cultural cohesion and a lot of challenges being organized. The northern landowners who live in the rising slopes of the north plateau are really more aligned with Zovcka; the ones in the west with Lavnoch, and the southern parts with the northlands
    
- Might work to have it a little bit smaller than it is on the map, moving up the northlands 
    

#### Addermarch

- The most ‘Sembaran’ of the southern marches. People mostly Sembaran or mixed Tyrwinghan/Sembaran and culturally firmly in the Sembaran sphere
    
- Independent largely due to historical circumstances
    

#### Maseau

- Largely depopulated during the Great War and mostly a result of recent resettlement as well as refugees who fled north from the ~Irebor Alliance~
    
- Originally the Sembaran Duchy of Maseau, but it was largely abandoned during the plague years by the sembaran crown. But the duke and their family ended up kinda forming a refugee welcoming committee and it became known as a place for the homeless and the lost folks of the Great War. Perhaps a key place for the rangers now who have some of that vibe. However, the hobgoblin conquests in the 1580s could have impacted to make this place much more militant. Maybe now it is a bit like Israel -- highly militarized with a chip on their shoulder about past suffering and how this can’t ever happen to our people again
    

#### The Refounded Alliance of Aurbez

- Founded by two groups -- a core of refugees from the collapse of Insingue who hid out in the hills during the blood years, and developed a bit of a guerilla culture also supported the rangers a fair bit, second a group of folks who settled in Maseau or even the western marches for a bit, but were attracted by the growing rumors of an Insinguen  culture / group
    
- These people explicitly call back to Insingue as kinda their founding ideal / lost homeland
    
- Welcoming to travelers but very protective of their prerogative to the land, conceptually believe they have a claim to any habitable parts of the plaguelands, fiercely independent
    
- Rebuilding not foreign affairs is real goal, but claims to be the heirs of Insignue and claims sovereignty over all the lands south of Maseau and north of Insingue
    
- Major settlements are along the Aursen, along the Dunmar Road, in the foothills and valleys of the Douren, and in the high elevations from the source of the Aursen to the source of the Mansance
    

#### The March of the Andonne

- The borderlands in 1750, a mostly empty stretch between the Mansance to the west, the Andonne to the south, Maseau to the north, and the forests of Addermarch to the east
    
- A zone of largely independent lords, backed by Sembaran wealth - anyone who can raise some folk and is willing to help staff a castle basically gets a generous stipend and to be a lord
    
- Most castles and towns are in the north, along the Dunmar Road, or along the western stretches of the Andonne
    
- The Andonne as it flows east gets ash-choked and polluted, and by the time it reaches Lake Aeurlian is it gray-brown and inhospitable to life
    

  

### Vostok

#### South Vostok

- The southern part of Vostok, basically the hundred miles closest to the coast as well as a narrow band around the Kem (more eastern river) stretching somewhat north of where the Niva joins it, and also somewhat along the Niva
    
- Key political organization around a set of chieftains of clans who control a central territory and some of the hinterlands - but some areas are overlapped between multiple chieftains and it isn’t a land of clear regional boundaries (inspired by the Mandala political model of south east asia -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala_(political_model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala_(political_model)) ). The idea is not really borders, a set of related clans/tribes/chieftains/kingdoms whatever with overlapping circles of influence
    
- Name: refered to as South Vostok or South Vosland in Sembara
    
- Minimal roads - some rough roads along the coast but communication can be slow except by sea / river. 
    
- Lots of uninhabited land, even within the more organized territories around each of the major tribes/clans/chiefs
    
- I was also looking at the middle African Hausa Kingdoms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_Kingdoms)  for inspiration
    
- Some of the larger tribes might recognize Cymea as a overlord type, but little meaning to that outside of perhaps some annual tribute (sailors for the navy?) and a personal relationship between the chief and the Cymean leader (common pattern in south asia vis-a-vie China) 
    

#### North Vostok

- Very few people
    
- Culturally connected to the Zovcka more than anywhere else, but long sundered, and not a lot of people go back and forth through the lakes region
    
- Lakes region probably mostly uninhabited or entirely uninhabited -- the people of North Vostok are mostly clustered around the big lake in the center of Vostok and the eastern slopes of the central volcanic mountains
    
- Some ancient connection to the folks who built the big wall in the north
    

#### Skaegenland

- Ancient sea-faring people, culturally and linguistically distinct, although related to ancient inhabitants of Tyrwingha and Sembara before Drankor
    
- Distinct religion derived from original Hkaran mariner pantheon
    
- Loosely Viking based, but should blend in some other influences to make them more interesting
    
- Politically disorganized, perhaps slightly theocratic or perhaps full fledged theocracy
    

#### ~KenkuHomeland~

- North of the Vostok wall, cold dry steppe
    
- New homeland of Kenku
    

### Cymea

#### Cymea

- A collection of city states, not fully united, but with a dominant one, probably somewhere in the south-east (perhaps near the more southerly river in the main part of the penisula), or perhaps even on the big island
    
- Inspired by Drankor -- would it make sense to have a leader styling themselves the Emperor of Cymea, in the same vein that a lot of historical figures styled themselves Roman Emperors long after Rome was gone (Byzantium parallel somewhere maybe?)
    
- Clear division between Western Cymea (see below) and the main eastern and southern lands
    
- Some significant influence towards Vostok and a major player on the wider Green Sea
    
- Maybe sees themselves as a bit ‘above’ the Western Gulf and Sembara and trades with them, but sees Sembara as an upstart (whereas Sembara probably sees Cymeans as fooling themselves and pretending to grandier they don’t have, but also, Sembara is more inward focused and is happy enough as long as folks buy their wheat -- the passion would be more to the west and south)
    

#### Western Cymea

- Scattered small fishing villages and isolated farmsteads in the hills -- limited political organization
    
- Haven for pirates during the Blood Years, cleaned up by Tollen during Cece’s reign (perhaps with overt or implicit support of Sembara)
    
- Perhaps now there is a Tollen military governor of some kind? Or Tollen is encouraging settlement there?
    
- Could have a heavy Tollen naval presence 
    

  

### ~River Valley~

#### ~SouthCymea~

- ??? Need to decide what this is
    

  

### ~EasternDunmari~

- Southeast of Cymea north of southern mountains inland of 
    
- Other branch of Dunmari migration, but only distant cultural ties, linked primarily by religion and language
    
- Now sedentary
    
- Traders? Connection between Green Sea economy and desert/points south?
    

#### ~Irebor~

- Largely destroyed during Blood Years, now ashy, dry Plaguelands, although some parts of southern Greater Sembara trying to reclaim the very western edge of ~Irebor~
    

## Eastern Green Sea

The parts of the Green Sea further east than the eastern edge of Cymea are a 1000 miles from Embry, and known only as rumors in the west.

  

Population centers in the Eastern Gree Sea include: ~ColdClosedCities~, ~Big Island~, ~EasternDunmari~, ~FarNorthPeninsula~, ~EntranceIslands~, ~DesertTraders~, and ~EastCoast~.

### Ursk

- East of Skaegenland
    
- Land of long, hard winters, short summers, Russian in climate, but slightly modulated by Green Sea
    
- Possible mageocracy with ancient roots, maybe associated with dragons or giants
    
- Possible closed cities - trade missions outside, no outsiders in, but also considering same for western islands west of Chardon
    
- Remnants of old ‘east northlander’ people, relatively uninfluenced by Drankor
    
- Different language, religion? (or maybe Eight Divines still?) If different religion, use the “old gods” of highlands? 
    

### ~BigIsland~

- Random ideas: pirates, pull something from Earthsea, halfling nation, other non-humans, “Athenian democracy”, something else
    
- Eastern end of the island is occupied by hobgoblin pirates, including the Skullcleaver tribe
    

###  ~FarNorthPeninsula~

- Very far north, but coastal so probably not horrible climate?
    
- Includes for now whatever, is east of ~ColdMagocracy~, so basically the whole coastline after it turns northeast just north of big island.
    

### ~EntranceIslands~

- Weird magic, obviously
    

### ~EastCoast~

- Small sheltered area to the south, on the coast, blocked from desert by mountains, so probably like the non-desert parts of North Africa
    
- Maybe small, super isolated region that has been doing its own thing for thousands of years
    
- Place for rumors of strange things aka Mayan/Incan/non-human stuff (jungle lizardfolk nation?)
    

# Far North

North of the Green Sea, on the eastern side of the ~CentralMountains~, great taiga forests stretch for thousands of miles (maybe?), among which some civilizations, human and non-human alike, make a living. This is also quite distant and “far away” from the “western” world, and would include everything north of ~KenkuHomeland~, ~Skaegenland~, ~ClosedCities~, ~EastOfClosedCities~, ~FarNorthPeninsula~.

  

No idea what, if any, population centers are here. Could be wilderness, could be frost giants and white dragons, could be something weirder, but definitely not densely populated by humans. Huge isolated stoneborn empires?

# The South

Land of mystery to people in the northwest; includes desert people, as well as island people in archipelago, and whatever is on the mainland. Eventually could include southern continent when/if need it.
