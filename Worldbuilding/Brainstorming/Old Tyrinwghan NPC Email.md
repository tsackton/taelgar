Caerwyn of Abenfyrd was born the fourth and youngest child of the castellan of the small town of Abenfyrd, in the northern edge of the Mostreve Hills in Tyrwingha. At the head of navigation of the Aben River, Abenfyrd was a quiet place to grow up, prosperous enough from the timber trade going south to the capitol and beyond, but too close to the Plaguelands to attract much settlement or growth. 

  

Caerwyn's eldest sister, Lona, was always destined to take over as castellan for their father, and Caerwyn was expected to follow his two older brothers as officers in the Tyrwinghan army. However, as a child he showed no aptitude for war, preferring to lose himself in the stories of giants and magic and the archfey.  As a young man, he rejected the army and instead headed downriver to Tafolwern, the capitol of Tyrwingha, where he became a lay servant of the temple administrator of the Temple of the Sibyl. 

  

This suited him for many years, as it gave him an opportunity to read in the library and explore the city of Tafolwern, where he began to learn more of the fey heritage of Tyrwingha. During this time, he found he was rarely inspired by the divine and found the temple routines a chore instead of a joy. Several years after arriving in Tafolwern, he found himself adrift and not sure of his place in the world, until he encountered Breca, a reclusive wizard devoted to uncovering the mysteries of the fey, during his investigations into the fey mysterious at the heart of Tyrwingha's history. 

  

Leaving the temple, he became Breca's apprentice for three years. Although they rarely spoke and were never close, she still guided his studies and helped him shape his mind to control arcane magic. Restless in one place, once Caerwyn learned enough that he felt he could venture forth on his own, he left Breca's service and Tafolwern, turning west to slowly make his way towards the mountains and perhaps even as far as the long journey to Chardon. A few months into his journey, while spending some time in Fellburn on the river Enst, he learned of rumors of a bridge in the small town of Cleanseau, just beyond the head of navigation on the Enst, that was supposedly the work of giants in a long gone age. His childhood fascination with giants reawakened, he decided to head here to learn what he could.
