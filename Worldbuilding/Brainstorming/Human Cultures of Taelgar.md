Some rough notes trying to synchronize and make canonical some basic rough notes about the various human people of Taelgar. Most of these groups still need names, and there is plenty of room for more subdivisions within most of these.

All humanity was created on Hkar, and lived there for a time. Modern day human cultures are the product of a variety of different migrations from Hkar, combined with mixing and diversification on the mainland. 

This document is first organized by outlining the major migrations from Hkar, and then documenting history on the mainland, so things jump back and forth a bit. 

## Cultures on Hkar

Hkar is not well developed, but there are at least two distinct cultural trends that are important. 

### Hkaran Religious Traditions

The first major cultural trend is the slow transition from Intercessory religions to pantheonic religions during the history of humanity on Hkar. 

The first humans prayed to their creators, but the High Gods did not answer prayers, and so very quickly a kind of proto-religion developed based around praying to Intercessory spirits - whether ancestors, or spirits of the land, or anything else. This continued for a while. 

However, over time, some of the intercessory spirits grew powerful, strong enough to grant miracles in their own right. Powerful deities attracted more prayer and worship, making them more powerful, and able to grant stronger miracles. Over time, this lead to the development of pantheonic religions, where prayers were directed specifically to deities with the power to grant miracles on their own, instead of to spirits who would intercede with Arha/Malik on behalf of the person praying.

The first migrants from Hkar are pure intercessory; the last people to leave (refugees fleeing the fall of Hkar) are pure pantheonic, but some people in the middle may have kind of strangely mixed religions. 

### Urban Magical Culture

The second major cultural trend is the transition from a relatively rural culture of small villages and more primal/divine magic to a strongly urban culture with a heavy influence on shaping the world through arcane magic. 

The first humans lived in a scattering of villages and towns. Hkar in the early days was incredibly productive, and little work was required to acquire sufficient food. Probably there were towns and groups of people who lived together, but I think this was probably not a massively urban culture to start. I would guess that divine and primal magic were quite common, but arcane magic was rare. Possibly early on in the days of humanity arcane magic was perceived as a bit dubious, even. Dangerous and unreliable. 

Over time, you get an increasing centralization that co-occurs with the development of arcane magic. This, in particular, happens in the east coast of Hkar, and it is on the east coast that you get huge urban cities that trade with the Elder Folk on the mainland and develop strong pantheonic religions, and then become the founders of Drankor. 

Of course, there is variability within Hkar, but a general gradient from rural/divine -> urban/arcane that runs both west -> east and early -> late. 

## Migrations

The Hkaran cultural developments primarily influence modern day culture through the timing of human migrations from Hkar. 

There are three major migrations from Hkar, as well as some additional minor migrations. 

### Early Explorers (Minor)

The first migrants from Hkar are relatively disorganized group practicing an intercessory religion who largely settle on the west coast of the mainland, in the shadow of Alcarinque, and slowly spread along the western side of the sentinels. These people and their descendants are referred to as the **Northerners** (better name needed?), and largely do not retain contact with Hkar after departing. Their reasons for departing are left unclear.

### Pre-Urban Exodus (Major)

As the east begins to urbanize and explore, there is an early wave of migration that settles primarily in the central and southern regions of the mainland. These people and their descendants leave Hkar during the early growth of pantheonic religions, and their religion is left undetermined. They are referred to as the **Southerners** (better name needed?). They largely do maintain contact and trade relationships with the Hkaran homeland, and are probably best thought of as the first Hkaran colonies on the mainland, perhaps with a vibe initially similar to early Greek and Phoenician Mediterranean colonies. They grow rich on trade with Elder Folk and probably develop into powerful civilizations, left undeveloped for now. 

### Mariner Migration (Major)

The western culture of Hkar develops as a major seafaring culture, and they eventually discover the eastern edge of the Green Sea (whether by sailing west, or by sailing south, is left undetermined). But -- potentially as part of the expansion of the urban arcane cultures -- the mariner culture largely leaves Hkar and establishes themselves in the Green Sea area. These are the **mariner** culture, and they bring a pantheonic religion, a seafaring culture, and their own unique magical traditions to the mainland. 

### Slow Emigration (Minor)

After the mariner exodus, potentially as the urban culture spreads across Hkar, various other minor groups leave for new lands. This happens at a variable pace during the years between the mariner exodus and the Downfall wars, in kind of undetermined ways, and is a good option for novel modern day cultures with unique pantheonic religions (perhaps the spread of Mos Numena is a driving factor in the exodus).

One major example of these people are the **Dunmari** (or proto-Dunmari as they would have been at the time of their emigration).

### Downfall Refugees (Major)

The Downfall Wars involve a major war in Hkar that (somehow) leads to the destruction of the entire continent and the reshaping of the world. The highly magical urban culture, with a strong pantheon, at this point dominates much of Hkar, and it is this culture that is the predominate culture of the refugees who found Drankor. This is the **Drankorian** culture. 

There of course may be other refugees that fled at the same time, and founded other cultures as yet determined, with different characteristics. 

### Summary

So, the basic pattern is you have early migrations of **Northerners** who bring intercessory religion and settle in the shadow of the Elder Folk, followed by the establishment of Hkaran colonies by the **Southerners** with unclear religion (some of whom, anyway, maintain contact with Hkar). There is space for as-yet-undeveloped intercessory migrations along with Northerners, but don't need to have existed. 

Then the urban arcane culture grows, and eventually leads to the **mariner** exodus, followed (and/or preceded) by a slow trickle of minor emigrations of predominantly non-arcane pantheonic peoples. 

Then you have the Downfall and the flight of refugees, who at this point are largely urban arcane pantheonic people. **Drankorian** culture is the major offshoot in the northwest of the mainland, but there can be others

## Mainland Cultures in the Modern Age

Skipping over tracing the entire history of everyone to elaborate on people that exist now; but, hopefully, trying to keep histories consistent. 

### Northerners

These are the people who predominate cultural heritage is the earliest migrations from Hkar. 

Generally speaking, "pure" northerner cultures in the modern day consist of the descendants of people who fled Drankorian conquest (the Deno'qai, who fled inland; the Mawar and related, who fled seaward), and the descendants of people never strongly influenced by Drankor (not yet created Island and Far North cultures).
#### Deno'qai

Descendants of people who fled north and east from the Drankorian Western Wars. These are people who retain much of the original Northerner traditions, and were never strongly influenced by the Drankorian Empire (retained the original Northerner language and a derivative religion, the tanshi folk tradition). In the current day, live mostly on the western slopes of the Sentinels. 
#### Mawar

Also descendants of people who fled Drankorian expansion, seaward. While never formally conquered, these people were much more significantly influenced by Drankor, and adopted Mos Numena albeit with some quirks, retaining a bit of their intercessory heritage with the prevalence of "saints and heroes" as a focal point of prayer among the Mawar. Although politically diverged, this is presumably also related to the culture of the whole "Mawar Bay / Great Bay" area, including the coast west of Voltara and the island off Mawar. Potentially some religious diversity, with northern folk religions also playing a role in some parts of the Mawaran cultural spread (perhaps on the big island or the northern stretches of the Great Bay there is a more pure ancestor worship variant of the tanshi tradition with old roots).

#### Island Culture (Not Canon Yet)

Theoretically, the culture of the mysterious islands off the western coast of the mainland are relatively pure Northerner, never conquered by Drankor. Potentially these people retained connections to Drankor in a way that other Northerner cultures didn't, but this is left undeveloped for now.

#### North Coast Culture / Arctic Culture (Not Canon Yet)

Theoretically, the culture of the far northern coast, beyond the influence of Drankor. Undeveloped. Might be one or two or more distinct groups.

### Northerner/Drankorian

These are the people who have a Northerner heritage, but were strongly influenced and intermixed with the Drankorian cultures. 

####  Northern Realms Cultures

The people who are the descendants of Northerners who were either conquered by Drankor, or ended up strongly influenced by Drankor and intermixing. Generally speaking, this is the broad swath of people who were subjects of the Drankorian Empire and lived north of Chardon. These people were the backbone of the diverse set of small kingdoms and realms that existed in the north pre-Great-War. Their culture was largely Drankorian, with the opportunity for some quirks/oddities/etc as desired. Tend to think of these cultures as kind of broadly Germanic, but also probably a lot of diversity, with some groups tending more towards Mawaran and others more Drankorian, in a broadly north/south gradient. These people suffered greatly in the Great War, as pretty much all the densest population areas of this culture were either destroyed by dragons or conquered and ruled by hobgoblins. In the current day, the more "Drankorian" flavor of this population is the heartland of the Chardonian Empire living on the agricultural coast, and the more "Mawaran" tends to the interior around Lake Valandros and north. These people are generally Mos Numena worshippers. 

#### Ilorian

The islands of the Nevos Sea were conquered by Drankor and converted to Mos Numena, but never fully integrated into the empire. Illoria has always been a melting pot, and the people of the islands were historically a mix of Northerners and probably some later Hkaran migrants, so even before the downfall this was a blended place. In current day also includes people with Dunmari ancestry, some "northern realms culture" refugees, Drankorian refugees, some of everybody. Probably one of the most religiously diverse places on the mainland. 

#### Peninsula Culture (Not Canon Yet)

Don't yet know exactly what is here, but (a) it is very likely a strange and magical place that is weird and unique in a lot of ways, and (b) whatever people live here have strands of northerner and Drankorian influence. 

### Drankorian

People with a predominantly Drankorian heritage. This is largely the area that was controlled by the Drankorian Empire. While there are four subcultures listed here, these are all largely gradations of a predominant Drankorian culture, with various degrees of intergradations with local cultures. 
#### Chardonian

The culture of the Chardonians; kind of blends into "Northern Realms Culture" and "Illorian Culture" in some ways. Basically, you have the western side of the Drankorian Empire, which largely escapes the first plague. Probably largely the people of the Chasa and Yeraad watersheds. But Chardon itself is a bit of melting pot too. 

#### Cymean

Cymean peninsula, not super developed. 

#### Isinguer

Largely destroyed in the Great War. Not super developed. 

#### Sembaran

The Drankorian-influenced culture of the Sembaran lowlands. 

### Mariner
