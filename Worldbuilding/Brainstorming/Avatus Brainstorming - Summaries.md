## Avatus Brainstorming (AI Summary)

Codex summary of all notes that mention Avatus. 

### Overview

 **Avatus** is described as an emperor who ruled an autocratic dominion on the southern edge of [[Sembara]] in the early 1400s DR, commonly called the **Dominion of Avatus** or **Domain of Avatus**.  
 His power base lay in and around the [[Mostreve Hills]], exerting overlordship over scattered baronies and small lordships, growing strong by taxing trade and recruiting large numbers of [[Hobgoblins]] as mercenaries and enforcers.  
 In Sembaran memory, he is the last major pre‑Derik I threat from the south: a conquering autocrat whose defeat by [[Derik I]] becomes the founding moment of “modern Sembara”.  
 He commissioned at least one major legendary artifact—the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]—via a powerful hobgoblin court wizard, tying his rule to planar and necromantic magic.  
 Later notes and chats sometimes spell his name **[[Avatus]]**; context makes clear this is the same figure as Avatus, though some of that material is explicitly tagged as older or non‑canonical.

### Geography & Extent of the Dominion

 **Core region.**  
   Canonical timeline describes the **Dominion of Avatus** as exerting overlordship over scattered baronies and small lordships in the **[[Mostreve Hills]]**, strengthening itself by taxing overland trade and hiring hobgoblin mercenaries.  
     Source: [[Timeline of Sembaran History]].  

 **Northern reach: Cleenseau and the Enst.**  
   In the early 1420s, Avatus advances north to the [[Enst]] at [[Cleenseau]]. He captures the old Drankorian fort on the south bank, then uses **permanent dimension door magic** to move troops under the river into an underground staging area, outflanking Sembaran defenses.  
     Sources: [[Cleenseau History Notes]], [[Hobgoblin Camp]].  
   During the war, Cleenseau is captured and used as a **central staging point** in the campaign against Sembara. The population is “largely enslaved” rather than massacred; the **Stonebridge** halflings are allowed to keep running [[The Crossroads Inn]] as a hobgoblin watering hole and secretly aid human escapees through tunnels.  
     Source: [[Cleenseau History Notes]], [[Discord Chat  Avatus and Hobgolbins]].  

 **Southern and eastern borders.**  
   Broader historical notes place the Dominion south of Sembara, alongside the kingdom of [[Tyrwingha]], forming part of a ring of powers hemming in Sembara before Derik I’s rise (alongside [[Cymea]], [[Isingue]], [[Dunmar]], [[Chardon]] and the raiding [[Skaer]]).  
     Sources: [[Avatus]], [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]], “GDrive  Sembara Document”.  
   Chats suggest Avatus’s dominion may have stretched **from the mountains to Tyrwingha**, but its precise extent is deliberately left fuzzy for later refinement.  
     Source: [[Discord Chat  History of Western Green Sea]].  

 **Addermarch’s position.**  
   Later worldbuilding emphasizes [[Addermarch]] as a rough frontier that **resisted conquest**: repeatedly probed by Avatus but never fully subdued, serving as a base for guerrilla resistance and ranger traditions rather than a settled Avatus province.  
     Sources: [[Discord Chat  Addermarch]], [[Discord Chat  History of Western Green Sea]].  
   Earlier notes about “lands formerly controlled by Avatus” being reorganized into new Sembaran border duchies (e.g., [[Duchy of Maseau]]) may implicitly include or border Addermarch, but recent discussions lean toward Addermarch preserving a more independent history.  
     Sources: [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], [[Discord Chat  Upper Istaros Region]].

### Government, Society, and Military

 **Regime type.**  
   Avatus is consistently framed as a **military autocrat**—an emperor or dictator ruling a centralized dominion with a strong personal cult and tightly controlled subjects.  
     Source: [[Avatus]], [[Tyrwingha  Ideas]], “GDrive  Sembara Document”.  
   Hobgoblins form the backbone of his armies and administration, aligning with a broader setting idea of hobgoblins as authoritarian, hierarchical slavers who view humans as naturally subordinate.  
     Sources: [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]], [[Discord Chat  Avatus and Hobgolbins]].  

 **Attitude toward population and slavery.**  
   Cleenseau notes depict Avatus as **seeking conquest and subjects, not revenge**: populations that submit are largely enslaved and heavily taxed, not exterminated, because the regime values labor and agricultural productivity.  
     Source: [[Cleenseau History Notes]].  
   Resistance is met with brutality—enslavement, harsh control, and strategic terror—but the “default” occupation is harsh authoritarian rule rather than indiscriminate slaughter.  

 **Use of hobgoblins and werewolves.**  
   Tyrwingha‑focused lore describes Avatus/[[Avatus]] commanding an army of **hobgoblins and vicious werewolves**, reinforcing his image as a warlord who mixes disciplined hobgoblin forces with supernatural shock troops.  
     Source: [[Tyrwingha  Ideas]].  

 **New Drankorian emperor.**  
   Secret lore for the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] calls Avatus “styling himself the **New Drankorian Emperor**,” explicitly linking his propaganda and legitimacy to the fallen [[Drankorian Empire]], even as Sembara is still absorbing Drankorian legacy.  
     Sources: [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], [[Avatus]].  

### Magical Projects & the Court Wizard

#### Mirror of Soul Trapping

 **Commissioning.**  
   About **150 years before the [[Great War]]** (i.e., roughly late 1300s to very early 1400s DR), Avatus commissions the **[[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]** from his **hobgoblin court wizard**, a powerful planar specialist adept at manipulating boundaries between worlds.  
     Sources: [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] (SECRET block), [[Avatus]]
   The mirror binds twelve extradimensional prison cells and becomes his preferred tool for **imprisoning dangerous enemies**, especially magic‑users he cannot trust in mundane prisons.  

 **Court wizard’s legacy.**  
   The court wizard’s **apprentice** later steals the mirror after Avatus’s defeat at the hands of [[Derik I]], fleeing south with the artifact and other treasure.  
   This apprentice founds a small hobgoblin “backwater slave empire” on the fringes of civilization, passing the mirror down a family line; her granddaughter **[[Revaka]]** eventually rules the remnant and is later trapped in the mirror herself by [[Cha'mutte]].  
     Sources: [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] (SECRET), [[Revaka]].  
   Revaka is explicitly noted as the **granddaughter of Avatus’s hobgoblin court wizard**, which ties the mirror and Revaka’s later micro‑kingdom directly to Avatus’s court.  

### Military Campaigns & the War with Sembara

#### Broad historical framing

Global chronology:  
(CY:: 5562) – Defeat of Avatus and the founding of modern Sembara. This corresponds to roughly **(DR:: 1429)** via the Drankorian‑to‑Dwarven conversion.  
     Source: [[Canonical Events]], [[Timeline of Sembaran History]].  
   Sembara in this era is newly consolidating from post‑Drankor fragmentation; Avatus and Tyrwingha are the major southern powers constraining Sembaran expansion.  

#### Campaign timeline (Sembaran perspective)

From [[Timeline of Sembaran History]]:

(DR:: 1422): Avatus conquers most of the **[[Duchy of Brovna]]**, but dwarven resistance (supported by [[Ardlas]]) keeps him from pushing north through mountain passes.  
(DR:: 1425), summer: Avatus invades [[Sembara]].  
(DR:: 1425), summer: He defeats the Sembaran army at the **[[Battle of Stavenford]]**.  
 (DR:: 1425), late fall: Sembaran forces abandon the lands between the [[Enst]] and [[Wistel]] rivers and retreat to [[Wisford]] for winter; Avatus consolidates gains.  
 (DR:: 1426), summer: [[Derik I]] returns with Tyrwinghan and Telhamite support, pushing Avatus south of the Wistel at the **[[Battle of Wisford]]**.  
 (DR:: 1427), summer: Derik pushes Avatus south of the Enst at the **[[Battle of Fellburn]]**.  
 (DR:: 1428), spring–summer: Derik campaigns south of the Enst, carrying the war into former Avatus territory.  
 (DR:: 1429), spring: Derik defeats Avatus at the decisive **[[Battle of Dalfield]]**.  
 (DR:: 1429), late fall: The **[[Treaty of Wisford]]** formalizes Derik’s new order, codifying modern Sembara and cementing the [[House of Sewick]] as rulers of the joined crowns of Sembara, [[Tyrwingha]], and [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]].  
 (DR:: 1430), summer–fall: Derik campaigns in the [[Mostreve Hills]] and signs the **[[Treaty of Valarin]]** with the emergent [[Istabor Alliance]], setting Sembara’s southern frontier at the edge of Avatus’s former dominion.  
 (DR:: 1432): Derik formally establishes new border polities—[[Duchy of Maseau]], [[Barony of Aveil]], [[Barony of Dunfry]], and the [[Marches of Enford|Barony of Enford]]—in lands previously controlled by Avatus and restores [[Duchy of Brovna|Brovna]].  

#### Tyrwinghan & prophetic narrative

 A more mythic account in [[Tyrwingha  Ideas]] (and older “GDrive – Sembara Document”) presents Avatus/[[Avatus]] as a **military dictator ravaging Sembara** with hobgoblins and werewolves while prophets in Tyrwingha proclaim looming End Times.  
 The Sembaran dukes’ pleas for aid are initially ignored; Tyrwingha’s queen is paralyzed by prophetic nightmares of her realm’s downfall if she intervenes.  
 Into this crisis rides **Derik I**, already a minor hero from pirate skirmishes, who receives a prophecy from a **lizardfolk elder**: if he does not overthrow **Avatus**, the “smallest cloud in the coming storm,” future horrors will be much worse.  
 When Derik lands in Tyrwingha, the Archfey **[[Ethlenn]]** appears, blesses him, and endorses him as king; his subsequent victory over Avatus and the [[Treaty of Wisford]] become the basis for the **unification of the crowns** of Sembara, Tyrwingha, and Telham.  

#### Cleenseau‑specific events

 In [[Cleenseau History Notes]]:  
   Avatus sacks the Drankorian tower on the south bank of the Enst in the early 1420s, breaking its longstanding magical protections.  
   He uses a **dimension door link** from the captured fort to an underground staging area under the north bank, enabling surprise attacks behind Sembaran lines and contributing to the defeat at Stavenford.  
   During occupation (DR 1425–1427), Cleenseau serves as a major logistics hub and base for Avatus’s army.  
   The halfling Stonebridges negotiate an uneasy accommodation, running [[The Crossroads Inn]] under hobgoblin oversight while secretly maintaining tunnels to help humans escape.  

#### Cha'mutte’s role

 Older texts (e.g., **[[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]]**) describe [[Cha'mutte]] as the **hidden puppet master** behind the Dominion of Avatus, who, after Avatus’s defeat, shifts his attention north and eventually triggers the [[Great War]].  
 Later Discord chats suggest Avatus was **not explicitly allied** with Cha'mutte and that Cha'mutte was not yet punishing hobgoblins for refusing to serve, implying a more indirect or background influence.  
   Sources: [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]], [[Discord Chat  Avatus and Hobgolbins]], [[Discord Chat  Sembara History]].  

### Legacy & Remnants

 **Political restructuring.**  
   Derik I’s post‑war reforms carve Avatus’s former territories into new duchies and baronies (notably [[Duchy of Maseau]]), placing them under more directly crown‑controlled lords and drastically reshaping the political map south of Sembara.  
     Source: [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]].  

 **Cultural echo.**  
   In later centuries, “Avatus” functions as a shorthand for a brutal hobgoblin‑backed autocrat. Places like Maseau and Aurbez are described as being **resettled** after the Dominion’s defeat, with pre‑Avatus political structures largely irrelevant to later history.  
     Sources: [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], “GDrive – Sembara Document”, [[Discord Chat  Upper Istaros Region]].  

 **Military and hobgoblin remnants.**  
   After Avatus’s fall, hobgoblin remnants—some loyal, some opportunistic—persist along the southern [[Sentinel Range]] and nearby Plaguelands, occasionally forming warbands that menace Sembara until the Great War and subsequent Blood Years reshape the region.  
     Sources: [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]], [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]].  
   Survivors of Avatus’s armies provide the backdrop for later hobgoblin conflicts (e.g., the [[Shattered Ice Clan]], the [[Bloodlust Wars]], and the northern/southern hobgoblin armies of the Great War).  

 **Magical relics and infrastructure.**  
   The **Mirror of Soul Trapping** passes out of Avatus’s direct control with his defeat but continues to influence history for centuries through Revaka’s line and later through [[Agata]] in the Dunmari campaigns.  
     Sources: [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], [[Revaka]], [[Dunmar Fellowship Associates]].  
   The **Avatus tunnels** and lair beneath the Drankorian fort at Cleenseau remain dangerous centuries later, serving as the origin point of an undead plague awakened by a lich‑king in the Cleenseau campaign.  
     Sources: [[Hobgoblin Camp]], [[Cleenseau History Notes]], “discorddmlogthrough20250116 – Avatus dimension door discussion”.  

 **Addermarch & ranger traditions.**  
   Discussion notes suggest the **rangers of Addermarch** may trace some of their origins to guerrilla fighters who resisted Avatus in the hills, contributing to the region’s identity as stubbornly unconquered highlands.  
     Source: [[Discord Chat  Addermarch]].  

> For cursed serpentine artifacts linked to Avatus‑era tombs in Addermarch (e.g., dagger and battleaxe), see [[Avatus Cursed Items Timeline]] for detail; they are not re‑summarized here.

### Timeline of Events (Avatus‑related)

Approximate, focusing on Avatus and his dominion rather than later mirror history.

 **Pre‑1420s DR (brainstormed):** Avatus, a rising warlord‑emperor on Sembara’s southern border, consolidates control over scattered hill baronies, builds a hobgoblin‑heavy army, and commissions the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]  via his hobgoblin court wizard.  
 **(DR:: 1420)** – [[Derik I]] marries into the [[Duchy of Telham]], beginning his rise in Sembaran politics.  
 **(DR:: 1422)** – Avatus conquers most of [[Duchy of Brovna]] but fails to break through dwarven defenses; at roughly the same time, Derik distinguishes himself in the [[Castrota Pirate War]].  
 **Early 1420s** – Avatus sacks the Drankorian tower at [[Cleenseau]] and establishes a dimension‑door‑linked lair beneath the fort, using it to project force north of the [[Enst]].  
   Source: [[Cleenseau History Notes]], [[Hobgoblin Camp]].  
 **(DR:: 1425)** – Avatus invades Sembara, defeating the royal army at [[Battle of Stavenford]]; Sembara retreats between the Enst and Wistel.  
 **(DR:: 1425–1426)** – Avatus occupies key southern Sembaran territories and consolidates; Cleenseau becomes a major staging base.  
 **(DR:: 1425–1426)** – Derik I receives prophecy, is crowned in [[Tyrwingha]] with Archfey [[Ethlenn]]’s blessing, and begins organizing a counter‑offensive (mythic account).  
   Source: [[Tyrwingha  Ideas]].  
 **(DR:: 1426–1427)** – Derik wins the Battles of **Wisford** and **Fellburn**, pushing Avatus south of the Wistel and then the Enst.  
 **(DR:: 1428–1429)** – Derik carries the war into Avatus’s dominion; the Battle of **Dalfield** destroys Avatus’s field army and effectively ends his rule.  
 **(DR:: 1430–1432)** – Derik campaigns in the [[Mostreve Hills]], negotiates with the [[Istabor Alliance]], and formally reorganizes former Avatus territories into new duchies and baronies (Maseau, Aveil, Dunfry, Enford, restored Brovna).  
 **Post‑1430s** – Hobgoblin remnants settle in or near the southern [[Sentinel Range]]; Avatus’s court wizard’s line, via the stolen mirror, forms a minor hobgoblin kingdom on Dunmar’s fringes (later ruled by [[Revaka]]).  
 **Later centuries** – Avatus’s dominion becomes a historical reference point for Sembaran border politics and for the origins of certain hobgoblin enclaves and artifacts, but no direct successor state emerges.  

### Possible Inconsistencies / Conflicts

 **Name: [[Avatus]] vs [[Avatus]].**  
   Older documents and chats use **[[Avatus]]**; newer notes, person records, and timelines use **Avatus**. The overlap of dates, events, and relationships (e.g., hobgoblin court wizard, war with Derik I) makes it clear these are intended to be the same figure.  
   Implication: treat [[Avatus]] spelling as legacy/variant; Avatus is the canonical form going forward.  ***RESOLVED BY MERGING FILES AND AUTORENAME***

 **Species and nature.**  
   [[Avatus]] currently lists him as a human emperor, but internal DM commentary leaves this open, with some preference for a **hobgoblin** or more unusual origin to make him stand out.  
   Chat notes explicitly suggest making him “a bit more unique/powerful” than a generic hobgoblin or human without fully defining his nature.  
   Implication: species is intentionally ambiguous; many NPCs might disagree about whether he was human, hobgoblin, or something else.  

 **Relationship to Cha'mutte.**  
   [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]] calls Cha'mutte the **“hidden puppet master”** of the Dominion of Avatus, whose defeat pushes Cha'mutte to refocus on the north.  
   Discord discussions, however, emphasize that Avatus **was not explicitly allied** with Cha'mutte, and that Cha'mutte was not yet punishing hobgoblins who refused to join him during the Domain of [[Avatus]] period.  
   Implication: canon can treat Cha'mutte’s influence as **indirect**—perhaps cults or advisors linked to him operate within the Dominion—while Avatus himself remains a separately motivated autocrat.  

 **Cleenseau’s fate under Avatus.**  
   [[Cleenseau History Notes]] describes the town as captured, with the population largely enslaved but not massacred; the halfling Stonebridges cut a deal with Avatus.  
   Some older chats briefly floated the idea that Avatus might not sack Cleenseau at all but instead have an uneasy truce; those were later folded back into the “captured but not annihilated” version now recorded in the history note.  
   Implication: treat Cleenseau History Notes as canonical; chat alternatives are superseded.  

 **Addermarch’s status.**  
   The Sembaran timeline speaks broadly of “lands formerly controlled by Avatus” being reorganized into duchies (including [[Duchy of Maseau]]), which might suggest more extensive conquest.  
   More recent Addermarch‑specific brainstorming strongly prefers that **Addermarch was never fully conquered**, instead serving as a hard‑to‑subdue frontier and guerrilla theater.  
   Implication: Avatus likely **threatened and invaded** parts of Addermarch’s periphery but never established stable dominion over its core hills.  

 **Mirror and Vault chronology.**  
   The Mirror’s secret origin text places its commission “about 150 years before the Great War,” which, depending on conversion, can be read as **late 1300s DR**, slightly earlier than the DR 1420s start date given for Avatus’s dominion.  
   Implication: magical projects’ timelines are approximate; a reasonable synthesis is that Avatus began commissioning major works a few decades before his open campaigns in Sembara.  

 **Werewolves and supernatural troops.**  
   [[Tyrwingha  Ideas]] emphasizes werewolves as a distinctive part of [[Avatus]]’s army; more recent summaries of the Dominion focus primarily on hobgoblins and generic “vicious forces.”  
   Implication: werewolves can be treated as a **regional/folk emphasis** in Tyrwingha’s oral traditions rather than a universally remembered fact.  

### Open Questions

 **What exactly was Avatus?**  
   Human, hobgoblin, something else, or a hybrid? Was “Emperor” a title granted by followers, or did he claim a more esoteric origin tied to Drankor or even to embodied gods?  

 **Full extent of the Dominion.**  
   How far east and west did Avatus’s overlordship run beyond the Mostreve Hills? Did he directly control regions that later become [[Duchy of Maseau]] and parts of [[Istabor Alliance]], or were some only tributary?  

 **Capital and major strongholds.**  
   Where was Avatus’s main capital? The Cleenseau lair and mirror‑holding dungeon are significant, but presumably not his principal palace. A named capital and seat of power are still undefined.  

 **Court wizard’s identity.**  
   The hobgoblin court mage is currently unnamed. Defining their name, personality, and broader works (other artifacts, rituals, seer contacts) would clarify Avatus‑era lore and Revaka’s ancestry.  

 **Connection to Avatus‑era cursed items.**  
   Several cursed artifacts in Addermarch (e.g., **serpentine weapons** recovered from Avatus tombs) may be relics of his regime or earlier Drankorian experiments co‑opted by his dominion. To what extent were these weapons part of a deliberate program (e.g., a “serpentine armory”) versus isolated creations?  

 **Cha'mutte’s influence on Avatus’s rise.**  
   If Cha'mutte is not directly allied with Avatus, did he manipulate events from afar, seed cults within Avatus’s ranks, or simply take advantage of the aftermath of Avatus’s fall?  

 **Addermarch’s internal history during the wars.**  
   What specific campaigns, sieges, and guerrilla actions took place in Addermarch during the Avatus wars? How did those shape current ranger orders, noble houses, and haunted sites?  

### Notes on Sources

 **More canonical / up‑to‑date:**  
   [[Timeline of Sembaran History]] – main high‑level chronology for Avatus and Derik I.  
   [[Cleenseau History Notes]] – detailed account of Cleenseau during Avatus’s wars.  
   [[Avatus]] – basic biographical sketch, including “New Drankorian Emperor” flavor.  
   [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]] & [[Revaka]] – detailed backstory of Avatus’s court wizard, the mirror’s creation, and its post‑Avatus history.  
  
 **Older or explicitly provisional:**  
   [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]] – superseded in places by Timeline of Sembaran History but still useful for flavor (especially Cha'mutte as puppet‑master).  
   [[Tyrwingha  Ideas]] and “GDrive – Sembara Document” – mythic narrative of [[Avatus]]/Avatus and Derik I, strong on Tyrwinghan perspective and prophecy but written as brainstorming.  
   [[Discord Chat  Avatus and Hobgolbins]], [[Discord Chat  Sembara History]], [[Discord Chat  Addermarch]], [[Discord Chat  History of Western Green Sea]] – rich for intent and vibe, but not always aligned with later writeups; good guidance for tone and unresolved questions.  

## Intervening History: Fall of Drankor to Derik I (AI Summary)

Codex summary

This section aggregates major events and developments across the setting between the **Fall of Drankor in (DR:: 1059)** and the rise of [[Derik I]] in the early 1400s DR.

### Post‑Drankor Collapse and Refugee Movements

The **[[First Plague]]** in (DR:: 1059) destroys [[Drankor]] and ends the [[Drankorian Empire]], killing most of the heartland population and cursing the region around the old capital.  
Sources: [[First Plague]], [[Drankorian Empire]], [[Canonical Events]], [[Historical Framework]].  
Large numbers of refugees, especially wizards and scholars, flee west to **[[Chardon]]**, which quickly becomes a major center of learning and trade.  
  (DR:: 1059): Population swells to ~20,000; defensive works expanded.  
  (DR:: 1072): Population reaches ~40,000; wooden palisade replaced with stone walls.  
  (DR:: 1099): Population reaches ~60,000; stone wharves built; grain trade from the [[Chasa River Valley]] booms.  
   Sources: [[Chardon]], [[Great Library]], [[University of Chardon]].  

The **[[Great Library]]** in Chardon grows out of the **Sibyline Archives**; following the fall of Drankor, it is expanded in (DR:: 1063) to preserve rescued imperial knowledge.  
   Source: [[Great Library]].  
 The fall of Drankor reshapes river names and identities: the **[[Istaros]]** (Aistanë) name is increasingly used by human cultures in the years after the plague, replacing older Drankorian terms.  
   Source: [[Istaros]].  

### Rise of Dunmar and Eastern Realignment

 Immediately after the First Plague, the **[[Dunmar|Dunmari]] migration** crosses into the devastated heartland, cleansing lingering plague‑magic and founding a new realm atop Drankor’s ruins.  
   In CY‑dating: (CY:: 5304) Dunmari migration reaches the [[Istaros|Mahar]], (CY:: 5306) Dunmar conquers and consolidates the basin.  
   Sources: [[Canonical Events]], [[Historical Framework]], [[Bhishma]], [[Dunmar]].  
Towns like **[[Tokra]]** are resettled as minor outposts in the late 1100s DR, anchoring Dunmar’s overland routes:  
  (DR:: 1183): Tokra resettled by Dunmari settlers.  
  (DR:: 1184): The **[[Lakan Monastery]]** is founded nearby.  
   Sources: [[Tokra]], [[Elven Arborea Workshop]].  
The Lakan monks uncover and begin studying older elven and planar sites (e.g., an **[[Extraplanar Weak Point]]** to [[Arborea]]) in the 1100s–1300s DR, establishing Dunmar as a key locus of post‑Drankorian magical scholarship.  
  (DR:: 1194): Lakan monastery founded atop ruined elven workshop.  
   (DR:: 1387): Lakan monks excavate the elven cave system and rediscover the weak point.  
   Source: [[Elven Arborea Workshop]].  

### Formation of the Six Duchies and Sembaran Core

 By **(DR:: 1142)**, **[[Adrian]]** establishes himself in [[Embry]] as the first **Duke of Sembara**, marking the start of distinct post‑Drankorian Sembaran polity. 
   Sources: [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[Canonical Events]].  
  
  By **(DR:: 1250)**, the **Six Duchies era** is in full swing: coastal lowland polities have stabilized into the duchies that later form the heart of Sembara—[[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], [[Duchy of Wisford|Wisford]], [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]], [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], and [[Duchy of Arnsbury|Arnsbury]].  
  
   At the same time, border duchies [[Marches of Brovna|Brovna]] and [[Ardlas]] emerge in the highlands; [[Tyrwingha]] consolidates under the [[Oracle of the Riven]] and [[Archfey Ethlenn]].  
   Source: [[Timeline of Sembaran History]].  
 To the south, the **[[Istabor Alliance]]** begins coalescing in fertile lands vacated or weakened by Drankor’s fall, drawing migrants away from marginal land in Sembara’s hinterlands.  
   Source: [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[Historical Framework]].  

### Growth of Chardon as a Post‑Imperial Hub

In the centuries after Drankor’s fall, **Chardon** transforms from a provincial city into a major intellectual and economic hub:  
The **[[University of Chardon]]** expands in (DR:: 1065), integrating refugee scholars and solidifying Chardon’s academic identity.  
  By the 1200s–1300s DR, Chardon’s **paper mills** and industrial infrastructure (e.g., the [[Mill Channel]] and [[River Bridge (Chardon)|River Bridge]]) fuel a growing magical‑industrial economy.  
  (DR:: 1324): Population reaches ~100,000; old city walls take their current shape.  
  (DR:: 1366–1374): Major waterworks and the River Bridge are built.  
   Sources: [[Chardon]], [[Great Library]], [[University of Chardon]], [[Greater Chardon]].  

### Broader Cultural and Religious Shifts

 The **Kestavan** and mariner religious traditions in the north gradually give way to **Mos Numena** and Dunmari‑style worships in the post‑Drankorian centuries, though older folk practices persist in highlands and among the [[Zimkova]].  
   Sources: [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], “GDrive – Sembara Document”.  
 The **Dunmari Pantheon**, especially [[Bhishma]] and the **Five Siblings**, becomes central to the spiritual identity of Dunmar, explicitly tied to cleansing the plague curse left by Drankor.  
   Sources: [[Bhishma]], [[Dunmar]], [[The Divine Order]].  


## Western Green Sea Historical Brainstorming (AI Summary)

(Codex summary  these are notably worse than previous AI summaries  I think because context is getting full)

Focus: **post‑Drankor, pre‑Great‑War** (roughly (DR:: 1059)–(DR:: 1462)) developments in the Western Green Sea and adjacent regions—Tollen, Cymea, Isingue/Istabor, the Istaros basin, Dunmar, Orenlas—leaving earlier Drankorian and later Great‑War/Blood Years details as context only. Where helpful, this section incorporates additional detail from Discord/email notes such as [[Discord Chat  Green Sea]], [[Email  Skaer]], [[Isingue Notes]], and [[Email  Player Background on Aurbez]].

### Tollen and Tollish Power after Drankor

 After the **First Plague** destroys Drankor (DR:: 1059), Tollen emerges from Drankorian oversight as a **fully independent city‑state** rather than a de‑facto protectorate.  
   Previously, under the [[Treaty of Marhavn]], Tollen’s foreign policy was effectively controlled by Drankor while it retained “Free City” status; with the imperial center gone, Tollender merchant houses have space to maneuver.  
   Sources: [[Tollen]], [[Drankorian Empire]], [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]].  
 11th–13th centuries DR:  
   Tollen capitalizes on its **mixed Drankorian–Skaer–Zimka heritage**, becoming a conduit between:  
     Sembaran lowlands and highlands.  
     The recovering Drankorian hinterland and emerging Dunmar.  
     Coastal Vostok, the Skaer islands, and Cymea.  
   The **[[University of Tollen]]** grows into a serious center of magical learning, rivaled in the Western Green Sea only by some Cymean institutions and later by Chardon on the western edge.  
   Sources: [[Tollen]], [[University of Tollen]], [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]].  
 By the **1300s–early 1400s DR**, Tollen is a **major mercantile and intellectual node**:  
   Its fleets and caravans move along the Vostok coast and toward Cymea, though full Tollender control of the Straits of Cymea is a **post‑Great‑War** development; in this era, Tollen is growing into that role rather than fully owning it.  
   Tollish culture spreads south into [[Duchy of Telham]] and along the coast, blending with Sembaran and Zimkovan traditions.

### Cymea and Istabor between Plague and Great War

 At the **moment of Drankor’s fall**, the western Green Sea coast and Istabor valley are firmly organized as wealthy Drankorian provinces (cotton + grain belts) with strong cultural ties to the imperial core.  
   Brainstorming notes stress that both [[Cymea]] and [[~South Cymea~]] are long‑term Drankorian provinces, built atop lands that were once a vast lizardfolk swamp and elven forest; by the fall of Drankor, northern Cymea is strongly Drankorian in culture and religion.  
   Sources: [[Green Sea Brainstorming]], [[Drankorian Empire]], [[Drankorian Empire  Open Questions]].  
 11th–12th centuries DR:  
   With the imperial center shattered, **Cymean coastal provinces** and **Istabor lowlands** continue under local elites—governors, military officers, or merchant magnates—who inherit Drankorian infrastructure but lose central coordination.  
   Trade continues through local ports and overland routes, but becomes more regionally focused (e.g., to Tollen, early Dunmar, and nearby city‑states) rather than empire‑wide.  
   At the same time, former Skaer coastal enclaves in Cymea retreat culturally back toward the Skaerhem and northern Green Sea, leaving only thin Skaer footprints where Drankor was entrenched.  
   Sources: [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Green Sea Brainstorming]], [[Historical Framework]], [[Email  Skaer]].  
 1200s–1300s DR:  
   Cymea remains **prosperous but politically fragmented**. City‑states and minor realms flourish along the coast and islands, claiming Drankorian heritage and competing for influence.  
   The **Istabor valley city‑states** (later formalized as the [[Istabor Alliance]]) grow wealthy off river trade and agricultural production, interacting with Dunmar to the east and Tollen/Sembara to the north and west.  
   In later centuries Cymea sees itself as the **heir of Drankor** in the western Green Sea—rich in magic, ruins, and old cities—but its political fragmentation and limited naval reach make it vulnerable to Tollender and halfling dominance at sea.

### Isingue and the Proto‑Istabor Alliance

 **[[Isingue]]** is a Drankorian‑derived culture centered east of the Mostreve Hills and north of the Istabor valley. After the fall of Drankor, it remains culturally Drankorian but increasingly autonomous.  
   Its language and religious practice (Mos Numena variants) are closely related to those of southern Sembara and Cymean provinces, but it retains distinct traditions and elites.  
   Source: [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Languages]].  
 Between DR 1200–1400:  
   Isingue and neighboring city‑states in the Istabor valley form **regional leagues** for mutual defense and trade, precursors to the more formal [[Istabor Alliance]] described in Great‑War‑era notes.  
   The Istabor river corridor acts as a principal conduit between Cymea, Dunmar, and Tollen/Sembara, with Isinguese merchants heavily involved.  
   Sources: [[Istabor Alliance]], “GDrive – Sembara Document”, [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]].  
 By the **early 1400s DR**, when [[Derik I]] is fighting Avatus, the Istabor region is already a complex patchwork of small powers recognizable as the **proto‑Istabor Alliance** Sembara later signs the [[Treaty of Valarin]] with (DR:: 1430).

### Istaros Watershed and Aurbez in this Era

 After Drankor’s fall, the **[[Istaros Watershed]]** transitions from a Drankorian core corridor to a **multi‑polar frontier** among Dunmar, Isingue/Istabor, Cymea, and emerging Sembaran influence:  
   Dunmar’s early Aatmaji campaigns stabilize the upper basin and eastern Hara side.  
   Isinguese and Istabor cities dominate the mid‑basin trade routes.  
   Sembara and Tollen plug into the system from the northwest via valleys like the [[Andonne]].  
   Later meta‑discussion suggests that the upheaval that created the Plaguelands and Yuvanti mountains may have **disrupted the Istaros system**, so the exact hydrology remembered in later ages (e.g., which tributaries still connect to the Mahar vs. draining into the Plaguelands) may differ from this earlier era.  
   Sources: [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Aurbez and the Andonne]], [[Geography of Taelgar]], [[Historical Framework]], [[Discord Chat  History]], [[discorddmlogthrough20250116]].  
 **[[Aurbez and the Andonne]]** in this pre‑Great‑War window is not yet the “Refounded Alliance” of later centuries, but the **Andonne corridor** is already a key:  
   It connects Maseau/Sembara to Istabor/Isingue and Cymea.  
   Its towns serve as transshipment points for western goods heading toward Dunmar (via overland routes) and eastern wares moving toward Tollen and Sembara.  
   Sources: [[Aurbez and the Andonne]], [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Upper Istaros Region]].  

### Dunmar’s Western Connections Before the Great War

 In **pre‑Great‑War centuries** (before DR:: 1462), Dunmar:  
   Consolidates control of the Hara Basin, while building roads and caravan routes through the mountains toward [[Chardon]] and the upper Istaros.  
   Uses **[[Tokra]]** and other frontier centers as administrative and military hubs facing west, ensuring stability along trade paths that link to Cymea and Istabor.  
   Sources: [[Dunmar]], [[Tokra]], [[Elven Arborea Workshop]], [[Historical Framework]].  
 While Dunmar does not project naval power into the Western Green Sea, its **overland trade** is crucial: western goods (from Tollen, Sembara, Cymea, Istabor) pass east through Dunmari markets toward the Great Library and eastern realms.  
   Sources: [[Greater Dunmar]], [[Great Library]], [[Historical Framework]].  

### Orenlas and the Western Green Sea (1059–1462)

 After the Downfall and Drankorian expansion, **[[Orenlas]]** is one of the few surviving elven enclaves in the western part of the world. In the post‑Drankor centuries it:  
   Maintains a **careful neutrality**, trading selectively with Dunmar, Isingue/Istabor, and Addermarch/Sembara while avoiding deep entanglement in human wars.  
   Serves as a source of rare elven goods and lore for select human and Dunmari patrons (e.g., the Great Library, Tollen, or Dunmari monasteries) who can negotiate access.  
   Sources: [[Historical Framework]], [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Orenlas]] notes.  
 Green‑Sea brainstorming mentions a **Drankorian lake‑city near Orenlas** that survives into this era as a magical craft center before later vanishing; this city likely acts as a conduit between Orenlas and Drankorian‑derived coastal cultures (Isingue, Cymea) during the 1100s–1300s DR.  
   Source: [[Green Sea Brainstorming]].  

### Western Green Sea Trade (1059–1462)

 In this period, the **main long‑distance trade pattern** around the Western Green Sea is:  
   **Tollen ↔ Vostok/Ursk** along the northern coast (furs, metals, dyes).  
   **Tollen/Sembara ↔ Istabor/Isingue/Cymea** via the Istaros/Andonne basin.  
   **Istabor/Cymea ↔ Dunmar** via the Mahar/Hara overland routes.  
   Halfling fleets and scattered Cymean ships supplement this network, but the fully Tollender‑dominated straits and deep east‑west halfling routes described in later notes are **post‑Great‑War developments**.  
   In this era, Cymean merchants still see themselves as natural brokers of east–west trade, even as Tollender reliability and shipbuilding slowly outpace Cymea’s more fractured fleets.

### Open Questions for 1059–1462

 Exact political makeup of **Cymea** and **Istabor** in this window (which city‑states exist when, how alliances shift) is intentionally under‑defined.  
 [[Isingue]]’s internal structure and borders are mostly sketched via diaspora and later history; pre‑destruction details are still open for development.  
 The role of **Orenlas** in specific conflicts (e.g., whether it aided any side during the Avatus wars or early Great War maneuvering) has not been specified.  
 The balance between **Tollen** and **Cymea** as maritime powers over time between 1059–1462—when, exactly, one eclipses the other—is still loosely described and can be tuned to campaign needs.

**Istaros River & Watershed (pre–DR 1545)**

 The Istaros (originally Aistanë, “blessed water”) flows from Lake Aeulian in the Mostreve Hills to the Sea of Storms, and its watershed has long been the lifeblood of fortune and empire, forming the core corridor first of the Drankorian Empire and later of the Istabor Alliance. [[Istaros]], [[Geography of Taelgar]], [[Historical Framework]]
 During the Drankorian Founding Period (CY 4133–4483), the previously sparsely settled Istaros Watershed was heavily colonized; by late Drankorian times the Istabor valley was one of three especially wealthy agricultural provinces, focused on grain and cotton and closely tied to coastal South Cymea. [[Historical Framework]], [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Green Sea Brainstorming]]
 Upper‑river geography notes describe the ridges west of the Istaros and the basin around Lake Aeulian/Valmont as a wide, exceptionally fertile heartland of villages, streams, and farms later remembered as the agricultural core of the Istabor Alliance. [[Upper Istaros]], [[Aurbez and the Andonne]], [[Istaros]]
 After Drankor’s fall (DR 1059 and following), the Istaros Watershed becomes a multi‑polar frontier: Dunmari migration crosses it and splits there, Isinguese and Istabor cities dominate mid‑basin routes, and Sembara/Tollen connect from the northwest via corridors like the Andonne. [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Avatus Brainstorming  Summaries]], [[Aurbez and the Andonne]]
 The confluence of the Istaros and Thalúrien near Isingue is long believed to carry special blessing; its waters were said to grant exceptional fertility to soil and people, making the surrounding lands the mystical and cultural center of what becomes the Istabor Alliance. [[Istaros]], [[Thalurien]], [[Isingue]]

**Istabor Valley & Istabor Alliance (pre–DR 1545)**

 The Istabor Alliance is a loose alliance of city‑states and their hinterlands in the fertile Istabor (upper Istaros) valley; it exists as a distinct realm before the Great War and is destroyed during that conflict, leaving its rich river valleys as the Plaguelands. [[Istabor Alliance]], [[Istaros]], [[Timeline of Sembaran History]]
 After Drankor’s collapse, the valley’s Drankorian provinces evolve into wealthy city‑states that see themselves as Drankorian heirs, growing rich on river‑borne agriculture and trade with Dunmar to the east and Sembara/Tollen to the north and west. [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Green Sea Brainstorming]], [[Avatus Brainstorming  Summaries]]
 By the Six Duchies era (~DR 1250), Sembaran histories already speak of the “fertile lands of the Istabor Alliance” to the far south, drawing settlers away from marginal Sembaran lands—evidence of an organized, prosperous region even before the Alliance’s later Great‑War‑era prominence. [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]]
 Between roughly DR 1200–1400, regional leagues in the valley coalesce into a recognizable proto‑Istabor Alliance; by DR 1429–1430, after defeating Avatus, Derik I signs the Treaty of Valarin with this emergent Alliance, fixing Sembara’s southern frontier at the edge of former Avatus dominion. [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[Avatus Brainstorming  Summaries]], [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]]
 In the early Great‑War period (reign of Derik II), Sembaran chronicles describe the southern border with the Istabor Alliance as peaceful with growing trade, while older notes on Cha’mutte and hobgoblin deployments say hobgoblin footholds in the southern Sentinels are intended to keep the Alliance from consolidating into a single strong kingdom. [[Timeline of Sembaran History]], [[A Chronicle of Sembaran History]], [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]], [[Avatus Brainstorming  Summaries]]
 Brainstorm and Discord notes suggest an earlier or alternative name such as “Isatabor Alliance” and emphasize a shared identity across many small towns and rural communities around Isingue and the valley, seeing themselves as part of a single Istabor/Isinguese cultural sphere tied together by the river and its magical waters. [[Isingue]], [[Green Sea Brainstorming]], [[discorddmlogthrough20250116.txt]]

**Isingue & Isinguese Culture (pre–DR 1545)**

 Isingue is a city on the upper Istaros that served as the cultural and spiritual capital of the Istabor Alliance, founded (in legend) where the river’s waters granted magical, life‑giving power to land and people; dense belts of prosperous small towns and villages around it drew wealth from this unusual fertility. [[Isingue]], [[Istaros]]
 The Thalúrien (Taloraine) joins the Istaros at Isingue; ancient elvish lore associates Thalúrien with purity and thought and Aistanë/Istaros with growth and fertility, while Isinguese names for nearby rivers (Nimrata for Naithalë, Velonere for Velassë, Taloraine for Thalúrien) and stories of dangerous or forgetful waters show a strong local river‑lore. [[Thalurien]], [[Naithale]], [[Velasse]], [[Istaros]], [[Isingue]]
 Drankorian‑expansion notes say the Istabor valley and Cymea had few humans before Drankor; in the 5th century DR, Drankor settles them heavily, making Maseau and the Istaros watershed—including the proto‑Isingue province—some of the most purely Drankorian provinces in language, culture, and Mos Numena worship. [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], [[Historical Framework]], [[Green Sea Brainstorming]]
 Post‑plague, human‑culture and Green‑Sea notes describe Isinguese culture as Drankorian‑derived but increasingly autonomous: a wealthy agricultural heartland and urban center (built heavily on cotton) that inherits Drankorian traditions yet develops its own elites, language variant, and religious inflection. [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], [[Green Sea Brainstorming]], [[Avatus Brainstorming  Summaries]], [[Isingue]]
 Discord‑embedded notes emphasize a contrast with Cymea: post‑Drankor Isingue rejects imperial ritualism in favor of more mystical/divine Mos Numena practice, is organized around many small self‑governing towns and “town‑meeting” style local rule, and treats Isingue more as a spiritual/cultural focal point than as an enormous metropolis. [[Isingue]], [[Discord Chat  History of Western Green Sea]], [[discorddmlogthrough20250116.txt]]
 Pre‑Great‑War trade and diplomacy put Isingue on key overland routes: the ancient Great South Road runs Embry → Cassons → Isingue and in Drankorian times continued almost 2500 miles to Drankor; other notes mention a major north–south route Cleenseau → Maseau → Isingue and strong trade Cymea ↔ Isingue ↔ Chardon, with high‑level councils between Chardon, Sembara, and Isingue often conducted in Drankorian as a shared diplomatic language. [[Great South Road]], [[Duchy of Maseau]], [[Cassons]], [[Email  Green Sea Trade Routes]], [[discorddmlogthrough20250116.txt]]
 Setting summaries describe Isinguese culture as “purely Drankorian” in origin but distinct after the fall of Drankor, and state that the territorial culture is destroyed when Isingue falls to Cha’mutte’s plague at the end of the Great War (DR 1545); afterward (beyond your requested timeframe) Isinguese identity persists in diaspora communities in places like Maseau, Aurbez, and Tollen. [[Human Cultures of Taelgar]], [[Isingue]], [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]], [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]], [[Guy Marchand]], [[Sarah de Gray]]
 Several meta notes suggest that The Rangers may originally have formed as guardians of the magical waters and land around Isingue, giving them a pre‑Great‑War origin tied to protecting that valley and explaining their later focus on Sembara’s southern frontier. [[Isingue]], [[The Rangers]], [[discorddmlogthrough20250116.txt]]
