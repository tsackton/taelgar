## On Wealth

synthesizing the email discussion about material abundance, intellectual property, what elves see as wealth, etc.

the basic framework is that elves are capable, via magic, of growing nearly anything, but this is not necessarily simple or easy in all cases. growing enough food and providing simple clothes, space to live, basic necessities, for all elves is the first priority, and except when under attack or otherwise disrupted from the normal balance of things, this is always possible and a fundamental aspect of elven civilization. there is no poverty in elven cities that said, this does not mean there are no differences in wealth. while elves find no reason to accumulate coin or gems in their raw form, they do value new things that are brought into the world, whether ideas/songs/stories/poems or physical things of beauty, or of practical value (although I think elven culture would usually tend towards beauty). building on the idea from the sisila tree fruit backstory from Delwath, one thing that determines wealth is that it is a privilege to be allowed to use rare materials. so you can't buy sisila fruit with money, but if you are recognized as a talented chef you are given one to bake with. exactly how this kind of resource allocation is managed in elven society can be handwaved a bit, but the key vibes aspect is that there are wealthy/non-wealthy elves in some sense, but wealth is measured in what you create. so a "poor" jeweler may often work with plain metals, and a "rich" jeweler may have the opportunity to craft in mithril. but there is also a "how far have your creations spread" aspect, and this is how you "get rich" - a "poor" jeweler who produces amazing designs in bronze and copper may get asked to make something with gold or mithral. this ties in to intellectual property too, as derivative work is less valued that new work

I think the details of this are a bit unnecessary to really know, but the implications in game would be:

1. elves would sometimes trade for material goods, as material abundance does not necessarily mean lack of scarcity entirely - but they wouldn't _need_ to do it
2. you still have a kind of status hierarchy based around perceived value of the new things you bring into the world. as a side note, this sets up a bit of dichotomy where "creators" are higher status than "doers". So Delwath, as a solider and quartermaster, would not necessarily be seen as a high status elf (although perhaps this is also a consequence of the great war - in the absence of war perhaps he would have been an amazing chef). i'm not sure this is exactly right, so maybe there is kind of a second, orthogonal hierarchy that is more oriented around caretaker roles, so you can be high status because you are a skilled commander or a talented wizard and not necessarily need to create something new
3. elven cities would feel weird to other races - there aren't markets in the usual sense, people aren't really buying food. there would be trees with fruit just kind of there, for example. maybe there would be occasional art shows, and lots of songs and storytelling, and things like that that would have subtle undercurrents of competition noticeably primarily to other elves

## On Governance and Society

the basic idea here I think is a bit more established, around the nurturer/caretaker distinction, the unifiers and the "trial of unity" idea, and the idea of each ka as kind of a collective unit that figures out how to reach consensus on their own the game implications are, I think:

1. you can't go to an elven city and say "take me to your leader" - there is no galadriel or elrond to speak to. however, I think that most elven settlements would have some people who are the outerward face of the community to visitors. perhaps with explicit titles like "Caretaker So-and-So".
2. if you are asking something of "elves" it should be a little unclear how decisions are made, although there is an opportunity to create a way to participate in a "trial by unity" if desired
3. there should probably not be a lot of internal, obvious factions in elvish society, except during times of debate and consensus-finding, and then those factions would be temporary. this is probably not a universal rule - decision points have to start somewhere and may start with a factional period. but once it is resolved, it is resolved.


## Politics

Certainly, let's delve deeper into crafting a unique and intriguing political structure for Orenlas and Erelion (the main city in Orenlas), making them stand out as truly distinct from what humans might expect. Here are a few unusual ideas:  
  
1. **Age-Based Decision Making:**  
In Orenlas and Erelion, decision-making could be based on the concept of temporal wisdom. The older an elf is, the more weight their opinions carry in discussions. However, instead of having a single ruling council, decisions could be made by gathering representatives from different age groups, each contributing their perspective. This means that decisions could be a culmination of insights from various generations, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand. A unique twist could be that the eldest members speak their thoughts first, followed by progressively younger members, allowing for a harmonious interplay of experience and fresh viewpoints.  
  
2. **Wisdom Trees and Collective Memory:**  
In Erelion, there could exist ancient "Wisdom Trees" that serve as repositories of the accumulated knowledge, experiences, and insights of the elven community. These trees could be enchanted with magic that allows elves to commune with them and access the memories stored within their wood. When important decisions need to be made, elves could gather around these trees, entering a trance-like state to tap into the collective wisdom of their ancestors. The trees themselves might offer guidance through faint whispers, rustling leaves, or even projecting memories as vivid visions.  
  
3. **Council of Whispers:**  
In Erelion, the council of elders might not convene in a traditional sense. Instead, they gather during the night beneath the canopy of ancient trees, participating in a ritual known as the "Council of Whispers." Elves believe that the stars and the trees are connected through the threads of Elmerca's magic, allowing them to communicate with distant realms. The elders listen to the rustling leaves and watch the patterns of starlight to discern messages and insights from Elmerca. Their discussions might involve interpreting the patterns and sounds, merging both celestial and earthly guidance to make decisions.  
  
4. **Trial by Unity:**  
When conflicts arise or major decisions need to be made, Orenlas could employ a ritualistic approach called "Trial by Unity." Representatives from different generations form a circle around the ancient Living Tree, Aldanor. Through a shared meditation and attunement to the tree's energy, they become connected on a profound level. During this union, they experience each other's memories, emotions, and thoughts, fostering a deep understanding of each perspective. Once the unity ends, decisions are reached through a form of collective consciousness, where each elf has gained insight from others' experiences, guiding them towards consensus.  
  
5. **Eternal Reflection:**  
In Erelion, the council of elders could engage in a unique practice called "Eternal Reflection." Instead of meeting frequently, they gather only during certain celestial events or significant natural occurrences. During these gatherings, they spend extended periods in deep reflection, allowing their minds to explore the memories of their past, their connection to the forest, and their bond with Aldanor. They believe that this introspection brings forth insights that guide their society in ways that mere discussion cannot. Decisions might emerge as shared revelations rather than deliberate discussions.
