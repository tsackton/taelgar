working out some elven generational dynamics. lmk what you think. basic assumptions are from the demographics spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rMp9eP617CMDdkDgmDRPpOOUbO0TjTY17578DK2wPwo/edit#gid=838085721). assume that most elves survive to 800-900, but many choose to leave the world between 950 - 1150, so basic demographic structure then sets up 7 ka as the "current population", with anyone born more than 7 ka ago clearly a rare elder.

to put it in 1749 dynamics, you have:
37th ka (born in 1627 +/-), currently the youngest generation, and currently in their wandering/pre-parent phase
36th ka (born in 1467 +/-), the Great War generation, but also the current parental generation, probably sharing most responsibility for community management and governance with the 35th ka
35th ka (born in 1307 +/-), the 'grandparent' generation, probably the main pillar of elven society
34th ka (born in 1147 +/-), the youngest of the 'elder' generations, probably not yet leaving in great numbers,
33th ka (born in 987 +/-), the elders
32nd ka (born in 827 +/-), the oldest of the elder generations
31st ka (born in 667 +/-), the leaving generation, in the midst of departures, rapidly declining in numbers
30th ka and older (born before 507 +/-), the remaining generation, those who decided not to leave the world for whatever reason, small in number and hard to find


[10/30/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
basically you have, at any one time, one generation of "children", two generations of "adults", and three generations of "elders", and then the "post-elders" whatever, but the 7th ka in the past (31st in 1749) would be transitional between elders and "post-elders"


[10/30/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
at one point i thought you had sketched out some idea about transitions in responsbility among the ka but I can't find any notes at the moment


[10/30/2023 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
I had a sketch in email that was basically 3 roles:

The "nurturer", who watches over the young and the homeland
The "caretaker", who watches over the elder races (essentially in charge of foreign policy)
The "unifier", who mediates disputes


[10/30/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
and then an alternating pattern on which generation takes which role


[10/30/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
let me see if I can find what I wrote


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
ah I found it


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
It was in email, too big to paste here


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
in your "Dawn of Everything" worldbuilding phase


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
ha, yeah


[10/30/2023 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not wedded to that exact structure for elves, but I do like the idea of rotating leadership based on generations.


[10/30/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah mostly I am trying to figure out who in Orenlas would remember Drankor


[10/30/2023 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
i think from a game perspective it is better if these people are not a dime a dozen, seems weird that there would be mystery about history if most elves can remember 1000 years ago clearly


[10/30/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
I like the basic idea that you have nuturer / caretaker roles that alternate, but it might actually work better to speed up the "die off" of the oldest generations a bit


[10/30/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure most elves remember 1000 years ago clearly

[10/30/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
Also


[10/30/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
basically I want to set up a distinction between the bulk of elvish society that are in the wanderer / caretaker / nuturer phase and the elders who are beginning to think about leaving to happen around 3-4 generations in the phase


[10/30/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
*past


[10/30/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
but I think that works with your alternating scheme


[10/30/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I think basically they scheme I had no major role for anyone beyond current-2


[10/30/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
So the 34th ka and earlier, are the "elders" in current time


[10/30/2023 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
Also, consider that outside of the "caretaker" phase many elves might not pay that much attention to human history. And I really don't think elves necessarily remember everything clearly either. 

You can even  imagine a sort of intentional forgetting, as part of aging and the changing of the generations, where the focus of a specific elf changes


[10/30/2023 9:51 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[10/30/2023 9:52 AM] .deciusmus
I definitely agree that very old elves are rare, but I think there is probably a fair number of moderately old elves, i.e. who were alive during the Drankorian empire, but who just made no effort to remember that. They've been in the Feywild for 300 years, or whatever, and the mortal world isn't really a concern


[10/30/2023 9:52 AM] rsulfuratus
many very old elves for example may take on a ritual role (like unifiers in your email) and as part of that begin to shed their sense of their earlier life


[10/30/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
I like both an explicit magical/ritual change and also just normal forgetfulness


[10/30/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think this gets at what I wanted, there is kind of a transition around 3-4 ka ago from "normal old person" to "elder" that has very distinct and elven flavor


[10/30/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
some of that is just about forgetting, some about leaving to other planes, some about magic/ritual, etc, but it gives a flavor/transition point that is ~500-600 years ago


[10/30/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
have a meeting now but am going to sketch this out in a bit more detail later today

[11/3/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
working on a bit of elven history, thinking about ka and mela and leya. which do you like better:
1) during the first 30 years of each ka, at the beginning of mela, every elf who has not experienced a mela before is fertile and able to have children via a mystical process associated with the firstborn; once you have lived through a mela cycle, you are never again able to have children.
2) elves are fertile between roughly 150-180 years, and then cease to be fertile. so it is less mystical and more biological, and what matters is your age not your life experience


[11/3/2023 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
(1) is a little simpler for the first generation / getting things going, and ensures you don't get age drift where if the youngest have kids with youngest and oldest with oldest you tend to move towards overlapping generations over time. it also raises the possibility that Delwath didn't actually experience the last mela during the 37th ka


[11/3/2023 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) is maybe a little more straightforward and clear from the point of view of an elf PC as you can kind of figure out your age and where you fit


[11/3/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I went back and forth on this a lot when I was making up the mela and leya stuff


[11/3/2023 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm leaning towards 1 but not committed to it


[11/3/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I was mostly thinking about in turns of (2), both because
(a) I've largely been playing Delwath as someone who knows he can't have kids because he has missed his chance
(b) I didn't think of any other ideas

But the generation drift was a bit annoying, and you do by math potentially end up with drift. I was thinking of dealing with that via cultural ideas about mostly everyone has children in the first couple of years of coming back from mela, and also everyone of a ka leaves at the same time.

So even with some age variabilty, it would be unusual to have gen drift because someone who is born very early in the ka enters the marriage market so to speak at the same time as everyone else


[11/3/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
That said, adding more mysticism is not necessarily wrong or a bad idea. I'd just have to think about the impact on Delwath. I haven't done the generation math but I assume he would not have experienced a mela yet


[11/3/2023 1:15 PM] rsulfuratus
whether that counts could be clear or unclear depending on how you feel, I guess
he wouldn't have experienced a mela on the material plane. but would have while trapped in the shadow realm


[11/3/2023 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I would expect that elves on the feywild for example would still experience the mela whether they were in the feywild or not


[11/3/2023 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
What about this...

The mela and leya are not time periods or events in the lifecycle of an individual elf, the are actual metaphysical events in the world. Every 80 years, since the first elves were born, Aldanor exhales -- the leya -- and the inhales -- the mela.  (The metaphor is just an example, something plant-related might be better).

An individual elf -- wherever they are -- feels these in their bones. The first leya of an elf's life is said to breath Aldanor's spirit into the elf, and makes them 'adult'. This is often accompanied by an urge to travel or see some new part of the world, and the eighty years after the leya have come to be called by the name of the event.

The first mela, on the other hand, pulls an elf home, and is accompanied by an urge to reconnect with Aldanor. The mela itself lasts for some amount of time - 5 years? 10 years? - as a long inhale basically.

Elves who "reconnect with Aldanor" during that mela become fertile


[11/3/2023 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that a lot


[11/3/2023 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
It could be somewhat unknown what happens to elves who don't return during the mela


[11/3/2023 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
again, the metaphor and vibes might need to be a little different


[11/3/2023 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
And for Delwath specifically, he *didn't* feel the pulse of the mela while in the Shadowfell


[11/3/2023 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Is that because it was too faint, and he was too lost in his pain to notice it and he missed it? Is it because it didn't reach him? In the next mela (when is that, anyway?) will he feel like?


[11/3/2023 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
There is likely also something that could be done with this idea and death, i.e. maybe the pulse of Aldanor gets weaker over time, and elves tend to die off around the mela, as they fail to feel it at all


[11/3/2023 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
Or maybe not


[11/3/2023 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
But a normal elf in the Feywild would obviously feel the mela, so the fact that Delwath didn't hear it would be interesting, but also if the metaphysics were such that he should have heard it, it could be just because he was too wrapped up in his pain to notice


[11/3/2023 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
Or it could be a cool unique feature of the Cha'mutte pocket dimensions. Actually Cha'mutte having a pocket dimension where the embodied gods can't reach would be plauisble


[11/3/2023 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
next mela starts in 1787, so ~40 years


[11/3/2023 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
currently in the 37th leya, which started in 1707


[11/3/2023 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
actually works out to be a convenient time to run games for elf players


[11/3/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/3/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
I also feel like the metaphor should maybe be plant related, or alternatively somehow the mela (or leya) is Aldanor and the other is Elmerca


[11/3/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
I think mela is Aldanor, the leya is Elmerca


[11/3/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
I don't love inhale / exhale as the metaphor. Just was using it as a quick example of what I meant


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
But actually having one for each god works well


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd make the metaphor more root related somehow, like a grounding in the earth


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
then leya is disperal on the wind


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, that's perfect


[11/3/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually really like the idea that with each mela elves feel less and less connected to taelgar - works with the root metaphor too


[11/3/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
This also works with my original elf notes about the "rite of awakening" and the "rite of return"


[11/3/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/3/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
The mela is the rite of awakening, the leya is the rite of return


[11/3/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
I think by your 5th or 6th mela most elves don't feel the pull of taelgar anymore, and in the 6th leya is when lots of elves leave


[11/3/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
some in the 5th, some in the 7th, but the peak of departures is the 6th leya


[11/3/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
basically you have 1 leya as a wanderer, 1 as a nuturer, 1 as a caretaker, 1 as an elder/unifier, 1 as an ancient, and then you go


[11/3/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
puts typical lifespan right aroun 1000 years, but really once you reach elder many are forgetting and starting to turn inward


[11/3/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
and then those who stay do so for a reason


[11/3/2023 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
right that seems perfec


[11/3/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that puts the sort of typical elven memory threshold around 400 years:
- you don't remember much from your first mela
- your first leya (80 years) you are out in the word
- next two ka (320 years) you are alternating between caretarker and nuturer
- then you reach your 5th mela and the pull starts to fade. maybe you become a unifier and turn inward, stick around as an elder, etc, but the past starts to feel more like a dream, etc for most elves

I pushed a note that has all the elven generations going back to the 1st ka with the mela and leya start years fyi, under elves

updated elven generations note with text based on this, feel free to edit


[11/3/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking about this some more, the idea that it is liternally Aldanor's influence that lets elves reproduce puts Cha'mutte's desire to kill all the gods in a different light


[11/3/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
no wonder the elves were so against him


[11/3/2023 3:22 PM] .deciusmus
That actually fits perfectly. He is going to kill the elves as a sacrifice to free the other races


[11/5/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking more about elven society, trying to get a vision of orenlas. here is kind of my framework, but interested in your perspective if anything seems "un-elvish" to you.


[11/5/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
1. synthesizing the email discussion about material abundance, intellectual property, what elves see as wealth, etc. 

the basic framework is that elves are capable, via magic, of growing nearly anything, but this is not necessarily simple or easy in all cases. growing enough food and providing simple clothes, space to live, basic necessities, for all elves is the first priority, and except when under attack or otherwise disrupted from the normal balance of things, this is always possible and a fundamental aspect of elven civilization. there is no poverty in elven cities

that said, this does not mean there are no differences in wealth. while elves find no reason to accumulate coin or gems in their raw form, they do value new things that are brought into the world, whether ideas/songs/stories/poems or physical things of beauty, or of practical value (although I think elven culture would usually tend towards beauty). building on the idea from the sisila tree fruit backstory from Delwath, one thing that determines wealth is that it is a privilege to be allowed to use rare materials. so you can't buy sisila fruit with money, but if you are recognized as a talented chef you are given one to bake with. 

exactly how this kind of resource allocation is managed in elven society can be handwaved a bit, but the key vibes aspect is that there are wealthy/non-wealthy elves in some sense, but wealth is measured in what you create. so a "poor" jeweler may often work with plain metals, and a "rich" jeweler may have the opportunity to craft in mithril. but there is also a "how far have your creations spread" aspect, and this is how you "get rich" - a "poor" jeweler who produces amazing designs in bronze and copper may get asked to make something with gold or mithral. 

this ties in to intellectual property too, as derivative work is less valued that new work


[11/5/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the details of this are a bit unnecessary to really know, but the implications in game would be:
1. elves would sometimes trade for material goods, as material abundance does not necessarily mean lack of scarcity entirely - but they wouldn't *need* to do it
2. you still have a kind of status hierarchy based around perceived value of the new things you bring into the world. as a side note, this sets up a bit of dichotomy where "creators" are higher status than "doers". So Delwath, as a solider and quartermaster, would not necessarily be seen as a high status elf (although perhaps this is also a consequence of the great war - in the absence of war perhaps he would have been an amazing chef). i'm not sure this is exactly right, so maybe there is kind of a second, orthogonal hierarchy that is more oriented around caretaker roles, so you can be high status because you are a skilled commander or a talented wizard and not necessarily need to create something new
3. elven cities would feel weird to other races - there aren't markets in the usual sense, people aren't really buying food. there would be trees with fruit just kind of there, for example. maybe there would be occasional art shows, and lots of songs and storytelling, and things like that that would have subtle undercurrents of competition noticeably primarily to other elves


[11/5/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
2. on governance and society

the basic idea here I think is a bit more established, around the nurturer/caretaker distinction, the unifiers and the "trial of unity" idea, and the idea of each ka as kind of a collective unit that figures out how to reach consensus on their own

the game implications are, I think:
1. you can't go to an elven city and say "take me to your leader" - there is no galadriel or elrond to speak to. however, I think that most elven settlements would have some people who are the outerward face of the community to visitors. perhaps with explicit titles like "Caretaker So-and-So". 
2. if you are asking something of "elves" it should be a little unclear how decisions are made, although there is an opportunity to create a way to participate in a "trial by unity" if desired
3. there should probably not be a lot of internal, obvious factions in elvish society, except during times of debate and consensus-finding, and then those factions would be temporary. this is probably not a universal rule - decision points have to start somewhere and may start with a factional period. but once it is resolved, it is resolved.


[11/5/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
adding this to worldbuilding/brainstorming as well


[11/5/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
I like all this


[11/5/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
A few other thoughts ‚Äî I think a lot of this ‚Äî especially the creator stuff ‚Äî would move on scales that make it hard for humans to observe. There is probably rarely a rush and a lot of time spent contemplating and so on


[11/5/2023 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
So for example an elven poetry recital might seem odd to a human in a couple of ways‚Äî it might take a couple of days rather than a night, and reactions might be considered and take a week or two or more to come out


[11/5/2023 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure.. thinking a bit


[11/5/2023 6:59 PM] .deciusmus
So‚Ä¶ forget the above. I think it isn‚Äôt interesting. I think you have it about right, but I‚Äôd make one tweak.


[11/5/2023 7:08 PM] .deciusmus
Basically here‚Äôs my view of the PCs arriving in an elf city and attending a banquet.  

Unlike in a human city, where the banquet would be put on by some lord/baron/whatever, in the elven city it is probably put on by someone the community values highly. A creator of some sort. 

Maybe in this case a famous chef is throwing a banquet to celebrate a rare nectar that is aged for 3 ka and is being unveiled. 

Who attends? It isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúrich‚Äù as that isn‚Äôt entirely meaningful. Perhaps the chef invites a poet, who has agreed to present a new poem in the chef‚Äôs honor. A jewel smith is also in attendance in exchange for a delicate ring, which is presented as a gift to the chef before the meal (so everyone can admire the jewel smith). Of course some of the chefs friends are there as well, perhaps without any particular gifts.


[11/5/2023 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
But I‚Äôm not sure it would feel like a status competition exactly


[11/5/2023 7:10 PM] .deciusmus
How did the chef get the rare nectar to begin with? Probably via a consensus process more than anything else. The rare materials go to those who can make the best use of them


[11/5/2023 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
Or rather can create the best thing with them


[11/5/2023 7:12 PM] .deciusmus
And of course, plenty of elves are ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt have any great talents - and would rarely if ever attend such fancy banquets


[11/5/2023 7:14 PM] .deciusmus
But I think an outsider would see it all as glittering and amazing and impressive - an ‚Äúfancy‚Äù elven banquet would be filled with the best creators


[11/5/2023 7:21 PM] .deciusmus
As far as status, it‚Äôs perfectly normal for government agents or even generals to be middling rather than high status‚Ä¶ and given there is no low status or poverty why would a commander necessarily be high status?


[11/5/2023 7:22 PM] .deciusmus
Now, gratitude is a real thing and a famous solider who was known to say have saved a bunch of elves would certainly have an ‚Äúin‚Äù


[11/5/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
right, this is what I was getting at with "orthogonal hierarchy"


[11/5/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't the same as being rich, in a sense, but there are many ways to being respected


[11/5/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I just don‚Äôt think elven society is particularly status conscious


[11/5/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
true


[11/5/2023 7:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but in your banquet example, perhaps the famous solider is also there - not because they are necessarily friends with the chef, or have anything valuable to present to demonstrate their creative prowess, but simply as a gesture of gratitude and acknowledgement


[11/5/2023 7:26 PM] .deciusmus
I do think there are glittering banquets and famous painters who having a portrait from them is something a bunch of elves want. But then other elves maybe are more interested in listening to Aldanors roots and spend years ‚Äúnot doing much‚Äù as far as humans would see it


[11/5/2023 7:26 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense


[11/5/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
I do think the more material focused elves who be the ones ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù see more. It‚Äôs easier to observe the unveiling of a famous painting or a jeweler presenting an orate set of earrings


[11/5/2023 7:27 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/5/2023 7:30 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway I think your vibe is basically right, the main comment I really had is that I‚Äôm not sure elves are particularly obsessed with status. So I think the poetry reading would be more about being good and honoring the material and bringing something new into the world, and less about one-upping another elf


[11/5/2023 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that makes sens


[11/5/2023 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
*sense


[11/5/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
Of course if a famous goldsmith was in attendance and one of the poets particularly wanted a new set of golden candlesticks, then the poet might be trying to impress the goldsmith


[11/5/2023 7:32 PM] .deciusmus
And an aspiring goldsmith needs to impress the community to be seen as ‚Äúworthy‚Äù of working in a scare resource (gold)


[11/5/2023 7:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess one thing to think about is who is collecting all this art - some of it is maybe made for the artist, or for the community, but is any art collected? is it only by other artists?


[11/5/2023 7:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess this is in part what I was thinking about w/r/t other hierarchies of status - does a famous diplomat or solider or other kind of hero/adventurer come home and end up with wealth in the form of gifts?


[11/5/2023 7:36 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, probably.


[11/5/2023 7:37 PM] .deciusmus
And I think even a ‚Äúmiddle-class‚Äù elf would have some art. After all, to gain a name for yourself you‚Äôd want to give away some works


[11/5/2023 7:40 PM] .deciusmus
And also, beauty is I think important to elven culture


[11/5/2023 7:41 PM] .deciusmus
But also it isn‚Äôt obvious they would want it. Maybe gardens are their thing not art. Or song, and they are honored by having some songs dedicated to them

sure, of course


[11/5/2023 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
on a separate topic, looking at the timing of leya and mela, I think it probably needs to be the case that these aren


[11/5/2023 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
*aren't hard and fast dates, but rather have some flexibility


[11/5/2023 7:43 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., right now the leya of the 36th ka starts in 1547, two years after the great war begins


[11/5/2023 7:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but it makes a lot more sense for that generation to have been "rushed" and underwent the Rite of Awakened 10 years early


[11/5/2023 7:44 PM] .deciusmus
Right, well, ultimately it‚Äôs literally something Aldanor and Elmerca are doing


[11/5/2023 7:45 PM] .deciusmus
So they could have changed the timing


[11/5/2023 7:47 PM] .deciusmus
But I don‚Äôt think elves themselves can change it. Although I think the leya isn‚Äôt actually physiologically as important as the mela.


[11/5/2023 7:47 PM] rsulfuratus
the way I've been thinking about it in sketching out history is the following:
1. the mela starts every 160 years, like clockwork. the rooting of aldanor grows stronger in the few years before the mela begins, and by the beginning of the mela elves are feeling the pull of Aldanor's roots and their connection to Taelgar. sometimes this lasts 10 years, sometimes 20.
2. elven childhood, the time of dreaming, is usually 50 years, but sometimes it is 35, and sometimes 60. the leya is traditionally marked as when the first elven children begin to experience the Rite of Awakening
3. the first few years of the leya often have a gradual pace of awakening, but sometimes everyone awakens all at once. Elmerca, who controls prophecy and foresight, also controls the timing of the leya and can shift the dreams of the sleepers as needed


[11/5/2023 7:48 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I like that


[11/5/2023 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
the advantage of this is for worldbuilding is that we don't have to constantly adjust the dates of each ka, which are counted from the start of the mela, but have flexibilty for the role of the elves in the world by shifting the leya


[11/5/2023 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
so the leya dates in the cycle of generations doc could be shifted by 15 years or so in either direction, but the mela dates shouldn't change


[11/5/2023 7:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right. That makes sense. I also think each individual elf has a different length of time in the dreaming. Because kids are born over say a 15-20 year span, but the awakening is more of a 2-3 year span


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
The older kids just spend longer in the dreaming.


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
Elves probably find the idea of counting age a bit odd anyway. It would be meaningless to Delwath to say he is 263 years old or whatever.


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
(Which I think kind fits how I‚Äôve been playing him anyway)


[11/5/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
putting aside strangeness with the shadow realm, I think delwath would say he is in his 2nd leya


[11/5/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
if anyone pressed him on his age


[11/5/2023 7:52 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, or he‚Äôd translate from human years from the start of the ka in which he was born


[11/5/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/5/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
(which is 1467 - for the 36th ka. but I just changed the start of the 36th leya to 1532)


[11/5/2023 7:53 PM] .deciusmus
But actually Delwath never experienced a mela. This return to Orenlas would be his first time returning to an elven place since he left for war in the 1532


[11/5/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[2/1/2024 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
on elves - I think my vision is that this isn't a longing for something else, or a weariness of the world, but more of just a feeling that this time is complete. it would be like a sense of "doneness" more than anything else.


[2/1/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[11/19/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
do you have any ideas about what the divine realm of Aldanor might be like? i thought we had some brief discussions about this at some point but can't find them now


[11/19/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
oh, wait, found this email

The domain of Aldanor and Elmerca is at first glance, an ancient forest at twilight, with bright stars twinkling above and secluded pools of still water reflecting the sky. But all is not as it seems. The forest is not a traditional forest, where the trees grow straight up from the ground, and where water flows downhill, and where the sky is always above. Instead, it is more a set of forest vignettes, connected by pathways of thought, dream, and magic. A visitor might arrive in a small glade, with ancient trees towering overhead and silver flowers blooming in the moonlight on the forest floor. But walking out of the glade, they might find themselves standing on criss-crossed branches hundreds of feet across, part of the canopy of an unimaginably large tree, looking down at a river of bright stars sparkling like a field of diamonds. Walking around a branch, the visitor might find it narrowing, and narrowing, until they find themselves in the leaves of an ancient oak grove, surrounded by cliffs that go up forever, but growing out of nothing but a field of stars below. Climbing to the base of one of the oaks, the visitor might notice the field of stars becomes, as they pass the edge of the grove,  swaying bridge of twisted vines and moss and delicate orchids with hundreds of complex petals, leading over a gorge between two huge cliffs, with a misty bottom a thousand feet below, and trees growing up out of the bottom of the gorge and stretching into the sky full of stars.

Navigation is a challenge, as the place is partly memory and dream, and so navigation is not really by sight or touch, but by memory and recollection. Some pathways are lit up with magical beacons, and those with eyes to see the magic and the right memories can navigate more easily, although only between some of the major landmarks: the Cascade of Living Stars, the Wind Scar, the First Wilds, the Canopy of the Eldest, others unnamable and unreported. [No specific ideas on what these places are, just tossing out names]

The plane is permeated deeply by a sense of age and ancientness -- there are no new growths, no saplings, no green shoots or new plants. Even the blooming flowers, mosses, vines and other small plants are permeated with a sense of age. There are exceptions though: the first is the stars - they often appear bright-new as if they were created moments ago. These stars often appear as if they are just within arms reach, although rarely does one who reaches for them find they really are within arms reach. It is said that the stars are the thoughts of Elmerca, and each continues a true foretelling of some future event. But it is also said that they are dangerous, and burn with a fierce cold and razor-sharp edges. The other exception is magic: out of the ancient trees magical creations regularly 'bloom'. This magic usually upsets the normal order of time: ephemeral things in the material plane are long-lived, and permanent things ephemeral: sparkling fireworks that last for days, or years; small wisps of energy shaped like squirrels, or birds, that dash across the woods and vanish into a tree the next moment; embodied notes of songs, that drift through the realm with a soft hint of music, and gather in flocks where the soft hints crescendo into orchestral triumphs; silver-flecked granite boulders, that last just long enough to serve as a stepping stone over a stream, and then scattering into a flurry of glittering silver; salty raindrops, like tears, the slowly drift down (or up) from the sky carrying pervasive sense of melancholy.


[11/19/2024 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
In general I like that. One thought is is there 1 domain or 2? do the various elder races typically have a single divine realm?


[11/19/2024 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
Also I wonder if there should be some type of sense of connection to the mela / leya connection. Is there a tide or sense in Aldanor's realm of the mela/leya? Does it originate there somehow?
