Notes

Years are indicated in Dwarven, which starts counted at the beginning of time. 

The most common human counting of years, the Drankorian Reckoning, starts from the founding of Drankor in 4134.

The current year in Taelgar is 5881, or 1748 DR. 

To convert, subtract 4133 from the Dwarven year to get the Drankorian year, or add 4133 to the Drankorian year to get the Dwarven year.

  

Regions of the world are roughly:

Taelgar -- anything affecting the whole world or otherwise not appropriately placed in a single region

West Coast -- the western coast, from the current-day Chardon/Dunmar border at the Myraeni Gap, north to the arctic, on the west side of the mountains

Central Coast -- Dunmar, east to the desert, and north to the Plaguelands, roughly, but excluding the immediate Green Sea coast

Western Green Sea -- Greater Sembara, plus Cymea and Skaegenland

Eastern Green Sea -- the Green Sea east of Sembara

The South -- the great eastern desert and everything south or east of it.

The Far North -- The Kenku plains, and everything north and east of them.
