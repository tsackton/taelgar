This page has various notes about northern migrations and related religious traditions that may or may not be canonical, copied largely from old Google Docs.


Notes on rough history of the west:

- First settlers slowly move north through the forests and empty landscapes, encountering Elder races, fey, and other magic. Largely settle along coast, through to the Great Bay in the north.
    
- The ones who settle on islands west of Chardon maintain ocean-going connections to Hkar, albeit loose ones
    
- Eventually, in the north, the northlanders encounter dwarves and cross the mountains, settling the Sembaran highlands and Vostok, later to form the Sembaran highland culture and the Kestavo religion
    
- At the time of the fall of Hkar, there are thus three distinct cultural and religious groups:

- The west islanders, off the coast
    
- The coastal northlanders, generally north of Chardon and up through the great bay area and northn (ancestors of the Mawar people)
    
- The inland northerners, on both sides of the mountains, although the upheavals of the fall of Hkar have cut off these cultures so they begin to develop independently from here
    

- During the time of Drankor:
    

- The west islanders resist Drankorian advances and remain independent
    
- The coastal people are conquered and pushed north / out to sea, settling the Mawar peninsula and the area north of Mawar, along the coast of the ~Great Bay~
    
- The inland northerners on the west (Deno’qai) are pushed further north and further inland, towards what will become Pandar, but also with many of them living on the margins of Elven kingdoms. 
    
- The inland northerners on the east develop into the Sembaran highland culture
    
- Much of the land that now makes up the Chardonian Empire falls under the influence, although generally not direct rule, of Drankor, and adopts the Mos Numera tradition, influenced by the Northlander traditions
    
- An explicit campaign by the Drankorians to eliminate false gods drives many of the small gods of the Northlanders extinct
    

- Then, over the course of the rest of the Fourth Age:
    

- Cha’mutte’s base in Pandar ends up enslaving many of the inland northerners who remain, as most of the far north falls under the influence of his hobgoblin armies
    
- The growing patchwork of small kingdoms north of Chardon draw largely on Drankorian cultural history, and many fall under the indirect cultural sway of Chardon itself, but many coastal northerlander communities become incorporated into these kingdoms and assimilated
    
- The west islands remain distinct, continuing on their trajectory
    
- The people of the Far North, north of Pandar, develop into an isolated community with a distinct religious tradition
    

- During the Blood Years, upheavals again with the death of millions in war and the northward expansion of the Chardonian empire. 
    

  

At the current time (1748 DR), the north looks like this:

- The west islanders remain a distinct, proud community with their own religious tradition that has developed free of much outside influence since before the fall of Hkar
    
- The Far North remains a distinct, isolated community, with ancient ties to the coastal and inland northerners but with a very different experience of the rise and fall of Cha’mutte
    
- The coastal northlander culture, which spreads north along the coast is recovering and has a religious tradition that is heavily influenced by Mos Numera but retains elements of the traditional folk religions – the old traditions are more like saints and they have a culture with a lot of demigods added to the Mos Numera pantheon, often with an element of ancestor worship, where the heroes of the past become saints and then intercede with the Eight Divines. Most of the refugees who survived the hobgoblin wars fled to the coast and there are now 3-4 kingdoms with uneasy relationships with Chardon here (e.g. Mawar Confederacy)
    
- An inland northerner culture (the Deno’qai), made up of people who fled or hid from Cha’mutte, or escaped enslavement during the Blood Years, and largely hid from hobgoblins; have a distinctive religious tradition related to the Kestavo that they kept alive and hidden for many generations; these people are the closest culturally to the Sembaran highland people, albeit separated by difficult travel across the mountains for much of the post-Hkar period. 
    

  

So, major religious traditions in the northlands:

  

1. Northlander Mos Numera: the dominant northlander culture, what was once the blended culture of the northern kingdoms and the coast, has a tradition based on Mos Numena but with a lot of extra demigods. This would share some similarities with real-world Latin America, but maybe with a bit of norse/Greek heroes flavor to the demigods.

  

2. The inland northerner culture has a distinct religious tradition that is related to the Kestavo. These people are now scattered across the inland areas of the north beyond Chardon, with few cities and low density. In many ways this tradition (tentatively Tanshi) and the Kestavo are quite similar and might share names and ideas of what the ‘[[High Gods]]’ are, e.g. Arha and Malik and perhaps other “primordial” gods. However, the tanshi are not tied to place - they are spirits summoned by sacrifice. 

  

3. The western islanders have another distinct tradition that is, I think, based on ancestor worship and ancestors as intercessory agents with Arha and Malik

  

4. The Far North people may have yet another tradition, or they may have a religion that is in line with Kestavo / Deno’qai / Tanshi / inland northerner tradition




## Northlander Mos Numera

My current idea is that one strand of northern folk religions had already started developing towards a pantheonic tradition, basically growing out of a tradition where the small gods became less tied to a specific place and thus some could get powerful. Then, when the Drankorians came, the northerners merged their gods, but kept some traditions (perhaps sacrifice, which isn’t really part of Drankorian traditions; perhaps more personal names for the gods; perhaps a richer, more chaotic set of demigods and heroes). The metaphysical effects of this are unclear -- did the old gods cease to exist, did they somehow merge with the Eight Divines? 

  

In any case, most of the settled area around the “Great Bay” now acknowledges some form of Mos Numera, but with a distinctive twist of a substantially larger and more personalized pantheon. This would be the place to flesh out a kind of a more Norse or Greek style of divinity, which currently doesn’t really have a home in Taelgar. But crucially these demigods and heroes would have limited real power because they would have few worshippers. The metaphysics could get interesting - maybe they don’t have enough power to have their own Spiritual Realm, and the heroes and villains and demigods of good and evil in this tradition inhabit the primordial planes? Maybe some live on the edges of the Realm of the Eight Divines?

## Ancestor Gods Tradition

The islands to the west of Chardon, which have been isolated and distinct since before the fall of Hkar, have yet another tradition. Still an intercessory one, but instead of being focused on the small gods of the land, this is focused on ancestor worship, and the power of ancestors to intercede with the divine. 

  

I think there would be a few implications:

- The afterlife may have a much greater importance than in many other Taelgarian religions, and perhaps resurrection magic is either particularly common or specifically taboo. 
    
- Do ancestor spirits have the capacity to become divine themselves? Obviously canonically humans can become divine in some way after death (Beryl, Bhishma), but so far this is more an honor granted those of particular worth and heroism, not something that happens when enough prayer accretes to your spirit. But of course this could change and maybe generations of prayers to a particular ancestor has made that ancestor into a demigod of sorts.**
