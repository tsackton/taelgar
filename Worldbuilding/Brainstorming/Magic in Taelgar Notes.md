Starting a brainstorming doc to codify some notes on magic in Taelgar. 
## A Few Basic Truths

Starting with a few basic observations about the world that should be maintained. 

1. Most magic comes from the various gods and divinities of Taelgar. This is by far the easiest magic to learn, the most common magic, and the most reliable magic. 
	1. For humans, this means that divine magic users are far more common than arcane or primal magic users among the population
	2. For Firstborn races, this means that whatever manifestations of magic that their Embodied Gods provide are far more common than anything else.
2. Arcane magic comes from learning to manipulate extraplanar energy, which leaks into Taelgar as an aftereffect of the Riving. This has relatively little implications for spellcasting, but is an important lore fact.
3. Primal magic comes from the resonances among the echo realms in the world of Taelgar. What exactly this means is not clearly defined in world lore yet, but the vague implication is that it somehow the magic of the material plane. 
4. The ability to use magic is much more common, for whatever reason, among individuals driven to adventure, as heroes or villains, than among those who settle. This does not currently have any satisfying in-game explanation, but is necessary to allow satisfying high-level adventures to exist with humanoid allies and enemies.
## How Common is Magic?

Considering general spellcasting ability, common magic items, rare magic items, and high level spells separately. 

### General Spellcasting Ability

A good rule of thumb is that roughly 1 in 1000 people has some kind of magical talent. This suggests that generally a spellcaster is available in most larger market towns, but only 1 in 10 or even 1 in 20 small villages will have a spellcaster. Most people will probably know a spellcaster second or third-hand; almost everyone would at least know someone who has seen magic performed. 

In standard human populations, a safe assumption would be that 50%-60% of spellcasters are divine magic users, mostly clerics, although there is presumably some regional variation, and arcane spellcasters in particular may be likely to aggregate in much higher density around major centers of learning. Non-divine spellcasters are likely roughly equally divided between primal and arcane casters. 

In a typical heavily settled agricultural region with about 10,000 people scattered between a market town and numerous small villages, one might expect to find 5-6 divine magic users (mostly/entirely clerics), 2-3 arcane magic users (mostly wizards or bards), and 2-3 primal magic users (druids or rangers).

### Spell Levels

Among the magic-using, non-adventuring population, only about 20%-30% of spellcasters ever learn, or are even capable of learning, to cast anything more powerful than a 1st level spell, and generally less than 5% of non-adventuring spellcasters ever achieve the power to cast 3rd level or higher spells. 

This implies that even in a large city of 100,000 people, there are probably only 4-6 people who can cast 3rd level spells or higher, and it is likely that 2-3 of them are clerics. 

Magic higher than 3rd level would be exceptionally rare and require a special effort to track down. 

The general implications are probably as follows:
#### Clerics

1. The spells that have the greatest effect on worldbuilding are cleric cantrips, and to a lesser extent 1st level cleric spells. Considering only non-damage, non-combat spells, and picking a few key ones...
	1. Guidance: while this does not have a major effect on worldbuilding, it can be used to flavor effective prayers being fairly common
	2. Light: with only an hour duration, doesn't really substitute for electricity or oil lamps, but probably should consider things like the priest of a market town spending 10 minutes walking the public square and lighting it up for an hour past dark
	3. Mending: the biggest impact on worldbuilding. if mending is generally available in most market towns, things last longer in general, and temples/religions could use as a source of funds e.g, a market stall to fix things in exchange for a small donation
	4. Create or Destroy Water: this would be very effective for firefighting, and might help explain why towns don't burn down as frequently as they did historically; but it doesn't create enough water to sustain a population in the absence of a non-magical water source, or prevent a drought from destroying crops
	5. Cure Wounds, Healing Word: in my opinion, the major worldbuilding implication here is we can assume childbirth is very safe, or at least if there are complications as long as you get a cleric you can save the child or the mother or both fairly easily. this can also be used for things like setting broken bones, healing damage from minor injuries, etc. generally use the ready availablity of cure wounds as a substitute for modern medicine to give the world a more more demographic flavor (childbirth is not super-dangerous, child mortality is not super high)
	6. Purify Food and Drink, Detect Poison and Disease: major use would be stopping water-borne disease. the cleric blesses the well and people stop getting sick; Detect Poison and Disease can trace the source of outbreaks. 
2. At 2nd level, you get a few addiitonal worldbuilding implications, primarily for large cities where 2nd level casters are more common
	1. Augury: mostly for flavor, but people asking the local priest for advice would not be too atypical; only works 1/day per cleric though
	2. Continual Flame: despite the costly material components, would be extremely valuable for producing lanterns in big cities, and in many cases streets should be lit at night not by oil lamps but by continual flame lamps (however, theft might be a problem). Permanent lanterns would be a thing but an expensive, luxury item.
	3. Enhance Ability, Locate Object: mostly flavor, really, but you would have prayers of finding and other kinds of prayers 
	4. Lesser Restoration: major impact on disease; although you can only cure a few people per day, and so can't stop a massive outbreak, this can make disease burden much closer to modern day than to typical medieval conditions
	5. Zone of Truth: in some places, this may be common enough to be part of criminal proceedings, especially in places like Dunmar where priests are judges
3. At 3rd level, spells start to really scale in power, with things like Sending, Speak with Dead, Create Food and Water, Clairvoyance, Tongues having potentially major impacts on the world. But in general, these are rare enough that while accessible they aren't common enough to majorly affect worldbuliding - these are just there for things like the population of city X survived a siege longer than expected by supplementing their supplies with Create Food and Water, etc.

# Player’s Overview of Magic

## Overview

Taelgar is a world rich in magic. While it comes in many flavors, fundamentally all magic in Taelgar arises from extra-planar energy flowing into Taelgar. However, within this broad definition, many flavors of magic exist. 

### Racial Magic

The Elder races have their own racial magics that draw power from their connections to the Embodied Gods that created them. While the exact nature of these racial magics is not always widely known, rumors abound of elves manipulating the essence of magic itself, of dwarves and their runes of power, of lizardfolk and their connection to the Dreamworld and the spirits of their ancestors, of halfling telepathy, of stoneborn able to change their bodies and strengthen there minds. 

  

The other races, such as the Children of Ahra and Malik, the descendants of the elder elementals, the titans, the great wyrms, and the archfey, have their own kinds of racial magic, although these are little understood by human scholars.

### Divine Magic

The gods -- whether the embodied gods, or the incorporeal gods of humanity -- are able to grant miracles, to manifest the magic of the Divine in the world of Taelgar, through the prayers of their followers. This is the magic of clerics and paladins. 

### Primal Magic

The echo realms, the parts of the multiverse created when the Age of Creation ended and some of the strength of magic was drawn out of the material plane, still resonate deeply with the material plane itself. Some magic users learn to draw energy from these resonances. This is the magic of druids and rangers, who draw on the magical resonances within the natural world itself.

### Arcane Magic

Other magic users draw energy from the wild chaos of the Plane of Magic itself, which intersects with Taelgar at connections known as ley lines. This arcane magic can be learned, via study and practice; this is the magic of wizards and many bards. Or, it can be innate, as is the case for some sorcerers.

### Other Magic

Rumors abound of magical energy drawn from the Plane of Consciousness, sometimes called the Plane of Souls, power that can be used to manipulate the world with mental force alone. The ki of monks, for example, represents this kind of power. 

  

Other magic users exist as well, such as warlocks, those who have made pacts with powerful entities and thus can channel the power of these powerful entities. Ultimately, all magic is just the application of extraplanar energy. So anything that can channel extraplanar energy can create magic. 

# DM Guide

## Modification of Magic

Magic in Taelgar can be made stronger, or weaker, by many things. Often, these are aspects of the world that lead to weaker, or stronger, connections between the other planes and the material planes. Other times, these may be ancient relics or pieces of the world still holding on to the energies of creation.

### Ley Lines

Because magic derives from the channeling of extraplanar energy, it can be affected by places and objects that bring the other planes in closer alignment with the realm of Taelgar. The Plane of Magic is the ultimate source of the arcane magic of wizards, bards, artificers, eldritch knights, arcane tricksters, and some warlocks and sorcerers, and the energy of the Plane of Magic spills over into the world of Taelgar in the form of ley lines, and in particular nodes, where ley lines cross.

#### Ley Line Mechanics

Any arcane caster can attempt to sense ley lines, although the subtle signs can be hard to detect. To sense ley lines, an arcane caster can concentrate for 10 minutes, focusing their awareness on the flow of magic around them. In a hurry, the caster can instead attempt to perceive ley lines as an action, which requires a spellcasting ability check against a DC set by the DM depending on the power, distance, and nature of nearby ley lines. At the DM's discretion, and depending on the circumstances, casters proficient in Arcana, Perception, or another relevant skill may add their proficiency bonus to this check. 

Although ley lines themselves do little more than feed the ambient energy that powers arcane magic, nodes can be sources of extra magical power. Any arcane caster can attempt to draw energy from a node, but this process is risky for those who haven't studied and trained in the methods of using ley lines represented mechanically by the Ley Initiate feat

To draw energy from a node, a caster must make a spellcasting ability check with a DC equal to 11 + level of the spell being cast. The result, depending on the check:

Fail by 4 or more: suffer backlash

Fail by less than 4: spell cast as normal

Succeed: gain bonus depending on node strength

Backlashes may include effects such as releasing a ley spirit of magical energy, which may be hostile, the spell producing only a harmless display of bright noise, temporarily incapacitating the caster, damage to the caster, or draining some of the caster's magical energy. 

Bonuses may include effects that empower your spell, such as increasing the level at which your spell was cast, increasing the duration, adding additional damage or minor conditions, or making it easier to maintain. Effects may also boost the caster, including gaining temporary hit points, arcane shields, and even restoring magical energy. The strength of the boost is dependent on the power of the node. 

A Note on Warlocks and Sorcerers

Warlocks and sorcerers draw their power from a variety of sources. While in some cases, these casters create magical effects via shaping the energy of the Plane of Magic, this is not always so. A shadow sorcerer or hexblade warlock, for example, may be more likely to rely on the inherent magic of the echo realms, in particular Shadowfell. Thus, the magic of these classes may be arcane / Plane of Magic, or more related to the divine or primal magic of other casters, depending on the source of their power. 

##### Sample Ley Line Tables

  

Backlash Table 

Roll on this table to determine the effect of a backlash. Unless otherwise noted, the spell you cast takes effect as normal.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1|The backlash overwhelms your mind. You act as if under the effects of the Confusion spell for the next minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 11 + level of the spell that triggered the backlash. On a success, the confusion effect ends.|
|2|Magical energies overwhelm you, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn.|
|3|The energy of the spell is misdirected. If the spell involves attack rolls, they are made with disadvantage; if the spell involves saving throws, they are made with advantage. If the spell involves neither, roll again on this table ignoring this effect.|
|4|Magical static interferes with your spellcasting. For the next hour, any time you attempt to cast a spell, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted.|
|5|The energies of the Plane of Magic strike against you. You take 2d6 force damage per level of the spell that caused the backlash, or 1d6 force damage if the spell was a cantrip.|
|6|The ley line consumes some of your magical energy. You lose one spell slot, which is the highest level you have available but not higher than 5th level, or the level of the spell that was cast plus 1, whichever is lower.|
|7|The backlash interferes with your magical items. All charged items in your possession lose 1d4 charges.|
|8|The ley line energies distorts your casting. The spell you intended to cast fails. Instead, you produce an effect from the wand of wonder or the wild magic surge tables, at the discretion of the DM.|
|9|The energy of the ley line overwhelms your casting, and the spell produces only a harmless display of bright color and loud noise.|
|10|A ley elemental spirit emerges from the node. This creature is chaotic and uncontrolled, and generally hostile to any arcane spellcaster.|

Minor Node Table

Roll on this table to increase the power of a spell when you tap a minor node while casting. If the effect rolled would have no effect, you may choose to reroll on this table, or select effect #1.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1|The ley energies give you a protection. You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.|
|2|The ley line bolsters the energy of the spell. Treat it as cast with a spell slot one level higher than you used.|
|3|The magical energies of the ley line heal you. You regain hit points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.|
|4|Magical energies shield you temporarily. You gain +2 to AC until the start of your next turn.|
|5|If your spell involves rolling dice, you may reroll a number up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).|
|6|If your spell deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can change the damage to one of the other listed types.|
|7|If the spell you cast involves one or more attack rolls, one attack roll of your choice is made with advantage.|
|8|If your spell affects multiple creatures, and forces them to make a saving throw, you may choose one target, who must make the saving throw with disadvantage.|
|9|If your spell does damage to a target, all creatures damaged by your spell must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or and knocked prone.|
|10|You regain one 1st level spell slot.|

Major Node Table

Roll on this table to increase the power of a spell when you tap a major node while casting. If the effect rolled would have no effect, you may choose to reroll on this table, or select effect #1.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1|The ley energies give you a protection. You gain temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier + twice the level of spell cast.|
|2|The ley line bolsters the energy of the spell. Treat it as cast with a spell slot two levels higher than you used.|
|3|The magical energies of the ley line heal you. You regain 1d4 hit points per level of the spell you cast, plus your spellcasting ability modifier.|
|4|Magical energies shield you temporarily. You gain +5 to AC until the end of your next turn.|
|5|If your spell involves rolling dice, you may choose up to two die rolls and replace them with the maximum value of the die.|
|6|If your spell deals damage, it ignores resistance, and creatures that are immune take half damage instead of no damage.|
|7|Magical energies swirl around you. You gain inspiration, which can be used to get advantage on one roll of your choice. This inspiration is lost once you use it, and otherwise lasts until you complete a long rest.|
|8|If your spell forces one or more targets to make a saving throw, that saving throw is made with disadvantage.|
|9|If your spell does damage to one or more target, all creatures damaged by your spell must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you, and knocked prone. Its speed is also reduced to 0 for the next minute. At the start of each of its turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw (against your spell save DC), ending the effect on success.|
|10|You regain one spell slot of your choice, which cannot be higher than level 3 or the level of the spell that was cast, whichever is lower.|

  

### Primal Presence

The magical resonances of the echo realms and their reflections in Taelgar is the ultimate source of magical power for druids, rangers, and some warlocks and sorcerers. These casters draw on the energy of the world itself, the magic that is reflected from Taelgar into the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the other echo realms. 

Like ley lines, there are thin spots in the world where one or more echo realms are closer to Taelgar, where the boundary between places is more tenuous. These often function as portals between worlds, but can also affect magic that draws power from the echo realms in ways that are similar, albeit more unpredictable, to the way that ley lines affect the magic of the Plane of Magic.

### Chalyte

- Magical gemstone, possibly relic of Age of Creation, and/or formed from ore and other geological processes that interact with ley lines
    
- Can fuel spell effects, particularly arcane magic, and power magic items
    
- Addictive to use and chalyte users often come to slowly rely on it
    
- If used frequently can cause long term problems
    
- Often used to power and charge magic items as a safer alternative
    

## Racial Magic 

The Elder races have unique access to special racial magic, via their connections to the Embodied Gods that created them. 

  

- Elves -> 'true magic', everyday cantrips + powerful rituals
    
- Stoneborn -> modify self
    
- Lizardfolk -> commune with spirits, prophecy
    
- Dwarves -> rune magic
    
- Halflings -> telepathy
