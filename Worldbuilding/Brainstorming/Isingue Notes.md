I think that is pretty much my view as well, with one wrinkle. In my Ausson's Crossing mini-series especially, and less so in my current game, the Isingue community in Maseau and other points to the south is pretty divided between a more patriotic/separatist strain interested in "rebuilding the lost Isingue" and a more assimiliatist strain that may keep some traditions alive but is happy intermarrying and moving on. I suspect that by 1748 a lot of the most separatist types would have emigrated to the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez which is in part an explicitly Isinguese(?) project (although only in part).

I think of Isingue as having a bit of a Zionist strain but also being fundamentally less different than their surroundings than Jews, so there is less motivation for the Zionist tendency, which makes assimilation a lot less fraught.  
  
So I could imagine a few different types.... 

(a) Someone who traces their ancestry back to Isingue but thinks of themselves as Tollender first and foremost. Perhaps the child of a (b) and a Tollender, they still eat Isingue food when visiting the family farm but don't stay in touch with the Isingue community at large. 

(b) Someone who traces their ancestry back to Isingue and still celebrates some unique feasts or makes some special Isingue food or drink or style of decoration or dress, but who is functionality assimilated. This could be similar to say, your relationship to Judaism.

(c) Someone who is active in the Insingue diaspora and perhaps sends money back to Aurbez sometimes, and who attends the special holiday pretty regularly, but they are not exactly motivated to move. They might prefer their children marry an Isinguese but it isn't like they are going to prevent intermarriage. This might be like a fairly typical Reform Jew.

(d) A true believer, who has moved back to Aurbez or is considering it, or is very active part of the diaspora and does a lot to keep it alive. 

I'd guess that (a) and (b) types are by far the most common, especially as Aurbez has become a more reasonable place to emigrate to, and that the (c)s and (d)s are kinda dying out (outside of Aurbez/Maseau).

Yeah, this makes sense. 

My take is the Isingue community in Tollen would be strongly dominated by the assimilationist strain, perhaps even thinking of themselves as some kind of "Isingue-Tollender" blend ala Irish-Americans, with distinct traditions that have grown up specifically in the diaspora (e.g., St. Patrick's Day parades and the like which my understanding is historically were mostly an Irish diaspora thing), and little/no interest in the idea of rebuilding Isingue. 

Which is not to say if the Plaguelands were magically made safe some of these people wouldn't move back south, but it isn't really on their radar. 

I think it might also be the case that Ininguese settlement is pretty low across a lot of Sembara, where refugees probably assimilated quickly and no longer really think of themselves as Isinguese in any meaningful way. 

So you have Isingue refugee communities that still have a distinct identity largely in the south (Aurbez and across the southern edge of Sembara), and in Tollen (and perhaps elsewhere in Cymea or "South Cymea" or wherever else it makes sense for them to pop up later), but not really in Sembara proper.

=====

Yeah that makes sense. Maseau I have established as a place with a significant population of Isinguese refugees but I like Sembara itself being strongly assimilationist.
