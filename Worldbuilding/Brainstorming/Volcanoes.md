some brainstorming on locations of volcanoes:

Canon:
- Pandar, obviously
- A line from [[Svinjo Mountains]], through [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]], and the [[Irrla]]. [[Antaka]] is main named volcano in Skaer area
- Isolated in western Ursk

Maybe/tentative ideas:
- in Zimka, the mountains off the sentinels that are the notheast "border" with Vostok
- Vostok central mountains
- western border of Orekatu in the southeast, running N/S roughly
- islands north/northwest of Mawar
- south nevos sea - potential volcanic island chains
