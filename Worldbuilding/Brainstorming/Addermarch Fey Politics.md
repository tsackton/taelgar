This is a brainstorming note capturing the dynamics of the area of minor lords and potential conflicts between [[Lord Umbraeth]] and[[Archfey Ethlenn]], largely in the area of the [[Feywild]] congruent with [[Addermarch]], the western part of the [[Mostreve Hills]], and the [[Aure]] and [[Enst]] river valleys. 

The rough dynamic of this place is unsettled. In the Feywild, the Sunset Gate provides a strong eastern border, which is only breached (occasionally) by the darkness from [[Darkfall]]. In the west, [[Duskmire]] has spread, first by enroaching on territory of minor fey lords once under the protection of [[Cloudspinner]] and [[Amberglow]]; then spreading north into the area disrupted by the [[Great War]] and the creation of [[Sharpspire]] (congruent with the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] around [[Urlich Pass]]). The area around [[Cleenseau]] and the [[Aveil Ridge]] is the newest part of [[Duskmire]]. 

At least three major powers control territory in this area:

(1) [[Lord Serenveil]]. An ally of [[Archfey Ethlenn]], although exactly how close an ally is not determined, and this may be more of a "joint enemies of [[Lord Umbraeth]] than anything else." Serenveil has his own interests in the Material Plane, and is the patron of a secret cult that involves many of the  [[de Brunes]] and possibly others. The details of this cult are unknown but may eventually become relevant to the Addermarch campaign. In any case, Serenveil is through the 1710s and 1720s actively working against Umbraeth's expansion. Territory in gray, below; red cross-hatches show active conflict with Umbraeth. 

(2) [[Morlaith]], also known as Grymholt, the Briarheart, Keeper of the Thornweald, Lord of the Hidden Hollows. Morlaith is an ancient entity, a being perhaps predating even the arrival of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. Once controlled more territory, but has gradually shrunk to claim now mostly the hills and river valleys of western Addermarch. Morlaith is very explicitly not interested in the Ethlenn/Umbraeth conflict, and generally sees humans as insignificant, not worth even thinking about as they last only a blink of an eye. Vibe is very much the kind of "old world European" classic fairy tale. Morlaith is deeply dangerous, but not in the way Umbraeth for example is actively investing in messing with humans. Many of the ancient standing stones around Addermarch may warn of Morlaith. 

(3) [[Calanthe|Lady CalanthÃ«]], Sentinel of the Setting Sun, is a close ally of [[Archfey Ethlenn]], who guards a realm congruent with the hills on the western border of Tyrwingha, in eastern Addermarch. Minimal details invented here.

%% Discord Notes Below %%

the main vibe i want to maintain is that addermarch feels very distinct from tyrwingha. while tyrwingha is protected by ethlenn, addermarch is explicitly contested, so you never know if the fey you encounter is "good" or "bad", using those terms very loosely

with a rough sense of "better" as you go north, while also not requiring anything "bad" towards the south to be explicitly duskmire, as darkfall is also right on the border

 so looking at the map - my sense is the "contested area" is really Addermarch, the Enst river valley, and maybe as far north as the Wistel, but the Semb valley and the highlands are something else potentially left undefined for now, but likely either solidly allied with Ethlenn and uncontested (Semb valley) or just outside the context of the Umbraeth / Ethlenn conflict (Highlands, which might have their own problems with Sharpspire)

yeah that makes sense

I'd like it to spread as far north as wistel, but I see the wistel as kinda the dividing line between "southern sembara" and "sembaran heartland" and I think the Gloomshaper influence should somewhat align with that, although it doesn't have to be perfect

but I think broadly from the Darkwood in the south to the Wistel in the north and from Aveil/Rinburg in the west to the sunset gate in the east is about correct

also duskmire should stretch east as far as the Aveil hills and the river valley in Aveil, although it doesn't need to go as far east as Rinburg

I think it is useful if for "reasons" the newest part of Duskmire (i.e. around Cleenseau wood) is the "best"

(1) Lord Serenveil's territory is in gray, roughly along the eastern Enst valley. This is [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]]'s patron and the fey lord behind the de Brune cult; aligned with Ethlenn and antagonist to Umbraeth, but may have own motivations. 

(2) Red hashes show active conflict between Serenveil and Umbraeth. 

(3) Green shows something else - not sure what the name is, but some very ancient fey entity, long predating Umbraeth and Duskmire, maybe a relic of the mythic age or something else weird. allied with no one; territory has shrunk considerably but still retains significant power in heart of ancient domain. barrier to Umbraeth's expansion. vibes are not yet clear but will likely be directly relevant to addermarch adventure. 

(4) Black arrows show incurisions from Darkfall across the Sunset Gate 

(5) Blue shows a second ally of Ethlenn, maybe a close ally/underling more directly kind of a splinter realm of Twilight's Grace. 


Questions:

- Serenveil's territory could extent to the Wisford, or there could be an additonal minor lord on his northern border. Have no opinion here.

- Aure valley is a little undefined, although the feywild along the Aure south of Adderfell is likely dangerous and an area of conflict between ancient green entity, Duskmire, blue Ethlenn ally, and Darkfall
