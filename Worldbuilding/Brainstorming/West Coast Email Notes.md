I started fleshing out the history of the west coast of Taelgar a bit last night so I could flesh out the treasure in a dragon lair that Isaac's group is going to fight, a black dragon obsessed with gathering the relics of fallen empires, whose lair is in the Blackwater Fens (big swampy area south of Forest of Dreams, north of Chardon/Voltara, right at the top of the current world printed world map). Would be curious about your opinion.


I. Drankor

First, the basic Drankorian history: westward expansion is more a violent conquest than a slow assimilation, and many of the northerners are driven north and east during the advance, and the rest are more forcibly assimilated. This is much more "European conquest of the Americas" than "Romanization of Spain" (i.e. Sembara) -- but also the west coast is pretty sparsely populated overall pre-Drankor. The Drankorian expanse kind of peters out around Lake Valandros - they cannot push eastward into the elven / Deno'qai forests, because elves, and Mawar is established around this time as a defensible territory not worth Drankorian effort to attempt to conquer. Going further upriver from the lake stretches the empire, and once the cross-mountain trade routes are established momentum fades.

  

II. Great War

After the collapse of Drankor, Chardon survives of course and you have some unsettled history with probably some wars between Mawar / coastal northerners and post-Drankor entities, plus the establishment of a variety of small and short lived kingdoms that are some kind of northerner/Drankorian hybrid. I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about this period as the kingdoms it eventually gets organized into all vanish in the Great War. 

  

But I did want to figure out the pre-Great-War state. Here is say maybe 1500 DR or so (about 50 years before Great War): 

  ![[west-coast-history-GreatWar.png]]

The red area is basically the old borders of the Drankorian empire. Chardon itself commands a small-ish hinterlands, mostly up the Chasa river valley and the coast to the south, but then along the fertile coast to the north you have a series of minor kingdoms that are largely Drankorian in culture and attitude, competing/trading city states mostly. This is probably kind of like what modern-day Cymea is. Kin-Aska, up the Chasa river valley where Arendum is now, would be part of this tradition. But Chardon is the most powerful of these, and during the Great War these all coalesce under Chardon's banners. T

  

The green areas are northerners. The Deno'qai - all the various tribes and settlements - continue to occupy the highland forests, with some migration to account for wars, Cha'mutte's expansion, etc. Now (1748 DR), Chardon is beginning to push up against Deno'qai territory and conflict is growing, but historically they were allies and trading partners. Mawar is established during the late Drankor period and is also a major cultural influence in the pre-Great-War era, probably in part in conflict with the "yellow kingdoms," and trading / allies with the coastal northerners (haven't decided much about these - for now they are considered similar to Mawar but there is space up there for a variety of other northern cultures as needed). 

  

The blue areas are firstborn -- elves, mostly, with a small dwarven kingdom in the mountains between kingdom 2 and kingdom 5. 

  

My main area of interest is what I am calling the Five Kingdoms (although not all are monarchies), the area basically between the old border of Drankor and the Forest of Dreams. These are basically the various polities that emerge out of the Drankorian satellite kingdoms that are a mix of Drankorians and assimilated Northerners. No detailed history / politics, just a few sentence sketches to flavor treasure and ruins. Here is what I have so far, realizing that not everything needs to be fleshed out. 

  

1. <NEED A NAME>. Possibly just a bog-standard medieval feudal kingdom. In kind of a weird spot, I can't figure out what it would do exactly. Might just skip this one and leave to fill in later if desired.

  

2. Amani (most of the territory of what was Amn in our HS campaign). Led by a hereditary line of mage-kings, a country where magic was power, but magical training was centralized and controlled by the royal family (unlike, e.g. modern day Chardon or Drankor historically). Arion Mistspeaker was a prominent mage originally from Amani and his style of esoteric, isolated research into lost magics of the other planes was very much in the Amani tradition. Controlled chalyte mines near modern-day Voltara and probably an early pioneer in chalyte use, but not really for creating common magic items for the masses. Otherwise feudal in culture, perhaps tending to autocratic. Economy largely agrarian, with a fair bit of mining and being middlemen for the Goldpeak dwarves thrown in. 

  

3. Volganis (conceptually equivalent to what was Volkrad in our HS campaign). Frontier oriented. More northern than Drankorian in flavor, but tinged with militarism - perhaps shares some cultural similarities with the Sembaran highland kingdoms, but I imagine this as a bit more authoritarian, probably a monarchy but where there are fewer independent power bases outside the royal family. Pretty marginal land so the economy may depend more on tolls from lucrative Dwarven/Sembaran trade, which will probably entirely go to the crown. 

  

4. <NEED A NAME>. I think this is a frontier place, probably not a lot of big cities, if any, especially given it is pretty marginal land, I think the population density would have been pretty low, and probably no real organized central government, so this is more a collection of many smallholdings and such. I think here you'd find a lot of the old frontier ideas about Mos Numena and the temple steward / priest dynamic where the temple steward probably doubles in many of these small villages as the mayor, and the settlements that grown to any size are the ones that have a real priest to protect them. Center of at least a couple of post-Drankor frontier-based religious organizations. Kind of a buffer zone - probably most under attack from weird evil things, plus hobgoblins (in the mountains), orcs, things in the swamp. Some territory might be nominally claimed / controlled by Amani and/or Volganis. I think historically the Blavkwater Fens were smaller - the dragon's lair is in a ruined chapel so kind of thinking about the religious angle for that reason. 

  

5. Tarbeca. Small coastal polity. Also more Northerner than Drankorian in focus. Almost all the population concentrated in urban coastal centers as interior slopes of mountains are rough and rocky but narrow coastal plain fertile and climate mitigated by Great Bay (but doesn't get the storms Mawar does).

  

III. Current day  

  

In the present day, the elves of course are mostly gone and the big kingdoms have vanished/turned inward/hidden themselves. The Deno'qai are expanding and now starting to come into conflict with the also-expanding Chardonian Empire, which now stretches north to Voltara and claims all the territory of kingdom 1 and parts of what was once Amani. Mawar had a bit of a renaissance but is now in a period of retrenchment. The northern plains north of Voltara were ruled by orcs until recently, and hobgoblins controls the former territory of the Goldpeak dwarves (blue), spilling into the plains. What was kingdom 4 is now true wildlands. 

  

I think some of Tarbeca probably survived the Blood Years and is now a polity on the northern border of Chardon. The coastal northerners also survived but pushed dramatically to the coast. Most of kingdom 1 was not destroyed, necessarily, but is now swallowed up by Chardon. Amani and Volganis are totally destroyed. 

  

Anyway, just kind of poking around. Let me know if you have thoughts/comments/expansions.
