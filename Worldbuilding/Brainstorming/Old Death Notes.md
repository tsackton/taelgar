A collection of old notes about death and funerals, probably obsolete, but should check.

Tim:
Going back to our Sembaran funeral conversation, this could be something like in the Chardonian tradition the body in embalmed and there are prescribed prayers for the 10 days until the soul reaches its final home. But the Mawar tradition which draws heavily from Northern folk ancestor worship, the focus is on the passage of the soul to the keeping of the ancestors who will guide it to its final destination. So there is a burial / cremation immediately, with grave goods to draw the ancestors. 


Not sure what exactly would be taboo, maybe as simple as burying an “unblessed” body. Could derive from Drankorian suppression, or different cultural assumptions about where undead come from.

Mike:
I don't know if you had a chance to look at my funerary traditions document, but my idea about the taboo was derived from the Drankorian and now Chardonian idea that the Mos Numena cannot hear you very well if you are not talking to just one god at a time.

A plausible result of this would be the idea that a body shouldn't be buried with signs and symbols of the gods, because then the Mos Numena divines can't hear / find the soul very well and it is more likely to get lost in the Land of the Dead. So burying someone (in the Chardonian view) with a holy symbol would be a distraction and a danger to the soul of that person.

(It wouldn't be taboo per se in that it doesn't create undead, or cause problems for society. But a religious Chardonian would find it very upsetting to risk their child's immortal soul, for example).

  

The Mawar tradition, on the other hand, emphasizes guidance of the ancestors and semi-divine, and thus burying / embalming the body with these grave tokens is culturally very significant. Because without the grave tokens, the ancestors can't find the soul to bring it through the Land of the Dead.

  

The disagreement Wazir and his wife had would therefore be more of a private one -- it isn't illegal to bury the dead in the Mawar style, but the Chardonians would at least believe it risks the soul of the one buried. 

  

Where Wazir went wrong was in stealing the body of his second son, which really would be a crime (in the same sense the parent without custody is seen as kidnapping their child, and in the same way, the disfavored culture is the one without rights).

  

This all raises an interesting question of who is right? Is it really a problem to embalm a body with grave tokens? 

  

My assumption is, although this area is somewhat fraught with mystery and uncertainty, none of the human cultures 'have it wrong', in the sense that what they are doing is just incorrect. So it must be the case that ultimately, either tradition ends up with good results. One thought I had though is that the outer planes are obviously complex and magical. And perhaps how you enter the divine's realm really does make some difference in what facent/dimension of the realm you experience.

  

So you could imagine the Warlord does in fact oversee a heavenly realm, which really is full of the souls of many of the dead who follow the varied strands of Mos Numena. But depending on how the soul got there -- from the guidance of human priests (Chardon/Drankor), or the guidance of the Night Queen herself (Sembara), or the guidance of an ancestor spirit (Mawar) the place is a little different -- like multiple different realms taking up the same space, somehow. And so you might have the occasional story of a resurrected soul, who really does believe, from their particular experience of the Warlord's realm, that the Mawar rarely find their way to this realm.

  

And a resurrected Mawar could in fact report, with some honesty, that the Chardonians really aren't here. Or at least not many of them.

Tim:
  
Two quick things, though.

  

First, I think it is also reasonable for Chardon religious tradition to inherit some of the old Drankorian prejudices -- after all when the Drankorians came north (on the west of the mountains), they were in more of an expansionist phase, they did to a certain extent probably try to drive some of the local northern traditions extinct, and there could be a very "heathen" sense about grave goods. This could persist into the current day, so it isn't illegal, but definitely something that feels far enough away from normal Chardonian traditions that you can't just easily blend them together. Really easy to imagine a fight about whose cultural tradition to follow when a child dies, even if there are no obvious metaphysical stakes. 

  

Second, I think the concern about souls being misled/stolen for unclear purposes could be a real fear, not just the idea that it would be harder for the Mos Numena to hear. There would likely be some debate in Chardonian theological circles about what actually all the various saints and demigods of the Mawar tradition are, in reality, and plenty of people would believe that at least some of them are not real gods in the sense they are not metaphysically connected to the Eight Divines. And lots more would probably believe even if they are real, they lead souls elsewhere, not to the normal realm of the Mos Numena or whatever. So, in some sense, it becomes not a matter of whether your child's soul will be lost, but a question of whose family a child's immortal soul will spend eternity with. Easy to imagine this being a real, difficult conflict for cross-cultural marriages. 

  

Does this actually happen? I'm sort of inclined to say not usually, especially in the sense that people's souls don't really necessarily persist as distinct entities once they reach their final resting place. But what is real here probably doesn't really matter and I would prefer not to commit to anything, since there may come a point in one or more campaigns where PCs travel to other planes (or where one of you actually dies and is resurrected) and I want to keep what the gods' domains are like a bit loose and flexible. Currently not even sure if there is one "Mos Numena" realm or one for each god or what. Or do some share domains? Virtually all resurrected souls are resurrected while still in the Land of the Dead (since otherwise you are talking about 7th level magic which is exceedingly rare), so much more is known about the Land of the Dead than the various other planes (although there would be various myths from Drankor, for sure, which definitely had mages with plane shift and clerics with resurrection).
