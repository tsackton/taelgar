Some of this should probably be split off into more general brainstorming, as it touches more than just Avatus

## Important Canonical Points

Trying to consolidate a few canonical facts that are critical to preserve in any redeveloped history of Avatus:

- Avatus had a strong connection to arcane magic via a powerful hobgoblin court wizard, who crafted at least one powerful magic item (the Mirror of Soul Trapping), and likely others including cursed items/relics that have appeared in Addermarch (serpentine dagger, serpentine battle axe) and Cleenseau (orb of zombie creation) campaigns. 
- Avatus attacks Sembara in DR 1420s, and conquers Cleenseau, which he rules from DR 1425 - DR 1427
- Derik I defeats Avatus in DR 1427 and forges modern Sembara in the aftermath of victory 
- Avatus occupies the Enst river valley, the Duchy of Masseau, and likely parts of Andonne and Aurbez though this is less clear
- Avatus invades but does not occupy Addermarch, though the exact details are not yet established. The key canonical vibe is that battles were fought in land that is now Addermarch, and some places may have been temporarily occupied, but Adderfell was never conquered and Addermarch as a whole did not fall to Avatus. At least the western frontier has to have some battle sites. 
- Avatus never conquers Tyrwingha, and presumably never makes it north of the Wistel, though whether the northern extent of Avatus' reach is strictly canonical and established in-game is not entirely clear. 
- Avatus never conquers Isingue

Some things that are consistent in notes but might not be canonical, depending on what has been introduced in play:

- Many notes suggest Avatus conquered much of what is now the western marches of Sembara, potentially as far north as the southern borders of Ardlas along the [[Bollin]]. Unclear whether this is necessary to support details introduced in play or whether this is a historical invention. 
- Several notes mention werewolves as a major force in Avatus' armies, potentially suggesting a connection to Jinnik and Pandemonium. This is likely a remnant from early "modern era" worldbuilding when Cha'mutte was still conceptualized as connected to Pandemonium, due to his origin as a werewolf in the high school campaign who turned into a cool enough villain to be retconned into something more elaborate.  

## An Attempt at a Unified Narrative

### General Notes

Basically have ~3 periods between Fall of Drankor and the Great War:

**Post-Drankor Chaos**

Immediately after the fall of Drankor, there is clearly chaos in a variety of places. This could have many causes - the combination of Apollyon's rule, remnants of the Cleansed, famines caused by sudden loss of magical transport, lots of "big bads" showing up because of the loss of Drankor's protective envelop, even interplanar disruptions and incursions. 

The post-Drankor chaos, which starts in DR 1059 with the fall of Drankor, and ends roughly 1150-1200 with the basic post-Drankor world in very roughly in place. In particular, by around 1200, you Dunmar established, Chardon established, the basic framework of the Six Duchies of Sembara established, although a lot will still change. By this stage presumably Isingue is established as the core of a growing agricultural heartland as well, though this history is not canonical. The end of this period sees the world coming out of a long series of wars and famines, and there is a lot of unsettled land. 

**The "Middle Ages"**

Basically the period of growth, expansion, war, change that happens after the recovery from the Drankor crash and before the preamble to the Great War starts changing things. This is roughly 1200 - 1500, give or take. The major event that is well-chronicled during this time is the unification of Sembara. This period ends sometime between the death of Derik I and Vimfrost's War, more or less. 

**The Great War**

The "Great War", which is roughly 1500 - 1545, the events leading up to and including the Great War; this period is dominanted by war in many parts of the world as Cha'mutte begins marshaling his forces, and ends with the defeat of Cha'mutte at Urlich Monastery. 

---

Realistically, the main period we care about in detail is the "middle ages". 

The post-Drankor crises might be a fun time to set a game sometime, and this is a fertile period for things like old legends of dragon attacks and giant overlords, but realistically we can assume that few historical records survive from this era, and we can generally ignore the "how did the post-Drankor order get set up" for now. 

The "Great War" period is also worth revisiting at some point, but largely functions to set up the parts of the high school campaign we want to retain in world history. In particular, most of this history is oriented around positioning Dunmar, Chardon, Isingue, and Sembara to be the major powers that ally to fight against Cha'mutte. 

The middle period has a few clear trendlines / canonical facts:

In the west, the coastal powers of Mawar and Castrella are particularly dominant, but Chardon is growing as an industrial and magical power. A number of realms (Amani, Volganis, Kin-Aska, others) are established but destroyed during the brutal Conclave War and the subsequent wars. There is a lot of space for lost history here, but generally speaking the history of this region has little bearing on current day realms, as the Conclave War and subsequent events were basically a reset. 

In the south there is a well-established framework for Dunmari history, with the fall of the [[Aatmaji Dynasty]] and the rise of Jita and the [[Dharajun Dynasty]], which leads up to the Great War. 

On the Green Sea, the Skaer and Cymea compete for maritime supremacy. 

Sembara has a clear trajectory, growing from the Six Duchies to a true kingdom under Derik I. 

Many brainstorming notes have a Cymea <-> Isingue <-> Dunmar <-> West trade axis, with Sembara a backwater, cut off by Avatus.

### A Possible History

So, one version of events has something like this, focusing on Greater Sembara / Upper Istaros:

- By ~1250 or so, you have Isingue firmly established as a major cultural center around a growing network of fairly democratic communities. Probably stretching from something like modern day Uzgukhar, west to Dunmar, and north into something like modern day March of Andonne. To the north is small, poor duchies and independent kingdoms in what is now Massaeu. To the east whatever is in south Cymea. To the northeast Orenlas and Cymea, and then Addermarch and Tyrwingha.
