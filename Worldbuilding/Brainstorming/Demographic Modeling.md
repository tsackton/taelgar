This document contains some notes on pre-Downfall demographic modeling, although it is not clear how important it is (as any target population size can be made to worth just by tweaking family sizes).

#### Demographics (Non-Human)

I did a little demographic modeling of the Eldar races, and with various reasonable assumptions, you end up with elves around 1.5mi, stoneborn 30k, lizardfolk 230k, dwarves 7.5m and halflings 3.5m at downfall of Hkar. Which makes a lot of sense: elves + dwarves are major races, with elves making up for lower pop numbers with more powerful magic. Halflings are around at about same level of humans, stoneborn rare, and lizardfolk mostly concentrated in their homelands along south and east of green sea (~200k) with only scattered outposts elsewhere (30k). 

My basic model is that most races are created with 5k individuals or so, but the first 2-3 generations have 2x-3x typical growth rates as mortality is low/zero, so you rapidly ramp up to ~10-50k. Then, just assume constant growth until the downfall. 

This assumes the age set / non-overlapping generations of elves, that lizardfolk and stoneborn both have long periods of fertility, very low per-year birth rates with moderately sized families, but also very low death rates. Basically, these are ~approx modeled on modern US, assuming very little infant mortality, long life expectancy, and high fraction of elderly in population. Lizardfolk are assumed to have slightly higher average family sizes to get a bit higher growth rate.

Dwarves and halflings are a bit more “baby boom US” family sizes, and slightly tweaked other parameters, to give somewhat higher growth rates. For dwarves this is through tendencies towards larger families, for halflings mostly through higher fraction of population of reproductive age.

During the downfall, elves suffer most, then dwarves almost as much. Other races lose <10% of pop. Lizardfolk migrate south in large numbers; stoneborn and halflings less affected.

Does this fit with the cultural implications of dwarves? Previous discussions had pushed against dwarves experiencing a downfall/catastrophe like the elves

yeah, going to revise this down a fair bit. for dwarves, would be like WW1 in France -- still idea of a Lost Generation, and definitely impacted them significantly, but it was not an existential threat to the race.  
  
that would imply about 5% mortality, with maybe another 20% of the population displaced.  
  
I think dwarves in part start living with humans because they are displaced out of the deep underground. so in both Downfall and Great War mortality is much less than elves (5%, maybe up to 10%), but both involve a lot of displacement as well, which is where you get the ancient dwarven ruins under the mountains.

This leads to current day "northwest" population is maybe 200k elves, 50k stoneborn, 500k lizardfolk, 20m dwarves, 20m halflings, which feels about right.

But this has no implications for when humans are created, really. By ~1600-1800 those who can remember the days of creation, even among elves, are rare, so end of “period 2” could be as early as 1600 and as late as 2500 or so. 

#### Demographics (Human)

Human demographics have a bigger impact on the timing, since the question of where to put the boundary between period 2 and period 3 is largely one of how long should humans have to grow before the downfall of Hkar?

My mucking around with numbers kinda seems like we should just decide. Ultimately, you can generate whatever population number you want by tweaking the growth rate up to 0.5% or down to 0.1%, both of which have rational explanations within the Taelgarian universe.  
  
Nothing says on the paradise of Hkar humans couldn't be growing at 2% a year, which is the 20th c. historical growth rate. But if there is limited infant mortality, not that hard to get to it
