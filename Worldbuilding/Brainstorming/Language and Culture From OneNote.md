## Reworking Language and Culture
## Humans

Six major groups of humans:

1. West Northlanders (current day called just Northlanders, live north of Chardon)
2. East Northlanders (current day Skaer, Varsta, and people east of here, but north of Green Sea)
3. "Central" people (current day Dunmari and descendents/relations)
4. East Southerners (islands and further south - continent B)
5. West Southerners (Continent C)
6. Hkari (current day descendants of the Drankorian Empire, plus settlers on other continents)

Humans were created in Hkar in 2473.

Most humans stayed and proposed on Hkar for the next 1500 years, while the non-human races spread across the other continents

However, some humans left Hkar, and spread slowly across the continent. Many settled the central, equatorial region and the lush plains to the north (which would become desert in the 3rd Age after the sinking of Hkar) - these became the central/Dunmari people

Others traveled north (West/East northlanders) or South (West/East Southerners).

With the fall of Hkar, the vast bulk of people who survived fled east, many landing near Drankor but some landing on continent B/C.

By the current age:

-The West Northlanders departed Hkar very early and are the most distinct; using Semitic/Arabic languages

-The Southerners were next, perhaps Asian and north American languages?

-The East Northlanders, a late departure from Hkar, largely got pushed further and further east across the plains and steppes north of the Green Sea; they use Slavic/Russian/Germanic languages. The people who used to live in Sembara and areas around used Celtic languages, but were assimilated into Drankroian empire

-Central people also late departure, using Hindi and Persian languages

-Hkari spread north, now both sides of mountains, Sembara etc; these are Romance languages / English / German / French; with a more classical Greek/Roman/Italian feel on the west of the mountains.

So, for names:

- The bits of Northlander culture left north of Chardon, including the islands, should use vaguely Arabic/Semitic names
- The rumors of lands to the south would, in their own culture, use something different (Asian?), can have a Chardonian name for now

# Ideas for Countries

Theocracy (priest-king of XXX), with different god than other areas, maybe monotheistic, could work for Skaegish; definitely an island

Small city-states, in a loose confederacy (Cymea)

"Classic" medieval constitutional monarchy (Sembara - but maybe complicate a bit with vassal states and an area in the north that is newly independent kingdom?)

Loose monarchy (Dunmar)

Highly magical empire (Chardon)

Dwarven vassal states - these could be newer kingdoms?

Something heavily influenced / led by the fey, perhaps secret remnants of an older civ?

A few 'rugged individualist / frontier' areas, kind of Beornlings

At least 1-2 places ruled by an absolute ruler, either some kind of monarch/mage, or an autocrat/warlord, or something like a pharaoh. Maybe something Red Wizards of Thay, ish?

A place with competing warlords (Vostok?)

Closed island civ (western islands)

Something kind of like Athens, more democratic (Free City of Tollen?)

Some oligarchic / mercantile places (on Green Sea?)

In general, if we assume that Sembara, Cymea, and Vostok actually represent loose collections of culturally related independent entities, can have a fair bit of diversity around the green sea, mirroring roughly England, Germany, Italy in medieval Europe. Plus Tollen, and probably want some more magical stuff for diversity / fantasy interest.

In terms of filling the map, don't need to worry about what is east yet.

Area between Sembara and Dunmar needs some attention - parts are hobgoblin / Cinder Court, but probably not entirely unsettled, especially along the mountains. A place for Beornling types? Fey types? Something else?

North of Dunmar/Chardon border also open area that could be 'frontier'.

Emerald Bay islands - refugee / pirate civ? Basically a vassal state of Chardon now, but recently conquered?

On the actual penisula - what? Again need some more diversity in this area, but this is largely well-controled by Chardon

Heading north - things less controlled. Several island nations, and then north of Voltara there is what, exactly? At least a few different civs.

DMG has ideas. Add to this with other ideas, look at Eberron and Wildemount and other "gazeteers" but try to avoid the usual D&D-esque stuff.

Initial importance is areas south/west/east of Voltara, and Chardon/Dunmar border.
