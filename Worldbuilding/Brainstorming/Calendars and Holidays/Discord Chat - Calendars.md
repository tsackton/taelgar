what do you think of "starday, sunday, moonsday, lightsday, waterday, godsday, freeday" for days of the week? close enough to sat/sun/mon/tues/wed/thurs/fri for understandability

i'm going to use those for now but easy enough to change. more difficult is the months, although may change those too at some point

also taelgar has no leap days. someday if we revise the months might add some intercalary days but they would be fixed every year.

It‚Äôs really easy to get the template working with current year

fiddling around with calendar ideas a bit while eating lunch. I think that it would be interesting to have the original Hkar/Drankorian calendar be much more reminiscent of a Mayan-style calendar than traditional European/Mesoptamian lunisolar calendrs. so maybe in Hkar you have a ritual cycle of 50 weeks, each of 7 days, plus 15 intercalary days that make up a 365 day year. months are for convenience, and consist of 10 months of 5 weeks each.

it is the mariner tradition that creates a lunisolar calendar

when the Drankorian empire falls, the intercalary days are dropped/forgotten about, and you get a synchronization with the mariner-derived lunisolar calendar

main modern day implication would be that Mos Numena holidays probably shouldn't be lunar oriented, and instead would most likely be associated with solar year landmarks (solistice/equinox), or fixed dates for various reasons

because a year in exactly 365 days in taelgar, you don't need leap years and solar-year landmarks are always fixed to a specific date. that means you could also do something like have a holiday that was originally the first day of the last week of the 6th month and have that be celebrated on june 28th every year for reasons no one is quite sure why now
