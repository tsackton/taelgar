Some rough calculations around the ritual calendar for Mos Numena. would be good to pull in some holiday discussions from discord.

The idea is to have the following holidays (just random brainstorming, see [[Discord Chat - Holidays]]) for more)

* Wyrdling ([[Pyravela]])
* Wanderer x2 (homecoming & leavetaking, winter & early spring)
* Sibyl - deeply secret over the summer
* Night Queen overnight thing
* Autumn Warriors thing
* Sunrise father

One other idea:  Mos Numena holiday of thanksgiving / salvation that marks escape from Hkar?
