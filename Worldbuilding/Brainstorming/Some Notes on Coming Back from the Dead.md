This page collects various notes on coming back from the dead; probably should be made canonical at some point but at the moment this is all just straight dumps from email:

Re: resurrection, I've thought about this a fair bit and I think in Chardon, despite the "high magic" feel, resurrection would still be very rare, given that it is the province of Divine magic, and this is not necessarily something Chardon has in abundance, or at least not in nearly as much abundance as arcane magic. Because of the reality of the gods, it is somewhat hard for temples to be completely co-opted for civilianÂ political purposes, but resurrection requires extremely valuable and rare diamonds, which makes it vulnerable. I do think that there would be a growing move by the imperial powers to control the diamond trade in the 1710s, and to a certain extent this gets caught up in the chalyte trade as well -- the Chardonian political elite begin to exert a lot of their power by controlling the components required for powerful magic. This period, in the shift in outlook from 1680 to 1720, is also when the Magistros (emperor) of Chardon shifts to being effectively a hereditary position, instead of something kind of Doge-like elected by the magical and mercantile aristocracy. So during this period the attitude among the political elite definitely begins to shift towards a much more inward-looking posture, or at least it becomes the case that favors become hard to come by for those not in the inner circle, which tend to be family members of the Magistros.
