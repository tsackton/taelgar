# Climate in Taelgar

This page collects brainstorming and background notes on climate in Taelgar. Note that the [[Climate Map|climate map]] should be generally considered definitive if it conflicts with this page.

This is not written in a way that would make sense to publish, and it makes heavy use of the [Köppen Climate Classification](https://www.mindat.org/climate.php).

Note that this is a record of various brainstorming conversations, I think largely/entirely complete, although it does not include a wide range of discussion about the "MTP" and other central Green Sea issues that only lightly touch on climate. Many climate details on are main pages.

##  Green Sea

Some classifications of common places:

* Insingue - Cwa/BSk
* Sembara - Dwa to Dwb in highlands
* Cymea - Dfa to Cfa in south
* Tyrwingha - Dfa
* "Eastern Dunmari Peninsula" - Cwa bit of Aw/As

Reminders about climate types:

* Cwa and Cfa are both sub-tropical - think Southeastern US, where Cfa is more rainfall year round.

Big desert south of green sea, not totally placed yet on map. Think about location -- shift north a bit maybe -- to put it more centrally in the horse latitudes and approx where Sahara is.

### Sembara

In the Sembara area, the weather is driven by westerly winds especially in the northern Green Sea, plus a winter high / summer low that develops over the northern interior plains. In the winter, the high pressure system enhances the westerlies and you get cold, dry winds out of the north. In the summer, the land heats faster than the ocean, so the wind reverses (giving you the monsoon) and you get summer onshore winds that bring rains, especially to Sembara and the southern and Vostok "lakes" region, and to a lesser extent the Vostok coast. But with the mountains, the rain doesn't reach the northern plains, which get little rain year round. Further east, you get snow, basically a lake effect off the green sea with the winter westerlies. In Sembara, though, most snow would probably be associated with high elevations, or big winter storms, basically when you get a no'easter coming up the Cymea peninsula. But these would be much more common in Vostok than central Sembara. 

  

The western coast is much more like Scandinvia, with long snowy winters, since here the winter high enhances the westerlies bringing snow from the ocean. But the warm current modulates things so not as cold as further east (the high plains north of Vostok, for example). 

  

Further south you get a mild Mediterraen climate with mild wet winters and warm summers in Chardon and then another monsoon in southern Dunmar, and another high ridge over central Dunmar that keeps it very dry in the winter and only occasional rain in the summer (because of the Yuvanti rain shadow); then south of the Green Sea, to the east, you basically have northern Africa, but with a thicker strip of vegetation/non-desert along the coast before you hit the interior desert.

  

The far south isn't really detailed yet but doesn't matter for any current campaign.

  

In many ways, the world map is roughly like Eurasia but if you put the Mediterranean in China, squashed SE Asia a bit, broke India up into a bunch of islands, and put Africa south of Indonesia.

**Sembara [Dwa and Dwb]**

Winters are cold and dry, but snow is common when precipitation falls. Summers are long and hot and wet, and there are real spring and fall seasons. Some small regional effects along the coast from the Green Sea create wetter winters than the rest of Sembara, and Embry and the coastal Northlands see more snow than the highlands. In the north (Zovcka) and the higher regions (Aine Hills, Braebine, much of the highland kingdoms) it can be cool (Dwb), with even the summers rarely getting above 70. But in much of the rest of Sembara summers can be very hot (Dwa).

  

This is similar to Manchuria, and parts of the Russian Far East.

  

**Tyrwingha [Cfa]**

The coastal influence moderates the winters here, and it is milder than elsewhere in Sembara. Winters don't get as cold as in Embry, and even the coldest months are usually above freezing. 

  

Think Tokyo.

  

**Tollen and the Volta Delta [Dwa]**

The areas of Vostok along the far south coast of the Green Sea and around Tollen are milder than the rest of Vostok, and usually get warmer in the summers than the rest of Vostok. Climate is similar to Beijing, although with perhaps a slightly less skewed distribution of rain, and without the spring dust storms.

**Vostok [Dwb and Dwc]**

Cool summers, rarely above 70, and long, cold winters. Summers are wet and in the southern parts, can be quite hot. The northern and highland areas have cool summers. The winters are universally dry, except perhaps along the coast.

  

This is similar to parts of southern Siberia, eastern Russia, and northern Mongolia.

  

**Skagenland [Dfb]**

Cool summers and long, relatively mild winters, but the moisture from the Green Sea keeps the precipitation even across the seasons, more so than to the west. Spring can be foggy and damp, 

  

Think Nova Scotia or Newfoundland.

  

**Northern Plains [Bsk]**

North of Vostok and Sembara is a very cold, very dry step. Winters are long and brutal, and the cold dry winds blow endlessly from the east. Summer brings brief warmth, but minimal rain. The mountains hem in the land with rain shadows and no ocean moderates the temperature.

  

Similar to northern Mongolia or the Tibetan plateau.   

  

**Cymea [Dfa or Cfa]**

The Green Sea provides moisture even during the dry winters, keeping Cymea somewhat less impacted by the monsoon than most of the rest of the region.  The southern parts of Cymea, and especially the islands to the east, are warmer in winter, rarely getting below freezing. 

  

Think Ohio or Pennsylvania, ranging towards something more like Shanghai in the southern parts.

  

**The South**  

The entire area south of Cymea and Tyrwingha should really be quite dry. The monsoons won't bring summer rain because of the rain shadows of the Cymean mountains, and the large bulk of landmass to the southeast, and the westerlies are always dry in this region, especially blowing off the Dunmari high plateau. In the real world, it might be similar to west Texas or the African subtropical savannahs, or the wetter parts of the Australian outback [Bsh]. That isn't really how the map is drawn though, nor does it 'fit' with the characteristic Taelgar history....

  

A couple of ideas for fixes:

1. If the Cymean mountains are low they wouldn't necessarily produce much of a rainshadow. The eastern part of the region could be fairly similar to Cymea, but with more of a seasonal rain pattern as the winter winds blowing from the west wouldn't have much moisture. 

  

2. Some kind of magical source of the lake & marsh at the corner of Cymea and the lizard swamp. It doesn't rain much, but there is a lot of ground water because of that.

  

Still playing around with this though...

---

Yeah this mostly makes sense with my thinking. I think Cymea is probably a bit more moderate than eg Ohio, since it is surrounded by water, and the inner green sea is probably pretty shallow and warm. There may not be an exact earth parallel because I’m not sure there are “Mediterranean monsoon” climates but that is kind of what I imagine. In some ways almost Irish (wet, rainy all the time) except with warmer. Maybe southern Japan is like that, I don’t know much about Japanese climate. 

  

I think the Cymea mountains are more Appalachians than Alps. So little rain shadow effect, although perhaps a bit higher towards the east. 

  

I think of the whole Mostreve hills from the gap stretching into western Cymea as kind of Blue Hills in Virginia, although probably with slightly colder winters, albeit still without much/any snow. 

  

Further south, you get into the mid latitude highs, and it does get dry. Now it is all ruins, but historically something like Spain except with rain in the summer not the winter. Probably more rain on the eastern slopes of central mountains, where there are some forests, and less in the river valley, due to whatever moisture is left in summer monsoon winds falling as mountains push air up.  

  

I also think while the climate should make some sense it doesn’t need to be perfect.

### Vermillion Isles
The Vermillion Isles are around 37 N, strongly influenced by the ocean, which here is weird and magical. 

Overall climate is maybe vaguely like Portugal or even Azores, but locally Vermillion Isles are very dry, little rain, with most rain falling in inconsistent thunderstorms. Fall/winter a bit wetter than spring/summer, but in general weather all across the eastern islands is chaotic.

### Aurbez Area

The ashen plains (dark red on map). Borderlands of the plaguelands. No real people, but not truly plague-filled. Biggest issue for these places is the polluted Ardonne river and the ash storms. (In 1650 this region would stretch through basically all of the light red region).

The central March of Ardonne (light red on map). Ranchers and open grassland. Dry, similar to say western Kansas or eastern Colorado. Ashy summer storms can cause issues for agriculture so most don't try. Fortified ranches are the main settlements. Some dependence on food imports/trade. Most settlements clustered around the Dunmar Road and the ruins of the Great South Road. (This region is unsettled in 1650 except right along the road)

The river borderlands (pale yellow). A mix of marcher castles protecting small scale irrigation-driven farms, goat-and-sheep herders, and self-sufficient frontier farms that depend on hunting, fishing, small vegetable crops and ranching. Mostly claimed by no kingdom but many of the frontier farms are loyal to Aurbez, and the marcher lords are often loyal to Maseau or Sembara. But the population density (perhaps no more than 2000 people in the whole region) is low enough that there is little conflict. (In 1650, there would have been no Marcher castles here, just a handful of frontier folk and refugees)

The Aurbez Plateau (brown). Colorado Front Range climate. The heart of the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez. Biggest settlements are around the marsher upper Aursen before it spills off the plateau in a series of waterfalls just before the road crosses the river. Most of the people are tucked away in the mountains, especially the southern stretches. I'm still not totally sure what form of polity the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez is, but in 1650 it didn't exist, and the people living here were very similar to the frontier folk of the river borderlands.

## Winds and Rain

- Westerlies: middle latitudes, roughly 35 to 65 degrees, wind blows west to east
- Trades: subtropical/tropical, winds blow from northeast in N. hemi and southeast in S. hemi

So, in Taelgar:
- From ~Chardon north to northern reaches of continent, winds blow west to east.
- From ~GapOfChardon south to equator, winds blow east to west

High pressure zone around 30: stretching across north-central Dunmar, southern Plaguelands, and south edge of Green Sea.

General rainfall / wet season patterns:
- Mediterranean climates tend to have wet winters, dry summers, usually on west side of continents between 30 and 45 degrees; subtropical ridge extends north in summer, high pressure = no rain.
- tropical/subtropical climates tend to have wet summers, dry winters
- monsoons are associated with a shift in the wind
- rainfall in form of heavy late afternoon thunderstorms
- tropical rainy zone moves N/S, reaching furthest north in summer and furthest south in winter

![[Pasted image 20250117160728.png]]

## Dunmar

The climate of Dunmar is defined by the Yuvanti mountains.

West of the mountains, the climate is a moist subtropical climate, with frequent rain, warm winters, and hot summers.

Further south, approaching the coastline of the sea of storms, the climate gets warmer and more fully tropical.

tropical airmasses over Sea of Storms drift north in the summer months, leading to rainy season in the south, especially in the flat coastal plains

the land rises sharply along the western edge of the Yuvanti mountains, creating a rain shadow desert on the other side; these highlands extend east, sloping up to the high peaks of the central mountains

this high desert is very dry

in the subtropical latitudes, prevailing winds blow offshore in the winter, but reverse in the summer, bringing monsoon rains to the Nayan river valley.

Yuvanti mountains are highest in the south, creating the largest rain shadow effect in the Garamjala desert

![[Pasted image 20250117155832.png]]

Darba Hinterlands

(the coastal plains around Darba)

- Once you get through the Darba gap on the "Darba Road" (new road), and rejoin the "South Road",  population density begins to pick up. More villages, less nomadic pastoralists.
- Terrain is rolling hills as you go through the Yuvanti area, to rocky coastal plains/cliffs. More trees, even some small forests here. Warm, savannah-like climate.
- Inns, farms, more travelers, traders coming south from Songara or heading north to Songara then Chardon. Much more settled than other places in Dunmar experienced so far. Patrols not just of Aagir's mystai, but also Nayan Karnas troops.

## Chasa River Valley

The Chasa River valley is rich agricultural land. Kind of Willamette Valley, Burgundy, Central Valley, etc. Climate is mild, a mix of Mediterranean and oceanic (Koppen Cfb/Csb), with wet winters and warm, sunny summers. Lots of wine, especially closer to the coast (Metium is a huge wine producer). Moving further inland the temperatures get hotter in the summer and colder in the winter, but with plenty of rain to support huge forests. The whole broad gentle slope of the mountains to the coastal plain was historically densely forested, although some land has been cleared.

The winters do not get too cold, and there is little snow, supporting temperate evergreen forests / temperate rainforests, dominated by massive trees (e.g. coastal California forests). In the higher elevation slopes of the mountains, this transitions to more conifer-dominated forests, with more snow (going north from the Elderwood you also transition to more conifer forests with more snow, although still not much except at moderate elevations, until you get very far north, beyond the Blackwater Fens).

The economy is highly agrarian, and this is one of the two major "bread baskets" of Chardon (the other being the coastal plains west of Lake Valandros). While there is plenty wheat/grain, this is also where you see vineyards, fruit trees, berries, and diversified agriculture. Also a decent amount of cattle farming.

The summers are dry, and in late August everything will be abundant, luscious, and ripe, but the land is fairly dry and the river is low. The terrain is fields, pasture, and farms interspersed with small stands of trees, especially or perhaps primarily along rivers / streams. Further upstream, you get into more resource extraction, primarily timber, but also furs, leather, other things historically traded with the Deno'qai.


## Mawar

mid-November. The weather is generally in the 40s-50s, with frequent cold rain, but rarely getting below freezing at night and little snow, with the climate somewhat moderated by the ocean.


## Discussion

Re: climate map

I see Sembara is Dwa / Dwb / Dwc. This all makes sense.

North Cymea is Dfa and the Vostok coast and Skaer is Dfb. Makes sense.

  

South Cymea I think you have as Cfa transitioning to Cwa, then to BSk?

I think I'd change that. Have Cfa stretch along the coast all the way to the BSk steppe.

And have an interior band of Cwa stretching from the Mostreve Hills to a little south of the the top of the Dead Forest (replacing the Cfa there), and then push the BSk in the interior.

  

So basically there is a thin stretch of Cfa all the way along the coast, and the existing Cwa area is about half Cwa and half BSk. Then the part of Tyrwingha/Mostreve Hills/elven area that is current Cfa becomes Cwa.

  

Basically move the monsoon influenced area inland and north a bit.

  

The borders of the Plaguelands are all BSk, which makes sense to me, transitioning to BSh as you go south. I think some of the big BWk you have around Garamjala could be BSk or BSh, but I think either is realistic. A lot of that area I imagine a bit like the Australian outback.

  

The big desert should be BWh, not BWk, right? Isn't it Sahara-like?

  

The west coast, starting at the north... I think you have Dfc with a thin broder of Csc?

  

I think more of the west coast could be European (Cfb) which I think you have pretty far south only?

  

I have a few other things I need to do, more later. If you can put a bit of a guide on the map, might be easier...

---
I am still having a hard time envisioning south cymea south and east, to the big desert. Also what is in between Garamjala and the big eastern desert.

  

I think the west coast is basically like the US west coast but stretched out, with Europe on top of it. So in the south you have rain in winter, with a more continental climate with colder winters and hotter summers as you head up into the mountains. As you go further north rain evens out. The big forests on the slopes of the mountains are like redwoods blending into Lake Tahoe style vast mixed pine forest. Further south more like forested areas of eastern Turkey.

---
  
* The big patch of Aw (savannah) just above "the Unknown East" seems a little out of place. Isn't it too far north for true tropical climates? Why not change the "Eastern Dunmar" area to entirely Cfa (basically the entire area between the mountains and the sea that is Cwa right now) except for a thin band of BSh before the desert. 

  

* Then drop the rest of the Aw in just south of the mountains and make it BSh as well. Basically the entire area between the two deserts is BSh

  

The whole stretch from the southern edge of the Green Sea until the Garamjala could be like the east coast of South Africa shading into Zimbabwe/Botswana. Maybe there are elephants and giraffes and such.

  

On the west coast, the things that seem a little off to me are:

  

* The mountains west of Voltara maybe should be Csc rather than Dsb?

* The huge patch of Dsb along the western slopes of the central mountains seems too cold in the south. Maybe the big forested chunk is more Dsa rather than Dsb? 

* The chunk of BSk stretching from Voltara south seems a little out of place... But I guess there is a decent rain shadow from the mountains... I just might push the southern part of the Cfb region near Voltara a bit east? And maybe push the Csa in the river valley north of Chardon all the way to the Csb region, so the BSk is really a more isolated patch in Voltara

  

I think Sembara and Dunmar and the southern areas seem good

It is about 25-26 N, so a bit outside tropics, yes. Cfa is probably better here, agreed.

Yeah, I like this, I think I will add some Cwb (dry winter subtropical highland) along the mountains, giving a bit of a high veld type atmosphere.

The purples are a bit hard to tell apart, this is Dsc, which given how tall these are I think fits.

 > * The huge patch of Dsb along the western slopes of the central mountains seems too cold in the south. Maybe the big forested chunk is more Dsa rather than Dsb? 

This is mostly Dsa; the purples are hard to tell apart.

 > * The chunk of BSk stretching from Voltara south seems a little out of place... But I guess there is a decent rain shadow from the mountains... I just might push the southern part of the Cfb region near Voltara a bit east? And maybe push the Csa in the river valley north of Chardon all the way to the Csb region, so the BSk is really a more isolated patch in Voltara

Yeah, this is supposed to be like a northerly version of the central valley in CA almost; but probably doesn't make sense for it to extend as far south as it does, as below the Cfb region is just rolling hills and a big lake, no real mountains to block the rain.

A few thoughts on the 'blank' areas....

  

Looking at the climate map and the people movements map, it seems like there are a few big blank areas...

  

**The central steppe.** 

  

Between the two major deserts and south of the medium mountain chain that marks the western border of "eastern Dunmar", I think this is a perfect place for orc hordes, weird bad guys, and strange stuff. It isn't great climate in general, being mostly dry. Lots of wild animals. Hard for traders to get through. I'm envisioning it somewhat like Botswana/southern Africa. Probably no meaningful human inhabitants since Drankor fell.

  

This makes the eastern Dunmari more connected along the coast of the Green Sea to Cymea and the neo-east than to the western Dunmari. And if they aren't really seagoing (which is totally culturally reasonable) they could be quite isolated in general. But their land is fairly fertile, maybe still somewhat swampy in places with a bit of a north Florida feel in some places. Or maybe it has a south China feel -- Hong Kong or even Hanoi.

  

**South Cymea**

Maybe it would make sense to move the BSk wider to the north, so the Cwa region starts around the two big lakes.

  

You could then imagine that this is really part of the central steppe. Basically say that Drankor expanded north along the rivers, but South Cymea was always a bit marginal and was never a major population center, except for a strip along the coast. So "south Cymea" is really the southern part of Cymea, maybe culturally distinct, but really much more a strip of civilization along the coast with largely wilderness at their western backs.

  

So basically, you'd have this big central wilderness, stretching from line of the central mountains / the Kharja River, in the west, the Mostreve Hills in the north, the "south Cymean" mountains and the "south/east Dunmar" mountains in the east, and the Sea of Storms in the south that is basically wilderness.

  

Most of this is desert/plaguelands/steppe, but some small patches in the north are Cwa/forest.

  

On the edges of this wilderness are some polities -- the Republic of Auzberg and the various Sembaran southern marches in the north, plus the elven kingdom of Olenas; a somewhat culturally unique "south Cymean" group of folks living in a strip 50-75 miles along the coast; the eastern Dunmari, on the other side of the mountains on their peninsula along the Green Sea.

I like this. I think this central steppe area is a natural "wildlands" that has kind of always been unsettled and difficult. The "frontier" during the Drankorian empire, with little beyond it but desert, so no point in trying to conquer it. This would make the "south/east" culture north of the desert like Vostok in a way, in that it was never Drankorian but was influenced by them.

  

I have actually never been clear in my mind whether the mountains between the deserts are the western or the eastern border of "eastern Dunmar." 

  

One possibility is that before the fall of Cha'mutte, you still have some arid desert in the far east, basically west of the "east Dunmar mountains" and into the interior a bit, like the eastern 25% of the Garamjala, and then to the north you have wetter grasslands shading into forests. Basically, from west to east you have Dunmar, "south Irebor", and "east Dunmar", and then north of those, starting from the Green Sea, "south Cymea" and "Irebor" until the mountains. Dunmar stretches further south, but south of "south Irebor" is wilds shading into Drankor, and south of "east Dunmar" is arid steppe and desert. Then, further east, you have the Hong Kong / Hanoi kind of culture in penisula sticking north into the green sea above the desert.

  

The alternative would be to push the east Dunmari east, into the peninsula. But I actually like having them in the interior of south Cymea, basically, and perhaps wrapping around some along the southern edge of the mountains in an overland route to the peninsula and desert. There would be more survivors here, and I imagine  this as more of mixed culture.

Looking at this some more, there is really no reason why south Cymea would be dry. Further south, due east of Dunmar, yes, you are in the high pressure latitudes and have some mountain rain shadow. But around 35 N should be pretty wet, like SE US or central China.

Yeah, I'm not sure this fits. I think pre-Great War, perhaps there were big forests stretching south from the two lakes and east towards the coast. West of the forest you have Irebor in the river valley, which is wetter to the north and dryer to the south. East of the forest along the coast you have South Cymea, which shades drier as you move south, to a semi-arid steppe on the interior, which is "east Dunmar". Basically say three or four groups, the Ireborians (split perhaps north/south), the south Cymeans, and the east Dunmari. 

  

Post war, Irebor is gone, and south Irebor is the heart of the Plaguelands. The elven kingdom is still there, but much of the big forest is now dead, although not all. Towards the coast, you have south Cymea on the coastal side of the forest, completely cut off from the interior but trading north and south along the coast. Then south of them and shading inland, basically north east of the Garamjala, you have the east Dunmari. The south and east of the east Dunmari you have wilds, which has always been wilds. On the penisula you have a totally different culture, a mixing pot of central/south/east, north of the desert, which was less affected by fall of Drankor and fall of Cha'mutte.
