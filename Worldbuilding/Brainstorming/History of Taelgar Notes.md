Age of Myth and Age of Creation mostly solid. "Third Age" mostly solid, at least in broad strokes. "Fourth Age" and especially "Fifth Age" not necessarily canon. 

# The History of Taelgar

This is the story, as incompletely reconstructed by the wisest of elven scholars and loremasters, of the history of Taelgar, starting with the Elder days, when the world was young and magic strong. It tells the story of the origin of the gods, the birth of the elder races, and the creation of the humans on Hkar, through the downfall of Hkar and the elder empires at the end of the third age of the world, to the story of the fourth age, the rise and fall of the Drankorian empire, the long years of Cha’mutte’s growth in power leading up to the the Great War, ending with the events after Cha’mutte’s downfall, in the current, fifth age of the world.
