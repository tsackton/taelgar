Age of Myth and Age of Creation mostly solid. "Third Age" mostly solid, at least in broad strokes. "Fourth Age" and especially "Fifth Age" not necessarily canon. 

# The History of Taelgar

%%comments
some to-dos:  
1. Still need better names for the ages of the world. Roughly speaking, the vibe is:  
  
* First Age  = gods  
* Second Age = elder races  
* Third Age = humans  
* Fourth Age = war against Cha'mutte  
* Fifth Age = current day in Taelgar  
  
The first, third, and fourth ages end with violence of some kind. First, with Arha and Malik separating the planes; third, with downfall of Hkar and the wars around that; fourth, with war against Cha'mutte.  
  
Second age is marked at beginning and end by creation: starts with creation of the elder races, ends with creation of humans.   
  
For now, have refactored names based on those vibes:  
  
* First Age = Days of Myth  
* Second Age = Age of Creation  
* Third Age   
* Fourth Age   
* Fifth Age = Age of Rebirth

This is the story, as incompletely reconstructed by the wisest of elven scholars and loremasters, of the history of Taelgar, starting with the Elder days, when the world was young and magic strong. It tells the story of the origin of the gods, the birth of the elder races, and the creation of the humans on Hkar, through the downfall of Hkar and the elder empires at the end of the third age of the world, to the story of the fourth age, the rise and fall of the Drankorian empire, the long years of Cha’mutte’s growth in power leading up to the the Great War, ending with the events after Cha’mutte’s downfall, in the current, fifth age of the world.

## The First Age: The Age of Myth

The Age of Myth is the term elves use to refer to the years before time had meaning, when magic was strong and the gods walked the earth. Counted as the first age of the world among the elves, but not reckoned in the count of years by the dwarves, this age stands apart, a time when the world was constantly changed.

### The Origin of the Divine

In the beginning, there was the Void, an endless space that was at once nothing and everything, a formless emptiness in which thought lost all meaning. Into this Void, two beings struggled to come into being, to awaken, to be born. Known most commonly as the Divine Presence, Arha and Malik, representing life and death, creation and destruction, these beings have taken many other names and forms in the annals of myth and legend of the world, and scholars debate their true nature. 

  

As they came into being, Arha and Malik tore through the fabric of the Void. Through these tears, form erupted: the chaotic, roiling energy of the planes of magic, and the formless silver calm of the planes of souls. Feeling this power flow around and through them, Arha and Malik shaped it into form and being, bringing purpose to the chaotic energies of magic, and sculpting from this vast energy the material plane and the world of Taelgar.

  

As Arha and Malik tore through the fabric of the Void, and shaped its energy into creation, something awoke that did not want a world to be, called the Void Mind, or sometimes the Undivine. This utterly alien mind, if that was the right word for it, could not create, even the smallest pebble, for the act of Creation itself was antithetical to its very existence, and it had no power in the realm of Arha and Malik, no magic. However, it could, and did, resist.

### The Children of the Divinity

After Arha and Malik came to be, they were not still. The first entities to exist in the new world of Taelgar were the children of Arha and Malik. Drawing on the varied powers of the multiverse, the Divine Presence gave birth to powerful, magical beings, in these timeless days of myth and legend.

  

From the chaotic energy and strength of the planes of magic, the first dragons were born, the great wyrms. These great wyrms spawned the race of dragons, which spread across the land, albeit only echoes and reflections of the god-like elder wyrms. Dragons are the masters of the energy of the plane of magic, weaving spells and shaping reality. But they do not craft things, they do not build, they only collect what others have made. 

  

From the earth and the sky, the wind and sea, the molten core and solid foundation of the earth itself, the titans were born, again as if gods in power and strength. From them, the race of giants descended, spreading across the land. Giants are the masters of creating and crafting, of twisting reality to create items of great power, embedding runes of power into their work, and shaping the world itself with their magic.

  

From the disparate forces of the elemental planes, the elder elementals gave form and thought to the raw power of the elements. From them, the djinni, the ifreerti, the dao, and the marid were given form and power.   

  

Finally, the last children of the Divine Presence to come into existence were the archfey, reflections of what had come before, but twisted and echoed in the dreamlike world of the Feywild. From the archfey, the fey creatures of the world -- some helpful, others mischievous, or deadly -- spread. 

  

As the children of the Divine spread across the nascent world, the Void mind watched, and waited, sometimes whispering quietly in the minds of great beings that strode through existence, but still without power or form. 

  

The children of the Divine spread during the Age of Myth, before the planes were sundered. As they spread, some built great cities towering over the lands, and others wove dreamscapes of immense power.

  

Arha and Malik, the Divine Presence, looked across the forming world, and were pleased. But something was missing. As great empires of their children rose, and fell, and the world turned and new forms emerged from the old, Arha and Malik saw that while their children could make many things, everything they made was also a reflection, echo or distortion of something else. Nothing remained still long enough to be named and understood, and the world was ruled by chaos. 

### The Long Breath

The Age of Myth came to an end as Arha and Malik perceived the world they spawned had become consumed by chaos, with little fixed form and endless change wrought by their divine creations. With a gesture, in a moment that was both instantaneous and eternal, they reached out into the world and reshaped reality. 

#### The Embodied Gods

In this extended moment, Arha and Malik created the embodied gods, into whom they imbued some of their Divine energy, the raw power of creation and destruction of their Divine Realm, and tasked them with bringing order to the chaos of the material plane. These Embodied Gods are now known as the Firstborn of the Elder Races: Aldanor and Elmerca, the Living Tree and the Wild Star of the elves; Entamba, the Elder Mountain of the stoneborn; Hazkunde, Bero, Udazkena, and Negu, known as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, the four Tharzen Anzinakoa of the lizardfolk; the Ruler, Runemaster, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, and Farmer, the seven Bahrazel of the dwarves; and Nwana, called the Stranger-Child, Obito, called the Merchant-Musician, and Jemghari, called the Traveler-Storyteller, the two-faced First Ones of the halflings.

  

The Embodied Gods strode into the world of Taelgar, and reshaped it. Striding through the empires of the children of the Divine, they brought form and order to chaotic realms of pure energy. From their steps, the land was formed and reformed: forests grew in the steps of Aldanor; mountains sprung from the footprints of Entamba; rains followed the wanderings of the Tharzen Anzinakoa, as rivers and marshes grew behind them; vast caverns of beauty and light grew from the hammers of the Bahrazel, and the First Ones followed, weaving stories and memories of the world as it changed. In this new world, all manner of beasts and living things emerged from the divine purpose of Arha and Malik, and the desires of the embodied gods, and the magic of the children of the divine.

#### The Three Despairs

The Void mind had been waiting, and watching, and as Arha and Malik shaped the embodied gods and bestowed them with Divine power, the Void mind stole the breath of the Divine, and out of itself spun the Three Despairs: Umidzka, the Empty; G’Zab, the All Consuming; and Jinnik, the Madness. Through these beings -- not quite gods, unable to reach the world, but imbued with the fundamental energy of the Void -- this mind worked against the creations of the Divine, in the shadows, slowly, never revealing its form or alien thoughts, always seeking to undo the works of Arha and Malik, to bring emptiness back to the Void.

#### The Riving

The long pause, the moment out of time during which the Embodied Gods reshaped the world, ended with the Riving. Drawing on the full strength of their endless Divine power, Ahra and Malik sundered the multiverse, ripping the planes apart, making the world round and the land fixed in form, and, some say, spawning an endless number of parallel realities. Before the Riving, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, all the echo realms, were intertwined with the material plane, but at the moment of the Riving the layers were pulled apart and the echo planes separated into their own realms, still resonating and vibrating with the material plane, but no longer part of it.

  

Through this moment of shattering, the Three Despairs tested their power, and embodied their own gods. Out of the union of G’Zab and Umidzka, Thark, the God of War Without End was born. Rumors of other creations of the Despairs persist: the Goddess of the End, the Hopeless One, the offspring of G’Zab and Jinnik; the Endless Chaos, the offspring of Umidzka and Jinnik; the Mad One, the embodied avatar of Jinnik. But whether these creations are real, or merely rumor, even the wisest elves do not know. Some have even speculated that the Three Despairs unleashed embodied curses into the world, attributing the curse of undeath and necromancy to Umidzka, and the curse of lycanthropy to Jinnik. 

  

Diminished in power as the boundaries around the material plane grew thicker and the influx of magic to the world of Taelgar grew weaker, many of the children of the divine fled, or were banished, in this instant. Scholars and loremasters have long sought to catalog and understand the full story of this exodus. While much is not known, most loremasters agree that the archfey and their spawn followed the dreams and shadows into the echo realms, the Feywild and the Shadowfell; and the elder elementals and their creations fled to the Elemental Planes that were the source of their energy and power. Where the great wyrms and titans went, and whether indeed all left the material plane, is a subject of great debate. 

  

As the multiverse was sundering in the Riving, the realms of the embodied gods spun from the Plane of Souls and their imaginations, where the form of the land could still be reshaped with a thought. 

## The Second Age: The Age of Creation

As the Age of Myth ended, and the world was changed, the lands of Taelgar stood empty, only the small remnants of the great empires of the children of the divine that managed to survive the riving remaining. In the moment of the Riving, the embodied gods created the Elder Races. First, the elves, followed by the stoneborn, the lizardfolk, the dwarves, and finally the halflings.

  

The Age of Creation -- reckoned as the second age of the world by the elves, and the beginning of the count of years by the dwarves -- was a time when the Elder Races grew to dominate the landscape. They walked the land, built great civilizations, created, and lived, and died, their souls going to join their creators. The realms of the Firstborn, and the world of Taelgar, filled with life.

### The Elder Empires

During the first millenia of the Age of Creation, the great empires and homelands of the Elder races grew into their power and magic. 

  

The elves, while never very numerous, possessed great wisdom, exceptionally long lifespans, and a powerful command of magic. These traits made the elves the undisputed ruler of the age, and they founded two great empires. In the north, the kingdom of Alcarinquë grew to stretch from the forests south of ~CentralMountains~ to the Mostreve Hills and the Cymean foothills. In the south, the kingdom of Tinwerquë spread from sea to sea in the tropical and subtropical forests south of the great savannahs of the interior. 

  

The stoneborn, even less numerous than elves, and always reclusive, do not figure greatly in the stories that remain from these times. As always, the stoneborn hid away in their barren retreats, in the high peaks, the frozen north, and the depths of deserts. However, legends of great masters of art and craft, trained by the Stoneborn, demonstrate the mark they still made on the world. 

  

The lizardfolk remained largely in their homelands, in the vast coastal swamps of the southern [[Green Sea]], stretching from north of what is now the great desert all the way to the Sembaran lowlands.

  

The dwarves grew quickly after they awoke under the ~CentralMountains~, and began to build great halls, delving deeper underground. During the Age of Creation, the dwarves were little seen to the outside world, as their underground kingdoms slowly grew to span the entire ~CentralMountains~. By the end of the Age, they were beginning to stretch out, moving to new mountains in the east and west and north, beginning to excavate and build again. 

  

The halflings, always wanderers, spread across the [[Green Sea]], and along the coasts, although from where, originally, they came, lore does not say, and the halflings themselves do not share. While they traveled everywhere, they remained most prevalent along the shores of the [[Green Sea]], along the southeast coast of the continent, and across the great plains of the interior.

  

From the distant south, little is recorded, even by elven historians, but scholars doubt it was empty and barren. Still, through the long unchanging years of the Age of Creation, the Elder races remained constant, their empires growing but not evolving or changing. 

### The Origin of Orcs

In secret, while the Elder empires grew, the Void mind was still at work. In the far corners of the world, the embodied god Thark saw the creation of the Firstborn and sought to emulate it. From him, the orcs were born, the best known of the races of Despair. Slaves to the compulsion of Thark, orcs saw nothing but war and violence, although rumors persist of orcs and orc tribes who renounced Thark and lived free. The orcs, created in small numbers in the distant corners of the world, where they would not be noticed, grew quickly and died quickly, and for many long years were not noticed by the Elder races. 

  

Whether orcs were Thark’s only work, or whether more creatures of violence were birthed from secret embodied gods is not recorded in the annals of the loremasters. 

## The Third Age

And yet, Arha and Malik were not satisfied. After millenia, the world of Taelgar was static. While no longer ever changing and full of the chaotic energy of the intermingled planes, in the balance of chaos and order, the pendulum had swung too far. The embodied gods had put too much of themselves into their creations, and year after year followed like clockwork.

### The Creation of Humans

So Arha and Malik created one last thing: the humans. To give them time to grow, they raised a great land in the [[Endless Ocean]] to be their homeland, which became known as Hkar. At first, little changed, although in the reckoning of elven scholars, the creation of humans -- the final great act of Creation by the gods in the world of Taelgar -- marks the end of the Age of Creation, and the beginning of the third age of the world.

  

Arha and Malik breathed something new into humans that would change the history of Taelgar dramatically: the power of divine belief. Elven scholars and theologians have debated for centuries the nature of the divine spark gifted to humanity, and how these powerful Incorporeal gods were able to arise from belief alone. But despite long centuries of thought and debate, knowledge of the birth of incorporeal gods remains the ineffable mystery of Ahra and Malik. No one can say for sure how new gods are born, or how old gods fade away, and exactly how the essence of humanity generates the divine magic in the world. 

  

As humans spread across Hkar, aware of the divine presence in everything but without the names of gods to worship -- for Arha and Malik did not answer their prayers or manifest themselves in the world for humans to see -- the first human religions began to take shape, and the first Incorporeal Gods came into being.

### The Last Despairs

As the new race of humans spread across Hkar, the Three Despairs acted one final time. As Arha and Malik stepped in to the world to give the divine spark to humans, the Void Mind and its unchildren trickled in to Taelgar. As they did so, the Void Mind began to pick at the scabs of the tear in the multiverse from the Riving. Over time, these tears widened to cracks, and the alien terrors of the Far Realm began to leak through. Deep underground, far below the kingdoms of the dwarves, eldritch horrors began to gather from these alien realms.

  

Meanwhile, the Three Despairs, out of the mold of the humans, breathed to life a new race, the goblinoids, a race of people that would have no god, that would see no Divine, that would forsake the divine spark of humans. These were a diverse people of many forms, not fixed in form by divine will like the elder races, or created with only superficial variety like the humans. But among the various goblinoids, it was the hobgoblins -- intelligent, organized, and cunning in battle -- that came to dominate their kin, the small and sneaky goblins and the strong but lazy bugbears. The hobgoblins were few to begin with, and grew slowly, but implacably they began to see themselves as the rightful inheritors of the world, the pinnacle of Taelgar, the only beings not to depend on the crutch of a Creator God.

### Premonitions

As humans came into the world, and the Void Mind and the Three Despairs acted one last time, many of those of the Elder races felt the change in the world. The elves, sensitive to the shifts in the ages, heard the warnings of Elmerca, a great premonition that a new force, something evil, was growing in the world. Some turned their backs on these warnings, but many began to prepare, building defenses and strongholds against the shadows to come; some elves even turned from their kingdoms and sailed to Hkar, to help teach and prepare humanity. These elves eventually lost some of their elf-ness, and became known as the Peronar. While the elven empires grew to untold heights during the ~Third Age~, for many even the greatest heights of the elven empires were touched with the knowledge of what was to come.

  

Among the dwarves, the premontions of evil lurking the deeps led to a great schism. Many counseled that the dwarven flee their underground halls, seal the doors and great halls with the might of their magic, and turn their backs on the lives of the ancestors, seeking a new way aboveground. Others refused, arguing that they could not abandon the homes of the Bahrazel, the homes of their ancestors, and that they must stay and fight. This schism led to the Great Sundering of the Dwarves, with those who left the mountains heading east, and eventually settling in the high deserts in the very center of the continent, calling themselves the gnomes.

  

Little is recorded in human histories of the impact of the turning of the age on other Elder races, although many speculate that at least the lizardfolk, now known as bringers of prophecy and omen, must have seen something of the history to come.

### The First Generations on Hkar

For a millenia, the early generations of humans lived on Hkar, and spread out across the land as they began to build the rituals of birth, growth, adulthood, and death that make up life. Few cities existed at this time, as humans were still scarce, and were still inventing society. But the land was bountiful, disease rare, and humanity spread like wildfire.

This was a time of rich belief. In the first, early days after the Creation of Humanity, humanity was tinged with the afterglow of the Divine, the people and the land of Hkar having newly sprung from the essence of Ahra and Malik. Still echoing with the Divine magic of their creation, the divine spark, the essence of humanity that empowers their belief to bring Incorporeal Gods into being, was particularly strong. In the first generations after the Creation, as the humans prayed to their creators, and received no answers, the idea of intercession began to develop. Humans began to realize the truth, that Ahra and Malik will not answer them, and that their creators will speak to them only through intermediaries.

This belief, and the prayers and curses of the earliest humans created the primordial gods -- the first intercessory gods, given life on the extraplanar realms of Celestia, Arborea, the Abyss, and the Nine Hells, in order to bring the prayers, curses, fears, and hopes of humanity back to the Divine Presence. While little comes down today of the worship practices of these early traditions, the gods of these realms are primordial, the divine embodiment of the raw power of these early human cultures.
### Early Exploration

After many generations on Hkar, humanity began first tentative ventures out across the ocean. These early sailors discovered the mainland, encountering the Elder races for the first time. Over the next four hundred years, the first wave of human migrants departed Hkar. Even the elven scholars who witnessed these first migrations are no longer sure of what drove people to leave their homeland: what is an attraction and desire to interact with other races, a desire for space and open land, or some kind of cultural split on Hkar itself? 

#### The Northern Migrations

The first slow trickle of migrants arrived and settled in the shadow of Alcarinquë, in what is now the coast of western Dunmar. These people, the Northerners, began to move north into land that was largely empty, on the far western shore of the continent, beyond the borders of the empires of the Elder races. Living in small villages and family groups, often in the shadow and protection of elves or other Elder races, this first wave of emigration brought with it from Hkar a set of languages, the Northros tongues, and religious tradition, the Northern Folk Religions. 

  

Over the next thousand or more years, this culture spread northward along the coast into the cold lands of the Far North, and then east across the mountains, to cold plains of ~KenkuHomeland~ and the highlands of Vostok and Sembara, as far east as the Mostreve Hills, developing diverse languages and religious traditions, almost entirely in isolation from other humans. These people did not build large cities or great empires, never grew large and numerous, and mostly lived their lives in small villages and towns, on the edges of the Elder empires. Only those who eventually settled the island chains of ~IslandChain~ retained some contact and trade with their former homeland of Hkar. 

#### The Southern Migrations

Within a few generations of the Northerners leaving, another, larger mass migration left Hkar, the second, bigger peak of the first wave of emigration. These people are known as the Southerners, and they spread along the coastlines to the south and east of Hkar, moving inland over generations across the main equatorial and south equatorial regions of the continent.

  

The peak of this second early wave of migration was a time of flux on Hkar. A new religious tradition was developing, and the earliest primordial gods were beginning to give way to pantheons, sets of powerful Incorporeal Gods with distinct personalities and the power to control much of the world directly, removing the need for intercessory prayers. As the power of these gods grew, Arha and Malik increasingly become perceived as distant overgods, with little role to play in everyday life. What religious beliefs the southern emigrants held, and whether they brought with them the intercessory traditions of the earliest humans, the emerging pantheon, or some other as of yet unmentioned tradition, is not recorded by the sages.

### The Height of Hkar

Over the next many generations, life on Hkar continued. While those on Hkar largely lost touch with the Northerners, regular trade from the port cities of the east connected the people who emigrated south. As the population on Hkar grew, the eastern portion of the small continent became increasingly urban, and began to rely more and more heavily on magic to ensure sufficient food, water, and sanitation in the large cities of the Hkaran east coast. To the west, on the rocky, rough coastline and mountains of the western portion of Hkar, a mariner culture developed, less urban and more focused on the ocean and exploration.

  

At this time, the pantheonic traditions of worship solidified, and among different cities and populations a few pantheonic traditions began to dominate, worshipping Incorporeal Gods who act in the world on their own, without recourse to Ahra and Malik. While initially a number of diverse pantheons, each often associated with a particular city or region, co-exist, over time one, known as Mos Numena, the worship of the Eight Divines, came to dominate.

  

Whether because of the growing dominance of Mos Numena and its city-states, the increasing population pressure on the island, or something else, in this period the second great migration from Hkar began.

#### The Mariner Exodus 

The western mariners left first. This important mariner culture, largely on the far western coast of Hkar, had been exploring the [[Endless Ocean]], wandering far and wide across the trackless seas, and worshipping their own pantheon of gods. While the details of this ancient mariner religion have been lost to time, many scholars speculate that the ~OceanGod~ of the Skaer Islands was once part of this pantheon, but the rest of the gods of these ancient people have faded away over the millenia. 

  

When they discovered a vast land, far to the west, with a enormous inner sea, they felt called home, and emigrated there in great numbers. They begin to settle on the east coast of the mainland and the eastern end of the [[Green Sea]], where there are relatively few of the Elder races, and no people. 

  

As the mariners spread around the [[Green Sea]], some began to follow a new religious tradition, ~ArhaMalikMeditation~, which preached the primacy of the true gods Arha and Malik, and the importance of meditation practice for reaching them directly. The spread of this new religion caused a schism. Not all of the mariners forsook their old gods, and those who held to the traditional ways sailed west. 

  

As the remnant of the mariners spread into the western [[Green Sea]], some settled on the Skaer islands. Over the long years, the Skaer traditions empowered the ~OceanGod~, and gradually, the rest of the pantheon was forgotten. From here came the ~SkaerReligion~, still practiced among the Skaer islands. Others settled on the coastlines around the Western Gulf, and as their villages moved up the great river valleys of the region, they met the Northerners, their long sundered brethren. The northern folk traditions mixed with pantheonic ideas of the mariners, and a new religion was born, worshipping the local spirits called the Kestavo. 

#### The Slow Emigration 

While the mariner culture left Hkar en mass, during this period of later Hkaran history numerous smaller groups also departed for the mainland. Many of these minor exoduses from Hkar left no descendants to the current day, as their cultures and people were lost to chance and time. But some survived, the most important of which for scholars of the current age are the Dunmari, a small group of emigrants who worshipped a close-knit pantheon of gods, the five Divine Siblings, the children of Ahra and Malik. The early proto-Dunmari settled initially around the northern edge of the desert, in the savanna and semi-arid grasslands, and developed a pastoral culture that emphasized horsemanship. 

#### The State of Human Cultures Before the Downfall

More two millennia after being created on Hkar, humanity had finally spread far and wide. Around this time, five major groups of humanity exist:

  

- On Hkar, a relatively unified culture, with an urban, magical orientation largely worshipping the Eight Divines. This is the vast majority of humanity still.
    
- Around the eastern [[Green Sea]], an ‘eastern’ culture, with a significant seafarer element to their culture. These people, settling in empty land, have a more urban culture than most other mainland humans, and small kingdoms and other political units have developed. They are the second most numerous group of humans.
    

- The eastern culture has two strands, based on a religious split. One strand, the “neo-easterners”, are followers of a new philosophical-religious tradition, which holds that through meditation and practice humanity can access the divine spark directly. The other strand, the “old eastenders”, follow the traditional mariner pantheon of their culture on Hkar. The “neo-easterners” are significantly larger and more widespread than the “old easterners”
    

- On the main continent, spread along the tropical western coast and the equatorial interior, a ‘southern’ culture, the third largest group of humanity, but by a relatively narrow margin behind the easterners. They maintain trade and cultural connections with Hkar.
    
- On the main continent, spread along the temperate west coast, and the central interior and far north, a ‘northern’ culture, with a unique religion based around many small intercessory spirits and semi-divine great heroes. Living almost entirely in the shadow of the Elder race empires, except perhaps on some islands in the [[Endless Ocean]] west of the coast. These people are noticeably less numerous, and more widely spread, than either the Southerners or Easterners.
    
- Across the central plains of the main continent, the proto-Dunmari, with their own unique language and pantheonic religion. They are the smallest group of humanity by a significant margin.
    

  

In a few places, even before the downfall, these cultures were already mixing:

- In the highlands of Sembara and Vostok and the Far North, on the eastern slopes and highlands of the ~CentralMountains~,  the ‘northern’ and ‘eastern’ cultures have encountered each other, and a blended ‘eastern northern’ culture has arisen, with its own religious tradition.
    
- On the central plains and deserts of the main continent, a bit of a melting pot culture with elements of the easterners, southerners, and proto-Dunmari exists, but this region has a very low population density.
    
- Similarly, on the east coast, the Easterners and Southerns are meeting and blending a bit.
    

### The Downfall of Hkar

 %%comment
  basic idea here is that during the third age, the northwest of Taelgar is kind of a backwater, and certainly the land beyond the mountains is very backwater. the real center of everything is the tropics, basically from what is now northern dunmar through the southern green sea and then south to the equator.  
  
then, during the downfall, that region is what suffers the most, outside of Hkar. so what is left is people on the fringes. this orients drankor north. if there is a 'southern drankor', it would be very far south, beyond the current world map.
%%

The ~ThirdAge~ ended in fire and cataclysmic, as the allies, servants, and slaves of the Three Despairs burst into the world in conflict and war. Although this war touched all the land of Taelgar, the greatest fighting was on the central coasts of the western shore, in the land that was southern heart of the great Elven kingdom of Alcarinquë, and further south to the northern edges of Tinwerquë. A great host sailed for Hkar, striking at the heart of the human world, where they overwhelmed the defenses of the Hkarans. As last, desperate act, Arha and Malik sank the land of Hkar, and great destruction followed. Many humans died, but so too did many more hobgoblins, orcs, and horrors of the deeps. While the ~GreatWarI~ was not a total victory for the humans, elves, and allies, it was not a defeat, and despite enormous loss, the spawn of the Despairs were diminished, never to recover completely to their former strength. 

  

With the sinking of Hkar, the land changed: mountains arose from the plains, hills turned into seas, desserts blossomed and forests withered. Even the land itself was shattered. New oceans cut through what had once been fertile land in the south, breaking the continent in two. In the chaos, little of the south survived, and the great elven kingdom of Tinwerquë sank beneath the waves. Old oceans also retreated, and the great swamps of the lizardfolk on the shores of the [[Green Sea]] dried up as the plains turned to desert and the water retreated. While some settled in fragmented remains of the great wetlands of old, others fled to seek a new home. What became of them is not recorded in the north. Even the dwarven kingdoms were not spared, despite their fortifications. The horrors of the underdark claimed many deep halls, and many dwarfs retreated to the surface, living in aboveground cities.

  

Among the humans, the destruction was greatest on Hkar. Many refugees from Hkar, buoyed by the Eight Divines, landed in the war-torn remnants of the dying elven kingdom of Alcarinquë. Whether others survived the long journey south, beyond the destruction, to some far distant land, is not known by modern scholars. But those living on the mainland were not spared the ravages of war. The cities and civilizations of the south, once the most powerful kingdoms outside of Drankor, fell, and were swallowed by the changing land. Only those humans who had lived on the margins of the world, in the far north, or on the shores of the [[Green Sea]], escaped largely unscathed, although not untouched by war. 

  

Thus, at the end of the ~ThirdAge~, all was changed, the elder races diminished, and the time of the humans at hand. 

## The Fourth Age

As the Fourth Age began, the world was a different place. The victories and sacrifices of the ~GreatWarI~ had not been in vain, and the many allies of the Despairs were forced to the margins of the world, but much had been lost in the war and chaos that followed.

### The Aftermath

The downfall of Hkar was a massive disaster. A continent sized place sank, and the main continent was sundered into a north and south half. Among other changes, this disaster dried up the central plains, which become a great desert, and created the Sea of Storms, a magically cursed area where navigation is difficult, extending east and north from where the continent of Hkar sank. When the wreckage clears after a generation or two, the following cultures exist:

  

- Hkar is gone, but the bulk of the survivors have established Drankor which is spreading to the north and west into the fertile and empty lands that were formerly occupied by great Elder race empires. 
    
- The southern culture has been devastated by the sundering of the north and south continents, and has splintered into three groups
    

- The ‘south continent’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which emerged on the southern continent and merged with Hkaran refugees
    
- The ‘south islander’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which rebuilt a culture in the newly formed seas, bays, and islands along the (new) south coast, as well as the western coast along the Sea of Storms, south of the desert.
    
- The ‘south mainland’ cultures (undeveloped for now), which forms in the interior of the southern part of the north continent; these cultures have some eastern influences on the east coast.
    

- The northern and eastern cultures largely survive intact
    
- The proto-Dunmari largely settle on the arid fringes of the great desert, stretching mostly along the north edge of the desert in the savannas and grasslands there.
    
- A new, unique desert culture emerges, with some proto-Dunmari, some southern, and some eastern influence, as well as a strong influence of the gnomes, who shelter these people during the worst of the Downfall years.
    

  

Among non-human cultures:

- The great elven kingdoms are gone, save for some remnants of the ancient forests in the ~Irebor River Valley~ and south and east of the Mostreve HIlls. Most elves who survive the downfall retreated the western forests, or the remnants of Alcarinquë near the [[Green Sea]], now called [[Orenlas]] (loosely, “dawn leaves”). 
    
- The lizardfolk scatter, some staying in the remnants of the great swamps of the prior age, others finding new refuges in the changed world, and many leaving on a great migration to find a new homeland to the south. 
    
- The dwarven kingdoms, especially those of the ~CentralMountains~ retreat from their deepest depths and fortify the dark passages of the underdark, far below the surface, against the evils that still lurk in the shadows. Many dwarves found new cities above ground, and look to growing human kingdoms as trading partners. 
    

  
  

### The Drankorian Empire

  

Early in the Fourth Age, many survivors of Hkar founded the city of Drankor on the Mahar river, near the coast of what is now called the Sea of Storms. The story of the northwestern corner of Taelgar during the Fourth Age is, in many ways the story of the growth, decline, and fall of the Drankorian Empire, and the aftermath of its history. 

#### Founding

The City of Drankor is founded in the year 4133, only 11 years after the Downfall of Hkar. Although initially a small settlement in a fertile river valley, it quickly attracts refugees who have landed along the coast of the Sea of Storms, and by 4180 Drankor is a city proper, recreating as best possible the grand urban centers of Hkar, and the people of Drankor have begun to spread north, east, and west, settling and farming the fertile grasslands and remnant woodlands of what was, before the Downfall, a great forest and elven kingdom. Fires swept across most of the land, burning the trees, but the rains were plentiful and the soil fertile, so new life sprung back rapidly in this land. 

  

By 4300 or so, the nascent Drankorian Empire stretches along the coast of the Sea of Storms, as far east as the shores of ~GreatBay~, as far west as the Nevos Sea, and north into the empty expanses of the land that is now Dunmar. Many in Drankor, only a few generations removed from the days of Hkar, turn east and south, trying to reclaim old trading connections. But the Sea of Storms was chaotic to navigate, the mountainous lands to the east the home of hobgoblins and worse, and the lands to the south torn by upheaval and destruction, desertification and flooding. So, the Drankorian Empire turned its sights north.

#### The Culture of Drankor

As Drankor grew into a major power, then great empire, a few aspects of its culture stood out. 

  

- Magic was absolutely central to Drankorian culture. The Drankorians didn’t draw strong divisions among types of magic: to them, it is all just the manipulation of extraplanar energy. Whether that is the Void via a Divine intermediary, the Plane of Magic, or the Feywild through a Archfey intermediary is of only secondary importance.
    
- Drankor, founded in the aftermath of perhaps the greatest supernatural catastrophe humankind had ever experienced, was deeply, deeply concerned with learning as much as possible about the secrets of the multiverse, and protecting its people from supernatural danger. While the strength of Drankorian magic meant that few, if any, extant human cultures could present an existential threat to the empire (they lost wars, but pretty much only when overextended on the frontier), supernatural dangers -- dragons, giants, undead, fiends, etc -- could still present real danger.
    
- Drankor was a culture of communities -- societies, secret and not, orders, guilds, and clubs, all these kinds of factions and affiliations were very common across all of Drankorian society. 
    

  

#### Expansion

Over the next 100 years, the Drankorian Empire expanded north and west, to the Myrenai Gap in the west and the southern reaches of the ~Irebor~ river valley in the north. Most of this land was empty, fertile territory, left unpopulated after the fall of Alcarinquë. During this time, most of Drankor’s attention was focused on the eastern borders, where a series of defensive fortifications are constructed between the ~EastBranchMahar~ and the ~GreatBay~, to provide defense against incursions from the survivors of the Armies of Despair that fought during the Downfall Wars. On the northern frontiers, more than 1000 miles from Drankor and the center of the Empire, contact and trade with the northern peoples, both east and west of the ~CentralMountains~, slowly began to grow.

  

The first war the Drankorian Empire fought was against the hobgoblins of the ~EasternMountains~, a short decisive victory, and a key moment in the self image of the nascent empire. The decisive turning point in this war was the deployment of mages, both human and Peronar, and from this conflict the use of war magic becomes a major focus of the Drankorians. 

  

However, despite a clear victory, the Drankorians did not seek to expand east. The land beyond the mountains was barren and empty, rugged unpopulated wastelands unsuitable for farming, and even the shores of the [[Green Sea]] were largely empty. The nomadic Dunmari and other desert people traveled through this land occasionally, but the civilization growing in the coastal lands abandoned by the lizardfolk at the end of the ~ThirdAge~ is more than 1000 miles away, and the Drankorians did not push far into the wastes of ~NAME~. 

#### Assimilation of the Western [[Green Sea]]

  

By 4400, the Drankorian Empire is firmly established in the lands that are now Dunmar, with fortified borders to the west, along the Myrenai Gap, and the east, along the ~NAME Mountains~. Over the next 150 years, Drankor fully comes into its own as by far the dominant power on the continent, and expands -- largely by assimilation and relatively non-violent conquest -- north along the ~Irebor River Valley~ into the western [[Green Sea]]. By 4550, Drankor has pushed north to the Volta, and east to the coasts of the [[Green Sea]], save for the fey-protected land of Tyrwingha, a few small highland kingdoms in the foothills of the ~CentralMountains~, and the forests and swamps of the Elven and Lizardfolk kingdoms. 

  

As the Drankorian Empire spread, its institutions spread as well. Most prominent was Mos Numena, the religion of the Eight Divines that was central to Drankorian worship. While in some parts of the [[Green Sea]] the worship practice of the Mos Numena changed to fit local customs, the power of the Eight Divines was undeniable, and many converted, even those not directly under Drankorian rule. The organized practice of magic also spread with Drankorian expansion. Drankorian society was both highly magical and full of membership groups, many devoted to the study of magic, both divine and arcane

  

~note added from working on timeline: this is a good point for a new emperor with a focus on . 

#### Non-Drankorian Cultures 

During the years of the expansion of the Drankorian empire, the other human cultures were not static:

  

- The ‘east northerner’ culture of the western [[Green Sea]] is almost entirely assimilated into Drankor, with only some remnants in the highlands and in particular in the highlands of Vostok.
    
- Further east, on the shores of the [[Green Sea]], the influence of Drankor is felt, but is not dominate. 
    

- In the islands and the north coast of the [[green sea]], the people are trading and interacting with the Drankorian empire but never significantly under threat of conquest. These people develop into the ~NorthCoast~, ~Skaer~, and ~GreenSeaIsland~ cultures, and especially in the far east and north retain the original Hkaran mariner cultures.
    
- Along the south coast of the [[green sea]], beyond the ~Drankor Frontier Mountains~, trade begins to increase considerably as the Drankorian Empire settles the shores of the [[Green Sea]]. While the Empire never conquerors the land to the east, and never becomes a major maritime power, trade and the spread of institutions, especially Mos Numena, is a major influence on the development of the south coast cultures. 
    
- The proto-Dunmari, a small and relatively isolated/culturally unique group, are of course aware of the existence of a great empire to the west, but remain aloof to its cultural influence.
    

- The ‘mainland’ southern culture, south and east of the desert, as well as the southern island cultures, remain far distant from Drankor itself, but the east coast and the western islands, in particular, has a bit of a “Europe” relationship with Drankor’s “China”, as long distance trade flows along the south coast of the [[Green Sea]] and across the desert from the urbanized empires of the east to the heartland of the Drankorian Empire. 
    
- The south continent cultures are left undeveloped but totally outside the Drankorian sphere of influence
    

  

#### Western Wars

After several hundred years of peace, a new expansionist regime takes control in Drankor, looking to the west coast. Although the Myraeni Gap, between the ~Central Mountains~ and the ~Coast Mountains~ was and is rough and hard land, beyond the fertile coastal plains tempt the Drankorian emperors. In 4712, the Drankorian armies march west, and in three short years quickly cross the Yerahd and reach the coast, fortifying the banks of the Nahadi. Over the next decade, a series of bitter campaigns slowly drive the Northerners north, beyond Lake Valandros, and into the depths of the ~Great Forest~, and the Drankorians conqueror the fertile coastal plains north of the Nahadi. 

  

The Northerners who live south of Lake Valandros  are to a large extent forcibly assimilated; the small gods of the ancient Northlander tradition are hunted down and driven extinct, and the people who won’t convert to Mos Numera, or submit to Drankorian rule, were exiled or slaughtered. 

  

--EDIT LINE--

  

- The assimilated Northerners, further north in the lands north of the lake but south and inland of the ~NorthernBay~, develop a culture with a mix of Drankorian and Northern elements. In most of this region, the worship of the Eight Divines displaces pre-existing religions. 
    
- The exiled Northerners form two major branches, who retain their ancestral religious traditions.
    

- Many of those that fled Drankorian rule fled west to the islands, which is already one of the more urbanized population centers of the northern culture
    
- Others fled north into the marginal lands along the Northern Bay and further north. 
    

### The Fall of Drankor

  

Then, Drankor falls, and the first plague devastates the central core of the Drankorian Empire, and causes much political turmoil across the empire. While the geographic changes associated with this plague are not nearly as great as those associated with the downfall of Hkar or the death of Cha’mutte, some significant impacts develop. First, the area around the mouth of the ~DrankorRiver~ is cursed and haunted, and the Sea of Storms intensifies, making the coastal route south difficult/impossible for regular trade, and isolating the south coastal people. Second, shifts in winds and rain and currents promote desertification on the northern edge of the great desert, driving the Dunmari north and west.

### The Rise of Cha’mutte

  

In the 500 years between the fall of Drankor and the Great War, the following developments occur:

  

- In the west:
    

- Chardon grows as a city state with significant influence over the hinterlands of the former empire. Some small tributary kingdoms and other city-states grow up, but this region (the mainland around Chardon, excluding the Nevos Bay islands and the peninsula) is very Drankorian in culture.
    
- Many small independent kingdoms develop between the northern edge of Chardon’s influence and the far north. Many of the more southern of these kingdoms are strongly Drankorian in culture, but towards the north some have more northlander influences.
    
- In the Far North, Cha’mutte’s base in Pandar grows and begins to exert influence over the more purely northern inland cultures.
    
- The islands and coastal cultures remain
    

- In the [[Green Sea]]
    

- Development of Sembara, Vostok, Cymea, etc; plus ~Irebor~ and ~South Cymea~ with a more Drankorian (Cymea-like) culture
    

- Dumari migration
    

- Dunmari migrate northwest, conquering and settling the Drankorian plains
    
- Also some move more north and east, and settle/conquer/assimilate/blend with the “non-Drankorian, central/easterner culture on the [[green sea]] coast north of the desert
    

- In south and far east, fall of Drankor has less influence and things proceed as during the empire, with modest changes in trade, communication, etc as a big vacuum is left in the west.
    

### The Great War

  

Then, the Great War strikes. The Dunmari are devasted, and ~Irebor~ is essentially entirely wiped out. The northern kingdom south of Pandar and north of the Great Lake are also essentially wiped out, more or less eliminating from the world the Drankor/northerner blend culture (what survives tot he south is more pure Drankorian, what survives on the coast/islands and far north is more pure Northerner). 

## The Fifth Age: The Age of Rebirth

~fifth age, current, just mentioned in passing here~

### The Blood Years

### Rebirth and Regrowth

  

In the current day, you have the following human cultures:

  

- Broadly, the “Drankorian” cultures, who follow Mos Numena:
    

- In Greater Sembara, the Drankorian/”east northlander” blended culture
    
- In Cymea, ~SouthCymea~, Chardon, a more pure Drankorian culture
    

- Broadly, the Dunmari cultures, who follow the Divine Siblings:
    

- In Dunmar, the Dunmari themselves, a pure Dunmari culture that settled conquered land after the fall of Drankor
    
- In “EasternDunmar” on the south shore of the [[Green Sea]], a more blended culture, Dunmari in religion but with Drankorian, eastern, and desert influences
    

- Broadly, the northern cultures, who follow the Northern Religion:
    

- The islands to the west of Chardon; the only northern group with significant population in the modern day
    
- The coastal people of the northern bay 
    
- The scattered people of the Far North
    

- Broadly, the eastern cultures who follow the Eastern Religion:
    

- These are generally pretty unified across the north and the central/eastern islands
    
- The Skaer are somewhat different/unique
    

- Broadly, the southern cultures, including the southern continent, left undeveloped, but with many strands: south coastal/island people, south continent people with Hkaran influence
    
- A few blended or unique cultures:
    

- Myraeni, who live in the Myraeni gap between Chardon and Dunmar and north on the slopes of the central mountains, an ancient people of mysterious origin
    
- The Illorians, a mixing pot culture of refugees and others from a variety of cultures in the west, perhaps a pluralistic societies in Taelgar without a dominant religion
    
- The peninsula west of Chardon, possibly just a part of the Chardonian empire or possibly a current homeland of Peronar/half-elves, still following ancient Hkaran traditions of blended cities with humans
    
- The desert people, a blend of non-Drankorian people living in the desert for the past 1000+ years, probably have their own unique pantheonic religion.
    
- The east coast, south of the eastern islands and east of the mountains, stretching south into the subtropics, who are probably an ancient civilization, founded around or even before Drankor but still surviving, representing a mix of Eastern and Southern cultures. However probably don’t have their own religion, instead follow either Eastern or Southern tradition, or perhaps another pluralistic place with no dominant religion.
