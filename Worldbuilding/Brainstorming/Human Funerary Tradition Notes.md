Human funeral traditions are somewhat varied, but are all rooted in a metaphysical truth that when a human dies their soul fades quickly from the Plane of Consciousness, but does not immediately disappear into nothingness, nor immediately gain everlasting life in some outer realm.

  

Instead, most souls drift towards the Land of the Dead, a mysterious realm with many different names and descriptions. From the Land of the Dead, many souls find their way to some outer realm, of a god, or perhaps the Nine Hells or Arborea or stranger realms. Those not claimed by a god, or similar power, eventually fade away into nothingness, becoming part of the essence of the place itself. This journey across the Land of the Dead is usually thought to take about a week, although some cross it faster, or slower, and souls that are lost can linger much longer, it is thought. What happens to those souls who never leave the Land of the Dead is a mystery, although many theories persist: some believe they fade away; others believe they are stuck forever, in a kind of limbo. 

  

There is also an ancient H’karan idea, dating back to the first creation of humans, that these transitions, and in particular the transition of the soul from the Plane of Consciousness to a body at birth, and from Taelgar to the Land of the Dead at death, are minor miracles, granted by the gods to each human born.

#### Drankor

The funerary traditions of Drankor are a useful starting point, as all Mos Numena cultures inherit many of the Drankorian ideas. In Drankor, the funeral rites were very much focused on the journey through the Land of the Dead. The miracle of death, the transition from the Plane of Consciousness to the Land of the Dead was taken for granted, as the right due from the gods to every human, and it was little celebrated or acknowledged.

  

Instead, for ten days, elaborate (such as one could afford) prayers and rituals were performed to guide the soul to the appropriate final realm. The locus of these rituals was the body, which was elaborately embalmed and prepared. This was a time for mourning, and often extravagant signs of grief were displayed, including, for the wealthy, by professional mourners. It was believed that these human rituals could help guide the soul on its journey, and without them, the soul would be lost in the Land of the Dead forever.

It would make sense for temple architecture to take this into account, to have space where bodies could be held awaiting burial, for display and mourning. Could also be a major source of funding for temples in Drankor.

The focus was on the human ritual, however, and in many cases the ultimate destination of the soul was seen as something that could be chosen or guided by the priesthood, with the right invocations, sacrifices, and magic. Drankorian tradition included elaborate descriptions of the outer realms, often from supposed visitors, and wills of some might include requests for which realm they wished to go to upon their death.

I don't really like this, actually, I think that the ultimate destination of a soul is really about that soul and the divine presence, about Arhat and Malik even more than any individual "god". Rituals and prayers help in a sense, but magic can only do so much. I think, instead, it might make sense for the Drankorian rituals and prayers to be about the speed of the journey. I think in many cultures, and especially Mos Numena, would see the Land of the Dead as a necessary evil, a dangerous place the soul needs to survive. A lost soul, unprotected, is vulnerable to curses, to demons, to whatever flaws the person who died had. The Mos Numena are not the personal protectors of their people, they are more like archetypal forces, and so it is up to the loved ones of the dead to protect the soul on its journey. This is also why the Dunmari traditions are very different -- they trust the gods to be their personal saviours in a way that is not really part of the Mos Numena tradition.

I like this -- the rituals are more to speed the soul on its way. That fits better in a lot of ways, and makes it easier to leave the destination ambiguous.

I think that the outer realms of the gods themselves would still be a lot more mysterious than this. The elemental planes, the "primordial outer realms" like the Nine Hells, Arborea, etc, many of the echo realms, the land of the dead, would all have stories about them, but travel to the actual realm of the gods would likely be very, very difficult and it would be little-known even by Drankor what is there.

Sure, that makes sense. Keeping the destination mysterious and vague is pretty easy and simplifies some of the cultural storytelling as it doesn't have to be aligned with some metaphysical truths.  
  
That is to say, the only truths people on Taelgar would really know are:  
* there is a real place called the Land of the Dead  
* souls are real things that go to this place, and journey through it  
* souls have a destination, thought to be a place of eternal life  
* not all souls make it to the destination  
* the gods / human activity does have some impact on which and how souls cross the land of the dead  
* the precise impact  is immeasurable.

After the ten days of ritual, the soul was seen as unconnected from the material plane and no longer tied to the body in any way. A variety of traditions grew up around the body. For the poor or the unsentimental, cremation was the default choice. But memory and remembrances are an important part of the Mos Numena tradition, and for some, the locus of memory was an elaborate crypt or funerary marker. 

  

What was true about the Drankorian tradition? I think all of it. It seems plausible that in fact the rituals of the priesthood could indeed help guide a soul through the Land of the Dead, and the Drankorians seem like they would have enough magic to ultimately have in fact visited many of the outer planes. The impacts on resurrection would be well understood, and you could even imagine some minor spells that could not resurrect someone, but could tell you where their soul was. I can see a wealthy widow in Drankor paying a priest to cast a spell to ensure their dead spouse really was in the right outer realm. The other aspect that is not fully true, I would imagine, is that in reality, the process of guiding a soul through the Land of the Dead is probably mysterious and inexact, and of course therefore the rituals are neither fully necessary nor fully able to control what happens. At the same time, I think unguided souls probably do get lost in the Land of the Dead a lot more often than those for whom some kind of funerary tradition is performed. So the exact nature of the funeral isn’t critical, but those who die without any sort of funeral really are more likely to be lost in some fashion.

  

What happens when bodies are lost? I think the Drankorian tradition would mostly move on. The body is the locus of the soul, yes, and an important part of the ritual, but all is not lost when the body is lost. The rituals would go on, without the body, and although perhaps some risks would be associated with these rituals, and so recovering bodies would be seen as somewhat important where possible.

  

A picture of a Drankorian funeral:

When someone dies, the body is taken to the temple to be prepared, and the counting of days starts, with specific rites on each day after death. After the final rites are performed, the burial occurs, but this is highly cultural and depends on wealth, status, etc. There would be public offices to say the correct rites for those who die with no one else, but these would be basic. There wouldn’t really be a tradition of a public funeral, instead there would be a variety of social traditions that develop as part of the 10 days of rites that happen after death. When the date of death is unknown or a body is discovered well after death (or a person is lost and presumed dead, but the body is never found), there would be a variety of special rites to say, and prayers for those who are missing in action but never found, that would be seen as protected the soul in the face of uncertainty (although wealthy families who could afford divination magic would typically use that). There may be a tradition of death masks or similar to provide a locus for lost dead, especially in cases where the dead are lost at sea or something so known to be dead but the bodies cannot be recovered. I think it would come to be seen that the crucial thing is to complete the rites, and while it is better to start them the day of death, anytime you start them is much better than not doing them at all. There would probably be special rites to anchor a lost soul that would begin any funeral period for someone whose body was lost or died some time ago. 

  

#### Kestavo

In the Kestavo tradition, the most important guide of the soul to its final home was not the priesthood or humans, but instead, the kestavo themselves. These small gods were not seen as keepers of heavenly kingdoms, but instead guides, and the journey of the soul through the Land of Dead was mediated fundamentally by the kestavo. Additionally, it was seen as the job of the kestavo to both guide the soul to the Land of the Dead, and from the Land of the Dead.

  

In order to facilitate this, the body would be buried in a sacred spot, where the kestavo could easily find the soul, which was seen to be lingering near the body. The kestavo would then guide the soul into, through, and out of the Land of the Dead to the final resting place. The ultimate destination of these souls was imagined differently in different regions: for some, 

  

I imagine the outer planes in kestavo tradition are much vaguer than in the Drankorian tradition, and perhaps even the kestavo don’t fully know where the souls go. The kestavo vision of the afterlife probably needs some refinement.

  

From a funeral perspective however, this leads to a rapid burial in a sacred place, often with grave tokens blessed by the kestavo, to help the guide find the soul. Usually the body would be buried within a day, and then a tradition of communal observance and mourning over the following ten nights developed. This was seen almost as keeping a vigil for the soul and would often be focused on remembrances and stories of the dead, to help keep their soul burning bright for the kestavo guide. After the burial, however, the priesthood would have almost no involvement in the funerary traditions, except as part of the community.

  

The ten days of the journey is less remarked on in kestavo tradition, and seen as less critical, perhaps because resurrection magic would be extremely rare compared to in other places. I think the northerners wouldn’t necessarily see that something specific and magical happens after ten days, and a body buried on the eleventh day (because, for example, the person died at war and the body took time to be brought home) wouldn’t be seen as totally lost. But the longer since death the body was buried, the more important it would be to have strong connections to the kestavo, as the soul gets harder and harder to find, and more and more likely is lost wandering on Taelgar or the Land of the Dead.

  

What was true about the Kestavo tradition? I think it makes sense that the kestavo really do guide the souls of their small folks to some outer plane, and that stories about the soul really do help the kestavo. I can imagine a lot of this guide being quite literal, where the kestavo is manifested in the Land of the Dead, listens to the stories, and uses the information they get by listening to the mortals talk about the dead soul to direct its next steps. The kestavo view of the ten days and the soul getting harder to find is probably also true. A soul lost wandering in the Land of the Dead doesn’t fade at exactly ten days, although it does get harder to find them. The kestavo really do probably also help prevent ghosts and other mishaps, but even without them most humans probably make their way to the Land of the Dead. 

  

What happens if the body is lost? In the kestavo tradition, this is a disaster, almost like a second death. I imagine great efforts would be undertaken to recover bodies, and things like drowning would be seen as particularly horrible ways to die. The soul, lost in a strange place, has no guide. However, some traditions did evolve around trying to bring a kestavo to the soul. So for example several of the large lakes in the north have kestavo spirits strongly associated with them, as do some of the larger mountains. A body drowned in the lake could of course be found by the kestavo of the lake. I could imagine myths and stories of how some hero coaxed a kestavo to move into some lake after her husband drowned, as a way to ensure he had a guide to the afterlife.

  

This would also suggest that a very significant punishment would be being executed and left unburied, although perhaps the fear of creating a ghost would mean that sort of thing would be seen as too dangerous to the community to ever use as punishment.

%%comment
yeah I think this would be seen as a particularly **evil** punishment, because it both condemns the soul and risks the community. so this is more like the evil warlord slaughters and entire village and leaves them unburied, hoping to desecrate the land and make it impossible for anyone who fled to return because of ghosts
%%

#### Sembara

The Sembaran tradition is a blend of the kestavo and Drankorian traditions, but also with some uniquely Sembaran evolutions of the Drankorian tradition. The heavy focus on the priesthood as ritual mediators and the primacy of human action is not a Sembaran cultural trait the way it is in Drankor, and so the although the ten days of ritual stays, the Sembaran culture emphasizes this as a time for the gods to choose, rather than humans to guide, where the soul goes.

  

So the Sembaran funeral tradition begins with preparing the body, usually embalming it, and a series of prayers and rituals to invite the divines to open a door for the soul into their realm. For the next ten days, the soul is on a journey towards this open door. This journey is often seen as dangerous, and although there are both ritual activities and private grief during this period, no public funerary events take place until ten days have passed. The most important ritual is during the first day after death, to guide the transition into the Land of the Dead. The rest of the ritual experience during the ten-day is largely about supporting those still living through their grief and the added challenges of having to wait for the soul to make this transition through the Land of the Dead. But these religious events are seen as private, and often between the grievers and the gods, directly.

%%comment
This should probably be true for all Mos Numena traditions

This would also be the crucial ritual to perform for lost bodies, missing in action, etc, with variations depending on the certainty of death.
%%
  

Burial in the churchyard is seen as helping the soul on its journey, and so often the burial takes place, quietly and with few mourners during the ten-day, and then the funerary rite and remembrance of the dead takes place at the grave site, but not as part of the burial itself, after the ten days have passed.

  

Rarely, during the ten-day, signs or portents from the gods will hint that a certain unexpected god is guiding the soul, and usually that indicates the burial should be in a place consecrated to that god, if at all possible.

  

What is real? The gods really do have to let souls into their realms, a soul cannot force its way. But the Sembaran superstition that the wrong activities will disrupt the soul’s journey during the ten day journey is mostly just that, a superstition. But in some metaphysical way, the attention of the living is a key component of reducing the danger of the journey, so in a way, the superstition is real, in the sense that if everyone just pretended like the journey wasn’t happening, it would in fact make it harder for souls to make it to the outer realms.

  

What about missing bodies? The Sembaran view is somewhat of a balance between the kestavo tradition and the Drankorian tradition. The burial of the body in consecrated ground is certainly desirable, but there isn’t the same sense as there is within the kestavo that without a connection to a physical locus of the god, the soul is likely to be lost. The Sembaran tradition is somewhat, I imagine, like the Christian tradition. Burial in a churchyard is good, but also new holy spaces for burial can be created relatively easily, and the gods are fairly ubiquitous, so it isn’t like a battlefield on the edge of the Plaguelands is out of reach of the eight, and it could certainly be consecrated and made holy for the burial of those who died in battle.

#### Chardon

The Chardonian tradition is a more direct descendant of the Drankorian tradition, and never gained the emphasis on burial as a way to connect the soul to the gods. Mos Numena, after Drankor fell, did evolve in both Chardon and Sembara to be less about the humans and more about the gods -- so Chardon shares some of the Sembaran beliefs that the ten-day rituals are more about giving the gods an opportunity to open the door. But also, Sembara doesn’t have the same ‘single patron god’ idea as Sembara, so whereas in Sembara the actual actions of the god is not seen as very important (in that it is usually expected that the patron of the community will be the one overseeing the soul, even if it is guiding the soul to some other god’s realm), in Chardon, much more emphasis is placed on interpreting signs and portents about where the soul has gone and which god is helping the soul on its journey.

  

But other than the shift in emphasis, the actual Chardonian traditions are largely the same as the Drankorian ones -- a period of public and ritual mourning for ten days, while the body lies at rest, and then cremation for most bodies, and crypts or other elaborate memorials for others.

  

The Chardonian tradition emphasizes the need for the gods to hear the rituals, and emphasizes simplicity in the preparation of the body. Signs and symbols and adornments distract the gods, in the same way gods can hear prayers most clearly when a single god is prayed to at a time.

%%comment
The intention here is to contrast with the Mawar tradition of grave goods/tokens to set up the fight Wazir had in Chardon. Him wanted desperately to include grave goods with his son's burial, the Chardonians believing that would keep the gods from finding his soul.

%%

#### Mawar

The Mawar tradition shares with the Sembaran tradition an emphasis, from the old northern ideas of the small gods, of a personal guide. But in the Mawar tradition it is the ancestors and demi-god saints who guide the dead to the afterlife. A largely Chardonian tradition exists, in terms of the rituals and activities that occur, except that the expectation is that the body will be buried with tokens of demi-gods/ancestors, before the 10-day ends, and the ritual period takes place without the body as the focus.

  

What is important in Mawar tradition however, are the tokens, not really the burial, and so it is often the case that for example sailors, or warriors going into battle will bring/wear several tokens on their bodies, in case they die lost at sea or whatever.

  

#### Dunmar

  

Funerals have some aspects of both private and communal rites. The private goodbye, the farewell to the body, is a family ceremony that involves the cremation of the dead, happens soon after death and is a private rite; in part this is practice, due to the difficulty of being able to return to a temple immediately. But the real funeral, the farewell to the soul, takes place later, at a temple, and is usually a communal affair, where many souls are welcomed into the halls of the gods at once. 

  

In the Dunmari tradition, the first rite of death, the farewell to the body, must take place as soon after death as is practical. This rite is the private goodbye, the time of mourning and sorrow to say farewell to the dead as they embark on their journey to the Afterlife. Bodies are burned in funeral pyres, often with small tokens to help them on their journey, especially things that remind the soul of the good they did in life, or remind them of the gods. Sometimes the small icons of the Dunmari gods that most Dunmari carry are burned as well. If a person had a particular vice that might keep their spirit from leaving for the Land of the Dead, this may also be burned, usually placed at the bodies’ feet, to remove the temptation to stay. Usually the ashes from cremation are scattered before 10 days have passed, but sometimes they are kept and interred in temple crypts during the second rite.

  

The second rite of death happens later, often much later, as part of a communal ceremony. There is no strict time limit, but it must happen at least 10 days after death, and usually happens within a year of death. This is a ritual carried out in a temple, where candles are lit for each soul being celebrated, and the colors of the flames are interpreted as indicating the final disposition of the soul. This communal funeral is usually followed by a celebratory feast honoring the dead. As part of the ceremony, small mementos of each dead soul are often created as a way for those close to the dead person to keep the memory of their soul near (not sure about this).  

  

In the Dunmari tradition, the first rite of death is what helps the soul get to the Land of the Dead, but once there, the Dunmari gods will guide them, and the Dunmari typically trust to the gods and don’t believe that human intervention is necessary to ensure a soul makes the journey. 

  

Unburied bodies, therefore, are a concern primarily because the soul may still be tied to the Material Plane, and have not actually made it to the Land of the Dead. Dunmari groups, such as the Order of the Awakened Soul, that have made it their mission to seek out the unburied dead do so primarily to ensure that no lost souls are stuck, wandering in Taelgar, unable to leave; this is especially so because it is believed that traumatic deaths are more likely to keep a soul stuck and unable to reach the Land of the Dead.

%%comment
I think the distinction here would be that the Mos Numena traditions would have rites, to be said by priests, that would be seen as guiding the soul to the Land of the Dead; the Northern Folk Religions and Dunmari traditions instead see the disposition of the body as the crucial step to guide the soul to the Land of the Dead  
  
In most cultures, while the disposition of souls would be important, a wandering soul lost in the land of the dead is much less of a problem for the community than an angry ghost.   
  
So while the 10-day journey and various related traditions would be significant, the strongest taboos would be associated with the things that are seen to prevent ghosts and haunting (in Dunmar, burning bodies/the first rite of death, in Northern traditions the guidance of kestavo/ancestors, in Mos Numena traditions the prayers of a priest)

Comments on Raise Dead:
I like a lot of this, I think that for worldbuilding purposes it makes sense to relax a bit the strict 10-day timeline. Most cultures would have some traditions/prayers/additional rituals to help souls of people who died unknown get back on track, so to speak, and metaphysically what happens to souls of people who don't get the proper rites at the proper time would be a little unclear. Some clearly fade away to nothing, at some point, but not all; some probably make the journey on their own, without guidance; some may just be lost and need extra attention to recover and find their way back.

Right. That actually has some interesting implications for resurrection. An adventurer who strongly wishes to be resurrected can try to stay in the land of the dead for longer. And a contented soul might pass through in 2 days and no longer be able to be resurrected at all.   
  
Leads to some risk around Raise Dead, sometimes it just doesn't work after 2 days. And other times, it still works after 3 months.  
  
That feels more metaphysically appropriate than trying to stick with an "exact" 10 day timeline, and it provides some flexibility in the cultural traditions as well.  
  
I was trying to stick to the 10 days as I thought you cared about it being somewhat precise :)  
  
But it does make some of the traditions awkward.

I actually think this could be really interesting. The spell Raise Dead can bring a soul from the Land of the Dead back to their body, but how intact does the soul need to be? Obviously if it has passed on to the eternal realms you need stronger magic, but if it is just lost/faded a bit, maybe with the proper rituals you could reconnect the soul to the body and bring it back even after a year has passed. But really any time you cast Raise Dead, it is always a risk and there is never any guarantee it will work. Revivify always works because this snaps your soul back into your body before it has even faded from the Plane of Consciousness, and something like Resurrection/True Resurrection has the power to potentially find your soul anywhere. Actually fits really well with how I want resurrection to feel in Taelgar -- basically, Revivify is a freebie / defibrillation type emergency medicine, Raise Dead is the main way the dead can be brought back but it depends very heavily on circumstance that is beyond the caster's control, and Resurrection/True Resurrection is really really rare because almost nobody can cast 7th+ level spells. So the great stories/myths about coming back from the dead would typically be about Raise Dead and it would all be a little shrouded in mystery/uncertainty, like sometimes it just fails and no one knows why. So while combat resurrection can be feasible and relied on, you can't build empires around counting on Raise Dead to work.
