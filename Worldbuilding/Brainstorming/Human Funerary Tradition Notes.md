#### Chardon

The Chardonian tradition is a more direct descendant of the Drankorian tradition, and never gained the emphasis on burial as a way to connect the soul to the gods. Mos Numena, after Drankor fell, did evolve in both Chardon and Sembara to be less about the humans and more about the gods -- so Chardon shares some of the Sembaran beliefs that the ten-day rituals are more about giving the gods an opportunity to open the door. But also, Sembara doesn’t have the same ‘single patron god’ idea as Sembara, so whereas in Sembara the actual actions of the god is not seen as very important (in that it is usually expected that the patron of the community will be the one overseeing the soul, even if it is guiding the soul to some other god’s realm), in Chardon, much more emphasis is placed on interpreting signs and portents about where the soul has gone and which god is helping the soul on its journey.

  

But other than the shift in emphasis, the actual Chardonian traditions are largely the same as the Drankorian ones -- a period of public and ritual mourning for ten days, while the body lies at rest, and then cremation for most bodies, and crypts or other elaborate memorials for others.

  

The Chardonian tradition emphasizes the need for the gods to hear the rituals, and emphasizes simplicity in the preparation of the body. Signs and symbols and adornments distract the gods, in the same way gods can hear prayers most clearly when a single god is prayed to at a time.

The intention here is to contrast with the Mawar tradition of grave goods/tokens to set up the fight Wazir had in Chardon. Him wanted desperately to include grave goods with his son's burial, the Chardonians believing that would keep the gods from finding his soul.

#### Mawar

The Mawar tradition shares with the Sembaran tradition an emphasis, from the old northern ideas of the small gods, of a personal guide. But in the Mawar tradition it is the ancestors and demi-god saints who guide the dead to the afterlife. A largely Chardonian tradition exists, in terms of the rituals and activities that occur, except that the expectation is that the body will be buried with tokens of demi-gods/ancestors, before the 10-day ends, and the ritual period takes place without the body as the focus.

What is important in Mawar tradition however, are the tokens, not really the burial, and so it is often the case that for example sailors, or warriors going into battle will bring/wear several tokens on their bodies, in case they die lost at sea or whatever.
