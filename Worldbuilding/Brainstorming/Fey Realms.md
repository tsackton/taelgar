### **126. Cruxis**

(_Midnight, Everything Balances on the Edge of Existence_) **The Equilibrium King**  
A land where every action requires an equal and opposite reaction. To take a step forward, something must step back; to breathe in, something else must exhale; to live, something must die.

### **127. Everloft**

(_Early Afternoon, The Ground Floats in Pieces Like Islands in a Clouded Abyss_) **The Wind-Drinker**  
A skybound realm where solid ground exists only in scattered fragments. Gravity shifts based on belief—one falls only if they remember they should.

### **128. Parable**

(_Twilight, Where the World Only Exists as Story_) **The Archivist Without Hands**  
A realm where every person, place, and event is inscribed in a vast, unreadable tome. To speak aloud is to alter the script—every change in wording reshapes the world, but the Archivist ensures no revisions are undone.

### **129. Slivershade**

(_Dusk, The Sun is a Thousand Shattered Pieces Suspended in the Sky_) **Count Irith, the Broken Radiance**  
A landscape cut into razor-thin shards of reality, each reflecting a different version of the land. Walking between shards allows passage between possibilities, but too many crossings blur the traveler’s true self.

### **130. Omenhold**

(_Afternoon, Every Object is an Unfulfilled Prophecy_) **The Augur Queen**  
A land where everything—stones, rivers, trees—whispers its fate before it happens. To pick up a rock is to know the hand that will one day throw it; to touch a door is to glimpse the moment it will open or be broken down.

### **131. Wraithlace**

(_Evening, Shadows Weave into Tangible Threads_) **The Loom-Thief**  
A city spun from shadows, where every movement leaves behind a thread of darkness. To cut one’s own thread grants freedom, but the Loom-Thief gathers all abandoned strands, knitting them into something new.

### **132. Stillborn**

(_Noon, The World is Frozen Until Someone Moves_) **The Waiting Prince**  
A realm where nothing exists until it is observed. The sky remains blank, the trees unshaped—only when a traveler walks do roads form beneath them, only when they reach do doors appear before them.

### **133. Knellsink**

(_Midnight, Bells That Ring in Reverse_) **The Reverse Bishop**  
A drowned land where church bells toll backward, pulling past moments into the present. Those who hear them too many times begin to experience their lives out of order, reliving their past in sudden, spiraling loops.

### **134. Reveris**

(_Afternoon, The Laws of Cause and Effect are Reversed_) **The Moth-Eyed Duchess**  
A place where consequences precede actions—wounds appear before weapons strike, words are heard before lips move. To understand this world, one must live backward before moving forward.

### **135. Yonderglass**

(_Twilight, The Horizon is Always a Window to a Different Place_) **Sir Elthor, the Horizon-Walker**  
A landscape where every distant view is a glimpse of another world entirely. Travelers who walk toward the horizon never arrive where they expected, but always where they were needed—or feared.

### **136. Feintwell**

(_Evening, A Place Where Nothing is What It Seems—Literally_) **Dame Prevaris, the Truthless**  
A city where every object, person, and sound is a lie given form. A book may open into a door, a cup may hold echoes instead of liquid, a person may be a conversation made flesh.

### **137. Jux**

(_Noon, Where All Things Exist Twice_) **The Overlapping Sovereign**  
A realm where everything has a twin, and both versions exist simultaneously. Travelers will always encounter themselves on the road ahead—but which one is real, and which is the echo?

### **138. Wane**

(_Dusk, The Landscape Fades with Every Step Taken_) **The Hollow Earl**  
A world constantly dissolving—hills erode into mist, rivers vanish behind travelers, even memories grow thinner the longer one remains. The only thing that endures is what has already been lost.

### **139. Gossamer**

(_Midnight, Where Everything is Weightless but Memory is Heavy_) **The Moonless Weaver**  
A place where nothing touches the ground, where people, objects, even thoughts drift aimlessly unless tethered. Those who forget themselves become lost in the currents, floating forever between moments.

### **140. Filigree**

(_Afternoon, A World of Impossible Detail_) **The Artisan Without Hands**  
A land where every surface is covered in intricate patterns, etchings that tell the stories of all things. Even the air carries tiny engravings—inhale too deeply, and one may breathe in someone else’s fate.

## Unnamed

If a name was used but not the description or other details, move here. 

### 1. 

(_Perpetual Golden Afternoon_) **Lady Aneniel, the Keeper of Petals**  
A tranquil land of rolling meadows, blooming eternally under golden light. The scent of flowers carries memories, and those who stay too long find themselves forgetting their own names.

### **18.** 

(_Smoldering Eternal Twilight_) **Count Sable, Lord of Ash**  
A land of fading embers and drifting smoke, where the air tastes of burnt memories. Wishes whispered in the ash become real—but are stolen from another's past.

### **35.**

(_Sunset Turned to Molten Gold_) **Lady Senira, the Weaver of Light**  
A golden valley where liquid amber flows from trees like honey, capturing moments in crystalline form. To break open an amber shard is to witness a past that was—or a future that could be.
## No Archfey

If an archfey was used but not the rest of the realm, move here.
