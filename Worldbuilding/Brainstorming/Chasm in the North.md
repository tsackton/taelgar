Brainstorming ideas from Session 0 for Mike's game

130 miles long / no one knows how deep

river runs through it - but not along the bottom - in runs in a constructed channel that appears to have been made by giants in ancient days, but may have some other entirely different source. maybe 1-2 miles across. 

river exists on the other end - flows through a tunnel and then cascades down a waterfall-ish / rapids to the end

likely it is a portal to the plane of air - if you go down far enough you emerge into a flying island on the plane of air

kenku (?) monastery in the chasm - built on a wall - taken over from something else. 

maybe - a dwarven tunnel ends on the side? from nidzahar

sometimes see spires at the bottom - but not always

wandering illusion fields 

might be other strange creatures living in it - or on the canal

zimkovans think it is the source of the evil west wind (kestavo)

weird planar crossroads deep in the depths of the chasm?
