**## Green Sea Worldbuilding Notes
  

Aim is to develop Sembara/Tollen perspectives on the Green Sea, and flesh out the flow of goods, traders, and information around the Green Sea network. 

  

Broken into four major regions: Western Gulf; Western Green Sea; Gulf of <MTP>; Eastern Green Sea

  

Western Gulf is pretty developed already; Western Green Sea and Gulf of <MTP> are less developed, but would be broadly speaking known in some vague sense to Tollenders, Sembarans, etc. Eastern Green Sea has bits and pieces from one-shot developed, but would largely be unknown to Tollenders, with only some garbled rumors of mysterious lands with exotic goods out East. The trade routes are almost entirely mediated through <MTP>, itself a foreign culture, or halflings, whose exotic tales are not always to be believed. The conceptually model here is that <MTP> is “India” to the Western Gulf’s “Europe”, and the lands out east are the Spice Islands/China before Marco Polo. Any facts made up about these places in the context of Tollen/Sembara can largely be considered rumor and are as likely to be false as true.

  

This means that from a worldbuilding perspective, especially for the purposes of Tollen/Sembara and even Skaer what’s out in the Eastern Green Sea doesn’t matter as much.

  

A note on names: The Green Sea is, I assume, the Drankorian name for the entire large sea, between the <MagicIslands> and the Western Gulf. However, the Green Sea can plausibly have many other names, and various regions should have local names for that particular region of sea. Specifically, the western Green Sea, a few gulfs, and the eastern Green Sea should probably have specific names, although for initial worldbuilding these can be abbreviated/undeveloped. 

  

A note on halflings: Halflings are an important maritime force throughout the Green Sea. However, while they have long-standing and racially based trade privileges across most of the world, they never really negotiate for specific favorable deals or work together to undercut human rivals or anything like that. And of course many halflings are motivated by the journey not the profits so you might have one caravan that keeps going to Ainswick in Sembara not because it is really particular worthwhile but because they really like the fall foliage and want an excuse to see it each year. 

  

Halflings might also have a whiff of unreliability about them. Not that they’d break a deal or just get bored and wander off, but they might be reluctant to commit to orders — either because they want to go where their feet take them or they want to see the goods before the buy. So, say, a Tyrwinghan glassmaker might have a deal with a Tollender factor to make 500 wineglasses each season for a fixed price and might prefer that certainty, even though it might mean they’d have less to sell to the halflings who came through and might sometimes give a better price.  

  

They don't quite fit into typical human paradigms of trade and economics. They aren't just particularly mobile humans - they remember things no one should (racial memory), they speak to each other telepathically, they feel like they are mysterious and different. Not in a creepy or unfriendly way -- they are quite friendly and gregarious. But, maybe you are a glassmaker in Tyrwingha and one day a halfling caravan shows up you've never met and offers you double whatever anyone else is offering, because your great-great-grandfather did a favor for their great-great-grandfather. Or worse, they show up and refuse to buy from you because your great-great-grandfather wronged their great-great-grandfather. From the human perspective it would often just feel like good luck or bad luck. But of course everyone tries to put their thumb on the scales and be friendly and helpful because you don't want your descendants cursing your name for some slight you gave the halflings. And you never know what they are saying to each other because they don't talk out loud, except when they are talking to you. So maybe when they are standing there quietly looking at your wares they are asking all their relatives if you are a good or bad person, and so you give them a deal in case your ancestors wronged them, and you need to balance the scales. It should feel kind of weird for humans to be trading with halflings -- again, not in a bad way, but in a clearly non-human way. But people do it because of all the tales of folks who got rich from some unexpected halfling favor, and because they bring stories and ale and music and you have a great time drinking and eating with them, and because every now and then they'll have something strange and unexpected to sell, and you never know. 

  

But they aren't people you sign a contract with to deliver 500 wineglasses each season. 

  

However, there is always some halfling family interested in a long journey, so they are also the ones who bring distant goods across long distances in the Green Sea. 

### Western Gulf

  

Climate/Winds:

- In the summer, warm winds blow from the Green Sea, bringing heavy rain and muggy air   
    
- In the winter, a high pressure system develops over the northern plateau, and the winds come from the west over the ~CentralMountains~. This is a cold and dry season.
    
- The Green Sea, in the east, provides a moderating influence, especially on the coastal plains.
    
- In general, the region’s climate is temperate, with four distinct seasons, dry winters, and wet summers. During the summer months, a monsoon wind blows from the Green Sea, bringing ample rainfall. In winter, high pressure builds over the northern steppe, and the west winds that blow over the mountains are dry and cold
    

  

Major regions/civilizations: Sembara, western Cymea, Tollen, Tyrwingha, and several Lizardfolk communities (Ozabl Swamp and currently unnamed Lizardfolk area between Tyrwingha and Cymea).

  

Major oceanic features: Straits of Cymea, the bay by the mouth of the Volta, and the islands of that bay; the Tyrwinghan river delta

  

Major maritime power: Tollen

  

The Western Gulf is dominated by Tollender ships plying back and forth save for the stormiest winter months. Trade is mostly grain and wool from Sembara, wine, tin and copper from Tyrwingha, in exchange for finished products -- dyed clothes and other fine cloth, mostly. Tollen also acquires some metals (iron and steel) from various dwarven settlements in the mountains, mostly via Sembara, but perhaps some via Ardlas or Breva instead. Tollen has a substantial furrier industry as well, but Sembara also acquires furs from its own highlands and the northern highland kingdoms, so there is less demand (although not none) for Tollender furs in Sembara. 

Both Tollen and Sembara have substantial gold (Tollen and Sembara) and silver (Sembara) resources, so there is also a fair amount of trade in bullion - Sembaran silver flowing into Tollen in exchange for fine goods, and Tollen gold flowing into Sembara in exchange for grain. The balance of payments is actually probably about equal.

### Western Green Sea

  

Climate/Winds:

- Winds generally blow west to east in the winter/spring, and shift (probably only partially in some places) to east to west in the summer/fall. 
    
- In the northern part of the Western Green Sea, along the Vostok coast, influenced by many of the same factors as the Western Gulf, so similar weather patterns, with a wet summer and cold, dry winter. As you get further north, the summers get shorter and occasional winter storms bring heavy snow, particularly when moisture from the ocean meets cold mountain air from the ~Vostok Mountains~. 
    
- The Skaer islands might have a climate similar to northern Japan, perhaps with slightly cooler summers. Lots of snow in the winter, but the ocean probably rarely, if ever, freezes. 
    
- The coastline east to Ursk has snowy winters and mild summers, perhaps similar to the Baltic coast of Russia/Latvia/etc. The ocean keeps things relatively mild but westerlies blowing across the Green Sea dump considerable snow on the coast in winter. Inland Ursk has bitterly cold winters and short summers. Harbors here may occasionally freeze when bitter cold air shifts down (polar-vortex-like phenomenon). 
    
- Cymea, surrounded by water, has a generally mild oceanic climate, with even rainfall year round (or perhaps with moderately wet summers and moderately dry winters), and relatively little snow in the winter. Maybe kind of like France, or the eastern US, trending warmer as you go south, perhaps with a bit of a Mediterranean climate to the south, as in the summer the high pressure zone moves over South Cymea and brings dryer weather. 
    

  

Major regions/civilizations: Cymea, Vostok, Skaerhem (aka Skaegenland, which is the Sembaran name for the homeland of the Skaer/Skaegish), Ursk, northern part of South Cymea, <Lorighos> (big island off coast of South Cymea). 

  

Notes: Irrla is probably more generally part of the <Gulf of MTP> ecosystem than the Western Green Sea and will be discussed there. South Cymea, which is poorly defined, spans both regions; the northern part (up to and including <Lorighos> is considered part of the Western Green Sea while the southern part is considered part of <Gulf of MTP>. 

  

Major maritime powers: Tollen, Skaer

  

Major oceanic features: the Cymean islands (<Lorighos> plus four other major ones); the straits between <Lorighos> and the other islands; the sea/region between <Lorighos> and Irrla

  

The Western Green Sea was once dominated by Cymean traders and merchants, the crossing point for goods passing west to Isingue and on to Chardon. Cymea, despite a lack of unified political organization, saw itself as the heir of Drankor, and profited off ancient magic, enviable climate, and a beneficial position to control trade. However, in the aftermath of the Great War, the destruction of Isingue, and the Blood Years, squabbling among petty princes and a disorganized response to economic shocks left Cymea vulnerable and weak. 

  

(Cymea has lots of agricultural wealth still, and magic, and grand old Drankorian ruins/buildings/cities, and lots of history, but also a very clear sense – to outsiders at least – as being past its prime, and a place that has little ability to project power or influence across the Green Sea)

Into the void of the fall of Cymean influence in the past ~150 years comes Tollender ships. Sometime Tollen claims control of the Straits of Cymea (perhaps in the name of fighting piracy), and now Tollen vessels sail out through the Straits of Cymea and trade along both the Cymean and Vostok coasts. Cymean wine, jewelry, and cotton is popular, and Cymea welcomes Tollender furs and clothes -- but Cymean itself has few large merchant houses and few ocean-going vessels. Trade from Cymean to Isingue and west to Chardon has obviously vanished since the Great War, and Cymea has not developed a mariner culture to challenge the halflings or Tollender dominance of the waves. From Vostok, Tollender traders buy many products of the north, including furs, wax, honey as well as iron, tin, and copper. 

On the north coast, Tollender merchant fleets go as far east as Ursk, to buy dragonhide and rare materials used to make the famous Tollen red and green dyes. These fleets usually sail in convoy from Tollen on some schedule that makes sense with the winds, perhaps even overwintering in Ursk or otherwise spending a long time there. Might even typically only sail every other year. 

The Tollender fleets do not really go east of Cymea in the south. Here, you find some influence of the <MTP> mariner culture, one of the two remnants of the old Hkaran mariners in the Western Green Sea (the other being the Skaer). The <MTP> are more sailors than merchants, and,  perhaps something about the passage between Irrla and the Cymean islands is tricky and only halflings know the way, or something else. 

In the north, the Skaer are a deeply oceanic culture, but also a very insular culture, with a distinctive language and religion not shared with anyone else in the Western Green Sea. They do not send large trade fleets in any direction, but do exert strong control over their territory and the northern coasts of Vostok. (Need to think about this a bit – what exactly is the role of the Skaer in the modern Green Sea). 

### <Gulf of MTP>

(The Gulf of Arazeja proposed Cymean name. Other options Trafarjo, Ribeirão. Intention is Portugese to align with Cymean flavor. 

  
MTP people themselves have a different name but Cymean name is used in the familiar west. 

  

Climate/Winds:

- In general, the Gulf of Arazeja (not sure I love this name…) has a mild subtropical climate. Topography of the coastline and Irrla probably keeps the waters of the Gulf relatively mild, but perhaps late summer cyclones race through the gap with Irrla, or something like that. MTP itself is probably fairly wet year round, maybe Taiwan-esque in climate. 
    
- Irrla is a bit of a puzzle. I described it to John for Wellby’s one-shot as wet year round, kind of like a warmer England, but in practice it is probably more Mediterranean-ish, with high pressure zone building over Irrla in the summer giving clear, warm days, and winter being much wetter. The ocean probably keeps the coastal areas more evenly wet, whereas the interior is probably dry and hot in the summer (perhaps a little bit like Spain). 
    
- South Cymea probably trends more dry summer - wet winter, as the monsoons are mediated by MTP and the mountains separating MTP from South Cymea. Inland likely fairly dry year round, especially post Great War with influence of Plaguelands. 
    

  

Major regions/civilizations: Southern South Cymea, Eastern Dunmari, Irrla, MTP coastal, MTP inland (lizardfolk?). 

  

Major oceanic features: The sound/bay in South Cymea between the coast and the islands; the inlet/bay at the western most point of the gulf; the MTP peninsula itself; any further definition of Irrla

  

Notes: Irrla has at least two major powers (hobgoblin pirates, Republic of Svolhas) and has room for 2-3 more. Eastern Dunmari not mariners particularly. MTP likely has mariner-descended coastal population and something else inland, perhaps non-human. South Cymea remans a blank. 

  

Major maritime powers: MTP coastal, although Republic of Svolhas is an emerging maritime power.

The Gulf of Arazeja is dominated by the coastal <MTP>, who criss-cross the Gulf (and are likely the dominant maritime power in the region) and who sail along the southern coast as far east as the <MagicIsles>, but who rarely sail north, and who are more of a sailing culture than a merchantile one, and therefore perhaps often crew the ships of Medju and other southern powers. 

Republic of Svolhas has a rapidly expanding navy, in response to the hobgoblin threat on its northern borders, but is not a traditional maritime power. 

Other notes:

  

1. On the Eastern Dunmari - they not a particularly ocean-going culture, and for various reasons should be located in the area just west of the mountains on the western edge of MTP, and perhaps slightly inland. I think they don't need to be developed much at the moment, since the main concern is trade routes and major maritime powers. These should not be the same people as the MTP mariners. 

  

2. I am kind of thinking the same with lizardfolk - I already have the salt lizardfolk in Mawar and would kind of like to keep that a Mawar thing. Although I could change my mind about this. I am thinking about the interior of MTP? We have this as a subtropical (Cwa / Cwb) climate similar to SE USA or SE Brazil, very appropriate for big swamps. The MTP mariner culture could be very strongly coastal. 

  

### Eastern Green Sea

  

Climate/Winds:

- Dominated by shifting winds, with high pressure sitting in the middle of the ocean during the summer (trade winds blowing west to the south, westerlies blowing east to the north), and sitting over Medju/southern deserts in the winter, with winds generally from the west across the whole region. Some additional influence of the monsoon driven by vast interior north heating faster in the summer and cooling faster in the winter, which might reverse the westerlies in the northern summer, so basically winds generally go west -> east in the winter and east -> west in the summer.
    
- The closer you get to the <MagicIsles>, the stranger the winds and the currents are, and the climate is extremely varied across the islands for unclear magical reasons.
    
- Medju to the far south is a coastal desert, with dry hot winters and dry hot summers, broken only by the occasional summer thunderstorm. Heading east, on the other side of the ~Medju Mountains~, you have a much wetter, tropical/subtropical coastal area
    
- FNP, and the vast expand of land east of Ursk, are a little undefined climatically and can probably remain so? These are very far north, though, at similar latitudes as coastal Siberia, Finland, southern tip of S. America. Inevitably have cold winters and short summers. 
    

  

  

Major regions/civilizations: Medju, FNP, ~EastofUrsk~, ~MagicIslands~, ~CoastalTropics~, buts lots undefined. 

  

Maritime powers: Undefined

  

Medju is clearly a major player in this area, likely having grown in power and influence over the past 300-500 years. During the Drankorian era, it was less developed, and perhaps felt like more of a periphery / minor area. The Drankorians would not have needed Medju to get whatever valuable stuff is in the desert or beyond, and major trade routes may have fed through whatever was south of the desert in the Drankorian days, across what is now the Sea of Storms. 

  

Tollenders and Sembarans know little of the Eastern Green Sea. Halfling traders bring exotic goods - spices, perfumes, rare monster parts, unusual or magical gems and herbs and incenses, technological wonders from the desert gnomes, etc to Tollen, Cymean, and less often, Telham and Tyrwingha but outside some garbled rumors of the great spice city of Medju little is known of where these goods come from. These eastern exotics are purchased with Tollen fine clothes, Tyrwinghan glassware, Sembaran furniture and gold and silver, dragonhide and monster parts and arctic wonders from Ursk, ?? from Irrla, ?? from the magic islands, and Cymean wine.

  

Of course some of those ?? from Irrla and the magic islands also makes it west, but broadly the populace mostly sees them all as coming from Medju and the coastal MTP.

  
  

### South Cymea and Region, Some Ideas

  

Geography: CMM = Cymean Mountains near Orenlas stretching east. CMH = the hills that divide eastern and western Cymea. MTPM = mountains that divide the MTP peninsula from the main coastal plain; TE = “Taelgar everglades” a new large swamp stretching from the southern part of the MTPM to the coast (this might have an element of magic to it – a big swamp that ends right at the borders of the desert but that could be kinda cool) 

  

The Drankorian context. In the early days of the Drankorian expansion the western shores of the Green Sea were mostly unpopulated. Before the Downfall, this land was a huge swamp, the ancient domain of the lizardfolk, but with the changes wrought in the world during the Downfall the swamp has dried out. Two main groups of humans live or move into this area in the years after the Downfall:

- the “old east” mariners have an active maritime culture based on the Skaer Islands, the coast of Vostok, and the Cymean peninsula and its near islands, mostly along the shores and river valleys between the northern slopes of CMM and the eastern slopes of CMH.
    
- The “south/east blending” culture starts spreading along the coast from the far east, but not spreading beyond the MTPM
    

  

Additionally, the lizardfolk swamps did not entirely dry out – the large TE is home to a robust lizardfolk population.

  

So then Drankor arrives, and expands. The main coastal plain between CMM and MTPM is empty and fine land to settle, and is rapidly populated with Drankorian grain and cotton farmers with close ties to the Istabor river valley, another rich place of early Drankorian expansion. Drankor never expands north of the Straights of Cymea, or east of the MTPM mountains, and the close ties between the Cymean and Skaegen mariner cultures fade under the continuing weight of Drankorian cultural imperialism.

  

In the days before Drankor’s fall, the region could be divided as follows:

  

- 3 wealthy agricultural provinces of Drankor: one in the Istabor valley (WP1), one in the Mahar river valley (WP2), and one along the coast between CMM and MTPM (WP3), all “near provinces” of the main Drankorian empire and relatively wealthy from significant agricultural resources, especially cotton and grains. 
    

- These provinces include several noteworthy cities including one on the lake by Orenlas (LC), proto-Isingue, one just south of CMM in the bay created by the islands (CBC), one at the headwaters of the Mahar (MC), and one in the long inlet just north of MTPM (MTMC)
    
- These provinces are very very Drankorian, having been created on almost empty lands
    

- 2 poorer provinces - an island province amongst the Cymean islands (IP), centered on the big island, and a more northern province between CMM and the Straights of Cymea (NP).
    

- These provinces maintained a maritime tradition, and great Drankorian ships would sail from their ports with Drankorian mages seeking the odd magical riches of <MagicIsles> and other places in the eastern Green Sea, but there was little proper trade and few merchant houses or anything like that
    
- These places were culturally assimilated to Drankor, and worshipped Mos Numena, but also these are old easterners who became Drankorian, and so there are distinct cultural differences from the folks further south
    

- A MTP culture along the fringes of the MTP, sailors and fisherfolk with good relations with TE just to the south, and cultural ties back east to various eastern settlements, but no major cities themselves, and always tiptoeing around the shadow of Drankor, being careful to be a good neighbor and avoid the fate of say, the various northern tribes in the west that were crushed by Drankor. The lizardfolk probably help somewhat here. There boats are active in the entire Gulf and somewhat back east to whatever is east, but there is not a large mercantile community. These people are mostly substance fishfolk and their shipbuilding technology is not very advanced
    

  

Then comes the fall. Many survivors from Drankor end up in WP3 and WP1. For <mumble mumble> reasons WP2 suffers badly, and by the time the Dunmari come through it is abandoned and the people in WP3 and WP1 won’t go there or try to resettle. 

  

In the years between the fall of Drankor and the Great War, then, you have the following developments:

- WP1 and WP3 become wealthy centers. Isingue becomes a rich agricultural city, and CBC and MTMC become major centers of revived Drankorian culture, although with many squabbles around who is the true heir, and a minor wars and territorial disputes fragment South Cymea. (It is probably not, at least at this point, called South Cymea, but rather two major regions named after the two main cities in WP3 and their constantly shifting hinterlands)
    
- Unlike WP3, WP1 has only one major center of power, and is much more politically stable
    
- LC (the city by Orenlas) stays neutral and develops closely with the elves. It becomes a center of odd magic and magic-craftwork as well as a trade center on the route from the coast to Isingue.
    
- Cotton is big throughout the hinterlands of South Cymea and significant mercantile networks develop, but “South Cymea” has no mariner culture, and although they might own the boats, they don’t sail them. 
    
- The northern provinces become the sailing culture in the region, and “Cymean” (probably at this point, not really the name as they would likely still be using the 2 provincial names) sailors and their boats (as they, unlike MTP, had a much richer technological background) become the major maritime presence in the region
    
- Over time the “Cymean” river valleys become major centers of proto-industry and the clothmaking and cotton processing facilities develop, and by the time of the Great War northern Cymea is as rich and prosperous as WP3
    
- The two Cymean provinces both develop somewhat unique political systems (perhaps something federalist with cities instead of states) and at least for the moment, manage to avoid importing the squabbling from South Cymea
    
- MTP culture learns better shipbuilding technology from Cymea and elsewhere, and starts to grow and expand across the southern Green Sea. Trade networks begin to develop between the east and western gulf, mediated by MTP and Cymea. 
    
- MTMC becomes a major port for MTP as well as South Cymea, through immigration and whatnot, and starts to develop a very different identity from the rest of WP3
    
- The East Dunmari spread into the ruins of WP2 although they mostly stay to themselves and are seen as insignificant by the surrounding powers
    

  

And so, on the eve of the Great War, you have:

- Isingue, a major urban center and leader of a large and prosperous hinterland built on the cotton trade, and the inheritor to a long Drankorian tradition
    
- <South South Cymea>, clustered along the shores of the inlet near MTPM, and some hinterlands along the mountains and coast north, an increasingly vibrant city that has seen a large influx of MTPers with an increasingly eastern focus
    
- <North South Cymea>, spreading from the bay near the Cymean islands south and west, with at least 2 large cities at this point, wealthy but disorganized, still calling parts of itself the Drankorian Empire in some fashion but not unified and with minor internal conflicts between cities not unheard of. Minimal maritime tradition but wealthy cotton barons own large trading fleets crewed by north Cymeans.
    
- Cymea itself, broadly divided into two areas: the river valleys north of CMM, now proto-industrial and growing wealthy on fabric weaving and perhaps some other things (metals, trade with elves, etc). The island half of Cymea might have a different name and is the even more sailor based part. Somewhat unified political culture although (a) no unification between the two provinces and (b) no kings or governors or single rulers over the whole territory
    
- A self-assured and growing <MTP> culture along the shorelines of MTP with strong cultural ties back east and a growing trade network to Sembara
    
- The East Dunmari to the south of <South South Cymea>, largely ignored
    
- <LC> the city by Orenlas, thriving in its mysterious magical way
    

  

Then the Great War comes and swallows Isingue whole, and with it the entire cotton economy of the region. Some small scale cotton production survives nearer the coast, but a lot of the technology for efficiently processing cotton is lost (without something like a cotton gin, large scale production of cotton is very labor intensive) and on top of that, <mumble mumble> kills a lot of the people in the hinterlands of the entire region, as the lands that are not well defended or near the coast fall to <mumble>. Perhaps most of the various South Cymean legions were in Isginue when it fell. Etc. 

  

So when the dust of the Blood Years clears, you have, from north to south:

  

- The Cymean peninsula and its great cities have lost their major industry and suddenly find themselves unable to fend off a resurgent Tollen for mastery of the seas. Prosperity makes cooperation easy and hardship makes it hard, so some of the interesting unified political systems have cracked, and squabbling over the remains is not uncommon. Plus refugees from the south have come and at least one Cymean city has taken on a “heir to the heir to the heir to the throne of Drankor: vibe, perhaps at least in part inspired by immigrants from the most Drankorian looking places in south Cymea
    
- The Cymean islands suffered less economic shocks but a more direct military one as they lost some naval battles to Tollen. Tollen increasingly (like in the western parts of the peninsula itself, which were always a backwater) has established, if not suzerainty, at least a strong presence and perhaps a naval garrison or two. Not sure about the details… but the idea is that the islands have a bit less of the decline and woe vibe as Cymea itself
    
- <North South Cymea> is a wreck, part depopulated and abandoned cities, part small groups clinging to the leftovers, part weird haunted stuff, part well defended country villas that still grow cotton and have become like little cities themselves under absolute monarchs. There is really no overall political organization. The city on the bay survives as a small hub for the cotton industry that does still exist, but it is a bit of a backwater and the Tollender guilds have rebuilt the grandest Drankorian palaces and now occupy them
    
- <South South Cymea> has become the center of MTP culture and is now the capital of the <MTP> shoreline polity that has longstanding historic trade connections and is also increasing pushing its way into the Tollender spheres of influence in the Gulf.
    

- Not sure about this by the way, just looking at the map a bit I wonder if the big MTP city should have grown up at the point of the peninsula. 
    
- Perhaps the big city in the inlet is the focal point of whoever survived the blood years, and has draw refugees from through South Cymea to it, and still sees itself as the final survival of Drankor. In this world maybe the MTP influences have been pushed away a bit (perhaps with some degree of bad blood) and the MTP culture sees itself in tension with SSC
    
- Or alternatively MTP has several trade cities and perhaps even multiple polities, one built around a blend with SSC and the other more uniquely MTP
    

- The TE lizardfolk continue to have good relations with the MTP kingdom, but otherwise are very much background
    
- The East Dunmari are a non-entity and most of  the people in Cymea or more properly don’t even know they exist. They probably do trade somewhat with the MTP people
    
- The <LC> city by Orenlas is lost. People seem to have forgotten about it or whatever. 
    

  
  
  

Dunmar

Move the Dunmari south a bit from where they are labeled on your map -- their land is really the western side of the MTP mountains, especially the headwaters of the river that becomes Mahar, and stretching over some of the marginal BSh land nearby, but not spreading over the mountains to what is labeled "Unknown East" . This is largely canonical as the Dunmari split at the Mahar. 

  
  

MTP Culture

  

The MTP culture stretches along the coast from the inlet / little gulf just west of the MTP mountains all the way to the beginnings of the desert in the east (or to where the lizardfolk swamp borders the ocean, see below), but mostly clinging to the coast, with little interior settlement.

  

Lizardfolk 

I increasingly like th “Everglades of the MTP” (which also displaces the Dunmari unless it was a recent formation) with a big swamp stretching from the MTP Mountains east to the coast (or almost to the coast), but with the lizardfolk very much NOT seafarers even if their swamp ends up along the coast in some places. Maybe it forms a natural barrier between the desert cultures of the farther east and MTP.

  
  
  

Some old notes from the Worldbuilding doc:

The Green Sea stretches from the far east to the middle of the continent. To the west, major features are the Cymean peninsula and the islands north and south, including Skaegenland, as well as the Mostreve hills in southern Sembara, and the <VostokMountains>. In the center and east, major features include a large island centrally located in the middle of the Green Sea, and a large, dense archipelago blocking the mouth of the Green Sea from the Endless Ocean. While the west is densely settled, in the east, along both coasts, most people live close to the ocean: in the north, due to the increasing cold and snow; in the south, the encroaching desert.

  

Population centers in the Western Green Sea include: Greater Sembara, the Cymean peninsula, Greater Vostok (including the Skaer islands), and the center river valley, including <Irebor> and <SouthCymea>.

  

Population centers in the Eastern Gree Sea include: <NorthCoast>, <Big Island>, <EasternDunmari>, <FarNorthPeninsula>, <EntranceIslands>, and <EastCoast>.

The Green Sea forms a rough triangle, with the western point at about 40 degrees North, and the eastern edges stretching from roughly 60 degrees North to roughly 30 degrees North. The Green Sea is split into eastern and western halves, divided by <BigIsland>.

  

In the winter, a zone of high pressure tends to sit over the southernmost parts of the Green Sea (from about 30 N - 35 N), causing light and variable trade winds south of the <BigIsland>, and a dry climate with little precipitation, while strong westerlies blow north of about 35 N. 

  

In the summer, the land to the west heats up and the zone of high pressure shifts polarward. In the western Green Sea, a monsoon wind blows from the east, bringing summer rains to Sembara and Vostok, while in the east, light and variable winds shift northward. In the south, the powerful trade winds blow from the open ocean to the east. 

  

Consequences for trade: sailing east in the northern section of the Green Sea is easy in winter, while sailing west in the southern and western parts are easy in summer. Historically/real world, the distances are kind of on par with the Indian Ocean trade. 

  

In the west, the climate is dominated by the summer monsoons, which brings moisture-laden air and spring/summer rains, getting increasing dry moving south from the Cymean peninsula. 

  

The <BigIsland> has a climate not dissimilar to Japan, with the summer monsoon bringing rain to the southeastern side of the island and the winter westerlies bringing snow to the northwestern side of the island. 

  

The South Coast, from <SouthCymea> all the way east, tends to be dry, with a climate reminiscent of North Africa “between the mountains,” with almost no rain; only <SouthCymea> itself trends towards a humid subtropical climate (perhaps Pampas-like). The exception is the far east, east of the mountains, which is much more influenced by the Endless Ocean than the Green Sea, and has a much wetter and warmer climate influenced by the warm currents and prevailing trade wind of the Endless Ocean. 

  

The climate of the western islands is highly varied, being strongly oceanic and influenced by the Green Sea, the Endless Ocean, and magic. 

  

The North Coast around Skaegenland is heavily maritime, reminiscent of Nova Scotia/Scandinavia, which continues east to the southernmost extend of the North Coast. The northeastern coast, however, is much colder, more reminiscent of eastern Siberia, with long winters and short summers, although the maritime influence moderates the seasonality.**
