The town of Karawa lies in Eastern Dunmar, a week's ride from the wild frontiers of the Nashtkar, the Blasted Plains, as the haunted plains of Drankor are known locally. The region around Karawa is wide open expanses of dry, arid scrublands, broken only by the occasional rocky hill. Karawa itself is sits in the shade of a mesa, around a small, permanent oasis fed by an underground reservoir.  
While the town has only a small permanent population of a few hundred people (mostly farmers, acolytes associated with the Mysteries of Shakun, and tradespeople), once a year the population swells as nomadic herders gather to attend the Festival of Rebirth, marking the rebirth of the Goddess Jeevali and the start of the rainy season.  

The relatively few permanent structures in town are clustered around the small oasis; the largest of these is the imposing structure of the Mystery of Shakun, carved into the cliffs on the south side of town. On the north side of town, a large caravanserai provides a meeting place for travelers. A massive town square, paved with vast tiles of polished sandstone, stands empty much of the year, but fills with shouts of commerce and greeting during the week of the Festival. Beyond, an open expanse lies, where the camps of nomads sprout as the festival crowds gather.

Houses of adobe / mud brick, except a few bigger or more important ones of sandstone  
Colors browns and some ochre  
Lots of awnings of variously colored cloth, lots of horses and goats

## Design Notes

Following: [https://thecollaborativegamer.wordpress.com/towns/a-system-for-creating-fantasy-villages-towns-and-cities/](https://thecollaborativegamer.wordpress.com/towns/a-system-for-creating-fantasy-villages-towns-and-cities/)
   

Theme: Safe
 
This makes sense, this is a oasis and pocket of safety in a dangerous world
 
Memorable feature: relationship with surrounding area
 
Also makes sense: this is a trading crossroads, an oasis, and also a starting point for anyone foolish enough to venture out to into the Nashtkar, the cursed lands

Basic layout:
![[karawa-layout.png]]

Districts:
 
To place: religious, plaza, governing, public amenity

1. (Poor) On the outskirts of town is a large area of temporary structures and slurms, occupied seasonally by the nomadic herders who bring their animals to the market twice a year. Most of these people are barely scraping together a living, and this is a pretty poor area of town, most of the time occupied by a few temporary camps as nomads come into town as part of their circuit of oasis and watering holes.
2. (Trade) Near the temporary settlements in town is the large, distinctive open market. Incongruously large most of the year, and constructed entirely of sandstone, there is space for hundreds of traders selling animals and other goods during the twice-yearly gatherings.
3. (Culture) Adjacent to the market stands the tavern, most of the time a small, local establishment.
4. (Plaza)
5. (Public amenity) In the center of town is a great public well, fed by the underground oasis that comes to the surface here
6. (Governing)
7. (Religious) The mystery cult of Shakun has its oracle here

## Notable Locations

**The Temple of Shakun:** a large, imposing structure carved out of the side of the red standstone mesa on the southern part of town. The temple itself stretches at least partially into the cliff itself, but you have never been in that part of the structure. Non-initiates are only allowed access to a few outbuildings, and to the chapel to Shakun facing the oasis. The chapel is beautiful - polished sandstone floors, and tile mosaics abound - but is a place primarily for prayer and does not seem to hold any secrets. The Mystai of Shakun do, however, sell and barter dusts and powders that are known to possess magical properties. The temple, strangely, seems more weathered and aged than the rock of the mesa itself.
 
**The Oasis**: The central feature of the town is a small oasis. Over the years a marble pool and short wall has been built around it, allowing water to be drawn off for various uses. The reliability and purity of the water here has established Karawa as a waypoint and gathering place for the Dunmari. Palm trees provide shade and shelter and make the oasis square a place where people linger.
 
**The market square:** On the northwestern edge of town, there is a large market square, which stands empty most of the year, filling to capacity only during the large markets after the Festival of Rebirth, at least this is what you've been told. Beyond it, cleared scrublands and pastures serve as a temporary home for hundreds of herders who return for the Festival of Rebirth, or so you've heard.
 
**The Temple of the Five Siblings:** Although the Temple of Shakun is the larger draw in Karawa, a small temple to the Five Siblings stands on the eastern side of town, facing a small public square. The temple itself is plain, but well-maintained.
 
**The Council of Elders**: Standing across a small public square from the Temple of the Five Siblings is a circular, dome shaped building that is the main public building in Karawa. This space serves as the council chambers where the council of elders meets to deliberate, and the square in front is a place for public debate. Judgements are issued here by the council.
 
**The caravanserai:** On the northern outskirts of town stands a caravanserai, a large square building with a open courtyard, rooms for travelers, and space for merchants and animals. This is a center of commence in the village when the market is deserted, and many things can be acquired from Ikram, the proprietor.
 
**The village**: The village itself is mostly small houses of adobe and mud, facing on narrow streets, with shade provided by colorful awnings. A few artisans and scattered shops line the streets facing the caravanserai, including a tea house which you live above, and a blacksmith.
 
**The fields**: To the southeast of town, some small scale agriculture provides a bit of extra food, beyond what the herds can provide and what can be traded with pastoralists passing through. Crops that require little water and lots of heat do best, although the oasis feeds irrigation channels here that allows crops to thrive. Dates and honey are a particular delicacy, being used to make wine and desserts.
