~soulstuff~ in this narrative is the material of the Astral Plane, which forms a gradient from the ~Deep Astral~ which is kind of pure divine creation energy to the "normal" Astral Plane where the "Outer Planes" float, to the Land of the Dead which forms a barrier that prevents the material plane / plane of souls  from impacting the metaverse. The Plane of Souls is the manifestation of the ~soulstuff~ / Astral Plane in proximity to the Material Plane, and the Dreamworld is an echo realm of the plane of souls in a way.
