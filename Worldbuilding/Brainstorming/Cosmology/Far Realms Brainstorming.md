Canonically the Far Realm is plural, as in Far Realms, so there can be many different alien planes and tons of flexibility. The entirety of my Far Realms notes are:Â 
  
Outside the Void itself lie may, stranger things. Alternate realities, bizarre alien gods, whole entire universes without magic, all these things may drift in the infinite expanse where the fabric of the Void thins to nothing. Scholars do not record how entities from the Far Realm are able to travel to Taelgar, and whether those on Taelgar could in turn reach the Far Realm somehow. But it is well known that some alien aberrations, some dark things that lurk in the hidden reaches of the world, are natives of these alien Far Realms, and must have found a way to cross the boundaries of existences.

Beyond the multiverse, in the [[Far Realms]] of alien horror, rumors of Great Old Ones persist, ancient eldritch masters with utterly alien minds, reaching into the world through the holes in the fabric of reality worn by the Void from the sundering of the planes.
