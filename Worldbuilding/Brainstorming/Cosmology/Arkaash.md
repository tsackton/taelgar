Brainstorming notes on possible Dunmari "home of the gods"

- Not “traditional” heaven or hell, rather a bit of a mix, with a soul’s experience of the power and glory of the Five Siblings dependent on how they lived their life. 
    
- Playing with ideas of light/dark, two-sided; the chosen in the light, those not worthy in the dark, but with a way to get to the light, possibly incorporating ideas about reincarnation; maybe distance from the hall of the gods is key distinction?
    
- The “bad side” isn’t a place of torture or punishment, but more purgatory-like, a way to give your soul a path to a better future
    
- Fading would be “giving up”, admitting you had no chance of redemption, and would be seen as the “real hell” 
    
- Incorporate some ‘halls of ancestors’ ideas, a bit of Wakanda spirit plane stuff; the ancestors are part of the larger community of the gods + people, just have moved to the “gods” side of things
    
- A mortal traveler in the realm of the Five Siblings would find what, exactly?
