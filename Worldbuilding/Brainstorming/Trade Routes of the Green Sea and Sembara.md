The breadbasket of Sembara and the merchant houses of Tollen are the twin economic engines of the Western [[Green Sea]].

### Sembaran Trade Goods
Sembara is rich in grain in particular, and [[Heartlands]] generate significant grain surpluses which are traded mostly to Tollen. The region is also known for its cattle, pigs, and fine horses, and a secondary trade in leather is not insignificant. Flax is also grown here and linen cloth manufactured and traded to Tollen.

The [[Braebein]] in the [[Duchy of Arnsbury]] are rich in silver mines and fine marble, although the marble is rarely traded far due to the costs of shipping. In the western parts of Arnsbury, and the highland kingdom of Ardlas, maple syrup is popular as well and some is traded south and east. Much of the silver of the Braebein flows out of Sembara to Tollen.

The highlands, the northlands, and much of the Wistel and Semb river valleys are known for their sheep and wool. Cheimin sheep are especially highly regarded for their fine wool (think Merino wool or alpaca on earth) and the dukes of Cheimin closely guard their flocks.

In the northlands, along the Volta much small scale manufacturing takes place, especially weaving of wool into cloth which travels downriver to Tollen usually in exchange for silver. Several towns in Telham along both the Teft and Volta are known for their terracotta and cermanic housewares, and both the Teft and Volta styles are traded (again, via Tollen) widely in the [[Green Sea]] region.

The Highland Kingdoms, especially Breva and Ardlas trade foodstuffs heavily with the dwarves for gold, steel, and fine metalworking. Timber is also traded downriver, as are furs, honey, and fine wax for candle-making. Much of the foodstuffs comes from Sembara via halfling traders or Tollender merchant houses.

Along the coast, the [[Duchy of Telham]] has a significant amount of fishing, and some profitable coastal salt flats from which a fine sea salt is obtained. Even more salt comes from the royal salt flats in the marshy delta of the Wisford, near [[Ozabal]] Swamp, and the coastlines of the Duchy of Seham. 

Farther south in [[Tyrwingha]], wine is a common export, and the silversmiths of [[Tafolwern]] are well known, as are the glassmakers, but significant trade routes are not common in the region. Tollender merchants have a significant presence in Tafolwern, and Tollen dyed cloth and fine clothes are popular. But outside of the wine industry, which exports a significant number of barrels each year, and a small number of specialized artisians, there are no major traders in Tyrwingha.

From the Duchy of Maseau comes small quantities of pure gold and very high quality iron, from abandoned mines to the south, as well as more significant amounts of salt from several mines in the hills. It is a good cattle ranching region as well, if one can avoid the monsters, although there are no significant exports of cattle products.

The economically significant exports from the Sembaran region are:
* Wheat and other cereal grains
* Wool
* Linen
* Leather
* Silver and some gold, as coinage
* Wine, mostly from Tyrwingha
* Teft and Volta terracotta and ceramic housewares
* Tafolwern worked silver and glassware
* Woolen cloth, mostly from the northlands

Most of these flow to Tollen, although there is also meaningful trade with the Highland Kingdoms, mostly in the form of grain and salt in exchange for gold and fine metal and dwarven weapons. There is also some small scale trade with the Duchy of Maseau where grain is traded for salt, gold, and fine steel. 

Sembaran coinage is all silver, and gold is relatively rare.

### Tollen

Tollen thrives on trade, the clothing industry, shipbuilding and the ability to project sea power, and the financial industry. Outside of a significant gold mine in the nearby hills and a large fishing community, Tollen has few raw materials.
