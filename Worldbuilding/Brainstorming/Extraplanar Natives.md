Brainstorming and background notes on extraplanar natives in Taelgar.

(1) Removed the old "Extraplanar Species" note from the public species directory. At some point -- when someone has the time and desire to tackle species cleanup -- it would be useful to have some in-world lore here, but the old text below does not, to me, add much value:

>[!info] Old Extraplanar Species Text
Natives of the Outer Realms, often called the Children of Creation or Children of Belief are the native inhabitants of the Spiritual Realms.
>
Fiends, including [[Devils]] and [[Demons]] inhabit the [[Nine Hells]] and the [[Abyss]]. 
>
[[Celestials]] typically spring from the divine realms of gods, such as [[Arkaash]] of the [[Five Siblings|Dunmari gods]] or the [[Heart of the Mountain]] of the [[Bahrazel]].
>
The [[Gidari]] are the guardians of the [[Land of the Dead]], the guides that protect the souls of the recently deceased as they await their ultimate fate.

(2) From a metaphysical perspective, it might make sense to separate "Inner Realm" and "Outer Realm" natives. In particular, the natives of the spiritual realms cannot be killed on the material plane side of the Land of the Dead. At best they can be sent back to their native realm. Natives of the elemental planes and especially the feywild do not have this property.
