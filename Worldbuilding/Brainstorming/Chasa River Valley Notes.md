# Overview

For reference - Chardon is at 37 deg N, just about the same as San Francisco, and Arendum is around 40 deg N, about the northern border of California.

The Chasa River valley is rich agricultural land. Kind of Willamette Valley, Burgundy, Central Valley, etc. Climate is mild, a mix of Mediterranean and oceanic (Koppen Cfb/Csb), with wet winters and warm, sunny summers. Lots of wine, especially closer to the coast (Metium is a huge wine producer). Moving further inland the temperatures get hotter in the summer and colder in the winter, but with plenty of rain to support huge forests. The whole broad gentle slope of the mountains to the coastal plain was historically densely forested, although some land has been cleared.

The winters do not get too cold, and there is little snow, supporting temperate evergreen forests / temperate rainforests, dominated by massive trees (e.g. coastal California forests). In the higher elevation slopes of the mountains, this transitions to more conifer-dominated forests, with more snow (going north from the Elderwood you also transition to more conifer forests with more snow, although still not much except at moderate elevations, until you get very far north, beyond the Blackwater Fens).

This is prosperous land, and some of the oldest territory in the Chardonian Empire, having been completely decimated by wars during the early part of the Blood Years and resettled by Chardonians.

Population here is largely Chardonian, with some people of mixed ancestry who resettled from destroyed cities and settlements. The economy is highly agrarian, and this is one of the two major "bread baskets" of Chardon (the other being the coastal plains west of Lake Valandros). While there is plenty wheat/grain, this is also where you see vineyards, fruit trees, berries, and diversified agriculture. Also a decent amount of cattle farming.

The summers are dry, and in late August everything will be abundant, luscious, and ripe, but the land is fairly dry and the river is low. The terrain is fields, pasture, and farms interspersed with small stands of trees, especially or perhaps primarily along rivers / streams. Further upstream, you get into more resource extraction, primarily timber, but also furs, leather, other things historically traded with the Deno'qai.

Settlements are frequent and dense. The entire area is dotted with small [villages](onenote:#Chasa%20River%20Valley&section-id={95EC878F-1329-CA4B-8914-D9935B7418C7}&page-id={1D20B39C-B788-5F49-8231-74827D4507B9}&object-id={4D1A4951-78CA-2949-A47D-438DCC184BF9}&A&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/402ba7d9f74aa3e7/Documents/Taelgar/02_Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Adventures/The%20Elderwood%20(Session%2050-).one) usually a few miles apart (usually little more than a cluster of houses, a temple, sometimes a smith or brewer or other artisan), and [market towns](onenote:#Chasa%20River%20Valley&section-id={95EC878F-1329-CA4B-8914-D9935B7418C7}&page-id={1D20B39C-B788-5F49-8231-74827D4507B9}&object-id={4D1A4951-78CA-2949-A47D-438DCC184BF9}&E&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/402ba7d9f74aa3e7/Documents/Taelgar/02_Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Adventures/The%20Elderwood%20(Session%2050-).one) generally about 12-15 miles apart (so most villages are within a 6-8 mile walk of a market town), about a day's journey at a slow pace. The river is the lifeblood of the region and most villages and market towns are on the river, although farms extend out so there are outer rings of villages as well, although density drops considerably more than a couple day's journey from the river, except along minor tributaries (which are frequent).

There are four substantial cities along the way:

- [Metium](onenote:#Chasa%20River%20Valley&section-id={95EC878F-1329-CA4B-8914-D9935B7418C7}&page-id={1D20B39C-B788-5F49-8231-74827D4507B9}&object-id={4D1A4951-78CA-2949-A47D-438DCC184BF9}&18&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/402ba7d9f74aa3e7/Documents/Taelgar/02_Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Adventures/The%20Elderwood%20(Session%2050-).one) - closest to Chardon, a center of wine production and a major market/trading town at the confluence of the Chasa and Nahadi rivers. Within the same province as Chardon.
- [Erlona](onenote:#Chasa%20River%20Valley&section-id={95EC878F-1329-CA4B-8914-D9935B7418C7}&page-id={1D20B39C-B788-5F49-8231-74827D4507B9}&object-id={4D1A4951-78CA-2949-A47D-438DCC184BF9}&1E&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/402ba7d9f74aa3e7/Documents/Taelgar/02_Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Adventures/The%20Elderwood%20(Session%2050-).one) - Provincial capital of the Chasa Valley province. A rich and powerful province given the agricultural wealth of the valley.
- [Arkad](onenote:#Chasa%20River%20Valley&section-id={95EC878F-1329-CA4B-8914-D9935B7418C7}&page-id={1D20B39C-B788-5F49-8231-74827D4507B9}&object-id={4D1A4951-78CA-2949-A47D-438DCC184BF9}&24&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/402ba7d9f74aa3e7/Documents/Taelgar/02_Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Adventures/The%20Elderwood%20(Session%2050-).one) - Provincial capital of the Elderwood border province. A former city-state in the orbit of Kin-Aska, but was not completely destroyed. The name, Ara-qai, was "Chardonized" to Arkad.
- [Arendum](onenote:#Chasa%20River%20Valley&section-id={95EC878F-1329-CA4B-8914-D9935B7418C7}&page-id={1D20B39C-B788-5F49-8231-74827D4507B9}&object-id={4D1A4951-78CA-2949-A47D-438DCC184BF9}&2A&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/402ba7d9f74aa3e7/Documents/Taelgar/02_Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Adventures/The%20Elderwood%20(Session%2050-).one) - Border town and timber capital of the Elderwood province. Built on the destroyed city-state of Kin-Aska, a pre-Great War settlement of mixed Drankorian and Northros population.

There are three other notable landmarks:

- The Harmony Stone - a huge gray and white monolith, 60 feet high and tapering to a point, with a 15 foot diameter at the base. Carved with Elvish and Northros runes, badly eroded, apparently a place where humans and elves met and traded/signed treaties of peace and friendship. Has some magical ability to share stories of the past, at least for elves, and perhaps a distant echo of the plane of the Elven firstborn.
- Battle of Shadowfire site - this was a major defeat for Chardon and allies during the Blood Years, dragonfire burned the land and left a scar about 1/2 mile long and between 20-100 feet wide running parallel to the river, where nothing grows. This was once the front lines of the army, wiped out by the dragon advance. Many, many unburied dead lie here, their bodies turned to ash by dragonfire. The ruins of a major fortification also stand here, largely destroyed by the battle, but are considered haunted.
- Solas Abbey, the original but now ruined home of the Solatine Order, an iterant order of worshippers the Wyrdling who historically watched over orphans and outcasts, especially those who struggled with their gender identity. While the order is lost and defunct, and the Abbey mostly in ruins, a hermit/priest dedicated to the Wyrdling still lives here, and they still train apprentices.

Major landmarks on the journey:

- Mile 55: confluence with the Nahadi; major city (Metium); site of the victorious battle of the Chardonians against the hobgoblins and dragon conclave attacking from the east.
- Mile 133: The Harmony Stone
- Mile 208: Erlona
- Mile 255: Site of the Battle of Shadowfire, a major Chardonian defeat.
- Mile 363: Solus Abbey
- Mile 411: Arkad
- Mile 510: Arendum

## Villages

Most villages are just a handful of farms and homes around a common pasture. Rarely, if ever, will there be an 'official' place to stay, but it is relatively easy to crash in someone's barn for a few silver.

Typically little/nothing to buy in villages either, although could restock on food if needed, generally, although not trail rations. Some villages may have a smith.

Alternatively, some villages are really the estates of rich people. There is no concept of serfdom in the Chardonian empire, really - large estates that require significant labor to work are generally worked by paid laborers, not people bonded to the land in any way.

So you have a range of estates / villas / villages, where in some cases it is basically small holdings (retired soldiers, peasants); other cases large estates; and some intermediate cases where large estates were leased to tenant farmers.

The key thing is there is no feudal system - the landed aristocracy does not own all the land and there is no system of obligation between landed aristocracy and king / peasants. Defense is much more professionalized / organized by the Imperial state, and so land owners are just capitalists - no obligation to support defense or anything. Should feel a bit "modern" in a way. So while villages exist they are not the same kind of central instrument of feudal life in traditional European fantasy.

In many villages, the temple steward ends up being the highest immediately local village authority, although the local magistrate is never more than a day's walk away.

## Market Towns

A market town is distinguished by an Imperial charter, a market square, and at least one (and sometimes eight) temples, a magistrate who is elected by the citizens of the town and administers justice/collects taxes, and usually amenities such as public baths. Many towns also have a garrison, and each town has an area of responsibility outside its borders to administer justice and keep the peace in the surrounding villages.

Towns also have a responsibility to collect taxes and support tax collectors.

Market towns along the river valley vary in size and amenities, but most are laid out along a grid. The larger ones generally have walls, although often simple wooden palisades, not permanent stone.

## Metium

Metium was a small city in the orbit of Chardon in the pre-war period; even then it had a reputation as a trading post, wine center, and crossroads, with significant river traffic. During and just after war, attracted lots of fleeing refugees and grew quickly, enlarging the walls twice. Was the site of Chardon's victorious climatical battle during the Blood Years.

The most notable landmark is the massive Triumphal Arch in the center of the market square, commemorating the great victory over the hobgoblins and dragon conclave. Almost as significant is the Tomb of the Valiant Defender, another monument to honor that war.

In the current day, Metium is mostly known as the center of a major wine growing region. There is considerable wine trade through Metium's river port, both downriver to Chardon for local consumption or export, and upriver to Arendum or Lake Valandros for local consumption.

Vibe is commerce/wine/trade/money.

## Erlona

Provincial is the capital of the Chasa Valley province. A rich and powerful province given the agricultural wealth of the valley. This far upriver, there is less wine, but it is fertile pastureland and lots of cattle and dairy.

The most notable feature is a large coliseum/stadia. This houses the famous Forvitan Games, an annual gladiatorial competition, held in late September and associated with the Feast of the Warlord that marks the beginning of autumn and the first harvest.

As this is also the provincial capital, plenty of amenities here, and significant number of rich estates.

Architecturally a new city. Vibe is rich/cultured/theater/decadence.

## Arkad

Provincial capital of the Elderwood border province. A former city-state in the orbit of Kin-Aska, but was not completely destroyed. The name, Ara-qai, was "Chardonized" to Arkad.

This area is much more militarized, and the most notable feature of Arkad is the large garrison housed here (larger, even, than Arendum, as these are the reinforcements that cycle through the front lines). The city is defended with high quality walls, and there is a central fort / castle that houses the administration and military command.

There is also a frontier outpost of the Hetaeri Magica here, supported by an outpost of the Great Library, a minor provincial archive. This makes Arkad a center of magic in the frontier and a place where it would be possible to pay for someone to cast Sending if desired (and also a place where rumors from Chardon academics will spread quickly, so the party may have some notoriety here already).

Vibe is Imperial/magic/military.

## Arendum

Arendum is a substantial provincial town, with a frontier vibe. Built on the ruins of a former city-state, Kin-Aska, which was a Chardonian satellite, a mixed Northlander/Drankorian culture with good relations with the nearby Deno'qai tribes in the forests, as well as the elves. Kin-Aska was primarily a trading hub, and grew quite large.

Arendum is not as big, and the ruins of Kin-Aska are obvious. A large part of the ruined buildings have been reused to construct and repair the walls, which now are strong and thick. There are only two gates into town, and traffic is carefully watched -- especially with Deno'qai raids common these days.

However, the frontier is rich with timber wealth, and there are a fair number of people happy to take the risk to clear land and sell timber downstream to the saw mills. Definitely a bit of a "manifest destiny" vibe here, and at least among most of the Chardonian foresters, not a ton of concern for ecological sustainability. However, the deeper into the woods, the stranger and more magical, so more risks in that sense.

So should have a bit of the Voltara vibe, another frontier town built on natural resources: lots of activity outside the walls, plenty of logging camps, forester huts, some pasture (mostly cattle, some horse), and some farms.

Possibly a new outer wall is currently under construction to protect all this development from Deno'qai raids?

### Vibe

Should really feel more like a frontier as they get out east to Arendum. And less Chardonian - building on top of ruins gives the city a very different feel than other cities in the Chasa river valley. There are more ruins of small forts, towers, and the like in the outskirts, too.

Kin-aska architectural style was very "high gothic", Chardon is Romanesque and monumental, e.g.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture) vs
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesque_architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesque_architecture)

The idea being that Chardon nowadays explicitly looks back to Drankorian monumental and magical architecture. Lots of towers, magic decorations, big, monumental stuff. In contrast the Drankorian-inspired cities pre Great War looked to elves and others and developed a more decorative, pointed and elaborated architecture.

So for example in Arendum, there is probably the remains of gothic-looking buildings that have been repurposed. Similarly may be abandoned monasteries/temples etc in distinct gothic style.

Beyond architecture, the people here are proud Chardonians but also more independent and less "imperial" in some ways than Chardon. They are far away and a border province - not quite as dramatic as Voltara but still a fair bit of "fend for ourselves" type attitudes. This is aided/encouraged by the empire; much of the forested land is free for the taking by anyone who can claim it - the Empire makes its money on the taxes at sawmills and on the river trade (of course there are some rich landowners with large timber holdings, too).

Like other places in Chardon, the province is managed by a proconsul appointed by the Imperium in Chardon, but the city itself operates under charter from the Empire and holds elections for a magistrate to run the city.
