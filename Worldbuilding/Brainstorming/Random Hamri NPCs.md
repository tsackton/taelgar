**The Cursed Tower**

One of the earliest ocean watch towers, built near where the Mirmir cascades down the cliffs. Today, it is cracked, and the upper levels have collapsed and are open to the sky. Rumors persist that it is haunted, and cursed to never be rebuilt, although the circumstances of the curse are not clearly remembered. Various stories are told: a sea captain's husband, despairing of his wife ever returning, threw himself from the top; or perhaps it was a betrayal by a Chardonian trader; or perhaps a money lender who lost his wife to gazta.Â 
  

Whatever the truth of the rumors, all attempts to rebuild the place have failed and today it is truly abandoned.
  

[Wazir wouldn't know this, but it truly is haunted, but the ghosts are relatively easily appeased and it is used as an illicit market for gazta]

  


**Some Leviathan Oddballs**

These folks are some of the more interesting who have been hanging around the Leviathan. They could be totally irrelevant, or you could find a way to incorporate them in some kind of plotline, up to you. I've left their backgrounds full of weird hooks...

  
_Hala (they/them)_, a traveler from Suhaya who has been staying at the Leviathan for about ten weeks. Interested in trees and forests. Often spends several days at a time off wandering in the pine forests far above town. Claims to be seeking the Fey, although they won't explain why. Has a collection of foreign coins, and never seems to pay bills with local or Chardonian coins - Sembaran coins, or even ancient coins from fallen kingdoms seem to be what they carry. Speaks only in the trade tongues.
