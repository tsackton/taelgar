These are rough notes to organize thoughts on Deno'qai, elves, what old kingdoms treasure's are in Nymthrax's lair, etc.
 
1. Drankorian age. Drankor conquerors as far as Lake Valandros, but not really further. Mawar remains independent, as many of the 'coastal northerners' retreated to the Mawakel peninsula to avoid Drankorian conquest / assimilation. So you have:
    1. Coastal / south and west of Lake Valandros: Drankorian empire
    2. East of Lake Valandros: Ainumarya, the "second growth" elven kingdom, where many elves retreated after the fall of Alcarinquë.
    3. Among the elves and north of Ainumarya, extending up to the Forest of Dreams, you have a number of loosely connected Deno'qai communities, the "inland northerners"
    4. On the current-day Voltara plains and coast you have a number of Drankorian satellites, minor kingdoms, and the like, some more "Northern" and some more "Drankorian"
    5. To the north, you have Pandar, at this time mostly isolated and not yet obviously the growing power base of a great evil shadow dragon.
    6. West of Pandar is left undeveloped, as is the far north. These could be other strands of northerners, or non-humans.
2. Drankor falls. The empire dissolves into a variety of small kingdoms and city states, and there are probably a bunch of wars. What emerges is roughly the following, by say general "Great War" era
    1. Chardon is a major city-state, although not at this point an empire. It controls a decent swath of the fertile Chasa river valley, with some scattered satellite city states as you get more than a few hundred miles east (e.g. Kin-Aska), as well as the coastal area south of Chardon.
    2. The "fertile coast" north of Chardon is a series of small kingdoms / baronies, all with Drankorian identity, probably kind of like modern-day Cymea. These end up effectively unifying under Chardon for the Great War, and then become the base of the Chardonian Empire after the Blood Years.
    3. Between Chardon and Dunmar is a bit of a wildlands. You have lizardfolk, the myraeni people, probably some Illorians / related folks. South of the Yeraad this is not super-fertile land as you get into the Myraeni gap badlands. Can be left undeveloped. Possibly Elderwood extended further south. Once trade through Dunmar grows you have various minor city-states, things like that. A lot of these people are probably the ancestors of the Illorians who canonically have a confusingly mixed ancestry, and where the population grew during / after the great war as people fled the violence on the mainland.
    4. East of Lake Valandros you have Ainumarya and the Deno'qai.
    5.
