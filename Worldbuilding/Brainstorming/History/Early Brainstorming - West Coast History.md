Roughly speaking there was a lot of early hobgoblin wars, in the ~30 years after the Great War, but a lot of the recurrence of "hobgoblin trouble" in Dunmar and Sembara around 1575-1610 is due to Chardon crushing the hobgoblin threat in the west b/w 1545-1575, driving the survivors east and south and into the mountains. This was a series of defeats between 1545 and 1560, more or less, and then a series of counterattacks that broke the hobgoblin front line in the 1560s and early 1570s.   

So after about 1575/1580 in the west, the huge Cha'mutte armies are defeated and rebuiding begins. The land is almost entirely depopulated, with only a few isolated Northern settlements surviving (e.g. Mawar on the peninsula, and nomadic northerners in the wilds on the western slopes of the mountains, and probably others not yet made up). And there are probably tons of random monsters, isolated hobgoblin settlements, orcs, who knows what else that have basically just destroyed everything. So reconquest is slow, and I imagine goes in fits and starts depending on the fortunes of Chardon itself and the threat level, etc.   

By 1748 it has gotten as far north as Voltara, which is only slightly north of the Mawakel peninsula, but the Voltara area is definitely frontier feeling in many ways (and Voltara itself is largely significant as it is a source of chalyte mines), and probably has only been settled for 30 years, maybe a bit more.   
Other than that, I don't really have a vision for how Chardon turned from a city-state to an empire, and how the west changed over the 200 years since Cha'mutte. I think that conflict with northerners should be relatively recent, and for most of the Chardonian expansion it involved freeing land from various hobgoblin fiefs, monstrous domains, or just resettled empty land after it was cleared of manticores or whatever. Lots of ruins, lots of refugee movements and kind of a wild west without the colonization feel (until recently, when Chardon is coming into more conflict with the northern cultures). But there could be a lot of flexibility in that.   

But in short, yes, you'll need to make something up for the 1710s. The little history I have made up in this area for the Great Library campaign is really all just after the Great War stuff, or at least in the first 50 years or so, so really only up to 1600ish.
