Doc to copy over my notes on sentient races introduced in game but that have no real lore.

# Bullywugs
Little detail decided yet, but introduced to game.

TBD creation story, purpose, etc.

Speak their own language.

# Deva
Exist, not sure about lore yet.

Introduced one that crashed to the world via a meteor. I guess implies meteors are associated with extraplanar travel somehow.

# Merfolk
May exist many places in the world. %%SECRET[1]%%

Ambiguous gender. Perhaps switch sexes during development like some fish?

Otherwise few details determined.

# Mind Flayers
Abberations from elsewhere, presumably the Far Realm? So far just "generic alien underdark evil".

# Grimlocks
Twisted humans, created by mind flayers as a slave race. Blind. Some lived with Inakara and her derro band in the dwarven outpost near Raven's hold until they were slain by dwarven mission there.

# Derro
Twisted dwarves, the results of mind flayer experiments to create slave races. Severed from any connection to their firstborn and manipulated by mind flayers into their current form.

A small group of them lived in the dwarven outpost near Raven's Hold, but have recently been killed by a dwarven mission there.
