This is supposed to be a place to put notes from non-canonical or semi-canonical Taelgar adventures, which might still have either (a) useful development to refine and reuse, or (b) historical interest. 

Need to organize these notes a bit better, tag as needed, and make space to pull in notes from elsewhere for the historical record or as fodder for development.
