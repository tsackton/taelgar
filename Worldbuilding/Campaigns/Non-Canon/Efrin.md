%% a character made up for the aborted Plaguelands campaign %%

Before Darkwood Keep was attacked, there were rumors of things happening in the Darkwood, so Efrin was sent to scout it out, with a sending stone to report back to base. She discovered signs of a Cinder Court base in the woods, and has been heading in that direction to try to figure out what the goals of the Cinder Court cultists are, and why they have a base in the Darkwood. There are signs of disturbance - normally the forest is a delicate balance between good (or at least not evil) fey, dark fey, and spiders/beasts such as owlbears. But with the Cinder Court the dark fey have been empowered and have been pushing forward, and riling up the spiders and beasts. Efrin is fairly sneaky and has a sprite familiar (archfey patron, pact of the chain), has been relying on invisible sprite scouting ahead to avoid danger and learn info. Still no one is quite sure why the Cinder Court -- which is largely a group of humans and hobgoblins -- has a base in the Darkwood that seems connected to evil fey creatures and the Shadowfell.
