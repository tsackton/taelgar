btw, I was wondering if we should retcon the Urlich to be a pass not a monastery, or at least make the monastery secret/mystical rather than something people talk about


[11/5/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
(maybe it was always secret?)


[11/5/2023 8:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean it was lifted straight out of a dungeon magazine adventure, which I think we played, and then I just reused the location for the final battle


[11/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't remember much lore about why there was a monastery in a pass or whether the monasety was secret or not


[11/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but very easily could just be ulrich pass


[11/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
oh maybe there was some connection to the dwarven firstborn and the underground adventure to the proto-heart of the mountain?


[11/5/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
that would imply secret


[11/5/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
I think Ulrich Pass should be what people talk about, that's where the huge battle was. The "monastery" was obviously a real place of some sort (the final battle is one of the few things I remember really clearly from the high school game) but I think it should be a bit secret and maybe not really a monastry. If I recall it was some mystical place where the firstborn were more connected to taelgar or something


[11/5/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i am happy with urlich pass, and the Battle of Urlich Pass as the final battle of the Great War


[11/5/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
the monastery could just be an extraplanar weak point to the divine realm, historically protected by the dwarves or something like that. it is destroyed now anyway so the history isn't super important


[11/5/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
Although remember there was also a big battle at High Horn


[11/5/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't remember High Horn at all


[11/5/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't really remember it until I started digging through high school stuff on one drive


[11/5/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
I think one of your players in an abortive taelgar campaign you started in college was from there or something?


[11/5/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/5/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
But also, I think the big battle was not actually at Ulrich, although retconning it to be there is fine. I think we went south from the big battle to have the secondary mystical battle at the monastery


[11/5/2023 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess i think people would have seen the massive magical battle against the giant shadow dragon


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
it could be the Battle of High Horn and the Battle of Urlich Pass are considered two separate events


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, it is more satisfying to have had it taking place in the sky above the huge battle


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
with the Battle of Urlich Pass being you all gainst Cha'mutte


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
High Horn doesn't really exist anywyay


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
It would I guess by somewhere in Ardlas or so


[11/5/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
But that's currently envisioned as a place where there are no passes over the mountains, instead humans traded with dwarves who traded with humans on the other side


[11/5/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I see it on the map


[11/5/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
let's just retcon it away

Although it would suit the narrative history of Sembara if the highland kingdoms felt like the fought a thankless and costly unacknowledged war


[11/5/2023 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
that could also work - it isn't really acknowledged as the key battle of the war


[11/5/2023 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
The Sembaran armies massed at Ulrich Pass to stop the "main advance" of the hobgoblins from the west, and were the heroes who stood in the shadows of the actual heroes, and it becomes this whole myth-making thing


[11/5/2023 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
Well all this time, the highland kingdoms bled with the dwarves in the north, with no real support, and if they hadn't been there the Sembaran armies wouldn't have had a home to come back to


[11/5/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
Which actually works well with both the notes I have from highschool (that Sembaran "north armies" were weaker and less well supported) and the latter history


[11/5/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
When the hobgoblins attack Ardlas in the 1560s and Sembara still doesn't send aid, its the last straw, and causes these diplomatic breaks.


[11/18/2023 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
Is there a canonical date when Hralgar was trapped?


[11/18/2023 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
only roughly. he was free during the reign of Akaston, and Eudomes both a) trapped him and b) was alive and had to flee during the first plague


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
so that would be roughly 1010-1020 probably?


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
need to double-check Akaston reign end


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
the notes say Apolloyon


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
When the Golden Age ended in civil war, and the [[Omnis Pura]] came to power, things became more difficult, and some time later he was trapped by Eudomes, during Apollyon's reign.


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
is that wrong, should I fix to Akaston


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that's right. i mean Hralgar told you that the emperor he remembered was Akaston, this was the time period he was imaging in the dreamworld in his pre-trapped state


[11/18/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
Apollyon's reign was long so trapped during his reign would make sense


[1/2/2024 10:50 PM] .deciusmus
In another my game topic, the lich's plan to destroy Sembara is coming into view.... 

Step 1: Cast a really powerful and hard to cast spell (took a year or two of prep) that caused a decent percent (1%?) of the dead in southern Sembara to rise up as zombies/skeletons/etc
Step 2: Absolutely and completely mismanage the response...


[1/2/2024 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
really minor point


[1/2/2024 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
The mismanagement involves things like imposing a wealth tax to raise an army, but doing so on halflings and lizardfolk as well as humans (which is not what sembaran law says)


[1/2/2024 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
Having some of his controlled barons (he only has a few) collect the tax twice


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
Mixing up the army and sending it various different places, so Fellburn stays under siege from a bunch of hobgoblin zombies through the winter,


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
Specifically trying to stir up the Duke of Wisford so he rebels


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
etc


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] .deciusmus
Whatever my PCs do, a group of adventures is going to kill the lich in 6 months (July 1720) and things will get fixed after that


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
why does the lich want to destroy Sembara again?


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
or does it not matter for the campaign?


[1/2/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
It matters a lot for the 2nd part of the campaign, but not entirely sorted out. The short version is that he was a wizard with a desire for life extension, doing dubious research, the House of Sewick specifically destroyed his research/tried him for illegal magic, he escaped, vowed revenge on the House of Sewick


[1/2/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
So actually it is less about destroying Sembara than the House of Sewick specifically. Probably he is hoping one of the northern dukes will eventually organize a coup of some kind


[1/2/2024 10:56 PM] .deciusmus
I have a vague backstory but I need to work it out a little bit more, at the moment it is still a bit unclear, other than a personal vendetta against the House of Sewick for what he sees as ruining his life


[1/2/2024 11:01 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed one more book - contains a bunch of stories about fey - less impact on other parts of the world or things you made up, but I did leave it status/tim

writing notes on Delwath's dream conversation with Sura. what are you specifically trying to learn here? Sura is mostly going to want to talk about surviving the experience of losing a chunk of your life, having never expected to find someone else who survived a similar experience, but for someone with Delwath's persuasion and charisma it would presumably be pretty easy to steer the conversation to whatever you want to learn


[1/3/2024 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
Delwath would be happy to be a dream therapist for Sura (or more accurately, to start a part-of-your-life-disappeared support group via Dream), and would honestly probably get sucked into that kind of conversation pretty easily


[1/3/2024 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
For "stuff to learn" mostly just "how is the negotiations of Karnas going" / "what's the state of the conflict"


[1/3/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
FYI I think Delwath will keep up the dream-based lost-time-survivors-support-group over our downtime. Not every night but once a week or once every 10 days or so,  influenced by Sura's interest as well obviously


[1/3/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
I'll ask the gods at some point if they know of anyone nearby who has lost time in extra-dimensional spaces other than the Feywild (hint hint for the Deno'qai who would be in the same boat, right?)


[1/3/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, the tanshi say, there is some relatively close in the same boat


[1/3/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have an "official" layer for Sembaran borders? Is there any reason for me to not just draw stuff myself for now?


[1/3/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't have an up-to-date borders layer in the official map, no


[1/3/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
no reason not to draw it yourself. it is tough to label lots of things in the big map otherwise everything is just covered in text


[1/3/2024 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
what font did you use for your labels

I've been mucking about with Sembara in more detail, as I try to work out the impacts of this mass of undead. Not really changing much from the big Sembara document, but a few things I wanted to at least vaguely run by you...

The basic idea of the new map is that 
(a) there is a core unit of the six ancient duchies and a few border baronies (Aveil + Ainwick) which is the historic ancient Sembara
(b) this is all the lowlands ... as the land rises north and west of several different lines of hills, you get into a loosely defined border with the highland kingdoms. There are lots (at least a dozen, perhaps two dozen) baronies here, and there is no "formal border" but really a loose line of loyalties. This "highland Sembara" stretches all the way from the Volta to the Wistel..
(c) Then there are the southern borderlands (south of the Enst) and the western borderlands (west of Ainwick/Cleenseau). These are all lands that have had significant post-Great War distruption. The western borderlands were largely depopulated in the aftermath of the Great War, as the destruction of Urlich Pass changed the entire economic rationale, and refugees fled west. A small number of military towns (i.e. Dunmore from the original one-shot) remained, but the land would have been really sparsely populated in the 1580s.
The lands south of the Enst were ruled by hogoblins for 50 years in the early 1600s


[1/4/2024 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
So basically, all of the infrastructure west of Aveil/Ainwick and south of the Enst was rebuilt/reestablished during the long peaceful reign of Cece I, which I imagine was also a baby boom time. Settlers were flowing west and south to populate these new lands, etc


[1/4/2024 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
The far western baronies (Dunfry/Usbourg/Enford/Bronva) were explicitly establised by Cece as military districts, although by 1748 the direct military relationship has probably faded, especially in Dunfry and Usbourg


[1/4/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
The southern baronies (I have 5 but might expand to 6 or 7) were all new grants, also by Cece, largely to loyalists from the wars. That section (between the Enst and Adderfell) is probably decent farmland, it was just ravaged by hobgoblins and war. So it is probably somewhat booming these days, lots of growth


[1/4/2024 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
historically, Maseau and Adderfell were never part of "historic" Sembara. Maseau was established by Derik I after his defeat of Atavas, as basically new land,


[1/4/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
Adderfell I think has always had close ties with Tyrwingha, and is probably only not part of Tyrwingha because the Tyrwinghan borders are set by Ethlenn for mysterious reasons and she doesn't want it -- although it is likely somewhat congruent with her kingdom.


[1/4/2024 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
For a long time the earls of Adderfell probably looked to Tyrwingha for direction, and they only gradually came into the Sembaran orbit after Derik became king of Tyrwingha. But probably in some formal sense, it has never been "ruled" by Sembara in the sense that its always been an allied state, not a specific and direct place ruled by the monarch, so to speak


[1/4/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this all basically works. one thing to think about is who exactly are the people living in these places? I've been reading the Great Sea again (the Mediterranean book I started in Nantucket, but I got bored after the fall of Rome and put it aside for a while until recently), and one thing that is really clear from this, which is probably obvious but perhaps isn't incorporated enough into Taelgar worldbuilding, is that you have these big empires that expand and contract across the Mediterranean over 600 years, but for the most part, the people don't move around (with some exceptions like medieval spain and some trade colonies)


[1/4/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
so I guess I would think a bit about what the cultures are here


[1/4/2024 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
Well, that's part of why I want the Great War to have been so depopulating


[1/4/2024 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, you have refugee movements and resettlement too


[1/4/2024 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
I think basically there are two ancient cultures here -- the highland culture and the lowland culture, which spread up the river valleys


[1/4/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
Within the lowland culture (which is the core of Sembara today) you have a Tyrwinghan variant, which isn't hugely different, but has some unique strains via the fey connection


[1/4/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
Maseau is always been a bit of a marginal borderland.


[1/4/2024 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I would think Maseau would have been fairly rich Drankorian province, if only by nearby association with Isingue


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm, maybe


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but probably no need to go back that far, really


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like the land is less fertile.


[1/4/2024 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
The southern part of Maseau, probably. The northern section south of the Enst is kinda marginal farmland, compared to more eastern Sembara


[1/4/2024 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
But also, ignoring that far back


[1/4/2024 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
Start with Atavas, say


[1/4/2024 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
The whole area between Insingue and Sembara is under hobgoblin rule for some time. They probably don't kill everyone, but you would imagine that as being pretty disruptive


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, and at that point for a while it probably feels like Sembara is pretty cut off


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
insignue is still connected to Dunmar-Chardon trade routes and the Green Sea via Orenlas / Cymea / "South Cymea"


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[1/4/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
And I suspect a lot of refugee flows *south* during the Atavas wars


[1/4/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that would make sense - this is also the height of Dunmar's military power


[1/4/2024 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right, so that seems like a safer bet. But Derik is the one who actually defeats Atavas, and has an upper hand at reestablishing the human kingdoms in the region


[1/4/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Isingue is closer to Kharsan than Tokra to Kharsan, for example


[1/4/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
So he finds someone suitable, makes them a Duke and gets them to pledge feudal loyalty to him, and so a somewhat depopulated Maseau - which its own more Insinguen culture somewhat distinct from Sembara gets incorporated into the kingdom


[1/4/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
So at the eve of the Great War you have basically 5 cultures in Sembara:

* The highland culture
* The lowland culture, which spreads all the way to the mountains along the Enst
* The Tyringhan vairnt of the lowland culture, also in Adderfell
* The Maseau culture, kinda weakened/depopulated
* The northern/Tollen-influenced culture which is another variant of Sembaran, but basically not too different, along the Volta


[1/4/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right I was just typing exactly same thing but slower


[1/4/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
politically, the lowland culture is very dominant at this point, as well


[1/4/2024 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of fell like Tyrwingha is a bit more diverged than this makes it seem, though. by the time of the Great War, the Tyrwinghans have been living under the protection of the fey for ~1000 years


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i would think that would not be a minor influence


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but part of Drankor


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
But yeah, actually, I have been playing in my game Tyrwingha has more different than "a variant"


[1/4/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
My player with a Tyrinwghan PC has a tendency to play her character as "somewhat foreign, why do these Sembarans do things weird" which I have not discourged


[1/4/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
but I think it works with the above, i.e. Tyrwingha probably feels pretty different. The unification of the two realms has always been a personal union of crowns, not some kind of real "single country"


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so then you have Great War, west is upended, plaguelands, all that


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right. And then in the early 1600s everything south of the Enst is ruled by hobgoblins for 50 years


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
almost


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
40-something


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
at this point everyone who survives is basically just pledging themselves to Derik III in desperation


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
Right, although Sembara also is abandoning people left and right


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
after Derik III dies though


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/4/2024 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so at that point I think there is room for a bit more complex set of loyalities and obligations that doesn't result in Sembara just being one big country in a modern sense


[1/4/2024 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
you already have personal union of crowns that joins Sembara and Tyrwingha


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but for example adderfell can have relatively shifting loyalities


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah - although I think Adderfell has been more of a Tyrwinghan than Sembaran allied state


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
historically


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
then of course this motivates Cece I to install loyalists in the newly created duchies / marches


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think a lot of places perhaps have more of a feel of "the Barony of Aveil" than "Sembara", wouldn't they?


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
Well, I think that changed during Cece's reign


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
it was 60-ish years of peace and prosperity


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
everyone loved her


[1/4/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
Well, let me think it through


[1/4/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean my sense historically is that it often was not very important to the people of random place X whether their lord owed alliegance to the king of france or the king of england, except insomuch as it meant they might be killed fighting in a war


[1/4/2024 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
It seems like at the beginning of Cece's reign, you have:

* Maseau, which has been separated from Sembara by a hobgoblin kingdom for 50 years and also has had its own influx of refugees and challenges on its southern border
* Adderfell, which is also separated from Sembara by hobgoblins, and probably heavily dependent on the Tyrwinghan knights for aid which stuff gets bad
* Tyrwingha, which has only been recently rejoined with the Sembaran crown and which has a pretty distinct culture at this point


[1/4/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
* The highlands, which really are a place of shifting loyalties, where the "border" is kinda meaningless, and some local lord might be loyal to the monarch of Ardlas rather than Sembara, and which might feel very much like the "barony of whatever" rather than sembara or ardlas specifically


[1/4/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
* The core ancient duchies, which I think includes Aveil and Ainwick (although they were historically the border baronies and loyal to the Duke of Wisford)


[1/4/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
* The western military baronies, still very much army camps and frontier, not so many people


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the bigger worldbuilding question is: given all the danger out there, and magic, and the gods, do humans actually regularly fight wars of conquest?


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
No, I think probably not


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think I agree


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, sometimes things happen - i.e. Chardon + Dunmar. But you don't have stuff like the Norman Conquest of England that often


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm thinking about the approximately 1000 wars fought over siciliy, for example


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
you could imagine a scenario where northern cymea is constantly changing hands to control the straights


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
or the long term war between the english and french kings over france


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the question then is, the absence of wars of conquest, what changes alliegance? i think generally there would be a very strong incentive to be allied with someone bigger


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is a feeling of safety


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example most of the Drankorian conquest of Sembara isn't really a war. it is "we have a huge army and a million wizards" and the sembarans going "awesome come stay"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Sure


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Although there are exceptions, i.e. the highlanders


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right, obviously


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it *all* has to be "no war conquest"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
no, of course not, but a lot less than in the real world


[1/4/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, agreed


[1/4/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but I actually think that means you tend to have a bit more local identity, e.g. Barony of Aveil is not not-Sembaran, exactly - the people who live there are largely Sembaran in culture


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
and while through long ties of alliance and culture, Aveil is always looking to Sembara first, Sembara probably wouldn't march knights on them if the next Baron refused to swear alliegance to the king


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
they might, of course


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but it would be far from a guarantee


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think that is true


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, if an upstart knight in Cleenseau declares himself king of the river lands, the Baron of Aveil almost certainly is marching knights against him, I would think


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
Although I think its a bit more complicated than that


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the " long ties of alliance and culture" elides a lot, yes


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but, it would be a reason why the lich would imagine this plan could work


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think the Baron of Aveil is a bad example only because I have in my mind that it has ancient ties to the Duchy of Wisford


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
The big duchies are a better example


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
But yes, I agree


[1/4/2024 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
I think at some level, the lich is trying to get the six duchies to each one declare indepedence from Sembara and destroy the sembaran crown that way


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
The first step is to get Wisford, which I think is one of the most powerful duchies, to suceed


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
I think an interesting historical model is actually in a way the early modern Spanish crown


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right with land and stuff all over the place?


[1/4/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
no I was thinking you have castile, aragon, etc


[1/4/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
they are unified and all owe allegiance to the same king but also you have powerful local power bases


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
right before the hapsburgs


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
like 1500s

Composite monarchy
A composite monarchy (or composite state) is a historical category, introduced by H. G. Koenigsberger in 1975 and popularised by Sir John H. Elliott, that describes early modern states consisting of several countries under one ruler, sometimes designated as a personal union, who governs his territories as if they were separate kingdoms, in accor...


[1/4/2024 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right although I dont actually want to make up 6 different sets of taxes and laws and such üôÇ


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right I wouldn't go to that extreme


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
you just need vibes


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
basically the point is the Duke of Wisford is an important person with independent power


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
And in fact, in a weird position right now, because their historic influence over the southern Enst border has waned significantly


[1/4/2024 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
Because after Wisford bore the brunt of the Shattered Ice Clan attacks, and then Cece's resettlement was focused on crown loyalists


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
And actually I have it in my plan that the baron of Aveil is actually working for the lich or controlled by the lich or something


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
Which works really well to isolate Wisford


[1/4/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
And then, on top of that:
* Wisford has close ties to the lizardfolk of Ozabal Swamp
* Fellburn was a center of a lot of battles, so there are a lot of dead. It is going to suffer a lot more form the raise 0.5% of dead than many places


[1/4/2024 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, I agree with all of that


[1/4/2024 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
The other point I was going for in my thinking above is that the southern and western baronies are basically "new" from Cece's reign


[1/4/2024 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
And the southern borderlands in particular have grown a lot - good farmland then, and a sense of economic possibilities..


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think those baronies would have largely (entirely?) been personal possessions of the crown


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
whether that is still true in 1750 can be an open question


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, after reconquest, for sure


[1/4/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
But I think Cece gifted a lot of of them out


[1/4/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
And probably in the chaos after the lich dies Wisford gets back some level of control


[1/4/2024 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
especially because the next queen is Elaine II who is strongly Tyrwinghan


[1/4/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
and so I think in 1750, its more balanced -- the crown has more wealth and resources partly from an expanded royal demense in the south, but also at least some of the barons are currently back in the Wisford orbit


[1/4/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure it matters much, its all a peaceful land these days. The action is in Adderfell / March of Andonne / Aurbez


[1/4/2024 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I was thinking Maseau might have gained at the expense of Wisford


[1/4/2024 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that is possible as well


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway doesn't really matter for now


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
Oh, one last thought -- I'm trying to figure out when the western wall was built


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking maybe recently -- during Cece's reign, by dwarves, with some magical assistance from Tollen


[1/4/2024 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that works. I am pretty sure I explicitly imagined the wall was *not* there for the stone titan one shot


[1/4/2024 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and then it wouldn't have really made sense as a place to build a wall during the hobgoblin occupation


[1/4/2024 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so I would probably put it ~1660-1670


[1/4/2024 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also make it more magical


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
it is not just with the help of dwarves, it is with the help of stone giants


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
or something like that


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
or earth elementals


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
right, I like elementals more than stone giants. But yeah, good point


[1/4/2024 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
it might not really matter exactly. maybe there are lots of rumors


[1/4/2024 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe cece found a ring of three wishes and wished for a wall


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
ooh, I like that


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
maybe Cece stole a ring of three wishs from the lich


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
before he was a lich


[1/4/2024 10:18 PM] rsulfuratus
only potential flavor issue there is a ring of three wishes is about as arcane magic as arcane magic gets


[1/4/2024 10:18 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, true


[1/4/2024 10:19 PM] .deciusmus
although maybe it was Cece's secret


[1/5/2024 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a image that I might use as a emblem for Avatus:

assets/avatus-symbol-sketch.png


[1/5/2024 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
Any concerns? This is coming up in my game via some undead warriors ressurected from battlefields of the Atavus wars


[1/5/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
looks fine to me


[1/5/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Working more on my Dunmar page. Trying to model a bit on Wikipedia with say a short section on ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù and then a link to a longer page as needed as I feel like it is kind of a lot to have 1000 words on Dunmari politics if you just want a quick overview


[1/5/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
‚ÄúExpanded‚Äù notes for geography, religion, and history have obvious homes


[1/5/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
But eg politics, culture, economy and trade, justice/law don‚Äôt right now


[1/5/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking about the same issues for Sembara, i.e. tax law is going to be relevant in the session after next, I was going to try to pull togeher some notes but was't sure where to put it


[1/5/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
For now I‚Äôm thinking about just leaving in gazetteer


[1/5/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to suggest the same


[1/5/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, going back to the Highland Kingdoms name, I was going to make a obsidian change for a new tenative name...

Do you prefer 

Zimka (people)/Zimkovia (place) 
Pemvos (people)/Pemvora (place)


[1/5/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
Not necessarily final, but I want to start using something oher than highlands in other stuff about sembara region


[1/5/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
Although I like Zimka / Zimkovia (or Zimkova), Zovcka is probably too similar, so would probably need to change


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, Zovcka is the place that sees itself as "the true home" of the Zimka people


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
hence the similarity of name


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, maybe a little too confusing in actual game but I think it works from a worldbuilding perspective


[1/5/2024 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
eh I'm not really sold, I think the names are kind of in an uncanny valley where they are close enough that you confuse them but not so close as to be obviously from the same root


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure why you couldn't just change the name of Zovcka, as far as I know it has never come up in any game


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
yeah you might be right


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, changing Zovcka is no problem


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
The term "highlander" has come up a few times in my game but I don't have any issue just changing it, it is just background color. And none of the kingdom names matter


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
honestly I'm not even sure Zovcka is a kingdom


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
highlander is just what the sembarans call the Zimka


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
But it came up because one of the players speaks Zimka, but again, no issue just telling him I renamed the languag


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly I might just erase Zovcka for now


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
why does there have to be a specific name for the Zimka people north of Breva that were never controlled by Sembara?


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
(rhetorical question)


[1/5/2024 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
Actually the more I think about that I like it because naming it as a "kingdom" kinda guides the mind in a certain direction, and I'm not sure the Zimka really have the same concept of kingship as the sembaras


[1/5/2024 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm working a bit on land tenure in Sembara, and based on our previous conversation, rethinking a bit about how it grew outside the original six duchies.


[1/5/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
The original timeline I wrote imagined a series of conquests but that doesn‚Äôt really feel right


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
Who was living in these places after the fall of Drankor? I‚Äôm not really sure.


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
That said the Great War depopulated a lot of it so maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think I'd bother to write much of that old history


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that was the conclusion I was coming to


[1/5/2024 1:35 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing that is obvious after revisiting my old dunmar notes is that while I had some good bones of things, there is a lot in the old google docs that turned out to be wrong after playing a game in dunmar for 3 years, and it is a lot easier now to write up a good dunmar page. 

so I'm kind of inclined to be a little careful over-inventing stuff - or at least committing to stuff as canon - too early


[1/5/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a complete draft of my rewritten Dunmar note, curious if you have any feedback, especially on organization


[1/5/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
subnotes are not generally done, or are just notes


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I'm looking at dunmar


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a note on land holding in sembara that I'd appreciate thoughts on


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
largely based on medieval england and the complexity of French/Normal law vs Anglo-Saxon law


[1/5/2024 3:27 PM] .deciusmus
I like the organization a lot


[1/5/2024 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
on sembaran land ownership - I think the vibe feels right in general. specific comments mostly on non-humans


[1/5/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
One comment on Dunmar, btw: what are the borders, exactly? Is there some set of land that is considered "dunmar" by the gods?


[1/5/2024 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
my feeling is probably not


[1/5/2024 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
the "the gods own the land" is more of a cultural/religious aspect of dunmari culture than the gods actually owning the land


[1/5/2024 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
although i do have a bunch of old, dubiously canonical notes about the gods specifically bringing the dunmari to this place for a particular purpose


[1/5/2024 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
or perhaps it goes the other way, the longer the dunmari occupy a place, the more the gods grow to inhabit it


[1/5/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
I like the vibe of the dunmari being more a people than a place, per se.


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
That is, Dunmar doesn't really have formal borders or political organization, it is the membership in a temple and the relationship of the temple to the Samraat that matters, not where you live


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that is definitely true


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
So I think the political organization in the note could clarify that a bit more


[1/5/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I also kind of like the idea that the reason it is Shakun - after all, a rather minor diety - is responsible for the defense of the eastern border from all kinds of bad things is specifically because unlike the five siblings, she was born to a Dunmari and had a physical connection to the land


[1/5/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway on land holdings:


[1/5/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
1. dwarves I think would certainly own land, but probably never not outright (and even taxes might be complicated). dwarves would very likely outlive the lord of the manor, and there could theoretically be dwarven communities that have passed down land for longer than Sembara has existed


[1/5/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure exactly how this would play out and it probably isn't formalized in the way that relationships with lizardfolk and halflings are


[1/5/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but it doesn't seem very dwarvish for a dwarf to consider themselves a "peasant"


[1/5/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think maybe that's just a poor choice of words in my doc


[1/5/2024 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think freehold land is particularly "subserviant"


[1/5/2024 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
well yes, even putting aside the subserviant aspect


[1/5/2024 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno, if the dwarf buys Sembaran land, why would they be against paying taxes onit?


[1/5/2024 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
Or why wouldn't a dwarven smith by willing to lease some land from a lord, or whoever, because they didn't intended to stay for more than 30-50 years, so a 50 year lease seemed better than outright buying the land?


[1/5/2024 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think they would be against paying taxes on it - or even, necessarily, leasing it. i'm thinking about the opposite arrangement though, where the dwarves are already there and perhaps have been there for a while, and the land is now claimed as crownland or whatever


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
RIght, in those cases I just think the land would have never been claimed as crownland


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
Its folkland


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, sure, okay, that makes sense


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
I actually envision the legal arrangements in some places as being quite complex


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so you might have little bits of folkland on a manorial estate that was in some dwarven family since before barony of X even exists


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, exactly


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Now, the dwarves might sell it, in which case it becomes crownland


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
You can't really sell folkland outside of your "folk"


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
so in this case, to non-dwarves


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
By the dwarves could sublease it, or whatever


[1/5/2024 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, I think that works. dwarves are basically fine with debts and obligations and would generalyl fit in the system, although I think could be a lot of odd quirks (e.g. a dwarf might offer a very large sum instead of annual taxes in order to turn a piece of crownland back into folkland, for some  reason)


[1/5/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, that's basically the same idea as the lizardfolk. You are negoiating with the duke or king or queen


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the only think I would change about lizardfolk is that there is probably room for a range of attitudes here


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
all lizardfolk consider their land folkland


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but some lizardfolk might consider much of lowland sembara as "lizardfolk land"


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
since historically (long ago) it was


[1/5/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
so there may be times when lizardfolk just settle without asking for permission and dare the local lord to do something about it


[1/5/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
this doesn't have to be common but I don't think relationships between sembarans and lizardfolk need to be 100% peaceful all the time


[1/5/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
true. I'm just not sure I want to set up Sembara in the role of colonizer taking the indigenous land


[1/5/2024 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
fair, although it is pretty different since the humans were there long ago too, and the lizardfolk weren't driven out by the humans


[1/5/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Right, just if it comes up in an actual game I'd want it to be more differentiated and less coded as "hey this was our land, we are taking it back"


[1/5/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I wouldn't play it as that. I don't think the lizardfolk would view sembaran settlements as occupying stolen land - it is more a question of rents on profits


[1/5/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
and whether it is formally sensible to lay claim to unsettled, unimproved land


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps (some) lizardfolk understand unimproved, unsettled land as simply empty and free to be claimed by anyone willing to work it


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
the sembarans who settled and built cities are doing exactly what they should - settle and grow and the land is yours


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
it is only the idea of a lord saying "this land is mine by right of whatever" *without* settling it or working it


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
Right, in fact, the ancient idea of folkland matches that exactly and could even have come (at least in part) from the lizardfolk


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
of course going back to earlier conversations about lizardfolk they might have very different ideas of what improving land means


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think the vibe is still right regardless of details - the basic idea is the land supports you and you support it, and that is what gives you property rights


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
not the fact that you marched an army through two years ago


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
(Some) lizardfolk then just reject all the "overlord/sovereign" stuff


[1/5/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps other lizardfolk see the building walls and maintaining borders as "improving" the land in a way that gives the crown control


[1/5/2024 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
It could just play almost as a disagreement about scope. Is maintaining a road through a wilderness an improvement to all of that empty land?


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
and I think it is more interesting if there are a range of opinions and disagreements among the lizardfolk

[1/5/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
now, halflings are more complicated


[1/5/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
Ultimately almost all of the "new" crownland outside of the ancient duchies either came about via 
* a slow process of accretion as (human) families died out, or sold land, and various tracts and bits and pieces came under the control of the crown
* major depopulation events were reversed by armies, and the crown claimed all the land they freed from the hobgoblins/whatever


[1/5/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I really don't think halflings would give a hoot about some human lord. if a halfling family wants to settle down and run an inn on the road between fellburn and rinburg, they aren't going to negotiate with some lord


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
they are going to build an inn, and run it. or negotiate with someone who owns an inn, and take it over


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
the whole concept that someone can "own" land feels very un-halfling


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that said, they probably feel fine about paying taxes


[1/5/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
but also probably have their own opinions about what taxes are fair


[1/5/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Do you envision halflings as just kinda like ignoring local law?


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, almost completely


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Presumably they aren't going to just decide this piece of farmland looks nice so I'm just going to take it over


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
It seems hard to be a member of society in a fixed location and ignore the laws


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
well, they have their own laws


[1/5/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example you can't just take stuff would be enforced at the halfling end of things not the human end of things, so to speak


[1/5/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Why would humans put up with that though?


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
I guess if it works and doesn't really cause problems


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
well usually halflings are pretty well behaved, and they are quick to punish their own troublemakers


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
But why would the human lords of the land tolerate a halfling effectively just stealing their land?


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I don't really imagine halflings wanted to build a home in the middle of nowhere


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
people tolerate it because it doesn't always end up as "stealing"


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
If you are building an inn just outside the walls of Rinburg, what, they just do it even though someone owns that land?


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that is the "you can't just take land"


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I'd imagine it like this. say a halfling family wants to start an inn outside Rinburg


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a nice orchard near the river, just along the road, that seems perfect.


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
the set up camp in the orchard, and let it be known that they want to stay


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
and then they wait


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
probably they don't build anything for a year, but they have a little market


[1/5/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
presumably at some point -- relatively soon, unless it is owned by an absentee landlord or something -- whoever owns the orchard (if they aren't the person working it every day) shows up


[1/5/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the halflings ask if they can build an inn, and what the person wants


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
if they can't come to an agreement, they move on. maybe they come back in a generation and see if the new owners are more amenable


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but most people agree pretty quickly, because the halflings remember strange things. you don't want your kids cursing you out for refusing a good offer


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
and sometimes what the halflings offer is way more than what the land is worth


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but isn't that in fact "negoitating with some lord"?


[1/5/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess I was more thinking about chains of obligations


[1/5/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
But land really doesn't have a chain of obligations


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
well, you owe tax to someone


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, but most taxes are only on argicultural produce


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
An inn doesn't owe property tax


[1/5/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
and halflings, for example, might not always agree on who owns land. if you are a peasant who has a 50 year lease, the halfings might decide you own the land, not the lord


[1/5/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but it gets dicey for the person with the 50 year lease


[1/5/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
sure. although there are probably plenty of stories (true or false) of halflings who gave some peasant a comparatively huge some of money for land they didn't technically own, and then the peasant just skipped town


[1/5/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and left the halflings to deal with the lord


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right, and the retribution would fall on the peasant not the haflings ,ultimately, because the lord doesn't want to piss off the halflings


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
that is why they skip town


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
But sometimes they are caught anyway


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
of course. basically the idea is the haflings don't really interact with the formal system of land registeries and deeds


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
And othertimes the halflings are forced to leave, although that probably doesn't end well for the lord


[1/5/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don't have a good sense of halflings view of collective punishment


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point schwartz and discussed this and were leaning towards the idea that halflings have a very strong sense of familial justice - so if your great great grandparent cheated their great great grandparent you are in trouble


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
Right I more meant if a lord pushes the halflings out, do they punish everyone who lives in the manor?


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
Or just the lords family


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
no, just the lords family


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
But they might not always have a good mechanism to do that


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
right, which is why sometimes the halflings get pushed out


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
Also, it doesn't strike me as obvious that the halfling would decide that the yearly lease-fee is meaningless, i.e. would they actually want to ruin some small scale landholder?


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
I guess maybe sometimes they do


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
and other times they don't


[1/5/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
halflings are supposed to feel kind of chaotic


[1/5/2024 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
sometimes they. might double the yearly lease fee the previous owner was paying for no clear reason apparent to the landholder


[1/5/2024 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
What is a halfling view on contracts?


[1/5/2024 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I think their view is roughly something like my present self cannot compel an obligation from my future self to your future self\


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
of course this can't be taken to the extreme or you couldn't even buy something from them


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think generally most people would be wary of long term contracts with halflings


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. you'd never make a 50 year lease with a halfling imagining it would be kept


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
you'd make a series of 1 year leases


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
But I think from the perspective of Sembaran land holding, it boils down to 
(a) a halfling would consider the land theirs as long as they had purchased it fairly and they were still using it
(b) halflings don't always agree with the Sembaran legal system as to who the owner is or what theterms of purchase "should be"


[1/5/2024 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
right, and if they acquire a freehold, and would normally owe a manorial tax, they might also not agree with the lord on what the manorial tax should be - they would view this as a negotiation where the amount owed might include 0, instead of something the lord gets to decide


[1/5/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
Well...


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't refactored the taxes part, but I think for the most part the manorial taxes are a percetage of the harvest


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
If you build an inn, nothing is due


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but then doesn't the growth of a city just cost money? unless the lord is getting it back in other taxes


[1/5/2024 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
I have a separate taxes document that basically has 3 main taxes:

the deca and nonem, which are 1/10 and 1/9 of the harvest (so collectively, 19% of the harvest), due on argicultural produce
the hearth tax, due from every building with a hearth


[1/5/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, sure, then halflings might pay the hearth tax but consider it a negiotiation to set a fair rate


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Then, additionally, there is a baronial tax, owed by the baron to the crown or duke, for which the baron has to collect money


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Often via market taxes, taxes on inns, poll taxes (i.e. tax per person), bridge/road taxes, etc


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
But I kinda assume halflings would generally pay these, if they saw them as fair taxes for the stuff they are gettig (.e. use of a road)


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so this is a bit separate from landowning per se but the general view of halflings would not be "we don't pay those taxes" it would be "we offer you what is fair and negotiate"


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
And it probably comes out in the wash, i.e. the one time the baron gets stiffed, but some other time a halfling caravan pays 10x as much


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
So mostly who is going to complain


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that people should see halflings a bit like a lottery ticket but with fair odds


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
and then human pyschology takes over and the stories of winning circulate in a way that the stories of losing don't


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
Right the other bit is mandatory gifts, i.e. the lord of manor might expect gifts from everyone on the birth of the heir


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
but of course, this would also apply might more gently to halflings


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea of a mandatory gift would probably be seen as quite offensive by halflings


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
No one "demands" the halflings pay the gift, the lord lets it be known this has happened, and hopes for the best


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
Right but the idea of giving the lord a present on the birth of the heir, if the lord has been a huge boon to the local halfling community would not be weird at all


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
And might also be quite substantial


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
no, of course not, it could be vastly more than what you would expect


[1/5/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
this all plays into the lottery idea. if you keep the hallings that pass through your land happy and safe, then when your heir is born maybe you'll get something truly huge


[1/5/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
The only other source of money I have that would be very offensive to halflings is the idea of local monopolies


[1/5/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
and the story about how the lord of such-place's son got a dozen horses for a wedding gift from some halflings he'd never even met before travels far and wide (probably in part helped by halflings themselves)

{Reactions}
üëç

[1/5/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah halflings would just basically ignore those


[1/5/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
Probably one of the few things that would cause true conflict; if some lord's main source of incoming is the local monopoly on brewing, and a hafling decides to open a brewery/inn in the same town, the lord might not really have any good options


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but of course the halflings would know this, and although they should feel chaotic it isn't totally capricious


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
But I suspect that is quite rare, as these types of monopolies are usually on stuff like milling, brewing, bakehouses, etc not say "selling glassware"


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right. But that's how they punish the grandson of the lord who didn't let them build an inn without punishing the whole town


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
So to the poor grandson, maybe it really does seem capricious because he doesn't know that his grandfather refused a halfling deal


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
But that all works well, I think


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
it is caprcious to the humans but not the halflings


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
I think dwarves and local monopolies is more interesting; what I have in my notes is that the dwarves are given permission to ignore the local monopoly as long as they don't sell to humans. To me, that seems reasonable, but not sure your thoughts


[1/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i think dwarves are the most likely of any non-human race to have substantial "dwarven quarters" in human cities and towns


[1/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
so that does have a certain logic


[1/5/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i think depending on the size of the local dwarven community you'd have a variety of arrangements, but that feels like a plausible option


[1/5/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right. It isn't one size fits all on the Sembaran side either, a lot depends on the specific baron and duchy and lord


[1/5/2024 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i also think it is worth keeping in mind a little rare species like elves, centaurs, stoneborn, various fey, etc. they are rare enough that this is mostly going to be kind of one-off arrangements


[1/5/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
which would mostly exist outside of typical human rules and understanding


[1/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think there are no "general rules" outside of lizardfolk/halflings/dwarves.


[1/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
And even for halflings there are probably no laws, more folklore and word of mouth about how to best deal with them


[1/5/2024 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/7/2024 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus

- understands Obsidian markdown natively so can go from processed vault -> html directly as a Github Action
- includes decent search, backlinks, popover previews, a number of other nice features
- heavily used in the Obsidian community if r/obsidianmd is accurate
Cons:
- written in TypeScript so fancy customization requires writing TypeScript (e.g., getting Leaflet to work or something)
- does not have nearly the ecosystem of themes and plugins that other static site generators have

Option 2: Material for mkdocs, Hugo, Jekyll or another "big" static site generator
https://github.com/collections/static-site-generators
Pros:
- usually have big communities, lots of themes/plugins, comprehensive documentation for setting up on Github Pages
- similar to the build process for my lab website so have some experience with this setup

Cons:
- would require some markdown cleanup to convert obsidian-flavored markdown to something else, including injection of backlinks and other 'obsidian-ish' content worth preserving
- requires some searching/optimizing to figure out the best option among a number of possibilities

Option 3: Obsidian

[1/9/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Option 3 coming


[1/9/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Option 3: Obsidian Digital Garden
something like https://dg-docs.ole.dev/
Pros:


[1/9/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Pros:
- build entirely as an obsidian plugin; potentially supports dataview and other complex things like that

Cons:
- build entirely as an obsidian plugin, so it can be kind of annoying to modify, extend, etc.


[1/9/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Another con:
- requires tagging notes to be published


[1/9/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
On a quick peak, Quartz seems promising


[1/9/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
I don't love a solution inside obsidian, as I suspect it is the hardest to make work, and is probably highly tied to the obsidian UI


[1/9/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
Typescript is just Javascript with some nice bits, so it is not a stretch from the existing script code-base


[1/9/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
Quartz also can use rehype/remark plugins although I don't know what that is


[1/9/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
It might be worth looking at how hard getting something like leaflet to work is


[1/9/2024 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
Lots of good lore drops there.


[1/9/2024 8:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I thought you'd appreciate that


[1/9/2024 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
Helpful to know the stuff I know out of game in game üòÄ



[1/28/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at various status/tim things. 

on Avatus: don't have strong feelings human vs hobgoblin; feel free to choose, or he could be something else entirely. 

I think the exact history of where this dominion came from can probably be left a bit unclear. 

I do think the vibe kind of suggests that in the aftermath of the fall of Drankor, Sembara is a bit of a backwater, initially. Especially once the Dunmari arrive in late 1100s and clear up the lingering curse, you have a pretty powerful set of realms from Cymea - Isingue - Dunmar - Chardon. 

The Skaer in a more raiding phase, and the Dominion of Avatus, really kind of hem in Sembara pre-Derik I.


[1/28/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
Yes; definitely think his dominion origination unclear for now; I do think the breakup of a fairly large autocracy is a good way to expand Sembara without "conqueoring" in the usual sense, so I like Avatus stretching basically from the mountains to Tyrwingha


[1/28/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
and Maseau/Addermarch/western Sembara comes from the collapse


[1/28/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so it does play a bit into the human/hobgoblin/other decision, to think a bit about whether the reconquest is liberating basically still intact populated areas that were ruled by Avatus, or resettling depopulated areas?


[1/28/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
of course viable to have either option for human or hobgoblin or something else


[1/28/2024 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i might actually be inclined to make Avatus a bit more unique/powerful in his own right than just human/hobgoblin, but without making him fantastic enough that it feels weird his unusual nature hasn't come up


[1/28/2024 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
I'm inclined to leave his exact nature somewhat undefined. He clearly has hobgoblins working for him, but I think he had motivations that were not exactly just pure destruction and murder


[1/28/2024 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that seems right


[1/28/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
At the same time, I think violence depopulates a place pretty rapidly.  So for practical purposes, I think a Maseau, for example, ends up being a "new" place after Avatus. If the deep history of Maseau ever matters, it probably isn't the case that there were literally no humans then when Avatus was defeated. But at the same time, the political structures were imposed by Derik I as part of the foundation of Sembara


[1/28/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
imposed is probably the wrong word - received gracefully. And then it became a land of a lot of new settlement


[1/28/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
So by the time of the Great War, Maseau and the other "new" duchies in Sembara are pretty Sembaran.


[1/28/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
But also, I guess, pretty Sembaran only in the sense of loyal to the House of Sewick


[1/28/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
so when things start to fall apart after the Great War, there is a distinct sense of place for Maseau


[1/28/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean it depends a bit on Avatus' motives. if he needs agricultural productivity, he is going to reign in his armies and make sure they don't massacre the peasants


[1/28/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, people will still flee


[1/28/2024 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, not sure it matters too much


[1/28/2024 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think what I'm actually trying to say is that whatever political entity did or did not exist pre-Avatus is functionally irrelevant post-Avatus. Maseau and other parts of western/borderland Sembara probably are generic "Sembaran/Drankorian" types, with fewer than usual Zimka/kestavo influences with a somewhat irrevelvant pre-Avatus history


[1/28/2024 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, agreed


[1/28/2024 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
I do think there is probably some sense of culture/people that is distinct from the heartland duchies


[1/28/2024 6:25 PM] .deciusmus
And so Derik I basically creates a new Duchy of Maseau where the duke is loyal to Sewick and declares a bunch of the land part of the royal demense and then leaves the Duke to run the place similar to how the dukes run the heartland duchies


[1/28/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the main semi-canon effects of Avatus are whatever you've introduced in your campaign, and the idea that the edge of the Sentinels west of Isingue remains something of a wildlands, a place where hobgoblins and other nasty things linger. you have e.g. Revaka three generations later, and then the various hobgoblin attacks / armies in the high school campaign


[1/28/2024 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so Avatus is kind of a useful placeholder there - defeated, but not every bit of his army wiped from the earth


[1/28/2024 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes I agree that the pre-Avatus political structures become irrelevant post-Avatus


[1/28/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
I imagine somewhat of a gradient, the upper Isatoros watershed is probably still pretty dangerous until post-Great War, when the shifting plaguelands prevent travel from going south via Isingue


[1/28/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. in 1500 you'd have a major trade route running via Urlich Pass and another running south from Cleenseau -> Maseau -> Isingue


[1/28/2024 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
but say, Raven's Hold is probably pretty marginal/doesn't exist/definitely isn't on a human trade road


[1/28/2024 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
Post Great War things shift as Urlich is destroyed (the impact of that I think was pretty brutal, it probably pretty much entirely depopulated the Duchy of Brovna, which I was envisioning as one of the richest duchies, sitting in Urlich / trade center  etc)


[1/28/2024 6:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Ravens Hold is originally constructed as part of a series of defenses in northern dunmar against hobgoblin activity pre-Great War


[1/28/2024 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
right, that fits the above perfectly


[1/28/2024 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
although I guess also with Ardith still intact the heart of the mountains were probably safer


[1/28/2024 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Below the mountains, yes. But I think the foothills were pretty dangerous


[1/28/2024 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
but the sweep of land where the Reofounded Alliance of Aurbez is now would have been pretty dangerous as well, I imagine


[1/28/2024 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes. Ardith would have been pretty fortified as well


[1/28/2024 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, in my "grand sweep of Sembaran history v2" I'm basically imagining, with the fall of Avatus, a series of powerful duchies established along the borders - Maseau and Brovna, in particular - which is a big expansion in the size of sembara and a big centralization of power as these duchies are much more under the control of the monarch than the traidtional duchies


[1/28/2024 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
added a few small notes to the human funerary traditions page, but generally would say it is good


[1/29/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
You have a misaligned SECRET tag in Drankoran Empire page


[1/30/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed the updated funeral stuff


[1/30/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
The tyrwingha page is still a bit vague but the rest I think is done


[1/31/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
I'm trying to clean up my Cleenseau NPCs because my players have started asking if random people they met 4 sessions ago are still around...

So I was trying to find all the people who are in Cleenseau, includingthe people I've created without whereabouts...

Do you have concerns if I set simple whereabouts on some people, i.e. 

Adam Gower = Tollen
Yelena = Ursk
etc?


[2/1/2024 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
nope that is fine


[2/1/2024 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
btw my next game is Sunday, was hoping to use the funeral stuff, if you get a chance to look would be great


[2/1/2024 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
also I just pushed a few comments on funerary traditions - nothing major basically look great to me

[2/1/2024 1:24 PM] .deciusmus
one note, the Drankor stuff I wrote for my own background but is not something I'm going to publish. I intended it to be "canonical inspiration for Sembara" but not necessarily a canonical representation of what Drankorians actually did

{Reactions}
üëç

[2/1/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
I did one more pass through what I wrote, and updated the Tyrwingha page. Mostly reorganization, so there is a page in "Brainstorming" for ideas. I moved some of your notes into brainstorming or incorporated into the body of the text.

Will likely publish tomorrow after I do a little bit of NPC cleanup


[2/1/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
If you get a chance the main thing to look at would be Tyrwingha


[2/1/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it all looks good. i might at some point flesh out in a bit more detail some of the religious history, both the northern folk religions and the dunmari have a basic framework of "we need to help ensure the soul gets to the land of the dead but then the gods take over" vs mos numena "the gods will make sure the soul makes it to the land of the dead, but we need to help with the journey"


[2/1/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in terms of actual metaphysics both transitions are potentially fraught


[2/1/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is probably the case that the small gods of the northern folk religions (which also probably represent the original human religious tradition, more or less) actually do have more desire/capacity to shepherd souls, as they have always seemed more physically real than the more archetypal gods (mos numena, kaikkea)


[2/1/2024 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah. I assume that both transitions are technically fraught, but that the religious traditions developed in part because the gods actually do (mostly) do the things people think they do


[2/1/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
well there is probably something of a feedback loop as well


[2/1/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
It seems wrong to me that Drankor or Sembara would develop a totally false belief that the gods handle the sheparding of the soul into the land of the dead, if there wasn't some real truth to it.

I mean, presumably the reason all this stuff happens is because a group of humans with no death traditions at all, who just didn't bother, would in fact by plagued by ghosts and the like


[2/1/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[2/1/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that the basic idea is that the gods do the best they can but are fundamentally not omnipotent outside their own realms. 

death traditions are a way of amplifying the gods power and filling in gaps, in a sense.


[2/1/2024 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but also different gods have different strengths in some metaphysical sense. the small gods are, well, small, and so there is some sense that an individual god actually reaches into the land of the dead and follows/protects souls on the journey. but they don't have a lot of power on the material plane. 

mos numena has a lot of power so easier to protect the transition to the land of the dead, but then have a bit less influence, etc


[2/1/2024 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
none of this set in stone, just noodling a bit


[2/1/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I like the direction


[2/1/2024 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the general religious history idea is basically you start with small gods that are somewhat weak individually but which can intecede with arhat and malik on your behalf, but they are kind of like a personal protector. so if they can find your soul they can protect it. 

then you have kind of a variety of transitional forms, eventually culmunating in urban Hkar tradition that becomes mos numena, where the gods are these strong, powerful archetypes, with tons of power to grant miracles, but much less personal.



[2/2/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i pushed a religious history of taelgar brainstorming page that tries to centralize some of the strands/ideas about development of human religion on hkar and the impact on extant religious traditions


[2/2/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
I really like that as a general history. It seems to pull together the metaphysical underpinings of a lot of the strains of thought elsewhere and feels like it fits pretty well


[2/2/2024 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
I like the idea that Mos Numena develops by basically the process of re-definition of other gods as archetypes of a "bigger" god, which is a good explanation for how it becomes dominant


[2/2/2024 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
Somewhat unclear is an answer to how demons, devils, celestials, etc came into being


[2/2/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
There is the early idea (i.e. that Thandros expressed when we were hunting the gnolls) that human belief in hell created hell, but the mechanism of how it works in the context of the broad sweep of religious history is a little unclear


[2/2/2024 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i think on the one hand, this probably doesn't need a strictly canonical answer, there can be lots of ideas floating around in-game


[2/2/2024 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I didn't mean to suggest we need a strictly canonical answer


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
What  I really like about the doc you wrote is it provides a pretty solid working history which can be refered to make new things "fit" without being precisely prespective


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
however, i was trying to also set up the thread of the outer planes with the idea that, until the development of early pantheonic religions, there is no conception of gods having a home in the spiritual realms


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
they are manifestations of divine energy and conduits of divine energy that exist on the material plane


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but, that doesn't mean that no spiritual realms exist in this era


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
But in that context, I was noting that it doesn't help much with the worldbuilding challenge of "what's the background of this demon"


[2/2/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
Right. That makes sense, although I'm not sure I got it from the page


[2/2/2024 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i think this could be fleshed out more but one challenge is that i'm not sure what outer planes should exist in taelgar


[2/2/2024 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
canonically we have nine hells, abyss, pandemonium, arborea, and an unnamed prison dimension from the philosopher's guild note about the binding stones


[2/2/2024 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
(in addition to the realms of the gods)


[2/2/2024 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
but there could and probably will be more


[2/2/2024 2:08 PM] .deciusmus
This is where I feel like metaphysics helps. I feel like the fairly well-established metaphysics of the human religions helps clarify, for example, what the "right answer" is to an in-game question about what's going on at abandoned kestavo shrine that appears to be haunted.


[2/2/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
There doesn't need to be a deep and firm set of rules, but the skeleton makes it a lot easier to make up a consistent answer.


[2/2/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like that is kinda missing from the outer realms


[2/2/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
Not saying it has to be created now or anything, but its a gap in the Taelgar-ian metaphysics


[2/2/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, agreed. i kind of feel like it needs a bit more in-game exposure before it can be consolidated into metaphysics, though. 2025 is likely to involve a huge amount of extraplanar exploration in game so an answer might become clearer in 18 months


[2/2/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
I was about to say something similar, but with the added point that I'm pretty confident our game will get to outer plane stuff somewhat / long before my game does


[2/2/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
I expect to eventually be doing a fair bit with the Far Realms and weird abberations and stuff, but we are averaging ~10 sessions/year (6-7 hour in person sessions, so about twice the length of a DuFr session) so its probably more like late 2025/2026 (when we get to the last arc of my game)


[2/2/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
the far realms feels easier in a way since they are explicitly weird and alien and in some ways it is probably better if there isn't obvious rules or metaphysics that one can derive


[2/2/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
That is also true


[2/2/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
Although just because the danger is on the far realm doesn't mean that the solution isn't somewhere else


[2/2/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
true. 

separately though, i do think one more obvious question that is raised by the history i've sketched out and might be easier to answer now is what happens to the souls of Deno'qai, Zimka, etc. since the small gods don't inhabit spiritual realms, where do they go?


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
probably this is the same answer as where do the souls of people who died before the development of pantheonic religions go


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
one obvious option is reincarnation, but i'm not sure that is correct


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
I actually liked your answer of "beyond the veil"


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
Is there a need for a canonical answer?


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess probably not


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
I guess there are some implications, i.e. to Speak with Dead, Ressurection


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
if the soul is reincarnated, do those even work?


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
not so much speak with dead which doesn't summon the soul back to the body


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes ressurcetion would be impacted


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess speak with dead just animates the body to speak its experiences


[2/2/2024 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is best if there isn't one specific answer


[2/2/2024 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
I definitely don't think the Zimka believe in reincarnation, and I think in general in Taelgar most religious beliefs should align at least somewhat with metaphysical truths. But it seems useful to have enough flexibility in the metaphysics that a culture where reincarnation is true could exist (although it would probably have to be a small gods culture)


[2/2/2024 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the soul manifests where it goes


[2/2/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i would actually argue the opposite. a religion where souls are reincarnated would likely be a pantheonic religion where, rather than creating souls out of whatever to give people life, the gods send back souls in their domain


[2/2/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
^ yeah, fair point. That could certainly work as well


[2/2/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
But I was thinking of an ancestory worshipping, small gods religion where each soul is carried from the land of the dead to a new birth


[2/2/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
directly


[2/2/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the "default" metaphysics is that it is a one way journey, where souls are created out of ~divinity~ somehow (left completely mysterious) and then return to ~divinity~ in some way after passing through the land of the dead, but there is a lot of flexibilty for belief and for deities to reshape this


[2/2/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
How does this relate to the Plane of Souls/Plane of Consicousness?


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
not entirely clear, although plane of souls is some kind of manifestation of living souls only


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
it is basically the psionic equivalent of the plane of magic in some sense


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but fully on the "material plane" side of the land of the dead


[2/2/2024 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
right


[2/2/2024 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the distinction between primal realms and divine realms in my notes is kind of obselete. the basic idea is that the spiritual realms are divided into the proximate realms (dreamworld, plane of souls, astral plane, whatever else) and the outer planes, and those are divided by the land of the dead


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
i haven't quite worked out the metaphysics of like astral projection and such, and whether you can actually reach the outer planes from the astral plane, etc

where does primal magic come from?


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
and in some sense the plane of souls, astral plane, and the dreamworld might all be kind of part of the same metaphysical thing


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
the material plane


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
makes sense


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
primal magic is the echoes of the riving


[2/2/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
there is probably also a connection with fey magic to an extent, since metaphysically the echo realms (shadowfell, feywild, mirror realm so far) are effectively part of the material plane


[2/2/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
at some point someone will play a druid and i'll flesh some of this out in more detail


[2/2/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually so far everyone who has played a druid has just basically played a nature cleric with their magic as flavored as coming from gods, no one has actually played a metaphyiscally primal magic user


[2/2/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe i need to introduce a druid npc for a bit


[2/2/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I was going to say one of my players in the Ausson's Crossing miniseries played a dwarven druid, but he decided his magic came from the Baharazel


[2/2/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Where did Kyr's magic come from? Wasn't he "druidish"


[2/2/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
You need a human druid


[2/2/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, why does the (somewhat odd) D&D rule of primal magic actually have to exist in Taelgar? It isn't crazy to think that all magic is either divine or arcane, and a druid player basically chooses whether they are ultimately channeling the plane of magic or divine magi


[2/2/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, maybe. kyr's magic eventually ended up coming from the plane of consciousness in some sense, although metaphysics have shifted a bit since then


[2/4/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i assume you have no particular attachment to any particular details of this:
" In 1550, Rumors of an endless horde of orcs, and worse, reach Embry from Vostok in this time, and an embassy from several of the Vostok chieftains arrives, but is turned back with only a company of knights to support it, none of whom ever return to Sembara. But whatever chaos consumes the north, little of it reaches the Volta, save for rumors. But Jane and Bertram drop the title ‚ÄúHigh King of Vostok‚Äù from the royal titles and Vostok turns inward for its defenses. "


[2/4/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
no, none


[2/5/2024 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
were you changing that?


[2/5/2024 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
I presume you were working on backstory of vostok for the upcoming session

If you are tweaking the map at some point, can you expand the woods you drew near Cleenseau to include the bit in yellow?

Great South Road:

An ancient road that runs from [[Embry]] to [[Cassons]]. In better days it ran south as far as [[Isingue]], and in the Drankorian era, was said to continue almost 2500 miles to [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] itself.

Although in poor repair in some places, for much of it's length it is paved with wide, smooth stones with drainage ditches on both sides. According to legend many of the stones in the road are a thousand years old, and have never cracked.

----

I'm working on some answers to my player's questions that depend on whether or not the Great South Road is in fact super-good road for travel, any concerns with the above?


[2/7/2024 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
no this is good, it should be semi-magical probably in places


[2/11/2024 9:27 AM] rsulfuratus
looking at your Sembara/lich email, a few thoughts. 

one thing that is not entirely clear to me is how much of this is supposed to be common knowledge in 1749. don't have to settle it all that soon but i think it shades how I think about some of the events you describe, and also might end up being relevant if the Dunmar group starts asking around about how to kill a lich


[2/11/2024 9:28 AM] rsulfuratus
so for example, "Battle of Something between Tollen and Sembara in 1720" fits in a lot better in the current 1749 vibe if it is widely known to be during the "lich interregnum"


[2/11/2024 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
I am definitely envisioning that the Lich interregnum is widely known


[2/11/2024 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
Some of the deeper plotting (ie relationship@with Umbraeth) probably secret and everyone would think the lich was totally defeated in summer 1720


[2/11/2024 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
Also when it started maybe not super clear.


[2/11/2024 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
But the six months from Jan - June 1720 would be widely known as ‚Äúlich interregnum‚Äù basically from when the dead arose from the ground in winter 1720 until when he was defeated in summer 1720


[2/11/2024 9:33 AM] rsulfuratus
right, okay


[2/11/2024 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
so I think what you describe fits fine with my feelingn about future history, then. the one thing I might say is that it might be slightly nicer to structure this as largely involving the south/west, and less tollen/highlanders, unless it is the only way to drive your players to tollen and you want them to go there


[2/11/2024 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
the reason is that this is the period of tollen expansion when e.g. there are pirate wars and tollen starts establishing dominance over western cymea


[2/11/2024 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
which works best if sembara sees tollen as a safe ally


[2/11/2024 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
but of course a short blip is fine if needed for your campaign


[2/11/2024 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
I don‚Äôt really want my players to be interested in Tollen right now. Post lich they might go there to investigate backstory (still working on who the lich is and where he came from)


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
I just wanted a second thrust to the plan for background. My players are invested in the ‚ÄúEnst river valley‚Äù pretty heavily so Wisford as a major center is perfect


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
But I don‚Äôt want it to feel like ‚Äúwisford vs the rest of sembara‚Äù


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
one option to change the tollen vibe a bit and perhaps play into tollen history is to have the lich intentionally to a terrible job dealing with piracy on the western gulf


[2/11/2024 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
that would be bad for telham and other coastal powers. maybe even telham is blamed for piracy


[2/11/2024 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
sembara has never been a major naval power but if piracy is growing as a problem in the early 1700s they are probably not completely ignoring it. until the lich, and maybe that provides the opening for tollen to be seen as a savior and end up really dominant


[2/11/2024 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
a thought, anyway


[2/11/2024 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
might even be a way to try to get one of the more coastal powers to raise their own army and then declare them a traitor for it as a second front


[2/11/2024 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
The other idea I had was the zimka it is just less made up. But for example the lich could claim the reason the dead are rising has something to do with the baleful influence of the lingering kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
Which sets up a conflict along the north/west border as a second front (and gives me an excuse to inject some kestavo lore into the game)


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, that works too. actually i think the "night queen has withdrawn her favor" seems a little hard to pull off, since it isn't like actual clerics would notice and feels big enough the gods would kind of push back a little? not directly but at least in dreams or whatever


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
so blaming foreign gods seems a lot easier for the lich to make work


[2/11/2024 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
although if you convince the people the elders of the night queen are lying, then it works better


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but it does seem like a riskier plan for the lich than blaming kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
Right I was envisionig the night queen thing leading with the lich executing a group of 8 or so elders of the night queen


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
But it does seem risky. The kestavo is probably a sounder plan


[2/11/2024 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
And more disruptive to sembara as well as it plays to natural tensions in society rather than trying to create new ones


[2/11/2024 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
that is a pretty good campaign hook for the campaign that the adventurers who end up killing the lich are part of: you start the campaign with everyone having a dream from the night queen summoning them on the quest


[2/11/2024 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
but i would probably go with kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
In the kestavo world it‚Äôs probably  one of the coastal dukes who‚Äôs secretly in league with the lich, and one of the highland dukes (chemin or arnsbury) who ends up revolting perhaps after an attempted/partially successful crackdown on kestavo.


[2/11/2024 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the Duke of Seham is the main Lich plant, and mismanages the pirates (maybe even secretly helping) with the goal of keeping Tollen occupied


[2/11/2024 9:58 AM] .deciusmus
So it isn‚Äôt that the lich wants conflict with Tollen, he just wants Tollen to be busy and to feel slighted by Sembara so aid from Tollen is more grudging, etc


[2/12/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
have you given much thought to lizardfolk family structure?


[2/12/2024 6:26 PM] .deciusmus
Also did you ever decide Vahiaya level/character class? They might show up leading a group of rangers soon in my game


[2/12/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
And I might need stats. I can just make something up if you didn't have ideas


[2/12/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
had some conversations with Eric about lizardfolk family structure - he played a lizardfolk in the Kenzo solo who was taking care of two babies. but we didn't decide much that was cannon, except a vague sense that a) they probably don't give live birth; b) the young at a very early age are probably mostly aquatic, but unclear when this stage ends, and unclear if this is like a tadpole stage or actual baby lizardfolk. 

from Eric's Mawar character have the sense that at least some lizardfolk have fairly traditional nuclear families at some point


[2/12/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Vahiaya - did not give much thought to a class, but figured probably mostly a martial - either straight fighter or a ranger. does not feel like a paladin to me


[2/12/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like having family structures and biology being (potentially, somewhat) more complex than "standard nuclear family like 1950s humans" for species - one of my players had a few ideas he was mucking around with (generically, not specifically for Taelgar) which struck me as potentially somewhat interesting for lizardfolk


[2/12/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking ranger


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems reasonable. only level constraint would be that in 1749 they are significantly weaker than you, so like 7-9th level at that point, if not lower


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
I was going with 3rd-5th


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
Haven't figured out hich is best


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
seems good


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
But they retire soon after the undead stuff


[2/12/2024 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
5th level in 1749 fine too, doesn't really matter to me


[2/12/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
don't necessarily disagree - my only pushback would be I don't want other species to end up in a situation where you need to read 5 pages of lore to play them "properly"


[2/12/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. Anyway not really something I was thinking about much, just offhand. Mostly trying to organize all the undead stuff and plan out a few things for my next session.


[3/6/2024 9:06 AM] .deciusmus
What do you think of Vahaiya as a 5th level fighter (arcane archer) specialized in bow, high dex, medium int/str, lowish wis/cha


[3/6/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
Sure


[3/12/2024 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
playing around with the new character reference option in midjourney. a younger Vahaiya, as a ranger

I have one player who can't make the Easter game, so the PCs are splitting up, with 3 of them going to Rinberg to investigate a monster that is dwelling in a lake near there, the other one going back to Cleenseau to bring news. He also might not be able to make April 28 in which case I am going to drag out the Rinberg adventure. If he can make APril 28, that would be the "Back in Cleenseau" and investigating fey stuff with Vahaiya game


[3/12/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
If he can't, it would be June 2

[3/15/2024 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
been doing a little bit of NPC note cleanup, in part motivated by the cref option in midjourney making it easier to update old images to better quality new ones, which has motivated me to reorganize status tags a bit. 

curious what you feel the most useful things to track are and what is most important to be "canonical/shared" vs what we can use independently.

so far I am working from the following things I want to track, although this may be too fine grained and some of these can be combined:

## Needs Header Work or Reformatting

1) pages with complete text, but that need header information filled in from session notes or timelines (typically whereabouts and/or campaign info)
2) pages with complete text, but have complications that cannot be fully captured with the current header setup (e.g. a person who the party met as a ghost/undead but also has information about their past life)
3) pages with complete text, but which is not in the most useful format (e.g., history pages that would be better reorganized as a timeline)

## Needs Text

4) pages that need work on the text, where crucial details remain to be invented and so should not be considered complete
5) pages that need work on the text, where crucial details need to be copied from DM notes, session notes, or other notes

## Needs Verification / Validation

6) pages that need to be fact checked against other canonical information
7) pages with a name that needs consideration before it is considered canonical
8) pages that need a look over from someone else

## Other

9) pages that it would be nice to have an image or images for
10) empty pages that need basic header information
11) empty pages that need actual text


[3/15/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
some of these we already have good tags for (6 - status/factcheck, 7 - status/namecheck, 8 - status/tim, status/mike)


[3/15/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
9 - status/image
10 - status/stub


[3/15/2024 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
currently status/refactor is kind of both 2+3, and I'd like to split it to status/refactor (2) and status/reformat (3)


[3/15/2024 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
both status/internal and status/collate basically represent 1, and are used inconsistently. I would replace with status/header (or similar) to represent pages that are missing header details


[3/15/2024 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I would propose:
- status/blankslate for 11
- status/needswork for 4+5; probably don't need to distinguish, but if we want to, could use status/needswork/<> where <> could be notes, internal, wip (for "non-Obsidian info", "Obsidian info", "needs invention")


[3/15/2024 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also argue that status tags don't make sense for Campaigns and Worldbuilding, excepting maybe Worldbuilding/Background


[3/15/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I think the main thing id suggest is to try for 2 levels with the 2nd level optional


[3/15/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôd don‚Äôt care as much about the fine grained stuff as you


[3/15/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
For me the main things are:
The page needs work or invention
This page is mostly complete but needs some ‚Äúcleanup‚Äù
This page is basically just a name placeholder


[3/15/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder if something like
Status/cleanup
Status/needswork
Status/stub

And then sub levels like
Status/cleanup/facts
Status/cleanup/header 
Etc


[3/15/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
Cleanup means ‚Äúreasonable complete, should be considered canonicalish‚Äù


[3/15/2024 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
Needswork means ‚Äúmissing large gaps. The information here is still being developed‚Äù


[3/15/2024 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, okay, that works well


[3/15/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
Stub means: this is an empty page, I (the creator of the page) don‚Äôt really have any ideas about it other than the name


[3/15/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
Then keep factcheck namecheck mike tim as separate


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so the top level would be:
stub
factcheck
namecheck
mike
tim
cleanup
needswork


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
that works for me


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
oh, also, I'd like to add a status/image as a toplevel tag


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Why not status/cleanup/image?


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don‚Äôt care either way


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
running stuff through midjourney is very easy to do when I'm e.g. on a boring meeting on Zoom


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so to me it feels pretty distinct from other cleanup tasks


[3/15/2024 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, either way


[3/15/2024 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
which typically involve collating information across notes which involves a lot more concentration


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
do you know of a way to get the word count of a note in dataview or dataviewJS? I want to make a query to find highly linked notes with litte/no text


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'm sure there is a way to do it in js


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
but I don't know offhand


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe I will poke around a bit

there are a lot of things tagged "status/stub" that have complete headers but no other text. I think these are left over from old uses of stub, as by the current definition stub should mean "this page needs a header". I am planning on removing the stub tag from pages with complete headers, even if they have litte/no text, unless you object


[3/15/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
I think it might be worth reviewing to make sure status/stub doesn't need to be status/needswork


[3/15/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. Duchy of Wisford should be status/needswork, not status/stub


[3/15/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
whereas The Salty Squid is probably just "remove the tag" unless you have some notes on the place


[3/15/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
things that also have status/unknown fine to just remove


[3/15/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
it would really only be a page that has ONLY status/stub where it is obviously something that should have more info


[3/15/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
I am actually trying to just clear all the status/stub pages by adding headers to things that are missing them, and then adding status/needswork as relevant

[3/15/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
the reason for the note lenght query is to have an independent check for "short notes that are marked as complete" so I can go back and add status/needswork to ones that are important enough to need text


[3/15/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
right, makes sense


[3/15/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
Do you think that there are more fey (i.e. dryads, satyrs, etc) living on Taelgar in Tyrwingha than other places? Or do you think its more one way, i.e. there are a lot of portals, but mostly that means humans -> feywild more than fey -> Tyrwingha?


[3/15/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't really thought about it. but probably yes

the "status/unknown" ones are a bit more daunting, as there are ~750 of them, but many are in campaign directories where status tags aren't really useful

[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed an update to Tyrwingha... would be interested in your opinoin. Also here:

Tyrwingha is a rural place, with no cities of any size outside of [[Tafolwern]], and most people live in small villages and market towns of between 50 and 1000 people. 

Unlike in [[Sembara]], where themanor  is the main unit of political organization, Tyrwingha is fundamentally organized, from the bottom, around the village, and from the top, around the earls. 

In ancient days, the title of Earl was said to be bestowed only on those human lords who had sworn a direct oath to [[Archfey Ethlenn]] to serve and obey her, and were thus seen as her stewards in the human realms, watching over the land and its inhabitants on her behalf. Today, these earls, of which there are about fifty, are powerful lords, whose bond to Ethlenn derives from their allegiance to the monarch. The earls have a duty to watch over the land on behalf of Ethlenn, and usually they spend at least six months of the year travelling with their retainers and court.


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Each earl has a circuit, which they ride, and a set of villages and towns on that circuit, for which they are responsible. The earl is obligated to provide, to their villages and towns, justice, defense, and charity. The villages are obligated to provide to the earl, labor service. This labor service is traditionally a year of labor for every ten hearths in the village. This can take many forms: in some cases, it is someone joining the earl's travelling court, or the Army of Mostreve. In other cases, it is working the earl's land, in which it is more usually divided up, i.e. six people working the land during harvest and planting, rather than one person for a whole year.

The earl, in turn, is responsible for providing to each village:
* Justice, in the form of appeals from the village Court of All (see below)
* Defense, via their own force of arms, and their retainers
* Charity, in the form of support in hard times, managing the redistribution of food and so on


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Villages are usually self-organized, and the Sembaran model of a manoral lord who oversees the village is not typically seen in Tyrwingha (although a small number of Sembaran style manors do exist along the Aure and the border with Sembara).

Village organization is varied, but all villages manage disputes via the Court of All. This is a village gathering that is empowered to judge and punish crimes, settle disputes between neighbors, and make decisions about how the village will fulfil its labor service to Ethlenn and the earl's.

The Court of All is consisted as an assembly of the village, with one representative for each hearth. So the very poor have no representation, and the wealthy somewhat disproportionate representation, but in many villages there are neither wealthy nor poor, and the general vibe is usually fairly democratic.


[3/17/2024 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
was away from my computer all afternoon yesterday, looking at this now


[3/17/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
I would make a few subtle tweaks. 

I think that the fundamental relationship with Ethlenn is less about land (e.g., I'm not sure it makes sense to say that all land in Tyrwingha is held in trust for Ethlenn), and more about obligations of service and protection. 

I like the way you've set up earls, but I'd frame it more explicitly like almost a fey bargain. Ethlenn has offerred her protection over the land, and in turn asks for service from the people.

I kind of imagine that long ago, before Drankor, this was more explicitly about a bargain between the people and Ethlenn, and the service might often involve someone spending a year in the feywild. 

Subsequently, this has evolved, and the earls kind of function like a stand-in. 

I think this is the vibe you were going for, yes?

But the land holding stuff doesn't really fit to me, since it would be weird for a fey lord to have an interest in *land* on the material plane, imo.


[3/17/2024 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense. It is the vibe I was going for.


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
But I also wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to pull in the full complexity of sembaran land holdings. In particular I like the distinction of not being so based around manors, and being more based on service obligations than taxes on land


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
But I agree the ‚ÄúEthlenn owns the land‚Äù is probably the wrong vibe


[3/17/2024 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
I think I would just basically make all land in Tyrwinghan effectively what Sembarans would call folkland


[3/17/2024 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
except that since there is no taxation on land, there is no reason you can't sell it


[3/17/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
the Court of All in a village is responsible for, among other things, land records and deeds, and so you get a bit of a New England town hall vibe where the village can block a sale they don't want, which tends to make villages a bit insular I guess


[3/17/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
I like that actually though


[3/17/2024 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think it works. so basically you have the following:
- a somewhat feudal relationship with Ethlenn, which is based on obligations of service and protection, although practically speaking the earls serve as a stand in for Ethlenn, and claim the service obligations and provide protection (although, there are probably cases in Tywinghan common law where an earl was unable to get the service from a particular village some year because they had instead done something directly for Ethlenn; there might be some tie in with the army and warlocks here)
- a fairly "modern" concept of private property rights
- a heavily rural, village based society where the Court of All controls a lot of aspects of life in a village, with kind of a New England town hall vibe, which probably means there can be a lot of village-to-village variability


[3/17/2024 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus
Left unsaid are how earls are chosen. Are these hereditary nobility now? I guess yes, although perhaps would be worth considering some variants


[3/17/2024 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
My thinking is that technically, like the electors, the earls are supposed to be put forward by the existing body of earls and accepted by Ethlenn


[3/17/2024 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
But in practice, silence is interpreted as acceptance and so mostly children follow parents.  But it‚Äôs formally an elected position where the existing earls are the electors


[3/17/2024 10:36 AM] .deciusmus
So there is some variability especially when an earl dies unexpectedly, ie before having had a chance to have their heir officially selected


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
(The idea being that ‚Äúearls heir‚Äù is a position in its own right, and most earls will arrange for their chosen heir to be elected as the earl-in-waiting before they die)


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think that works


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
But occasionally Ethlenn actually does intervene, and other times politics intervenes, so it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúby right‚Äù that the position inherits like it is in sembara


[3/17/2024 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
What is relationship between earls and the crown?


[3/17/2024 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm‚Ä¶ I think the earls should be subservient to the crown but kinda forgot about the crown in the above


[3/17/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
One possible history could be that originally (pre-Drankor), you just had earls, no crown. The earls were basically Ethenn‚Äôs court on the material plane


[3/17/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
Then in the deal with Drankor, ethenn creates the royal electors, at this point the advisors to drankor or whatever who have to formally approve whoever is proposed for governor of the province


[3/17/2024 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
The earls still exist and are fairly independent of the Drankorian hierarchy


[3/17/2024 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
Part of the deal, perhaps, is that certain matter of local organization are devolved to the earls still


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Maybe in the early days post Drankor the monarch is actually quite weak, and the power of the monarch kind of depends on the extent to which the monarch is seen as the actual representative of Ethlenn on the material plane


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Formally speaking the monarch is always supposed to be that


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
So earls would owe allegiance kind of analogously to a reagent


[3/17/2024 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
I like that so far‚Ä¶


[3/17/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
could even imagine that the early tales of the earls of Tyrwingha have a bit of a "knights of the round table" vibe, with Ethlenn as the king arthur standin. Maybe "earl" is actually an old Tyrwinghan word for knight

{Reactions}
üëç

[3/17/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
I think this would imply that the earls are kind of an independent power base; it is only the assumption/belief that Ethlenn will directly intervene to keep things from going too far off the rails that keeps things working, since in some sense the earls don't actually owe any formal allegience to the monarch themsevles. they owe allegience to Ethlenn, and thus to the monarch as Ethlenn's mortal representative


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
I do think the electors should have more power/something here. The oracle of the riven is envisioned as 7 high level warlocks.


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the third pillar I'd add is that probably the Oracles of the Riven and the elite warlock cadre in the army should have some connection and perhaps more active power than is described


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
ha yes

It is also interesting the relationship with sembara


[3/17/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the Tyrwinghan monarchy is quite weak, and all the times it doubles up with sembara works relatively well because basically the monarch focuses on sembara


[3/17/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
right, I can sort of envision that in times of peace, or in times of dire war, Tyrwingha gets a lot out of a close personal alliance with Sembara, and doesn't give up much, since functionally speaking it doesn't really make any different to the people of Clawyn or wherever who the warlocks say the mortal representative of Ethlenn is


[3/17/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
the real question is what does Ethlenn get out of it?


[3/17/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
and also what does Sembara get out of it?

[3/17/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
So riffing on what you said above, what about something like this:

In the ancient times, Ethlenn's earls were effectively her court in the mortal realm, and it would have been common for them to spend some time in the Feywild.  The idea of earls having circuits of villages, and villages owning service to Ethlenn via the earls would date to this time.

When Ethlenn made her deal with Drankor, part of the deal was specifically to create the Oracle of the Riven, which in turn had veto power over the Drankorian governer of the province. The Oracle was also the vehicle by which Ethlenn learned magical secrets from Drankor.

Over the many years of Drankorian rule, Ethlenn fades a little bit into the background, and the earls intermix with the Drankorian elite and start to acquire land and more mudane interests. The ideal of the earls as Ethlenn's knights-errant doesn't vanish, but it is less and less likely a specific earl lives up to that ideal. 

The Drankorian provincial governer has little power over the countryside, but does become something of a powerful figure in Tafolvern (and perhaps, the entire city is only founded in the Drankrorian era)


[3/17/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
The earls also start to spend less / no time in the Feywild, replacing it with time in Tafolvern, where the governer is based, and the governer grows into a position that resolves disputes amongst the earls


[3/17/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
The Oracle of the Riven becomes the focus on Ethlenn's interest, esp because of the magical aspect


[3/17/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
When Drankor falls, and danger comes, the position of monarch develops initially as effectively the Oracle's appointed army commander. The warlock cadres date from the time just after Drankor falls, when Tyrwingha has to look to its own defense, and the core of what later becomes the Army of Mostreve dates from this time as well


[3/17/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Over the years, the balance of power generally develops as:

* The monarch is the commander in chief of the army, and is responsible for the safety of the borders of Tyrwingha, and for foreign relations, and acts as a spokesperson for the Oracle of the Riven. 
* In the tradition of the Drankoria governer, the monarch is also the one who is empowered to resolve disputes between the earls. 

But the monarch has little say in the actual governance of the country


[3/17/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Derik III originally accepts the Tyrwinghan crown basically because he wants to be the commander in chief of an army of warlocks


[3/17/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
His heirs are given the Tyrwinghan crown because Ethlenn/the Oracle of the Riven wants Sembara to be responsible for the defense of the borders of Tyrwinghan - safety in numbers, basically


[3/17/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that works quite well


[3/17/2024 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
And actually the post-Great War history of Sembaran and Tyrwinghan kings works perfectly for the idea that the Oracle is effectively being told by Ethlenn when to align with Sembara (because of say, upcoming hobgoblin wars) vs when not to (because the Sembaran king is going to be weak)


[3/17/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I think in modern Tyrwingha, the Oracle is the ultimate authority and are the ones who are still perceied as Ethlenn's advisors. The monarch's authority comes from the Oracle's support.

The Oracle of the Riven maybe is also responsible for selecting earls. That is, it isn't the whole group of earl's who pick new ones, it is also the Oracle


[3/17/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
So you have this shadowy, clearly fey aligned group that is widely still seen to speak for Ethlenn, picking both the monarch and the earls


[3/17/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually kind of like the earls being elected by their peers, as opposed to the Oracle. I think it sets up more interesting political possibilities than if it is just a shadowy council that controls everything


[3/17/2024 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I can see that


[3/17/2024 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the monarch as commander of the army provides a pretty significant check on the ability of the earls to become too independently powerful - and since the core strength of the Tywinghan army is a cadre of warlocks personally obligated to Ethlenn they can't be made to act against Ethlenn's interests


[3/17/2024 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
this also provides incentive for Sembara to invest in a personal union of the crowd. as Sembara is fairly weak in magic


[3/17/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but also explains why it is always just a personal union of the crowns, and Tyrwingha despite a long history is never incorporated into Sembara directly


[3/17/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
it would probably be good to have some rumors or lore about what the people of Tyrwingha think about Ethlenn's motives, although I think it is probably better to leave the truth unclear


[3/17/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe your player who is writing the 5000 word backstory can come up with some theories about what Ethlenn gets out of all of this


[3/17/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus

[3/21/2024 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
Secondarily it makes me wonder what it‚Äôs actually like to cast a spell in taelgar. How do they fey grant magic?


[3/21/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
And how does being a wizard or sorcerer feel different from being a cleric?

I saw the email just reading it now while I eat lunch


[3/21/2024 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the only fundamental thing about magic is that all magic in taelgar represents the manipulation of extranplanar forces in some way. there is a "magic in taelgar" note in worldbuilding/brainstorming


[3/21/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I have always thought of divine magic (whether technically a cleric or someone like Delwath who is not mechanically a cleric but gets magic from divine beings) as effectively just praying in a some kind of particular way


[3/21/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
(although Delwath is a bit weird here since early on he did not know the source of his power was a god)


[3/21/2024 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
you - as the spellcaster - aren't really doing anything, particularly, except opening a path for divine magic to reach the material plane


[3/21/2024 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
(this bit is pretty undeveloped but the basic idea is the land of the dead acts as kind of a barrier and gods cannot easily reach past it, but living souls allow them to "tunnel" in a way)


[3/21/2024 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
a wizard (or an "arcane-feeling" bard, like Seeker) would be basically manipulating residue leakage/energy from the plane of magic, represented by ley lines


[3/21/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
sorcerers and warlocks depend on the source of their magic. e.g., Cintra (divine soul sorcerer) was not manipulating residual energy of the plane of magic, she is a personal direct channel that allows Shakun to act through her


[3/21/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the echo realms in various forms (feywild, shadowfell, dreamworld, etc) were "spun out" from Taelgar almost by accident when the material plane was created by the High Gods during the Riving, and that act left resonaces / echos that can also be manipulated


[3/21/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
this is where fey magic, probably also primal magic, some forms of necromancy, etc comes from


[3/21/2024 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
this is probably somewhat in-between the cleric "I am a channel for a god to act" and the wizard "I can see and feel strands of arcane magic running across the world that I pull and twist to create spells"


[3/21/2024 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
as far as what the gods and the fey think of each other - I guess it would depend a lot on the individual fey, and perhaps the individual god. I don't think there needs to be a settled standard approach here. 

fey are ultimately the grandchildren of the High Gods, via the archfey. some archfey probably see themselves basically as gods themselves and might consider especially e.g. the embodied gods of the elves as peers. they might consider some of the weaker human gods (tanshi, kestavo) as effectively lesser than them


[3/21/2024 1:19 PM] rsulfuratus
one key point is the echo realms are actually harder to reach for the gods than the material plane (they are even further from the divine realms), so gods would be particularly weak in the echo realms


[3/21/2024 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/21/2024 1:20 PM] .deciusmus
That all makes sense, although when bounced against D&D rules there is a little question of why clerics have to prepare spells


[3/21/2024 1:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think from Celyn's perspective, the basic idea Kiya hinted at - where the fey magic feels like work and the divine magic feels like a gift - fits pretty well


[3/21/2024 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
3 of the 4 characters in my game have the fey touched feat, so there is a a second question I'm trying to answer about how is that different from other magic (although only Kiya of my 4 players seems interested in delving into what it feels like to cast spells in Taelgar)


[3/21/2024 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yes - I like the "misty step is something you have to work at to learn to do" angle


[3/21/2024 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean from a overarching point of view I think the key thing to decide is "what extraplanar energy are you manipulating" and "how are you doing it". with possible answers for the first one ranging from "plane of magic" to "feywild" to "plane of souls (this is probably psionics)" to "divine realms" and many things in between


[3/21/2024 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
how you are doing it could be anything from "arcane rituals" to "prayers"

basically to cast a spell you need a) a power source and b) a way to manipulate / manifest that power source in the material plane


[3/21/2024 1:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense.


[3/21/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but, to take the cleric example, you could imagine all of the following "divine magic users":
- a person born with an innate connection to a particular god, whose soul/spirit/consciousness functions as a conduit allowing the divine energy of the deity to effortlessly flow to the material plane, requiring only that the person learn how to shape the power flowing through them (a divine soul sorcerer)
- a Lakan mystai who has studied the secret prayers and rituals of Laka and learned how to manipulate the resonances of the prayers that flow across the material plane (a wizard)
- a character like Riswynn who is a very traditional "pray to the gods" cleric
- a character like Delwath who I'm not actually sure exactly how he casts spells but it usually feels more like asking for a favor from a particular spirit than praying I think

all those people could be manipulating divine magic in various ways, with very different mechanics

[3/21/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway I have a meeting now but maybe I'll update the magic in taelgar notes later today


[3/21/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I was thinking about Delwath, I think he has a specific relationship with the tanshi and has almost worked together with each one to craft special abilities. 

So asking for a favor works pretty well as a vibe, but I think he has additionally basically collaborated with each tanshi so that there are these specific favors from each one that work well


[3/21/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
doing a little note cleanup. why did you have the eight divines tagged status/tim? maybe just the symbols for the father and the night queen?


[3/21/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I think so


[3/21/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm taking the status/tim tags off them

writing next session - wondering about Delwath's general scrying patterns. assume that, since arriving in Zvervinka, you are not trying to secertly scry in your rooms at night or anything, but let me know if that is not the case. prior to arriving, assume Delwath generally keeps an eye on Chardon, Sura/Karnas, maybe Xurkhaz, but isn't deeply scrying one person unless you tell me


[3/23/2024 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
That sounds about right


[3/24/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
As Kiya - my player  currently writing lots of backstory - writes stuff, it occurred to me that maybe one of the things the fey do in Tyrwingha is protect the place from other weirdness. 

Sembara has a lot of guards and walls around towns, but I think that‚Äôs much less common in Tyrwingha. The wild places are full of fey, instead, and although some fey can be dangerous, many fey instead scare off - directly or indirectly - other dangers


[3/24/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
This is part of why there is a tradition in Tyrwinghan villages, especially rural ones, of watching and maintaining fey spaces. People might not understand exactly the bargain, but ultimately having fey around helps keep these small villages safe


[3/24/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
Thoughts?


[3/24/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
I like it - I would add that it is probably precisely because of the tradition of watching and tending the fey spaces that the fey help, in a sense. it isn't just having fey around, it is maintaining the fey bargain that keeps the village safe


[3/24/2024 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that‚Äôs the implication I was going for


[3/24/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
so you might have tales of villages where something went wrong, they were attacked by zombies or whatever, and the assumption is that someone forgot to tend to the fey. maybe that is actually what happened

{Reactions}
üëç

[3/24/2024 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
Although I‚Äôm not sure people in a Tyrwinghan village would necessarily know or see it as ‚Äúkeeping us safe‚Äù vs ‚Äúmaintaining ancient tradition‚Äù


[3/24/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
i think not precisely keeping us safe, but I think there would be an understanding of some kind of bargain. the fey are not unconditional allies, but if you maintain the traditions and rites, you village has good luck and prospers, and if you don't, you have bad luck


[3/24/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/24/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that‚Äôs perfect


[3/24/2024 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
in fact this could ultimately play back into the bargain with Ethlenn. maybe for some reason Ethlenn's realm became something of a haven for many fey who missed the material world after the Riving, and part of her deal with Tyrwingha is precisely to leave space for her fey subjets who want to return to the material plane


[3/24/2024 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the full history is probably more complicated but that could be part of it


[3/24/2024 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
Ah, I like that.


[3/25/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
I was doing a little tag cleanup in between meetings... there is a set of pages that I'm not sure the right status... 

For example, the Abyss. The page right now is just "The realm of corruption and chaos, home of demons. " But for most purposes, that is actually a complete page. Is it worth making it status/needswork because clearly there is more to it than that? Or is it better to just make it no-status to indicate its done for now?


[3/25/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
Or should we have a new status tag for things that are clearly insufficiently detailed but seem good enough as long as they are only "observed from afar"


[3/25/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
This comes up a lot in places as well...

For example, I made up a town along the Wistel, Gowerbourne, just to have a place to have a distant battle be occuring at...


[3/25/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
The page has no real information, but it is "enough" unless someone decides to go there


[3/26/2024 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
I think status tags are best used only to indicate "there is canon or near-canon information about this page that is not on this page."


[3/26/2024 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
Right so that suggests that, i.e. the Abyss and Gowerbourne should both have empty status tags


[3/26/2024 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think so


[3/26/2024 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
but, if for example, I had introduced a bunch of stuff about Gowerbourne to my players in email, but not yet in obsidian, i'd make it needs work

And if you had a bunch of backstory notes about the Abyss that impacted events in game but were not cleaned up for obisidian, you might set Abyss to "needs work"

And maybe for a page like "Embry" where although I don't have specific facts or notes, the general 'vibe' has come out in game and clearly there should be a couple of sentences before calling it done, I'd add a needswork as well, not to write a long Tollen-style page, but just to have something


[3/26/2024 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I've tended to mark things needswork either because I have explicit notes I need to clean up and add, or because I have a sense of the place that isn't well captured in the current text even if I don't have explicit notes

{Reactions}

[3/26/2024 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
ok, that's good guidance


[3/26/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I've been switching status/unknown to status/tim on pages I didn't write that "look" complete to me but I'm not sure if you have stuff to add


[3/26/2024 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I saw that, cleaning up some of those now


[3/26/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
feel free to give your cleric a permanent magic something and one or three consumables, or if you don't, I might drop a few in


[3/27/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
poking around a little bit in your Sembara notes thinking about a backstory for the cleric, and thinking about the Enst dynamic. Fellburn feels like it needs a good anchor that is not primarily economic to me


[3/27/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. I was struggling with that a little bit


[3/27/2024 1:38 PM] .deciusmus
Why does Fellburn matter?

I like the idea that pre-hobgoblin wars Rinburg was another major tradiing area, but post-war hasn't rebuilt the bridge for various reasons. But why does anyone live in Fellburn?


[3/27/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
I was looking at big french cities in 1400 and pretty much they are all on bridges over rivers


[3/27/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, although there are plenty of counterexamples (the Nile was not bridged for most of pre-modern history as far as I can tell)


[3/27/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i think bridge/no bridge is easy to hand wave, perhaps for hydrological reasons if nothing else, but it means Fellburn needs a reason to exist that isn't "trade nexus"


[3/27/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
Right I wasn‚Äôt super clear. What I mean is that looking at late medieval France ‚Äúexistence of a bridge‚Äù was a pretty good way to get an important city. Not to imply only way


[3/27/2024 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, right, sure


[3/27/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
Dijon is the only main example I could find that didn‚Äôt have a significant bridge and it became large because of Italian trade fairs


[3/27/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
Ie it was a convenient place for Italian and French merchants to meet


[3/27/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think from the existing Sembara notes, the puzzle is that you basically have this history of the Enst as sembaran borderlands, with all the major cities being sacked at one point or another, but also the vibe (perhaps not canon?) of Fellburn growing faster than Rinburg in recent times and expanding from a more minor city to bigger/more important than Rinburg


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] .deciusmus
That vibe is definitely not canon


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Rinburg is a natural economic powerhouse even absent bridge, given location at height of navigation and presence of major cermanic industry


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
so you can see the vibe of "even though the city was burned, it is a natural place to rebuild"


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and the bridge is not economically important because most trade runs east-west not north-south


[3/27/2024 1:47 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/27/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not quite sure what the vibe of the small baronies between the Enst and Addermarch is supposed to be in the current day - this was all land that was essentially completely depopulated during hobgoblin wars


[3/27/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing that matters about fellburn canonically is it needs a reason to be worth fighting for.  It has a big skeletal problem entirely because it was the site of several major battles including some sembaran defeats  so lots and lots of unburied dead all over.


[3/27/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
Yeh I‚Äôve been avoiding writing up Vahaiyas ‚Äúhow I came to be north of the Enst‚Äù story because I am not quite sure what the borderlands are like


[3/27/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think it was an area of intense resettlement by Cece and a very specific attempt to have more barons directly dependent on the crown


[3/27/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I have always thought of this land as relatively marginal


[3/27/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to poke around for a good real-world parallel


[3/27/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
A lot of court favorites getting land etc from the crown directly. But I‚Äôm not sure how that plays out later and I‚Äôm not committed to it


[3/27/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
It can‚Äôt be that marginal if Wisford is the breadbasket of semabara and it‚Äôs just on the other side of the river


[3/27/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess it could be the wistel / north half of wisford that is extremely productive


[3/27/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
And the Enst valley kinda marginal


[3/27/2024 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so, thinking a bit more about the climate and topography. i think that there are hills / highlands along the southern border of Tyrwingha, the southern border of Addermarch, but then also wrapping around and extending north. you can see from the river topography that Addermarch is basically a bit of a basin inside the Mostreve Hills, which probably isolates it a bit and also means Addermarch looks downriver more than overland into Sembara


[3/27/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
this probably means the land slopes down from the mostreve hills to the enst, with more topological variation on the south side than the north side


[3/27/2024 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
the actual Sembaran lowlands extend from the Enst to the Teft, but probably only stretch a little ways south of the Enst


[3/27/2024 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
so in your Borderlands, Estrive/Monste/Vauclaire are probably good agricultural land, but everything south of that might not be


[3/27/2024 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense. So you have hilly terrain in the southern 2/3rds of the borderlands


[3/27/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
it might be something like Provence, but if you imagine that, for whatever reason, it is not suitable for vinticulture, you are left without much. animal husbandry and maybe some orchards


[3/27/2024 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
or the southern applachas


[3/27/2024 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
*appalachians


[3/27/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
In the hobgoblin wars timeline, I have the Shattered Ice Clan basically settling the entire region 
(a) north of the Mostreve Hills
(b) south of the Enst
(c) west of the Aure

So Addermarch is on the southern border, and the entire borderlands and northern 1/3 of Maseau is under hobgoblin control for 45 years


[3/27/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
Although I'm not sure if I really meant the Aure, as the rest of the history isn't that consistent with that


[3/27/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so here is a random image of the Danube from the internet that maybe gets the Enst vibe a little bit:

[3/27/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
why not the Aure?


[3/27/2024 2:16 PM] .deciusmus
Just that the history isn't consistent...

- (DR:: 1602): The lands south of the Enst and west of the Aure are ceded to the hobgoblins. 
(DR:: 1644), late fall/winter: The [[Shattered Ice Clan]] breaks the fortifications in [[Barony of Vaubonne|Vaubonne]] and camps outside [[Fellburn]]


[3/27/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
if the land as far east as the Aure is under hobgoblin control, what are "the fortifications" in Vaubonne?


[3/27/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
that would also be under hobgoblin control


[3/27/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
Unless you imagine the 3rd hobgoblin war starts with a major sembaran success, which pushes the hobgoblins very far west, and then a collapse


[3/27/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
But none of that history has to be canonical


[3/27/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
it could actually work well for the entire area south of the Enst to be hobgoblin for 50 years


[3/27/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I would probably make the Enst the de facto southern border of Sembara from 1602 - 161653


[3/27/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
*1653


[3/27/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
Then you could imagine something like

in the 1600s, you have Cleenseau and Rinburg both with bridges to hobgoblin terriority, and Cleenseau builds up an army, but Rinburg makes a go at economics, trading with the hobgoblins, etc

Fellburn because the main garrison town and where the "cold war" with the hobgoblins is focused. 

Then when the 3rd hobgoblin war breaks out, after some early successes Rinburg and Cleenseau are both occupied.

But Fellburn, although it is sacked in 1647, is never really occupied. It is quickly retaken after the sack


[3/27/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
the only problem is the garrison at Fellburn would not then leave to fight in western Masseau


[3/27/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so you have to change the early part of the 3rd hobgoblin war


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
- (DR:: 1644), fall: After several early successes, the Sembaran [[Army of the South]] is fought to a stalemate at the [[Battle of Lysandale]] in the western reaches of Maseau


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
yeah to make that work


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but that could be the Dunfry garrison instead, the army of the west


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
You had some secret reason/idea behind why the hobgoblins started up again


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
But the flow of the war still works fine with the focus initially being a western campaign, focused on maseau, with the western army of sembara


[3/27/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
and the southern army - based in fellburn - is defensive


[3/27/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I need to draw it out to visualize the territorial changes more clearly


[3/27/2024 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
something like:

1600

[3/27/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but getting back to Fellburn and the border baronies, I think this still leaves a slight puzzle, because Fellburn is not naturally positioned as a defensive location. so I think Fellburn should have something worth defending to motivate the garrison


[3/27/2024 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
it is kind of a weird shape. why do the hobgoblins push so far west, especially if the border baronies are kind of marginal land?


[3/27/2024 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
1645

[3/27/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is less marginal than the northern third of Maseau, which is hill and also dry


[3/27/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
But Sembara has the ability and will to defend the Enst, so isn't going to give up land north of the Enst. It is a strategic sacrifice on the Sembaran side to give up marginal land to avoid a bloody battle defending the Enst, which the hobgoblins take for similar reasons


[3/27/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Simiarly, the core of Maseau (the southern 1/3 or so where the land is better) is where almost all the people of Maseau live, so they are going to defend their homes to the death. But the northern parts are mostly empty, so easy for the hobgoblins to move in


[3/27/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not entirely sure what is canon and what is speculation at this point, but why not have the hobgoblins move east instead of stretching their territory? at the end of the first hobgoblin war (more or less Sembaran victory) they are confined to what is quite marginal land in western Maseau and Enford; second hobgoblin war starts basically because the hobgoblins want better land, and is more-or-less a hobgoblin victory


[3/27/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
so at the end of 2nd war the hobgoblin territory is basically a crescent north + west of addermarch


[3/27/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
the only bit that's canon is Cleenseau needs to be occupied by hobgoblins ~1645 - 1650 ish


[3/27/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
basically all that changes here is that perhaps there is something of a frozen conflict in western maseau (west of road, south of enford), where the land is not worth big effort and you have a bit of back and forth with maseau but semabara doesn't get involved, having driven hobgoblins south of enst


[3/27/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
then initially 3rd hobgoblin war starts in the west, for mysterious reasons the hobgoblins launch a major offensive, sembara gets nervous about dunfry, and things procede


[3/27/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
then I think you get the following vibes:
- Cleanseau and Rinburg are economically central to the Enst river trade network, and despite occupation / destruction in the 1650 +/- spring back strong; it is possible that one or both actively trades with hobgoblins
- Fellburn is an important city for cultural / religious / historical reasons despite being economically less vibrant than Rinburg, is better defended and seen as something that cannot be lost
- Borderlands south of Enst are fully under hobgoblin rule; people remain in places, but as the Radiant Alliance closes in reprisals are pretty brutal and most structures are burned, so as of 1653 this is quite barren / unpopulated land


[3/27/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
- Addermarch becomes very isolated from Sembara in this period, and draws much closer to Tyrwingha


[3/27/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
(Addermarch has always felt more culturally connected to Tyrwingha anyway)


[3/27/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
(I have a meeting so might be slow to respond)


[3/27/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
So I think what this needs is just a good reason for Sembara to care about Fellburn and for a significant population center there. 

One obvious option is a religious site. Sembara doesn't really have religious organizations per se so the site of an abbey or something probably doesn't work, but you could imagine almost a Bath-like vibe if Fellburn is the site of magical healing waters or something else magical and religious that would drive pilgrimages


[3/27/2024 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Another obvious option is a extraplanar weak point, which could have various and sundry impacts


[3/27/2024 3:04 PM] rsulfuratus
it feels like a magical explanation is correct here, and probably something that predates Drankor, which would potentially make Fellburn a very old area of settlement


[3/27/2024 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I am thinking that the cleric I'm making up is in his mid-50s, so his parents were probably born sometime between 1635-1645. i think that perhaps he has a family connection to Fellburn - his mother fled the sack of Fellburn when she was 10 or 12, or something like that


[3/27/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
still haven't figured out what he was doing before he found magic late in life, stay tuned


[3/27/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
I think this is all good


[3/27/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
So basically the hobgoblin wars timeline needs to change a little so that 
early part of war is fighting in the west and large defensive buildup along the enst
middle part of war is parts of the enst line collapse, but not all, and perhaps fellburn is never actually sacked and a valiant defense of fellburn holds out
late part of war is pushing hobgoblins west

I like magical explanation for Fellburn being important; I am not sure I like magic healing waters as that is too similar to Isingue I think


[3/27/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, just grabbing that as it is why Bath was an important place in the real world


[3/27/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
but playing on Fellburn, could be something like an eternal flame that magically burns and supposedly removes curses (maybe once an ancient kestavan site). or an oracle of some kind. perhaps kind of a strange oracle - not necessarily divine magic


[3/27/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe a mythical defender - the phoenix of fellburn or something like that, although probably don't want an actual phoenix just hanging out in fellburn


[3/27/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the key feature is something that drives pilgrimages which in turn drives the economy and growth of the city


[3/27/2024 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
right


[3/27/2024 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
A pushed a slight cleanup to timeline of Sembaran history to incorporate the above


[3/27/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
Only bit I am not sure if is if Fellburn should actually be sacked, or if the hobgoblins are repelled. Probably depends on the nature of what is in Fellburn


[3/27/2024 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I'm trying to think of a good idea for that, need to let it simmer for a bit


[3/27/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
The Fell Burn, the Beacon of Fate in the ancient language of the original settlers of the Enst river valley, is a twisting crystalline structure, almost tree-like in form, perched on a rise above the Enst. For as long as anyone can remember, it has been said that, when the light of sunrise is reflected in its twists and turns, the crystals sing, in a language no one knows, but the song sings of hope, of comfort. those who make the pilgrimage in the night, and reach the crystals as the sun rises, say that they hear in the song the answers to doubts that have haunted them. 

Before the Drankorians came, the songs were thought to be Kestavan songs, and the Fell Burn was a sacred place. 

To the Drankorians, it was many things, and strange rumors spread. The most persistant was that, according to the Drankorian mages, it was a fragment of the moment of creation, frozen in time. The Drankorians built a fortification, and soon after a library, and it became a frequent site of travel and study, and the town of Fellburn grew. Many forgot the original meaning of Fellburn, and it acquired many names: the Singing Tree, in the colloquial, the Crystal of Time, among the wizards, and simply the Oracle of Hope to most. 

After the Fall of Drankor, Fellburn persisted - in these days, much seemed dark, and many sought the hope and comfort of the Oracle. Some in these days thought it was a miracle of the Wyrdling, or perhaps the Sibyl, but the priests never claimed a divine presence. 

As Sembara grew, Fellburn came to prosper. It was never the greatest economic powerhouse of the Enst, for the river was too wide here for a crossing, even in Drankorian days (or, the hills on either side too steep), and with no easy harbors it did not lend itself to a riverboat port. 

But, the pilgrims always came, and with them coin, and so the city grew.

I like that. Interestingly this is very close to the line of sunset in the fey wild.


[3/27/2024 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I was trying to make it very much not fey flavored - kind of thinking this is more of a mystery that shouldn't fit any obvious categories


[3/27/2024 6:31 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah it didn‚Äôt read as fey flavored - but it is kinda similar to the Sunset Gate thing I made up in a way

[3/27/2024 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
Sometimes it sings every hour. Sometimes it is a week


[3/27/2024 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I was going for the "hike up mt fuji at night to see the sunrise" vibe but yeah could be just sings when it sings, that might be better


[3/27/2024 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
I think the sunrise connection is going to make it seem fey once my players go to the sunset gate


[3/27/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
right. i actually like the unpredictability more


[3/27/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so I was thinking it is indestructable and couldn't be sacked by the hobgoblins, and also ancient and pre-dates sembara, so probably Fellburn does get sacked, but is seen as a very significant loss out of proportion to its military significance (hobgoblins captured Oracle of Hope) so there is a lot of motivation to recaputre Fellburn


[3/27/2024 6:36 PM] .deciusmus
Right that works. The town is sacked but not occupied


[3/27/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Or only occupied briefly.


[3/27/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have a some idea of what this really is or just random coolness?


[3/27/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
my best guess is the Drankorian wizards are correct, and it is a frozen piece of the Riving, but not committed to that


[3/27/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
my second guess is it could eventually tie into whatever the moon is


[3/27/2024 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
(depending on whether you want it to be significant for your campaign / Igzil)


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm. I will ponder. I like the idea of this a lot though.


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
Are you envisioning it at the center of town? Or outside the town more in a separate space ?


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] rsulfuratus
no, outside town


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] rsulfuratus
not far outside town, like <1 mile


[3/27/2024 6:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm thinking this part of the Enst is fairly hilly and so this stands on a rise of land above the river, and the town itself is in the valley


[3/27/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
Right that works


[3/27/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
How big are you envisioning it? Like 10 people at a time walking through it? 50?


[3/27/2024 6:45 PM] rsulfuratus
closer to 10 than 50. maybe a dozen?


[3/27/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
presumably there would be some kind of organizations associated with it, a guild or pilgrim's fund or something, that helps keep things organized


[3/27/2024 6:46 PM] .deciusmus
Also how do you feel about undead seeming to be terrified or repealed by it? I have no specific reason but I am sure this will come up soon in my game because the party wants to go see what‚Äôs going on with the siege of fellburn right after rinburg


[3/27/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
that would make perfect sense


[3/27/2024 6:47 PM] rsulfuratus
it is small enough it isn't really an effective shelter, but yes undead should avoid it


[3/27/2024 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
(In theory the session you would be npcing at would be part lake monster part roleplaying in fellburn‚Äî so having the cleric have some connection to fellburn is perfect he‚Äôd accompany the party onward and then stay in fellburn)

basic outline of Armand backstory:
- mother was from Fellburn, fled the sack (probably around 11-12) but was separated from her family, ended up in Embry, found her way onto a ship and became a sailor
- father from local middle class Embry family, maybe a scribe or something
- grew up with mostly absent mother, but always eager to hear stories of the sea, and her stories of Fellburn
- as soon as he was old enough, left home to become a sailor, and traveled on merchant ships around the Green Sea
- was a sailor for several decades, into his 40s or so
- maybe 6-7 years ago, something happened; not sure exactly what yet, but something to do with undead that (a) triggered / opened his mind to latent divine magic and (b) left him deeply concerned with protecting the world from the wandering dead
- returned to Embry and became an acolyte at temple of Night Queen, practicing magic and learning about undead


[3/27/2024 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
I like the basic outline. There is a bit of a vibe I have going with various night queen associated people having a sense of unease before the undead uprising. Perhaps that sense of unease made him leave Embry and go to the Oracle of Hope, So he was in the Enst river valley for Pyravella.


[3/27/2024 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe in Rinburg (or Fellburn).


[3/27/2024 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure how he joined up with Vahaiya and their crew though. It feels like if he was in either Rinburg or Fellburn at the time he would have gotten caught in in those events and wouldn‚Äôt be in Champimont now


[3/27/2024 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe he was in Rinburg when the first wave of undead rose, but at the time no one knew about the lake monster, so he immediately set out on the road to see how he could help. After all in many places it was just one or two zombies, which he‚Äôd usually be able to defeat himself.


[3/27/2024 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
He got caught up in the area around Eftly, where a big ghast-like creature devoured the town and literally met Vahaiya and their crew when they came to kill it


[3/28/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm. I have an NPC (Eremon) who is a (non-magical) acolyte of the Night Queen, from Fellburn, who left Fellburn ~6/7 years ago and was wandering around, and has been recently having premonitions about the undead rising.

I wonder if something happened around when Cece died that foreshadowed the lich in some way.

I kinda like the idea that the lich is ultimately in conflict with the Night Queen, and goes after her elders because they are closing in on him.


[3/28/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
(I mean, he isn't *intentionally* in conflict with her, but he is very anti-theNightQueen, he is basically trying to subvert the natural order of death and so on)


[3/28/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to get the villages correct, there isn't really a great map that I can find in Obsidian. Basically you have, west to east along the Great South Road:
Cleanseau -- 6 miles -- Beury -- 15 miles -- Dallet -- 10? miles -- Champimont -- 10? miles -- Eftly -- 20 miles -- Rinburg -- 95 miles -- Fellburn


[3/28/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
is that right?


[3/28/2024 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah basically.


[3/28/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
I have some better notes in my dm folder.


[3/28/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
Let me look in a min


[3/28/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
I should move this to proper notes...

Starting in Rinburg the usual walking route is:

Rinburg to Essenmer (long day on foot, 12 miles)
Essenmer to Eftly (short day, 9 miles)
Eftly to Champimont (very short day, 6 miles, but Champimont is the largest town between Rinburg and Cleenseau)
Champimont to Dallet (long day, 13 miles)
Dallet to Beury (long day, 15 miles)
Beury to Cleenseau ~5 miles


[3/28/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't made up anything past Rinburg toward Fellburn


[3/28/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
also, if I'm reading the timeline correctly, the attacks basically start all over around Jan 7/8. where is Vahiaya then? by Jan 15th they end up in Champimont, heading west from Eftly where a monster was defeated - but at this point Fellburn has been under siege for a week or so


[3/28/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Armand was with Vahiaya in Eftly, or met in Champimont?


[3/28/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
Unclear.


[3/28/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
or undetermined?


[3/28/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
have a meeting more in a bit


[3/28/2024 1:38 PM] .deciusmus
The undead awaken in 3 waves

* Jan 4th overnight - dead awaken across Sembara, mostly in places where there are large numbers of unburied dead
* Jan 5th overnight - second wave of dead awaken
* Jan 6th overnight - third wave of dead awaken

But in many cases not near civilization or in scattered places, and sometimes take a night or two to move from "awake" to "above ground"

So the basic timeline is in a variety of places across Sembara, problems with undead start as early as the morning of Jan 5th or as late as the evening of Jan 8th


[3/28/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
The Fellburn siege begins in the predawn hours of Jan 8th


[3/28/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
Eftly is attacked on Jan 7th, although the monster grows and becomes big only the 10th-11th (although this isn't canonical)


[3/28/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
I don't have a canonical route for Vahaiya and the Rangers, but the basic idea is:

The 5th or 6th  they get magical communication (sending/speaking stones/etc) of the start of problems, as various groups within Sembara basically start asking the Rangers for help.

Vahaiya is in Addermarch or the border baronies north of the Mostreve Hills and this point, and is one of several groups the Rangers send north. 

Takes 3-5 days to get from wherever to the Enst (near Rinburg, I guess). But some encounters or problems could have delayed this a bit. 

I haven't entirely figured out why the Rangers didn't stay in Rinburg to try to help with the lake monster. Either they never passed through Rinburg (so didn't know about it, i.e. if they came over the Enst on the west side of Eftly and/or in between Eftly and Rinburg) or they felt someone else was doing it and agreed to split up.


[3/28/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess where I'm going with this is my feeling is Armand would probably not head west away from Fellburn, upon hearing news of big undead siege there, unless he is explicitly going to get help for Fellburn, or he can't get to Fellburn because of dangers on the road or something like that


[3/28/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but not sure enough about the timeline of what is happening where to propose a coherent "last two weeks" itinerary for him


[3/28/2024 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
I suspect the best story for him is that he is actually trying to get to Fellburn


[3/28/2024 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
He was - for whatever reason - west of Eftly when the undead starting rising. He might not have even heard about the siege of Fellburn at first, as the ghast-creature in Eftly was cutting off most news from the east


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
why did Vaihaya turn west from Eftly instead of east towards Rinburg?


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
So they'd run into my PCs? Duh üòÑ


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
well obviously


[3/28/2024 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
Realistically, I suspect Vahaiya was basing themselves in Champimont. So it is a return-to-base and regroup


[3/28/2024 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
It's only 6 miles to Eftly, so reasonable to defeat the monster, return to Champimont for a long rest/restock, then head out


[3/28/2024 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
what is happening on the Wistel? are there undead there too or confined to the south?


[3/28/2024 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
Here's the full set of outbreaks:

The major clusters are:
* Fellburn skeletal army, emerges Jan 6th - 7th overnight, crawls and forms and reforms, some people flee and die Battle of Stavenford / Battle of Fellburn, (largest mass of undead)
* Eskbridge Far east near Tyrwingha 4th - 5th is (big)
* Borderlands all 3, 5 clusters total, mostly small, local devastation and local heroics (maybe doesn't happen)
* Rinburg 6th - 7th emerges in lake (giant eel thing only, minimal actual undead)
* Aveil hills, emerges 4th - 5th (small)
* Ainwick emerges 5th - 6th bandit zombies (big))
* Cleenseau 4th - 5th second one 7th (small)
* Dunmore 4th - 5th (small)
* Enford 6th - 7th (small)
* Gowerborne Wis 2 - 5th - 6th, (big)

Although not 100% of those are canonical


[3/28/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
It is isolated to south of the Wistel for the most part; the only case I have of an outbreak beyond the Wistel is in the Aine Hills


[3/28/2024 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing near Embry, or really outside the Dunfry - Aveil - Wisford section other than the one outbreak in the Aine Hills


[3/28/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
The ones that I'm sure about are

Gowerbourne, on the Wistel, but the outbreak is actually inland. This is where the Duke of WIsford is now (although he is heading to Fellburn)

Fellburn.

Aveil Hills (but this is small)

Aine Hills (this is distracting the Army of the West)

Enford (small)


[3/28/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
(plus the stuff in Rinburg and Cleenseau, although none of that is very big)


[3/28/2024 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
I'm leaning toward the Borderlands one being not real (I didn't even hint at it in game) and the Eskbridge one being just false rumors


[3/28/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
(I'm in a meeting, responses might be slow)


[3/28/2024 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
So here is roughly what I would propose for Armand. Timing not precise and needs checking with travel times. 

Early Dec sometime (5-6 weeks ago, per your comment in Armand's obisidan note), he left Embry based on bad premonitions about undead and such. Reaches Wisford and then heads upriver, towards Gowerbourne and eventually aiming for Ainwick. This could be (a) on orders of the temple in Embry, if there is an organized effort to send people investigating premonitions; (b) because he knows someone he wants to connect with, someone with Night Queen connections he feels might have insight; (c) perhaps because of dreams / visions. Probably (b) is cleanest but I don't know the relevant context.

It is ~250 miles from Wisford to Ainwick, so say is not pushing hard and gets there in ~2 weeks, mid/late December. Spends Pyravela in Ainwick. 

It is only 50-60 miles from Ainwick to the Aveil Hills, so when rumors reach him in Ainwick (maybe Jan 6-7) of undead, he heads south, hurrying, reaching Aveil Hills perhaps in 2 days, by Jan 8-9.  (*note this requires delaying the emergence of Ainwick undead so he has left by the time they emerge, or deciding this didn't happen)

In Aslain, rumors are flying about all kinds of badness, mostly to the south, so he heads south. At this point, probably trying to get to Fellburn and help there, but hears of the lake monster in Rinburg and does not think he can face it alone, so swings west to gather news and hopefully allies. 

At that point, either meets Vahaiya and their crew in Eftly and helps with the monster there, or ends up in Champimont looking for news and allies heading east.


[3/28/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
Fleshing out a bit more, I would say it probably makes the most sense if:
(a) Armand left mostly on his own, not sent on a mission, largely just feeling restless and sure something bad was coming, and was aiming for Ainwick or some place near there, where he knew someone, an old friend, perhaps not a human - I am imagining basically a kind of recluse / hermit but who Armand would trust to have a sense of the land, corruption. probably not someone dedicated to the Night Queen, more like a druid-type, or a centaur, or maybe a halfling
(b) There was not an undead attack on Ainwick, so that Armand isn't tempted to turn back; there could have been outbreaks downriver between Ainwick and Gowerborne, or rumors could be confused


[3/28/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think it works better if he is local to Aveil in the Jan 5-8th timeframe. What if instead of going up the Wistel, he ends up in Aveil. Same idea (seeking a recluse/hermit type) but this person lives in the eastern eaves of the Cleenseau Wood, a bit upriver from Aslain say


[3/28/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
For him, the undead outbreak starts with a few zombies arising in the village next door, or whatever, and for ~3-4 days he is busy in the local area around  just helping folks.

Around Jan 10th he hears of 
(a) some trouble in the Aveil Hills
(b) the siege of Fellburn

And he dithers for a bit but ultimately is compelled to head towards Fellburn. He heads south along the Auberonne


[3/28/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
But before he reaches Rinburng, he gets pulled along a series of villages with problems and ends up finding it faster to get back on track by heading due south from some village west of the Auberonne, which puts him smack into Eftly.

He basically runs into Vahayia and their group hunting the ghast just outside Eftly


[3/28/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that works. the exact route doesn't matter too much


[3/28/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Right. It is helpful from a "not needing to decide everything" if his knowledge base is mostly local, not far away


[3/29/2024 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus

[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i tentatively suspect windows/mac confusion


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
the issue is the ".md"


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
you have a block in export_vault


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
with the comment
 ## check to see if we have a broken obsidian path
                 # this is not the best way to do this


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that is what I'm looking at - that is where this should hit


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
the link ends with .md\


[3/29/2024 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
so the parts has as last part

Silverthorwn.md\ for example


[3/29/2024 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
but that isn't in self.path_dict, because the actual file ended up in as Silverthorwn


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
no .md


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
do you mean it ends .md, or .md\?


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
sorrry or .md\\?


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
I believe the 2nd one


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
where does the extra `\` come from?


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
here is the parts:
['Campaigns', 'Cleenseau Campaign', 'Treasure', 'Chest of the Forest Guardian.md\\']


[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
I am not sure


[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
Ah


[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
it is because it is in a dataview table


[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
so dataview adds \ to escape the |


[3/29/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
should just be able to flip the order of the rstrip and the replace then


[3/29/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
the actual line is:

| ![[assets/chest-of-forest-guardian.png\|240]]   | [[Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Treasure/Chest of the Forest Guardian.md\|Chest of the Forest Guardian]] | chest | [Reference](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8244307-chest-of-the-forest-guardian) |


[3/29/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
the actual line is:

```| ![[assets/chest-of-forest-guardian.png\|240]]   | [[Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Treasure/Chest of the Forest Guardian.md\|Chest of the Forest Guardian]] | chest | [Reference](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8244307-chest-of-the-forest-guardian) |
```


[3/29/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
what fixed it for me was:

```-                if parts[-1] in self.path_dict:
-                    alias = str(parts[-1]) if alias == "" else alias
+                final_part = self.remove_trailing_backslash(parts[-1])
+                if final_part.endswith(".md"):
+                    final_part = os.path.splitext(final_part)[0]
```


[3/29/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
and then using final_part instead of parts[-1] in the rest of the block


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
wait where does self.remove_trailing_backslash come from? did you add that too?


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
it comes from chatgpt


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
```
    def remove_trailing_backslash(self, string):
        if string.endswith("\\"):
            return string[:-1]
        return string
```


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
rstrip does that


[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
I don't see rstrip in the code though


[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] rsulfuratus
`clean_name = parts[-1].replace('.md', '').rstrip("\\/")`


[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
ah, sure


[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
your code might be better than chat gpt's


[3/29/2024 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
I just asked it how to remove a trailing "\\"


[3/29/2024 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
chat gpt didn't know about rstrip


[3/29/2024 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
what I'm slightly confused by is as I understand it the order shouldn't matter, replace then rstrip or rstrip then replace


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
I don't know what you are looking at


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
so there might be something else wrong with my code


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
`clean_name = parts[-1].replace('.md', '').rstrip("\\/")`


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, wait


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think I have that version!

[4/1/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Kiya (Celyn's player) asked why Sembarans are distrustful of magic, anyhing you'd add / change about the below (haven't sent it yet):

There is no one event or specific reason why wizards are distrusted in Sembara, but there is a long cultural tradition dating back hundreds of years that is suspicious of "learned magic" and in particular magic as something you study and unpack how it works and then use that knowledge to make more of it. Where exactly it developed none of you would know, but since the Great War, a number of events have occurred that enforce and seem to confirm the suspicion. The most notable was the story of Elaine I and her twin sister Anne, which is long and tragic and something I will write up in more detail sometime - but in is briefest form there was a contest for the throne between Elaine and Anne, and in the course of that contest Anne studied magic deeply so she could learn to cast a powerful geas to force Elaine to give up the throne. This ended up failing (was found out, and undone) but it was seen as a confirmation of the worst things about wizards. The year after Anne's treachery was the Cursed Cold, when for five months fire radiated cold, not heat, and the days grew colder, not warmer, as the sun rose. This devastated the areas it impacted (cooking and growing crops are both hard without heat) and was seen by many as somehow related to Anne's treachery and a cost the entire kingdom bore for her magic.¬†

(There is also the story of how Drankor¬†fell, 700-ish years ago - a red mist that spread throughout the land killing millions - supposedly caused by the mages of Drankor, somehow - Drankor was obsessed¬†as a civilization with understanding magic, or so it is said).


[4/1/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
More broadly, there are other similar cultural stories that share the message: magic is something to worship, or be in awe of, or philosophize about, marvel at, accept as a gift, etc but studying how it works, unpicking the central mystery is seen as dangerous (choosing to mess around with forces you can't ever really understand), potentially nefarious (too many stories of research or other deep delving into the secrets of magic leading to corruption and evil, i.e. no one thinks Anne in the story above started out¬†bad), and in some cases, a little bit sacreligious (magic is a gift of the Sibyl, trying to learn magic is like trying to force your way into her good graces - that said, in Tollen the Sibyl is the patron of the university of magic, so this isn't a universal interpretation of her).

It wouldn't be right to oversell the prejudice either. Wizards are not hunted on sight, or anything like that. But many emigrate, i.e. to Tollen or Chardon, where magic is more accepted, and there are not many teachers, etc so they end up being rarer than other types of magic users. Interestingly, a wild magic sorcerer doesn't encounter the same prejudice, even though they may literally be dangerous to those around them - to a Sembaran, they were born with their magic, and so it isn't them choosing to be dangerous by delving into deep secrets.¬†
These are broadly Tyrwinghan beliefs as well, although in Tyrwingha there would be the added wrinkle of the fey. Famously, Ethlenn wanted to learn Drankorian magical secrets, and that plays into this idea that exploring the deep secrets of how magic works is too dangerous for mortals, and is best left to the fey.


[4/1/2024 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is basically right. One minor detail I would change is that the University in Tollen is not really a "magic university", and indeed the study of magic is a pretty minor part of the scholarship and learning at the university. Tollen is a lot more open and accepting of magic that Sembara, but there is a pretty strong contrast between e.g. Chardon and Tollen in terms of just how much organized magic you see walking around.


[4/1/2024 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also add that it isn't so much that wizards are hunted on sight or anything (they aren't), but that scholarly organizations and secret societies dedicated to the study of magic just never really get established in Sembara and are fairly strongly discouraged. So a lone wizard in their tower taking an appentice might be seen as a bit dangerous, a bit eccentic, but not someone you'd drive out of town; while something like the Society of the Open Scroll would be at a minimum forced underground if not outright driven out


[4/1/2024 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Finally I think the Tyrwinghan belief that probing the deep secrets of arcane magic is too dangerous for mortals and best left to the fey is a fairly common feeling across Sembara, probably spreading from Tyrwingha to some extent


[4/1/2024 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that all makes sense. This is in the context of an NPC they met, a wizard in Rinburg, who led, and is being blamed for the failure of, the first attempt to kill the lake monster


[4/1/2024 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
So the vibe has beeen a bit of prejudice and quickness to judge, i.e. it is clearly her fault. But also not like people are trying to drive her out of time or anything (and clearly she was powerful/important enough that she was in a position to help led the previous assault)


[4/1/2024 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think part of the vibe is that arcane magic is quite dangerous and quick to go wrong, which seems like it fits well. This probably develops even more strongly after all the fallout of the weird magic during the blood years in sembara and then the whole Elaine and Anne thing


[4/1/2024 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
do you think random PCs would know who the 3 despairs are?


[4/1/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I‚Äôm not sure. Originally I have kind of thought of that as elven lore but also not sure what is gained by keeping them secret?


[4/1/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
(I am writing another play-by-email scene) and this wizard, who is obsessed with transformation, definitely knows of them, and is going to mention one of her nightmares is the werewolves of the Mad One (i.e forced transformation). Just trying to decide how much to meta-explain vs wait for them to ask about.

I think in general I'm going to wait for them to ask I think it is kinda reasonable that any relatively learned person might have read of them (i.e. say Armand) but a 23 year old Tyrwinghan farmboy probably not


[4/1/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think that makes sense. There would be rumors and lore that is accessible in world to generally learned knowledgable people but they are not default knowledge


[4/2/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
So I introduced this divine soul sorcerer of the Sibyl, who is fascinated by magic and has kicked off a conversation with my PCs about the philosophy of magic (in a play-by-email exchange we are going to do over the next 2ish weeks). 

Do you have any interest in being part of it, either as Tristan (the sorcerer) or Armand? 

There is nothing ‚Äúgame/plot‚Äù related it‚Äôs just going to be people asking Tristan what he knows about different kinds of magic


[4/2/2024 8:15 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that seems fun


[4/2/2024 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
Btw, all I have on Tristan is in obsidian. He has some mysterys (i.e. this He grew up in Tyrwingha, in Tafolwern, he says, but in the course of your talking about home, he talks about one of his earliest memories, the birth of Cece I's youngest daughter - which happened 57 years ago).

I was vaguely thinking he spent some time in the feywild, but any explanation you come up with for that, if it comes up, would be fine

yeah, okay, going to keep that, was just messing around with a few other variants


[4/4/2024 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the context by which Tristan and your players ended up sitting down in an inn together?


[4/4/2024 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
meant to ask earlier


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
So Tristan and Vahayia and bunch of other rangers just killed a ghast in Eftly


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
The PCs were also heading toward Eftly to fight the ghast


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
(Note -
Ghast was giant growing thing much worse than regular ghast)


[4/4/2024 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
PCs showed up in Champimont (the biggest town between Rinburg and Cleenseau, but still small) when a big party was going on, basically a celebration/outpouring of relief because the rangers had killed the ghast


[4/4/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
The PCs and rangers all ended up in the same inn, and met, and spent some time talking and planning together. About who goes where next to deal with various remaining undead bits


[4/4/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
This scene is after the planning part, when half the rangers have gone to bed and the remaining are staying up talking


[4/4/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
They are in a private back room and the three magically interested PCs and Tristan end up talking


[4/4/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so Tristan has heard the PCs talk about magic and what they can do, but not actually seen them fight?


[4/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Right. He saw Viepuck cast a good berry spell and disguise self but both were odd - Viepucks patron is some kind of Far Realm alien mind and the disguise self is psionic-vibey

cleaning up some status tags and ran into an issue. Bas Udda was burned down by gnolls in April 1748, but resettled in Nov 1748. having a created date later than destroyed date breaks things.

I think best option here is just to use campaign info for this, instead of created/destroyed, but curious what you think


[4/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
I think having a block in the body of the text like

%%^Date:1748%%
In April of 1748... and in Nov of 1748
%%^End%%

And then not set the created destroyed (or set the created to the "original foundation")


[4/5/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
If you want lines to appear in the header, campaign info I guess is fine but I've become less of a fan of a lot of header lines


[4/5/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess Bas Udda is a bit of a weird case since the destruction and resettlement are both in the past. 

the general case though is that if taelgarverse in its current form had existed in 3 years ago or whenever, I'd want the page to be "Burned by gnolls on XX date"


[4/5/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe trying to put it all in the header is not that useful


[4/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
but I think I'd not overly worry about the non-existent game that is taking place in May 1748


[4/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
like, if Taelgarverse had existing back then, you could have changed the page to be "burned by gnolls" and then updated it when it was resettled to no longer say "burned by gnolls" and have text instead


[4/5/2024 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right. I guess that is the general solution, if a place is resettled just delete the destroyed date from the header and move to text


[4/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
right


[4/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
that doesn't work though if the resettlement is in the future compared to an active game


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
I think at some level worrying about the abstraction of "taelgarverse has to be able to reflect exactly what is happening on a specific random date" is too much trouble


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, like if Rinburg were destroyed by zombies in your game


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
Well I have a live example, Eftly, the little town that was destroyed by undead


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
But realistically, no one cares or has even decided if it gets resettled


[4/5/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
so it doesn't matter that on your taelgarverse it shows upa s "destroyed by a ghast creature, 1720"


[4/5/2024 4:47 PM] .deciusmus
But if in a year we are hunting clues about the Isingue acid monster and you want to reuse a bunch of the Enst valley stuff rather than setting the clue hunting somewhere else, it could in theory be a problem


[4/5/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point I actually looked a bit at basically abstracting the whereabouts logic to essentially every header piece of information


[4/5/2024 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
In theory I don't think it would be that hard to either introduce the idea ofa "Second life", i.e. say a page can have
created/destroyed/born/died
recreated/redestroyed/reborn/reallykilled


[4/5/2024 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
that could also work for undead, as an aside



[4/6/2024 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus

Sketching out a ton of new places for next Dunmar session on Thursday. Mostly expecting you'll learn about it in game but want a second opinion on a bunch of names. 

(this is the northern part of the peninsula, extending northwest from the canal - divided into three provinces in the Chardonian Empire)

Portalia (province around the canal, originally derives from Drankorian for passage)
Nevium (north end of canal city)
Pergia (south end of canal city)
Artevus (another city in this province)

Cedrano (next province to northwest, name derives from the largest river, Kedron, which is an old Northros / Northerner name)
Castrella (provincial capital)
Ombraforte (village or town)

Tamaris (final province, name derives from name for the peninsula, the Tamaro Peninsula; see below for alternatives)
Roccena (roc-CHE-na, provincial capital)
Tenze (TEN-tseh, city/town)
Antissus (city/town)
Sarvia (city/town)
Silbana (river)

Alternative peninsula names:
Maravio (province is Maravium)
Raziano (province in Razianium)

Other city/town/village names:
Telumis
Serraventia
Canophris

I like the general vibe. Prefer Raziano to Tamaro slightly but really either seems good. Don‚Äôt love Maravio

The end of the session tomorrow might be the breaking of the siege of Fellburn, which in my head is highlighted by a couple of powerful npcs. Do you think say a 15th lvl cleric, a 13th level paladin, and two 11th level clerics is too much magical force for the Duke of Wisford to have brought together?


[4/27/2024 7:08 PM] rsulfuratus
IMO yes


[4/27/2024 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I haven't thought super carefully about it, but in general I've tended to not create NPCs who can cast higher than 5th level spells, unless they are supposed to be basically the most powerful people in a kingdom


[4/27/2024 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it breaks worldbuilding a bit if there are non-PCs who have that much magic. Or I guess rather non-adventurers, counting both PCs and villians


[4/27/2024 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
Isn‚Äôt it implausible that there are no super high level clerics in sembara at all though?


[4/27/2024 7:15 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn‚Äôt sure about the number ‚Äî ie would say 3 of the 8 most powerful clerics in sembara really be at this battle. But it seems like there should be say 8-10 clerics of 10+ level, right? I guess maybe half that makes more sense


[4/27/2024 7:15 PM] rsulfuratus
based on this with a population of 25 million (which might be high for Sembara - France in 1500 was more like 15 million), there would be perhaps as many as 13 clerics of level 9+

[4/27/2024 7:17 PM] rsulfuratus
a 15th level cleric would likely be the most powerful magic user in Sembara - so I guess the question is, would the most powerful magic user in Sembara be at the seige of Fellburn?


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point (in same spreadsheet) we had calculated about 12 milliion humans in Sembara. So that would imply something like 4 of the 6 most power magic users showing up at Fellburn


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
Right that‚Äôs too much


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
Probably should be 11th and 9th or something


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
More later


[4/27/2024 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
So I think I‚Äôd revise to have one 13th or so level powerful cleric and then a couple of 7th levels. Plus a 9th or 10th level paladin.


[4/27/2024 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
The 13th probably is one of the 3-4 most powerful casters in sembara (although the spreadsheet suggests about 15 level 9+ casters in sembara)


[4/27/2024 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems sensible


[4/27/2024 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
Actually maybe 11th. Just need them to be high enough level to cast forbiddance

I got sucked into a rabbit hole about the Villa of Papyri (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_of_the_Papyri) and then reading about the transition from papyrus scrolls to parchment manuscripts and the massive impact that tastes in the 7th and 8th centuries had on what Greek and Roman literature survived into the middle ages and thus to the modern day. 

Which made me wonder about Taelgar's document tradition and its impact on what survives now. I haven't given it much thought, but for example do the elves have parchment or paper from the beginning? When do humans on Hkar develop parchment and books?

Partially just idle thoughts, but partially matters for e.g. set dressing for Drankor. Are there lots of ancient books lying around in Drankor carried over from Hkar, for example? Is catastrophes the main source of knowledge loss, or do you have the same kind of document decay as in the real world, or some combination? 

Just kind of curious meanderings, in case you have any thoughts.

Villa of the Papyri

It is named after its unique library of papyri scrolls, discovered in 1750. The Villa was considered to be one of the most l...

I do think there are a lot of catastrophies though - so there is no clear need for document decay per se.

[7/7/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
Idea for refactoring items, based on thinking about magic items in Taelgar.

1) Magic items are typically created based on using specific semi-magical objects to bind/capture extraplanar energy, typically much easier at an extraplanar weak point. In general, this means that to create a magic item, you generally need to know the formula, in some ways analgous to spells.

2) Magic items have the same power law as spellcasters, so most magic items are common, and very few are exceptionally strong. However, while all artifacts have some kind of story, that doesn't mean a common item can't have a story. 

Separately a mechanical level, there is a reason to make the world conform to some general D&D rules. Most non-legendary, non-artifact magic items in D&D sourcebooks shouldn't be unique mechanically Taelgar, and the lore of magic items should have it make sense that certain items tend to be easy to find.


[7/7/2024 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
From this I can think of a few things that are maybe worth thinking about.

1) Some items -- Drankorian Sending Stones; Skaer masterwork weapons; Lakan monastery extradimensional storage -- have "standard" D&D mechanics (mostly) but are in-world part of a specific workshop tradition. These feel interesting and useful to track


[7/7/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
So far in my game the basic pattern has been‚Ä¶ 

Most items are fairly similar to specific D&D items, but often not in the exact form..

Ie a ring that has the same game effect as a pearl of power (rather than a pearl)

Also, I‚Äôve usually made up some brief history even for ‚Äúcommon‚Äù magic items, and I haven‚Äôt shied away from simple made up items, i.e an amulet with three stones each of which heals


[7/7/2024 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
(You can see this in my Cleenseau treasure folder)


[7/7/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
2) Some items -- a pearl of power is a good example -- are well known formula that recur, but at least so far are not things that come from a "workshop tradition". But these are not explicitly unique items, and would in world be broadly considered "the same" from an arcane perspective


[7/7/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
3) Some items are truly unique. They are creations that you wouldn't expect to see again, and have some unique creation story. Some of these are powerful artifacts (Ring of Undying, e.g.), others might be less powerful but still unique (Delwath's shield, naragil)


[7/7/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
Note that one might reuse the mechanics of a unique item in some circumstances, but from an in world mechanical perspective it would be a different formula in some sense


[7/7/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
The lore thing I'm most interested in is the distinction between 1 and 2.

In an obsidian context, I would likely want to always have a page for (1) and (3). 
(a) a page for "Drankorian sending stones" but not pages for each representative, unless there was meaningful history to track
(b) a page for any item in category #3
(c) a page for any item in category #2 that had


[7/7/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
oops that was a bit garbled


[7/7/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea is you'd make pages for (1) and (3) always, but only for individual representatives of (1) or (2) if the story warranted it


[7/7/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but I'm not sure if this matches with your magic item creation workflow

[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
Ie a Drankorian shield that was unearthed or a Sembaran war hammer that was buried with a knight or whatever


[7/7/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Magic items have mostly had a specific ‚Äúancient‚Äù source in my game so far


[7/7/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
But I think the general ideas you outlined make sense, except I think I‚Äôve leaned into a little bit more creativity and likelihood for group #2


[7/7/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think in that context your magic items are much "cleaner" from an obisidian point of view. if each item has a clear history then it likely deserves its own page (if only for campaign notes type info) and how it was created doesn't necessarily matter.


[7/7/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but you guys have a lot of magic items without a clear history, or just vague notes about who created it (since by default that is the easiest thing to improvise in the mirror if I at least know where and when it was created)


[7/7/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Right. From a notes perspective your division makes sense


[7/7/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
for example I will probably make a page for the Urskan monster part trade but not make individual pages for everything you bought in the market in Zvervinka


[7/7/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Also it is probably useful to think about some common archetypes, other than bags of holding / sending stones / Skaer weapons


[7/7/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Yes this makes a lot of sense to me

Going to think about this a bit -- if Kate is into her book I might work on item refactor tonight


[7/7/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
I think I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily assume the D&D rules are exactly the common formulas though. Ie I introduced an amulet with one-time healing abilities which was described as an embodied miracle of the Mother passed down as a family heirloom. I can imagine things like that being common-ish in Sembara


[7/7/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
right, it doesn't have to strictly connect to mechanics or D&D sourcebooks


[7/7/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
But actually thinking about those categories helps refine items. For example
Boots of false tracks are pretty common. Why? Could be fun to make up and then just make a page for the general item


[7/7/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[7/7/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
some could be just that weak effects are easy to create, but others could be a specific reason. e.g, the Dunmari army during the Dharajun Dynasty made a large number of horn of silent alarms and so they are commonly found around Dumar and typically date to the Great War and immediately pre-Great War era

doing a major rework of items. kind of into it. pushing as I go in case you are interested.

one question: I assume you don't really care if you can figure out what items I have backstory invented for. my plan is to significantly trim secrets, and generally make pages for anything that has a notable secret even if the item itself might not otherwise warrant a page.


[7/7/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
no, I don't care

it isn't quite done, but the magic item rework in obsidian is shaping to do the following:
1) make pages for everything that is either (a) a specific item, whether unique or not, with a story; or (b) a generic class of items, such as "Drankorian message stones" or "dragonhide armor"
2) move all secrets for the Dunmar campaign to individual item pages or to "hoard pages", which would be the summary of all the items from a particular adventure or arc
3) clean up party treasure to be easier to read and edit

one issue so far is that we currently don't have a clear way to distinguish between types of items and specific items. currently this is just by folder, with things/magic items being generic things that have many copies in the world (workshop items from previous discussion), and things/artifacts of power or dunmar frontier/treasure/notable items having unique things (whether actually unique or historically/lore unique).

not sure if there is a better way to do this


[7/11/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
there probably is but I don't have time to think about it this week


[7/11/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
realistically, for "item types" you probably don't have whereabouts, creator, etc


[7/11/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus

I've been playing around a bit with https://dicecloud.com/ as an alternative to D&D Beyond (because I find homebrewing in D&D beyond annoying and my players have a bit of an anti-WOTC vibe, so we were talking about alternatives)...

And it got me thinking about languages a little bit. In my game, I have a house rule that makes it much easier to have new languages and learn new languages, so I was thinking refactoring the language docs a bit


[7/15/2024 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôve stated a little side project trying to reorganize the many different brainstorming docs out the broad historical outlines of taelgar into a single more canonical doc. Just fyi

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/15/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
At the moment it‚Äôs mostly just moving stuff around. So far there are a couple of open questions:

1. Were the orcs created at the same time as the elder folk (as the main background history of Taelgar says) or were they created at the same time as humans and hobgoblins (as a mythic history brainstorming doc suggests)


[7/15/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
2. Should anything at all about the southerners (other than ‚Äúthey existed‚Äù be considered canonical?) I‚Äôd prefer to leave them out except as a ‚Äúthe southerners existed what happened to them tbd‚Äù


[7/15/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
3. Is there a firm date for the creation of humans?


[7/15/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
For (1), I don't think there is a canonical answer. I haven't spent much time on the history of the non-People of the Rainbow orcs. Either is plausible, and the metaphysics of how exactly the Void Mind and the Despairs etc work is not clear. There is a certain logic to having all the "elder folk/children of embodied divinities" appear at the same time, but I'm not sure there is a need to be fully committed to parallelism


[7/15/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I imagine this is not really known even among elven scholars -- even if the orcs were created early, they didn't really have a big impact until later -- so probably reasonable to leave it as unknown until more detail is needed. 

Certainly the people of the rainbow don't really maintain tales or myths from their chained days, and so for them their creation story is about the Cloudspinner


[7/15/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
For (2), per Milo's story, rumors of them surely exist in Chardon among other places. So it is more "they exist but no one really goes there because it is too hard so news is all garbled"


[7/15/2024 9:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I can just mention both possibilities with a ‚Äúwho knows what really happened‚Äù. Makes sense to me


[7/15/2024 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
For (3), I think there should be but I'm not quite sure what it should be. Something like 1500-1700 maybe?


[7/15/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
There are dates ranging for 1500-2400 in various docs


[7/15/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
I was leaning toward something like 1750-1850


[7/15/2024 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
1850 gives ~2200 years of human culture before the downfall which feels about right


[7/15/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
Be a little earlier might also make sense? 1550 = 2500 years


[7/15/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
the religious history of taelgar doc has I think the most canonical thinking about pre-Downfall humanity, through a religious lens


[7/15/2024 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
(as an aside, did we ever finalize Deno'qai funerary traditions?)


[7/15/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, for human history, I think that the "era of personal deities" feels like it could easily be 1000 years of relative stasis. not much arcane magic development, not much urbanization, pretty idyllic


[7/15/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
for dating, the only real information is that the philosopher's guild suggests the binding stones are more than 3000 years old


[7/15/2024 9:52 PM] .deciusmus
The only real thing we have is the  ‚Äútraditions around death‚Äù doc


[7/15/2024 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
the events in described the philosopher's letter probably take place in the early pantheonic days, or perhaps the small gods era, hard to say precisely. but that puts that kind of transitory period at or before say ~2800


[7/15/2024 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
do we have dates for mariner migrations?


[7/15/2024 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
tollen is founded 3902


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing canonical I think but I haven‚Äôt gotten that far and am not at my computer.


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so mariner migrations must be a few hundred years before that at least


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
probably more


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure we need to settle this tonight - i have more session prep to do anyway - but probably something like 1500-1700 is more correct for human origin than the later dates. 2400 is definitely too late, not enough history on Hkar before migrations IMO


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So let‚Äôs say 3500 or earlier. Probably first explorers 3300


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah agreed no need to settle right now


[7/15/2024 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
my vision of human history on Hkar is that it is largely driven by developments in magic. so when everyone has a personal deity things don't change much, everyone has a bit of magic that makes life pretty comfortable (although some people create curses and bring the nine hells into existence)


[7/15/2024 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
this continues for a long while, potentially. but once arcane magic comes you get the rapid development of the hkar urban culture, the split with the mariners, etc


[7/15/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
But as a strawman maybe something like:

- 1500 creation
- 2250-2500 northerners
- 2800-2900 earliest pantheons
- 3300 - mariners start
- 3400 - mariners peak
- 3500 - mariners end


[7/15/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
But with the northerners and pantheon dates perhaps moved a bit or a lot


[7/15/2024 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, something like that is fairly reasonble as a rough starting point to work out. mariners might shift a bit later depending on how long it takes them to found tollen (not sure it would take 500 years to settle the length of the green sea, that seems a bit excessive)


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. It depends on how long they spend mucking about in the magic islands having religious schisms


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
downfall is like 4100 or thereabouts


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[7/15/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
It‚Äôs probably worth leaving the exact mariner dates a little vague in case we need more time for them wandered around in the far east

I went with 1520 for the date of creation just to have something


[7/16/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
just playing around with this a bit, I think this timeline isn't quite right.  The idea is that there is explosive change in Hkar in the aftermath of the northerners leaving and encountering the Elder Folk, but 300-400 years for the development of the earliest pantheons seems too long


[7/16/2024 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
the only firm date we have is Sargon was defeated no later than ~2800. (So that the philosopher's "more than 3000 years ago" works). But no reason it couldn't have been 2500 or 2200 even, right?


[7/16/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, maybe the northerners left later? like 2600


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah any of those options works. Decision is about the balance of time in the various phases of hkaran history.  There are enough unknowns that it seems a bit hard to pin down


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
on the one hand, no reason to decide


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
on the other hand, some arbitrary decisions help sometimes


[7/16/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
at the moment, I am thinking something like:

~300 years of "personal deities" era. 
~700 years of "small gods" era

Northerner migration is the ending of the small god era

~200 years of rapid change

~1500 years of the pantheonic era


[7/16/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not really sure if that is right. It's hard to know how rapidly the pantheonic era should conslidate


[7/16/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
into Mos Numena


[7/16/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I think one consideration is that to a certain extent, this plays into the question of why the downfall happens. 

The original conception from high school was supposed to be kind of opposed to the Tolkien mythic history of "humans are punished for challenging the gods" type thing. So the Downfall doesn't happen because humans get greedy, it happens because of evil gods or the Void Mind or whatever tbd forces. It happens to humans, basically, more like a natural disaster. 

I think this, to a certain extent, argues for a relatively shorter pantheonic era. If the Void Mind is trying to stop humans, the Hkaran urban elite is developing high magic and cooperating with elves, why wait?


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I mean, I definitely like the vibe of the Downfall as a "from the outside" disaster


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
But the Void Mind might need to wait to gain strength


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, there are possible reasons why it could happen anytime, of course


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. grow the hobgoblin armies in secret or whatever


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
If the Sargon date is going to stay canonical there isn't really room to make the pantheonic era much shorter than 1500 years


[7/16/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Because I think it should definitely be true that the transition from small gods to pantheons is short


[7/16/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it makes a ton of sense for their to be a long period of "proto pantheons" that Sargon can fit into. Right?


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
well, what there is no information about is what the Chainshroud actually was. Sarqon could be a full-fledged god worshipped by a cult.


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
I guess Sargon could be a 'big small god'


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
The other constraint is that the northern migration needs time, once it happens, to spread across Taelgar and diversify


[7/16/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
So I think the northerners can't be too early


[7/16/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
* i mean too late


[7/16/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, my thought is that there is effectively one period of rapid change in Hkar: the evolution from small gods to big pantheonic gods.

And that this period of rapid change should be:
* Short (100 - 300 years, but probably closer to 100 than 300)
* Soon after the Northerners leave and the humans and Elder Folk start interacting


[7/16/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
So, rereading the religious history doc, I feel like the era of personal deities/cults and the early pantheonic stages could last for quite a long time. the small gods -> pantheons does need to happen quickly


[7/16/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
for example, I'm not sure why "In a variety of ways, the era of cults quickly becomes an era of small gods. It likely starts with ancestor worship - if your mother was a powerful divine sorcerer, and you benefitted from her personal deity in life, it would be very natural to continue praying to her personal deity in death." has to be true


[7/16/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, the era of cults is kind of undeveloped


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I'm not sure it matters when the transition from personal deities to cults is


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Similarly, the transition from "early pantheonic" to "proto-Mos-Numena" can be anytime


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
what does seem clear is that the small gods is an important but brief transitory period, and a lot of things happen:
- northern migrations
- contact with elder folk
- arrival of arcane magic in force


[7/16/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
The thing that impacts everything else is basically when does the small gods -> early pantheonic transition happen


[7/16/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure if the small gods period has to be brief. You could have a short cult phase and a long small god phase, for example


[7/16/2024 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
so there are actually some conflicted metaphysics about the outer planes and the religious history docs


[7/16/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., where do places like Arborea and the Nine Hells come from? they are supposed to be kind of inchoate belief from the early days but this conflicts a bit with the idea that it isn't until the early pantheonic days that people start imaging  extraplanar divinities


[7/16/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, that is neither here nor there for dating


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
in my mind, the northerner migration, contact with elder folk, spread of arcane magic, and the pantheonic tradition are all tied together and happen in a relatively short window


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. Strongly agree


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
say within about 200-500 years max


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/16/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
so how much history is about right for the northerners on the main continent?


[7/16/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
And of course this needs to be during the "small gods" era, but it could be that small gods only lasts 200-300 years and overlaps almost entirely with the "transition" period.

Or it could be that small gods lasts 1000 years and ends with the migrations


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
There needs to be enough time that Zimka/Vos are well established in Sembara when the mariners show up


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
I think that's the main constraint really


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't necessarily take the northerners that much time to get there


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
But the world isn't _that_ big. It could probably be as little as 800 years and as many as 1800


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
which says, say 2100 - 3100


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if Tollen is founded in 3902 that implies mariners make it to Western Gulf by say 3700 at the earliest? Tollen is supposed to be one of the first mariner cities in that part of the Green Sea


[7/16/2024 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
I was using the founding of Tollen as the function "point of contact" but probably 100 years before is better


[7/16/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
give the Zimka like 8-10 generations minimal in the highlands before then only pushes their arrival back to 3100ish? plus/minus a hundred years


[7/16/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
sorry wrong math, more like 3400


[7/16/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so assume very roughly 800-1000 years to migrate, you could have northerns make first contact with continent around 2400-2600


[7/16/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Although I think 1000 years is a very long time to migrate. There are all kinds of reasons they might have been moving faster


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right but doesn't mess anything up for them to have been in the region for 20-30 generations, or 100 generations


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
I'd stick with my the migration should probably not be before 2000 or after 3000 but anything else could work


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yes I think that is good


[7/18/2024 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
Did you push any notes on this yet?


[7/18/2024 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
in the history-rewrite branch


[7/18/2024 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
I didn't want to do it in main because I was doing a lot of deleting and moving wanted to be able to review a diff to make sure I deleteing the right stuff


[7/18/2024 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure if I got this exactly captured


[7/18/2024 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
I have a session in 1.5 weeks and am mostly switching my taelgar focused stuff to session prep for a bit


[7/18/2024 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus
I need to finally actually develop drankor ha ha so working on a lot of history over the next couple of weeks, fwiw


[7/18/2024 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
you should definitely look at my history-rewreite


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i am tempted to rewrite a little to move away from the Tolkien-esque "elder folk" "elder days" "ages of the world" framework


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
I was pretty tempted to get rid of the whole "5th age"


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that seems pointless. it was originally an idea for elven timekeeping before we came up with the ka cycle


[7/18/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
right, I guess with the ka cycle why would elves have some different "ages" concept? i mean, I guess you might refer to some set of ka by a name, but that would be very elvish


[7/18/2024 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
so really, you can imagine a mythic structure that is basically

"Time before time"
"Time before humans"
"History"


[7/18/2024 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
But it might be good to have a term to refer to the first two categories... whether that uses the word "Age" I'm not sure


[7/18/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
well, i guess the real idea is that from a metaphysical point of view, there is just the "Mythic Age" (before time) and "History". but that doesn't mean that scholars wouldn't make up names. So from a human point of view, you might have the Hkaran Era and the Drankorian Era


[7/18/2024 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
and humans might actually consider the Mythic Age to be everything pre-existence of humans


[7/18/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I was thinking from the perspective of a Drankorian scholar you'd have

the time before time
the time before humans
the Hkaran Era
the current time

from the perspective of a Chardonian scholar, you'd add

the time before time
the time before humans
the Hkaran Era
the Drankorian Era
the current time

but actually the real dividing point is probably the fall of Drankor, not the fall of Cha'mutte


[7/18/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
from a "making stuff up" point of view, the difference between the time before humans the Hkaran Era is small


[7/18/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. in many ways the world building history is easier if we don't think of the creation of humans as some "New Age!!!" but just an event


[7/18/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
that avoids eg feeling like the timing of orcs or hobgoblins has to be related to some "age transition"


[7/18/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think from a worldbuilding perspective there are really three substantial eras:
- before the planes are separated by the Riving
- between the Riving and the Downfall
- between the Downfall and the current day


[7/18/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
right


[7/18/2024 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that the Age of Myth, the Age of Creation, and the Age of Humanity are reasonable worldbuilding internal names but each could conceivably have different names in different cultures as well, tbd. to the extent to which we want to invest in that kind of worldbuilding.


[7/18/2024 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
right. that probably makes sense too, and is a slightly different dividing line (i.e. presuming the Age of Creation ends with the creation of Humans)


[7/18/2024 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
or you could imagine the Age of Humanity divided into the Hkaran Era, the Drankorian Era, and the post-Drankorian Era


[7/18/2024 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
again, from a worldbuilding-internal naming standpoint mostly


[7/18/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
one idea I had that i'm not sure about is that the downfall is actually the end of the age of creation, and rather than having a bunch of "void mind" races lingering in the shadows and growing in strength for a thousand years, you basically have wars break out kind of suddenly, and really have for the first time in history (since the riving) the concept of large scale war.


[7/18/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
the downfall is basically the last gasp of the void mind to destroy the work of the age of creation


[7/18/2024 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
and something about the downfall is actually significantly more mythically/metaphysically real, it locks into a place a bunch of metaphysics and further restricts magic in some way. maybe moving the outer planes even further from the material plane or something.


[7/18/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea of downfall being metaphysically significant... but I also like the elves having this long period of wariness and empire building... and the current semi-canon for the dwarven split is those who want to fortify the underground vs those who want to flee the underground


[7/18/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
So there could be advantages to having a long slow buildup


[7/18/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
If gnomes only left in the 200 years before the downfall or something they should be more well known across taelgar, right?


[7/18/2024 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess my thought is those kinds of premonitions are more interesting if it is really a magical thing: elmerica is warning the elves of something new, all consuming war, that the that world has never seen; maybe before this time the Warrior of the Bahrazel is something else, not the Warrior, and it is during this time a cult of the Warrior grows up among the dwarves, some thinking this is dangerous and terrible and others believing their crazy stories


[7/18/2024 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus
the dangerous and terrible folks lose and leave, and dwarven society starts inventing armies


[7/18/2024 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I don't disagree, but it seems odd to have the premonitions 1000 years before anything bad happens


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
Even elves aren't going to plan for 1000 years in the future


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
no, but the firstborn don't know when exactly something bad is going to happen


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
its like e.g. early christian predictions about the end of the world or something


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
right, I mean, if the premonitions start in 2000 and the wars don't erupt until 3800 that's a long time to be having faith in the premonitions


[7/18/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
It has a very different flavor than the premonitions start in 2000 and are proven true in 2150 or 2200


[7/18/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
in, actually, a not dissimilar way to christian evolution of the end of the world as being seen as less and less "mainstream" as it kept not happening


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
doesn't mean that can't be what happened, I just think it changes the flavor in a way I'm not sure I love


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, yes, this is part of why the downfall is so bad. if all of elven society believed that war was going to break out in 100 years they'd have been better prepared and all their empires wouldn't have been lost


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
thats a good point


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
the circle I'm trying to square is basically how badly the non-humans lose


[7/18/2024 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
i mean obviously on some level they win but at massive cost. so why weren't they more prepared?


[7/18/2024 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
What if you have something like...
(a) Both the dwarven and elven firstborn have these major premonitions of disaster, but like, in 2000 or even 1500. A long time before the downfall wars
(b) At first, both societies largely accept them, and start preparing for war
(c) After a hundred years of nothing happening, starts to be schisms. Gnomes split. Disagreement amongst the elves
(d) Say after another hundred years, small cracks that let in creatures from the Far Realms into the deeps start to appear
(e) this is nothing "earth shattering" and doesn't really impact elves at all, but it is enough to entrench the dwarven warrior thruh and it becomes this kinda smallish group who defends the deep from the occasional aberration


[7/18/2024 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
Then 1000+ years pass, and the elves who accept the possibility of danger have become something like a small cult of sorts, the watchers or whatever


[7/18/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
Probably needs a bit of work, but I feel like the "isolated watchers not quite believed" works better for elves than dwarves


[7/18/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
Not sure what stoneborn/halflings/lizardfolk are doing all this time


[7/18/2024 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
yes. in my sentient ocean history, canonically the riving is supposed to open cracks to the far realms, and while it would in theory take some time for e.g. mind flayers to show up those make sense as the "first enemies"


[7/18/2024 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus
I like this. you also have things like undead, and maybe lycanthropy, and a few other evils. greedy dragons and the like, and maybe some remnant giant populations who see small folk as lesser. so it isn't like the world is missing conflict. but you really don't have "war", except deep in the underdark where dwarves fight mind flayers and other strange aberrations


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
there is just enough danger so that the watcher elves or whatever aren't completely unbelievable, but the idea that a few undead or a greedy dragon would spawn vast armies seems difficult to believe


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
And in particular, nothing like the "First Age of Elves on Middle Earth in the long fortified war against Morgoth" vibe


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
I like that


[7/18/2024 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
One thought. Does the Void Mind lose because of the efforts of the firstborn races, or is it something else?

Is the Void Mind winning until somehow a trap is set on Hkar, and massive armies of hobgoblins and orcs and whatever else all sail to Hkar and then the place is sunk to destroy the armies?

Or is the "mainland" battles more even, or at least not quite so hopeless?


[7/18/2024 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
What if there is something specific about Hkar that empowers the divine spark


[7/18/2024 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
I've always kind of imaged the destruction of Hkar as a trap, yes


[7/18/2024 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
but nothing canonical in this regard


[7/18/2024 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
Here's an alternative idea though...

When the Divine Presence creates Hkar + the humans, there is literally something metaphysical of themselves that is embedded in Hkar or a part of Hkar. This strengthens and empowers the divine spark in the humans.

During the Downfall Wars, the agents of the Void Mind learn of this, and realize if they can possess and corrupt this whatever, they can destroy and corrupt everything that was imagined with the divine spark, perhaps even humanity itself, and dramatically weaken the Divine Prescene. End the ability to create, at some level.


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
And although the battle is still raging, and the Void Mind forces haven't won, it is too much of a risk. And so the Divine Prescence takes back this whatever which sinks Hkar


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
And metaphysically, makes them farther away from Taelgar, and makes the creation of new gods harder


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
weakens divine magic.


[7/18/2024 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
i think there is something in that


[7/18/2024 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
i think actually that cleans up a lot of the complications of the outer planes -- e.g. why is their a fixed set of outer planes and why are some not associated with deities?


[7/18/2024 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
It needs work, I think, but it plays back into the idea that the earlier and closer the humans are to Hkar, the easier it is to create gods. This explains why there are not so many new religions always forming (and maybe even the mariners too something of this power with them, which is why the east has more divine magic and more religions in general)


[7/18/2024 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not totally sure I want to say that *no* new gods appear after the downfall, but I think it works very well to have an "easy" era of god formation transition to a "hard" era. and that no new *planes* are formed after the downfall, perhaps excepting divine realms


[7/18/2024 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
(although metaphyiscally I think divine realms and non-divine outer planes are somewhat distinct)


[7/18/2024 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
and making that power embedded in the physical location of Hkar itself works well to explain Hkar's destruction


[7/18/2024 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
Right and it could explain some of the earliest outer planes


[7/18/2024 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus
and also perhaps why the elven empire that was in dunmar gets decimated. hobgoblin armies cut down hundreds of thousands of trees to construct a massive armanda


[7/18/2024 11:40 AM] .deciusmus
maybe in the first generation of humans, born themselves with the divine spark, and living on Hkar at the center of this magic literalyl create planes with their dreams. 

So places like Abyss/Hell/Aborea are the planes created by the dreams of the very first generation of humans.


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
then *populated* by the divine familiars created by the later generations?


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
not sure about that...


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
right, I like that


[7/18/2024 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
I gotta go do some work. but the other thing to think about is the vibe of the elves & other firstborn races....

At the end of the Downfall wars is it more like:

that was terrible but we won by our actions OR

that was terrible and we would have all been wiped out if Hkar didn't sink


[7/18/2024 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
(my instinct says the first is better, but not sure)


[7/18/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
I think my idea of the vibe of the downfall based on this new idea of the void mind wanting to corrupt hkar is that "without our actions, hkar would have been overwhelmed, but ultimately without the sinking of hkar the war could never have ended"

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/18/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
so basically, destruction of hkar was a necessary cost, but without the price paid by the firstborn, probably the armies that reached hkar would have achieved their goal and captured the divine spark or whatever before hkar could be destroyed. something like that


[7/18/2024 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i have a bunch of meetings this afternoon but am going to try to rewrite the history of taelgar doc on the rewrite branch with these ideas

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/18/2024 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
have not got very far due to actual work, but throwing out this thought for comment, will likely pick up some more on this later today.

i think that the extraplanar geography needs a bit of rearranging. 

energy realms make total sense and I like the traditional D&D 5e Elemental Planes. The ethereal plane and the plane of magic connect nicely here. 

echo realms make total sense as well, although the shadowfell might need a little bit of thought. it isn't obvious that fey need two planes, and it is a natural locus for undead, so might make more sense as an undead plane in a sense, but need to think about that in the context of the metaphysics of death. 

however i'm increasingly feeling like the outer planes don't really work. there are canonically as many as perhaps four categories of "outer planes":
(1) the realms of the embodied gods, of which the dwarven Heart of the Mountain is the most well established
(2) the realms of incorporeal gods, of which Shakun's realm is the clearest, but which also canonically are not always a separate realm for each deity, e.g. Arkaash is supposed to be the realm of the Dunmari Pantehon
(3) what I've called the "primal realms": Arborea, the Abyss, Pandemonium, others. These are explicity not associated with deities, or at least not with the Divine Presence (but e.g. Pandemonium might be associated with Jinnik)
(4) the Dreamworld, the Land of the Dead, the Plane of Souls don't fit obviously into this, although it is canonically established that you can reach the Dreamworld via the Plane of Souls, and the Land of the Dead is a "dividing line" somehow for divine power
(5) the Astral Plane, which might not even exist? Or might be connected to the Plane of Souls and/or the Dreamworld


[7/18/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I think probably separating out the Primal Realms (with perhaps a different name) and associating these with the Riving, perhaps involving some Void Mind shenanigans, is much more straightforward than trying to force these things into the Divine Realms / Spiritual Realms


[7/18/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
then the embodied gods, incorporeal gods, dreamworld, land of dead, plane of souls are all "Age of Creation" things layered on top of the metaphysical structure created by the RIving


[7/18/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
and this also potentially creates space for e.g. undead to leak from the shadowfell, or lycanthropes from Pandemonium, or demons from the Abyss, in the age of creation


[7/18/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
I found the early campaign ‚Äúhell is made by humans because you imagine it‚Äù vibe kinda appealing. But it is potentially hard to fit into a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean there doesn't have to be a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôve never been happy with Shadowfell, honestly and it seems kinda odd. Didn‚Äôt you run a one shot for Riswynn in the Shadowfell or was that somewhere else?


[7/18/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the way the shadowfell has worked so far is not as a permanent echo realm but more like "domains of dread" like Ravenloft. mini-echo-realms created by some powerful trauma/evil/whatever


[7/18/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is kind of like fey domains in that the boss controls the vibe and the terrain echoes the material world, but very unlike in that you generally can't straightforwardly just walk across the borders


[7/18/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
and theoretically you could have mulitple overlapping shadowfell domains echoing the same spot


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that is more interesting and consistent with taelgar metaphysics than any kind of permanent equivalent of the feywild just in reverse


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but still thinking


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i have a meeting now but more later


[7/18/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
RIght I like that a lot - Shadowfell per se doesn't exist, and perhaps there isn't even a specific word/language/culture/whatever.... But there are a bunch of shadowy/dark echo realms, with a kind-of anti-life vibe...

That fits well with Delwath's backstory as well


[7/18/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
A few thoughts for later..

(1) Agree on energy realms / plane of magic / etheral plane from the Riving
(2) Agree on Shadowfell not fey & not a thing but more a type of mini-echo realm
(3) Not sure about undead. Do undead really need a plane? It seems to me that they are very much a material plane phenomena. Doesn't mean a vampire or lich couldn't create a "shadowfell" domain of dread, but I don't think that the undead really need a "home plane" in any sense
(4) Agree that the core "divine" realms and the core "primal" realms should be thought of separately. 
(5) Agree that the Dreamworld/Land Of Dead/Plane of Souls needs separate thought


[7/18/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Some questions:

(a) how does a divine realm come to be? I don't know the answer but my instinct says that the embodied gods & the incorporeal gods probably create them the same way. I think if it is in some sense under the gods control that explains a lot of the differences, i.e. Shakun created her own realm for Reasons rather than joining the realm of the Dunmari family, which was one realm for Reasons. 
(a - 1) if the gods create the divine realms, that kinda means that until the pantheonic era, there were no divine realms for humans
(a - 2) how does this relate to souls, which are pretty well established as "returning to their deity" after death in some fashion
(a - 3) how does this relate to small gods ideas of death, where there is no divine realm?
(a - 4) what about Thark and other embodied void mind gods. Can they create divine realms as well?


[7/18/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
(b) What is the Plane of Souls / Dreamworld / Land of Dead and when was it created? 

The canon we have so far suggests that the Plane of Souls and Dreamworld are closely connected, and also closely connected to the *living*. The plane of souls is like an echo realm almost, but just echoing the souls of those who are alive on taelgar. (Maybe it is an echo realm, creating in the Riving?)

The Dreamworld is has very little canon to it, other than as a place of imagination/dreams/possibilities. I used it in my game once as a place where the party was trapped during a cursed sleep. 

Here's what we wrote in college, which actually still feels kinda right:

The Dreamworld: The Dreamworld is an echo, shadow, and premonition of Taelgar.¬† The Dreamworld is a realm that contains echoes of the present, past, and future blended together.¬† Prophecy, and the ability to sense the past associations of an object are strongly tied to connections to the Dreamworld.¬† The Dreamworld can also, under the influence of a powerful master, be used to send messages, influence dreams, and similar things.¬† It is at once a part of, and not a part of, Taelgar.

So thinking about this a bit when I should be working it feels like metaphysically, the Plane of Souls and the Dreamworld are really a sort of echo realm, and probably created in the Riving, and actually might be very different from the land of the dead


[7/18/2024 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure this long stream of conscious is helpful, but what about something like the following....

(1) In the aftermath of the Riving, the planes are separated, and at least the Energy Realms, Ethereal Realm, Plane of Magic, and the Echo Realms (including the Feywild, the Dreamworld, the Plane of Souls, plus any other random planes like the Mirror Realm and the rumored Nightmare Realm) are created. Plus of course the Material Plane

(2) the embodied gods create their divine realms as they see fit, as they are created. TBD is what about the Void Mind gods, and can they create realms to? Probably yes, but they might not all want to, given the void mind vibe.

(3a) maybe the Land of the Dead is explicitly created as a buffer between the gods and Taelgar during the Downfall, in response to the Void Mind attacks? That could be a mechanism for explaining why it became harder for belief to create gods. (Although this might be too big a change and not quite fit the already established religious history). (3b) Alternatively, maybe the Land of the Dead is in some sense part of the creation of humans. So before the land of the dead, the firstborn souls were taken up by their gods directly from Taelgar.


[7/18/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like the implications of (3b) that unleashing the divine spark into the multiverse had other consequences


[7/18/2024 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
Ok..here's a story. What do you think?

In the beginning, magic was all there was. In the Age of Myth before time, there was no life or death, per se, no mortality, and no souls. Magic fueled everything, and time didn't have meaning. Everything that lived at this time was in some sense a being of pure magic.

Then, in the Riving, as the magic of the multiverse was being ordered into the Energy & Ethereal & Magic Planes, the Divine introduced something new: souls. Not made of magic, but something else, that have never existed before.

And the embodied gods & the plane of souls were both shaped out of soul stuff, this new thing. And the embodied gods used the power of their soul stuff to guide and create living beings from the soul stuff in the plane of souls, and shape a new kind of life. As the first souls died, and drifted back to the plane of souls, the embodied gods recognized their work, and swept their souls up, and built realms for them, also out of soul stuff


[7/18/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
This continued for a while (and as an aside, Thark fits in nicely here as perverse creation, not really made of soul stuff at all, not properly, and so he is only able to steal the soul stuff from the other gods and chain and bind it, not create it himself)...

And then the Divine created humans. Humans were a new thing again, made of soul stuff but without a creator or guide, with the power of their soul stuff to shape things intact, rather than skimmed by the embodied gods (this sounds like I'm making Cha'mutte's point, embodied gods as leechs)...

And the Divine made the land of the dead for them, so the human soul stuff could have a place to go when it died. And when the early humans died, before their were any gods, they imagined out of their own soul stuff, the primal realms


[7/18/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
So the history of the planes is basically 3 events:

(a) the Riving establishes the Echo/Energy/Ethereal Realsm
(b) in the same moment as the Riving, the creation of souls establishes the Plane of Souls (and the Dreamworld, which is basically an echo plane of the Plane of Souls)
(c) at the time of creation of humans, the Land of the Dead is created

Then, all the "outer" planes (Primal + Spiritual) are built either by human belief, with the power of their soul-stuff, or by embodied or incorporeal gods, with the power of the soul-stuff of their dead followers

In the early days, the human souls were not flowing to any gods, so the primal planes came to be. But then, as the gods developed, human soul-stuff became more and more a purview of the gods, rather than free-floating human belief.

But in theory, metaphysically, if all the humans decided to stop believing/worshipping the gods, you'd go back to a time when human belief could create new primal planes


[7/18/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
need to think about this all a bit but a few additional points:
(1) Agree that that Dreamworld is functionally an echo realm of the Plane of Souls - I think this has been established in game already, early on actually in Kenzo's dream journey way back in Karawa. The key distinction between the Dreamworld and what I would call true echo realms is that the geography of the Dreamworld is not tied to the physical geography of the material plane. Shadowfell domains, the Feywild, and the MIrror Realm have, so far, been demonstrated to be geographic echoes (distorted perhaps) of the Material Plane
(2) Agree that the Land of the Dead is a dividing line of sorts, between the Plane of Souls / Material Plane / echo realms / whatever and the Divine Realms. This is established as well, at least in my secret notes if not in game, and is consistent with a lot of undead lore and lore around resurrection/raise dead etc. (it takes much stronger magic to bring back a soul that has 'passed on')


[7/18/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Not positive I agree that the Land of the Dead is a human thing / created originally for humans, and need to think about the primal realms as imagined by dead humans out of their soul stuff


[7/18/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure I agree with any of the above either; its more one potential idea that at least has a unifying mechanic


[7/18/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Going back to your questions, re: how does a divine realm come to be, I think this is "it is created by a divinity" and that the distinction between embodied and incorporeal gods here is not particularly meaningful. 

How this relates to souls and dead is, I think, fairly clear in my mind as well. The "Spiritual Realms" writ large are basically places where souls can exist, and if they don't eventually end up in one of the "Spiritual Realms", they fade from existence into nothingness. 

Re: Thark, at least in some sense this has to be yes, otherwise orcs from last session wouldn't believe they could poison him with their souls.


[7/18/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there is an unresolved question about the souls of humans who are not taken up by one of the major divinities with an extraplanar realm, and I think there is still an unresolved question about where the non-god-associated spiritual realms come from


[7/18/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
Re: Thark, I'm not sure Thark has to be able to create a divine realm for orcs to believe they can poison him, right? He just has to have some type of existence that is in  place they can reach him. Although a divine realm is probably simplest


[7/18/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
re: echo realms.

My thinking is that an echo realm is just a echo of the Riving, and, in some sense, could be an echo of something other than Taelgar. So the Dreamworld is an echo of the creation of the plane of souls or whatever.

Is it necessary to assume all echo realms are an echo of the plane of taelgar? Maybe dragons all live in some echo of the plane of magic.


[7/18/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
What's different about the echo realms is they are sorta created by accident. 

Whereas the energy realms are the separation of the stuff of the multiverse from before the Riving.

And the spiritual realms are created by divine beings, on purpose.

(primal realms TBD)


[7/18/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Agree on Echo realms vs Energy realms as you describe - no not all echo realms need to echo the material plane


[7/18/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I think "primal realms" is the wrong word FWIW, at least in some old notes I have 
Arcane magic = Energy realms, plane of magic
Divine magic = Spiritual Realms, Divine Presence
Primal magic = Echo realms, resonances of the Riving


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Interesting


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
but I agree


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
not committed to that as canonical but it is interesting and fits in at least with some centaur lore


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
"outer planes" is the best shorthard term for now, but clearly not the right taelgaresque term


[7/18/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. At some point we need to clarify a bit what fey magic is. Because eventually Kiya is going to want to know exactly how Celyn feels different when he casts a fey spell vs a divine spell


[7/18/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
But putting that aside, I agree that primal is the wrong word.


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Re: magic, I actually think in some ways my older notes are wrong, and there is no reason for such broad generalizations. All magic on Taelgar is the manipulation of extraplanar energy, yes. But mechanically, any player who cares can choose some reasonable source of extraplanar energy to be what they manipulate


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't mean to suggest that "primal" = "rangers and druids"


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Or at least, I didn't read it that way


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
More, I was thinking you meant "there is a 3rd kind of magical ressonance, from the echo realms, which is a different type of magic than arcane or divine"


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
in our high school notes we called this "the magic of Taelgar"


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, but what I'm suggesting is the idea that there are three categories is maybe wrong


[7/18/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
"Plane of Magic" magic and "Pray to Deity" magic are the most common and easiest, perhaps. But "feywild magic", "elemental plane magic", and "other outer plane" magic could all exist


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so if you wanted to play a storm sorcerer or something maybe you don't use traditional "arcane" magic from the plane of magic, but use "elemental magic" from the elemental planes


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
or a circle of dreams druid maybe uses "dreamworld magic"


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
right, I see.


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[7/18/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, a bit far afield from the original discussion. still going to try to type up the history notes, and maybe will try to incorporate some comments on the extraplanar stuff as `%% %%` notes


[7/18/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking about making a stab at updating the cosmology section briefly with this


[7/18/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure if we've agreed to anything


[7/18/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps just that Dreamworld/land of dead don't belong in Spiritual relams and that the Riving created at least

(a) energy + magic + ethereal
(b) dreamworld + plane of souls

And that the divine spiritual realms were crated by gods, separately
and that the primal realms should be renamed but we don't have a good alternate name


[7/18/2024 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
Also perhaps that the Shadowfell has nothing to do with the fey


[7/18/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe add some notes to the overall multiverse page. i'm not sure anything is settled enough to be worth revising the organization of the cosmology section yet


[7/18/2024 5:10 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is something to be said for "de-canonifying" the current division, i.e. by 
- moving stuff that isn't definitely a spirtual realm out of spiritual realms
- getting rid of "primal realms" as a catagory


[7/18/2024 5:11 PM] .deciusmus
might play around in a PR-branch


[7/18/2024 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
working a bit more on this and wondering about this:

The Riving is actually several ordered events, although the time between them is undefined as the linear progression of time doesn't really make sense until the Riving ends:

1) The Divine Presence separates the material plane from the energy and echo realms, making a place that, while not devoid of magic, is much more stable and safe.

2) The Divine Presence spins out from itself the raw material for souls, which are basically like little fragments of the divine, creating the Plane of Souls as a kind of undifferentiated swirl. 

3) The Divine Presence creates out of itself the Embodied Gods, and gives them the power to shape soul stuff, but creates the land of the dead as a barrier, limiting the ability of souls to influence the Divine Presence or act beyond the material plane. 

4) The Embodied gods use the soul stuff to create the elves, dwarves, etc, and create their personal domains beyond the land of the dead. This ends the Riving and starts the Age of Creation.


[7/18/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, the creation of humanity is the moment when the Divine Presence allows a break in the Land of the Dead. Humanity is given the divine spark to shape divinity. The incorporeal gods are created because of this barrier.


[7/18/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
The Downfall seals this barrier again, but quite completely


[7/18/2024 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
Actually implies separating the world out into four mythic eras again, with creation of humans as a dividing line, but I think neatly wraps some things up


[7/18/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
The period of time betwen the Creation of Humans and the Downfall is a period when it is relatively easy to create "outer planes". 

Some are created by human beliefs. Some are created by the Void Mind's agents, descendants, etc. Some maybe are created by strange and unlikely events.


[7/18/2024 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Afterward, after the Downfall, the metaphysical world is largely fixed. But the barrier is not **completely** sealed, to leave open the possibility of weird stuff, new gods, as needed


[7/18/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
I like the first part, but I don't think it needs to be a set of linearly ordered events exactly. Is causality even unidirectional in the Age of Myth? Aerin going back to before the Riving somehow creates kenku, right? Who says that order has meaning?


[7/18/2024 6:38 PM] .deciusmus
But sure, from a "untangling for ease of understanding" I like it


[7/18/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, I guess for ease of human minds to understand it makes sense to say in some way creation of the plane of souls and creation of embodied gods has to precede the creation of the elder folk but in metaphysical reality causality doesn't have to be unidirection


[7/18/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
So the mythic history becomes:

all magic, no souls
soul stuff created, but its influence is locked to Taelgar itself
door opened, soul stuff can influence the metaverse
oops, that's too dangerous, patch it up by the door can never be fully closed


[7/18/2024 6:41 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, yes


[7/18/2024 6:42 PM] rsulfuratus
what I like about it is that it allows for any random "outer plane" someone wants to make, and no reason for it fit into a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
Right so basically an ‚Äúouter plane‚Äù is just something created with soul stuff at some level


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
But each outer plane can / should have a specific origin story


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
I like that a lot actually


[7/18/2024 6:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that I would the astral plane basically the undifferentiated soulstuff beyond the land of the dead (while the plane of souls is the differentiated soulstuff on the material plane side of the land of the dead)


[7/18/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and then any plane made of soulstuff floats in the astral plane and has some kind of origin story


[7/18/2024 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm not convinces the astral plane needs to exist


[7/18/2024 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
Is it too religious-vibe to have soul stuff be the Divine Presence?


[7/18/2024 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is it too religious-vibe to have the soul stuff be the Divine Presence. And also is probably inconsistent with it being shaped into outer planes by Void Mind things


[7/18/2024 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is the Divine Presence imbuing some if its creative magic into something new


[7/18/2024 6:52 PM] rsulfuratus
also re: astral plane, I think it is useful to have a way to travel to the outer planes that isn't plane shift


[7/18/2024 6:52 PM] .deciusmus
Are elven , dwarven , and human souls different in some metaphysical way?


[7/18/2024 6:53 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't know but I'm not sure there is any reason for them to be


[7/18/2024 6:54 PM] .deciusmus
What about the idea that the divine presence basically creates the astral plane - the source of soul stuff - in imitation or learning from the plane of magic - and elves and dwarves and everyone else is created when the embodied gods pass the soul stuff from the astral plane to the plane of souls


[7/18/2024 6:55 PM] .deciusmus
Humans are the first souls that go freely in some sense which is why they have the divine spark


[7/18/2024 6:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i like that


[7/19/2024 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
pretty busy today but noodling a bit when I have time. Rewrote the summary as:

The **Age of Myth**, when the multiverse was new, a period before time itself was created. The Age of Myth begin with the first act of creation and are a time of the archfey, titans, elements, and great wyrms, a time when the power of arcane magic coursed unchecked through the multiverse and altering reality was as simple as a thought. This age ends with [[The Riving]] when the [[Divine Presence]] separates the planes of existence from each other and creates the [[Material Plane]]. This was a time of huge empires and incredible acts of magic, but also of much chaos.

The **Age of Creation** began after [[The Riving]], when the multiverse was created, and ended with the [[Creation of Humans]] and the breaking of the barriers that contained and constrained the creative force of ~soulstuff~. It was during the Age of Creation that the [[Elder Folk|oldest sentient species]] of Taelgar were created by [[Embodied Gods]], when the vast civilizations of [[elves]], [[Dwarves|dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and others spread across the world. This is the golden age of the non-human species, but also a time that lacked dynamism. Little changed or was truly new in this age, as the Firstborn of the Elder Folk encouraged sameness and uniformity.


[7/19/2024 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
The **Age of Divinity** began with the [[Creation of Humans]], and the shattering of the walls that isolated the [[Material Plane]] and kept the creative force of ~soulstuff~ from affecting the wider multiverse. Humans, created by the [[Divine Presence]] itself on [[Hkar]], were unlike anything that had come before, for they were granted the Divine Spark, the ability of their beliefs to shape the very reality of the multiverse, creating [[Incorporeal Gods]] out of the material of creation itself. This was an age of great change, as the greatest hopes and darkest fears of humanity were manifest in ~soulstuff~. It was also an age when other, darker things were created by the machinations of the [[Void Mind]]. The Age of Divinity ended with the the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the destruction of [[Hkar]], and the diminishment of the power of the Divine Spark on the [[Material Plane]]. 

The **Age of Humanity** began with the sinking of [[Hkar]] and the reshaping of the world that accompanied the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. This age saw the rise and fall of Drankor, and the rise and fall of Cha'mutte, and much growth and change among human cultures. This age saw, for the first time, humanity growing to dominant the cultures of Taelgar, and the history of this age is dominated by the history of humanity.

One comment:

> Throughout the long [[Age of Creation]], the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation, through which only the [[Embodied Gods]] could reach


[7/19/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure it matters, but is this metaphysically true? Also, if the barrier is truely strong, does that mean there are no clerics / divine magic until humans are created?


[7/19/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure the metaphysics of the barrier matter nor questions like where do souls come from.


[7/19/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
Implication is supposed to be that divine magic comes from the firstborn who can reach through. But agree probably not worth spending a ton of time on


[7/19/2024 1:15 PM] rsulfuratus
But metaphysically just supposed to set up the contrast with age of divinity when outer planes get created beyond those associated with embodied gods


[7/19/2024 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
right. might be worth clarifying the impact, i.e. (although secondarily, could the embodied gods reach through easily, i.e. unlike in the current age, could gods act more easily and directly on the world?)


Throughout the long [[Age of Creation]], the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation. Although the [[Embodied Gods]] could reach across this barrier, to grant miracles and change the Material Plane, the magic of souls could not act, except through the Embodied Gods.


[7/19/2024 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
Or something

re: multiverse, pushed this:

While there are many ways to describe the multiverse, the most widely known comes from elven scholars, who describe the multiverse a pair of intersecting domes: the below, the dome of the physical planes rising from the roiling chaos of the [[Plane of Magic]]; above, the dome of the planes of sentience, descending from the blinding intensity of the [[Plane of Creation]].  

The duality of the [[Material Plane]] -- the physical structures of the universe -- and the [[Plane of Souls]] -- the soul structures of the sentient inhabitants of the universe -- sit in the middle of these domes, the Material Plane anchored to the dome of physicality, the Plane of Souls anchored to the dome of sentience. 

Descending "below" the material plane in this cosmology is the [[Ethereal Plane]], which stretches from the border ethereal, co-localizing with the material plane, through the interior ethereal, a foggy expanse of swirling mists, to the deep ethereal, which bleeds into the [[Plane of Magic]]. Embedded within the "sea" of the [[Ethereal Plane]] are the [[Energy Realms]], chief among them the [[Elemental Planes]], domains of pure physicality, capturing the essence of the fundamental elements of the universe.


[7/19/2024 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
Floating "above" the plane of souls in this cosmology is the [[Astral Plane]], which is bisected by the [[Land of the Dead]], a collecting point for souls and an not-quite-impermeable barrier separating the raw energy of creation from the [[Material Plane]]. Beyond the [[Land of the Dead]], the [[Astral Plane]] is a strange empty expanse of silvery waves, in which the [[Spiritual Realms]] float like bubbles, until it merges with the blinding energy of the [[Plane of Creation]]. 

Layered on top of this cosmology, the elven scholars speak of the [[Echo Realms]], the distortions and reflections and reverberations of the planes created by [[The Riving]], which still resonance today. Most notably, these include the [[Feywild]], an echo of the material plane, and the [[Dreamworld]], an echo of the plane of souls, but others have been described, including the domains of the [[Shadowfell]], the [[Nightmare Realm]], and the [[Mirror Realm]].


[7/19/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
I like that. I was playing around with using Shadowfells (plural) rather than Shadowfell, as a way to express the idea of different independent domains better


[7/25/2024 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a rewrite of the history of taelgar (to history-rewrite) branch that restructures age of divinity into four eras:
- growth of humanity from ~1500-2200, when not much happens, basically pre-history
- contact with elder folk from ~2200-2500, when arcane magic + idea of incorporeal gods triggers massive social and cultural change on hkar
- migrations and emigration, from ~2500-3500, starting with the northerner departures and ending with the marniner departures, with at least one (the southerener) migration in between, but possibly more
- arcane hegemony, from ~3500-4122, when the arcane urban culture gets very powerful, mos numena develops, etc; ends with downfall


[7/25/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
logic is basically that contact with elder folk / introduction of arcane magic breaks a long period of status and the social change associated triggers people to start leaving. northerners would be the last of the "small gods" people, after they depart hkar is all pantheonic. mariners are potentially the last (major) non-mos-numena culture, after they leave mos numena gets increaasingly strong and other religious communities (e.g., dunmari?) get increasingly isolated, tend to leave


[7/25/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
the dates are not precise in the doc I pushed and could be shifted


[7/26/2024 9:12 AM] rsulfuratus
working a bit on filling in multiverse / cosmology detail from the riving, and wondering about your feelings about the connection between metaphysics and mechanics. 

for example, at the moment based on the way magic is set up in world, there isn't an obvious way to play a fey cleric. unless you have an unusual backstory where you came to worship a "foreign god"

not sure how i feel about that? 

it particularly impacts the children of the divine, although also potentially also impacts the "unusual species" 

more generally, the basic logic of "divine magic is miracles granted by a god" poses a bit of a challenge for societies that don't seem to innately have gods (centaurs, merfolk, fey, etc) - do they also not have divine magic? and if they don't have divine magic is that a mechanical thing or can they have "clerics" just who generate the same effects from non-divine magic?


[7/26/2024 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea of divine magic = miracles granted by a god and in general feel like it‚Äôs better to not get too focused on D&D mechanics


[7/26/2024 10:07 AM] .deciusmus
But I do think there is a bit of a gap around non-arcane / non-divine magic


[7/26/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
That is, clearly on Taelgar there is:
Arcane casters who channel the plane of magic somehow
Divine casters who specifically get miracles from their gods
‚ÄúOther casters‚Äù = lots of other magical things that are currently somewhat ill defined in the metaphysics


[7/26/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
I think that ‚Äúother‚Äù category is where things like fey clerics and merfolk clerics would fall


[7/26/2024 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm thinking more about two distinct gaps. 

1) Do we care about matching mechanics to lore? That is, cleric/paladin spells in D&D have a certain flavor that is distinct from especially wizard spells. In some cases we've adopted D&D mechanics into lore (e.g., resurrection magic), in other cases not. Is there a reason to think that there are certain kinds of magical effects that are far more straightforward to create by divine magic than other ways? In some sense I think this is already in the lore to a certain extent, e.g. divine miracles tend to be around healing, things like that, but people don't go to a hedge wizard for healing and "Chardonian arcane magical energy" is not really focused around healing, it is things like controlling the wind, minor cantrips for cleaning and light, that kind of thing. Putting aside PC mechanics, is it therefore good or bad to have this play a significant role in worldbuilding, that is should, e.g., fey culture lean heavily away from healing, bless, that type of thing which is coded as "divine magic"? 

(2) Separately, it sometimes feels as if there is something of a gap in the divine order. Is it really the case that *every* society that is not either human or one of the elder folk (including orcs) just doesn't worship gods at all? maybe yes, but I'm not sure I agree


[7/26/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
Re: other magic, I guess I haven't really seen this as a gap? Magic is just applying extraplanar energy to defy typical physics so the source of that extraplanar energy can come from anywhere. 

Fey magic is just manipulating the resonances of the Riving to alter material plane physics using "fey logic". 

Many druids might use resonances of the Elemental Planes, others might use the natural echos of the Riving in the Material Plane itself.


[7/26/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
(More in a bit)


[7/26/2024 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
A few quick thoughts...

(a) I do think that the general "tone" of divine vs arcane magic works, but also I think it doesn't have to be extremely precise or pre-decided. Fey for example seem like they'd lean heavily into enchantments and illusions but I wouldn't worry too much if that crosses the "cleric" vibe boundary (i.e. bless feels like a fey spell, maybe with a different gloss, but healing maybe less so in general). And I think it is good that Chardonian hedge wizards don't know healing spells.

(b) I actually like that gods are a specific thing, not just this idea that every culture has to have a god. I'm not sure that means that no cultures can worship anything at all... isn't the idea of the "arch fey/great wrym/elder elemental/titan"  vibe to set up this alternative power structure that can provide god-like creatures in cultures were it makes sense?


[7/26/2024 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
It may be interesting to explore, what, if anything, is the metaphyiscal difference between the children of the divine vs embodied gods vs children of belief


[7/26/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the part I'm uncertain about is what is, exactly, an archfey? or a great wyrm?


[7/26/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
the lore developing around the early days / mythic history strongly focuses on humanity as the creative force behind "outer planes", with some impact of embodied gods


[7/26/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
but if the "outer planes" are strongly tied to elder folk + humans, where are all the titans of old?


[7/26/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
So one direction is to play into the idea of the "plane of creation / soul stuff" as something that the children of the divine lack access to. The titans are somewhere else, not an outer realm, but somewhere associated with the "lower planes" in your cosmology


[7/26/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
The other direction, I think, is to say that's wrong, and all the children of the divine presence are sorta similar


[7/26/2024 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
right, I think this is the fundamental vibe check I'm looking for


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
and so titans and great wyrms and archfey are really not metaphyically different from embodied gods or human gods


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
metaphyiscally, is there something really very different about the first creations of the divine presence (elder elementals, titans, etc) and the second creations of the divine presence (embodied gods)


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
right exactly


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure the answer


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
the details, I think, don't matter too much, but the vibe makes a big difference. especially on fey lore


[7/26/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
and kiya's questions about ultimately what is different between fey magic and wyrdling magic


[7/26/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
What happens when a fey dies is an interesting question


[7/26/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think it is easier to work out the vibes via thinking about whether there is something different about fey / giants / centaurs / merfolk / etc vs elves / dwarves / orcs / humans


[7/26/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Which I am torn on... on the one hand, one of the things I like about the metaphysics is this idea of the "firstborn" vs "humans" and the metaphysical differences


[7/26/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
On the other hand, I don't love priviledging one group of species as "real people with souls" and therefore implying centaurs / fey etc don't have souls in the same way


[7/26/2024 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
but if centaurs or merfolk are the same as elves, what makes the "elder races" special and distinct?


[7/26/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
from one perspective, it is just because they were created in the age of creation, there is nothing else really distinct about them. just a question of timing, really


[7/26/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure I agree / like that, but it is a possibility


[7/26/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
the firstborn are also the first entities that are called gods at least, and basically invent the concept of "deity"


[7/26/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe the root cause of Cha'mutte's war is that he was angry the so-called Firstborn claimed all the credit for their fancy ideas about "divinity" when really the true children of the divine were there are along. recast it as like a divine sibling war from greek myth


[7/26/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
on a mechanical level, I don't think it works for fey, etc to be "soulless", fwiw. putting aside any lore reasons, we also have for example the canonical fact of agata's soul hiding out in Seeker's ring


[7/26/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
Right, agreed


[7/26/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
Getting in car to drive Z but I‚Äôll ponder more


[7/26/2024 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
So, a few thoughts while I eat lunch...


[7/26/2024 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
a) I think as first principles we should lean towards sticking with the basic idea around "firstborn (+orcs)" vs "humans" vs "hobgoblins" and that, atlhough it doesn't have to be canon that the firstborn are special and different, we should try to make that work before changing it. 

b) I think we are agreed that there is a wide variety of sentient creatures on Taelgar that are neither humans/hobgoblins/firstborn/orcs, but that nevertheless have a soul (in the sense of a essence that is distinct from the material body and that can be ressurected, banished, stolen, trapped, etc


[7/26/2024 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
c) From a vibes perspective, I think there are clear divisions within the sentient creatures between "species" and "magical entities". WIthout necessarily getting into a sidetrack about where do babies come from and so on, there is definitely a different vibe around say fey - who are all a "type" but where hags don't so obviously start life as baby hags vs say dwarves, elves, or kenku, who all clearly have some type of species continuity


[7/26/2024 1:28 PM] rsulfuratus
So, just throwing out some thoughts. Part my impetus for thinking about this is the idea of the ‚Äúbarrier of the land of the dead‚Äù, which sets up a very strong metaphysical distinction between eg demons (who cannot be killed on an ‚Äúinner plane‚Äù, merely banished), and ‚Äúcreatures of the ~inner planes~


[7/26/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
But then you get the problem of what all these other species are?


[7/26/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
And I guess I lean towards they all basically work the same way at a fundamental metaphysical level


[7/26/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Which isn‚Äôt to say the ‚Äúelder folk‚Äù isn‚Äôt a meaningful category


[7/26/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
But, on the other hand, the centaurs are the star of their own story too


[7/26/2024 1:32 PM] rsulfuratus
Which I think is consitdtent with your point (b)


[7/26/2024 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
One stab at a synthesis...

In the Age of Myth, all was changeable, and the flexibility of raw magical energy meant that although an infinite number of things could be created, at the same time nothing was "real". Only the children of the divine, not their creations, had permenance/self/soul, for they had been given soul-stuff by the Divine. These direct children of the divine are rare and powerful, basically they are the same as the embodied gods metaphysically. 

In the moment of the RIving, however, with the creation of the Astral Plane and the the Plane of Creation, the echoes and reverberations allowed this soul stuff to be "caught" by some of the echoes and creations of the Children of the Divine, giving them permeance and self, and power, in some sense proportional to the luck/skill/whatever that allowed one fey bundle of magic to catch much more of the essence of creation than another


[7/26/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
... I'm not totally sure where I am going with this


[7/26/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
But I guess the thought was to set up a distinction between

(a) fey and elementals, in particular, who are more creations of the echo realms, in some way, than creations of any particular god
(b) set up fey in particular as having a gradient of power. Some arch fey are much more powerful than others, and I wonder if any of the original, god-like children of the divine archfey really still exist?


[7/26/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is fine as far as it goes


[7/26/2024 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I‚Äôm more thinking about though, from a basic ‚Äúsoul‚Äù point of view, what‚Äôs the line? 

In current lore, you have humans/elder folk with clear metaphysics, and everything else very vague. 

I‚Äôm leaning toward something that is more: any sentient, self-aware being on Taelgar is, in some way, partially made of ~soul stuff~


[7/26/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
The details can be blurry and variable for different species, of course


[7/26/2024 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
The one plausible exception might Far Realm aberrations


[7/26/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
I also think there is potentially a reasonable way to make a metaphysical distinction between some different types of creatures, specifically:

(a) the echo/inner realm inhabitants - in particular fey and elementals, but maybe some others as well, who clearly have souls but also, I am pretty sure, don't have "creator gods" and also have (I think) wide variants in power between different ones of the same "type"

(b) the demons/devils/angels/etc - outer plane inhabitants - who are, in some sense, "native soul stuff", and are much more directly tied to the energy of creation and the barrier of the land of the dead and so on

(c) far realms creatures, who I think definitely don't have Taelgarian souls at all, and are odd and unique and come from "elsewhere"

(d) the elder folk (+ orcs), whose soul stuff was distinctly, uniquely, and specifically shaped by their firstborn (+ maybe the kenku, pending Aerin's specifics)

(e) humans, whose soul stuff is explicitly shaped/given by the Divine Presence and has the Divine Spark

(f) the unique creatures: centaurs merfolk kobolds giants at least, maybe others. But what distinguishes unique creatures from elder folk + humans is that, for whatever reason, their soul stuff did not come from a god or other specific "divine" entity


[7/26/2024 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
What really distinguishes (d) from (f) is not metaphysics but origin. The creaturs in (d) are a unique category because they have gods who shape their soul stuff into their species. The creatures in (f) do not have gods, or at least, if they worship something, it isn't their creator


[7/26/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think all makes sense. Although for example merfolk might very workshop the sentient ocean, who is their creature but not a god (in the sense of being a being of ‚Äúcreative energy‚Äù)


[7/26/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
*worship


[7/26/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
So metaphysically, devils are functionally gods, just very weak ones


[7/26/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
As being of ‚Äúpure soul stuff‚Äù


[7/26/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
Right in the case of the merfolk the metaphysics are probably very different than say dwarves. The sentient ocean as a Far Realm being has no access to "taelgar soul stuff" in the way an embodied god would, and whatever magic was used to create/awaken/etc the merfolk they got their souls in some different way than being given them by the sentient ocean


[7/26/2024 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. Although the same is true of ghosts and dead humans, right?


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Hmm. I‚Äôm not sure why the sentient ocean couldn‚Äôt have access to ~soul stuff~. I think what I‚Äôm arguing for is thinking of -soul stuff- as essentially another force like magic


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
But obviously a lot harder to use


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess being made of soul stuff and being able to access it for magic are two different things


[7/26/2024 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
so, to summarize, I think the logic is:

(1) major divisions of living or sort-of-living things in Taelgar:

(a) Sentient, self-aware creatures that are native to the "inner realms" (echo realms + energy realms + anything else that might be invented that is "protected" from the raw power of the Plane of Creation by the Land of the Dead), are sentient and self-aware because they are animated by a fragment of ~soulstuff~. When they die, this fragment typically travels to the Land of the Dead, and eventually passes beyond into the "Outer Realms". 

(b) Sentient, self-aware creatures native to the "outer realms" (spiritual realms + astral plane + anything on the "Plane of Creation" side of the Land of the Dead) are pure beings of soulstuff, manifest into physical form. When killed in the "inner realms", they return to their native plane, possibly changed. They can only be fully destroyed when beyond the Land of the Dead. 

(c) Some creatures (many constructs, some undead, simlacrums, perhaps some elementals, etc) are sentient and self-aware but only by using the raw energy of the Plane of Magic in imitation of "soulstuff". These creatures simply cease to exist if destroyed, wherever they are.


[7/26/2024 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(d) Creatures from the Far Realms, where different rules apply.


[7/26/2024 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(e) Beasts or other kinds of non-self-aware, non-sentient creatures are just creatures


[7/26/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, most of the "interesting" distinctions are within (a), and this has a lot to do with origin stories and how each individual species / creature gained access to "soulstuff".


[7/26/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
This all fits pretty well with the Creating New Species document, although I think the distinctions in (a) probably don't map well onto that document


[7/26/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the big vibe shift is kind of opening things up to diverse ways that various non-divine entities might have had access to "soul stuff magic" to create things


[7/26/2024 2:11 PM] .deciusmus
I would also add that I think it is worth establishing that within (a) there is basically 3 categories:

(a) humans, who were given Divine-Spark-enabled soul stuff directly from the Divine Presence
(b) the "created" races (elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk, stoneborn, orcs, and maybe kenku) who are distinguished via the story of a creator god who specifically shaped them
(c) other (everyone else) whose only real distinguishing trait should be that they are not (b)


[7/26/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I'm not sure how that plays out exactly, but I still think it is important to preserve something unique about the "firstborn" races


[7/26/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
That is, I guess I mean, I still think it is worth thinking about how (b) is different from (c) in a way that provides a canonical reason why centaurs and merfolk were not targeted by Cha'mutte


[7/26/2024 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I would say that the clear metaphyiscal uniqueness there is actually in the nature of the embodied gods


[7/26/2024 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
that is, you have say four (currently) types of beings that are "made of soulstuff"


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
(a) the children of the divine
(b) the embodied gods
(c) the incorporeal gods and everything related to them (which would, in this case, stretch to natives of "outer planes")
(d) the divine presence themselves


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
the unique think about the firstborn is they are the only sentient species created by (b)


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right so the idea would be that actually you have a distinction like

(a) humans, created by Divine Presence
(b) firstborn, created by the Embodied Gods, who are a specific group with unique commonalities 
(c) others, created by something or someone else, who is definitely not an Embodied God, because the embodied gods are specific group of entities


[7/26/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[7/26/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually think this implies perhaps a bit of revision of the void mind and the three despairs, to make Thark unique as the only embodied god among the Void Mind creations

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/26/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
which is in practice how things have played out in game, with Thark clearly distinct from e.g. Jinnik


[7/26/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
It also suggests that the earlier statement - that there is nothing special about the embodied gods - is probably wrong


[7/26/2024 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there is nothing special in the sense that they, like the children of the divine and the incorporeal gods, are "powerful beings made of the energy of creation"

but, metaphysically, there is something unique about the way they are created that is distinct from the way the children of the divine or the incorporeal gods are created


[7/26/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
the original idea is that they are physically embodied in a way the incorporeal gods are not, and so are not tied to belief in the same way. so there are differences


[7/26/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
Radical thought: should titans elder elementals arch fey great worms actually still exist?


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
what, like Cha'mutte was the last of his kind?


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
What if, for the most part, they were somehow consumed/destroyed/turned into echos during the Riving


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
although that raises questions. like, what is Gazankoa if not an elder elemental?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
or the various archfey?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
or, i guess, maybe the point is there were once *even more powerful* versions of these that disappeared?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that was the idea


[7/26/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
The archfey are just really powerful fey now. None of the existing arch fey were actually alive in any meaningful sense before the riving


[7/26/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure that is an important detail to decide on at the moment, but worth keeping in mind


[7/26/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I guess its more a vibe-thing: I don't think we should necessarily think of Ethlenn and Gazankoa and Cha'mutte as necessarily "siblings" or "part of the same creation"


[7/26/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
or even "the same type of thing" in the way that Elmerca and the Bahazeal are "the same type of thing"


[7/26/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, from a vibes perspective I think that makes sense, but also there could have been a lot of diversity pre-Riving. and how would you even remember stuff if linear casuality doesn't work? it is possible that entities that survived the riving emerged deeply changed


[7/26/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a meeting at 2:30 but am going to try to edit the creating new species doc and clean up a few lingering history of taelgar edits and then make PR to merge the history-rewrite branch later this afternoon or tonight

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/26/2024 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
I left a few notes about the species stuff... but go ahead and merge I liked all the timeline stuff


[7/26/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm slightly editing the species doc. my intention is not to suggest there are lots of additional species that are associated with dragons/fey/elementals/giants, but rather that giants, dragons (+kobolds), fey (many different species), and elementals (many different species) are their own thing separate from the more general "awakened/cursed/other" category


[7/26/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
are they necessarily though?


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
in practice I don't think it matters


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe not really


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm questioning whether, i.e. Titans should necessarily be considered canonical


[7/26/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
or whether it means anything to say "Dragons were [something] by great wyrms"


[7/26/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
I think that is maybe under considered and if we ever decided to make up the history of dragons and what they are precisely, the existence or not of great wryrms in the age of myth isn't super relevant


[7/26/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
same deal with giants; whether titans are a real thing or not I'm not sure it is meaning to say that giants are in some sense an "echo" of titans.


[7/26/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
This is more relevant to me in terms of the fey where I'm not at all convinced that the story is "archfey created fey" but maybe something more like "some type of essence that has been conceptualized as fey by the current fey existed before time and its transformation during the Riving created many different fey creatures, of widely varying power levels"


[7/26/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i am fairly attached to the idea that giants and dragons are somehow larger than life and have this history of being vastly more powerful, with echoes of that power (e.g., phasing stones, flying castles) lingering


[7/26/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the fey and elementals are distinct and in some ways more complicated and so perhaps not too helpful to lump all four groups together


[7/26/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Again, not sure it matters in the species doc; I'm really just arguing that sentient species - including fey/giants/elementals - should have some kind of unique creation story and/or a canonically blank space filled only with vibes


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'd rather say:

Giants and dragons are, in some sense, echoes or descendants or creations of the beings of pure magical energy that existed before the Riving


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
and than describe your vibe thing above


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right

I actually think it solves some problems to just say the time before the Riving was in some sense unknowable and is vibes based only and be judicious about which existing structures on Taelgar echo back to a pre-Riving time.

Clearly giants, dragons, fey, and elementals do (although for different reasons) but I'm not sure it would be a problem if a fifth category came along that should also echo back to ancient days. But that doesn't necessarily imply the existing of some specific set of entities created by the Divine Presence


[7/26/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking about what is actually in game and not world building, I think:
- the vibe I described about giants and dragons is important, and also for giants some kind of history/echo of much stronger magic in the past that is connected to rune magic and the dwarven firstborn and such (leading to myths -- maybe true, maybe not -- that the Runecrafter learned magic from ~someone/something~ during the Riving)
- the fey are diverse and despite having different forms and power have a shared history, so it doesn't necessarily make sense to have a separate "origin story" for satyrs vs pixies, for example. the fey, writ large, have a kind of collective origin of some kind, dating to the riving
- elementals are similar, albeit someone more hierarchical and ordered, and much more commonly soullles magical creations (most standard "water elementals" or whatever are this) than fey are, and they are orgainzed around rulers of each domain (e.g., marid, djinni, efreeti, dao), who in tern owe allegiance to some kind of "elemental powers" of which gazankoa is the only named example


[7/26/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes that dynamic (unknowable, vibes based) probably makes sense


[7/26/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
for pre-riving "history"


[7/26/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I agree about all of that, but I actually think it is more important to, i.e. state that the fey, as a "type of creature" have a shared origin that dates to the Riving than to try to say that "archfey" existing before the riving and fey are somehow related.

and I also think that "echoes of the Riving" is a potentially more flexible category than just fey/elementals/dragons/giants but also doesn't necessarily include say kobolds and trolls even though kobolds are dragon-ish and trolls are giant-ish


[7/26/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I think I might modify the inner plane native to separate out "echoes of the riving" (fey, elementals, dragons, giants at the moment), from "other" and then merge "corrupted, awakened, unusual" into "other" which is just everything else


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense to me


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
although actually corrupted I thought was a decent category on its own


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, right, good to keep that as well


[7/26/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
Mentally, it feels to me like the areas I'd be comfortable just randomly introducing something in game without some kind of pre-dicsussion (YMMV might be reasonably different than mine) would be 
(a) corrupted
(b) types of fey or elementals
(c) beasts
(d) magical creations
(e) children of creation
(f) abberations

But things that didn't fit in those categories I'd probably want a better story and compelling reason


[7/26/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Which is were in particular, I find the species guide useful. To define the types of things that are "common" vs "rare", in some sense


[7/26/2024 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is reasonable. i pushed an update that I think is clearer. will slightly tweak age of myth text, and then merge, later tonight

[8/4/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
any thoughts about true names and the magic of names esp amongst the fey in taelgar?


[8/4/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
Not really a thing? Myth/culture but not very powerful? Some type of actual magic?


[8/12/2024 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i added images for the rest of Delwath's items, curious what you think/if there are any that don't work for you


[8/12/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
also not sure how I missed the question about true names / magic of names. don't really have thoughts other than kind of wanting to avoid layering too many things together. might make sense for dragons and/or fey? certainly seems kind of fey-ish to have names mean something...but no real strong feelings any way at the moment


[8/12/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
I like the Delwath items. The rod of the pact keeper is creepy but that seems reasonable given its origin


[8/12/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
On names, here is what I ended up telling my players...

That said, to expand on the "aliases and names thing"....

The actual biggest danger is not even the "alias/call me by" that Kiya is talking about, it is the innocent  but misleading question, i.e.

"Can I have your name?"

A trickster fey could certainly have magic about them that would mean answering that question with "Sure, my name is Robin" could be bad. Now the fey "has" your name - maybe that makes it easy for them to impersonate you - maybe it means all of a sudden you forget your name - etc.

But the trouble was not catching the precise wording.

Answering a question with "Call me by..." rather than "my name is" is a safety measure - if someone says

"Can I have your name" and you answer "Call me Robin" you haven't given away your name.
Secondarily, the point Kiya was making is also true. There is a degree to which certain curses, rituals, etc depend on knowledge about the person, and certainty is better than doubt.


[8/12/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
So announcing to a fey "I am Robin of Abenfyrd, born in 1699, member of the order of the chartiable wanderer, acting guard captain of Cleenseau" gives them more true things about you. Which can make certain types of magic easier.

Saying instead: "Call me Robin, lately from Abenfyrd, wanderer and defender of the lands north of the Enst" is a lot vaguer, and thus less powerful.

But also a lot of Sembarans would call some of this Tyrwinghan superstitution. The true nature of fey magic is mysterious and exactly what powers it none of you know

To add, as far as you know there is no "true name" magic. That is, it isn't like if someone knows your name is Robin or Celyn or whatever, they have a voodoo-doll power over you and somehow you have to hide your name. 

It is better to think of it as more along the lines of - the less well your fey adversary knows you, and the more obstacles or secondary interpretations you put in your words, the better.


[8/12/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
[ in my head, I was basically thinking I didn't want to introduce yet another type of magic, although if dragons or something ends up having the concept, fine, there is a lot of "as far as you knows" in the above. But I think fey have enough going on without introducing the idea of True Names or whatever. And that the vibe of "hiding who you are" is better than something about the specific name ]


[8/12/2024 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah this all makes sense to me from a fey angle. possibly dragons have some secret "magic language" where names matter more or something (a callback to 'true magic' from high school) but that is for later and I agree the fey vibe is more about knowledge of who you are then any specific words


[8/15/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
Do you know what happened to Cloudspinner and are keeping it secret for game/plot reasons or do you just not know?


[8/15/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
I'm potentially setting up my PCs to care a bit about her fate. Not that it will come up soon or anything but they might at some point want to do something like go haring off to try to save her.

(Given that I'm setting up Greymalkin as a refugee from Amberglow, and that they are all the kind of people who hear the words "good fey mysteriously imprisoned" and immediately think  "um, maybe we should free her")

I guess canonically they can't possibly free her because she isn't free in 1748.


[8/15/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes I know exactly what happened to her and can't tell you (yet)


[8/15/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
But you will almost certainly have more information before it becomes relevant in your game


[8/15/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Note that probably all Greymalkin would know is that Cloudspinner mysteriously vanished


[8/15/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the only way you learned she was imprisoned was the meta-narrative in the intro to the Amberglow / Caulaus session


[8/15/2024 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
right, that makes sense


[8/15/2024 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
how's this

"Seven hundred years ago, to the south, the Cloudspinner, Queen of Sunsets ruled the fey realm of Amberglow. How I wish I had seen it in those days. It is said to have been a land where the glorious colors of the evening sun turned the sky and the grass and the water and the rocks to ever-changing paintings." He stops and shrugs in a way that points at his bright coloring. "It was a place aflame with color and joy, I am told."

"But she vanished - to where, no one knows - and the land decayed. The colors seeped out of it, and darkness and danger moved in. But not all was lost, for in pockets and hidden crannies, those loyal to the Cloudspinner kept hope alive. I was born in one of those pockets, ~name tbd~, in the days before the Great War, about 200 years ago."


[8/15/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
haven't written more yet but the basic narrative is that about 100 years ago, this pocket of safety fell to Umbraeth


[8/15/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's about right, timing might be slightly off, the exact date of cloudspinners disapperance is sometime after 950 - when the orcs of the people of the rainbow started to leave amberglow and before 1059 - fall of drankor


[8/15/2024 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a random bit that I just made up without context about the resistance to the decay in the cloudspinner page you can steal from if you want


[8/15/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I was looking at that

not sure if you are still on Nantucket with your friends, but FWIW Nathaniel has been asking for a while to start a new family D&D campaign which we are finally doing soon, and I'm reviving Addermarch as the setting. Will probably be pushing some significant cleanup / updates over the next couple of days. when you have free time might be useful to chat a bit about relationships between Addermarch and Tyrwingha but no rush


[9/1/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
Still on Nantucket but happy to text about addermarch a bit. Only have my phone but‚Ä¶


[9/1/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
I have a few people from addermarch but haven‚Äôt developed it much. Figured it was somewhat more influenced by Tyrwingha than other places and the Darkwood is connected to Duskmire in some way


[9/1/2024 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
basically trying to work out a rough history. my recollection from the Duskmire history is that the Darkwood goes way back. there is a note suggesting that Umbraeth was exiled in the DR 600s, but not sure if that is strictly canonical


[9/1/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
but assuming that Darkwood is a dangerous place during the Drankorian expansion (timing is not perfect, but relatively close), Addermarch is probably a pretty marginal backwater during the Drankorian era


[9/1/2024 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm imagining the geography/climate as kind of mid-Atlantic Applachians. Addermarch itself is pretty hilly with difficult overland travel, except along the (few) navigable rivers / river valleys


[9/1/2024 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
so my basic history is that:
- pre-Drankor, Addermarch is settled by Tyrwinghans, but is always fairly marginal
- Drankor, it is a province of Drankor, but not a particularly important one. but crucially outside the deal with Ethlenn so more directly assimilated


[9/1/2024 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
have some forestry, and the Aure is navigable as far as Addermarch, so not a total economic dead zone. but not rich by any means.


[9/1/2024 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
in the Timeline of Sembaran history, Addermarch is noted to be established as the Earldom of Adderfell (presumably being called an Earldom due to cultural and historical connections to Tyrwingha) in lands formerly controlled by Avatus


[9/1/2024 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
here it seems like there are two possibilities, based on the geography that has Addermarch as kind of a pocket surrounded by hills on three sides (west, south, east):
- one option would be that this was an area that suffered from hobgoblin and other raids for a long time after the major defeats of Avataus, basically a backwater where many of the hobgoblins, etc, in Avatus army fled
- a different option would be actually this was never conquered, but was cut of from Sembara by Avatus, and so during the post plague years it was really functionally a part of Tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
in either case, it becomes part of the Sembaran crown during Derik I's rule, after the defeat of Avatus


[9/1/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm not convinced that Atavus stuff has to be canonical


[9/1/2024 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôve imagined the western and northern borders of addermarch to be pretty rough terrain


[9/1/2024 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
So it seems plausible it was never conquered and has an older history


[9/1/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, basic idea is that the western edge of the mostreve hills is a very rough, with a steep escarpment particularly on the west that borders the Gap of Maseau


[9/1/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
less rough to the northeast where the Aure flows towards the Enst, of course, and less rough towards Tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
The Tyrwinghan part of the mostreve hills I‚Äôve established as much denser in fey than elsewhere and not very settled but where settled very traditional


[9/1/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense


[9/1/2024 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
potentially Ethlenn's domain might extend southeast towards Orenlas, putting the Tyrwinghan Mostreve hills at the center


[9/1/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah maybe


[9/1/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think the settlement of addermarch was probably originally a bit complex - tyrwinghans but also clearly leaving Ethelenns domain


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right. it has many cultural similarities to Tyrwingha but doesn't have the same fey connection which has a big impact


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
potentially in part settled by Tyrwinghans who *didn't* want to be part of Ethlenn's bargain


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
It might have originally been something of a frontier perhaps even a place of exile / banishment from Tyrwingha. Somewhat dangerous and with fey in the Darkwood on the southern border


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
Right the rejection of the bargain could work as well


[9/1/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
post-Drankor, my image of the vibe is kind of like the Dendarii Mountains in the Miles books, although without the implication of technological backwardness and the kind of dumb hill people stereotypes


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but a rough place that was the center of guerilla fighting during several post-Drankor, pre-Great War wars (e.g., Avatus), but never conquered and proud of it


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
then, the same thing repeats during the hobgoblin wars. it is never conquered, but especially during the 3rd hobgoblin war it is completely isolated from Sembara


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I like that


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/1/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly there isn‚Äôt really any reason it ever has to have been part of sembara


[9/1/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
It might work better if it was simply always an independent frontier type place


[9/1/2024 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's true


[9/1/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
A backwater Drankorian province in the hills that was mostly known for the Darkwood in the south


[9/1/2024 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
Avatus never conquerors it but probes and maybe does some damage/marches through


[9/1/2024 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
But during the Avatus-Great War period is closely aligned with sembara and there are lots of back and forth


[9/1/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Then during the more recent hobgoblin wars it becomes more isolated again


[9/1/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think that makes sense. it might have a similar history to e.g. Vostok, in that during the height of the power of the Deriks the earl of adderfell swears personal fealty to Derik (as an underking type thing)


[9/1/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but then post Great War it quickly departs the Sembaran orbit


[9/1/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
And in the last 150 years has developed kinda independently with a bit of a ‚Äúthese are our hills ‚Äú vibe


[9/1/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, especially until the final defeat of the hobgoblins in the 1650s it was repeatedly isolated from Sembara. and then even again e.g. during the undead crisis in your current campaign it would be the natural response of the people of Addermarch to retreat to the hills


[9/1/2024 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Adderfellians? Adderfelsh? hard to come up with a demonym

A demonym (; from Ancient Greek  Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøœÇ (d√™mos) 'people, tribe' and  ·ΩÑŒΩœÖŒºŒ± (√≥numa) 'name') or gentilic (from Latin  gentilis 'of a clan, or gens') is a word that identifies a group of people (inhabitants, residents, natives) in relation to a particular place. Demonyms are usually derived from the name of the place (hamlet, village, town, city, re...

anyway I think this basic history is logical, I'll probably push some updates tonight


[9/1/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
When are you setting this family game? 1740s?


[9/1/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
probaby, haven't decided


[9/1/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking also about titles and governance a bit, I'm leaning towards Addermarch retaining a system similar to Tyrwingha but without the fey influence. pre-Drankor, both Tyrwingha and Addermarch centralize power largely in the hands of the earls, a group of knights-errants basically, who answer to Ethlenn in Tyrwingha but perhaps to no central authority in Addermarch, or perhaps the earls elect one of their own to be overking.

during Drankorian rule, the earls are coopted by the Drankorian state in both places with a governor ruling, but in Addermarch -- which has a much more violent post-Drankor history -- you basically revert back to earls electing an overking after Drankor falls


[9/1/2024 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so it has a lot of cultural parallels with Tyrwingha but more of a rugged independent vibe and without the fey influence


[9/1/2024 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
on a related topic, do you have any names for political subunits of Tyrwingha? wondering if this should be English (e.g., shires) or more French, perhaps county


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm not sure there are political subunits


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think earls have circuits


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
But not fixed domains per se


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
but there are no layers between earls and individual manors?


[9/1/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
I don‚Äôt think so. Tyrwingha is physically fairly small


[9/1/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
Celyns village, which Kiya developed in a fair bit of detail, doesn‚Äôt have a lord of any sort except the earl


[9/1/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
It was left a little unclear whether sembara introduced the idea of manorial feudalism


[9/1/2024 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right. i guess addermarch doesn't have to follow precisely but perhaps there isn't much benefit to introducing another layer


[9/1/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
Or more specifically my view was something like‚Ä¶.

In traditional Tyrwingha there were earls who rode circuits and collected labor tithes from those on their circuits (and the earl and their household would basically live off the people and villages in their circuit)


[9/1/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
In northern Tyrwingha sembaran manorial feudalism starting to spread from sembara


[9/1/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
But I left it undeveloped how far jt had spread


[9/1/2024 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
One of the ideas is that in Tyrwingha the fey protect the people from the mysterious scary threats


[9/1/2024 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that makes sense


[9/1/2024 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
Whereas in sembara that‚Äôs the job of the manorial lord


[9/1/2024 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
addermarch has a lot of castles and forts that need to be supported


[9/1/2024 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
So there are less taxes and formal hierarchy in Tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
Addermarch on the other hand might have formalized a group of effectively castellans beneath the earls who control the defenses


[9/1/2024 8:58 PM] rsulfuratus
but i was imagining something that wasn't directly manorial feudalism, more like you have shires or counties or whatever that have a count or a baron or whatever, and then need to support defense via castles but the castles are generally occupied by a knight or a castellan who does not have any herditary claim on the land


[9/1/2024 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe you can cut out the count/baron whatever and just have the knights/castellans as vassals of the earls


[9/1/2024 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I‚Äôd do that. Addermarch is small. I think it‚Äôs smaller than Ireland for example


[9/1/2024 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
it is about 23,000 square miles, ireland is about 25,000


[9/1/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
It‚Äôs also a place that could be a bit random/not neat. Maybe there‚Äôs an uneven divide amongst the earls and the earl of the southern border has a couple of vassals between them and the knights


[9/1/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
Not necessarily of course but if it makes sense for a story/histody


[9/1/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
But I don‚Äôt think there should be a formalized subdivision like sembaran baronies

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/1/2024 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah there are also some not neat things like the lord of adderfell is considered an earl despite not riding a circuit and functioning basically like a manorial lord

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/1/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Another thing to think about is the fey influence isn‚Äôt empty on addermarch - the southern part is part of the fey ‚Äúbelt‚Äù right? But these are duskmire fey or perhaps other domains not so safe/under control as Tyrwinghan fey.


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
So I kinda think addermarch should have more of a fey influence then say sembara ‚Ä¶ but in a more ‚Äúthey are dangerous‚Äù way


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
originally the idea was duskmire started in the region of the feywild colocated with darkwood


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
(and is the source of the "Darkwood" name)


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah

I guess addermarch itself is under less clear fey influence


[9/1/2024 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
well, it is definitely a place where people worry about the fey

except probably the the far eastern part of addermarch along the tyrwinghan border, which is relatively far from the darkwood and very close to ethlenn. possibly colocated with sunset gate

Addermarch is roughly divided into four major geographic regions:
- To the west and northwest, the Maseau Escarpment is a region of rough hills and some mountains that borders the flat plains of the Maseau Gap. This is a hard land with few people. This area was extensively fortified at multiple times in the past, but the castles in the hills have not all been maintained and many are now in ruins. %% very mountainous, steep cliffs, maybe Provence-like? white mountains %%
- The center of the realm is the Aure river valley, a land of rolling hills, forests, and many rivers that cut through the hills. This region is the most densely settled, and includes Adderfell, the only real city in Addermarch. This is also the major agricultural land in Addermarch, and the center of brandy production. The Aure is navigable from Adderfell to the Enst, and many riverboats ply their trade along it. %% Shenandoah/Blue Hills, Susquehana river valley%%
- To the south and east of the Aure valley are several lines of wooded hills and mountains, rising gradually to the height of land on the eaves of the Darkwood. This region is well-guarded, and lightly populated, mostly with smallholds of foresters and furriers. %% also mid-Atlantic Appalachians but very wooded%%
- To the east and northeast, along the borders of Tyrwingha, the poor soil of the hilly, rocky land keeps forests to sheltered valleys. This is largely rangeland: sheep and cattle graze in the high pastures in summer, and only in a few sheltered valleys do crops survive. %% more open meadows, less forests, perhaps also a bit Provence-ish? %%


[9/1/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
What about the northern hills?


[9/1/2024 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
that is part of the Maseau Escarpment


[9/1/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôd see the hills to the east more like the hills to the south


[9/1/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
I think the Tyrwinghan / adderfell border is thicker forested hills than what you have above?


[9/1/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I need to draw it out on a map and play a bit with it. i think I'm imagining that there are some higher mountains

not the border that runs north/south


[9/1/2024 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
Although maybe the forested slopes on the northern/eastern side give way to worse soil and rocky land on the west/south slopes


[9/1/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing I‚Äôve established is that the hills to the far east are pretty forested


[9/1/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
Also that the land between the mostreve hills and the enst is rocky with steep hills and forested valleys, but hard to navigate as it rises to the Appalachian-like peaks between adderfell  and the borderlands. Basically you wouldn‚Äôt go that way if you could help it versus down the Aure

basically like a big "C" with the lower curve truncated on the west end of the mostreve hills


[9/1/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
on the very western edge it is very steep and drops to a flat(ish) plain at the "Gap of Maseau" but the north is broader and probably more mountains and less dramatic cliffs rising from a plain

[9/2/2024 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
Pro susbscription


[9/2/2024 11:45 AM] .deciusmus

ah yeah looking at now, free is pretty minimal


[9/2/2024 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
btw at some point I'm thinking of making a vector-based world hex map to be a slightly better organized version of the "canonical map", probably using the Adventurer Conqueror King system (smallest unit is the 6 mile hex, which aggregate to 24 mile hexes), but then I'd likely add a rough 85 x 85 mile square (1 degree latitude) and a 425 mile square. so on the large map you'd have a 20x20 grid as the biggest aggregation, with each grid cell representing 5 degrees latitude, and breaking down into 25 smaller squares, with each smaller square containing ~12 big hexes


[9/2/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
main question is what to make it in


[9/2/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
would not be designed to be player facing so doesn't have to look good


[9/2/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but ideally would be editable by both of us


[9/2/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
and would be done with vectors so zoomable


[9/2/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus

Two unrelated questions:
(2) how would elves think about war dead? would their be memorials? graves? seems like they would be treated differently than elves who leave when they want


[9/2/2024 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
Surprisngly, trying to work out answers as part of Colorado session prep


[9/2/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
On elven war dead, I think there would be some sense of lose, like they were artificially cut off from Adanor


[9/2/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
So a memorial might celebrate that connection and therefore be living?


[9/2/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah like the idea of something living. mostly want to check that it wouldn't seem weird for their to be elven memorials to the war dead, in the same sense it would be weird to have elven graveyards.


[9/2/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
The first thought that comes to mind is something like an elaborate and enormous flowering tree. I think the vibe would very much be about memorializing the connection to Aldanor. Perhaps even something spontaneous- like the elven forest expressing its own loss of these elves who were still entangled with the mortal world


[9/2/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm not sure elves would build memorials so much as tend to them


[9/2/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
One thought on addermarch - the history of 1720-1740 might be a bit hard to work out esp as it relates to Duskmire and the fey. I‚Äôm not sure if you are planning much fey involvement in the family campaign though


[9/2/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
Nathaniel wants to be a warlock with an archfey patron


[9/2/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but i doubt that requires lots of details


[9/2/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. doesn't really matter if something dramatic happens to Umbreath in your campaign


[9/2/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
as long as like the Darkwood is not cleansed of all darkness or something


[9/2/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case i want him to be free to be silly and creative so not planning on trying to connect his fey patron to more established lore, particularly


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right, makes sense. There are a bunch of spaces for random minor fey lords along the sunset gate


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
That are broadly ‚Äúgood‚Äù and aligned with Ethlenn


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i was either going to do that, or someone from the talking animals realm


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
since I think nathaniel would like a talking animals fey patron


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, sure.


[9/2/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
which could also be along sunset gate, just further north, so would make more sense if he wants to be from somewhere "far away"


[9/2/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah it could also be to the west a bit, north of duskmire and overlapping zimkova

not sure if you are interested in this, but with the new D&D rules now available I've been thinking a bit about updating the set of playable species in Taelgar, both to bring homebrew species up to the new design and to have a bit more principled set of playable species (motivated by the new family campaign I'm starting and Isaac's friends wanting to make new Taelgar characters for the semi-defunct Great Library campaign). 

thinking a little bit about it, my feelings are that there are really potentially four groups of species.

1. standard species are species that are widespread, deeply integrated into worldbuilding, and straightforwardly available as PC options (but they don't have to be common, e.g. elves). I'd consider these to be: human, elf, dwarf, lizardfolk, halfling, stoneborn, kenku, centaur at the moment but could move other species here possibly.

2. fey species are the large class of feywild natives that often find themselves on the material plane and would usually be viable PC options. These would include: satyr, "fae/fey" (which needs a little thought as to the generic "fey humanoid" species stat block), fairy (pixie/sprite), changelings, some kind of "beastfolk" options (e.g. haregon, owlin, tabaxi type species, but requires a bit of thought)

3. "unusual" species are species with well-established lore and integrated into worldbuilding but that have complications that prevent them from being a straightforward PC option. orc, hobgoblin, goblin, bugbear, kobold, merfolk, gnome are the most obvious ones here. maybe shifter to represent lycanthropes.

4. "rare" species are things that might be viable player options but are not integrated into worldbuilding. mostly things like the various "plane-touched" humans (aasimar, tiefling, genasi), or the dhampir/hexblood/reborn Ravenloft lineages, or the "underdark" species variants. maybe warforged


[9/4/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
my main interests at the moment are:
(1) solidify the set of standard species and homebrew new versions of them
(2) solidify the set of fey species but typically use published versions for them
(3) make some decisions about what rare/unusual species would not disrupt the Taelgar vibe to include


[9/4/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., Nathaniel originally wanted to play an orc, which I decided was too complicated for the game I want to run, but in principle I could see an orc PC as being kind of an interesting option in the right campaign


[9/4/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
but, again, not sure if you care too much


[9/4/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not massively interested in thinking about additional homebrew rules as my game probably has 2-3 years still to go and I have no plans to run anything small scale in Taelgar (i.e. if my game for Zachary's friends restarts, it would not be in Taelgar)


[9/4/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
My main interest would be impact on worldbuilding


[9/4/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
to the extent that there is any...


[9/4/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
My instinct in games I run is to wait to homebrew stuff until people want it, but I can see how that doesn't work as well for your kids/their friends


[9/4/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah it is particularly a challenge for Isaac's friends because they tend to be a lot more build-oriented than anyone else I run games for


[9/4/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
so they always want to see the traits/features before they decide what to do


[9/4/2024 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
In general, I think there is a benefit to "less is more" in this space though. D&D has way too many playable species


[9/4/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
even if they just rebuild their existing characters I need dwarf, lizardfolk, (some kind of fey) for them, plus halfling, elf, human for my family game, so that is nearly all the most common options anyway (except for stoneborn which no one ever seems to want to play)


[9/4/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i feel like there is a fair bit of tension between worldbuilding and what a lot of the people I run games for want here, so i'm trying to balance


[9/4/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
from a worldbuilding perspective adding more species gets to be quite annoying, so the humans + elder folk is a great setup


[9/4/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
and having diverse fey options seems like a good compromise to expand the playable species quite a bit with minimal worldbuilding impact


[9/4/2024 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
Yes, that makes a lot of sense to me


[9/4/2024 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
In particular, having a wide variety of fey species doesn't actually commit any of them to be "real species" with lore and stuff. There's no need for a defined community of taxabi to have a half-cat fey


[9/4/2024 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
right, exactly. it is the obvious solution to any kind of "beastfolk" build


[9/4/2024 10:35 AM] rsulfuratus
the big things I'm not sure about that could impact worldbuliding are:
(1) kobolds have always occupied a bit of weird place. i've used them a fair bit (mostly in the Great Library) campaign and they don't really work as a "typical evil" race (orcs, goblinoids). generally they've been regarded as a nuisance and sometimes a threat by humans nearby, but there is certainly room to expand kobold lore. adding kobolds to centaurs and kenku as "playable weird species not from the feywild" would give 9 species + fey options that feels pretty complete. 
(2) there are a large number of D&D species that are basically plane-touched humans. i don't want these to have big communities and have lots of lore, but i'm not sure whether or not it would matter to allow e.g.  one-off aasimars with unique backstories that are fundamentally "human".


[9/4/2024 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a place for kobolds as an interesting "other" species (to go along with kenku, merfolk, and centaurs in particular) and a "nuisance" but not "creation of the void mind" species seems like it could fill a niche


[9/4/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
As to (2), I think sensible having some one-off stuff (which, actually, kinda fits in the lore via a "magical soul", especially for tielflings or aasimar


[9/4/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
(and probably Gensasi as well)


[9/4/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
if it were me I don't think I'd let anything outside of assimar/gensai/tieflings in though


[9/4/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
for "plane touched" humans


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
Potential updated elf. Goal is to streamline a little bit (no need to repeat spell descriptions in the traits) and balance against PHB 2024 Elf. Could potentially use a couple more ritual choices, and the 5th level improvements for Elven Ritual Magic are maybe not strong/interesting enough.


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
### Elves

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: Your size is Medium.
**Speed**: 30 feet
**Age**: Elves do not die of old age, but during each cycle of the ka, the pull of the material world weakens for them. Few elves remain on Taelgar beyond their fifth ka (approximately 800 years).
**Languages**: Elves long lifespan means they typically learn more languages than usual. You may select up to two additional languages beyond the three languages that all characters start with. Should you wish, you can exchange one or both of these language proficiencies for tool proficiencies. 

As an Elf, you have these special traits.

**Darkvision**: You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

**Keen Senses**: You have proficiency in the Insight, Perception, or Survival skill. 

**Trance**: You don‚Äôt need to sleep, and magic can‚Äôt put you to sleep. You can finish a¬†Long Rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.

**Resilience of the Dream:** The connection to Elmerca and Aldanor that developed during the first years of your life has left you resilient to mental and physical tolls. You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed condition, you are unaffected by mundane diseases, and you have advantage on saving throws to avoid or end magical or unusual diseases.


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
**Firstborn Gift**: You have an innate understanding of the weave of magic from your connection to Elmerca, the Wild Star, and Aldanor, the Living Tree. You choose one of the following talents.
- *Elmerca's Gift*: You know the Prestidigitation cantrip. When you finish a long rest, you can replace that cantrip with a different cantrip from the Wizard spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this gift), and for you this cantrip requires only Verbal components. 
- *Aldanor's Gift*: Your Speed increases to 35 feet, and you learn the Druidcraft cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this gift), and for you this cantrip requires only Verbal components. 
- *Gift of the Sea:* You can breathe air and water, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you learn the Shape Water cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this gift), and for you this cantrip requires only Verbal components.


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
**Elven Ritual Magic**. Your innate connection to the weave of magic allows you to learn one spell from among the choices below. You always have this spell prepared, and you may cast this spell as a ritual, even if it does not have the ritual tag. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the spell). *When you reach character level 3,* you learn a second ritual from this trait. *When you reach character level 5,* your skill with ritual magic intensifies. Spells you cast with this trait do not require Concentration, have their duration tripled (if it is not Instantaneous), and can be cast with only a 1 minute ritual. 
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Protection.**_¬†You learn the Mage Armor spell. 
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Sight.**_¬†You learn the Detect Magic spell. 
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Knowledge.**_ You learn the Comprehend Languages spell. 
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Awareness.**_¬†You learn the Locate Animals or Plants spell. 
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Speech.**_¬†You learn the Speak with Animals spell. 
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Ward.**_¬†You learn the Alarm spell.

In the Addermarch game, Nathaniel wants to be:
- A human noble from Sembara, from a very rich family
- The family has a secret connection to a fey cult of some kind
- The fey cult is associated with Lord Serenveil, Prince of the Vesperwind, Guardian of Twilight's Edge

Nathaniel wants the fey stuff to be kind of mysterious right now. I think probably Lord Serenveil makes the most sense as the lord of one of the border realms near the Sunset Gate, presumably in Sembara. Most likely this would be an associate of Ethlenn, but might make the fey stuff a little unclear as to motives (but can put that off for a while)

The rich Sembaran family with secret fey associations could be just something completely invented but if there is an obvious place for that would be interested in your opinion

Hrm. Let me think for a minute.


[9/8/2024 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
Are you thinking 1740s or 1725 or what exactly?


[9/8/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't really settled on a time yet to be honest


[9/8/2024 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
kind of waiting to see what happens with the campaign


[9/8/2024 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but probably leaning towards mid/late 1720s


[9/8/2024 2:16 PM] .deciusmus
Right.


[9/8/2024 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
Ok. A few ideas


[9/8/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
The Asa family. Sarabeth Asa was a magic user of some kind (not defined what) who fought with Cece in the hobgoblin wars and was granted Asineau manor as a reward


[9/8/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
She disappeared into (presumably) the feywild in the 1670s, and her son went looking for her and vanished in the 1710s


[9/8/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Sarabeth‚Äôs wife could have been connected to a larger fey cult


[9/8/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Or Sarabeth could have been although the family is a bit far west


[9/8/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
But I have very little made up about her, maybe the Asa family is important in the borderlands somewhere


[9/8/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
Having her connected to a fey cult would explain why Umbraeth went after her (if that is what happened haven‚Äôt actually decided why she or her son disappeared)


[9/8/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
Where is Ainseau manor?


[9/8/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
Near Cleenseau


[9/8/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
But the Asa family is from Mosteve Hills


[9/8/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
Lady Sarabeth Asa. I think I've told you her story before? She was from a small village in the Mostreve Hills, near the source of the Clavert River, in the Barony of Brumecliff. When she was granted this manor, a number of refugees from her old village settled here, including my mother. We brought with us the memories of the Wyrdling, from our old village, and still remember their miracle here, each September.


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Doesn't seem to fit the "rich family" bill very well


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
True


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Another idea. Moreau family


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
They are the barons of fellburn


[9/8/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
Very little made up about them except there are twins- a brother and sister - the brother panicked during the undead attacks against fellburn and refused to help their father


[9/8/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
When he was trapped outside the walls


[9/8/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
The brother was then exiled and the sister made baron


[9/8/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Natheniel could be a cousin or something who has gone south trying to find the exiled brother


[9/8/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
(Or I guess he could even be the exiled brother if he wants, I had a name but it was a minor detail so doesn‚Äôt have to stick with that name)


[9/8/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
(The father died)


[9/8/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
the adventure motivation is that the fey cult send Nathaniel's character to Addermarch to find out more about this mysterious alchemist in the hills, who is going to be their patron


[9/8/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is probably easier not to have a family that is tied to events in your 1720 campaign, as it anchors things too much in time and nathaniel is much more vibes based than details based


[9/8/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
A third idea is the de Brune family. They are a wealthy merchant family with connections along the Enst


[9/8/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
I have two people in the Cleenseau region established but they could easily be spread along the whole Enst valley, they are established as having connections up and down the river.


[9/8/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that actually seems pretty ideal


[9/8/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
And actually the fey bad guys in my campaign are about to screw around with Sabine de Brune, the castellan of Valit, so having the family have a secret fey connection might be something id steal


[9/8/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
is eskbridge a manor? free town?


[9/8/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
Not decided


[9/8/2024 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be a good location for Nathaniel to be from, would be easy to have news of Addermarch there


[9/8/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
so thinking maybe the de Brune family has holdings there? would require they emerge from the whole lich thing well off as I'm definitely setting this game after the lich events


[9/8/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
but also could be a different branch of the family in eskbridge or something


[9/8/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
Having the de Brunes be a secret fey cult family based in near Eskbridge (perhaps with several small manors but not the lords of eskbridge itslf) and holdings along the Enst seems perfect


[9/8/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
Eskbridge itself is a relatively small town (2000-3000) and canonically the only bridge over the Enst other than Cleenseau


[9/8/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. my thinking is an entrepenurial family with holdings along the Enst in Eskbridge could also be fairly wealthy, and would have reason to care about interests upriver in Addermarch, so the fey cult sending a younger son to investigate something would be perfect


[9/8/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
And there were some undead attacks on it and in 1720 the tyrwinghans are massing on the border but it‚Äôs been relatively unscathed and is off the main plot


[9/8/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/8/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Catherine de Brune in Cleenseau has been established as one of the wealthier people in the region (Cleenseau)


[9/8/2024 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
okay perfect. not going to develop too much of this yet until i have a better sense of how much detail Nathaniel cares about but will start from here


[9/8/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
fey patron for both Nathaniel and the family cult, is Lord Serenveil, Prince of the Vesperwind, Guardian of Twilight's Edge.

A tall, towering figure, long flowing silver hair, dark skin, dressed in robes that shift colors between deep purples, dusky blues, and silvery grays. Fiery eyes, like fading sunset.


[9/8/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
no details yet exist, but the vibe is likely an ally/lieutenant of Ethlenn guarding the sunset gate


[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
Presumably even if not a direct lieutenant it would be safe to assume he might have been used as conduit between Ethlenn and my PCs? Specifically I‚Äôve had a few hints dropped here and there that there is a fey creature in the Cleenseau region who has been occasionally dropping hints to Celyn about danger- but in a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want anyone to know I‚Äôm here‚Äù kind of way


[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, sure


[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm wondering if these fey are messengers/servants of Lord Serenveil being sheltered by the be Brunes

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
Probably just one actually


[9/8/2024 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Nathaniel likes the kind of mysterious / not clearly the "good guys" vibe so might have Serenveil be a bit more complicated than just "lieutenant of Ethlenn" but definitely he would not be allies with Umbraeth. might have his own agenda but be independently wary of Umbraeth for example


[9/8/2024 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
and of course would not be in conflict with Ethlenn


[9/8/2024 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah sure


[9/10/2024 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
started to push a bunch of addermarch stuff, fyi


[9/10/2024 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
some stuff still in stub/draft form


[9/10/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
did you ever make any sort of map


[9/10/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a hex map that is kind of half done


[9/10/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i do intend to finish it but got kind of busy at work


[9/10/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
which river is the umber


[9/10/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
Aure - main river that runs from Darkwood north past Adderfell
~ East Aure Fork ~ - the river that joins Aure from the east, just north of Adderfell
~ Main Aure Fork ~ - the river that joins Aure from the west, a bit north of Adderfell
- Umber - the river that joins the Main Aure Fork furthest west


[9/10/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
don't have the other branch (that joins Main Aure Fork between Umber and Adderfell confluence) in notes yet


[9/10/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure best way to comment, but here are a few on the Mostreve Hills:

I'm not totally sure I understand the geography.


Is your view that the four regions you have are basically what I've labeld 1/2/3/4 here:

[9/10/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/10/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
I was confused because you had "NORTH" of Latazaro swamp, took me a minute to figure out you meant south (I'm fixing)


[9/10/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
how hilly is the darkwood? is it split by the hills, or kinda more inside the "bowl"?


[9/10/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
more inside the bowl imo


[9/10/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
although also it is clearly along a watershed divide


[9/10/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think the highest ground actually runs kind of along the edge of the rivers just below 2


[9/10/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
right. maybe westcliff is more like a sideways T


[9/10/2024 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
or I guess not quite, but the land of the Darkwood itself is hilly to the west and north, less so to the south and east


[9/10/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Westcliff is kind of a big C marked in brown, with the very steep sections the two parallel lines due west

height of land being something like:

with 1 being the highest, then 2, then 4, and 3, then 5

[9/10/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[9/10/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe swapping 4 and 3


[9/10/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
or anyway 4 and 3 are pretty close. 5 is noticably less high than 3/4

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/10/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so you have in the "East Aure Fork" highlands a fair bit of bare, open ground and some alpine meadows, while in 5 ("Tyrwingha borderlands") you have more rolling hills largely forested at the summits


[9/10/2024 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
(but some of this is driven by poor soil in the 3/4 area as these are not quite as tall and definitely not as steep as 1)


[9/10/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
Geographically, the Mostreve Hills are composed of five distinct ridgelines:
* The [[Westcliff]] ridge runs in a truncated north-south 'C', on the western edge of the Mostreve Hills, with the highest and steepest parts of the ridge along the western edge, bordering the [[Maseau Gap]]. The highest peaks of the Mostreve Hills are here, especially along the western escarpment. 
* The ~Unnamed Aure Headwaters Ridge~ runs mostly east-west, arising from the rolling hills of the [[Aure]] river valley some 50 miles east of the Westcliff ridge, and cutting in a south-south-easterly line towards the headwaters of the [[~Aure East Fork~]]. This ridgeline partially separates [[Addermarch]] from the [[Darkwood]]. 
* The ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~, which runs in a north-easterly line, starting north of the [[~Aure East Fork~]]
* The ~North Tyrwinghan Ridge~ which is east of the Aure, and runs in a series of lines running north-west from the Tyrwinghan ridge. These peaks are notably gentler than the other ridges, and form less of a barrier to travel.
* The ~Orlenas Ridge~, which starts south of the [[Latazaro]] swamp and runs almost due east until it grows in the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]]


[9/10/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
In between these ridgelines are several major gaps:
* The [[Aure]] river cuts between the Westcliff and Tyrwinghan ridges, in a broad and relatively fertile river valley
* The Darkwood creeps north between the Westcliff ridge and the ~Unnamed Aure Headwaters Ridge~, forming a hilly wildland on the southern borders of [[Addermarch]]
* (Something between the Aure Headwaters Ridge and the Tyrwinghan Ridge, on the map at least it looks like it should be a hilly gap, although not sure what is here)
* Between the ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~ and the ~Orlenas Ridge~ the land is hilly but there are few high ridgelines, and multiple passes cut through the Mostreve HIlls immediately northwest of [[Orenlas]].


[9/10/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure if the ridges would actually be named, although historically in i.e. the applachian mts everything is (Blue Ridge, Smokies, WHite Mts, Green Mts, Berkshires, Poconos, etc)


[9/10/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
A few other random thoughts... 

(a) the lower Aure is somewhat unclear. Is it unsettled (if so, why)? If not (on the map it is mostly Tyrwinghan, I guess), what is the transition between Addermarch and Tyrwingha? Is there a formal border? A geographic feature

(b) the upper "Aure East Fork" also seems a bit unclear. It is hilly and impassible? Too dangerous for settlement? Too close to elves?


[9/10/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is basically right. A few small details / additions:
- The Aure Headwaters Ridge increases in height as you move to the southeast, and the soil gets poorer, so e.g. near the Aure headwaters you have the creeping edge of the Darkwood (which I think the Addermarians would see really as something that is invading their country and needs to be cut back), but by the southeastern end (headwaters of river that heads south to plaguelands) this is dry, marginal land with bad soil and can't support much in the way of forests
- The  Tyrwingan Ridge I think runs the same way in reverse, steepest/highest/worst land on the southwest end, getting better as you move north/east towards Tyrwingha
- The "East Aure River Valley" is a gap between the Aure Headers and Tyrwingan Ridge, which is not forested except in pockets, and is generally poor soil and pastureland, but supports a lot of sheep and cows potentially


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Re questions:
(a) there probably needs to be a border between Tyrwingha and Addermarch along the lower Aure. I don't think Addermarch extends all the way to the Enst


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right, agree with that, but not clear why a border. Maybe just the edge of Ethlenn's claim


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
?


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
that is probably the most obvious answer


[9/10/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
It might also make sense to run a small river from approximately "5" on the map above to the Aure, to form a border


[9/10/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
or I guess somewhere between 4 & 5


[9/10/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
i think also this is an area where there isn't a clear sense of physical borders. before drankor anyway everyone owed allegiance to an earl but they don't have physical lines, in that a village to earl A coudl be surrounded by a vilalge to earl B in theory


[9/10/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
at some point Tyrwingha probably reshuffles things (during Drankor negotiations?) so that only Ethlenn's claim is separate from Drankor


[9/10/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but no reason there needs to be a physical feature to define a border here


[9/10/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Maybe there is an ancient line of Drankorian/fey border stones


[9/10/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would be interesting


[9/10/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like that better than a river


[9/10/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the addermarch border to the north runs along the line of the cliffs (where there really isnt a border since no one lives on the very summits), and on the west side of the Aure the cliff line basically meets the river, anything north of that is "not Addermarch" but might be either Tyrwingha or Sembaran borderlands


[9/10/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
on the east of the Aure, the border with Tyrwingha is marked by ancient stones from Drankorian era with fey markings


[9/10/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
something like the blue lines

[9/10/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I was envisioning stones that went from the Aure to peak along ridge. Sorta where the blue line is but maybe a little bit south, i.e. just straighter east


[9/10/2024 6:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that works too


[9/10/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
The Tyrwinghan border, is basically then: the coast/Aure/line of markers/not defined because no one lives in the southern parts of the Tyrwinghan ridge


[9/10/2024 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
something like

[9/10/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
basically this:

where the yellow highlight is tyrwinghan border, the red x's is the fey/drankorian marker line, and the blue scribble is a height of land

[9/10/2024 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[9/10/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
so the "tyrwinghan" ridge region doesn't have "borders", it is just unsettled land between tyrwinghan and addermarch


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not totally clear on what the forset just south of the hills is though


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
that is plaguelands


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
ah. I didn't realize the stretched so far north


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
so is that river / lake all plaguelands, basically (west of Orenlas)?


[9/10/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the rivers that join just north of the big southern lake delimit the kind of outer edge of the influence of Orenlas


[9/10/2024 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
although none of this is technically canon. in the defunct Plaguelands campaign the Cinder Court (which was the main enemy) was going to be based in the forests between Orenlas and Addermarch

hard to read, but trying to say the far west blue circle is darkwood. the yellow line is about Orenlas? But the other 2 big blue circles.. are you saying those are plagueland? Or just "hrm bad stuff no people who knows what bad stuff"?


[9/10/2024 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the lower left "?" is, IMO, kinda "Darkwood++"


[9/10/2024 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
the Darkwood in my mind has this kind of "evil fey" vibe of always trying to press in and grow into the human kingdoms

this doesn't have to be canon, but:

[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
I think that's clearly Darkwood/Darkwood++


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
Twilight's Grace borders though should be adjusted to not cover addermarch


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and match the Drankorian border stones


[9/10/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/10/2024 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd move "3" down to fill it, but it also sets up Addermarch as kind of a battleground state in the feywild


[9/10/2024 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
and 3 here - covering Fellburn and Eskbridge - is potentially the domain of Nathaniel's patron and the de Brune family secret fey


[9/10/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
"3" is the "mostly Ethlenn aligned border small fey kingdoms"


[9/10/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
so fits the de Brune secret fey perfectly, although I think maybe it is a unsettled place without a clear single "master archfey domain"


[9/10/2024 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[9/10/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
Still open question what is between Tyrwinghan and Orenlas


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
which relates to Addermarch in the sense of ... why havent they expanded up the Aure East Fork valley


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
what makes that southeastern border a border?


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
in my mind, the mountains are much rougher and steeper than indicated on the world map


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[9/10/2024 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I think if you look at the topography as implied by watersheds instead of the drawn hills


[9/10/2024 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
so you really have high ridges like:

[9/10/2024 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think that is more accurate


[9/10/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
then what is the woods northeast of darkwood and west of orenlas is an open question but definitely not "human civilization"


[9/10/2024 6:25 PM] .deciusmus
I like that, lessens the need to define what is south of the hills


[9/10/2024 6:26 PM] .deciusmus
So basically, in my "five ridgelines" the big change is really that the "Aure Headwaters Ridge" runs all the way east until it connects with the Tyrwinghan Ridge


[9/10/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
and probably that area - where the ridges intersect - is the highest and roughest terrain east of Westcliff

### Borders

To the west and northwest Addermarch is bordered by the [[Westcliff]], a series of sharp cliffs and dangerous terrain that separates the realm from the flat plains of the [[Duchy of Maseau]] to the west, and the [[Borderlands|Sembaran borderlands]] to the north. At the Aure, the high ridge of [[Westcliff]] is cut by the river, and on the eastern bank, the land is much lower. Here an ancient line of border stones running to [[~High Peak of Tyrwinghan Ridge~]] demarcates the border with [[Tyrwingha]]. These stones are said by some to be raised by Drankor, but they are marked with complex warnings in [[Sylvan Writing|Sylvan]], and many believe they have fey origins.

The eastern border is not marked, as the high terrain between Addermarch and Tyrwinghan is unpopulated. The gentler, forested slopes to the north and east are under the demense of Tyrwinghan earls, and the dryer, arid slopes to the south and west, the land of Addermarian earls.

To the south, Addermarch is bordered by the high ridge of the [[Mostreve Hills]], where the headwaters of the [[~Aure East Fork~]] flow, and then, to the southwest, the [[Darkwood]]. This border is carefully watched for fear of what might creep out in the shadows.

did you push any of this? working on some updates


[9/10/2024 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
no, pushing a bit now


[9/10/2024 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
got distracted by dinner + such but looking at it now again


[9/10/2024 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed the addermarch border update


[9/10/2024 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
am pushing mostreve in a minute although still a little rough


[9/10/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
I'm pushing mostreve but I think it still needs a bit of work and some of the language is a bit rougher than what you had


[9/10/2024 8:53 PM] rsulfuratus
that's fine


[9/11/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure if you have thought much or care much about mechanical details of taelgar species, but i've been trying to rework at least the five core firstborn species a little to better capture mechanically the "unique firstborn magic" of each species. feeling pretty good about elves (ritual magic), halflings (telepathy/ancestral memory); have good ideas for lizardfolk (various prophecy/dreamworld things). stoneborn are a little unsettled because the lore is not totally clear but thinking around body transformation/resilience, things that have a vibe of like 'anime monk stuff' a little bit (this is how they are basically written now). 

dwarves are the biggest challenge. the current runic magic is, I feel, too complicated and a bit overworked (a species really doesn't need 10 options to pick from), and mechanically feel like a pretty mixed bag. 

the lore, however, i think is pretty clear, it just doesn't translate well mechanically. i have two ideas neither of which i love:

(1) make dwarven rune magic explicitly about creating an item, kind of like artificer infusions. i kind of tried to write it this way once but no one who has played a dwarf seems too interested in engaging with this

(2) make runes function kind of like origin feats, kind of modeled on feat chains from the giant sourcebook (Bigby's), which would give you kind of an alternate runic progression, but could be a lot of work to design


[9/11/2024 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
I like the basic vibe of inscribing a rune, but the current set of options is a bit complex


[9/11/2024 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
And the fact that each rune has its own set of rules and reset options makes it feel especially more complex


[9/11/2024 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
If I were trying to simplify, I think I'd 

(a) keep the basic idea of a rune you inscribe
(b) each rune would grant  one ability, approximately like a first level spell to the bearer, and the rune's magic always fades after it is used (some would in fact be 1st level spells, but some might be spell-like abilities)
(c) at 3rd level, gain the ability to mirror the rune, so when you inscribe it you keep an echo of it, allowing both you and someone else to gain the ability


[9/11/2024 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
that's a starting point... maybe needs a different 3rd level option, and a 5th level option


[9/11/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
And perhaps dwarves are then also missing a feature, i.e. if you compare to your new elf, we have

Darkvision = darkvision
Dwarven training = keen sense
stonecunning ~= resilience of dream + trance

But the rune magic above is about the same as the ritual magic of elves, so dwarves probably need something extra (esp as speed 25 feet is a penalty)


[9/11/2024 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, that is I think a useful perspective. i kind of like the style of a "firstborn gift" choice + a "firstborn magic" choice + basic species traits, so that might suggest revising dwarves to be:

darkvision (I think perhaps buffed to 120 feet as the only underground playable species in taelgar)
stonecunning
some kind of baharazel gift (that might subsume dwarven training, and would include cantrip options which don't fit well in the runic magic idea)
rune magic that is simplified and streamlined


[9/11/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Right that pattern works well in general, I think.


[9/11/2024 3:51 PM] .deciusmus
Gift of Azar's Valor: Advantage on saving throws against fright.
Gift of Maganna's Radiance. You learn the Light cantrip.
Gift of Tarbaka's Cunning. You gain proficiency in 3 tools
Gift of Azar's Training. You gain proficiency in two martial weapons, or shields.

Just ideas but they seem relatively easy to generate (2 per baharal is probably too many though)


[9/11/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I think one per Baharazel would make sense


[9/11/2024 3:53 PM] .deciusmus
Runes are a little bit harder as the set of good 1st level spells isn't massive they should probably mostly not be combat spells, and you already used a lot for elven magic and lots of overlap seems boring


[9/11/2024 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
for runes it might be worth doing a little more inventing of non-spell effects


[9/11/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
although some initial ideas, keeping to the existing runes:

Rune of Defense: Protection from Good and Evil
Rune of Delving: Find Traps
Rune of Exploration: Longstrider
Rune of Lore: Identify
Rune of Valor: Heroism


[9/11/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Rune of Stone: A reskinned Locate Object that works on ore/stone/etc only ("Locate Stone or Ore")


[9/11/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Rune of Life:  Goodberry


[9/11/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
Rune of Truth: A limited form of Zone of Truth?


[9/11/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
This list doesn't have Aid or the Forge. Unseen Servant for something maybe? Purify Food and Drink?


[9/11/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
Not committed to any of the above, but it doesn't seem that hard to come up with a decent list


[9/11/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think this is probably the right direction. am going to fiddle a bit but i think the design is probably something like:
- Baharazel's Blessing (which is aimed to be roughly 1/2 as strong as an origin feat, so kind of on par with e.g. Firstborn's Gift + keen sense from elves)
- Tremorsense, improved darkvision, 30 foot speed as "main basic features"
- Rune magic which is designed to be a little weaker than Elven magic. probably something like one choice of spell or spell like effect, can use prof/2 times per day, but never learn a second effect


[9/11/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
**Bahrazel's Blessing.** Your innate connection to the Bahrazel provides you with a supernatural blessing. Choose one of the following options: 
- *Tarbaka's Blessing of Craft.* You learn the Mending cantrip. In addition, you have an uncanny ability to understand raw materials and how to shape them. You gain proficiency in two Artisan's Tool of your choice. When you Craft items with your chosen Tool, you require only half the time and raw materials that would normally be required.
- *Maganna's Blessing of Elements.* You learn two cantrips from among Light, Elementalism, Gust, Shape Water, Control Fire, and Mold Earth.
- *Azar's Blessing of Strength.* Your Hit Point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level. 
- *Oshkir's Blessing of Life.* You learn the Guidance and Spare the Dying cantrips. 
- *Uzdan's Blessing of *
- *Karthel's Blessing of *
- *Fanrukel's Blessing of *


[9/11/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
Is Maganna really related to elements? Does that fit the lore?


[9/11/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
not really but i kinda want an elemental option on there since Mold Earth has been so central to Seeker


[9/11/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
and Riswynn has Shape Water from her dwarf background


[9/11/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe that should be Karthel (runecrafter)?


[9/11/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, that might work better


[9/11/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
- *Fanrukel's Blessing of Shaping.* You learn two cantrips from among Elementalism, Shape Water, Mold Earth, Gust, Control Flames, or Light.


[9/11/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
possibly adding Thaumatury as an option as well. It is most of the non-combat Transmutation cantrips, plus Light


[9/11/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
oops meant Karthel


[9/11/2024 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Maganna's Blessing of Communication. You learn the Message cantrip, and in addition you gain proficiency in 3 additional languages.


[9/11/2024 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
that's good


[9/11/2024 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
Izgil (the dwarf in my game) uses this ability not infrequently:

When the bearer of the rune makes a ability check that uses the Arcana, History, or Religion skills (or related Knowledge competencies), and rolls a 9 or lower on the d20, they can activate this rune to treat the number rolled as a 10. Once this effect is activated, it cannot be used until the rune is inscribed again. The number of uses increases to two at 5th level and three at 11th level.


[9/11/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably a better fit for a rune than a gift though, if I was trying to keep it


[9/11/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that could be the basis of a decent rune


[9/11/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
Eric also uses Seeker's sense ore a reasonable amount, which could also be a good rune


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
right; the real issue for Izgil is that he also uses Identify from his rune a fair bit, so hard to make an exact equivalent (i.e. because it might make sense to have 2 runes one for identify, one for a "ability check take 10" - but neither of those are a great fit for a gift, and I'm not sure if he'd want to trade)


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
well if you did update to new rules, the solution would be to get Identify from your origin feat


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
you mean via magic initiate or whatever


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[9/11/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually I'm wondering if the knowledge thing might work as Fanrukel's Blessing of Lore


[9/11/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
It feels maybe a little powerful to have an infinite set of uses


[9/11/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah you'd either need to limit to one skill and lower the floor to 8, or give it limited uses i think


[9/11/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually since Identify is a ritual spell, it is not unreasonable to have unlimited uses of that


[9/11/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
that might be a better Fanrukel's Blessing of Lore actually


[9/11/2024 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
That's true


[9/11/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
it is slightly duplicative of the vibe of elven ritual magic but i think reasonable in this case


[9/11/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
identify definitely is an dwarven-associated spell by vibes


[9/11/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think one case where you have a ritual is fine here


[9/11/2024 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
If you are doing rules stuff would it make sense to push it in the ‚Äúplaying species‚Äù mechanics rather than only D&D beyond? Easier to read/edit that way

A few thoughts on Dwarves:

Binthuhr dwarves: I think they should get an origin feat + bonus skill prof. Just origin feat seems weak. (Although maybe from a lore perspective binthuhr dwarves should be weaker?)

Blessings:
a) Maganna's Blessing of Communication. The change-language-on-long-rest feels good and interesting. I'd keep it.

b) Uzdan's Blessing of Leadership. Fine for now. I do think something that isn't just a worse musician or worse inspiring leader would be better. I prefer this to a temp HP as from a flavor perspective "musician" is very specific


[9/12/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Binthuhr, the logic is 120 feet darkvision is as good as a skill proficiency, so compared to humans they are fairly balanced. but also i don't really expect anyone to play one so i'm not sure how much it really matters. the main goal is to make them not feel obviously stronger than regular dwarves


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I guess it depends on whether human heroic inspiration is really balanced against stonecunning or not


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I guess slightly weaker than human is fine though


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I don't have strong feelings


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
And I can see how origin feat + skill might make them seem arguably stronger, which is bad


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
So you are probably right


[9/12/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah humans are fairly strong as it is so slightly weaker is not bad imo, the main goal is if Isaac is reading the new dwarf his first thought is not "why i am i bothering with a thuhr?"




[9/12/2024 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Isaac will almost certainly pick that for his Taelgar dwarf so planning on just seeing if 10 minutes feels too weak, that is best to just playtest imo


[9/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
what about:

#### Tarbaka's Flame Ward
**Casting Time:**¬†1 Action
**Range:**¬†Self
**Components:**¬†V, S, M
**Duration:**¬†1 hour

One of your appendages becomes immune to fire damage. While this effect is active, you can use your Reaction when you take Fire damage to gain resistance to the triggering damage. The first melee attack you make on your next turn that hits does an additional 1d6 fire damage.

When you use your Reaction in this way, the Flame Ward ends.


[9/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
Basically Absorb Elements but with a long term secondary effect


[9/12/2024 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that actually, gives it a bit more utility if you want to hop through lava or something


[9/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
(and actually absorb elements gives you resistance to all damage of the trggering type until the start of your next turn)


[9/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
(which I'd keep)


[9/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
So basically... 1 hour duration for the "appendage immunity" plus a one-time usage of absorb elements (fire). 

Feels balanced (it is basically mechanically similar to just being able to cast absorb elements) but with a nice fun rider effect


[9/12/2024 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
now teaching so offline for 3 hours


[9/13/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
I was messing around with a D&D 2024 version of Delwath a bit... D&D Beyond is tough to use as I can't select old-school invocations like Ghostly Gaze


[9/13/2024 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
But... broadly, I'd be tempted (assuming I do this when going to level 12 warlock)
(a) rearrange stats slightly to drop WIS to 10
(b) which lets me boost starting CHA to 17
(c) which means I can get to 20 via ASI @ 4th and War Caster @ 8th (which now gives a +1 to CHA)
(d) which means my 8 invocations are:
- Pact of the Blade
- Thirsting + Devouring Blade
- Ghostly Gaze
- Eye of the Rune Keeper (so weak they removed it, but important for flavor)
- 3 others TBD

That drops Eldritch Mind (which is replaced with War Caster) and Improved Pact Weapon (which I might add back in)


[9/13/2024 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
Ideas:
Ascendant Step (Levitate @ will)
Devil's Sight
Master of Myriad Forms
Visions of Distant Realms
Lifedrinker (but I don't really like the flavor)


[9/13/2024 9:58 AM] .deciusmus
or adding back in Improved Pact Weapon, although mechanically it kinda boring in that it is just effectively a +1 to hit/damage


[9/13/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
there is a lot that is still a little buggy about the 2024 D&D Beyond implementation, but hopefully a lot of these will be fixed by the time it officially releases on 9/17 (so before Colorado)


[9/13/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
(e.g. selecting older invocations)


[9/13/2024 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
yeah less worried about the actual implementation than just playing around with possibilities


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
I assume you'd have no objection to tweaking stats (the fact that War Caster gives +1 CHA now makes it a lot more compelling than Eldritch Mind)


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that's fine


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
are you planning on taking metamagic adept at 12?


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/13/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
4th level is ASI, 8th War Caster, 12th Metamagic Adept


[9/13/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
nets a +3 CHA, so then tweak starting stats to have 17 CHA (15 from point buy + 2 from background) to keep CHA 20 @ 8th level


[9/13/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
but that means dropping WIS or INT to 10 from 12


[9/13/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
then the main changes would be:
* Origin Feat (not thought about it yet)
* between 2 and 4 invocations


[9/13/2024 11:07 AM] .deciusmus
(where 2 would be if I kept Improved Pact Weapon + Eye of Rune Keeper; 4 would be if I replaced Eye of Rune Keeper with Comprehend Languages and also dropped Improved Pact Weapon)


[9/13/2024 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
I think spells are the same (other than being able to change Green Flame Blade to something actually useful, although I *almost* used it against the minions in the battle with the vine)


[9/13/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
I would argue you should keep Eye of the Rune Keeper for story reasons, but dropping Improved Pact Weapon certainly makes sense if there is something more interesting


[9/13/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
Delwath has been using Alter Self a lot, so Master of Myriad Forms might be a thematic and useful choice


[9/13/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
that would also free up a spell known


[9/13/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
Would you consider an upgrade to Eye of the Rune Keeper to be

Senses of the Rune Keeper
You can understand the literal meaning of any language you hear or see signed, and the literal meaning of any writing you see.


[9/13/2024 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
(Basically Comprehend Language @ will, without the limit of "touching the writing"


[9/13/2024 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
Given most invocations are non-ritual spells at will, it doesn't seem overpowered


[9/13/2024 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus
(on a meeting, more later)


[9/13/2024 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
I think I'd be tempted by Ascendant Step (basically to save on Fly casting for simple things like drifting to the ground from Vdrinjashra or not having to climb) and Master of Myriad Forms.

Then still need to think about Improved Pact Weapon


[9/13/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
okay a few thoughts:

(1) On Rune Keeper: for Delwath, I don't think it really matters at all one way or the other, since of course the situations where (a) you want to understand what someone is saying, and (b) you can't spare a spell slot to cast Tongues are exceedingly rare, and anyway Kenzo can already understand all languages. 
But, in general, I'm not a big fan of "understand all language all the time" as a invocation, it feels like it really cuts off a good chunk of using language as a meaningful mechanical barrier. I'm actually not a fan of the decision in the new PHB to just collapse everything into "just Ritual cast it", e.g. I think that the Beast Speech and the Eldritch Sight invocations are interesting and still useful.


[9/13/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) On other invocations: completely fine with any of those choices.


[9/13/2024 12:39 PM] .deciusmus
On Eyes of the Rune Keeper, mostly it is just substantially weaker than Comprehend Languages. So in many ways I'm not sure it is really interesting given Comprehend Languages is very easy to get


[9/13/2024 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
(and there is a bit of a "keeping up with the jones" effect for Delwath specifically, where it feels odd that as the one with massive Charisma / party face role he is substantially behind Kenzo in the "understand what you are saying" department)


[9/13/2024 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
well, that depends on whether the 'takes 10 minutes to cast' and 'have to touch writing' are meaningful or not


[9/13/2024 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, from a invocation standpoint, an invocation that lets you cast a first level spell at will is pretty standard


[9/13/2024 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
so it isn't even ritual cast, so much as just "cast without a spell slot"


[9/13/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
from the point of view of delwath, as I said, I don't think it really matters


[9/13/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm just not convinced from a game design perspective that having a low-level invocation that lets you understand all spoken and writing language at will is something i would want to homebrew


[9/13/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
From a balance standpoint, if I were designing an invocation that let you cast a 1st level spell, that was already a ritual, at will, I'd make it a little better than the spell is my only point.


[9/13/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
as it trivializes language choice


[9/13/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
Isn't language choice already trivialized by the existence of Comprehend Languages at some level?


[9/13/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
There are a bunch of other ways to "trivialize" language choice, i.e. Magic Initiate or Ritual Caster, they all require choosing to do so


[9/13/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
a little, but to me it feels different to have an ability that says "you just understand everything" as opposed to having a spell you can cast


[9/13/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
to me, ritual casting Comprehend Languages is rarely, if ever, useful for the spoken word part


[9/13/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
I guess. I think the game effect of the difference is fairly minimal.


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
Really? There are lots of situations where you know you are going into a social situation and in most games taking 10 min to ritual cast before you do is pretty easy to do


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. the main circumstance you'd want to understand language but not speak it is when you are eavesdropping or similar, and typically you wouldn't have 10 minutes to ritual cast


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but comprehend doesn't let you speak, just understand


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
sure, but that is still useful in any social situation, i.e. where the other people might talk in their own language


[9/13/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
I think D&D already has a mechanical issue with languages because they are binary


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess it is just my dmign style, i can't think of a time i've had npcs have a side conversation in a different language, but i do sometimes have enemies yell to each in other in combat


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
*side conversation during a social situation


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
The giants


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
but Delwath had already cast tongues


[9/13/2024 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[9/13/2024 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
Plus some stuff in Ursk where casting a spell wasn't possible


[9/13/2024 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, i don't think it matter for delwath and it is perfectly reasonable for delwath to just understand all languages


[9/13/2024 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
Scrying is another scenario


[9/13/2024 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right but when you are scrying there is basically no situation in which you can't just cast tongues


[9/13/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
Its a big tax on slots to have to cast tongues


[9/13/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, realistically, I guess it rarely matters. But I'm always nervous to burn 2 slots in that type of situation


[9/13/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
(and back when I only had 2 slots and was spamming scrys, a ritual comprehend is much better use of time than scry + tongues)


[9/13/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
My point is actually just a philosophical one, which is that from a pure in world usefulness perspective, I don't really think "read all writing without touching it" necessarily would win over "cast comprehend languages as written as a ritual"


[9/13/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i think what i would actually do if I were homebrewing this from first principles is leave eyes of the rune keeper as a 2+ level invocation, and then make a new higher level invocation that is you can understand all spoken or written language


[9/13/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
See from a pure homebrew balance perspective I think it doesn't work once warlocks have access to ritual spells


[9/13/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps you'd make eyes of the rune keeper be: "You always have the Comprehend Languages spell prepared. In addition, you can read all writing/"


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
That is closer to balanced


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe not worth taking? i'm not sure. i mean, delwath took eyes of the rune keeper a while ago and i think got a fair bit of value out of it


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
of course 2024 warlocks couldn't ritual cast and had much more limited slots...


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but Delwath had no option to take Comprehend Languages


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
and no option to ritual cast


[9/13/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
*2014 warlocks


[9/13/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
If I could have just learned Comprehend Language as a spell and been able to ritual cast? I'm not sure Eyes of the Rune Keeper is worth it over some other invocation


[9/13/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
For example, if it was a choice between Comprehend Languages as a known spel + Alter Self at will, vs Alter Self as a known spell + Eyes of the Rune Keeper it isn't even a close decision


[9/13/2024 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
sure. i mean in 2014 alter self at will was 15+ level. there is a lot of power creep in the 2024 warlock, more than many other classes


[9/13/2024 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus
which i have mixed feelings about because I think some of the lower-power invocations mechanically are very flavorful (also see the doesn't need to sleep one), but the more powerful invocations become the more feel-bad it is to take those


[9/13/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
what would be more flavorful imo is scaling invocations, or at least "low level" and "high level" versions. e.g., at 3rd level or whatever, "read all writing" isn't necessarily a bad choice. by 5th level, you probably want it to be stronger, and by 12th level definitely. 

but you could do something like:
(no level req): read all writing
(requires 5th level): understand all written, spoken, signed language
(requiress 11th level): understand all written, spoken, signed language. cast tongues at will. 
(requires 17th level): understand and speak any written, spoken, signed language. you can use spell scrolls of any class.


[9/13/2024 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, not sure any of this really matters for delwath specifically, who i think should just get a homebrew invocation


[9/13/2024 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
sure, although if you are offering up "cast tongues at will" for I wouldn't say no


[9/14/2024 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
what do you think of this? 

Uzdan's Blessing of Leadership. When you finish a [rule]Long Rest[/rule], you can inspire bravery in yourself and your allies. Choose a number of creatures up to your Proficiency Bonus. Each target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Proficiency Bonus. While a character has these Temporary Hit Points, they are immune to the [condition]Frightened[/condition].


[9/14/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
This is supposed to be about 1/2 a origin feat?


[9/14/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
Inspiring Leader feat is character level not prof bonus temp HP... I think this is balanced on its own, in a way, but it seems unfortunate it doesn't synergize with inspiring leader feat. It feels like a character who wants this kind of thing might want to take both, but they kinda clash


[9/14/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
about to go out for a bit, but yeah, it is tough to get something satisfying because temp hp effects all clash with each other. 

and it is hard to think of other good effects that have the flavor of "inspiring allies" and aren't too complicated

the other option I thought about was just a "fear resistance aura" - you have advantage on saves against being Frightened, as do all allies within 30 feet of you or something. not tied to rest, just always-on


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
is there anything canonical about when Umbreath established Duskmire? in the Duskmire note you have in the 600s but is that set in stone? 

i'm dropping a warning stone in the next adventure for my Addermarch campaign that is near a place of easy travel (not quite a portal, but a place where fey can cross to the material plane with less effort)


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to figure out what language the warning signs might be in


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing canonical.


[9/16/2024 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
But it has to be before Cloudspinner was imprisoned


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i was more wondering about pushing it back a bit. 600s would be when Drankor had already established in Addermarch


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
say to 200 or 300


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
For the expansion narrative to work. Could be much older though. Who knows how long Umbraeth was hanging out in the Darkwood


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so by the time Drankorians arrive, the Ethlenn/Umbaeth split has already happened


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that probably works


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realm in the Cleenseau folder has a few hints


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
will take a look


[9/16/2024 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
But something like 250-300 would work fine.


[9/16/2024 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
I think


[9/16/2024 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
on a totally separate D&D topic - I realized recently when talking to Isaac that Epic Boons just have a character level 19 requirement, so you can technically take them at any level that gives you a feat as long as you are character level 19. 

so theoretically if Delwath were willing to give up 9th level spells, you could take an epic boon at both warlock 16/sorcerer 3, and warlock 16/sorcerer 4


[9/16/2024 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
(which would also give you 22 Cha)


[9/16/2024 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
Also means giving up a 4th pact magic slot


[9/16/2024 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
ah that's true. that might be worth more than the 1/day 9th level spell


[9/16/2024 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
I mean it will be a while. Would take sor 4 before level 20 anyway. So can wait and see


[9/16/2024 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
true


[9/18/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
I'm doing a little notes cleanup and just reading some random scattered things...

For something like the winter market for halflings in Adderfell (which would tie in nicely to Viatela (which doesn't have a good note, itself, but..)

What's the best way to suggest something like that? Change the text and tag status/tim? Just chat in discord?


[9/19/2024 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I've been super busy at work - just looking at D&D now. I think add a comment to the note and tag status/tim, possibly also mention on Discord


[9/19/2024 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
btw, I'm working on updating homebrew subclasses to 2024 rules. one clear design trend (which I don't feel completely obligated to stick) is to limit the accessibility of half-caster-exclusive spells. hexblade by default has a lot of paladin smite spells on its expanded list. other than banishing smite, delwath almost never uses any of them, so i am considering replacements, maybe just keeping 2 smites (banishing + one other)


[9/19/2024 11:03 PM] .deciusmus
It is mechanically useful to have a non-concentration smite in addition to banishing but 3 smites is probably excessive


[9/19/2024 11:04 PM] .deciusmus
It might be nice to homebrew a themed smite or two


[9/19/2024 11:07 PM] .deciusmus
Yalik'i‚Äôs smite of frost 
1d8 cold damage/level
Save or restrained (or maybe just zero speed or reduced speed) until end of next turn


[9/19/2024 11:09 PM] .deciusmus
Blinding smite could be
Nishir‚Äôs smite of the talons
(Effect like poking at eyes?)


[9/20/2024 12:01 AM] rsulfuratus
here is my current list. struggling with level 3; a homebrew smite could work there (although you could also just take the eldritch smite invocation for a non-concentration, non-bonus-action smite).

1st level: sleep (theme connection: moonlight, evening, night); shield (theme connection: hunter)
2nd level: invisibility (theme connection: sneaking up on prey), Mind Spike (theme connection: tracking, hunter **not sure about this one**)
3rd level: Fly? Conjure Animals? Spirit Shroud? Blinding Smite? surprisingly few hunter/moon/night/sleep/forest associated 3rd level spells
4th level: Fount of Moonlight (theme: moonlight, hunter; mechanically similar to spirit shroud - could drop this for spirit shroud at 3rd), Hallucinatory Terrain (theme: camouflage for the hunt)
5th level: Banishing Smite (theme: hunter), Dream (theme: sleep - scrying is also potentially thematic, of course doesn't matter for delwath since you use both of those spells a lot)

Some of the stuff on the current list (enthrall, tongues, ice storm) I can't figure out what the rationale was. 

Open to suggestions especially for 3rd and possibly something better than Mind Spike for 2nd. Or something else for 4th to replace Fount of Moonlight, and then would be easy to add Spirit Shroud to 3rd.


[9/20/2024 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
recalling that I think we had decided the flavor of the subclass was "Meswati" not just Yezali, rethinking spells a bit:

level 1: shield (yezali); sleep (midri, hibernation)
level 2: invisibility (yezali, tracking/sneaking up on prey); alter self or spider climb or ?? (k'onisati, transformation)
level 3: ??? (yezali - maybe spirit shroud if replace 4th level yezali option), tongues (taraka, communication/stories)
level 4: fount of moonlight (yezali), ice storm (yalik'i)
level 5: banishing smite (yezali), scrying (nisir)

possible alternative spells for each tanshi:
yalik'i: detect thoughts (2nd - the "listen everywhere" and "clear thoughts" vibes), calm emotions (2nd - also "clear thoughts" theme), rime's binding ice (2nd), cone of cold (5th), armor of agathys (1st)
k'onisati: polymorph (4th, transformation), giant insect (4th, *although the new version of this spell has some broken interactions), fly (3rd, insect/transformation), longstrider (1st), jump (1st)
nisir: arcane eye (4th), see invisibility (2nd)

tongues seems obvious for taraka
for yezali lots of alternatives even avoiding smites 

happy to take your suggestions just wasn't sure why we picked some of the old spells, and kind of feel like additional smites beyond banishing are kind of unneeded (another concentration option probably rarely gets used; blinding could be a 3rd level non-concentration option although if you have a spare invocation eldritch smite is much better since it doesn't take a bonus action and you can stack it with banishing smite)


[9/20/2024 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
The current structure has a Yezali themed spell each level, plus a 2nd one from a different tanshi.

So that comes out as:

1st Level: Shield (Yezali) / Sleep (Midri, hiberation)
2nd Level: Shining Smite (Yezali) / Enthrall (K'onisati / shimmering/distraction of butterflies)
3rd Level: Blinding Smite / Tongues (taraka/stories)
4th Level: Shadow of Moil / Ice Storm (yaliki)
5th Level: Banishing Smite / SCryhing (Nisir)


[9/20/2024 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
I actually like all 5 of the non-Yezali ones and don't see any reason to change them


[9/20/2024 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
I am planning on taking alter self at will as an invocation, so having it as a spell is very meh. Spider climb is fine-ish, but I actually used Enthrall at least once in game, so I'd rather not arbirtarily take it away


[9/20/2024 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
For the Yezali spells on the other hand, happy to move away from "all smites" if you are feeling like they should be more restricted.


[9/20/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
Happy to swap Fount of Moonlight for Spirit Shroud, Fount of Moonlight is better for sure than Shadow of Moil themeatically, and functionally close enough toSpirit shroud that it doesn't matter




[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think status/stub should actually mean "no status info set yet" not "just needs a header"


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
my dm notes are typically organized by session, I don't usually pre-create notes


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that makes sense


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
when you go back, you can switch to status/cleanup/header if that is all it needs

{Reactions}

[9/22/2024 7:12 PM] .deciusmus
My workflow is usually..

make a list in the DM folder for session prep
if I make an image, create a page to hold the image in DM
if the PCs actually met the person, move page to People


[9/22/2024 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
but anyway, I think status/stub = no one has set the DM info and only the creator of the page should remove it


[9/22/2024 7:19 PM] rsulfuratus
here is another edge case. 

i have a few notes where the only missing information is whereabouts. there aren't any additional useful dm_notes and I have no plans, but their locations at certain times is canonical. 

inclination is just status/cleanup/header with a comment "%% canonical whereabouts between XX and YY not captured yet%% as it is a pretty rare edge case


[9/22/2024 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that seems reasonable.


[9/22/2024 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
here's another tricky one...

Lambert Talwrey. He's dead, but the PCs were invstigating his murder. Other than a convinent dead body, no details about him.

The details of the murderer, however, are complex.


[9/22/2024 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
is the murderer linked from the note? if yes i'm not sure how this is different from my Einrik / cursed dagger example


[9/22/2024 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
right, I guess its the same


[9/22/2024 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
the murderer was a fey changeling, but I thinked both the actual fey and the person she was changed into


[9/22/2024 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
*linked


[9/22/2024 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
here's another one I'm not sure on.

Remille Vauclaire. A ranger and low-ish level fighter. Originally from Adderfell. 

no real details or plans, but she is currently on the periphry of key events in Aveil in my game, so always a chance she somehow gets involved.

Just set dm_plans: yes? Or something else


[9/22/2024 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
(the whereabouts tracks her location accurately, but you'd have to know where my next couple of sessions are going to be to know she is nearby to them...)


[9/22/2024 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah probably just dm_plans: yes is sufficient there


[9/22/2024 8:47 PM] .deciusmus

just a stub for now


[9/22/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
for someone like Tristan, where there are lots of notes but all in shared email, but where I have plans:

status/needswork/shared
dm_notes: none
dm_plans: yes

right?


[9/22/2024 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/22/2024 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
ok i've finished all the sembaran people


[9/22/2024 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
and for someone like Marcel de Valarin, where I have
(a) nothing really written
(b) bullet notes in %% on the page
(c) plans

It would be:
status/needswork/internal
dm_notes: none
dm_plans: yes

right?


[9/22/2024 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i have something similar for Caradoc in Addermarch


[9/22/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
although if all the relevant information is on the page in note form, shouldn't it be status/cleanup/internal?


[9/22/2024 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
needswork/internal implies there is missing info in other notes that you need to collate

[9/22/2024 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, here is one.

Agon, Vola's mentor in Chardon. the note is complete except for secrets. tagged dm_notes: important and dm_plans: yes

does it need a status tag?


[9/22/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
no


[9/22/2024 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
also: what is the difference between status/cleanup/header and status/metadata/header? 

is cleanup/header just a replacement for metadata/header?


[9/22/2024 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
that's your call üôÇ


[9/22/2024 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
but yes, I think they are the same


[9/22/2024 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
dunno if metadata/header or cleanup/header is better


[9/22/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i think metadata/header is better
cleanup | needswork to me imply text editing

metadata/header, metadata/image, metadata/map is non-text editing

[9/22/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i am changing now


[9/22/2024 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed


[9/22/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
here's one.. Avatus.

I dropped lots of hints about him in my Cleenseau game, but all as deep background/history and backstory for why there was a buried fort and/or various hobgoblin skeletons coming to life


[9/22/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
Ultimately whatever the "real" details it could have come down to 1720 garbled, so nothing I dropped necessarily has to be canonical


[9/22/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
dm_notes: color?


[9/22/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[9/22/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
long dead fey:
People/Fey or People/historical figures ?


[9/22/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
i moved needswork/rewrite to cleanup and recategorized all the notes with that tag as either cleaup/internal or cleanup/external

cleanup/internal implies you can fix the page just by what is on the page
cleanup/external implies color details or other non-crucial information might need to be collated from other sources

example: Cavarrio's Chronicles of Drankor needs to be rewritten into a proper source, as it is supposed to represent an in-world book. i have a few notes about possible errors in Cavarrio's work but nothing canonical (otherwise would be: dm_notes: important). but, if anyone wants to do this, it requires at least collating with the "correct" Drankorian history and so is a bit more complex than, e.g., the similar "Story about Hags" which just needs a quick Taelgarification


[9/22/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
does that make sense?


[9/22/2024 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
similar: 

Marcella is [person, status/needswork/external, status/metadata/header, status/cleanup/internal] with a note 
%% need to fix whereabouts, campaign info, away dates %%
%% fix text to change session links %%

the implication is supposed to be than anyone could rewrite the text to remove "Felt forced to try to steal from party in [[Session 44 (DuFr)]]," into a dufr campaign block. 

but also tagged status/needswork/external to indicate there is important information not captured


[9/22/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure that is super clear but also not sure it really matters?


[9/22/2024 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
right i mean i'm the only one who is likely to be working on marcella's note


[9/22/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
what's the right tag for "factually accurate but feels a like sparse"


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
although, re: marcella and similar, the reason to tag status/cleanup/internal is that theoretically it would be feasible for you to rewrite some of those pages (e.g., Marcella, Hektor, other NPCs you encountered) that currently have a lot of bare session note links into something a little cleaner


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
does that need a tag?


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
I guess not


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
re: marcella I think the main thing is that the external tag implies that the information on the page isn't really adequately complete


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
although if there is something that feels sparse that you know is a page I created, status/tim and a %% is reasonable


[9/22/2024 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
So i.e. a page wth
dm_notes: color
status/cleanup/internal

feels like, hey, a rewrite will be ok

status/needswork/external
implies that you can't trust the page


[9/22/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
ah i see so the combination of both tags is confusing


[9/22/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the proper tag for "information is correct but badly incomplete"


[9/22/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
status/cleanup/external?


[9/22/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
I think dm_notes: importat


[9/22/2024 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for marcella nothing is misleading or wrong about the text but 
(a) the header whereabouts are badly incomplete
(b) there are additional important details in my notes (dm_notes: important)
(c) the page itself needs a rewrite to both fix internal linking and incorporate external notes that give more crucial information


[9/22/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
I would call that status/metadata/header, status/cleanup/internal


[9/22/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
dm_notes: important


[9/22/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm. 

i feel like it is useful for me to have a tag that says "there is external information i need to copy to this page" that is distinct from "i have important dm notes"


[9/22/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
right, see I haven't been bothering with that


[9/22/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
I think status/cleanup/<whatever you want to use>


[9/22/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
or just status/<whatever you want to use>


[9/22/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
you could do something like status/onenote separate from the rest of the status tagging we are doing


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, so for you the crucial thing is:
needswork -> the page can't be used because the information is misleading, non-canon, so incomplete as to prevent meaningful use in a game
cleanup -> the page might not be complete in some abstract sense but it isn't missing any critical information


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
The main thing to me is that

(a) status/needswork means "don't trust the page"
(b) status/needswork/<internal|shared> means "but the way to fix it is in obsidian or shared email


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
anything else is less important to me


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
oh, and status/stub means "creator has to finish creating it"


[9/22/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay. so i can use whatever status/cleanup subtags I want and you don't really care if they have meaning to you, as long as the "cleanup" / "needswork" distinction is maintained and "internal" / "shared" have consistent meaning


[9/22/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
yes

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
It would be good to agree on a tag for "the page has all the details" as well (to distinguish from "obsidian has the details")


[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
I think earlier we said status/cleanup/internal


[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I am using internal for this


[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
consistently across cleanup and needswork, where needswork/internal implies usually that obsidian has the details (as otherwise it would just be cleanup/internal)

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i think internal just means "in obsidian", shared means "discord/email", external means "something only the creator can access"

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think generally cleanup/internal should be reserved for "rewrite the page without external references"


[9/22/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
there are a few pages where we both might have dm notes.. i.e. the Rangers


[9/22/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
I guess earlier we said we'd try to keep the notes in obsidian for those


[9/22/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think okay to see how things shake out a bit


[9/22/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
if we find there are tags that don't make sense or are unclear can just refactor easily with the tag manager in obsidian


[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
also we should try to check the needswork pages to clean up the ones that don't actually need work (in general, i would assume that if a page has a dm_notes/dm_plans frontmatter the status tag is correct, if not then maybe not)

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
I've been fixing status tags as a I go


[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
I aslos added a missing dm info page in MoC


[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i saw


[9/22/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder if there is use in having something like a dm_notes: shared


[9/22/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
for pages we know we are both going to be potentially referencing, i.e. Shattered Ice Clan, Rangers, some Feywild stuff


[9/22/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean that should never really happen, if we both have dm_notes we should be doing it in  comments on the page, or in worldbuilding if particularly complex

a dm_plans: [clee, adm] might be useful though?


[9/22/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
dm_notes: color|important|none is a logical OR operation. if either of us have dm notes it gets set to the highest level


[9/22/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
with the goal of eventually moving all DM notes to %% for shared things


[9/22/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but I guess if it is useful to track where that hasn't happened yet, dm_notes: shared could be good?


[9/22/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
or if it useful to track places where there are multiple %% canon from XXX %% notes?


[9/22/2024 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but in some ways plans are better - e.g. if your PCs go to adderfell, setting dm_plans: [clee] and tagging status/tim is a good way to mark that I need to dump anything useful, but really discord is best for this


[9/22/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/22/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
probably lets stick with what we agreed and not overthink fo rnow


[9/22/2024 10:22 PM] .deciusmus
I'm stopping for the night: one last thought.

I'm using "needswork/shared" as a rough shorthand for pages that I created originally but where I have no particular information, but also where the info in obsidian is inadequate, i.e. the highland kingdoms


[9/22/2024 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
I also think that "PCs will go to a place at some point" is not a good reason for dm_plans: yes


[9/23/2024 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
Is it fair to say that any place with status/stub and a ~ name is fair to fixup and set dm_notes/dm_plans to no?


[9/23/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
Also, is it fair to set status/cleanup/internal rather than status/needswork/internal when there is not much made up, but some of it is on well-organized backlinks rather than the page itself?


[9/23/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I think status/cleanup/internal is reasonable for notes where most information is available but only through backlinks, yes


[9/23/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
For this, I guess with the exception of places that are not "clearly on the map"


[9/23/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
(I have a few minutes while I eat lunch, and I'm trying to reduce the number of status/stub so when I add new pages with status/stub it is easier to find them)


[9/23/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
re: status/stubs, I'm not sure that is entirely correct? i guess the concept of dm_plans for places is a little nebulous. but lots of status/stub pages i do actually have notes. e.g. Emerald Coast, Northern Boreal Forest, North Chardon Coast, Great Desert, Eastern Islands


[9/23/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess setting them to status/needswork/<something> and dm_notes: no might be fine and accomplish the same thing


[9/23/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess my point is there are plenty of place stubs that are in the "can't be used without more info" category


[9/23/2024 1:46 PM] .deciusmus
that's kinda what I mean by "clearly on the map"


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm a little confused. the North Chardon Coast is clearly on the map, is it not?


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but i have a fair bit of notes in a totally disorganized and not-necessarily-canon bunch of dm notes on the chardonian empire


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] .deciusmus
Yes, that is. 
Great Desert / Eastern Islands are not


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so it isn't really "a place you can use" as if you wanted to send your players there I'd need to sort out what is color, what is important, etc


[9/23/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess that's true. In that sense, leaving as stub is important actually


[9/23/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure that "clearly on the map" is an accurate guide to whether a place stub has unincorporated dm information is all i'm saying


[9/23/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
if you need to get rid of my stubs you can tag things you don't know what to do with status/stub-tim or something


[9/23/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
or status/stub, status/tim and just exclude things with status/tim from your stub search


[9/23/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
no, if you have a lot of places with unincorporated DM notes I won't bother


[9/23/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
I was vaguely assuming you didn't have a lot of notes about regions that were not in obsidian except for the "weird" places on the far edges of things


[9/23/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
but I guess a lot of the places Great Library campaign went to you probably do have notes in OneNote or whatever


[9/23/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
the west coast is in kind of bad shape, it has (a) a bunch of great library stuff, and (b) a bunch of half made up notes when I thought you were going to go to Chardon and deal with Fausto directly before looking for the jade pieces  or on the way to the merfolk kelp


[9/23/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
and the whole chasa river valley / elderwood is all pre-obsidian so has a lot of stubs too


[9/23/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
have you considered at all why werewolves turn during the full moon?


[9/23/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
is it just that pandemonium is closer to taelgar? something else? just pondering in relationship to my PC who is dedicated to the moon


[9/23/2024 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I wrote this as an intro during the werewolf arc but nothing beyond the implications here:

The world turns, night falls, and the stars begin to flicker in the sky over Dunmar. As the Fox and Hunter drift above the horizon, they watch the full moon rising for the 2,514th time, and listen. Their attention, as always, is drawn to the east, and north, where the prayers are the brightest and loudest, the hopes for safety, for healing, for peace that echo across the borderlands. They reach out, as they do every night, granting what minor miracles they can to the rangers who keep Sembara safe from the darkness of the Plague Lands.

The work is easy tonight. As the moon turns to full the tidal pull of the Divine Presence grows stronger, filling the land, and the Source is easy to reach. The Fox thinks of days running in the forests of the north, and stretches across the world. The Hunter calls to him, reminds him of the task ahead, but remembers the joy of those early days too, the thrill and power of just running in the deep forests where he met the Fox.

Their attention, though, does not stay on the forested Mostreve hills on the southern reaches of Sembara, nor the arid foothills where the people of the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez scratch out a living on the edge of the Plague Lands. The full moon also draws the darkness of the Void closer. The Hunter, always with one small part of his essence watching those who carry echoes of his companions of old, sees the madness pour into the soul of a poor innocent boy, a young dwarf not even of age, in west of Dunmar.

(cont)


[9/23/2024 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
While the Fox tends to the prayers of the rangers of Sembara, the Hunter watches Dunmar more closely for a moment. Across the desert and dry arid plains -- so hard not to cast the land in his mind's eye as it was -- the People of the Horse are moving. Sura, the sister of the current Samraat, has returned from an unreachable prison, and many people are gathering in her camps. And yet she is not marching to war, not yet.

North of the city of Tokra, an old woman sits by the fire, wondering. The Hunter watches her a moment, sees the prayers streaming to Bhishma, asking when the strange travelers of her dreams will arrive, and how much should she tell them when they do? He senses the tangled future, but there is little he can do to shape that destiny.

In Tokra, the poor innocent is snarling, consumed with the madness of Jinnik on this night of power. The waves of the Void crash over him, each wave reaching higher and higher up the beach, threatening to overwhelm his soul, until suddenly there is calm, clear water and silver twilight in the forests. The Fox comes running -- is this my home? No, the Hunter says, just an echo of what was lost, but that echo still has power.

The tide madness recedes from the boy, but not from everywhere in this city. Elsewhere, the darkness of the Void is pulled tight, bound together with the souls of those who have submitted to its power. It will be harder to free these of the curse.


[9/24/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm mostly pretty busy with work today and tomorrow but I was playing around a bit more with DM notes and status tags, and I think we are still missing one categorization mechanism‚Ä¶


[9/24/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
Specifically there are a handful of pages that are about either big ‚Äúworld level‚Äù things (Mos Numena, Elves) or major regional level things (Chardonian Empire, Sembara, Tyrwingha)


[9/24/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
These pages are all characterized by the ability to have kinda endless spiraling detail (much of which isn‚Äôt relevant for a player facing webpage but is useful when making up new related things) and also a somewhat iterative approach to development and somewhat of a potential to be invented at some level even without a game reason


[9/24/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
They are also the pages where ‚Äúdone‚Äù is the hardest to define as at some level they are never done


[9/24/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there are several separate things here:

(1) There is: does the note in question contain enough accurate information for me to run a [session, arc, one-shot, mini-series, campaign] there and usefully leverage existing lore? Or separately to use it as background color? 
(2) There is: is another DM actively working in this area, such that I should discuss if I am actively running something involving this note? 
(3) There is: does this note capture all the information that has been invented about this thing?
(4) There is: does this note have a level of detail that is appropriate to its centrality in the world? That is, is this a place that would benefit from invention because it seems thin at the moment?


[9/24/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I think (1) is well-captured by status tags, primarily needswork but also active, update and dm_notes


[9/24/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) is captured by dm_plans


[9/24/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
(3) is generally captured by status/cleanup and perhaps status/metadata


[9/24/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not sure that (4) needs to be marked in any particular way?


[9/24/2024 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. the Sembara page is clearly not currently adequate to run a game in Sembara without relying on outside information, so it is correctly tagged status/needswork (probably should be more detail but I think there are both shared and external notes). but does it need a separate tag that says "this is world-relevant?"


[9/24/2024 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
So a good example is the Duchy of Maseau. 

The page right now is both (a) pretty thin and (b) not fully up to date some of the latest invention on Isingue and the hobgoblin wars. 

I have some background color that I‚Äôve tossed out in both my Aussons mini series and current game but nothing really meaningful or that I care about being particularly canonical


[9/24/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
And I currently don‚Äôt have any plans to send my PCs there but it‚Äôs kinda lurking on the border of my game always a couple of random moments of invention away from at least being semi-relevant


[9/24/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
So what‚Äôs the right status for the page?


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] .deciusmus
Or take sembara? What level of work is required to change from needswork to some other status tag? Is a 5-10 sentence summary (good enough for a game in Dunmar) enough?


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it needs work. it would be tough - possibly misleading - to try to do much invention there relying entirely on the details on the page itself, especially given more recent inventions in addermarch and southern sembara that directly impinge on Maseau


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I would tag it status/needswork (shared/external/nothing depending)


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
and also dm_notes: color and dm_plans: no


[9/24/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe status/needswork/internal if it is just about refactoring based on details of hobgoblin history

my mental test is "if I was going to run a low level one shot somewhere random in taelgar, do I feel like I could reasonably invent a small town and a nearby ruin that would not create contradictions"

personally I would keep Sembara as needswork until it reaches the level of detail of e.g. Dunmar which I think is a particularly complete note

but if you would prefer finer granularity then perhaps a distinction between "wrong/bad don't use" and "incomplete" is what you are looking for?

I also think addermarch is a good example - I basically invented everything I felt like I wanted to know to reliably be able to improvise history/ruins/towns in addermarch, and it is largely all in one place, the note in obsidian

Yes, I think that is most of it. I think there is a spiraling level of detail, i.e.

Good enough to toss out as color -> good enough to touch down for part of a session or be used as PC background -> good enough to run a few adventures -> good enough to run a campaign

so i agree it would be useful to have that kind of information embedded in each note but i'm not sure what the tagging system would be, especially what it would be that wouldn't add a large refactorization workload


[9/24/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but also isn't that kind of a judgement call that is hard to pin down?

that is, if we use status tags and DM notes to reliably track how much information exists about <thing x> that is not recorded on the <thing x> note, then if you are looking at a page that has no status tags or DM notes but is still not complete enough to run in, maybe you need to make some stuff up


[9/24/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i feel like the important point of status tags is to be able to see "how much stuff is invented about this place already but is missing from the note"


[9/24/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
(but this elides the "is the stuff here wrong or just incomplete")

What is the right status tag for Ardlas? There is basically nothing invented about it, although we had a couple of discussions about highlander kingdom vibes, and there is a bit of deep history in worldbuilding documents about Ardlas


[9/24/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
The other part of this for me at least is trying to reduce the # of items with status tags


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
So i.e. if I have a bit of time in the evening I might want to pick a few "status/needsworks" to clean up.


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
I was contemplating having something like a status/complex


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
for "world-level" pages


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
which would just be permanent


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
and then if I wanted to try to clean up some easy things you can do status/needswork and !status/complex


[9/24/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
the other thing I was contemplating was the idea of dm_plans gets fuzzy for big world level pages....

for example, take Mind Flayers. I don't have any immediate plans for mind flayers, but I know I eventually want to use them as a major villian


[9/24/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I think for Ardlas, looking at the note now, I think:

(1) the main page needs to capture - at least, or perhaps preferably, as a comment - the flavor of the discussion about vibes
(2) it would be useful to review the wordbuilding stuff and pull a few minor details about who lives there
(3) it should have a minimal description of geography and bounaries to the extent the lines on the map are correct
