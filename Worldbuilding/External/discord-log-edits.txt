That is from Ulrich Monastery that was published in an old Dragon magazine adventure, I just switched the l and the r

[11/4/2023 9:13 AM] rsulfuratus
looking at your Cleenseau doc - making me think I probably need to try to sketch out a definitive history of the Great War based on what I can remember / find of actual campaign history from the 90s, plus some retcons inventions as needed. a key question is did the hobgoblin army that sacked insigue (nee irebor) reach sembara, and if so how deep did they penetrate?


[11/4/2023 9:14 AM] .deciusmus
My dim recollection from high school was that Sembara was a "base of operations" that never was heavily invaded


[11/4/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that was my thinking as well - I seem to recall a race basically to kill cha'mutte before he could ~do something mysterious~ to knock out the sembaran army


[11/4/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
there was a war council and i have a bunch of notes somewhere with troop strengths basically for the southern sembaran army

[11/4/2023 9:20 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that is why you and cha'mutte were in urlich in the first place


[11/4/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
i think looking back at what notes I can easily the intetion was that cha'mutte created the plague to cut dunmar off from sembara, but then on his death is spread somewhat and destroyed the hobgoblin army that had sacked isingue and was threatened sembara's southern borders.


[11/4/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
there was also a whole thing about the lich king of Vasa (now Vostok) that seems like it should just mostly be tossed


[11/4/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
one other thing about hobgoblins - while I think in context it makes sense that they would have put the people of Cleenseau to death given the strategic location as a beachhead, I think of hobgoblins more as authoritarian dictators and slavers than just mindless brutality, and also having enough strategic foresight to balance a reputation for brutality. for example perhap they slaughter anyone who resists, but towns that surrender are taxed, and perhaps some are enslaved, but allowed to escape with relatively little death. and also I guess for hobgoblins taxes and enslavement might not be far off - maybe it is something like they believe that humans naturally owe hobgoblins the products of their labor, so when they govern a place they order people what to do and take what they need of the product. and there is no freedom of movement, or anything. but this isn't chattel slavery, particularly. and of course they recognize that people need food to live and productivity is lower if the population is starving/cold, so living under hobgoblin rule is usually grueling and unpleasant, but not particularly deadly as long as you follow the rules and do what you're told


[11/4/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
Right. One of the reasons I sent it to you is I don‚Äôt have a good sense of hobgoblins other than hobgoblins = fascists and orcs = crazed warmongers


[11/4/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
any thoughts on hobgoblins vs halflings?


[11/4/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
Meaning would hobgoblinsnhave any different attitudes towards@other non human races


[11/4/2023 9:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i think that might depend a bit on the group


[11/4/2023 9:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't have a clear sense


[11/4/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the central idea for hobgoblins is they have like the opposite of the divine spark, they see human/incorporeal gods as weak crutches and humans as less-than-sentient for relying on them


[11/4/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
so there is a reason for a particular antipathy to humans


[11/4/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
but of course cha'mutte had a big influence on many hobgoblins and that would probably lead them to lumping nonhumans together


[11/4/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
with humans


[11/4/2023 9:59 AM] .deciusmus
Right. I might tweak the Atavus period history a bit. Actually Atavus was explicitly not allied with Cha‚Äômutte, right?


[11/4/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
correct


[11/4/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe Atavus doesn‚Äôt sack the town at all and the halfling community especially has an uneasy truce with him.


[11/4/2023 10:01 AM] .deciusmus
That works to make the current Crossroads Inn a very old building that survived. Maybe it was a center of ‚ÄúUnderground Railroad‚Äù type activities where the halflings were secretly helping humans escape


[11/4/2023 10:02 AM] .deciusmus
Which is useful for my game as it would explain why there are ancient underground tunnels


[11/4/2023 10:02 AM] rsulfuratus
that definitely would work


[11/4/2023 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus
in my notes Revaka - the hobgoblin in the mirror who was trapped by Cha'mutte for refusing to join his armies - was the granddaughter of the court magician for Atavus


[11/4/2023 10:03 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/4/2023 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus
so Cha'mutte wasn't super-active during Domain of Atavus anyway, or at least was not active enough that he was punishing hobgoblins who didn't join his side


[11/4/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/4/2023 10:05 AM] rsulfuratus
but it would be quite interesting to make the hobgoblin survivors of the domain of atavus carry with them anti-cha'mutte attitudes (presumably hobgoblins were aware of him even that far back)


[11/4/2023 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
So basically you have:
- Atavus, wants to conquer, enslaved the town


[11/4/2023 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
Next relevant set of hobgoblins is the 2nd hobgoblin war, which is the more ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù shattered ice clan folks. They want land to live in more than anything


[11/4/2023 10:07 AM] .deciusmus
And so Cleenseau is fortified but never in real danger of distraction


[11/4/2023 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
But the 3rd hobgoblin war is caused by a new leader amongst the shattered ice hobgoblins who explicitly is seeking bad things for humans - more Naziesque as opposed to Mussolini, say


[11/4/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
And so when Cleenseau is sacked they put some larger percentage of the humans to death, but keep the buildings


[11/4/2023 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
in your hobgoblin war notes, you have the 3rd hobgoblin war started by sembara, but I actually think it makes more sense if it is started by a new hobgoblin leader


[11/4/2023 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus
DR 1644, summer: [[Charlotte II]] at the urging of her husband [[Lionel Falconhurst]], the grandson of the Duke of Maseau, and a prominent [[Isingue|Isinguen]], launches a rapid assault on the [[Shattered Ice Clan]], starting the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|Third Hobgoblin War]]


[11/4/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
Right. Maybe change that


[11/4/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
Or alternatively keep it half-way. The new hobgoblin leader is starting the war against maseau not sembara


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that could work too


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] .deciusmus
And sembara comes to their aid


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
either way I think a new hobgoblin leader with much more explicitly elliminationist aims is a useful component of the beginning of the 3rd war


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
which is also much more brutal on cleensau for that reason, which works for your history


[11/4/2023 10:12 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps something to do with the mad scientist hobgoblin politics as well‚Äî something that makes shattered ice less concerned with keeping Maseau as a buffer


[11/4/2023 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus
right this is all going to tie into the final tier 4 arc of the dunmari campaign somehow with beryl, the awakened monks, the isingue ooze, and the mad scientist hobgoblins


[11/4/2023 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus
so leave that blank for now, just "something changed"


[11/4/2023 10:13 AM] .deciusmus
And then when sembara comes into the war, and wins at first, the leader is enraged and decides to take on sembara as a first priority


[11/4/2023 10:14 AM] .deciusmus
So you have some degree of ‚Äúself inflicted‚Äù but also some degree of ‚Äúif not for sembara Maseau would probably be gone‚Äù


[11/4/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
right also sembaran army >> massau army, maybe the hope was sembara wouldn't risk another war and it was a bit of a surprise to the hobgoblins that they attacked, and they had to change their battle strategy quickly


[11/4/2023 10:15 AM] .deciusmus
Right. But the new somewhat crazy leader is a wizard or brilliant strategist or has access to a powerful artificat and so he wins and wins against sembara


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
i think for ~reasons~ sembara should never really know why he is winning so much


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
Actually magic could be key here‚Äî I have in my notes that the Tyrwinghan warlock army holds them back more successfully than the more mundane sembaran army


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
That works too


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
But I need some reason why Cece is so successful against him


[11/4/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, that could be vague as well I guess üòÄ


[11/4/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
let me look at the timeline a bit, i have a few ideas


[11/4/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
this is all in the 1640s right


[11/4/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
?


[11/4/2023 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/4/2023 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
If it works for you, how about: at some point in the war, Cece just starts winning battle after battle. The hobgoblins fight just as hard, and their tactics are sound, but they keep catching unlucky breaks, and stop catching lucky breaks. So for example maybe in the first battle a convenient lingering fog let‚Äôs the hobgoblins hide their calvary, but in the same circumstances later in the war the fog would blow away and clear two hours too early leaving them exposed


[11/4/2023 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
Just pushed a minor update to clarifiy the above, i.e. that the war started against Maseau in 1644 and then after some early Sembaran successes, the Shattered Ice Clan changed direction to fight against the Sembarans


[11/4/2023 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
The sembarans of course attribute this to divine favor, with maybe a little bit of ‚Äúethlenn is helping‚Äù


[11/4/2023 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
But really no one knows for sure


[11/4/2023 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
What I have established but what doesn't have to be canon is that the hobgoblins rapidly push north, and each summer another set of fortifications falls, in 1645, 1646, and 1647. Then in the winter 1647-1648 the old queen (Charlotte II) is killed in an ambush when visiting troops and Cece is crowned


[11/4/2023 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
I'm agnostic as to whether Cece has a few early stalemates, but the flavor I have written is that in the summer campaign seaso nof 1648 she just starts winning, and winning


[11/4/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
It works perfectly with the history for it to be seen in Sembara as just divine favor. I could even make Cece explicitly thought to the blessed by the Mother or something. She could plausibly have divine magic to some extent even


[11/4/2023 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
I would say she has a few statements in spring that are basically forgotten about now, and then in the summer begins a winning streak driven by exceptional bad luck on the part of the hobgoblin armies, and assumed in sembara to be cece‚Äôs divine blessing


[11/4/2023 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
Works perfectly


[11/4/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
The other bit I have is that the Tyrwinghan army, in alliance with the Earl of Addermarch, is much more successful at holding the line against the hobgoblins than Sembara. This could very plauisbily just be because the hobgoblin leader sees it as their mission to kill the sembarans specifically to punish them in meddling with his war against Maseau


[11/4/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
But there could also be a fey/warlock side


[11/4/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
I can leave it undefined


[11/4/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I think that‚Äôs fine, combination of factors can make that work.


[11/4/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
Here's what I'm adding:

Enst Campaign
---
DR: 1648
tags: [event-source]
---
A series of battles between [[Sembara]] and the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] that pushed the hobgoblins south of the [[Enst]]. Characterized by exceptionally bad luck on the part of the hobgoblins, which is attributed in Sembara to Cece's personal connection to the [[The Father]]


[11/4/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
DR 1648, late winter: Charlotte II is [[The Ambush of Charlotte II|killed by hobgoblins]] while travelling to inspect the [[Army of the South]] camped outside [[Wisford]]
* DR 1648, late winter: Cece I crowned Queen
* DR 1648, early spring: The [[Army of the North]] attempts to break the [[Siege of Dunfry (Third Hobgoblin War)|siege of Dunfry]], and is bogged down
* DR 1648, late spring: Cece I combines the Armies of the South, and Mostreve, and raises a special levy across the realm, and forms the [[Radiant Alliance]], which she takes personal command of
* DR 1648, early summer: After a few stalemates, the [[Radiant Alliance]] breaks the siege of  Dunfry and the Armies of the North and West join with the Radiant Alliance
* DR 1648, summer:  [[The Enst Campaign]] pushes the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] west of [[Barony of Vaubonne|Vaubonne]] and south of the [[Enst]]


[11/4/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that is great


[11/4/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
Even the name works for Semabara to treat this as divine favor


[11/4/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus

Would it be implausible for Avatus to have constructed a permanent dimension door that would teleport people from the old Drankorian fort on the south bank of the Enst to a small underground fortification on the north bank?


[11/4/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
That could still exist, perhaps?


[11/4/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
That seems totally plausible. His court wizard made the mirror of soul trapping after all


[11/4/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
True


[11/4/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
Mostly just looking for ways to expand the dungeon üòÑ


[11/4/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
But I'm thinking that's how he broke the Sembaran line. Although Sembara was a bit disorganized at the time, holding the line of the Enst would have been important, and crossing the fortified bridge relatively hard. Avatus sent a crack team of hobgoblin adventures across the river under the cover of invisibility/etc and then constructed -- a little bit away from the main town -- a small underground area, with a dimension door back to the south bank where Avatus had taken over the old drankroian fort. From the underground base, the hobgoblins constructed various ways to attack behind the lines, thus defeating the army in a surprise midnight attack


[11/4/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
which today, plays out as some mostly ruined tunnel from under the town leading to a large underground staging area with a portal back to the lair of Avatus, which is mostly ruined, but might still have a few weird things hanging around

[11/5/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking more about elven society, trying to get a vision of orenlas. here is kind of my framework, but interested in your perspective if anything seems "un-elvish" to you.


[11/5/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
1. synthesizing the email discussion about material abundance, intellectual property, what elves see as wealth, etc. 

the basic framework is that elves are capable, via magic, of growing nearly anything, but this is not necessarily simple or easy in all cases. growing enough food and providing simple clothes, space to live, basic necessities, for all elves is the first priority, and except when under attack or otherwise disrupted from the normal balance of things, this is always possible and a fundamental aspect of elven civilization. there is no poverty in elven cities

that said, this does not mean there are no differences in wealth. while elves find no reason to accumulate coin or gems in their raw form, they do value new things that are brought into the world, whether ideas/songs/stories/poems or physical things of beauty, or of practical value (although I think elven culture would usually tend towards beauty). building on the idea from the sisila tree fruit backstory from Delwath, one thing that determines wealth is that it is a privilege to be allowed to use rare materials. so you can't buy sisila fruit with money, but if you are recognized as a talented chef you are given one to bake with. 

exactly how this kind of resource allocation is managed in elven society can be handwaved a bit, but the key vibes aspect is that there are wealthy/non-wealthy elves in some sense, but wealth is measured in what you create. so a "poor" jeweler may often work with plain metals, and a "rich" jeweler may have the opportunity to craft in mithril. but there is also a "how far have your creations spread" aspect, and this is how you "get rich" - a "poor" jeweler who produces amazing designs in bronze and copper may get asked to make something with gold or mithral. 

this ties in to intellectual property too, as derivative work is less valued that new work


[11/5/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the details of this are a bit unnecessary to really know, but the implications in game would be:
1. elves would sometimes trade for material goods, as material abundance does not necessarily mean lack of scarcity entirely - but they wouldn't *need* to do it
2. you still have a kind of status hierarchy based around perceived value of the new things you bring into the world. as a side note, this sets up a bit of dichotomy where "creators" are higher status than "doers". So Delwath, as a solider and quartermaster, would not necessarily be seen as a high status elf (although perhaps this is also a consequence of the great war - in the absence of war perhaps he would have been an amazing chef). i'm not sure this is exactly right, so maybe there is kind of a second, orthogonal hierarchy that is more oriented around caretaker roles, so you can be high status because you are a skilled commander or a talented wizard and not necessarily need to create something new
3. elven cities would feel weird to other races - there aren't markets in the usual sense, people aren't really buying food. there would be trees with fruit just kind of there, for example. maybe there would be occasional art shows, and lots of songs and storytelling, and things like that that would have subtle undercurrents of competition noticeably primarily to other elves


[11/5/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
2. on governance and society

the basic idea here I think is a bit more established, around the nurturer/caretaker distinction, the unifiers and the "trial of unity" idea, and the idea of each ka as kind of a collective unit that figures out how to reach consensus on their own

the game implications are, I think:
1. you can't go to an elven city and say "take me to your leader" - there is no galadriel or elrond to speak to. however, I think that most elven settlements would have some people who are the outerward face of the community to visitors. perhaps with explicit titles like "Caretaker So-and-So". 
2. if you are asking something of "elves" it should be a little unclear how decisions are made, although there is an opportunity to create a way to participate in a "trial by unity" if desired
3. there should probably not be a lot of internal, obvious factions in elvish society, except during times of debate and consensus-finding, and then those factions would be temporary. this is probably not a universal rule - decision points have to start somewhere and may start with a factional period. but once it is resolved, it is resolved.

adding this to worldbuilding/brainstorming as well


[11/5/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
I like all this


[11/5/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
A few other thoughts ‚Äî I think a lot of this ‚Äî especially the creator stuff ‚Äî would move on scales that make it hard for humans to observe. There is probably rarely a rush and a lot of time spent contemplating and so on


[11/5/2023 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
So for example an elven poetry recital might seem odd to a human in a couple of ways‚Äî it might take a couple of days rather than a night, and reactions might be considered and take a week or two or more to come out


[11/5/2023 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure.. thinking a bit


[11/5/2023 6:59 PM] .deciusmus
So‚Ä¶ forget the above. I think it isn‚Äôt interesting. I think you have it about right, but I‚Äôd make one tweak.


[11/5/2023 7:08 PM] .deciusmus
Basically here‚Äôs my view of the PCs arriving in an elf city and attending a banquet.  

Unlike in a human city, where the banquet would be put on by some lord/baron/whatever, in the elven city it is probably put on by someone the community values highly. A creator of some sort. 

Maybe in this case a famous chef is throwing a banquet to celebrate a rare nectar that is aged for 3 ka and is being unveiled. 

Who attends? It isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúrich‚Äù as that isn‚Äôt entirely meaningful. Perhaps the chef invites a poet, who has agreed to present a new poem in the chef‚Äôs honor. A jewel smith is also in attendance in exchange for a delicate ring, which is presented as a gift to the chef before the meal (so everyone can admire the jewel smith). Of course some of the chefs friends are there as well, perhaps without any particular gifts.


[11/5/2023 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
But I‚Äôm not sure it would feel like a status competition exactly


[11/5/2023 7:10 PM] .deciusmus
How did the chef get the rare nectar to begin with? Probably via a consensus process more than anything else. The rare materials go to those who can make the best use of them


[11/5/2023 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
Or rather can create the best thing with them


[11/5/2023 7:12 PM] .deciusmus
And of course, plenty of elves are ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt have any great talents - and would rarely if ever attend such fancy banquets


[11/5/2023 7:14 PM] .deciusmus
But I think an outsider would see it all as glittering and amazing and impressive - an ‚Äúfancy‚Äù elven banquet would be filled with the best creators


[11/5/2023 7:21 PM] .deciusmus
As far as status, it‚Äôs perfectly normal for government agents or even generals to be middling rather than high status‚Ä¶ and given there is no low status or poverty why would a commander necessarily be high status?


[11/5/2023 7:22 PM] .deciusmus
Now, gratitude is a real thing and a famous solider who was known to say have saved a bunch of elves would certainly have an ‚Äúin‚Äù


[11/5/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
right, this is what I was getting at with "orthogonal hierarchy"


[11/5/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't the same as being rich, in a sense, but there are many ways to being respected


[11/5/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I just don‚Äôt think elven society is particularly status conscious


[11/5/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
true


[11/5/2023 7:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but in your banquet example, perhaps the famous solider is also there - not because they are necessarily friends with the chef, or have anything valuable to present to demonstrate their creative prowess, but simply as a gesture of gratitude and acknowledgement


[11/5/2023 7:26 PM] .deciusmus
I do think there are glittering banquets and famous painters who having a portrait from them is something a bunch of elves want. But then other elves maybe are more interested in listening to Aldanors roots and spend years ‚Äúnot doing much‚Äù as far as humans would see it


[11/5/2023 7:26 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense


[11/5/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
I do think the more material focused elves who be the ones ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù see more. It‚Äôs easier to observe the unveiling of a famous painting or a jeweler presenting an orate set of earrings


[11/5/2023 7:27 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/5/2023 7:30 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway I think your vibe is basically right, the main comment I really had is that I‚Äôm not sure elves are particularly obsessed with status. So I think the poetry reading would be more about being good and honoring the material and bringing something new into the world, and less about one-upping another elf


[11/5/2023 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that makes sens


[11/5/2023 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
*sense


[11/5/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
Of course if a famous goldsmith was in attendance and one of the poets particularly wanted a new set of golden candlesticks, then the poet might be trying to impress the goldsmith


[11/5/2023 7:32 PM] .deciusmus
And an aspiring goldsmith needs to impress the community to be seen as ‚Äúworthy‚Äù of working in a scare resource (gold)


[11/5/2023 7:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess one thing to think about is who is collecting all this art - some of it is maybe made for the artist, or for the community, but is any art collected? is it only by other artists?


[11/5/2023 7:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess this is in part what I was thinking about w/r/t other hierarchies of status - does a famous diplomat or solider or other kind of hero/adventurer come home and end up with wealth in the form of gifts?


[11/5/2023 7:36 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, probably.


[11/5/2023 7:37 PM] .deciusmus
And I think even a ‚Äúmiddle-class‚Äù elf would have some art. After all, to gain a name for yourself you‚Äôd want to give away some works


[11/5/2023 7:40 PM] .deciusmus
And also, beauty is I think important to elven culture


[11/5/2023 7:41 PM] .deciusmus
But also it isn‚Äôt obvious they would want it. Maybe gardens are their thing not art. Or song, and they are honored by having some songs dedicated to them


[11/5/2023 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, of course


[11/5/2023 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
on a separate topic, looking at the timing of leya and mela, I think it probably needs to be the case that these aren


[11/5/2023 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
*aren't hard and fast dates, but rather have some flexibility


[11/5/2023 7:43 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., right now the leya of the 36th ka starts in 1547, two years after the great war begins


[11/5/2023 7:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but it makes a lot more sense for that generation to have been "rushed" and underwent the Rite of Awakened 10 years early


[11/5/2023 7:44 PM] .deciusmus
Right, well, ultimately it‚Äôs literally something Aldanor and Elmerca are doing


[11/5/2023 7:45 PM] .deciusmus
So they could have changed the timing


[11/5/2023 7:47 PM] .deciusmus
But I don‚Äôt think elves themselves can change it. Although I think the leya isn‚Äôt actually physiologically as important as the mela.


[11/5/2023 7:47 PM] rsulfuratus
the way I've been thinking about it in sketching out history is the following:
1. the mela starts every 160 years, like clockwork. the rooting of aldanor grows stronger in the few years before the mela begins, and by the beginning of the mela elves are feeling the pull of Aldanor's roots and their connection to Taelgar. sometimes this lasts 10 years, sometimes 20.
2. elven childhood, the time of dreaming, is usually 50 years, but sometimes it is 35, and sometimes 60. the leya is traditionally marked as when the first elven children begin to experience the Rite of Awakening
3. the first few years of the leya often have a gradual pace of awakening, but sometimes everyone awakens all at once. Elmerca, who controls prophecy and foresight, also controls the timing of the leya and can shift the dreams of the sleepers as needed


[11/5/2023 7:48 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I like that


[11/5/2023 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
the advantage of this is for worldbuilding is that we don't have to constantly adjust the dates of each ka, which are counted from the start of the mela, but have flexibilty for the role of the elves in the world by shifting the leya


[11/5/2023 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
so the leya dates in the cycle of generations doc could be shifted by 15 years or so in either direction, but the mela dates shouldn't change


[11/5/2023 7:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right. That makes sense. I also think each individual elf has a different length of time in the dreaming. Because kids are born over say a 15-20 year span, but the awakening is more of a 2-3 year span


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
The older kids just spend longer in the dreaming.


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
Elves probably find the idea of counting age a bit odd anyway. It would be meaningless to Delwath to say he is 263 years old or whatever.


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
(Which I think kind fits how I‚Äôve been playing him anyway)


[11/5/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
putting aside strangeness with the shadow realm, I think delwath would say he is in his 2nd leya


[11/5/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
if anyone pressed him on his age


[11/5/2023 7:52 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, or he‚Äôd translate from human years from the start of the ka in which he was born


[11/5/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/5/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
(which is 1467 - for the 36th ka. but I just changed the start of the 36th leya to 1532)


[11/5/2023 7:53 PM] .deciusmus
But actually Delwath never experienced a mela. This return to Orenlas would be his first time returning to an elven place since he left for war in the 1532


[11/5/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/5/2023 8:01 PM] rsulfuratus
when does aurbez become a thing? and have you given any thought to the role of e.g. the rangers in the hobgoblin wars?


[11/5/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
I have not really thought much about the rangers. I keep kind of forgetting about them


[11/5/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
Although I have a few things in the Sembara notes where they show up


[11/5/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think they suffer somewhat in the end of the Great War, a lot of them die. I really liked what we came up with the other day around them being originally Insinguen


[11/5/2023 8:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think of them as really directly connected to Sembaran history


[11/5/2023 8:04 PM] .deciusmus
So I think they are mostly active in Maseau / Addermarch / Tyrwingha


[11/5/2023 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[11/5/2023 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
they are really more about the plaguelands than anything else


[11/5/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/5/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
As far as Aurbez, my Ausson's Crossing mini-series was set in 1688, and Aurbez was a not-yet-realized idea


[11/5/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
But I don't know if that has to be canonical


[11/5/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is good, I think before the victories in the 3rd hobgoblin war it would have been challenging to have much settlement in aurbez


[11/5/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
some outlanders scratching out a living, that kind of thing, but not really even villages


[11/5/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I had the 1688 vibe be "very new frontier"


[11/5/2023 8:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I think people would have started moving there during the Peace of Cece, that is what marks, roughly, the "end' of the southern hobgoblin threat. (except the mad scientists)


[11/5/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but that's basically 1650. I am not sure when say, the road was built


[11/5/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
And it is possible also that south of Maseau was actually safer in the early 1600s


[11/5/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
Than north of Maseau I mean


[11/5/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/5/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
So you could actually have the initial "population boom" (still small, but) happen in the 1590s - 1610s as people flee south from the Shattered Ice Clan


[11/5/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure the details matter exactly right now, just trying to get a rough picture of what an elf who fought at the Battle of Urlich Monastery but then didn't return home for the next mela (in 1627) would have been doing if they basically hung around as a solider in the west/southern marches of sembara from 1545-1700 or so


[11/5/2023 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
the rangers are an obvious place for a lone elf solider, but not sure exactly what they would have been doing after the bloodlust wars, the blood plague, and all the chaos of the 1550s


[11/5/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
I'd say they would have ended up in Maseau and then the rangers.


[11/5/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
There is a ton of stuff in the Chronicle of Sembaran histor that isn't in the timeline yet

{Reactions}
üëç

[11/5/2023 8:15 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe the rangers as beryl knew them don't really survive the blood years intact - they were invovled in dealing with the blood plague, for example


[11/5/2023 8:15 PM] rsulfuratus
a few people who remember the sacred springs of isingue or whatever keep the knowledge alive


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
Although actually the main bit that would be relevant was the magic going wrong around the 1580s


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
at the end of the doc


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that too


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
I think a core of relatively powerful rangers escaped Isingue and the plagues and death likely with Beryl's help, and established themselves in Maseau in the 1546


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
and then rebuilt the organization, which was otherwise basically gone


[11/5/2023 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I guess the key thing is the continuity of knowledge going back to isingue about the sacred waters and such


[11/5/2023 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I think there should be something there, although it could be knowledge kept relatively secret


[11/5/2023 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
As far as your elf, the 1550s - 1602 has lots going on. I haven't written a history of Maseau, but they were a key part of the hobgoblin wars as well and were somewhat abandoned/cut off from Sembara and forced to stand on their own. Very much the kind of place that a elf might have been a key figure in


[11/5/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
Then in the early 1600s Sembara makes peace with the Shattered Ice Clan. But the 2nd Hobgoblin War, I think, was one where the hobgoblins explicitly wanted Maseau as a buffer


[11/5/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I'll look at the actual doc, I was just looking at the timeline. I know we shifted some dates around for the timeline but should be easy to recalibrate


[11/5/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
the more interested bit is after 1650


[11/5/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think by 1650, Maseau is pretty peaceful. The border has moved south and west


[11/5/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
But the stretch of lands between Maseau and Cleenseau is still relatively wild, and a solo elf might have gotten into various adventures there. Or they could have gone south towards Aurbez, which I think is where a lot of the rangers started going. The Ardonne river is choked with ash. Why? Etc.


[11/5/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
Adderfell is also a good possibility, in the post 1650 period


[11/5/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
The timeline in Chronicle doc is not aligned with the timeline in Timeline btw


[11/5/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
wasn't beryl a pretty good painter?


[11/5/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
next sesion is going to kind of be the Mike show


[11/5/2023 8:35 PM] .deciusmus
yes, he was


[11/5/2023 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
you might have to describe one of his paintings next session fyi


[11/5/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
ok üôÇ


[11/5/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
btw, I was wondering if we should retcon the Urlich to be a pass not a monastery, or at least make the monastery secret/mystical rather than something people talk about


[11/5/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
(maybe it was always secret?)


[11/5/2023 8:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean it was lifted straight out of a dungeon magazine adventure, which I think we played, and then I just reused the location for the final battle


[11/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't remember much lore about why there was a monastery in a pass or whether the monasety was secret or not


[11/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but very easily could just be ulrich pass


[11/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
oh maybe there was some connection to the dwarven firstborn and the underground adventure to the proto-heart of the mountain?


[11/5/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
that would imply secret


[11/5/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
I think Ulrich Pass should be what people talk about, that's where the huge battle was. The "monastery" was obviously a real place of some sort (the final battle is one of the few things I remember really clearly from the high school game) but I think it should be a bit secret and maybe not really a monastry. If I recall it was some mystical place where the firstborn were more connected to taelgar or something


[11/5/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i am happy with urlich pass, and the Battle of Urlich Pass as the final battle of the Great War


[11/5/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
the monastery could just be an extraplanar weak point to the divine realm, historically protected by the dwarves or something like that. it is destroyed now anyway so the history isn't super important


[11/5/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
Although remember there was also a big battle at High Horn


[11/5/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't remember High Horn at all


[11/5/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't really remember it until I started digging through high school stuff on one drive


[11/5/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
I think one of your players in an abortive taelgar campaign you started in college was from there or something?


[11/5/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/5/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
But also, I think the big battle was not actually at Ulrich, although retconning it to be there is fine. I think we went south from the big battle to have the secondary mystical battle at the monastery


[11/5/2023 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess i think people would have seen the massive magical battle against the giant shadow dragon


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
it could be the Battle of High Horn and the Battle of Urlich Pass are considered two separate events


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, it is more satisfying to have had it taking place in the sky above the huge battle


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
with the Battle of Urlich Pass being you all gainst Cha'mutte


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
High Horn doesn't really exist anywyay


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
It would I guess by somewhere in Ardlas or so


[11/5/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
But that's currently envisioned as a place where there are no passes over the mountains, instead humans traded with dwarves who traded with humans on the other side


[11/5/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I see it on the map


[11/5/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
let's just retcon it away

[11/5/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
Although it would suit the narrative history of Sembara if the highland kingdoms felt like the fought a thankless and costly unacknowledged war


[11/5/2023 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
that could also work - it isn't really acknowledged as the key battle of the war


[11/5/2023 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
The Sembaran armies massed at Ulrich Pass to stop the "main advance" of the hobgoblins from the west, and were the heroes who stood in the shadows of the actual heroes, and it becomes this whole myth-making thing


[11/5/2023 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
Well all this time, the highland kingdoms bled with the dwarves in the north, with no real support, and if they hadn't been there the Sembaran armies wouldn't have had a home to come back to


[11/5/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
Which actually works well with both the notes I have from highschool (that Sembaran "north armies" were weaker and less well supported) and the latter history


[11/5/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
When the hobgoblins attack Ardlas in the 1560s and Sembara still doesn't send aid, its the last straw, and causes these diplomatic breaks.


[11/6/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
Can't stay away from messing around with Obsidian instead of doing work... üôÇ

I have a question on the map. I found an Obsidian leaflet plugin and it works really well to show the taelgar map (which I grabbed for now from https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarmap/)


[11/6/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
What did you do to set up the coordinate system though so that Lat/Long is correct and so that distances are correct?

I have been actually working all day üòù

The coordinate system is a huge mess - you can look at the taelgar map repo


[11/6/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
I got it working


[11/6/2023 4:58 PM] rsulfuratus
The thing I‚Äôve been thinking about is moving away from the current static site generator to something a little more flexible.


[11/6/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
We are currently working on rebuilding our website for my group so I spent a lot of today browsing themes - the taelgar verse is kind of ugly compared to what‚Äôs out there


[11/6/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
The obsidian leaflet stuff is very cool but I‚Äôm not sure how easy it would be to push to web


[11/6/2023 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I‚Äôd love to be able to sync the leaflet taelgar map with the taelgar verse

I'm not sure what ssg means here


[11/6/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
static site generator


[11/6/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
something that converts md to html


[11/6/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
very popular in academic world

[11/6/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
for example, autobuilds website from md docs embedded in github repo


[11/6/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So I was going to say there are 2 architectures for an obsidian export --

1. A ssg that parses markdown to generate a site
2. An obsidian plugin that exports the obsidian rendered view (which is HTML, after all)

[11/6/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
The problem with any SSG in this scenario is that inevitably it won't be able to handle codeblocks very well


[11/6/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
Or, more specifically, to handle a code block it will increasingly need to reimplement stuff


[11/6/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
There are kinda hacky fixes in most cases, i.e. the stuff we already did with dataview special casing


[11/6/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is another option


[11/6/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess could imagine a workflow like: private vault -> public vault -> website or something


[11/6/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, if my day job was writing typescript I'd be tempted to just fork obsidian-webpage-export and change it to only export files linked from a root page


[11/6/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
I was messing around with it a little bit, it already exports dataview perfectly


[11/6/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't just the things not linked, it is things like dataview commands that pull up both secret and public files


[11/6/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
need to rerender the dataview in a vault that doesn't have the secret files


[11/6/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
Right, dataview with secrets doesn't work


[11/6/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Actually private -> export -> plugin to do the export is a much stronger workflow than anything else, as it allows various plugins to work


[11/6/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. private vault to export vault


[11/6/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
you could practically do it with the existing obsidian-webage-export, if the idea was say:
1. Run a python script or whatever that created the "to export" value. This would include only files from the linked node and strip the %%^Campaign blocks and such, but wouldn't render dataview blocks


[11/6/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
2. Trigger an export from the export value


[11/6/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
does the obsidian-webpage-export work with leaflet?


[11/6/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
not quite


[11/6/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't include the JS


[11/6/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but it does work with dataviewjs?


[11/6/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/6/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
So the leaflet exports correctly but because the leaflet JS isn't included, you can't scroll or interact with the map


[11/6/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus

[11/6/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
so you get something like the above, where clicking the icons doesn't do anything, and you can't + or - the map to change sizes


[11/6/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
whereas the dataview stuff works fine, because the dataview generates a static html page, and doesn't depend on loaded JS to work


[11/6/2023 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
so the options are basically:
a) run custom/specialized code to go from  obsidian vault -> clean md, and then use the massive set of tools available to build nice websites from clean md to generate the taelgarverse website
b) use custom code to sanitize the obsidian vault, then use specialized code to export the vault to html


[11/6/2023 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
the advantage of (b) is obviously that it is easy to build a lot of stuff in obsidian with dataview and similar tools that will get seemlessly exported


[11/6/2023 5:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the disadvantage of (b) is that you are kind of stuck relying on whoever is developing the obsidian html export


[11/6/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, on (b), that is only because neither of us really wants to learn typescript


[11/6/2023 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
syncing a plugin, i.e. by just having a custom "taelgar-html-export" that is un-git-ignored would be very easy


[11/6/2023 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
I think the real disadvantage of (b) is that it is very tightly coupled to Obsidian itself


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
and for example, if Obsidian wanted to try to push monetization of their own Publish flow, it could all fall apart


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that too


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Or if they are not careful about breaking changes. I'm looking at the export code and it is pretty deeply tied to the HTML structure that the obsidian rendering engine produces


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
in general it is just more brittle


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Well, the brittleness is different


[11/6/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
The clean MD architecture is very brittle when using any code block or similar feature in Obsidian


[11/6/2023 5:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right, in the past we haven't used a ton of code blocks but with the events/timelines I can see those being really useful


[11/6/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
Or with leaflets, say


[11/6/2023 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right, but leaflets is actually where i was thinking that clean md + a ssg would be better. it would require a bit more tweaking but seems much more likely to a) consistently work, and b) be easy to use/look nice. 

e.g., do you know if you can use tiles with obsidian? for local browsing the 25 Mb map is fine but for web browsing it is noticably slow


[11/6/2023 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
You can use tiles but you need a server for that


[11/6/2023 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
theoretically is should be possible to tile any raster image and serve it from localhost


[11/6/2023 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah but obsidian-leaflets doesn't do that


[11/6/2023 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[11/6/2023 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, obsidian leaflet has an image mode or a tile mode, and it only supports local images via image mode


[11/6/2023 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
Dataview is really the main problem


[11/6/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Because of its complexity


[11/6/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
ALthough any highly complex plugin is complicated. For example, obsidian leaflet generates markers from location: tags in your vault


[11/6/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
No idea how easy it would be replicate that in something else


[11/6/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
some of that is fairly straightforward - e.g. the plugin i linked to above can do exactly that


[11/6/2023 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
Then again, something like Jekyll already works with YAML frontmatter so it should work trivially


[11/6/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
generally speaking I think that the real question is whether the website turns into a separate project for fiddling around with or not


[11/6/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
right now it basically is just what it is; with the obsdian website export it would be the same


[11/6/2023 6:09 PM] rsulfuratus
in both cases there is a small bit of python cleanup, but generally there would never be a lot of fiddling around with the website as a website


[11/6/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
Mermaid is another plugin I've used in a few places


[11/6/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
But it also has a jekyll equivalent


[11/6/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm. so looking at obsidianhtml, which we currently use (and is now no longer being developed, so probably worth moving on)


[11/6/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
it basically uses a github-secrets-like workflow to handle things like dataview


[11/6/2023 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
which doesn't work perfectly, but might something to think about


[11/6/2023 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to eat dinner... the complexity with dataview is related to executing the javascript


[11/6/2023 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I need to start cooking


[11/6/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea is you run obsidian website export to generate html


[11/6/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
then you cut out the dataview bits and replace them with the generated html


[11/6/2023 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
for the obisidian -> clean markdown, this could be useful

[11/6/2023 6:53 PM] rsulfuratus
*then


[11/7/2023 10:41 PM] .deciusmus
Two things as I was mucking around for a few minutes with maps + Javascript.

1. On maps, I really like having a map in Obsidian as it helps the worldbuilding a lot to be able to easily reference stuff. Do you have (a) a better map than the one on taelgar verse with (b) layers for political borders or climate? The obsidian leaflet does layers, so if you had a chance to export/push a set of PNGs I might play around


[11/7/2023 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
2. On whereabouts, I was thinking of simplifying the code generation a little bit, not totally sure the details, but basically trying to simplify a bit for two "common" cases
* Just a home or just an origin, or a home + origin with no dates
* a single excursion line, for NPCs where they are "currently" somewhere, but their home/origin are not clear


[11/8/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
re: maps, yes I have a rather fancy Photoshop map with layers for climate, many kinds of borders, etc. it is in need of some updating and haven't had a chance to do this, but perhaps will on Friday (which I have off)


[11/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
re: whereabouts, yes, simplification is good. i think for tracking complex npcs who travel a lot whereabouts is pretty clunky


[11/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
what is really useful is a way to basically tag "is the place where the PCs met the NPC their home or just a place they were traveling through"


[11/8/2023 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
and separately, it is useful to track "was the person originally from the place where they were met"


[11/8/2023 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
btw if you are messing around, would be nice to get get_EventsTable to parse DR-end as well as DR, maybe automatically generate a "X ends" event


[11/8/2023 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
I just got off talking for 5 hours straight of various meetings, so giving myself a little break from work to recover.  I've been meaning to add a DR_end to generate an end date for sure. Not sure about for inline, would you want something like:

* (DR:: 1701) - (DR_end:: 1702): Something something

Probably, right?


[11/8/2023 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
it works better for events files


[11/8/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I would probably mostly use it for events files


[11/8/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
in lists I'm more likely to do: 
- (DR:: 1701): Thing starts
- (DR:: 1703): Thing ends


[11/8/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i've been using DR-end, e.g. in Blood Years, for event files that span multiple years


[11/8/2023 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
For whereabouts, my thinking is that the the key goal of whereabouts is to indicate the difference between 3 things:
* Were an NPC was from if it is different from where they live
* Where an NPC lives
* Where an NPC was when the party met them if it is different from where they live

{Reactions}
üëç

[11/8/2023 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yes agreed


[11/8/2023 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
Less often, it could be used to track shared NPCs who move, i.e. someone like Vistra who might have lived in place X for years A-B and then place Y for years C-D. Simarly, there are some NPCs (i.e. Kaeso) who move during a campaign, and it can be useful to track that via whereabouts change


[11/8/2023 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, i think the flexibility to account for individuals with multiple homes or multiple excursions is useful, but ideally the structure is set up to make that an optional add on not the main purpose


[11/8/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably NOT useful to use it to track goings and comings. i.e. if you had an NPC who is wandering across Dunmar (i.e. Sura) it is much more likely that you'd want do something like:

- date: 1748-01-29, type: excursion, place: traveling , region: Dunmar

Then to bother creating sequential records for each place they go


[11/8/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
If you wanted to track a detailed timeline of moves, you'd create a bulleted list instead


[11/8/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, agreed


[11/8/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
that said there are a few circumstances where i'd want sequential excursions. e.g., Antonia would be something like:
- date: xxxx, type: home, place: Chardon
- date: xxxx, type: excurision, place: traveling


[11/8/2023 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
- date: xxx, type: excursion (or home?), place: Mirror of Soul trapping


[11/8/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think that is better as a new home line


[11/8/2023 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
Well, maybe not


[11/8/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think the key thing is that usually you want to define where the character is traveling or "settled somewhere"


[11/8/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
and for the settled somewhere, you want to know whether is their origin/home/temporary place


[11/8/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
but you dont want to track in whereabouts **where** someone is travelling


[11/8/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, exactly


[11/8/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
so maybe type: excursion isn't actually correct


[11/8/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking about this differently, i wonder if having origin as part of whereabouts is actually not that useful?


[11/8/2023 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
Probably not. Origin maybe should just be a  frontmatter field


[11/8/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
i think whereabouts should basically just be a "settled at x at y time"; "traveling in x1 at y1 time"; "settled at x2 at y2 time"


[11/8/2023 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
(or based in instead of settled at, or whatever"


[11/8/2023 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
basic idea would be that if party meets a random traveler on the road, you can just add "traveling in x at y"


[11/8/2023 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking of it as:

* moved to X at time Y
* stopped in X at time Y until optional time Z
* was travelling from time X to optional time Z


[11/8/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
what is difference in moved to and stopped in though?


[11/8/2023 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
so for someone like Kadmos, you could say:
* origin chardon
* whereabouts:
** was traveling from time x


[11/8/2023 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
The output


[11/8/2023 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
So the idea is that 
stopped at is to capture the idea that someone was at a particular place at a particular time
travelling doesn't have a place. It just means they were away from home


[11/8/2023 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[11/8/2023 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
So the output text would for someone complicated would be something like:

Origin: <origin>
Based in: <home>
Current location: <traveling> or <stopped> place
Last seen by party: <stopped place> or <home>


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
It works best if we are relatively strict about saying if you are setting a last-seen-by-party date, you should also set a stopped
And perhaps the default for a "Stopped nested inside traveling" would be 1 day


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
is there a reason you'd ever care about a stopping place that wasn't also a "crossed paths with party" place?


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
In the simple case of I'm making up an NPC who is passing through but I don't know if the party is going to meet them and I don't want to decide where they are front


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
ah


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
okay


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
You would have ONLY  a stopped place for the place they are,perhaps without even a date


[11/8/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
it would just render as

Current location: <stopped>


[11/8/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
with no based in or home


[11/8/2023 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I only ever make up full yaml information for people that you actually meet (or hear about), the notes I have for people that you remain unaware of just get recycled into my draft NPCs folder to be reused


[11/8/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think it is generically cleaner to track stopped locations (which can be multiple) and last seen locations (when needed, always just 1)


[11/8/2023 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
So the idea would be:

**Simple NPC who lives somewhere, no separate origin, no travel**
Set origin to someplace, no whereabouts
Renders as
Based in: xxx

**Simple NPC who lives somewhere, with a separate origin, no travel**
Set origin to someplace, whereabouts to a single item without a date, with a type of "home"
renders as
From: <origin>
Based in: <home>

**Simple NPC who was met somewhere no info about origin or home**
Set origin empty, wherabouts to a single item with a date and type of "stop", and a place
Renders as

Current location: (xyz)
This is dynamic so it might render as (unknown) if it is before the stop date or after the stop-end date


[11/8/2023 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
**More complex NPC with a home, but potentially who was away from home for some period, but where doesn't matter**
Set origin and home as desired, but set at least 1.
Whereabouts is a single item with a start date and potential stop date, of type : traveling
renders as

From/based in as bove
Current location: travelling (if within the travel date) or (home) if after the travel date


[11/8/2023 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
**More complex NPC who has a home and traveling and met PCs on travels**
Set origin and home
whereabouts has 2 items, a travelling and a stopped

From/based as above
Current Location : travelling or stopped depending


[11/8/2023 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think this is the right idea


[11/8/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so origin moves out of whereabouts, and becomes its own yaml item, which is just text


[11/8/2023 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
whereabouts changes to have three types: traveling, stop, home


[11/8/2023 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
then also start-date, end-date, place, region


[11/8/2023 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
region should ideally always be either a top-level or a second-level note or folder in gazetteer


[11/8/2023 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
start-date, end-date, and place should be optional, i think


[11/8/2023 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
although start-date is really only optional for home


[11/8/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
(region could also be something in cosmology, of course)


[11/8/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
end-date is assumed to equal start date if blank for type = stopped


[11/8/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
end-date is assumed to equal current date if blank for type = traveling (unless current date < start date)


[11/8/2023 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i haven't spent enough time looking at your event table code to figure out if this is the most sensible setup


[11/8/2023 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but it seems like if we just ignore homes without dates for parsing it isn't too bad


[11/8/2023 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
could also move home out of whereabouts, have it a separate list that just takes start-date (optional), place (optional), region (required)


[11/8/2023 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
then if you want "moved to X" to show up in the events table you need  to add it to an tagged list or


[11/8/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
So a full spec would be something like

Calculate the "home" and "origin" values as follows:
1. If there is no whereabouts, home and origin are both equal to the origin front matter, and neither are considered dynamic.
2. If there is exactly one whereabouts with type home, and that line has no date, or a date before bornYear-01-03, origin = origin frontmatter, home = home whereabouts and neither are considered dynamic.
3. If there is more than one home whereabouts, or one home whereabouts with a date after bornYear-01-03, home = dynamic, origin = origin frontmatter

Output the following information:

For the origin line:
* If origin is undefined, output nothing.
* If origin equals home and home is not dynamic, output nothing.
* If origin does not equal home, or home is dynamic, output "Originally from: <origin>"

For the home line:
* If home is undefined, output nothing.
* If home is defined but not dynamic, and origin != home, output: "Based in: <home>"
* If home is defined but not dynamic, and origin == home, output : "Location: <home>"
* If home is defined and dynamic, output a DataviewJS call to get_DynamicHome (spec follows)

For the current whereabouts line:
* If home is dynamic, or there is at least one whereabouts line with a type of travelling or stopped, output a call to get_CurrentWhereabouts (spec follows)
* Else output blank

For the last seen by party line:
* If there is at least one entry in the last seen by party section, parse the last seen by party dates to generate the correct output (spec follows)


[11/8/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
Dynamic Home Spec:

Find the home item in whereabouts that is >= the current date and output "Based in: <home>".
If there is no home item that is >= current date, output nothing


[11/8/2023 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
Current Whereabouts Spec:

Throw away all whereabouts lines without a date.
Throw away all whereabouts lines with a start date > current date.
Throw away all of the whereabouts lines with an end date < current date.


[11/8/2023 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
If there is 1 stopped line and 0 travelling lines and any number of home lines:
Current location: <stopped>


[11/8/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
If there is 1 or more stopped line and 1 travelling line and any number of home lines and the date == one of the stopped date:
Current location: <stopped that matches date>

If there is any number of stopped line and 1 travelling line and any number of home lines and the date != the any of the stopped date:
Current location: <travelling>


[11/8/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
If there are no stopped or travelling, use home.


[11/8/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
If there are stopped and home but no travelling, use last stopped


[11/8/2023 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
So basically the idea is:

* If you only have a single item that matches, we use that
* If you have a traveling value and a stopped "inside" that traveling period, we use the stopped location only if the date == the stopped date (i.e. stopped has an implicit end of start)
* If you are NOT travelling, the stopped has no implicit end and we use it instead of home if it matches


[11/8/2023 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
If you JUST have traveling and no stopped, we use travelling


[11/8/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
So for example
* Home = 1703
* Stopped  A= 1719
* Stopped B = 1720

We use stopped A in 1719, Home before 1719, Stopped B after 1719


[11/8/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
So for example
Home = 1703
Stopped  A= 1719
Stopped B = 1720, end 1721

We use Stopped B only until 1721, home after that


[11/8/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
So for example
Home = 1703
Travelling = 1718
Stopped  A= 1719
Stopped B = 1720

We use stopped A only for 1719, stopped B for 1720, travelling for anything after 1720


[11/8/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
etc


[11/8/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the only change i would make is to have stopped always have an implicit end == start if not specified


[11/8/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
in the case of just a stopped line, the output would be Current Location: (unknown)


[11/8/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
if the current date != stopped date


[11/8/2023 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
the argument is that most of the time, if you just have a stopped line, that is an NPC who was just passing through a place, and you have no idea where they were before or are going after


[11/8/2023 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe they are still there - maybe they are traveling elsewhere


[11/8/2023 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
the point is that information hasn't been invented yet and shouldn't be assumed


[11/8/2023 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
traveling, on the other hand, is probably fine to just assume continues into the future, unless it is explicitly decided the person stops


[11/8/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
Right that makes it easier as well


[11/8/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, instead of the spec I wrote.
* Assume that all home dates have an implicit end date of "death year"
* Assume that all travelling dates haven an implict end date of "death year"
* Assume that all stopped dates have an implicit end date of start date

If there is exactly 1 stopped whereabouts. Use that. If there are multiple stops whereabouts use the last.
If there are 0 stopped whereabouts and exactly 1 travelling whereabout, use (traveling). If there are multiple travelling ones use the last.
If there are 0 stopped and 0 travelling, use the home. If there are multiple, use the last

If the year is after the death year, and no whereabout explicitly has start > death, use (deceased)


[11/8/2023 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
the way i'd do it is:
Throw away all whereabouts lines without a date.
Throw away all whereabouts lines with a start date > current date.
Throw away all of the whereabouts lines with an end date < current date.

check to see if we have a precise location: 
for each stop 
 if stop_end <= cur_date and stop_start >= cur_date
  print Location: <stopped location>; break

check to see if we are traveling:
for each traveling:
 if travel_start >= cur_date and !travel_end or if travel_start >= cur_date and travel_end <= cur_date:
   print Location: traveling in <region>; break


[11/8/2023 1:22 PM] rsulfuratus
could add as well the home checking, if you want someone with a dynamic home to have "Based In: <home>; Current Location: <home>" instead of just "Based In: <home>"


[11/8/2023 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
alternatively, you could always just print either "Current Location: <home>" or "Current Location: (unknown)" if you don't have a stopped or traveling location


[11/8/2023 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway i think this makes sense as a general idea


[11/8/2023 7:49 PM] rsulfuratus
do you know why this doesn't work?
```dataviewjs
await dv.view("_scripts/view/get_EventsTable", { yearStart: 1748, yearEnd: 1749, pageFilter: " \"_DM_/timelines/unified_timeline\" ",includeAll: true } )
```


[11/8/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
getting rid of the full path doesn't work either


[11/8/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
is it a file or a folder


[11/8/2023 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
file


[11/8/2023 8:06 PM] .deciusmus
You have a space between the leading quote and the path

But..

I was trying to fix some people's whereabouts and wasn't always sure it was correct


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
right, i'm looking at the recent changes now


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but also getting some weird bugs


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
```
Dataview: Failed to execute view '_scripts/view/get_HomeWhereabouts.js'.

I was still fixing stuff last night


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
do you have customJS


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
I moved a lot of stuff to depend on customJS


[11/10/2023 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
which file is showing this


[11/10/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah i have that


[11/10/2023 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
actually reloading obsidian seems to have fixed that particular issue


[11/10/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a fix for some issues btw


[11/10/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
The "new" whereabouts logic, btw, is as follows:

For simple NPCs just set origin to either origin: string or origin: { place: xxx, region: yyy }. Don't use whereabouts at all.
This will generate a dynamic "get_Homewhereabouts" line to the template, which will output either: Based in or Lived in depending on whether the NPC is alive or not.

For simple NPCs with a separate home and origin, set origin as above, plus a whereabouts with a {type: home, place:, region: } and no date.
This will generate a Originally from line with the origin plus a get_Homewhereabouts as above. 
If you know when the NPC moved from origin to home, you can set on a date on the home line. This will keep the originally from, but also add a "currentwhereabouts" dynamic line. (See below)

For complex NPCs with various more complexity, you set the full whereabouts structure. (see below)


[11/10/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
so i'm messing around a bit and actually i think the assumption that traveling continues forever is also probably wrong


[11/10/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. this is not necessarily correct:

current location for Dain is unknown - might still be traveling in Illoria but I actually have no idea and haven't invented that detail


[11/10/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
would be much more useful to me to have "Last Known Location" than "current location"


[11/10/2023 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
simple option is to just report Last Known Location (last whereabouts date): Location


[11/10/2023 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
right now not sure how lastSeenByParty is handled


[11/10/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
So I was messing around with the idea of visit having an "end: true" or "end: false"


[11/10/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
So for example Antonia is in the mirror of soul trapping, which is an indefinite visit


[11/10/2023 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
so I wanted her to show as "current location: mirror of soul trapping"




[11/10/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
oh the other reason we wanted 2 scripts was to separate the last seen by party


[11/10/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. to have

origin
home
last seen by part
last known
current


[11/10/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm trying to figure out the date logic you have, as I think i can do this simpler in python. the assumption is that we have either:
YYYY
YYYY-MM


[11/10/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
YYYY-MM-DD


[11/10/2023 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
and that for sorting and other purposes, if MM is missing, it is set to 1, and if DD is missing it is set to 1


[11/10/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/10/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
well, actually


[11/10/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
I think for "end" dates we assume 12-31 or last day


[11/10/2023 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a bunch of spec


[11/10/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/10/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
Encourage you to read the specs in _MOC\Templates and Scripts rather than look at a the Javascript


[11/10/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
fixed a lot of logical bugs when writing them


[11/10/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
you might be better off with just a reimplement from scratch using the spec than anything else


[11/10/2023 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
I think the specs are pretty clear and should be trivial to implement from


[11/10/2023 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
re: this "Note that in frontmatter, specifying YYYY-MM and YYYY-MM-01 are identical. If you want to indicate that the day is unknown, set the date as YYYY-MMx"


[11/10/2023 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
does this imply that if I split on `-` I can't assume outputs of split are ints?


[11/10/2023 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/10/2023 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
Javascript parseInt happily ignores the trailing junk


[11/10/2023 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
which makes it easy


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, we could define that ONLY MMx is valid


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
literally x I mean


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
no it doesn't matter, easy to trim non-numeric chars


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
just trying to get the clean_date function correct as everything depends on that


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/10/2023 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
the Javascript is  pain for that because we have 4 types of dates:

- Luxon dates from Dataview



[11/10/2023 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
In python you just have a string so in theory much easier


[11/10/2023 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
born, created, founded, built: these are used to determine at what point the page started to exist. If the page has a type, then only the type value will be used. Otherwise, the order here is searched and the first defined one used.


[11/10/2023 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
why don't we just use born and change the output text by type?


[11/10/2023 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
seems unnecessarily complicated for coding


[11/10/2023 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
or, if that is too annoying, use born (living things) created (non-living things)


[11/10/2023 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
died (living) destroyed (non-living)


[11/10/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus

but lets do born/created and died/destroyed

{Reactions}

[11/10/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
probably better to just say:

if NPC or Ruler or PC, use born
else if no type or any other type use created


[11/10/2023 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

The size of frontmatter was also making me reconsider the endStatus/prefix/etc


[11/12/2023 9:33 AM] rsulfuratus
no i'm using the default yaml package in base python. might need to switch to pyYAML for better control


[11/12/2023 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
oh, actually, i am using pyyaml, nvm


[11/12/2023 9:35 AM] .deciusmus
I think if you set default_flow_style = true it should get closer to what we want. 
I also think the set of empty frontmatter should be small


[11/12/2023 9:36 AM] .deciusmus
Ie don‚Äôt add everything in with empty values


[11/12/2023 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
i think it might make sense to collapse some stuff that doesn't need to be human readable easily into lists, e.g. could have a defaults frontmatter item (dict or list) that is auto-generated (by template or python) with all the various default text. would only take up one line of frontmatter


[11/12/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
and could easily extend to other defaults if desired


[11/12/2023 9:37 AM] .deciusmus
Right that‚Äôs not a bad idea


[11/12/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
i also was working on implemented an "optional/required" flag, where empty optional items are not output. so far this is just ka is only output for elves but could easily be extended to anything


[11/12/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
Do you have a source config somewhere for this?


[11/12/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
Where does the metadata list live?


[11/12/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
it is horrible, it is just a function that defines a metadata dict in the python code. but i will at some point (probably thanksgiving week, which i'm taking off) rewrite to parse a spec


[11/12/2023 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
If you make it a json file I‚Äôd write a templater that generates the new note from that


[11/12/2023 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
Could even have 2 templates one for minimal and one for all


[11/12/2023 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
the way i have it set up now is that i create a few dicts with different keys, combined them by type (so, e.g., NPC = core + people, Ruler = core + people + ruler, PC = core + people + PC), and then set defaults by type


[11/12/2023 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
I wasn't sure the best way to define this in json


[11/12/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
it would be trivial to have like 10 json files, and then do the combining and default-setting in code


[11/12/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah I‚Äôd have one json file per type plus a core


[11/12/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
And people


[11/12/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
Or rather, I‚Äôd have a set of ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù files like core,
Person, etc


[11/12/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
And then a single file that defines for each type which metadata files to use


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess you could do the default setting in the json if you just don't put things in core that have variable defaults by type


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. the defaults list could be part of the most-specific json


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
that would be easy too


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôd do the default in json and not put something like the end status in core. Just put it wherever


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/12/2023 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
you'd need a separate file to define which metadata is combined for which type, and also to define which elements are always output (even if blank) and which are only output if not blank


[11/12/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
although i guess the latter might be better as a spec that can be implemented separately in cleanup code and in templater


[11/12/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
the workflow would then be:
1. run cleanup code to make all notes conform to spec
2. use templater for new notes, ideally never running cleanup
3. if spec changes, update cleanup code and rerun to convert all notes to new spec


[11/12/2023 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/12/2023 9:50 AM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôd make it as data driven as possible, ie have a json file that defines:
Type -> metadata
And each metadata file has:
{ name: , outputIfEmpty: , default:


[11/12/2023 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
You might want to output died even if blank for rulers (most rulers are dead) but not for npcs and PCs for@example


[11/12/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that's fine


[11/12/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
how annoying would it be to parse defaults that refer to variables in templater / javascript? e.g.:
```
name : { required; True, default: <file-name> }
```


[11/12/2023 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
Not annoying


[11/12/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
where required implies "always-output" and the `<>` syntax would mean "replace with a variable of this name if exists"


[11/12/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
okay, that seems like the best option then


[11/12/2023 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm not sure the point of something like replace name with filename though


[11/12/2023 9:57 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe not


[11/12/2023 9:58 AM] rsulfuratus
that specific example


[11/12/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
but could be used for example to implement your folder -> ancestry map, for example, if that was useful


[11/12/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
My view on metadata is that is serves 3 purposes:
1. To be used by the header generation template to generate consistent Wikipedia style bio-blocks
2. To by used by the dynamic dataview/python code for whereabouts, page dated value, and regnal year
3. For dataview queries


[11/12/2023 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/12/2023 10:01 AM] .deciusmus
Anything that is used by (2) we should prefer having defaults in yaml. So that there is a single source of truth. But for (1) it is perhaps nicer to have the default logic in JavaScript


[11/12/2023 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus
for new notes, sure


[11/12/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
I just mean, we should in general try to prefer smaller rather than larger frontmatter


[11/12/2023 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
Anyway I gotta go shopping before my D&D game and still have three tower levels in the hobgoblin fort to make up, so can continue this later but not right now

[11/12/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
Speaking of my game today, any thoughts on holy symbols for the Father and the Night Queen?
Thinking for the father:
Simplest - a line with a circle with rays  on top, representing a scepter with the sun at the top. More complex would include details of scepter sun

Night queen - five dots in a circle, representing the outline of a crown of stars. More complex would represent the crown (seen top down). Alternate sometimes seen: just three stars in an arch with an implied horizon, representing transition to and from the night/life/death


[11/12/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
I like both of those. for night queen perhaps stylized stars not dots? as an amulet or holy symbol assume it would be a styled crown in general


[11/12/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah. Sounds good


[11/12/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
In this case it will come up scrawled on walls as graffiti / ward against undead


[11/12/2023 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
btw, here is the history of a ruined villa in western Cymea that is the setting for my game tonight
The Perdoli Manor (*Pehr-DOH-lee*) was build in 1479, by the wealthy Perdoli family, merchants and traders. Got rich off wine and control over a marble quarry in the hills, built manor as a place to relax and get away, about a day's journey into the hills from Vistalba. 

The family enjoyed the manor for several generations, until the Great War. The Perdoli family faired poorly, and came out of the Great War having lost much of their wealth (details don't really matter). A few years after the Great War, forced to sell the villa. The new owners were not much better, and never lived there, and couldn't afford the upkeep. Some stone was scavenged during this time, but it was too far away to be convenient. The new owners died without heirs, living the manor to fall into disrepair and ruin in the 1590s. 

It stood empty save from occasional wandering travelers seeking shelter far from home for the next 30 years or so, generally falling out of memory of the local villagers, who had other problems to deal with. 

In the 1620s, the manor was reoccupied by a medusa, who made it her lair for 30 years, during which time it acquired a reputation as a cursed place, and fell further into disrepair. The medusa eventually succumbed to her reflection, caught unexpectedly by the water in a fountain. While she lived there, some crude repairs were made to the manor, scavenging stone from outbuildings as needed. 

In the 1690s, a group of pirates and bandits fleeing the beginnings of Tollender persecution moved in and made it a hideaway for the next 15 years or so. They dug tunnels and built a secret room behind the wine cellar to store treasure, and repaired the smithy/forge and parts of the manor, in a crude fashion. The leader was killed by the Tollender Navy in the 1720s, and the lair was gradually abandoned. 

It has sat empty since then, until recent events.

It‚Äôs dungeon crawl day in Taelgar


[11/12/2023 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/12/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
Do you have any issue with lots of undead across sembara in the winter of 1720, btw? Like 10s of skeletons and zombies appearing in lots of little villages and towns across a wide swath of southern sembara.


[11/12/2023 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
sounds great


[11/12/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
The lich cast some spell that awakened say, 0.01% of all the dead in sembara


[11/12/2023 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
i keep thinking that you all should go find someone who remembers the lich in sembara to ask about how to kill liches


[11/12/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
That would be a good idea but none of us know about the lich


[11/12/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
right, i need a way to introduce it. maybe when you get back to tollen


[11/12/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I mean you could tell Wellby he remembers from his childhood


[11/12/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's true, i guess it was probably a pretty big deal when the lich was exposed?


[11/12/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah. It‚Äôs going to be summer 1720


[11/12/2023 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
So like a year or two before he was born. But a big deal for everyone in the region


[11/12/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
I have no idea how the lich was defeated. It doesn‚Äôt matter actually since the PCs will not be involved. All I know is that a human woman paladin or fighter (who was involved in the backstory of one of my PCs) is part of it


[11/12/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm, yeah, i'll think a bit. even if i introduce in game those details wouldn't matter for several sessions, as presumably you'd need to get back to tollen and ask around. all wellby would remember is there was a lich who was killed


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
The only other thing is that the lich wasn‚Äôt actually killed. Just everyone thought he was killed. In reality he ended up trapped by mind flayers in a complex plot


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
But that plot is canonically secret, ie even if my players fail no one in sembara would reallly know about it


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/12/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
But that won‚Äôt be remotely relevant to my game until summer 2024 at the very soonest


[11/12/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
And I don‚Äôt have well plotted details


[11/12/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
So I have lots of flexibility to let whatever comes up in dunmar game to be canonical as long as it‚Äôs possible to somehow have the lich re-emerge later. It could be even not the actual lich, but something related to him. 

The only plot I‚Äôm committed to is underdark/mind flayers vibe as the bad guys plus the necessity to run all over sembara region to find info/items/legends/something


[11/12/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
And that I want the lich prologue that‚Äôs running now to be connected to the ‚Äúmain plot‚Äù so the lich has to be involved somehow


[11/12/2023 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
the idea is that the mind flayers are somehow in control of the lich, or the lich is in control of the mind flayers? or you haven't decided?


[11/12/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
Haven‚Äôt decided


[11/12/2023 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
My original idea was that the mind flayers were in control of the lichs phylatcertry and when he was ‚Äúkilled‚Äù instead of letting him come back to life they imprisoned him with the idea of using his undeath to fuel a chaylyte golem that would be functionally unstopped and kill everyone


[11/12/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
But I‚Äôm not committed to that - all I‚Äôm committed to is
A) mind flayers under the Sentinel Ranger 
B) who are doing something bad
C) related to the lich in some fashion
D) where to solve the problem the PCs have to go to a bunch of different places in greater sembara


[11/12/2023 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
btw - it might be too late for your game today or not relevant - but I made up the elf from our last session thinking they could be a chararacter who could show up in your game.

### Vahaiya
*va-HAI-ya*, like va-HIGH-ya
A well-connected collector of elven painting, of the 36th ka. They survived the Great War, fighting alongside Sembarans in the Battle of [[Urlich Pass]]. After the war, could not settle, and did not return to have children during their first mela. Traveled and fought with the rangers for a time, spent time around Massau, Addermarch, fighting hobgoblins, until by 1700 was tired of fighting. Had amassed some considerable skill in arms, and favors and knowledge from a wide swath of people, including many rangers. Word of their deeds spread, and returns to Orenlas - which is particularly close to Addermarch - in the early 1700s, tired, feeling out of cycle, uncertain about having missed their first mela, wanting the strength of Aldanor's roots just as Elmerca's winds are scattering the newly awakened elves of the small and uncertain 37th ka. Decides to stay in Orenlas. Given their fame, attracts a number of gifts, and finds particular joy in painting. Even has one of Beryl's paintings, a very rare piece if not particularly amazingly crafted, and a gift from the Rangers.

[11/13/2023 4:55 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly, feels like people is pretty clear, but other types are not

not sure the repo is the best place to think through ideas though


[11/13/2023 4:58 PM] rsulfuratus
in particular, we have a lot of different types of notes in gazetteer, including specific buildings, settlements, geographic features, culture/politics, civilizations/kingdoms (which overlap but don't totally encompass culture), big regions, etc


[11/13/2023 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
I was also messing around a bit.

This:

```dataviewjs
const { metadataUtils } = customJS

await dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PersonTable", {     
    header: ["Location", "Name", "Born"],
    map: p => [p.currentLocation, p.name, p.life.startDate?.display ?? "unknown" ],
    where: p => metadataUtils.inLocation("Dunmar", p.file.frontmatter)
} )
```

[11/13/2023 7:35 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, the basic set of metadata utils might be easier to code and maintain in python. python at least seems like a much simpler language to handle e.g. dates and some of the sorting stuff


[11/13/2023 7:37 PM] rsulfuratus
however, that particular package relies on node.js so i have no idea if that is even functional in obsidian


[11/13/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
theoretically I think the idea would be to have a core set of metadata processing functions written in python, e.g.:
pass metadata, get current whereabouts
pass metadata, get origin whereabouts
pass metadata, get age


[11/13/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
then, separately code functions in python or javascript to use that information


[11/13/2023 7:53 PM] rsulfuratus
things that are basic reformatting are easy to code in either and there is probably no reason to try to synchronize


[11/13/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
to export things that require parsing the vault would either require a way to call the obsidian and dataviewjs apis from python, or an alternate approach to get the same kind of information


[11/13/2023 7:54 PM] .deciusmus
Dataview provides a lot of stuff; going to be hard to do via python


[11/13/2023 7:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yes. anything that only requires the information about the current page metadata is straightforward to replicate in python given a core set of functions that return information from metadata


[11/13/2023 7:56 PM] rsulfuratus
anything that requires querying the vault as a database is quite tricky and probably requires finding someone else who has done the coding


[11/13/2023 8:02 PM] .deciusmus
The main problem with Python is that everything has to be wrapped in JS


[11/13/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
It's fine to have like a core Python "get whereabouts state" or "get page existence state" that returns back and object, but to do all the various dynamic bits needs JS functoins


[11/13/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
So I could see, for example, an architecture working where you have a core python lib that returns, for a given page, some set of data like the current/last known/home/origin whereabouts, the regnalData, and the page Existence data

And then the JS functions for Dataview could wrap those


[11/13/2023 8:06 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. 

```
    inLocation(targetLocation, metadata, targetDate) {
  
        if (!targetDate) targetDate = this.get_pageEventsDate(metadata)
        let current = this.get_currentWhereabouts(metadata, targetDate);
        if (current == undefined || current.location == undefined || current.location == "Unknown") {      
            return false;
        }

        let found = this.locationSearch(current.location, targetLocation)
        return found;
    }
```

could be somethng like

```
inLocation(targetLocation, metadata, targetDate) {
    let whereabouts = pyLib.getWhereaboutsForPage(metadata, targetDate)
     let current = whereabouts.current
....
```


[11/13/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that is what I was imaging


[11/13/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
python just handles metadata in, object out


[11/13/2023 8:08 PM] rsulfuratus
that simplifies debugging and maintanence for basic info boxes


[11/13/2023 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't help with the more fundamental issue about web export. to me, a lot of this metadata stuff feels extremely useful for session prep, information cleanup, and other tracking stuff. but it feels quite challenging to figure out how to incorporate into the webpage


[11/13/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn't really worrying about that


[11/13/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
I like seeing it for session prep and fun


[11/13/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
and info cleanup


[11/13/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
The only architecture that is likely to work for export is something that captures the rendered data in obsidian


[11/13/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
reimplementing dataview isn't realistic I don't think


[11/13/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
this is part way there, actually: https://github.com/mfarragher/obsidiantools

[11/13/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
But I bet that is focused on the simple dataview stuff, not dataview JS


[11/13/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
it looks like it is pretty easy to, for example, get all the notes with the event-source tag, and a DR tag between 1600 and 1700


[11/13/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
so that is a decent bit of the way there


[11/13/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't implement the task/list tags


[11/13/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
as far as I can see


[11/13/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
right, but that isn't that close to what dataviewJs lets you do


[11/13/2023 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/13/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
my get_EventsTable is doing a **lot** more than that


[11/13/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
obviously. i think at the moment i'm more interested in getting the basic metadata functions really solid and making sure the python export can handle info boxes smoothly, as well as figuring out the metadata structure for more complex things like places, than solving the web export issue for dataviewjs, which I think is your feeling too


[11/13/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/13/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
Although I'm also interested in learning a bit of javascript and having the tools to rapidly prototype various types of dynamic exploration of the data


[11/13/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
it wouldn't take that much fiddling to clean up metadataUtils.py to make it something that could theoretically be imported into Javascript


[11/13/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
I think it would need to be a little differently structured


[11/13/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
but.. it would be doable


[11/13/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
maybe I should learn python instead of Javascript


[11/13/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
well someone needs to know javascript


[11/13/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so looking at the JSPyBridge some more, I think what you'd want is a python function returns all the computed variables on a metadata object, right? 

e.g., in python, you have:
```python
def get_computed_metadata(metadata):
    # code goes here
    return computed_dict
```

then, in Javascript:
```javascript
import { python } from 'pythonia'
const computeMetadata = await python('./metadataUtils.py')
computed_metadata = await {computeMetadata.get_computed_metadata(metadata)
```


[11/13/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
well, maybe


[11/13/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
probably; you'd just want it relatively well structured


[11/13/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
there are also some grey areas .. is the "current" location computed or not


[11/13/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i would consider that computed


[11/13/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, the ideal would be to compute a bunch of stuff...

* Current whereabout
* Last known whereabout
* Home whereabout
* Origin whereabout
* Start / End date
* Age
* Is Alive
* Is Existing
* etc


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think your current code actually computes those all correctly though


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i haven't yet found a page that my current code doesn't correctly compute, but i haven't checked everything


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
there could be edge cases


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
Well, I mean, I think it is correct to the spec


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
But its the wrong


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
wrong model


[11/13/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
"current" should be undefined for dead people, for example


[11/13/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
"last known" should potentially be home, if that is the last known place


[11/13/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
a few other similar things


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i do check when people died, and correctly report nothing for current location


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i was not positive what to do with last known


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i played around with setting last known to location when died, but that is not technically last known if it was an away location


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right I don't mean your dview is wrong, I mean the metadataUtil doen't have the right level of data


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
right spec, whatever


[11/13/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
my parse metadata code does a little too much for one function. i am pretty sure the exact, home, origin, and last locations are correct, but it is probably better to allow a different function to decide what to output when instead of trying to overload that on the same function


[11/13/2023 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
it relies on setting output to false instead of updating location in some cases, which isn't as correct as you'd want for something you can pass back and forth


[11/13/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
It does assume the whereabouts are sorted by date


[11/13/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
Which is probably reasonable


[11/13/2023 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
at least if I am reading the python correctly it does üôÇ


[11/13/2023 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
who knows?


[11/13/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
it only assumes this for home without dates


[11/13/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
or at least it should only assume for homes without dates


[11/13/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway the exact details don't matter, it is relatively feasible to update this code to return whatever is useful for the javascript if you want to try to use it in javascript, or alternatively to have a wrapper function to generate a formatted dict however the javascript code wants it


[11/13/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm actually more interested in figuring out location metadata than fiddling with code sychronization


[11/13/2023 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/13/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
That‚Äôs reasonable


[11/13/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
although i am adding a bit of documentation and cleanup to my code right now


[11/13/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
will push in a bi


[11/13/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
*bit


[11/13/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
did you look at my location musings in the metadata spec?


[11/13/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
As far as metadata, for places in general I‚Äôm not sure the point in distinguishing much


[11/13/2023 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
right maybe you just need one place type with a bunch of optional fields


[11/13/2023 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Why not just have ‚ÄúpartOf‚Äù and ‚Äúlocation‚Äù ? Otherwise the created / destroyed  is optional


[11/13/2023 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Im a little skeptical of population


[11/13/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
But maybe worth having to help with a standardized header block. But I‚Äôm actually not sure there is much benefit to a standard header


[11/13/2023 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing that I want to do is move all the pronounciation stuff to metadata, so I can easily make a dataview query for how to pronounce everything - it's a big pain having to click over to each note


[11/13/2023 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
Yes


[11/13/2023 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
Agree with that


[11/13/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but I also want it in the header of the note, so in that case having a standardized header, even if it is just:
```
# Name
*(pronounciation)*
```


[11/13/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
might be worthwhile


[11/13/2023 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
you also might want to generate a standard "x of y"


[11/13/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
I also want to have standard headers for my session notes although I don‚Äôt know if you want to bother


[11/13/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., 
```
# Gold Street
a ward of [[Tollen]]
```


[11/13/2023 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/13/2023 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Although isn‚Äôt that easy enough to type?


[11/13/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
if it is just one layer, sure


[11/13/2023 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
if you are doing: [[Tollen]], [[Tollen partOf]]


[11/13/2023 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
then you want a template I think


[11/13/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
But do you really want:
# The Crossroads Inn
an inn in [[Cleenseau]], [[Averil]], [[Sembara]]


[11/13/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe you do?


[11/13/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd probably only go two levels up


[11/13/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe three levels


[11/13/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
three levels might be overkill for display


[11/13/2023 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
I guess you could have:

- partOf
- placeType
- population


[11/13/2023 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
- name


[11/13/2023 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I was going to say I would like placeType for sure. my DM notes for the Tollen sessions were a lot of copying and pasting of things and embedding notes, it would be a lot faster if I could just do a dataview query for wards of Tollen


[11/13/2023 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
And then generate

# <Name>
(Pronunciation)
A <placeType> in <partOf>
(Population) / getPageDatedValue


[11/13/2023 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd do:


[11/13/2023 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
A <placeType> in <partOf>, <partOfParent>


[11/13/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
Right I meant ‚ÄúpartOf‚Äù to be 2 levels up

{Reactions}
üëç

[11/13/2023 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the other question is whether we want to have tags for specific levels of organization. e.g., I saw you using cultureDescriptor to tag the page a specific ancestry links to


[11/13/2023 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
I actually don‚Äôt like that. I‚Äôd rather have something in metadata.json I think that defines page names for species and cultures


[11/13/2023 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
I like keeping the frontmatter simpler


[11/13/2023 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
So I‚Äôd say the header should be:

As is for people / rulers
As above for locations (anything with type - Location)
Items tbd
Anything else will be just
# name 
(Pronounciation)


[11/13/2023 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
okay. I might then run my metadata cleanup one more time and do the following:
- convert the startStatus, endStatus stuff into a displayDefaults dict with sensible defaults per type
- output a very short list of required metadata (that is output even if blank): tags, displayDefaults, born/species/ancestry/gender for People; reignEnd/reignStart/died for rulers; placeType, partOf for locations


[11/13/2023 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
Just don‚Äôt make reignEnd default to anything

{Reactions}
üëç

[11/13/2023 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
and type of course


[11/13/2023 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
I mess around with death dates it is a pain to have to change reignEnd


[11/13/2023 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
valid types will be: 
- Ruler
- NPC


[11/13/2023 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
It should be optional / not output

{Reactions}
üëç

[11/13/2023 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
so just born/species/ancestry/gender for all people, nothing extra for rulers?


[11/13/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
ReignStart for rulers

{Reactions}
üëç

[11/13/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
On the display status stuff, I think it‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôd drop the pre-exist error


[11/13/2023 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so it would be trivial to add all these tags to metadata


[11/13/2023 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I was wondering about e.g., if you have #place, can you add #place/settlement and have #place get both #place and #place/settlement, while #place/settlement gets only #place/settlement


[11/13/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
I don't know


[11/13/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
but how often do you care?


[11/13/2023 10:11 PM] .deciusmus
I'd rather have a PC have 
tags: [ person, PC ]

then

tags: [person/PC ]


[11/13/2023 10:11 PM] .deciusmus
and hope that #person matches both


[11/13/2023 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that is a fairly simple case


[11/13/2023 10:12 PM] .deciusmus
although I just tested, it does work


[11/13/2023 10:12 PM] .deciusmus
so nesting is certainly feasible


[11/13/2023 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I am more thinking for campaign stuff


[11/13/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and for negative queries, e.g. if I want all the stuff that does not have a status tag


[11/13/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
I think I would say that:

(campaignPrefix/*) 

is undefined


[11/13/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
I might not want to do the same things as well


[11/13/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
as you


[11/13/2023 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure I quite get your point. hierachies under the campaginPrefix would be exclusively for dataview queries and such, you wouldn't use them for frontmatter or headers


[11/13/2023 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
The real question is:

* person, person/PC, person/ruler OR person, PC, ruler
* place, place/settlement, place/country, place/river OR place, river, settlement, country

etc


[11/13/2023 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
What I mean is your metadata cleanup shouldn't assume anything about campaign tags


[11/13/2023 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, yes, okay, that makes sense


[11/13/2023 10:16 PM] .deciusmus
And for example, a newly created NPC shouldn't have

tags: [NPC/DuFr/unsorted, NPC/Clee/unsorted, NPC/GL/unsorted]

or whatever


[11/13/2023 10:16 PM] .deciusmus
"unsorted" for DuFr would just be "!#DuFr"


[11/13/2023 10:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yes exactly


[11/13/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
if you then wanted ot add a [DuFr/unaware] to my NPCs that is fine


[11/13/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
But separately, I was proposing a proper, not-tag-based, mechanism to track campaign info


[11/13/2023 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I do sometimes use the tab browser, and it is pretty annoying if it gets extremely cluttered. so for that reason I'd probably lean towards nested tags


[11/13/2023 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, they are more annoying to type if they get more than 2 deep


[11/13/2023 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think a good mechanism would not necessarily be super-strict


[11/13/2023 10:21 PM] .deciusmus
So replace

lastSeenByParty 

with

campaignInfo:
- { campaign: (a prefix), date: (a date, optional), type: (a string, optional) }

This would do 2 things:

1. The "last seen by party" template header output would continue to be generated
2. I'd add some mechanism so that you could do something like:

util.campaignStatus("prefix", "type")
util.isKnownToCampaign("prefix")

This would make it easy to generate place or NPC tables that contain only those places, NPCs, etc that a party knows about


[11/13/2023 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be great


[11/13/2023 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
so for example if you had:

- { campaign: DuFr,  date: 1748-01-01, type: met }
- { campaign: DuFr,  date: 1748-05-01, type: scryed }

It would generate:

* Last met by party (on 1748-01-01): (location)
* Last scryed by party (on 1748-05-01): (location)

Obviously rare to bother with that level of detail, but it could build up esp in my game where it is not that hard to add that stuff over time


[11/13/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
Then, additionally, if "isKnownToCampaign" returns true if there is any matching entry either with no date or with a date in the past


[11/13/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
and CampaignStatus returns true if a matching type is no date or in past


[11/13/2023 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so one thing I am eventually going to write is some code to grab the last time an NPC was mentioned in session notes and backfill all the campaignInfo


[11/13/2023 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
so the 95% case could just be:

campaignInfo: [ { campaign: DuFr} ]

that means that DuFr knows about this NPC or place, no one else does


[11/13/2023 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
the 4% case could be:

campaignInfo: [ { campaign: DuFr, date: somedate } ]

and then the 1% case could be the actually complicated where you have different dates for met vs scryed vs contacted or whatever


[11/13/2023 10:26 PM] rsulfuratus
that is pretty nice.


[11/13/2023 10:30 PM] rsulfuratus
so to update:
1. delete endStatus, startPrefix, endPrefix, etc and create displayDefaults instead
2. delete lastSeenByParty and create campaignInfo instead
3. delete type and instead add relevant tag (person, place, thing, etc, with for now person/pc and person/ruler)
4. delete blank metadata except for a small handful of key things: tags, name, born/species/ancestry/gender for people, player for PC, reignStart for rulers, partOf, placeType for locations


[11/13/2023 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/13/2023 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
what about dates?


[11/13/2023 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
obviously DR stays; as does DR-end


[11/13/2023 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
fc-date and fc-end as well


[11/13/2023 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
realWorldDate


[11/13/2023 10:32 PM] .deciusmus
fc-date and fc-end for reoccurring events
realWorldDate for sessionNotes
DR and DR_end for events or session notes (use DR_end not DR-end) as _ is eeasier to manage in JS

anything else I will pass on untouched if it is not empty, delete if it is empty, and then any additional little cleanup can be done directly with the Properties View in Obisidian


[11/13/2023 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
that is I think easier than trying to program all the little edge cases


[11/13/2023 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus
oh also I'm going to assume that anything in gazetteer is a place, even though that is not quite strictly true, and add place tags to everything as well as empty partOf: to help make that fast to fill in

[11/13/2023 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus
at the moment, I'm not going to clean up tags any more than inserting person, place, thing, person/ruler, person/pc


[11/13/2023 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a tag wrangler plugin (https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler) so I think probably most tag cleanup is easier done in obsidian itself

spent a bit of time this morning doing a bit of manual cleanup. there are still a handful of yaml lines that, for some unexplained reason, got output in "long form" but I don't think this is worth debugging in my python code. at some point we might consider https://platers.github.io/obsidian-linter/ if we really want to enforce strict yaml rules


[11/14/2023 11:10 AM] rsulfuratus
i am pretty busy this afternoon but might work on python code tonight - i think it would make sense to merge the metadata_cleanup PR, since right now my git history is a mess and all my python coding commits are intermingled with metadata cleaning commits, which is bad form but hard to resolve without just merging to main and starting a new python branch to clean up python functions


[11/14/2023 11:10 AM] rsulfuratus
(alternatively I might work on actual content tonight, we'll see)

I pushed a few small changes to your metadata branch and spot checked it


[11/14/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
So looks reasonable to merge


[11/14/2023 11:16 AM] rsulfuratus
i'll merge PR now, have to fix few merge conflicts but should be minor


[11/14/2023 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
would be nice to make the template generator get info from tags since we don't have type anymore, would make it faster to regenerate headers


[11/14/2023 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah I can fix that


[11/14/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
I was mucking about with whereabouts because I‚Äôm trying to get a solid :

- give me a list of all people who are in place X at time Y


[11/14/2023 11:20 AM] .deciusmus
And I think the concept of current / home / origin / last know is not quite right


[11/14/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
But I‚Äôll take a few min to look at cleaned up template stuff


[11/14/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
Do you use the ‚Äúregenerate front matter‚Äù template or just the regen header / insert header ones ?


[11/14/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
I just use the header templates


[11/14/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
I was going to delete the front matter one as it is confusing and not up to date


[11/14/2023 11:43 AM] .deciusmus
Ok:

Template1 : Regenerate Header
Purpose: Deletes the header block and inserts the generate header template

Condition: File must have at least one tag, must not have a tags containing "stub"

Make sense?


[11/14/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
why not allow header regeneration for stubs? a lot of things i would tag stub are things with just header info


[11/14/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
but could use a different tag for that i guess


[11/14/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe stub = nothing


[11/14/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
wip = basic info but needs text


[11/14/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
i would say must have at least one non-status tag


[11/14/2023 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
you mean at least one tag that doesn't start status ?


[11/14/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/14/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
the idea being you shouldn't be able to regenerate headers for notes with just:
---
tags: [status/stub]

{Reactions}

[11/14/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus

tags: [status/stub]

no header

---
tags: [person, status/stub]

gets a header


[11/14/2023 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
to what extent do you think the header should look nice if there is very minimal info?


[11/14/2023 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. it is easier to code if we always generate the 

[!info]+ Biographical Summary

bit even if there is nothing else to do (for people, I mean)


[11/14/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
here is my attempt at a new whereabouts spec:

A whereabouts entry consists of four parts: 
- a type, which can be home or away
- a start, which is any date, an empty string, or a null/None value
- an end, which is any date, an empty string, or a null/None value
- a location, which is any string, which can be empty, or a null/None

A whereabouts entry must have a type.
A whereabouts entry with a type of away must have a start that is a valid date.

To calculate a whereabouts result requires a whereabouts metadata and a target date. The target date is usually the current date, but can be overwritten with yaml frontmatter (e.g. pageTargetDate). Functions to calculate whereabouts locations assume they will always be passed a metadata object from which whereabouts can be extracted, and a target date. If there is a pageTargetDate in the metadata, this will override the target date passed to the function. 

Given a whereabouts and a target date two additional values are calculated - imputed start and imputed end
for type home, the imputed start is equal to the earliest possible date, and the imputed end is equal to the target date
for type away, imputed start is always equal to start, which must be provided. if start is YYYY or YYYY-MM, imputed start should be the earliest valid month/day
for type away, imputed end is always equal to imputed_start


[11/14/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
1. An origin whereabouts is defined as the earliest 'home' location, where earliest is defined as the smallest imputed start.
If multiple home locations have the same date, the lexigraphically first home is considered the origin whereabouts.

2. A home whereabouts is defined as the valid home location with the shortest duration between imputed start and target date.
A valid home location is a home location where imputed end >= target date
If there are multiple valid home locations with equal duration between imputed start and target date, the lexigraphically last home is considered the home whereabouts.

3. A current whereabouts is defined as the valid current location with the shortest duration. 
A valid current location is determined by the following algorithm:
- if there are no away lines in the whereabouts, the only valid current location is the home location
- if there are away lines, the list of valid current locations is the set of away locations where imputed start <= target_date <= imputed_end
- if the list of valid current locations is empty, then the current whereabouts is set to unknown if real end is undefined, and home otherwise
- if the list of valid current locations is not empty, then the current whereabouts is set to the valid location with the shortest duration (imputed_end - imputed_start)


[11/14/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
4. A last know whereabouts is defined as the valid current location with the shortest duration, defined as imputed_end - target_date. A known location cannot be unknown
A known location is determined by the following algorithm:
- if the current whereabouts is not unknown, the last known whereabouts is the current whereabouts, and the last known date is the target date
- if the current whereabouts is unknown, by definition there must be away lines, and there must be away lines with undefined real ends. in this scenario, to determine the last known location:
    - the last known location is the away lines where imputed_start <= target_date and with the shortest duration between imputed_end and target_date 
    - if there are multiple valid last known locations, the one with the shortest duration (imputed_end - imputed_start) is preferred
    - if there are multiple valid last known locations with the same duration, the one lexigraphically last in the file is preferred
    - the last known date is defined as the imputed_end of the last known location

[11/14/2023 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
Want to read that but trying to finish the header spec...


[11/14/2023 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
For the header, I have basically:

# <name>
> Biographical Info
> species (ancestry), pronouns
> get_pageDatedValue (ka for elves)
> > origin
> > home
> > last seen by party
> > current whereabouts


[11/14/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
that seems good to me


[11/14/2023 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
where:
(a) name block is always generated
(b) page dated value is always generated (it should return blank if there are no dates for the page)
(c) origin home etc are generated for any page that has whereabouts
(d) species line doesn't show the bits that are not in frontmatter


[11/14/2023 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, maybe I should only output page dated if the tag indicates it is a person, place, item, or organization


[11/14/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd leave pageDated for everything - if we eventually want to do something like add a date for events, e.g. just 
# Name
DR 567 - 677


[11/14/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
also, we should add pronuciation if it is not blank


[11/14/2023 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
although I guess for events that might not need to be dynamic


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so maybe better to only output for person, place, item, organization. or you could just check to see if born/created/died/destroyed is not null and only output if there are values for at least one of those


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
Where should pronunciation go?


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
# name

or


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
#name
bio
(pro)


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd do:

# Name
*(pronuncidation)*

Biographical Info
species (ancestry), pronouns
get_pageDatedValue (ka for elves)
> origin
> home
> last seen by party
> current whereabouts


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
I like to see that right at the top of the page


[11/14/2023 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus

yes


[11/14/2023 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
for other common types, I'd do something like:
1. for locations, output pageDated and "a <placeType> in <partOf1>, <partOf2>. also maybe output popuation if not blank, like age for pageDated. there might be other summary information for places that could be useful, but not positive


[11/14/2023 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
2. for items, output pagedDated and some kind of summary from magical, unique (for items that are unique or that represent a type), [mechanics](ddbLink), maker, owner


[11/14/2023 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
at the moment almost none of these are filled in so items is kind of low priority IMO


[11/14/2023 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
locations is more interesting because it is quite fast to fill in location metadata by hand and a lot of locations are stubs that could benefit from simple orientation information


[11/14/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
organizations probably don't really need much tbh, i don't have anything set for any organizations yet and founded/disbanded dates are generally not actually that important (especially because they can be a little ambiguous). probably a historical tag to indicate "was primarily active long ago and isn't a "current day" organization" is better

its hard to know what "kingdom" is though

but we might need to see how the partOf stuff develops before deciding

I hit my usage limit on chatGPT so can't tinker any more but it should generally be working. you can give more than one language. going to try to add taelgar languages are a certain point (e.g., Galadriel, Elvish would be -> Galadriel, Quenya or Sindarin; Apollyon, Drankorian -> Apollyon, Greek or Latin, etc)

> To calculate a whereabouts result requires a whereabouts metadata and a target date. The target date is usually the current date, but can be overwritten with yaml frontmatter (e.g. pageTargetDate). Functions to calculate whereabouts locations assume they will always be passed a metadata object from which whereabouts can be extracted, and a target date. If there is a pageTargetDate in the metadata, this will override the target date passed to the function. 

From a specification perspective this isn't true. I might want to get the whereabouts at the last met by party date, for example. In which case the page date shouldn't override that.

From a specification standpoint I would just say "whereabouts has a target date" and leave it at that. The python function should require an input target date and fail if it isn't passed

I think that the imputed end is not target date. I would say that:
for type = home, the imputed_start is the minimum date and the imputed_end is the maximum date
for type = away, the start is required, and the imputed_end is the imputed_start

Question - if you have something with type: away and start: 1602, does that imply away for ALL of 1602? I think yes. Which would mean that the imputed_end for YYYY is YYYY-12-31 and for YYYY-MM is YYYY-MM-lastDayOfMM


[11/14/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
It seems weird otherwise that someone with a 
type: away, start: 1602, location: Sembara is considered "in sembara" only on 01-01-1602

Agree here


[11/14/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus

Agree here.


[11/14/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
> An origin whereabouts is defined as the earliest 'home' location, where earliest is defined as the smallest imputed start.

Actually wait, this isn't right. The origin location is simply the first location that has type = home and no start.

I want to be able to say:

type: home, start: 1700, location: Cleenseau # date is approx

To represent someone with definitely no origin, i.e. where I know they didn't come from Cleenseau


[11/14/2023 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
This is distinguished from:

type: home, location: Cleenseau

which indicates they should be considered as "from" Cleenseau

vs

type: home, location: Embry
type: home, location: Cleenseau

for someone who is from Emby and now lives in Cleenseau

I don't think this is quite right. I think what you do is calculate the valid location (imputed start <= target date <= imputed end) where the start is closest to the target date, just like for home. 

But instead of imputed_end = end ?? start for type = away and imputed_end = end ?? max for home, you use imputed end = end ?? max date for both.

That gets you the "best match location". Then, either
(a) this location is type home - use it as current, last known is none
(b) this location is type away and has a real end - use it as current, last known is none
(c) this location is type away and has an undefined real end - 
then, if the target date == start date, use it as current, last known is none
otherwise, use it as last known, current as none


[11/14/2023 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I updated some things in the _MOC/Templates/Whereabouts and Location Specification

> Question - if you have something with type: away and start: 1602, does that imply away for ALL of 1602? I think yes. Which would mean that the imputed_end for YYYY is YYYY-12-31 and for YYYY-MM is YYYY-MM-lastDayOfMM

yes, this is automatic in my code, as I have a clean_date function that takes a possibly incomplete date and returns either start (earliest valid) or end (latest valid). start/born always calculated as earliest valid, end/died always calculated as latest valid, unless this needs to be overridden for some reason


[11/14/2023 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
It's all even simpler. You need:

filter_whereabouts
Given a whereabout list, a target date, and optional valid type this will return the whereabouts in the file order from the whereabout list that
(a) are valid (imputed start <= target <= imputed end && type matching if type specified)
(b) have the smallest possible target - start from amongst the valid items


[11/14/2023 4:56 PM] .deciusmus
origin = filter(target, "home").first()
if (origin.start) origin = undefined.

home = filter(target, "home").last()

current = filter(target, none).last()
lastKnown = current
if (!current.end && current.start != target)  current = undefined
else lastKnown = undefined


[11/14/2023 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing that doesn't work with the above is that if that you will end a last known = unknown in some cases when you should get a real last known


[11/14/2023 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
You would need to end up with  second check:

if (!lastKnown && !current) filter checking only for whereabouts in the past, and take the one where the end date is closed to target, i.e. where end - target is smallest


[11/14/2023 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
that gives you your last known


[11/14/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
Smallest duration is wrong; we want latest start date


[11/14/2023 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right, the trick is to correctly calculate imputed start and imputed end for all entries, and then just do the filter


[11/14/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
right, but actually imputed start is always earliest date and end latest date


[11/14/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
the actual trick is to allow "away" with no end to be found by the filter and then realize (because it has no end) that it isn't a valid "current" location


[11/14/2023 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
for example, a line with:
- { type: home, location: home } 
- { type: away, start = 1535, location: trip }

should return as 
orgin: home
home: home
current: home if target_date < 1535; trip if target_date == 1535, unknown if target_date > 1535
lastknown: home if target_date < 1535, trip if target_date >= 1535


[11/14/2023 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
there is also complication of unknown origin, e.g. 
- born: 1560
- whereabouts: 
  - { type: home, start: 1570, location: home }


[11/14/2023 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
oops


[11/14/2023 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. So the "filter" will return trip.
Then this:

if (!current.end && current.start != target)  current = undefined
else lastKnown = undefined

will fix current.

Then you need to realize that because you have no last known and no current, we need to see if there is a valid date in the past that we could use instead of last known.

So we look for a valid whereabouts in the past and pick the most recent one. home and trip are both valid in the past, but trip is more recent


[11/14/2023 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
Actually ignore that, in that case, we do have a valid last known


[11/14/2023 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
we get in trouble when the home ends and the trip ends


[11/14/2023 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
{ type: home, location: home, end  = 1535 }
{ type: away, start = 1535, end = 1537, location: trip }

in that case in 1538, we have no valid locations left. So what's our last known? We have to go hunt for something in the past


[11/14/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
how would your algorithm handle this if the current date is 1450:

```yaml
born: 
{ type: home, start: 1475, end: 1499, location: first home}
{ type: home, start: 1500, end: , location: home}
```


[11/14/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess just return unknown for everything because there are no valid whereabouts?


[11/14/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
(which should be the correct behavior IMO)


[11/14/2023 5:12 PM] .deciusmus
yup


[11/14/2023 5:12 PM] .deciusmus
the list is empty of valids so everything is unknown


[11/14/2023 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but this (which could be considered a data entry error) will I think trip it up:
```yaml
born: 1450
{ type: home, start: 1475, end: , location: home}
{ type: home, start: , end: , location: origin}
```


[11/14/2023 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
my thinking was:
- pageStart = born or date.min if not born
- imputed_start = start or pageStart if not start
- imputed_end = end or imputed_start if not end and type == away; end or date.max if not end and type == home


[11/14/2023 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
no, you don't need any of that


[11/14/2023 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
the imputed starts and ends are meaningless. you just want to assume if there is no start the start is minDate and if no end the end is maxDate


[11/14/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
in your code I don't think you can have a home with an unknown origin, for example


[11/14/2023 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
then you apply business logic, so to speak, on the result of the match


[11/14/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
how would you specify origin = unknown, home = home


[11/14/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
{ type: home, location: home, start: <any date> }


[11/14/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
or, alternatively, start: <any date after birth>


[11/14/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
puzzling over this


[11/14/2023 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't quite work for origin


[11/14/2023 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
because it won't pick things in the past


[11/14/2023 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
that's actually the key point, different between "current" vs "current or past"


[11/14/2023 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so for current dates (home/current location), you never care about anything except picking the valid date and then converting to unknown for current if !end


[11/14/2023 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/14/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
origin is a bit tricker, you need to know where you were when you were born, or the earliest home location you have recorded if you don't know when you were born


[11/14/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
but actually I think you can just ask for the valid date with target date = born if defined, or date.min if not


[11/14/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, origin isn't really tricky if we assume all origins have start = empty or start = before born


[11/14/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
as long as the start is equal to or before born, origin is the first home with targetDate = born (and if not found, first home with target date = dateMin)


[11/14/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
right but I want to be able to code someone as:
born: 1677
- { type: home, start: 1700, location: Chardon } #start is approx


[11/14/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
they don't have an origin because start: 1700 is in the future


[11/14/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess that would work with your as long as start is equal or before born


[11/14/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
right exactly I want them to be origin unknown


[11/14/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
> I mean, origin isn't really tricky if we assume all origins have start = empty or start = before born

this was confusing


[11/14/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
you can have an unknown origin if you 
a: have the first line of the whereabouts be { type: home, location: }
b: have a defined born date, and no home locations that have start <= born


[11/14/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think this is what you said


[11/14/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Yes


[11/14/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
As an aside, I pushed a bunch of template stuff


[11/14/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
look in _testing\headertests


[11/14/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
has the "max" of each type


[11/14/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
you can see what various bits look like by commenting out parts of the yaml


[11/14/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
```python
def filter_whereabouts(whereabouts, target_date, type=None):
    """

    """

    target_date = clean_date(target_date)

    valid_whereabouts = []

    for entry in whereabouts:
        if type is not None and entry['type'] != type:
            continue
        else:
            #valid type, or no type specified
            start_date = clean_date(entry['start'])
            end_date = clean_date(entry['end'], end=True)
            if start_date <= target_date <= end_date:
                valid_whereabouts.append(entry)


    return valid_whereabouts
```


[11/14/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
writing another function to do the actual selecting of a valid whereabouts


[11/14/2023 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
will need a little tweaking to work for origin and last known I think
and forgot the
```
            start_date = clean_date(entry['start']) if "start" in entry else date.min
            end_date = clean_date(entry['end'], end=True) if "start" in entry else date.max
```


[11/14/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
you need the option of allowing dates in the past


[11/14/2023 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
should a function return "unknown" or None/null


[11/14/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
null


[11/14/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
But actually I implemented in Javascript as well for fun and there are lots of little issues


[11/14/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
Basically the line

{ type: home, location: origin }

causes lots of headaches


[11/14/2023 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
because it is always valid


[11/14/2023 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
right, but that is the desired behavior isn't it?


[11/14/2023 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
whats the correct current location for this:

---
pageTargetDate: 1500
whereabouts:
- { type: home, location: origin }
- { type: home, end: 1499, location: home }
---


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
origin


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
ok


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
that's easy then


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
and whats the right home?


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
also origin?


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
origin, however, is tricky for that one


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess you just take the lexically first


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
so its fine


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
origin is always origin


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] .deciusmus
what's the right answers for this?
---
pageTargetDate: 1501
whereabouts:
- { type: home, location: origin }
- { type: home, start: 1401, end: 1499, location: home }
- { type: away, start: 1500, location: trip }
---


[11/14/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
current: unknown
last know: trip
origin: origin
home: origin


[11/14/2023 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
so basically you expect that we should be setting end:  on the origin line if you want it to not be valid


[11/14/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
not necessarily. 
pageTargetDate: 1501
whereabouts:
- { type: home, location: origin }
- { type: home, start: 1401, end: , location: home }
- { type: away, start: 1500, location: trip }

should report 
origin: origin
home: home
current: unknown
last known: trip


[11/14/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
and:
pageTargetDate: 1501
whereabouts:
- { type: home, location: origin }
- { type: home,  location: home }
- { type: away, start: 1500, location: trip }


[11/14/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
should report the same


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, I don't think we should assume that file order takes precedent over validness, it is only used to break ties


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
So if you set an END date on home, you better also set an END date on origin


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
is the real message


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. 

Guy X came from Chardon, lives in Cleenseau, left Cleenseau in 1719 for parts unknown


[11/14/2023 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, for that person you need to set end on the Chardon line

you need to, at the point you are setting end: 1719 on the Cleenseau home line also need to set an end: xxx on the Chardon line, but it could be end: born if you want

[11/14/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
Guy X came from Chardon, lives in Cleenseau, left Cleenseau in 1719 to go back to Chardon could be:
- { type: home, location: Chardon }
- { type: home, start 1700, end 1719, location: Cleenseau }


[11/14/2023 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
where filter whereabouts is:

```
    get_distance_to_target(item, target) {    
        if (item.logicalEnd.sort < target.sort) { 
            return target.jsDate - item.logicalEnd.jsDate

        else return target.jsDate - item.logicalStart.jsDate
    }

    filterWhereabouts(whereaboutsList, type, target, allowPast) {
        let candidateSet = whereaboutsList.filter(w => (!type || w.type == type) && (w.logicalStart.sort <= target.sort)).filter(w => allowPast || target.sort <= w.logicalEnd.sort)
        let soonestPossible =   Math.min(...candidateSet.map(w =>  this.get_distance_to_target(w, target)))           
        return candidateSet.filter(w =>  this.get_distance_to_target(w, target) == soonestPossible)
    }
```

[11/18/2023 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
Is there a canonical date when Hralgar was trapped?


[11/18/2023 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
only roughly. he was free during the reign of Akaston, and Eudomes both a) trapped him and b) was alive and had to flee during the first plague


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
so that would be roughly 1010-1020 probably?


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
need to double-check Akaston reign end


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
the notes say Apolloyon


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
When the Golden Age ended in civil war, and the [[Omnis Pura]] came to power, things became more difficult, and some time later he was trapped by Eudomes, during Apollyon's reign.


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
is that wrong, should I fix to Akaston


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that's right. i mean Hralgar told you that the emperor he remembered was Akaston, this was the time period he was imaging in the dreamworld in his pre-trapped state


[11/18/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
Apollyon's reign was long so trapped during his reign would make sense


[11/18/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
Is Stormcaller Tower part of: Eastern Dunmar or Dunmar


[11/18/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
And if is it partOf Eastern Dunmar, is eastern Dunmar in turn part of Dunmar?


[11/18/2023 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Eastern Dunmar, and yes, for now

The lack of a descriptor for whereabouts is a little annoying


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
you could just override whereaboutsCurrent


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
ah although that would mess things up for you


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
in 1720


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
why not just trapped, Stormcaller Tower, Eastern Dunmar?


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
that should link probably even though it doesn't do partOf chains


[11/18/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/18/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
actually, you could proably simply a lot going forward with the following:
split loc on comma
if one part, follow partOf chain
if 2 part, link first part only if actual file, follow partof chain
if 3+ part, link first only if actual file, don't follow partof chain


[11/18/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
although that is kind of awkward for traveling to, Place because you have an extraneous comma, but whatever


[11/18/2023 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
probably the right thing to do would be:

if there are no commas in the string, find the first capital letter and use everything after that as the location for linking/part of chains


[11/18/2023 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
so trapped in Stormcaller Tower would be all you had to say

What do you think of Aelvarsk for the highland kingdom region

need to let it sit for a bit


[11/23/2023 3:10 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm much less sold on Elvare or even the need for a name. But I feel like the highland kingdoms area needs a name that isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe highland kingdoms‚Äù


[11/23/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
Two others from chat gpt 

Jarviskar 
Isbrek


[11/24/2023 9:08 AM] rsulfuratus
what are these names for, exactly? e.g., is this geographic region of the sentinel foothills; the cultural designation for the highland kingdom area, something else?


[11/24/2023 9:08 AM] rsulfuratus
taking a page from Scotland, it could make sense to just have: "Sembaran Highlands" and "Sembaran Lowlands"


[11/24/2023 9:20 AM] .deciusmus
The general region of the highland kingdoms. I don‚Äôt think they would call themselves ‚Äúsembaran highlands‚Äù though


[11/24/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess I don't have a good sense of whether this would be a coherent region as seen from within. like, would someone from Breva think of themselves as a person from Breva and from Jarviskar or whatever?


[11/24/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
the drankorians definitely would have called them "the Sembaran highlands"


[11/24/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
of course one complication with that is there is already a highlands region of sembara


[11/24/2023 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
Basically I think originally we called this area ‚ÄúGreater Sembara‚Äù and then we had ‚Äúhighland kingdoms‚Äù and ‚ÄúTyrwingha‚Äù and such as subparts of ‚ÄúGreater Sembara‚Äù


[11/24/2023 9:31 AM] .deciusmus
But as I‚Äôve developed the history I‚Äôm not happy with that naming


[11/24/2023 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
In particular I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúhighland kingdoms‚Äù would ever consider themselves part of ‚ÄúSembara‚Äù


[11/24/2023 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
They have a long and independent history and were only ruled from Sembara for ~100 years around the Great War


[11/24/2023 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
so, I think it depends on where Sembara comes from


[11/24/2023 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
take this scenario, for example


[11/24/2023 9:35 AM] .deciusmus
Well, I created the Duchy of Sembara and the river Semb as a source for the name of the kingdom


[11/24/2023 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
river names often stick around for a long time, so perhaps the Drankorians came and the local people said the river was the Semb, and so in the Drankorian empire these were known as the Sembaran provinces


[11/24/2023 9:36 AM] .deciusmus
Right, the river name is probably ancient


[11/24/2023 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
in Drankorian geography, Sembaran would refer to the entire Semb rivershed, basically everything from the Sentinels to the Green Sea, south of the Volta and north of the hills


[11/24/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
the duchy of Sembara takes its name from this


[11/24/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
the parallel is Great Britain


[11/24/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
Although Great Britain is a counter example to me. Sembara = England, Tyrwingha = wales, highland kingdoms = Scotland


[11/24/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
but the island is called Great Britain


[11/24/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
which derives from latin


[11/24/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
and if the Angles hadn't moved in between the end of the roman empire and the growth of the english kingdoms, England very likely could just be Britain


[11/24/2023 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
I guess there is no reason you couldn‚Äôt have had Britain as the name of the English kingdom


[11/24/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
since England = land of the Angles and Britain = land of the britons


[11/24/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
which isn't to say that a name for "Scotland" = highland kingdoms isn't worth having


[11/24/2023 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
but probably it should be "land of the X"


[11/24/2023 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure have a name for the people who live there


[11/24/2023 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
it is actually probably useful to develop names for all the various subcultures since that makes naming regions a lot easier, since some many  names in the real world are just "land of the X"


[11/24/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
this is what I was trying to do with Vostok and Skaehem (which are land of the Vos and land of the Skaer)


[11/24/2023 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
You‚Äôve slightly convinced me though that Sembara is actually the appropriate name. 

The derivation would be:
Drankorians appear and are told basically ‚Äúwe are the people of the Semb river valley, ie the Sembarans‚Äù (at the time the drankorians arrived the highland/lowland distinction was fairly minimal)

They don‚Äôt conquer the highlands, but the provinces are called Sembaran provinces (ala ‚ÄúGaulish or British provinces‚Äù)

The highlanders themselves continue to refer to themselves as ‚Äúsembaran‚Äú or ‚Äúfree sembarans‚Äù or ‚Äúhighland sembarans‚Äù

And today there is just the Sembaran lowlands and the Sembaran highlands


[11/24/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
On the other hand, it probably is pretty reasonable for the sembaran highlanders to have developed a new name for themselves, or linguistic change to have happened differently, etc


[11/24/2023 9:50 AM] .deciusmus
Today (1720/1750) it seems to me the four highland kingdoms would have much more in common with each other than with sembara


[11/24/2023 9:54 AM] .deciusmus
All *that* said, for worldbuilding/in game reference purposes, it seems nicer to have a word for the highland kingdoms as I find it unsatisifying to refer to the language as "highlander" and so on. And there is an actual region of the kingdom of Sembara that is called the Sembaran Highlands as well. In the real world things end up with confusing names all the time, but I'd prefer to not have this particular situation be confusing


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] .deciusmus
So if we can come up with a good name for the "land where the people of Lavnoch, Breva, Ardlas, and Zovcka live" it probably makes sense


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
i think a name for the people is most useful


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
then you'd just have X-land


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
and also a name for the language


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, agreed


[11/24/2023 10:11 AM] .deciusmus
On a totally different topic, I am refactoring the Javascript stuff pretty significantly


[11/24/2023 10:11 AM] .deciusmus
I'm moving towards an architecture where there is a string formatter class that takes strings in the form of:

"Some data <token:format>"

and applies the format


[11/24/2023 10:12 AM] .deciusmus
This is designed to centralize all formatting of locations and dates so that we can more easily add fancy features (like approximate dates or location slices)


[11/24/2023 10:12 AM] .deciusmus
It also makes it much easier to use pieces of frontmatter logic in dataview queries, i.e. to allow for things like the secondary line or pronunciation or pronouns in a "members of" table


[11/24/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
i am hopefully going to push a new taeglarverse build today with session 82 session notes, fwiw


[11/24/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
a string formatter makes a lot of sense and will also be worth implementing in python (the more things that can be moved to classes with clearly defined functions the simpler the translation is in my experience)


[11/24/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
but it might be a while before I get to it


[11/24/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
It shouldn't matter a ton, except that python won't have access to certain new features, i.e. if we add splices to loc


[11/24/2023 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
The basic idea is that the DV scripts (like get_pageDatedValue, get_Whereabouts) are for picking a format string


[11/24/2023 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
I'm still trying to figure out exactly the best solution to your whereabouts problem


[11/24/2023 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
it seems like allowing specific display overrides on particular whereabouts lines (or campaignInfo lines) should be fairly easy, you just check if whereabout.displayDefaults exists and then if it does just use your merge code to create a new format string, in buildFormattedLocationString


[11/24/2023 10:32 AM] .deciusmus
the challenge for whereabouts is you don't know if the whereabouts line is going to be a current location or a last known location or a home location


[11/24/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
I need to go back and read your example, but I am not sure if you need to know the usage type of the whereabout to know what to put in the string


[11/24/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
I'm also a bit nervous about slicing  because it is susceptible to unpredictable changes if you reorganize a region or something


[11/24/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
Like, if I added a "Greater Sembara" region everything that sliced that was rooted back at Sembara could get weird.


[11/24/2023 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
it wouldn't change anything more than already


[11/24/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
i wasn't thinking of arbitrary slices


[11/24/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
just continuous slices


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
so for location chain a-b-c-d-e-f, you can pick to display b-c-d instead of a-b-c


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
not you can pick a-c-f


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
so a start + count only, not arbitrary ranges


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
i agree arbitrary ranges get wonky


[11/24/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
the use case is really for something like buliding a full whereabouts for delwath


[11/24/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
you'd want a good chunk of that time to be in "Dunmar Fellowship"


[11/24/2023 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
but you don't (necessarily) want the location to be "Dunmar Fellowship, Vindristjarna, Vetta"


[11/24/2023 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
you might prefer: "Vetta, Skaer Islands, Western Green Sea"


[11/24/2023 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus
or for a lot of my chardonian adventurers, if i build a full whereabouts, I don't want to copy and past, I want a whereabouts container


[11/24/2023 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
right, so it is mostly about skipping to the "actual" location


[11/24/2023 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/24/2023 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
Would it make more sense to have a filter for only showing actual location pieces?


[11/24/2023 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
<loc:p> = location with places only


[11/24/2023 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that might be easier


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
but, you'd still want that to be applied per-whereabouts


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., for antonia, I don't want to skip over Mirror of Soul Trapping


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
right, but I actually think the "per whereabouts" is just the formatter


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
but do probably want to skip over "Kadmos Team"


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. you do not want to say: "Currently in: <loc:p>"


[11/24/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
you want to just say:

{ type: away, location: Dunmar Fellowship, format: p }


[11/24/2023 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
ah yes, that would work


[11/24/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
What you really want is a selector for what type of things to show


[11/24/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
format: pio shows places, organizations, and items is the default


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
but it is also useful to adjust the location size by whereabout as well


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
right


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
that still works


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
so you could do format: 10p


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
means 10 sizes, places only


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
or format 10ip means 10 pieces items and places only


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
format 10 means 10 pieces, items, places, and organizations


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
I'd actually prefer to have an exclude


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
maybe o means exclude organizations, i means exclude items, etc


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
p would mean exclude people


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
the one reason to still do slices, although maybe there is a better solution, is i started putting the whereabouts of some people as, e.g., an inn, so that the Met by Party line would show the specific meeting location


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but I don't necessarily like the actual location of the person to be the inn


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
right you'd like to allow subtypes of places


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
but that gets confusing to represent in single characters


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. exclude place/inn


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
but maybe a slice is better for that


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
because you know it is always the first one


[11/24/2023 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
probably p = exclude places, i= exclude items, o = exclude organizations, f = exclude first would be sufficient


[11/24/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
you might also want an exclude person


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I would use p for exclude person


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure you'd ever want to exclude places, really


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
and l for exclude places


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
maybe in a whereabout of an item


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
sure if you just want to track the owner/maker


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
same with organizations


[11/24/2023 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
org and item whereabouts lines use loc:1 often


[11/24/2023 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
to avoid showing the full details


[11/24/2023 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
but loc:l to exclude locations works better


[11/24/2023 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
you could also use casing, i.e. L P O I could mean include only  locations people organizations items


[11/24/2023 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
and F


[11/24/2023 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
actually if you did that plus R r for regions


[11/24/2023 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
You could probably get rid of the counting entirely, i.e. you could say:

R = include regions only; r = exclude regions (i.e. places with typeOf region)
L = include locations only; l = exclude locations
P = include people only; p = exclude people
I = include items only; p = exclude items
F = include first step only; f = exclude first step
O = include organizations only; o = exclude organizations


[11/24/2023 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
so this would be very easy to do in python, you just record the location chain as a list of dicts and then you can use a lamba function to filter however you want, it is like one line of code


[11/24/2023 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
but you want to split the get_location_from_part_of into two functions


[11/24/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
one that builds the chain, one that formats the array once you have it


[11/24/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure the javascript approach


[11/24/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
Haven't looked but it isn't hard


[11/24/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
when formatting a whereabout which wins? the <loc:xxx> or the inside the whereabout version?


[11/24/2023 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
I guess the inside the whereabout one


[11/24/2023 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
presumably it has to be the inside the whereabouts


[11/24/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. if you had:

whereaboutsCurrent: "Based in: <loc:pi>"

and then a whereabout like:

{ type: , location: , format: fp }

presumably you want to end up formatting using fp not pi


[11/24/2023 11:01 AM] .deciusmus
There is some complexity about whether you follow whereabouts or partof if you have both


[11/24/2023 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
I think you should always follow whereabouts if it exists


[11/24/2023 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
conceptually, partOf: <loc> for places is just shorthand for whereabouts: {type: home, location: <loc>}


[11/24/2023 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus
since it (almost). never makes sense for a place to have a whereabouts line


[11/24/2023 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus
although imagine an inn that is teleported from Chardon to Tollen


[11/24/2023 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
I think the end state should be:
* A format string logic as per the above
* A set of different replacements that represent different things you might care about

> <current:format>:  this represents the current location of an item and uses the "current" whereabout as of the current fantasy date. it follows current whereabouts if current exists, but if current doesn't exist on the first item it uses last known instead. When using last know if follows the chain using the last known's date, rather than the current date. If a page further up the chain doesn't have current, it terminates with unknown unless the page has a partOf

> <onlycurrent:format> : this represents the current location of an item and uses the "current" whereabout as of the current fantasy date. it follows current whereabouts up the chain or partofs if there is no current whereabout. Unlike current it never uses last known and will report Unknown if there is no current

> <partof:format>: this represents what the thing is part of. it never looks at whereabouts and can be used to present something other than a location, i.e. an organization is part of a larger organization or a phasing stone is part of Vindistraja

> <origin:format>: this is the same as current but when following the chain it uses the page creation date, not the current date

> <home:format>: this follows home whereabouts if they exist, otherwise partof. It won't follow current whereabouts (i.e. an away whereabout)


[11/24/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
The reason to distinguish partof and current is because an organization could have both


[11/24/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
or an item could have both


[11/24/2023 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus
but if you are following a location chain you always want the whereabouts


[11/24/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
right but you might want to follow the partOf chain instead


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] rsulfuratus
but only for a place


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] .deciusmus
or an organization or item


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] .deciusmus
or even a person


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] rsulfuratus
but when would you want to follow the partOf for an item?


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] .deciusmus
an item on Vindistraja


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
you might want the header line to be:

(<rarity> <etc> <partof:I>)


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
so it would be (a rare magical phasing stone on Vindistraja)


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, I guess that is a bit weird


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
because you would probably just use whereabouts


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
The better use case is organizations


[11/24/2023 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/24/2023 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
the Cleenseau Garrison is partOf: Dunfry Regiment and whereabouts: Cleenseau


[11/24/2023 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
you then want to show both:

Parent Organization: <partof>
Based in: <home>


[11/24/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm only talking about what you do when you are building a location chain


[11/24/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., if a person has Cleenseau Garrison as their whereabouts


[11/24/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
conceptually, that means, "this person is where the Cleenseau Garrison is"


[11/24/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
right but I think you want to distinguish different bits


[11/24/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
see the spec above


[11/24/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
<current:x> means "current location" following the current whereabouts if there are any whereabouts and partof only if there are not


[11/24/2023 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
your spec seems too complicated to me but maybe i'm missing something


[11/24/2023 11:22 AM] rsulfuratus
my take is whereabouts are a super useful way to speed up notetaking once you get using them, because many items and people move around in clumps, so you just need to track the clump and then you can put the whereabouts of the things in the clump as "clump"


[11/24/2023 11:22 AM] rsulfuratus
but to make this sensible requires tweaking display a bit


[11/24/2023 11:22 AM] .deciusmus
Right, my goal is slightly different and maybe not clear


[11/24/2023 11:22 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not talking about formatting the whereabouts line itself or rules on the whereabouts line


[11/24/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
I'm talking about trying to generalize the formatting so you can make a data view table like:

column 1 = "<typeof>, <pronouns>"
column 2 = "<current>


[11/24/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
and that works but you could also add a column 3

column 3 = "<partof:1>"


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
and have it all mean something


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
ah, i see


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
for the whereabouts line itself, you'd just have {format:x}


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
so, i think i would simplify that, though


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
then the "whereaboutsCurrent" in the display defaults would be "Currently in: <current>"


[11/24/2023 11:25 AM] rsulfuratus
I actually kind of think we should replace partOf: x with whereabouts: x in places


[11/24/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, arguably partOf doesn't need to exist for anything


[11/24/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
for organizations it is affiliations


[11/24/2023 11:26 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. the Cleenseau garrison is not "part of" the Dunfry regiment, it is affliated with and has a primary affiiation typeof set correctly


[11/24/2023 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
conceptually leaderOf is not really meaningful either


[11/24/2023 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think there are really just 2 relationships:
whereabouts and affiliations


[11/24/2023 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
so, i would argue you are overgeneralizing a little bit


[11/24/2023 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
whereabouts only ever means one thing: where is this in space


[11/24/2023 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
but affiliations gets complicated if it has to track a large number of different relationships


[11/24/2023 11:29 AM] .deciusmus
isn't it just

{ title: , thing: , start:, end:, isLeader: }


[11/24/2023 11:29 AM] .deciusmus
leaderOf is definitely being misused for "navigator of the x"


[11/24/2023 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, that is a display hack


[11/24/2023 11:29 AM] .deciusmus
entirely because you can't set the title of an affliation


[11/24/2023 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
but yeah I think generalizing the leaderOf structure could work


[11/24/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think "affiliation" just means:

this specific creature or group of creatures is associated with this other group of creatures


[11/24/2023 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
it makes dataview queries a bit hairer


[11/24/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
it does


[11/24/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
but whereabouts: x instead of partof: x has the same problem


[11/24/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
basically it requires mostly using javascript helpers


[11/24/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
and actually it works fine


[11/24/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
as long as you don't care about dates


[11/24/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. this query works

table from #person where contains(affiliations, "Drankor") or contains(affiliations.org, "Drankor")


[11/24/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
in the case where I have one page with

affiliations: [ Drankor ]

and another page with

affiliations: [ {org: Drankor }]


[11/24/2023 11:35 AM] .deciusmus
this also works:

table from #person where contains(whereabouts, "Cleenseau") or contains(whereabouts.location, "Cleenseau")


[11/24/2023 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah i just tested the same thing


[11/24/2023 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
It just ignores the types and dates; so you end up with everything that has ever been somewhere (or anything that has ever been affiliated with something)


[11/24/2023 11:37 AM] .deciusmus
but I actually think i.e. for checking the part of chains of places, its totally fine to just ignore that


[11/24/2023 11:37 AM] .deciusmus
the teleporting inn appears in both Chardon and Tollen's list - who cares?


[11/24/2023 11:37 AM] .deciusmus
and if you want perfect accuracy there is always javascript helpers


[11/24/2023 11:38 AM] .deciusmus
but collapsing leaderOf / partOf for organizations / affliations into one thing actually is appealing from a simplification standpoint


[11/24/2023 11:38 AM] .deciusmus
You end up getting the same display as before, with just "Member" being the default title for affiliations with no title


[11/24/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
but it lets you specify dates for affliations if you want


[11/24/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. Antonia when she becomes a key NPC in the far northern 1760s campaign, could have

affiliation: [ {org: The Cleansed, start: xxx, end: yyy }]


[11/24/2023 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
that is nice


[11/24/2023 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
i think instead of just isLeader, you need  "leader of" and "subordinate to" relationships


[11/24/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
Right that gets into the ruledBy stuff I was trying to avoid


[11/24/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for "Kadmos Team" org, you have:
- affiliated with Society of the Open Scroll
- ruled by The Cleansed


[11/24/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
I think a type: on affiliation that currently supports ‚Äúnone‚Äù or ‚Äúleader‚Äù is probably a good starting spot


[11/24/2023 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/24/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
And see where it goes


[11/24/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
Anyway afk for a bit. Will revisit some of this later


[11/24/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm actually


[11/24/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
there are really three display options:
halfling, she/her, of the AFF1
---
Queen of AFF2
---
Member of: AFF3


[11/24/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
I think you want those to be tracked in the affiliation object


[11/24/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
so:
type = primary, leader, none


[11/24/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
that works fine for people, but using affliations to track organizational relationships also implies a partOf


[11/24/2023 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus
that is, I might want the Voltara Legion to be:
Voltara Legion
a garrison in the Chardonian Army
Based In: Voltara


[11/24/2023 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but I don't want the Chardonian Army to be:
Leader of Voltara Garrison, Myraeni Garrison, Chardon Garrison, Chasa Garrison, Valandros Garrison, etc, etc


[11/24/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe part of actually does make sense for orgs


[11/24/2023 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
It could be unitOf instead


[11/24/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
so I think minimally you want:
- primary (implies of XXX in the secondary info line)
- leader (implies Leader of XXX in separate lie)
- partof (imples A <typeof> in XXX in separate line)
- none (implies Member Of: XXX)


[11/24/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Ah you are suggesting using it as affiliation type


[11/24/2023 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus
whether those are all combined into a single affiliations line or not i think is more about ease of programming or ease of querying


[11/24/2023 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus
but I think at least in the notes I've worked on / am thinking about, those are the four types of affiliation relationships that should be separately tracked/displayed


[11/24/2023 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
honestly having it all in one affiliations object would be way simpler for primary affiliations, which currently were quite annoying for the halflings because I had to make a stub note for every halfling family with typeOf: family


[11/24/2023 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
so i think i'd lean towards putting everything as an affiliation type, which is also more easily extensible if we think of another relationships that needs to be captured (maybe feudal relationships for example)


[11/24/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
Right so I think getting rid of leader of and primary affiliation and just having a type line of ‚Äúprimary‚Äù | ‚Äúleader‚Äù | ‚Äúmember‚Äù

Last is the default. 

Makes sense


[11/24/2023 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
Of course if the primary affiliation is dated then it has to be dynamic but I suppose that is rare


[11/24/2023 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
Part of is less clear. Need a bit of thought. 
All affiliations would support the dates and title features of leader of


[11/24/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
Display logic and allow for either

Non primary affiliations 
Primary affiliations
All affiliations


[11/24/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
Currently leader would be unused except for 

- leader title defaults to page title


[11/24/2023 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
Let me mess around with this a bit later today


[11/24/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
I want to finish the string format refactor first. But I might implement the affiliation stuff before the whereabouts format stuff

gets all the notes that link to a specific page, with status info. could probably be neater in javascript


[11/24/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but is great for prioritizing updating notes that are linked to session notes


[11/24/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôve made some progress on refactor. 

Basically all string display and composition is based on the new string formatter class.


[11/24/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
It takes -dozen special <xxx> strings plus will fall back to just looking at metadata


[11/24/2023 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
The special ones are:
- current: get the current whereabouts for this page and follow the chain using the ‚Äúnow‚Äù date
- ‚Äúhome‚Äù currently same as current except it starts from home 
- ‚Äúorigin‚Äù starts are origin and follows chain at page creation date or 0001 if there is no page creation date
- lastknown: starts with last known and follows at ‚Äúend date‚Äù of last known


[11/24/2023 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
Logically I‚Äôm planning on getting rid of part of. These chain following functions will only follow whereabouts


[11/24/2023 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
For back compat a page with type = place, partOf set, no whereabouts will act like a single whereabouts with the part of value


[11/24/2023 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
The get_xxx methods then are just about selecting the right format string


[11/24/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
do you think it is worth keeping the "primary affiliation" stuff for backwards compat or is it fine to have to update all the pages to have

affiliations: [ {org: Goodbarrels, type: primary}] if you want Of xxx to appear?


[11/24/2023 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
its fine to not retain backwards compatibility. its a static line anyway


[11/24/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
Any opinion on the "org" bit?


[11/24/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't want to use affiliation as it is long to type


[11/24/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
currently supporting either

{ org: xxx }

or

{ place: xxx }

where 

{ place: xxx } is shorthand for { place:xxx, type: leader }


[11/24/2023 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
org is fine


[11/24/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
I assume you don't really need to see:

Properitor of The Salty Pig, Fiskirk, Tollen


[11/24/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
Or do you want that?


[11/24/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't think so


[11/24/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
it is a lot easier to not have that for now


[11/24/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
I'm about to push a major rewrite of the Javascript to a branch


[11/24/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm about to push session notes


[11/24/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
There are likely some bugs but it is a lot more flexible


[11/24/2023 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
I'll try to write a bit of a guide


[11/24/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
adding some more notes to test cases (ones that use the new features and work) is almost as useful


[11/24/2023 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
true


[11/24/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
A lot of it is magic formatting strings:

     // t: title case; s: lower case, u: initial upper case
        // a: indefinite article, A: indefinite article if first
        // n: never link, y: always link


[11/24/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
so you can do stuff like (<ancestry:A> <typeof:A)

and it will get you

a Sembaran human
or
a human

but not

a a human or a Sembaran a human


[11/24/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
Affiliations are also no longer static


[11/24/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
because they are normalized with regnal stuff


[11/24/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have any examples of complex intercrossing whereabouts chains?


[11/24/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
Or did you not commit them because they didn't really work?


[11/25/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
garret tealeaf would be a good example, if you built a tealeaf whereabouts and a charmhearts whereabouts he could be tealeaf -> lair -> dufr -> charmhearts. but i didn't abstract out anyones whereabouts yet


[11/25/2023 9:16 AM] rsulfuratus
was going to use it for the various chardonian adventures when i get a chance.


[11/25/2023 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
I'll play with that. You haven't published session 81 notes yet have you?


[11/25/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
no, but they are pushed


[11/25/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
ah session 81 yes, not session 82


[11/25/2023 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
I kinda want to merge my changes relatively soon to reduce conflicts but it might cause some publish challenges for a bit until we sort out the bugs


[11/25/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm going to rebuild website in next 30 minutes


[11/25/2023 10:00 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed all changes i will make before website build, so feel free to merge


[11/25/2023 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
Have you had a chance to look at the changes? The big one is that <loc> is no longer valid and you can use <current> <home> <origin> or <lastknown>


[11/25/2023 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus
no, i've been working on content


[11/25/2023 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
Also partOf on places is treated same as whereabouts


[11/25/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
whereas "part of" is still meaningful for organizations


[11/25/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
so i.e. the Dunfry Regiment can be partOf Army of the West and whereabouts: Dunfry


[11/25/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
whereabouts Dunfry (if the page says "partOf Barony of Dunfry) is treated as if it said whereabouts: Barony of Dunfry


[11/26/2023 9:17 AM] rsulfuratus
how do you control location partOf depth now? e.g. if you had <loc:2> before


[11/26/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
Do you mean part of? Usually you want current


[11/26/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
Which works with current:2 as before


[11/26/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
Part of is now only for organizations


[11/26/2023 9:18 AM] rsulfuratus
current:2 doesn't do anything


[11/26/2023 9:19 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm it should


[11/26/2023 9:19 AM] rsulfuratus
ah nevermind


[11/26/2023 9:19 AM] rsulfuratus
typo


[11/26/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
a few comments after fiddling for a bit:
1. it would be great to move the default required object defined on line 177 of nameManager to metadata.json. it is nice to see all the defaults in one place.


[11/26/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
2. i might also change a few of the defaults, minimally I'd set all the locations back to 3 in most cases, and i think "halfling (he/him), of the Charmhearts" generally looks better than "a halfling, he/him of the Charmhearts" -- but this is pretty minor. i might also make some of the affiliation defaults shorter (like not put age/length when there are start/end dates). generally i'd probably default to making the header shorter and more compact, and then use overrides to make it longer when needed


[11/26/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
3. the biggest remaining QoL improvement would be to allow format overrides per line in affiliation and campaignInfo


[11/26/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if I have `campaign: dufr, person: Wellby, date: 1730, type: met`


[11/26/2023 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
I want to be able to generate:
`Met by Wellby around DR 1730 at The Singing Fox, in Fairgate Outer, the Free City of Tollen`


[11/26/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
For #2 feel free to change defaults whereever you want, I'm not committed to particular defaults


[11/26/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
For #1, on my list


[11/26/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
But the main reason I did it the way I did is it is pain when debugging to have it in metadata.json as you have to remember to reload the metadata which I often forget to do


[11/26/2023 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
something like:
`format: <type> by <person> around <start> at <current:F> in <current:f2>`


[11/26/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
it would be fairly trivial to add overrides to affliation and campaign info


[11/26/2023 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus
that would also allow something like different defaults for leaders and non-leaders for affiliations


[11/26/2023 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. place: xxx could be shorthand for org: place, type: leader, format: xxxx


[11/26/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
the tricky bit I think is getting the order of operations right


[11/26/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if you have:
`{type: home, location: The Singing Fox, format: fr}`


[11/26/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
and also `<current:F>` in your campaignInfo format


[11/26/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
the campaignInfo should override the whereabouts format string


[11/26/2023 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
when you determine a format string the order should be something like:
required defaults < type defaults < page defaults < whereabouts format string < campaign info format string / affiliation format string


[11/26/2023 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
the presumption is that if you are adding a specific override string for a campaignInfo line, you know what it should generate and you wantt to have a specific, exact format


[11/26/2023 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
That last bit is hardest


[11/26/2023 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
because the string format doesn't know where the format string is coming from


[11/26/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
i think the way to do it is just have the string formatter trust the string it is passed and not try to update it


[11/26/2023 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
but it needs to for whereabouts


[11/26/2023 10:31 AM] .deciusmus
anyway, will think about it


[11/26/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
architecturally, the way I would do this in python is try to build a data object for each page that contained everything - all possible locations, all possible affiliations, all format strings. but, i think that doesn't make sense for the javascript functions which need to work on continually updated pages instead of a fixed directory of static text


[11/26/2023 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
but i have the feeling that 1300 lines of code is more than we need for what we are trying to do and there is probably a clever way to simpilfy things that would also make some of this easier


[11/26/2023 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm just not sure what it is yet


[11/26/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a spec, fyi


[11/26/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
or more accurately, documentation


[11/26/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
The problem is that the format hierarchies are a bit of a pain here. The simplest would be to have something like ! mean ‚Äúthis wins‚Äù


[11/26/2023 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
So if you have a format string of !f in the party line it wins over the whereabouts format


[11/26/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
That could be useful in general if you wanted a generic table to always show something


[11/26/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/26/2023 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not going to spend a ton of time on this today as I've got other things to do but i am currently trying to just make sure I understand all the new code in case I want to try to work on python implementation

{Reactions}
üëç

[11/26/2023 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
Makes sense. We are going out hiking today so also not spending much time on it but might implement the ! rule as discussed above. The key for python is to just reimplement the string formatter I think. The get_xxx functions are really simple now


[11/26/2023 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
assume you are out hiking, i am switching between work work and going over code. opening issues for each class to track questions/potential refactors/potential bugs


[11/26/2023 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
not going to edit any code at the moment


[11/26/2023 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
okay lied about not editing code, pushed some edits to code_cleanup branch


[11/26/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
so I think you are not quite right about how whereabouts should work...  I'm leaving some comments on the github issue


[11/26/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
but I do think that last known should contain the current, i.e. last known is never undefined


[11/26/2023 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
look at the code in code_cleanup, it is way shorter and so far displays identical things, except fixes the bug in Apollyon where it doesn't display a last known location


[11/26/2023 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i had to change the part of to check if current location is unknown instead of exists


[11/26/2023 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so far the only difference is that if you have a home but not an origin, you get "Origin unknown" text, which I like, but would be easy to remove either via code or a format string


[11/26/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
I am not sure I agree that causing all the locations to exist with "unknowns" is better


[11/26/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
*all the whereabouts


[11/26/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
why not?


[11/26/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
it removes context - you can't decide things based on whether it exists or not


[11/26/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe there are not any cases you care, but I think origin is at least one of them


[11/26/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
You need some mechanism to conditionally display origin as unknown or not unknown


[11/26/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it is clearer as a property of the page:


[11/26/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so, what I wanted to eventually do was have "display this if it is unknown" be a format string


[11/26/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. I want to be able to distinguish between "this person's origin is canonically unknown" vs "no thoughts on origin"


[11/26/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
but it shouldn't be a display string


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I don't see those as being any different


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
I think its nicer to add the unknown whereabout than add the display string


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
although I suppose it depends on where you come down on the default


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
if you think the default should be everyone has an unknown origin, if their home has a start date, I guess that makes sense


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the use case for a format string is to get:
Current Location: the Emerald Song, unknown


[11/26/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
but is that an origin?


[11/26/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
that is a home or current whereabout, right?


[11/26/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, the location chain always follows current


[11/26/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, more accurately, that is an argument for having the whereabout have a defined unknown location


[11/26/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
But it doesn't have to be so for home and origin, necessarily


[11/26/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but back to the origin unknown case, I consider:
- {type: home, start: 1725, location:  Tollen } 
to mean that yes, canonically, the origin is unknown


[11/26/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
the only way you can ever have an unknown origin is to have no known location at birth, which can only arise if you intentionally make it so that there is no known origin at birth


[11/26/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
right although you broke that case I think in your refactor


[11/26/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
But, yes, I see the point. The setting of a start date on home implies unknown origin


[11/26/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
actually nevermind it does work


[11/26/2023 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway have to start dinner more in a bit though


[11/26/2023 6:26 PM] .deciusmus
So I thought about this some more when I was making dinner (now in the oven) and I think the basic concern is that the codebase is getting littered with "if location == "unknown"" which would be much clearer if the location was just undefined


[11/26/2023 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
That is, I would:

(a) change logic so that last known is returned always (if there is either a last known or a current)
(b) change logic so that current, lastknown, etc always are returned, but the location is undefined, if it isn't known
(c) change follow logic for last known so it follows at the last known date only if it is in the past, current date otherwise
(d) change string formatter so that last known doesn't fall back to current


[11/26/2023 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
Then I would add the following strings to metadata.json

whereaboutsOriginUnknown - used if the origin is not known
whereaboutsCurrentUnknown - used if the current is not known
whereaboutsHomeUnknown - used if the home is not known
whereaboutsLastKnownUnknown - used if the last known is not known

and remove the whereaboutsUnknown


[11/26/2023 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
Then, the get_Whereabouts logic adds the unknown case into the format string generation, i.e. so the "home" string is either past/unknown/etc


[11/26/2023 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
see, I have the exact opposite opinion. I think that if you want to filter unknown locations, you should explicitly say so in the code


[11/26/2023 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
so far I've only had to add one single filter, with the get location from parts code


[11/26/2023 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
everything else works exactly as it is, because the only time it matters if a location is unknown is for display


[11/26/2023 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
internally, an undefined location is just an unknown location


[11/26/2023 6:31 PM] .deciusmus
see, I disagree


[11/26/2023 6:32 PM] .deciusmus
and you have special cases in the get_whereabouts as well


[11/26/2023 6:32 PM] rsulfuratus
but that is where you should have special cases


[11/26/2023 6:32 PM] rsulfuratus
part of the issue is that java and python have very different ideas about what undefined means


[11/26/2023 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
filtering on whereabouts.location == "Unknown" works


[11/26/2023 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, technically this should be null not undefined


[11/26/2023 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
I just didn't know the different when I starting writing the code


[11/26/2023 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
but filtering on !whereabouts.location works better


[11/26/2023 6:34 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure what use case you are envisioning


[11/26/2023 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
filtering on location being falsey requires that:
a) we add special handling for unknown locations, because by default they get removed
b) I need to carefully debug python code because falsey is not defined the same way in python and java


[11/26/2023 6:35 PM] .deciusmus
To me, writing code like:

if (home.location == "Unknown") formatStr = whereaboutsUnknownHome

is really messy


[11/26/2023 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is telling me expiclity what the code is trying to do


[11/26/2023 6:36 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure where you are envisioning (a), I guess is the problem


[11/26/2023 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
it also means that you get the same results for { type: away, location: Unknown } and { type: away } which to me is the desired behavior


[11/26/2023 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
if I want to generate a table in dataviewjs with all items without defined makers, for example


[11/26/2023 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
or without defined Owners


[11/26/2023 6:38 PM] .deciusmus
sure, but 

something like:

where(f => !util.gw(f).origin.location)

is much more pleasant to read than

where(f => util.gw(f).origin.location == "Unknown")


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
First, just because it is shorter, so it is nicer


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
Second, because the "unknown" logic elides the difference between "not defined" and "defined as not known"


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
So I think the second point is our fundamental disagreement


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I want to elide that difference


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
Why?

If I am doing data cleanup, I don't want to be bothered with the stuff someone has explicitly defined as unkown


[11/26/2023 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure the use case you want them to be the same, actually


[11/26/2023 6:43 PM] .deciusmus
If I am creating a table of all of the people either in or based in a place, I might do something like:

where(f => util.inOrBasedInLoc(f, "Cleenseau")
map(f => [util.s(f, "<name>"), util.s(f, "<current:1>")]


[11/26/2023 6:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so one alternative that might work for both of us is to keep the idea of an unknown whereabout, but just have location = null for unknown whereabouts


[11/26/2023 6:43 PM] .deciusmus
That was my proposal above!


[11/26/2023 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
üôÇ


[11/26/2023 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
oh I thought you were saying whereabout.origin = null


[11/26/2023 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
not whereabout.origin.location = null


[11/26/2023 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
no, whereabouts.origin.location


[11/26/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
I am proposing:
(a) whereabout with no location represents the canonical "undefined" location
(b) if you want to "force" the whereabout to appear as "defined", you can set the location to something like "unknown" or "somewhere in Taelgar" or "drifting on the winds"


[11/26/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
which is a "defined-undefined"


[11/26/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
and is treated just like any other place


[11/26/2023 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
it does make the get_Whereabouts logic a little more complex but I think that is manageable


[11/26/2023 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think it makes it simpler


[11/26/2023 6:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I do not like at all needing to write " type: home, location: unknown" to force an unknown origin, though, that is just pointless extra typing


[11/26/2023 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
You introduce a "unknown" format string for each type


[11/26/2023 6:48 PM] rsulfuratus
originally I was going to propose exactly that - you have a pastKnown, pastUnknown, currentKnown, and currentUnknown for each type


[11/26/2023 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
So the idea is:

this line:

```originString = StringFormatter.getFormattedString(displayDefaults.whereaboutsOrigin, file, pageYear)```

becomes

```originString = StringFormatter.getFormattedString(origin.location? displayDefaults.whereaboutsOrigin : displayDefaults.whereaboutsOriginUnknown, file, pageYear)```


[11/26/2023 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think you need all that complexity


[11/26/2023 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
no one cares about past vs current unknown


[11/26/2023 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
Then, if you want to see "origin: unknown" you just set the display default


[11/26/2023 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
Or rather, the default display default would be Origin: Unknown, if we decided


[11/26/2023 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
whichever way


[11/26/2023 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
can you think of an example page where a) origin is unknown and b) you don't want unknown origin to be displayed?


[11/26/2023 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, we are about to eat dinner


[11/26/2023 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
i'll think about it a bit


[11/26/2023 6:50 PM] .deciusmus
No


[11/26/2023 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
treating unknown as special locations feels a bit more complicated to me but I need to think about it


[11/26/2023 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, so if we use null for unknown locations, what should happen in each of these cases:
- { type: away, location: unknown}
- { type: away, location: ""}
- { type: away, location: }
- { type: away }


[11/26/2023 7:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and I guess one could add for fun:
- {type: away, location: null }
- {type: away, location: undefined }


[11/26/2023 7:16 PM] rsulfuratus
and also, should these be treated the same or different:
- {type: home, end: 1000 }
- {type: home, location: home1 }

vs

- {type: home, start: 1001, location: home1 }


[11/26/2023 7:16 PM] rsulfuratus
(presuming born date is < 1000 or missing)


[11/26/2023 7:17 PM] .deciusmus
Location: unknown implies the string ‚Äúunknown‚Äù right?


[11/26/2023 7:19 PM] .deciusmus
I think the rule is simpler than I made it sound


[11/26/2023 7:19 PM] .deciusmus
Stringformatter.getFormattedString("<current>") already returns "Unknown" if there is no current whereabout


[11/26/2023 7:19 PM] .deciusmus
so the rule for get_whereabouts is:

if (home.location == origin.location) {
     output home
} else {
    output origin
    output home
}

If (current.location != home.location) {
if (current.location == lastknown.location) {
         output current
} else i{
         output current
          output last known
}
}


[11/26/2023 7:22 PM] rsulfuratus
that is not quite right, because if current is unknown and home is unknown you still want to output current


[11/26/2023 7:22 PM] .deciusmus
right I guess you want something like:

if (home.location && home.location != current.location)


[11/26/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but this implies:
- {type: home, end: 1000, location: unknown}
for a date after 1000 with a born before 1000 will return:
output origin
output home

because unknown != null


[11/26/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but I don't think you want:


[11/26/2023 7:23 PM] .deciusmus
why?


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
there is no valid home so it is null; origin is unknown


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
if the only line is type: home, end: 1000, location: Unknown that is both the home and the origin


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, after 1000


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
if the current date is after 1000 you will get

Origin: unknown
Home: unknown


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[11/26/2023 7:25 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure that is wrong though


[11/26/2023 7:25 PM] rsulfuratus
this is why i was asking about how to process unknown locations


[11/26/2023 7:25 PM] .deciusmus
Like, why did you write the words:

"location: unknown"

instead of the shorter

"location:"


[11/26/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
that one might not be wrong, but:
- {type: home, end: 1000}

should definitely just return:
Origin: unknown

and 
- {type: home, end: 1000, location: ""}
should probably also return 
Origin: unknown


[11/26/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but null != ""


[11/26/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
and I think null != undefined but I'm not sure because java is weird


[11/26/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so you need to convert to null explicity, I think


[11/26/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
I think you are getting bogged down in the implementation


[11/26/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
What are you trying to express with

* type: home, end: 1000


[11/26/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
It seems like, in general, an odd line to ever write on its own


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
moved from somewhere to somewhere but I'm not sure where


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
grash for exampl


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] .deciusmus
It seems arbitrary to me that you prefer to see

Origin: unknown
vs
Home: unknown


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I just don't want to see both


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] .deciusmus
but you wont


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] .deciusmus
assuming "==" is defined in a rational way


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] rsulfuratus
if one is "" and the other is null you will


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I think


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but I don't really understand java falsey-ness very well


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] .deciusmus
but again, you are getting caught up in (a) trying to make "hard" cases and (b) implementation details


[11/26/2023 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
well I am trying to change my code to match this spec


[11/26/2023 7:30 PM] .deciusmus
it is kinda reasonable to say a couple of different things

1) we already normalize whereabouts, so it is trivial to decide that "", " ", "     ", undefined, null all equal undefined in the normalization code
2) we are not writing this code for an arbitrary set of 1000s of users, I'm not convinced there is any reason why it would be difficult to just change the location tag to location:


[11/26/2023 7:31 PM] rsulfuratus
it is one line of code


[11/26/2023 7:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but I have to make a decision about whether falsely values are considered null or not


[11/26/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
Well, I would put it more simply, which is to say that any line that contains only whitespace is considered equal to any line that is contains only whitespace


[11/26/2023 7:33 PM] .deciusmus
if I didn't trust javascript I'd write it as something like

if (location == undefined ||  location == null  || location.length == 0 || location.isWhitespace()) normalizedLoc = undefined


[11/26/2023 7:34 PM] .deciusmus
but I think it is a relatively unimportant bit of logic


[11/26/2023 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
I think this is actually the right logic:

```if (whereabout.origin.location != whereabout.home.location) {
        // display origin if it is not the same as home //
        displayString += originString + "\n"    
    } 
    
    // always display home
    displayString += homeString + "\n"

    // we want to display the current location only if
    //  (a) it is different from home
    //  (b) or we don't have a home

    if (!home.location || whereabout.home.location != whereabout.current.location) {        
        displayString += currentString + "\n"
    }

    // we display the last known location only if
    //  (a) it is different from current
    //  (b) it is different from home
    //  (c) it is set (i.e. not unknown)
    if (whereabout.lastKnown.location != whereabout.current.location && 
        whereabout.lastKnown.location != whereabout.home.location &&
        whereabout.lastKnown.location) {
        displayString += knownString + "\n"
    }
```


[11/26/2023 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
The idea is that we 
(a) always show home
(b) show origin if it is not home
(c) show current if it is different from home or we don't have a home
(d) show last known if it is different from something we have already shown


[11/26/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think you can simplify (d) - I think you only ever show lastknown if current is unknown


[11/26/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
so change (a) to current is unkown


[11/26/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
(and lastknown is not unknown)


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
do you want to show it if home is known?


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. a last known @ home? I guess


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, if current is unknown


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
or I guess maybe not


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think only if home is also unknown


[11/26/2023 8:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right, if home is known it implies last known = home


[11/26/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if you have

home: X, end: 1100

in 1101

I think you have

home: unknown
current: unknown
last known: X


[11/26/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
but I think that is fine


[11/26/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think you show last known only if both home & current are unknown and it is known


[11/26/2023 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I think by default the whereaboutsHomeUnknown = ""


[11/26/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
Oh, I didn't bother with any of that


[11/26/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't think we needed it?


[11/26/2023 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
the use case that occurs to me is when you have an item where you want to display " Current owner: unknown"


[11/26/2023 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
isn't that going to work with current location: unknown though


[11/26/2023 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think the whereaboutsHomeUnkown, etc strings are not that useful


[11/26/2023 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think the problem is that for items, you have to treat home as special, and away as always an actual location


[11/26/2023 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., if you want an item to be "Make in: <location>", Owner: <person>", how do you do that?


[11/26/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
Do you want to distinguish between the "owner" and the "location"?


[11/26/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
the only reason I can think of to use "type: away" for items is if you want to say: this item is not with its owner


[11/26/2023 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/26/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe I'm overcomplicated it


[11/26/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it is, in general, fine to show:

Origin: unknown
Home: unknown
Current Location: unknown

It is rare that anyone bother's to setup whereabouts that would generate that


[11/26/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
So why not show it if you do?


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
(and actually, with the rules above, you'd never get that


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
it would just be

Origin: somewhere
home: unknown
current location: unknown


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
well, won't:
- {type: home, end: 1700, location: place}
generate that for anything after 1700?


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
your second thing


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
that is actually quite common in my experience


[11/26/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
really? what's the in-world example? someone you know left home but you haven't decided where they went?


[11/26/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for an item with a known maker and an unknown owner


[11/26/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
which is a decent number of items that are worth having whereabouts for


[11/26/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
that are not possessed by a member of the party


[11/26/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
it is also common for people who were born somewhere, and are now wandering


[11/26/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
which is a decent number of NPCs


[11/26/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
they would usually have subsequent away lines


[11/26/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
I am not convinced - for npcs at least - that it isn't better to just add something like

type: home, location: on the road, start: 1701


[11/26/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
then you get:

origin: somewhere
home: on the road
current location location: unknown
last known location: (somewhere or an away line)


[11/26/2023 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but the whole point is they don't have a home


[11/26/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
If I wanted across an NPC of yours, I would strongly prefer to know if you intended them to be wandering or hadn't made up a home


[11/26/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
*wandered across


[11/26/2023 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
imagine you have an NPC in Tollen you create, and what you know about them is:

* they were born in Embry
* they settled in tollen in the 1730s


[11/26/2023 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
I want the whereabouts structure to be able to express the difference between that and

* they were born in Embry
* they wandered, unsettled, without a fixed home, until the 1730s when they settled in tollen


[11/26/2023 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
The first NPC is fair game to be running an inn in Telham. The second one, probably not


[11/26/2023 8:35 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, it's all a bit edge-case


[11/26/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess in that case though I would just think you could trust the implicit unknown location


[11/26/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Eg if embry has an end date, fair game


[11/26/2023 8:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Rather of embry has an end date, then everything until the next start date is ‚Äútruly unknown could be anywhere‚Äù


[11/26/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
If embry doesn‚Äôt have an end date, best to assume they moved straight from embry to Tollen


[11/26/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I am just not sure why I‚Äôd want to always have to type an extra line instead of just setting an end date


[11/26/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
The way whereabouts works makes it implicit that dates on home locations have meaning


[11/26/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
The exception being people like grash or Apollyon who might have secret locations


[11/26/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
But that is a different challenge


[11/26/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not saying you should type an extra line


[11/26/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm saying you shouldn't UNLESS you want the home to be known definitely as "they didn't have a home"


[11/26/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
I'm arguing there is a difference between:

NPC X has an unknown home and
NPC X has no home


[11/26/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I think if you want to communicate a person was in a fixed location but you don‚Äôt know where, you use type = home location = unknown


[11/26/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I can‚Äôt think of anyone I‚Äôve made up for whom that is true


[11/26/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
Sorry, I am not sure I am being clear


[11/26/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
Going back to your Tollen/embry example, the difference for me is whether the origin line has an end


[11/26/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
I don't mean "fixed location, don't know where". I mean a difference between

* I don't know what this person was doing between 1721 and 1742. They could have been having a family, they could have been adventuring, they could have been doing anything

VS

* This person left home in 1721, and wandered about for a while, mostly in greater Sembara, and they ended in 1742 in Tollen


[11/26/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
in both cases you have an end date on home 1 (Embry) of 1721 and a start date on home 2 (Tollen) of 1742


[11/26/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
The real question is, in that period, how do you show the "home" line. The options are:

Origin: Embry
Home: Unknown
Current Location: Unknown
Last Known Location (1721): Embry

VS

Origin: Embry
Current Location: Unknown
Last Known Location (1721): Embry

--

Basically, the question is, is there meaning in showing an unknown home


[11/26/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
Previously, we had declared that we don't show unknown anything except current location


[11/26/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
But now we are moving towards showing unknown origins, which is fine, but I am not sure what the argument is for unknown origins but not unknown hoes


[11/26/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
*homes


[11/26/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Ah okay, yes, in the case where I know someone left embry in 1721 and wandered with no home for a while until they settled in Tollen in 1742, I would probably explicitly set home to ‚Äúunknown‚Äù or ‚Äúwandering‚Äù


[11/26/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
But that is very rare edge case





[12/8/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that is kind of my suggestion above


[12/8/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
political spheres of influence and geographic regions don't line up


[12/8/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
I am just not totally sold on that from a "making things up" standpoint


[12/8/2023 10:36 AM] .deciusmus
Where do I put a page on the Aurbez Plateau? It is entirely within the refounded alliance...


[12/8/2023 10:36 AM] .deciusmus
but it is a geographic feature


[12/8/2023 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/8/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
so browsing some of the imo better D&D sourcebooks, it seems the usual solution is to just have super unrealistic maps with like 5% of the river systems the world would actually have


[12/8/2023 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think Taelgar doesn't have enough rivers! üôÇ


[12/8/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah it has way too few. i have a bunch of new dunmari rivers


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
although it has a decent number of trunks/main lines


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
Sembara feels good to me, ignoring the little brooks and streams


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
everything just needs about 20 more tributaries


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
actually the mapped areas are pretty good


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
I have a ton more rivers in the north coast too


[12/8/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
you'll see when you finally bother to go to Tollen and the kenku scout describes the area to wellby to map ;-0


[12/8/2023 10:39 AM] .deciusmus
heh üôÇ


[12/8/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess rivers are actually the major challenge in some sense


[12/8/2023 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think the right answer lies a bit in "why are you writing a page"


[12/8/2023 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I think there is fun/value in having well developed climate/geographic overview/river system pages


[12/8/2023 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
but I think those are kinda orthogonal to the "political units, small forests, little brooks, bridges, towns, ruined forts" type pages that give color to an are


[12/8/2023 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
sure but something like 90% of river pages are just stubs anyway to track a name


[12/8/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe it makes sense to just pull rivers (and maybe roads? less certain there) out of the region organization


[12/8/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
or at least, pull major watersheds that span political regions


[12/8/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
this would basically be the chasa watershed and the hara/mahar/istaros watershed


[12/8/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
Right I think what I am suggesting is that I think having something ike:


Gazetteer
- Western Green Sea Region
--- Volta Watershed
--- Semb Watershed
--- Mostreve Hills
- Central Lowlands Region
--- Istaros Watershed
--- Dunmari Basin
- Green Sea Realms
--- Tollen
--- Sembara
- Dunmar
- Dwarven Realms
---- Nardith
- Chardonian Empire
---
- North Coast Realms
--- Mawar


[12/8/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
could work


[12/8/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe that's too many folders though


[12/8/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I can't decide if depth is better or worse than long lists though


[12/8/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess I would say that the top level folders should aim to be a large grouping of subfolders that make sense to access together


[12/8/2023 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
Probably a strict organization is too hard


[12/8/2023 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
E.g., I want Dunmar in the Central Lowlands region because there is a lot of adjacent wilderness that is adventuring territory


[12/8/2023 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
or, you want those in the same folder


[12/8/2023 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
i prefer to keep the top level contents of any one folder to around 10 max


[12/8/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Note that we don't attempt to do that for people at all


[12/8/2023 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah for people it seems less important because at least from a browsing perspective you are usually going to be going from a link


[12/8/2023 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
we also don't have folder pages for people for imo the same reason, you don't really click on "halflings" and then browse


[12/8/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
originally we organized by species/ancestry for automation purposes, not sure that is still useful but nice to break things up somehow


[12/8/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
Not sure I want to think about people, but honestly its an area where a pretty flat list would probably be fine. What I actually want is to be able to see all the people in Cleenseau, but tagging+dataview works a lot better for that than folders


[12/8/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
right, not interested in reorging people now


[12/8/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
Back to places...


[12/8/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
one challenge is that things get made up at weird levels of detail


[12/8/2023 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
I think to simplify the current issue before I get back to working on work: all I'd really like to decide right now is how to handle river systems that span regions, from three options:
1) pull large watersheds (for some definition of large) out of region folders entirely and organize watershed-related geographic features (primarily rivers) independently
2) move some river pages to be in the region hierarchy that is where the bulk of the river system is, even if that means there is a bit of annoying jumping back and forth for a handful of regions where the river system and the political sphere of influence don't line up (e.g., Elderwood rivers on the west coast and the Aurbez-area tributaries of the Istaros)
3) Just rely on linking with ![[]]. Have a master page for each river in the region where it is most contained and then for e.g. the Istaros just link the Mahar (doesn't work as well for tributaries)


[12/8/2023 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
4) something else


[12/8/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
I like #1


[12/8/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
okay, yeah that is what I am leaning towards as well.


[12/8/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
I am going to pull istaros-mahar out into its own group and we can see how that works

{Reactions}
üëç

[12/8/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
easy to move pages back if needed


[12/8/2023 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not convinced that for climate description purposes it doesn't make more sense to tie the region to the watershed, but that is not a critical decision for right now


[12/8/2023 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
it does make more sense for sure


[12/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
probably the best organization is actually to have large scale geography (climate, mountains, rivers, large scale geographic features) organized separately from "regions"


[12/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
where "region" is more like "sphere of influence"


[12/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
basically have a top-down structure and a bottom up structure


[12/8/2023 11:07 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, that is kinda what I was trying to describe above, but I don't think I quite hit it


[12/8/2023 11:07 AM] .deciusmus
but what you are saying makes a lot of sense


[12/8/2023 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
right, yeah


[12/8/2023 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
something like my page on Aurbez and the Ardonne probably belongs in the Istaros-Mahar watershed


[12/8/2023 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
I should have probably done this on a branch but too late now


[12/8/2023 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
whereas the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez belongs "near" Maseau and Sembara


[12/8/2023 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
eh, that's fine


[12/8/2023 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not in the middle of anything


[12/8/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
just push at some point even if in progress because I have a 2 hr planning meeting this afternoon that I will probably ignore parts of and work on something or other


[12/8/2023 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
okay


[12/8/2023 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
what do you think of this?

Chasa-Nahadi Watershed
- the Chasa and Nahadi river systems (including lake valandros)
- all the forested slopes of the western sentinels
- deno'qai villages excluding northern deno'qai from delwath solo

Isataros-Mahar Watershed
- plaguelands
- xurkhaz
- all the rivers that feed into this large river system, excluding the hara
- the aurbez geographic region pages
- orenlas

West Coast
- Chardonian Empire
- Mawar
- rivers entirely contained within this region, including the Yeraad
- nevos sea
- geographic features w/i or near these areas and not already in the Chasa-Nahadi watershed

Dunmar Region
- all of Dunmar
- Hara river system
- Nashtkar
- Garamjala
- various geographic features contained entirely within this area
- Yuvanti and Nardith

Western Green Sea
(this is large, could be split, probably by moving skaerhem and vostok out and merging with ursk into a north green sea coast)
- all of "greater semabara"
- cymea
- vostok
- tollen
- skaerhem
- geographic features contained within these regions

Eastern Green Sea
- ursk
- irrla
- eastern islands
- medju

Far North
(stub)

South
(stub, just Kenzo solo)


[12/8/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
where are the sentinals?


[12/8/2023 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah just realized


[12/8/2023 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
they'd be a top-level directory


[12/8/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
I'd make them a top level folder


[12/8/2023 11:32 AM] .deciusmus
but looks good


[12/8/2023 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus
I have to get back to work by noon so I'm going to do a reorg then push

üëç

[12/8/2023 11:35 AM] .deciusmus
I'd actually be tempted to split Greater Sembara out into its own top level, with Cymea/Skaerhem/Vostok/Tollen as the "Western Green Sea"


[12/8/2023 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
you wouldn't put Tollen in Greater Sembara? seems like there are a lot of links there


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, probably


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
actually


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus
although also a lot of links between Tollen and Cymea


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus
but that is actually probably fine to span regions


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, I was originally thinking it has a lot more ties to the broader Green Sea than Sembara does


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
hence "western green sea"


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
but it is really a melting pot, which is always going to be wrong no matter who you group it with


[12/8/2023 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
conceptually though from a features point of view the north coast (skaerhem/vostok/ursk) is distinct from "greater sembara" (sembara/tyrwingha/highland/marches) and "western green sea" (tollen/cymea)


[12/8/2023 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
I think actually I'd prefer too many top level categories for now and we can collapse later so I might just to that


[12/8/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
then irrla/eastern islands/medju is eastern green sea


[12/8/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
Vostok doesn't feel north coast to me, the forests in central vostok stretch directly to the sembaran highlands


[12/8/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
guess that's true


[12/8/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
but parts of the coast is very skaer-influenced


[12/8/2023 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe it should just be one big thing


[12/8/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, it is a another melting pot


[12/8/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
To me, making Greater Sembara top level is useful just to have less depth for my cleenseau pages


[12/8/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
i think right now I'm doing greater sembara just as highland kingdoms marches tyrwingha sembara


[12/8/2023 11:43 AM] .deciusmus
yeah that works


[12/8/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
the tollen/cymea/skaerhem/vostok as western green sea


[12/8/2023 11:43 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/8/2023 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed


[12/8/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
keeps rivers together for the most part, main consequence is separating politics from geography for aurbez area and for chasa river valley. but i think that is fine


[12/8/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
(didn't move little brooks or anything, fat brook in tollen is still in tollen even though volta is in Greater Sembara)


[12/8/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
also makes the whole desolation of cha'mutte thing cleaner, since this is all in mahar-istaros watershed now

{Reactions}
üëç

[12/8/2023 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
might still shift a few things around (garamjala probably should move to mahar watershed from Greater Dunmar; might split the eastern and western halves of the far north so forest of nightmares and ursk aren't lumped together)


[12/8/2023 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but busy rest of day so won't mess around further until tonight or tomorrow, if then (need to do session notes and session prep for my low level minigame which wraps up sunday)

[12/8/2023 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[12/8/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
and potentially rewrite the "Geography of Taelgar" page to better characterize the places


[12/8/2023 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
what is your feeling on ~xxx~ places? In Worldbuilding\Unnamed or "where they belong"?


[12/8/2023 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
where they belong

If I am listenting to a planning meeting I only 40% care about its perfect type of background task


[12/8/2023 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
Taelgar needs a couple of endorheic (not draining to ocean) drainage basisns


[12/8/2023 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
It's probably too big a change, but you could imagine that the upheaveal of the Yuvanti mountains /plaguelands disrupted the Istaros watershed and that actually the northern and southern halves are not connected


[12/8/2023 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
So the Andonne drains into the plaguelands but the Drogar and Kulthul rivers actually originate in the plaguelands or even the southern borders, ratehr than the Istaros actually flowing through


[12/8/2023 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
this isn't the right place for it. the dunmari basin, however, potentially is, if the hara is disconnected


[12/8/2023 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
which it might be. haven't decided yet


[12/8/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
would potentially create an interesting seasonal wetlands east of the yuvanti when the monsoon rains cause the hara to flood


[12/8/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
similar to some areas in southern sahara or the kalahari


[12/8/2023 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
actually that's very similar to the Otavangi (sp) delta in Namibia/Botswana


[12/8/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/8/2023 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
did you push anything btw? I have like 10 minutes until my next meeting


[12/8/2023 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
no, I got distracted 
(a) thinking about rewriting Geo of taelgar
(b) fixing unit tests for work


[12/8/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i


[12/8/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I've been thinking about endorheic basins a lot. a little less than 20% of earths surface is endorheic, and they tend to require desert-like conditions to persist


[12/8/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
because otherwise the water just cuts through the barrier eventually


[12/8/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so e.g. the mahar is probably not a great place, there is too much water flowing through it


[12/8/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
but there is also likely a large endorheic basin in the great desert area


[12/8/2023 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
should have figured you would have read the wikipedia page already given your previously stated river basin obesssion


[12/8/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
equivalent to chad basin in north africa


[12/8/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
the thing taelgar really lacks is something like the giant himalayas / caspian sea basin


[12/8/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
yeah. the sentinals are fascinating because they have no large plateau around them. I don't think there is a good analoge on earth except maybe parts of the andes


[12/8/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
but they really just kinda push up from nowhere. clear evidence of no plate tectonics


[12/8/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
üôÇ


[12/8/2023 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
they are kind of rockies-inspired imo


[12/8/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
yeah but the rockies have 1000 miles of high plateau behind them


[12/8/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
maybe not quite 1000, but a lot


[12/8/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
I tend to think of the Sembaran rivers as somewhat analogous to the India/Ganges river valley


[12/8/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
you have this wall-like set of mountains that arises out of almost flat land


[12/8/2023 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
really? then why are they called the highland kingdoms?


[12/8/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
they are like "lowland" nepal or bhutan or the highland indian provinces


[12/8/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
but they are pretty small


[12/8/2023 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
maybe that's wrong, I haven't thought about it super-carefully


[12/8/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
To me the Sembara river systems imply a pretty rugged hilly uplands


[12/8/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
you need spines of high terrain separting the river valleys


[12/8/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
otherwise you'd end up with Dunmar with just the Hara in the middle


[12/8/2023 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
doesn't have to be mountains but Sembara does not seem like a flat plain to me


[12/8/2023 3:22 PM] .deciusmus
what keeps the seine/loire/rhein/elbe as separate rivers?


[12/8/2023 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
hah that is just the map I was looking at


[12/8/2023 3:25 PM] rsulfuratus

[12/8/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure what you have planned in the north, but it probably makes more sense to split the "Northern Green Sea" from the "Far North"


[12/8/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
Boundary would be a bit fuzzy but it would distinguish the stuff north west of Vostok and especially on the western side of the Sentinels from Ursk and the mountains north of Urks


[12/8/2023 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that makes sense


[12/8/2023 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Far North might not quite be the right title but the north coast of the green sea (extending from "Kenku Homeland" east to "Far North Peninsula") is definitely distinct from Pandar/Forest of Nightmares area

Realistically, there are probably 3 regions up there, the "northern green sea", the "far north" (which is basically polar/artcic regions), and the "north coast" or "north west" which includes forest of nightmares/pandar and the farther north coast

[12/8/2023 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
a few things are misclassified but I basically like it. I was about to do something similar. my one major modification would be to keep things that are unmapped* in tentative


[12/8/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
by unmapped I mean things like "far north peninsula" or "north bay"


[12/8/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
features that exist basically as coastline


[12/8/2023 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
i would also keep the southern continent and related in either brainstorming or tentative


[12/8/2023 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the only unmapped feature I'd include in the main gazetteer is the ~great desert~

[12/8/2023 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus

I am generally aiming to set river whereabouts to the watershed they are part of (although technically "partOf" is probably better here, but since that is all up the air not switching over yet). the aim being to make it easy to query a set of connected rivers. not sure how far I'll get tonight

Zimka is intended to be evolved from Semb


[12/8/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
very explicitly same root as Vostok could be 
Pemvos (the people of the Semb) Pemvora
also could use Kemvos Semvos Kambvos


[12/8/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
(Kem is already a river in Vostok so probably not that)


[12/9/2023 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
Vostok is supposed to be "homeland of the Vos", so people = Vos, land = tok. that gives you the ~English/Tollender translation Vosland and the variants Voslaag and Vosklad for "lowlanders" and "highlanders" which is then used synonymously with the name of the region (e.g. like Gauls/Gaul)

List of country-name etymologies
This list covers English-language country names with their etymologies. Some of these include notes on indigenous names and their etymologies. Countries in italics are endonyms or no longer exist as sovereign political entities.


[12/9/2023 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
main reason to care is if you want to have an "indigenous" name and a "foreign" name, e.g. Skaergenland / Skaer Islands vs Skaerhem; Vosland vs Vostok


[12/9/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
E.g. Zimland as the name used by Sembarans, Zimtovia or Zimkovia as the indigenous name


[12/9/2023 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus
my general take is that is most interesting from a game/worldbuilding perspective when you have distinct cultures close together that might clash. So no one would call Dunmar Dunland or whatever so we don't care about etymology, but some future adventure might for sure be interested in the political/cultural dimensions "Sembaran" vs "East-Northerner"


[12/9/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I was thinking Semvos would be "the people of the Sem"


[12/9/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
Or whatever alternate, i.e. Pemvos Kambvos


[12/9/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
so the "highlanders" would call themselves "Semvos" and the place Semkovia or whatever


[12/9/2023 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Ah right. Yes



[12/26/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
on a totally separate topic, I'm thinking of putting the neo-easterner religion in Usk / northern Green Sea


[12/26/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
possibly Irrla as well, tbd


[12/26/2023 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
Is Ursk the right place for an interesting religion on top of all the mage stuff?


[12/26/2023 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I guess we explicitly left out religion when doing the Artem backstory to make it easy to add in later whatever seemed right


[12/26/2023 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
And its a good place to introduce it in game.


[12/26/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so things will be more complicated than I'm letting on


[12/26/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but the basic idea is that it would be useful for the people of the northern Green Sea coast - east of Skaerhem all the way to the Eastern Isles - to be culturally distinct from western/southern green sea


[12/26/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
basically trying to figure out the cultural strands of the green sea


[12/26/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
you have:
- "east northerners" that become the highland cultures of Sembara and Vostok


[12/26/2023 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
- "ancient mariners" that are Skaer


[12/26/2023 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
- "east southerners" that become Medju / mariner trade pensisula with undetermined religion but which has some cultural connections to each other and are outward-looking / trade oriented


[12/26/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
that leaves basically only Irrla and the north coast


[12/26/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
(this is excluding drankorian-influenced areas in Cymea / South Cymea / Western Gulf; and Dunmari-influenced areas in South Cymea)


[12/26/2023 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
both irrla and north coast are relatively not seafaring


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
so probably should have a fairly significant cultural break with the Hkaran mariner culture


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
Did you look throughthe old emails from last summer about mariner trade peninsula?


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
I thought there was some good stuff there, and I think we were leaning towards the "divine spark" religion as north coast/Irrla


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/26/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the ^^ is basically a summary of those discussions


[12/26/2023 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right.


[12/26/2023 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
I'd add that the above shouldn't imply that the eastern isles themselves (which are quite large) are not another cultural strain TBD


[12/26/2023 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right, eastern isles themselves are strange and unique and potentially dominated by non-humans anyway


[12/26/2023 3:51 PM] .deciusmus
I liked this idea for the MTP itself:
The overriding attitude of MTP religion though is one that says: love your gods for if you do, they will watch over you. And there is also a strong sense of: the more love you give, the more love you have to give. This very strongly encourages adopting lots of additional gods. I am imaging the most religious folks having rosary bead style chains of symbols of many different gods and ships decorated with totems to many different gods, the more the better.


[12/26/2023 3:52 PM] .deciusmus
which doesn't really impact putting divine spark up in Ursk/Irrla


[12/26/2023 3:52 PM] .deciusmus
(plus this
The divine spark religion doesn‚Äôt actually contribute gods to this mix, but it does contribute a meditative tradition that the MTP people see as a way to get closer to the gods, and so there is a unusual semi-Buddhist style self-awareness / meditation philosophy that floats around. This leads to some folks say chanting a sutra to twelve different gods to strengthen their connection to them.)


[12/26/2023 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, there is a lot of good stuff about MTP there but not my current focus, at least not until you do the cursed demon waters sidequest


[12/26/2023 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
the things that are currently not clear in my mind are:
- is Irrla culturally related to Ursk/north coast or is it a distinct thing? 
- how big of a cultural break is the Skaer / Vostok Mountains?
- how long has Ursk been settled? Is the isolation a relatively new thing or does this go back 1000 years?


[12/26/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, yes, I think that all makes sense especially the "northern" route - basically a big split between the Vos (east northerns), Skaer (ancient mariner), and Ursk/Irrla/NorthCoast, which themselves are quite distinct from the "east southerns" who end up being the basis of MTP/Medju


[12/26/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
My instinct is that irrla is distinct


[12/26/2023 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is my instinct too


[12/26/2023 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
although that could theoretically still leave the possibility of Irrla as a part of the divine spark culture if there was an early split between Ursk/north coast and Irrla w/i the divine spark tradition. e.g. could have a indian/japanese buddhist kind of thing


[12/26/2023 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[12/26/2023 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
As far as Ursk, the old Artem backstory thread had a lot of good ideas


[12/26/2023 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it was pretty marginal land until the various Urskian magical rituals were developed


[12/26/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Also the Artem backstory had the novja which we had theorized were a different cultural strain


[12/26/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
oh yes, that is going to come back


[12/26/2023 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it works best if Ursk has grown a lot in the last 300-500 years, since the various magical rituals were established, but that without those rituals it is a pretty marginal land and never had large population


[12/26/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps there are two strains of divine spark people on Irrla and scattered along the northern green sea coast, and for whatever reason the north green sea coast folk turn away from large-scale seafaring


[12/26/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
and, if not exactly isolationist, have low population densities, no big cities, and weird dangerous crap like vampires and dragons to deal with, so they develop a low-key culture based around low population denisties


[12/26/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
depending on your plans, this culture could become the novja, or the novja could be a more Vostok/northern group heading east


[12/26/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
But I think Skaer is a big cultural break. I think the Ursk culture is not particularly similar to Skaer/Vostok at all


[12/26/2023 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, okay. still a few moving pieces I'm trying to decide what the most fun would be


[12/26/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, the novja could be culturally related to Skaer


[12/26/2023 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
if the novja are a vostok / northern group, that potentially sets up a religious conflict with kestavo vs divine spark


[12/26/2023 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
or, you have a divine spark vs magocracy


[12/26/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
conceptually I kind of feel like either could work but from pure worldbuilding logic it is probably more likely to have north coast settlers as divine spark and then magocracy grow out of that, rather than the novja be vos-related


[12/26/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
kestavo vs divine spark seems like it would be an odd set to be in conflict


[12/26/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess you could have these sense that the divine spark tradition is *usurping* the kestavo


[12/26/2023 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think it is more:
the Vostok mountains are a serious barrier to travel, so you have basically wilds on the other side, and you get the divine spark religion out of which a magocracy grows, setting up a cultural conflict between the "old magocracy" and the novja

vs

the various highlander cultures spread across the entire interior Taiga, and blend in various ways, producing the Sembaran highlands, the Vos, and the ancestors of the novja with some degree of cultural continunity; then, as the magocracy develops on the coast they conquer the inland


[12/26/2023 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
in the current day the vostok mountains and the interior (even the coast) east of Skaerhem is very inhospitable but that could be relatively recent


[12/26/2023 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
the Artem backstory kind of implied #2 but with the origin of the novja undetermined, that doesn't mean the implication has to be true


[12/26/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it could swing either way, it just depends:
is the magocracy conquering a very distinct culture (vos/highlander) or a relatively related culture (novja/divine spark who lived inland instead of on the coast)


[12/26/2023 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
I like the novja being distinct, personally.


[12/26/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don't have strong feelings


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
And small differences can loom large, ultimately, so the "you are half foreign" vibe of the novja could happen even if the cultural difference isn't huge to being with


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think the novja should feel different now


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
no matter what


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
question is just 500 years ago, how different were they?


[12/26/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I kinda of  like the idea of this band of northern-small-gods people spreading almost from coast to coast across the taiga and northern forests of Taelgar


[12/26/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
And then the mariners come into the picture but on the north coast, really hug the coast, with these small scattered coastal villages. For a thousand years they might not even know that there were people way to the north, especially if the rivers are cold, frozen some of the time, and hard to navigate


[12/26/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
So you end up with two low population density groups, a divine spark group who left the mariner traditions behind and live in small groups along the coast, and a (probably semi-nomadic) vos/kestavo/northern culture farther north in the forests


[12/26/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps there is a more urbanized divine spark group on Irrla, who develop in their own unique way


[12/26/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
but that can be undetermined


[12/26/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
Then, the magocracy arises, say 500 years ago, and urbanizes and the population grows (a lot) amongst (some section?) of the divine spark people


[12/26/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
and then post-Great War they conquer the northern people


[12/26/2023 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm. yeah, this could work. will ponder a bit


[12/26/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
But honestly, a single divine spark culture could work as well. Why does one group go north though?


[12/26/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
The land seems marginal-ish and it isn't clear why you wouldn't end up with dense(r) coastal settlement


[12/26/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in that case, the idea would be that you have relatively uniform low-density settlement at first. development of rituals allows bigger cities to be protected, and you get something like an 'urban / rural' split


[12/26/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
for a while these cultures just develop in peace separate from each other


[12/26/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
then something changes after the great war, prompting urban culture to expand


[12/26/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
this could be whatever drives expansion in the northerner scenario as well


[12/26/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I can see how that work would, but I kinda like the small-gods-northern-band as a unifying factor across taelgar

Sunset Gate: a line stretching from somewhere in Amberglow to somewhere in northern Sembara. It‚Äôs a line of materialized color - yellows and reds and oranges painted in the sky, but as these physical barriers - like paint brush strokes just sitting in the air, almost. The colors are physical and passing through them is impossible, by they are riddled with cracks and openings. In some places, these cracks are sharp and dangerous, and passing through has weird time effects - sometimes it takes a day or a year to walk through a crack. In other places, especially near Twilight‚Äôs Grace, there are elaborate structures


[12/28/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
Since Amberglow fell it‚Äôs been even odder and weirder and the time effects worse and less predictable. And sometimes dark clouds race along the colors, blotting them out and bringing especial danger as it‚Äôs hard to even tell where the edges are


[12/28/2023 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
Where it passes through Duskmire, near the Darkwood, Umbraeth has chiseled and chipped tried to tear it down, but it has grown back as a tangled maze of angry reds and oranges, like sharp glass. It‚Äôs especially difficult to pass and this has lead to the Darkwood, despite being the original heart of Umbraeths domain, now somewhat different

I‚Äôm moving on from feywild to the sembaran impacts of the ‚Äúundead plague‚Äù that‚Äôs happening right now in 1720. I might tweak some borders and sizes of baronies, I assume you aren‚Äôt committed to anything specific here

Sharpshire is good for the ruined fey kingdom


[12/29/2023 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
Not really hugely a fan of any of the beast names. Also, what were the imagined borders of this place? This is overlapping the bulk of Sembara?


[12/29/2023 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
I didn‚Äôt love those names either. As far as the place I imagine it more overlapping with highland kingdoms and eastern sembara. Western sembara is probably allies of Ethlenn or something


[12/29/2023 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
Oops, reverse that. Western sembara


[12/29/2023 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
So from west to east the fey realms in sembara are:
Far west - remains of Sharpspire north of that animal-place
Then Duskmire, again with the animalplace north of it.


[12/29/2023 2:51 PM] .deciusmus

But at a high level I‚Äôm envisioning a animal fey kingdom over the highlands, bordering Duskmire to the north, and something else over Embry / heartlands, north of sunset gate and the various ‚Äúnon-realm‚Äù ethlenn allies


[12/29/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
is the animal place relevant to duskmire? or just an idea for something that could be north of duskmire and would prevent duskmire from expanding?


[12/29/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
Just an idea

[12/31/2023 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
not hard. coastlines are a bit of a pain but adding rivers and forests is easy


[12/31/2023 2:16 PM] .deciusmus
If you get a chance, adding Cleenseau Wood, which basically streches from immediately north of cleenseau to ~30 miles south of Ainwick, and then a couple small hills just east of the wood in the northern part of the Barony of Aveil would be great

I assume you haven't gotten to this; I have a few more tweaks to Sembara


[1/2/2024 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Correct


[1/2/2024 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Might do it tonight so send whatever other tweaks you have

[1/2/2024 1:09 PM] .deciusmus
the 3 added grey boxes are new hills : extensions of Braebine and Aine Hills, plus the new Aveil Ridge


[1/2/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
The arrows show the direction the lines of hills run; Braebine and Aine are basically where the land starts to rise towards the highlands


[1/2/2024 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
The green areas are new forests, one just north of Cleenseau the other extending along the entire highand side of the Aine Hills


[1/2/2024 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
There are several new rivers in blue; the ones in Arnsbury and Tyrwingha are a bit arbitrary and could be whatever feels right on the map; the forked river in Aveil I've made up stuff for


[1/2/2024 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
The new river in "WM4" is to establish a bit of a border


[1/2/2024 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
Then, if you want to tweak the political units layer:

The section labeled #1 around Dunore is the new Barony of Usbourg
The section labeled #2 around Ainwick is the (now much smaller) Barony of Ainwick
The "highlands" region of Sembara proper grows to include everything north of Chemin/Ainwick/Usbourg (labeled 4, but hard to see)
The "WM4" (Marches of Bronva) is everything west of the new river in WM


[1/2/2024 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
Also TM1/TM2 are gone and just "Tyrwingha" and I'd be inclined to make Adderfell a bit smaller


[1/2/2024 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed new version of world map


[1/2/2024 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
generally for precise detail I'd suggest making a separate hexmap since it is difficult to represent things that are <30 miles or so on the world map


[1/2/2024 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense


[1/2/2024 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I've used these

[1/2/2024 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure that Amberglow would ever have extended as far north as Cleenseau


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
feywild geography is not a perfect match for material plane geography - but even so that would make amberglow very big


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't mean to imply it did


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] .deciusmus
where did you get that from?


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] .deciusmus
Vahavia's report?


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/2/2024 10:37 PM] .deciusmus
They would not have thought that this was Amberglow, just contrasting it to a more pleasant fey place


[1/2/2024 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
ah - in that case I would think he'd refer to Dreamhaven


[1/2/2024 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean it is kind of a meaningless detail


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but of course pre Great War the elves of Ainuymara would have relatively close contact with Dreamhaven


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I was thinking the elves of Rostare might have had a connect to Amberglow. Might just drop it though, my players have no idea what any of these realms mean


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
wait, I also confused myself


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
Vahaiya is not from Rostare - that was gone long before they were born


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
Ignore Rostare above, that not from the Vahaiya letter, it was in the drankor stuff


[1/2/2024 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus
you also have Marcel de Valarin dying in 1658, which is before the Vahaiya letter


[1/2/2024 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
oops


[1/2/2024 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
I should fix his death date


[1/2/2024 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
it isn't canonical, just tossed in


[1/2/2024 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus
in 'An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realms' I would change Rostare to Orenlas


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Rostare is really far away - like 2000 miles from Tyrwingha


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
whereas Orenlas is immediately next door and would be concerned with the fey in their neighborhood


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, for some reason I thought it was close to Drankor


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
but yeah, makes sense


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
it is close to drankor. drankor is 2000 miles from Tyrwingha


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
I guess Drankor is really far away


[1/2/2024 10:45 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I think what ultimately caused the rift between Ethlenn and Umbraeth was his tendency to trick humans into the Feywild either to be his servants, or even to be ensorcelled by other fey outside of Twiligt's Grace, or just for giggles to be left somewhere dangerous to die


[1/2/2024 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i like that


[1/2/2024 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
She probably tolerates some amount of fey-being-fey around humans, but violating the refuge she extended to Tyrwinghans to come to the Feywild is unforgiveable


[1/2/2024 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
other than those comments I think the letters and books are fine. i removed the status/tim and pushed but didn't make other changes so assume you'll make small edits as discussed / clean up


[1/2/2024 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
yup


[1/2/2024 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
I rewrote the Amberglow line to just talk about stories of "realms"


[1/2/2024 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
unnamed


[1/2/2024 10:48 PM] rsulfuratus
oh, one other thing - I'm not actually sure how closely related demi-planes and fey / shadowfell domains are. i might remove the mention of demiplanes from the drankor book since it seems unnecessary game-wise to link them


[1/2/2024 10:50 PM] .deciusmus
In another my game topic, the lich's plan to destroy Sembara is coming into view.... 

Step 1: Cast a really powerful and hard to cast spell (took a year or two of prep) that caused a decent percent (1%?) of the dead in southern Sembara to rise up as zombies/skeletons/etc
Step 2: Absolutely and completely mismanage the response...


[1/2/2024 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
really minor point


[1/2/2024 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
The mismanagement involves things like imposing a wealth tax to raise an army, but doing so on halflings and lizardfolk as well as humans (which is not what sembaran law says)


[1/2/2024 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
Having some of his controlled barons (he only has a few) collect the tax twice


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
Mixing up the army and sending it various different places, so Fellburn stays under siege from a bunch of hobgoblin zombies through the winter,


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
Specifically trying to stir up the Duke of Wisford so he rebels


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
etc


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] .deciusmus
Whatever my PCs do, a group of adventures is going to kill the lich in 6 months (July 1720) and things will get fixed after that


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
why does the lich want to destroy Sembara again?


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
or does it not matter for the campaign?


[1/2/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
It matters a lot for the 2nd part of the campaign, but not entirely sorted out. The short version is that he was a wizard with a desire for life extension, doing dubious research, the House of Sewick specifically destroyed his research/tried him for illegal magic, he escaped, vowed revenge on the House of Sewick


[1/2/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
So actually it is less about destroying Sembara than the House of Sewick specifically. Probably he is hoping one of the northern dukes will eventually organize a coup of some kind


[1/2/2024 10:56 PM] .deciusmus
I have a vague backstory but I need to work it out a little bit more, at the moment it is still a bit unclear, other than a personal vendetta against the House of Sewick for what he sees as ruining his life


[1/2/2024 11:01 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed one more book - contains a bunch of stories about fey - less impact on other parts of the world or things you made up, but I did leave it status/tim


[1/2/2024 11:01 PM] .deciusmus
going to bed now


[1/3/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
writing notes on Delwath's dream conversation with Sura. what are you specifically trying to learn here? Sura is mostly going to want to talk about surviving the experience of losing a chunk of your life, having never expected to find someone else who survived a similar experience, but for someone with Delwath's persuasion and charisma it would presumably be pretty easy to steer the conversation to whatever you want to learn


[1/3/2024 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
Delwath would be happy to be a dream therapist for Sura (or more accurately, to start a part-of-your-life-disappeared support group via Dream), and would honestly probably get sucked into that kind of conversation pretty easily


[1/3/2024 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
For "stuff to learn" mostly just "how is the negotiations of Karnas going" / "what's the state of the conflict"


[1/3/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
FYI I think Delwath will keep up the dream-based lost-time-survivors-support-group over our downtime. Not every night but once a week or once every 10 days or so,  influenced by Sura's interest as well obviously


[1/3/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
I'll ask the gods at some point if they know of anyone nearby who has lost time in extra-dimensional spaces other than the Feywild (hint hint for the Deno'qai who would be in the same boat, right?)


[1/3/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, the tanshi say, there is some relatively close in the same boat


[1/3/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have an "official" layer for Sembaran borders? Is there any reason for me to not just draw stuff myself for now?


[1/3/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't have an up-to-date borders layer in the official map, no


[1/3/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
no reason not to draw it yourself. it is tough to label lots of things in the big map otherwise everything is just covered in text


[1/3/2024 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
what font did you use for your labels

I've been mucking about with Sembara in more detail, as I try to work out the impacts of this mass of undead. Not really changing much from the big Sembara document, but a few things I wanted to at least vaguely run by you...

The basic idea of the new map is that 
(a) there is a core unit of the six ancient duchies and a few border baronies (Aveil + Ainwick) which is the historic ancient Sembara
(b) this is all the lowlands ... as the land rises north and west of several different lines of hills, you get into a loosely defined border with the highland kingdoms. There are lots (at least a dozen, perhaps two dozen) baronies here, and there is no "formal border" but really a loose line of loyalties. This "highland Sembara" stretches all the way from the Volta to the Wistel..
(c) Then there are the southern borderlands (south of the Enst) and the western borderlands (west of Ainwick/Cleenseau). These are all lands that have had significant post-Great War distruption. The western borderlands were largely depopulated in the aftermath of the Great War, as the destruction of Urlich Pass changed the entire economic rationale, and refugees fled west. A small number of military towns (i.e. Dunmore from the original one-shot) remained, but the land would have been really sparsely populated in the 1580s.
The lands south of the Enst were ruled by hogoblins for 50 years in the early 1600s


[1/4/2024 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
So basically, all of the infrastructure west of Aveil/Ainwick and south of the Enst was rebuilt/reestablished during the long peaceful reign of Cece I, which I imagine was also a baby boom time. Settlers were flowing west and south to populate these new lands, etc


[1/4/2024 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
The far western baronies (Dunfry/Usbourg/Enford/Bronva) were explicitly establised by Cece as military districts, although by 1748 the direct military relationship has probably faded, especially in Dunfry and Usbourg


[1/4/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
The southern baronies (I have 5 but might expand to 6 or 7) were all new grants, also by Cece, largely to loyalists from the wars. That section (between the Enst and Adderfell) is probably decent farmland, it was just ravaged by hobgoblins and war. So it is probably somewhat booming these days, lots of growth


[1/4/2024 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
historically, Maseau and Adderfell were never part of "historic" Sembara. Maseau was established by Derik I after his defeat of Atavas, as basically new land,


[1/4/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
Adderfell I think has always had close ties with Tyrwingha, and is probably only not part of Tyrwingha because the Tyrwinghan borders are set by Ethlenn for mysterious reasons and she doesn't want it -- although it is likely somewhat congruent with her kingdom.


[1/4/2024 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
For a long time the earls of Adderfell probably looked to Tyrwingha for direction, and they only gradually came into the Sembaran orbit after Derik became king of Tyrwingha. But probably in some formal sense, it has never been "ruled" by Sembara in the sense that its always been an allied state, not a specific and direct place ruled by the monarch, so to speak


[1/4/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this all basically works. one thing to think about is who exactly are the people living in these places? I've been reading the Great Sea again (the Mediterranean book I started in Nantucket, but I got bored after the fall of Rome and put it aside for a while until recently), and one thing that is really clear from this, which is probably obvious but perhaps isn't incorporated enough into Taelgar worldbuilding, is that you have these big empires that expand and contract across the Mediterranean over 600 years, but for the most part, the people don't move around (with some exceptions like medieval spain and some trade colonies)


[1/4/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
so I guess I would think a bit about what the cultures are here


[1/4/2024 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
Well, that's part of why I want the Great War to have been so depopulating


[1/4/2024 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, you have refugee movements and resettlement too


[1/4/2024 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
I think basically there are two ancient cultures here -- the highland culture and the lowland culture, which spread up the river valleys


[1/4/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
Within the lowland culture (which is the core of Sembara today) you have a Tyrwinghan variant, which isn't hugely different, but has some unique strains via the fey connection


[1/4/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
Maseau is always been a bit of a marginal borderland.


[1/4/2024 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I would think Maseau would have been fairly rich Drankorian province, if only by nearby association with Isingue


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm, maybe


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but probably no need to go back that far, really


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like the land is less fertile.


[1/4/2024 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
The southern part of Maseau, probably. The northern section south of the Enst is kinda marginal farmland, compared to more eastern Sembara


[1/4/2024 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
But also, ignoring that far back


[1/4/2024 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
Start with Atavas, say


[1/4/2024 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
The whole area between Insingue and Sembara is under hobgoblin rule for some time. They probably don't kill everyone, but you would imagine that as being pretty disruptive


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, and at that point for a while it probably feels like Sembara is pretty cut off


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
insignue is still connected to Dunmar-Chardon trade routes and the Green Sea via Orenlas / Cymea / "South Cymea"


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[1/4/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
And I suspect a lot of refugee flows *south* during the Atavas wars


[1/4/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that would make sense - this is also the height of Dunmar's military power


[1/4/2024 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right, so that seems like a safer bet. But Derik is the one who actually defeats Atavas, and has an upper hand at reestablishing the human kingdoms in the region


[1/4/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Isingue is closer to Kharsan than Tokra to Kharsan, for example


[1/4/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
So he finds someone suitable, makes them a Duke and gets them to pledge feudal loyalty to him, and so a somewhat depopulated Maseau - which its own more Insinguen culture somewhat distinct from Sembara gets incorporated into the kingdom


[1/4/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
So at the eve of the Great War you have basically 5 cultures in Sembara:

* The highland culture
* The lowland culture, which spreads all the way to the mountains along the Enst
* The Tyringhan vairnt of the lowland culture, also in Adderfell
* The Maseau culture, kinda weakened/depopulated
* The northern/Tollen-influenced culture which is another variant of Sembaran, but basically not too different, along the Volta


[1/4/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right I was just typing exactly same thing but slower


[1/4/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
politically, the lowland culture is very dominant at this point, as well


[1/4/2024 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of fell like Tyrwingha is a bit more diverged than this makes it seem, though. by the time of the Great War, the Tyrwinghans have been living under the protection of the fey for ~1000 years


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i would think that would not be a minor influence


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but part of Drankor


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
But yeah, actually, I have been playing in my game Tyrwingha has more different than "a variant"


[1/4/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
My player with a Tyrinwghan PC has a tendency to play her character as "somewhat foreign, why do these Sembarans do things weird" which I have not discourged


[1/4/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
but I think it works with the above, i.e. Tyrwingha probably feels pretty different. The unification of the two realms has always been a personal union of crowns, not some kind of real "single country"


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so then you have Great War, west is upended, plaguelands, all that


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right. And then in the early 1600s everything south of the Enst is ruled by hobgoblins for 50 years


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
almost


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
40-something


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
at this point everyone who survives is basically just pledging themselves to Derik III in desperation


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
Right, although Sembara also is abandoning people left and right


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
after Derik III dies though


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/4/2024 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so at that point I think there is room for a bit more complex set of loyalities and obligations that doesn't result in Sembara just being one big country in a modern sense


[1/4/2024 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
you already have personal union of crowns that joins Sembara and Tyrwingha


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but for example adderfell can have relatively shifting loyalities


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah - although I think Adderfell has been more of a Tyrwinghan than Sembaran allied state


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
historically


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
then of course this motivates Cece I to install loyalists in the newly created duchies / marches


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think a lot of places perhaps have more of a feel of "the Barony of Aveil" than "Sembara", wouldn't they?


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
Well, I think that changed during Cece's reign


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
it was 60-ish years of peace and prosperity


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
everyone loved her


[1/4/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
Well, let me think it through


[1/4/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean my sense historically is that it often was not very important to the people of random place X whether their lord owed alliegance to the king of france or the king of england, except insomuch as it meant they might be killed fighting in a war


[1/4/2024 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
It seems like at the beginning of Cece's reign, you have:

* Maseau, which has been separated from Sembara by a hobgoblin kingdom for 50 years and also has had its own influx of refugees and challenges on its southern border
* Adderfell, which is also separated from Sembara by hobgoblins, and probably heavily dependent on the Tyrwinghan knights for aid which stuff gets bad
* Tyrwingha, which has only been recently rejoined with the Sembaran crown and which has a pretty distinct culture at this point


[1/4/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
* The highlands, which really are a place of shifting loyalties, where the "border" is kinda meaningless, and some local lord might be loyal to the monarch of Ardlas rather than Sembara, and which might feel very much like the "barony of whatever" rather than sembara or ardlas specifically


[1/4/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
* The core ancient duchies, which I think includes Aveil and Ainwick (although they were historically the border baronies and loyal to the Duke of Wisford)


[1/4/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
* The western military baronies, still very much army camps and frontier, not so many people


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the bigger worldbuilding question is: given all the danger out there, and magic, and the gods, do humans actually regularly fight wars of conquest?


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
No, I think probably not


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think I agree


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, sometimes things happen - i.e. Chardon + Dunmar. But you don't have stuff like the Norman Conquest of England that often


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm thinking about the approximately 1000 wars fought over siciliy, for example


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
you could imagine a scenario where northern cymea is constantly changing hands to control the straights


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
or the long term war between the english and french kings over france


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the question then is, the absence of wars of conquest, what changes alliegance? i think generally there would be a very strong incentive to be allied with someone bigger


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is a feeling of safety


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example most of the Drankorian conquest of Sembara isn't really a war. it is "we have a huge army and a million wizards" and the sembarans going "awesome come stay"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Sure


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Although there are exceptions, i.e. the highlanders


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right, obviously


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it *all* has to be "no war conquest"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
no, of course not, but a lot less than in the real world


[1/4/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, agreed


[1/4/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but I actually think that means you tend to have a bit more local identity, e.g. Barony of Aveil is not not-Sembaran, exactly - the people who live there are largely Sembaran in culture


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
and while through long ties of alliance and culture, Aveil is always looking to Sembara first, Sembara probably wouldn't march knights on them if the next Baron refused to swear alliegance to the king


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
they might, of course


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but it would be far from a guarantee


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think that is true


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, if an upstart knight in Cleenseau declares himself king of the river lands, the Baron of Aveil almost certainly is marching knights against him, I would think


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
Although I think its a bit more complicated than that


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the " long ties of alliance and culture" elides a lot, yes


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but, it would be a reason why the lich would imagine this plan could work


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think the Baron of Aveil is a bad example only because I have in my mind that it has ancient ties to the Duchy of Wisford


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
The big duchies are a better example


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
But yes, I agree


[1/4/2024 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
I think at some level, the lich is trying to get the six duchies to each one declare indepedence from Sembara and destroy the sembaran crown that way


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
The first step is to get Wisford, which I think is one of the most powerful duchies, to suceed


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
I think an interesting historical model is actually in a way the early modern Spanish crown


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right with land and stuff all over the place?


[1/4/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
no I was thinking you have castile, aragon, etc


[1/4/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
they are unified and all owe allegiance to the same king but also you have powerful local power bases


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
right before the hapsburgs


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
like 1500s

Composite monarchy
A composite monarchy (or composite state) is a historical category, introduced by H. G. Koenigsberger in 1975 and popularised by Sir John H. Elliott, that describes early modern states consisting of several countries under one ruler, sometimes designated as a personal union, who governs his territories as if they were separate kingdoms, in accor...


[1/4/2024 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right although I dont actually want to make up 6 different sets of taxes and laws and such üôÇ


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right I wouldn't go to that extreme


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
you just need vibes


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
basically the point is the Duke of Wisford is an important person with independent power


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
And in fact, in a weird position right now, because their historic influence over the southern Enst border has waned significantly


[1/4/2024 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
Because after Wisford bore the brunt of the Shattered Ice Clan attacks, and then Cece's resettlement was focused on crown loyalists


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
And actually I have it in my plan that the baron of Aveil is actually working for the lich or controlled by the lich or something


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
Which works really well to isolate Wisford


[1/4/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
And then, on top of that:
* Wisford has close ties to the lizardfolk of Ozabal Swamp
* Fellburn was a center of a lot of battles, so there are a lot of dead. It is going to suffer a lot more form the raise 0.5% of dead than many places


[1/4/2024 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, I agree with all of that


[1/4/2024 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
The other point I was going for in my thinking above is that the southern and western baronies are basically "new" from Cece's reign


[1/4/2024 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
And the southern borderlands in particular have grown a lot - good farmland then, and a sense of economic possibilities..


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think those baronies would have largely (entirely?) been personal possessions of the crown


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
whether that is still true in 1750 can be an open question


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, after reconquest, for sure


[1/4/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
But I think Cece gifted a lot of of them out


[1/4/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
And probably in the chaos after the lich dies Wisford gets back some level of control


[1/4/2024 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
especially because the next queen is Elaine II who is strongly Tyrwinghan


[1/4/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
and so I think in 1750, its more balanced -- the crown has more wealth and resources partly from an expanded royal demense in the south, but also at least some of the barons are currently back in the Wisford orbit


[1/4/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure it matters much, its all a peaceful land these days. The action is in Adderfell / March of Andonne / Aurbez


[1/4/2024 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I was thinking Maseau might have gained at the expense of Wisford


[1/4/2024 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that is possible as well


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway doesn't really matter for now


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
Oh, one last thought -- I'm trying to figure out when the western wall was built


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking maybe recently -- during Cece's reign, by dwarves, with some magical assistance from Tollen


[1/4/2024 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that works. I am pretty sure I explicitly imagined the wall was *not* there for the stone titan one shot


[1/4/2024 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and then it wouldn't have really made sense as a place to build a wall during the hobgoblin occupation


[1/4/2024 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so I would probably put it ~1660-1670


[1/4/2024 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also make it more magical


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
it is not just with the help of dwarves, it is with the help of stone giants


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
or something like that


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
or earth elementals


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
right, I like elementals more than stone giants. But yeah, good point


[1/4/2024 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
it might not really matter exactly. maybe there are lots of rumors


[1/4/2024 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe cece found a ring of three wishes and wished for a wall


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
ooh, I like that


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
maybe Cece stole a ring of three wishs from the lich


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
before he was a lich


[1/4/2024 10:18 PM] rsulfuratus
only potential flavor issue there is a ring of three wishes is about as arcane magic as arcane magic gets


[1/4/2024 10:18 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, true


[1/4/2024 10:19 PM] .deciusmus
although maybe it was Cece's secret


[1/5/2024 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a image that I might use as a emblem for Avatus:

assets/avatus-symbol-sketch.png


[1/5/2024 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
Any concerns? This is coming up in my game via some undead warriors ressurected from battlefields of the Atavus wars


[1/5/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
looks fine to me


[1/5/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Working more on my Dunmar page. Trying to model a bit on Wikipedia with say a short section on ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù and then a link to a longer page as needed as I feel like it is kind of a lot to have 1000 words on Dunmari politics if you just want a quick overview


[1/5/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
‚ÄúExpanded‚Äù notes for geography, religion, and history have obvious homes


[1/5/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
But eg politics, culture, economy and trade, justice/law don‚Äôt right now


[1/5/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking about the same issues for Sembara, i.e. tax law is going to be relevant in the session after next, I was going to try to pull togeher some notes but was't sure where to put it


[1/5/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
For now I‚Äôm thinking about just leaving in gazetteer


[1/5/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to suggest the same


[1/5/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, going back to the Highland Kingdoms name, I was going to make a obsidian change for a new tenative name...

Do you prefer 

Zimka (people)/Zimkovia (place) 
Pemvos (people)/Pemvora (place)


[1/5/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
Not necessarily final, but I want to start using something oher than highlands in other stuff about sembara region


[1/5/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
Although I like Zimka / Zimkovia (or Zimkova), Zovcka is probably too similar, so would probably need to change


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, Zovcka is the place that sees itself as "the true home" of the Zimka people


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
hence the similarity of name


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, maybe a little too confusing in actual game but I think it works from a worldbuilding perspective


[1/5/2024 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
eh I'm not really sold, I think the names are kind of in an uncanny valley where they are close enough that you confuse them but not so close as to be obviously from the same root


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure why you couldn't just change the name of Zovcka, as far as I know it has never come up in any game


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
yeah you might be right


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, changing Zovcka is no problem


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
The term "highlander" has come up a few times in my game but I don't have any issue just changing it, it is just background color. And none of the kingdom names matter


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
honestly I'm not even sure Zovcka is a kingdom


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
highlander is just what the sembarans call the Zimka


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
But it came up because one of the players speaks Zimka, but again, no issue just telling him I renamed the languag


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly I might just erase Zovcka for now


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
why does there have to be a specific name for the Zimka people north of Breva that were never controlled by Sembara?


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
(rhetorical question)


[1/5/2024 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
Actually the more I think about that I like it because naming it as a "kingdom" kinda guides the mind in a certain direction, and I'm not sure the Zimka really have the same concept of kingship as the sembaras


[1/5/2024 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm working a bit on land tenure in Sembara, and based on our previous conversation, rethinking a bit about how it grew outside the original six duchies.


[1/5/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
The original timeline I wrote imagined a series of conquests but that doesn‚Äôt really feel right


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
Who was living in these places after the fall of Drankor? I‚Äôm not really sure.


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
That said the Great War depopulated a lot of it so maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think I'd bother to write much of that old history


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that was the conclusion I was coming to


[1/5/2024 1:35 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing that is obvious after revisiting my old dunmar notes is that while I had some good bones of things, there is a lot in the old google docs that turned out to be wrong after playing a game in dunmar for 3 years, and it is a lot easier now to write up a good dunmar page. 

so I'm kind of inclined to be a little careful over-inventing stuff - or at least committing to stuff as canon - too early


[1/5/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a complete draft of my rewritten Dunmar note, curious if you have any feedback, especially on organization


[1/5/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
subnotes are not generally done, or are just notes


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I'm looking at dunmar


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a note on land holding in sembara that I'd appreciate thoughts on


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
largely based on medieval england and the complexity of French/Normal law vs Anglo-Saxon law


[1/5/2024 3:27 PM] .deciusmus
I like the organization a lot


[1/5/2024 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
on sembaran land ownership - I think the vibe feels right in general. specific comments mostly on non-humans


[1/5/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
One comment on Dunmar, btw: what are the borders, exactly? Is there some set of land that is considered "dunmar" by the gods?


[1/5/2024 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
my feeling is probably not


[1/5/2024 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
the "the gods own the land" is more of a cultural/religious aspect of dunmari culture than the gods actually owning the land


[1/5/2024 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
although i do have a bunch of old, dubiously canonical notes about the gods specifically bringing the dunmari to this place for a particular purpose


[1/5/2024 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
or perhaps it goes the other way, the longer the dunmari occupy a place, the more the gods grow to inhabit it


[1/5/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
I like the vibe of the dunmari being more a people than a place, per se.


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
That is, Dunmar doesn't really have formal borders or political organization, it is the membership in a temple and the relationship of the temple to the Samraat that matters, not where you live


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that is definitely true


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
So I think the political organization in the note could clarify that a bit more


[1/5/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I also kind of like the idea that the reason it is Shakun - after all, a rather minor diety - is responsible for the defense of the eastern border from all kinds of bad things is specifically because unlike the five siblings, she was born to a Dunmari and had a physical connection to the land


[1/5/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway on land holdings:


[1/5/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
1. dwarves I think would certainly own land, but probably never not outright (and even taxes might be complicated). dwarves would very likely outlive the lord of the manor, and there could theoretically be dwarven communities that have passed down land for longer than Sembara has existed


[1/5/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure exactly how this would play out and it probably isn't formalized in the way that relationships with lizardfolk and halflings are


[1/5/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but it doesn't seem very dwarvish for a dwarf to consider themselves a "peasant"


[1/5/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think maybe that's just a poor choice of words in my doc


[1/5/2024 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think freehold land is particularly "subserviant"


[1/5/2024 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
well yes, even putting aside the subserviant aspect


[1/5/2024 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno, if the dwarf buys Sembaran land, why would they be against paying taxes onit?


[1/5/2024 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
Or why wouldn't a dwarven smith by willing to lease some land from a lord, or whoever, because they didn't intended to stay for more than 30-50 years, so a 50 year lease seemed better than outright buying the land?


[1/5/2024 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think they would be against paying taxes on it - or even, necessarily, leasing it. i'm thinking about the opposite arrangement though, where the dwarves are already there and perhaps have been there for a while, and the land is now claimed as crownland or whatever


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
RIght, in those cases I just think the land would have never been claimed as crownland


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
Its folkland


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, sure, okay, that makes sense


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
I actually envision the legal arrangements in some places as being quite complex


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so you might have little bits of folkland on a manorial estate that was in some dwarven family since before barony of X even exists


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, exactly


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Now, the dwarves might sell it, in which case it becomes crownland


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
You can't really sell folkland outside of your "folk"


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
so in this case, to non-dwarves


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
By the dwarves could sublease it, or whatever


[1/5/2024 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, I think that works. dwarves are basically fine with debts and obligations and would generalyl fit in the system, although I think could be a lot of odd quirks (e.g. a dwarf might offer a very large sum instead of annual taxes in order to turn a piece of crownland back into folkland, for some  reason)


[1/5/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, that's basically the same idea as the lizardfolk. You are negoiating with the duke or king or queen


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the only think I would change about lizardfolk is that there is probably room for a range of attitudes here


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
all lizardfolk consider their land folkland


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but some lizardfolk might consider much of lowland sembara as "lizardfolk land"


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
since historically (long ago) it was


[1/5/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
so there may be times when lizardfolk just settle without asking for permission and dare the local lord to do something about it


[1/5/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
this doesn't have to be common but I don't think relationships between sembarans and lizardfolk need to be 100% peaceful all the time


[1/5/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
true. I'm just not sure I want to set up Sembara in the role of colonizer taking the indigenous land


[1/5/2024 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
fair, although it is pretty different since the humans were there long ago too, and the lizardfolk weren't driven out by the humans


[1/5/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Right, just if it comes up in an actual game I'd want it to be more differentiated and less coded as "hey this was our land, we are taking it back"


[1/5/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I wouldn't play it as that. I don't think the lizardfolk would view sembaran settlements as occupying stolen land - it is more a question of rents on profits


[1/5/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
and whether it is formally sensible to lay claim to unsettled, unimproved land


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps (some) lizardfolk understand unimproved, unsettled land as simply empty and free to be claimed by anyone willing to work it


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
the sembarans who settled and built cities are doing exactly what they should - settle and grow and the land is yours


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
it is only the idea of a lord saying "this land is mine by right of whatever" *without* settling it or working it


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
Right, in fact, the ancient idea of folkland matches that exactly and could even have come (at least in part) from the lizardfolk


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
of course going back to earlier conversations about lizardfolk they might have very different ideas of what improving land means


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think the vibe is still right regardless of details - the basic idea is the land supports you and you support it, and that is what gives you property rights


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
not the fact that you marched an army through two years ago


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
(Some) lizardfolk then just reject all the "overlord/sovereign" stuff


[1/5/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps other lizardfolk see the building walls and maintaining borders as "improving" the land in a way that gives the crown control


[1/5/2024 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
It could just play almost as a disagreement about scope. Is maintaining a road through a wilderness an improvement to all of that empty land?


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
and I think it is more interesting if there are a range of opinions and disagreements among the lizardfolk

{Reactions}
üëç

[1/5/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
now, halflings are more complicated


[1/5/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
Ultimately almost all of the "new" crownland outside of the ancient duchies either came about via 
* a slow process of accretion as (human) families died out, or sold land, and various tracts and bits and pieces came under the control of the crown
* major depopulation events were reversed by armies, and the crown claimed all the land they freed from the hobgoblins/whatever


[1/5/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I really don't think halflings would give a hoot about some human lord. if a halfling family wants to settle down and run an inn on the road between fellburn and rinburg, they aren't going to negotiate with some lord


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
they are going to build an inn, and run it. or negotiate with someone who owns an inn, and take it over


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
the whole concept that someone can "own" land feels very un-halfling


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that said, they probably feel fine about paying taxes


[1/5/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
but also probably have their own opinions about what taxes are fair


[1/5/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Do you envision halflings as just kinda like ignoring local law?


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, almost completely


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Presumably they aren't going to just decide this piece of farmland looks nice so I'm just going to take it over


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
It seems hard to be a member of society in a fixed location and ignore the laws


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
well, they have their own laws


[1/5/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example you can't just take stuff would be enforced at the halfling end of things not the human end of things, so to speak


[1/5/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Why would humans put up with that though?


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
I guess if it works and doesn't really cause problems


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
well usually halflings are pretty well behaved, and they are quick to punish their own troublemakers


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
But why would the human lords of the land tolerate a halfling effectively just stealing their land?


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I don't really imagine halflings wanted to build a home in the middle of nowhere


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
people tolerate it because it doesn't always end up as "stealing"


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
If you are building an inn just outside the walls of Rinburg, what, they just do it even though someone owns that land?


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that is the "you can't just take land"


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I'd imagine it like this. say a halfling family wants to start an inn outside Rinburg


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a nice orchard near the river, just along the road, that seems perfect.


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
the set up camp in the orchard, and let it be known that they want to stay


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
and then they wait


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
probably they don't build anything for a year, but they have a little market


[1/5/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
presumably at some point -- relatively soon, unless it is owned by an absentee landlord or something -- whoever owns the orchard (if they aren't the person working it every day) shows up


[1/5/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the halflings ask if they can build an inn, and what the person wants


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
if they can't come to an agreement, they move on. maybe they come back in a generation and see if the new owners are more amenable


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but most people agree pretty quickly, because the halflings remember strange things. you don't want your kids cursing you out for refusing a good offer


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
and sometimes what the halflings offer is way more than what the land is worth


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but isn't that in fact "negoitating with some lord"?


[1/5/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess I was more thinking about chains of obligations


[1/5/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
But land really doesn't have a chain of obligations


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
well, you owe tax to someone


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, but most taxes are only on argicultural produce


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
An inn doesn't owe property tax


[1/5/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
and halflings, for example, might not always agree on who owns land. if you are a peasant who has a 50 year lease, the halfings might decide you own the land, not the lord


[1/5/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but it gets dicey for the person with the 50 year lease


[1/5/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
sure. although there are probably plenty of stories (true or false) of halflings who gave some peasant a comparatively huge some of money for land they didn't technically own, and then the peasant just skipped town


[1/5/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and left the halflings to deal with the lord


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right, and the retribution would fall on the peasant not the haflings ,ultimately, because the lord doesn't want to piss off the halflings


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
that is why they skip town


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
But sometimes they are caught anyway


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
of course. basically the idea is the haflings don't really interact with the formal system of land registeries and deeds


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
And othertimes the halflings are forced to leave, although that probably doesn't end well for the lord


[1/5/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don't have a good sense of halflings view of collective punishment


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point schwartz and discussed this and were leaning towards the idea that halflings have a very strong sense of familial justice - so if your great great grandparent cheated their great great grandparent you are in trouble


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
Right I more meant if a lord pushes the halflings out, do they punish everyone who lives in the manor?


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
Or just the lords family


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
no, just the lords family


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
But they might not always have a good mechanism to do that


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
right, which is why sometimes the halflings get pushed out


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
Also, it doesn't strike me as obvious that the halfling would decide that the yearly lease-fee is meaningless, i.e. would they actually want to ruin some small scale landholder?


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
I guess maybe sometimes they do


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
and other times they don't


[1/5/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
halflings are supposed to feel kind of chaotic


[1/5/2024 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
sometimes they. might double the yearly lease fee the previous owner was paying for no clear reason apparent to the landholder


[1/5/2024 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
What is a halfling view on contracts?


[1/5/2024 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I think their view is roughly something like my present self cannot compel an obligation from my future self to your future self\


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
of course this can't be taken to the extreme or you couldn't even buy something from them


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think generally most people would be wary of long term contracts with halflings


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. you'd never make a 50 year lease with a halfling imagining it would be kept


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
you'd make a series of 1 year leases


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
But I think from the perspective of Sembaran land holding, it boils down to 
(a) a halfling would consider the land theirs as long as they had purchased it fairly and they were still using it
(b) halflings don't always agree with the Sembaran legal system as to who the owner is or what theterms of purchase "should be"


[1/5/2024 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
right, and if they acquire a freehold, and would normally owe a manorial tax, they might also not agree with the lord on what the manorial tax should be - they would view this as a negotiation where the amount owed might include 0, instead of something the lord gets to decide


[1/5/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
Well...


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't refactored the taxes part, but I think for the most part the manorial taxes are a percetage of the harvest


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
If you build an inn, nothing is due


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but then doesn't the growth of a city just cost money? unless the lord is getting it back in other taxes


[1/5/2024 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
I have a separate taxes document that basically has 3 main taxes:

the deca and nonem, which are 1/10 and 1/9 of the harvest (so collectively, 19% of the harvest), due on argicultural produce
the hearth tax, due from every building with a hearth


[1/5/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, sure, then halflings might pay the hearth tax but consider it a negiotiation to set a fair rate


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Then, additionally, there is a baronial tax, owed by the baron to the crown or duke, for which the baron has to collect money


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Often via market taxes, taxes on inns, poll taxes (i.e. tax per person), bridge/road taxes, etc


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
But I kinda assume halflings would generally pay these, if they saw them as fair taxes for the stuff they are gettig (.e. use of a road)


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so this is a bit separate from landowning per se but the general view of halflings would not be "we don't pay those taxes" it would be "we offer you what is fair and negotiate"


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
And it probably comes out in the wash, i.e. the one time the baron gets stiffed, but some other time a halfling caravan pays 10x as much


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
So mostly who is going to complain


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that people should see halflings a bit like a lottery ticket but with fair odds


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
and then human pyschology takes over and the stories of winning circulate in a way that the stories of losing don't


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
Right the other bit is mandatory gifts, i.e. the lord of manor might expect gifts from everyone on the birth of the heir


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
but of course, this would also apply might more gently to halflings


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea of a mandatory gift would probably be seen as quite offensive by halflings


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
No one "demands" the halflings pay the gift, the lord lets it be known this has happened, and hopes for the best


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
Right but the idea of giving the lord a present on the birth of the heir, if the lord has been a huge boon to the local halfling community would not be weird at all


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
And might also be quite substantial


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
no, of course not, it could be vastly more than what you would expect


[1/5/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
this all plays into the lottery idea. if you keep the hallings that pass through your land happy and safe, then when your heir is born maybe you'll get something truly huge


[1/5/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
The only other source of money I have that would be very offensive to halflings is the idea of local monopolies


[1/5/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
and the story about how the lord of such-place's son got a dozen horses for a wedding gift from some halflings he'd never even met before travels far and wide (probably in part helped by halflings themselves)

{Reactions}
üëç

[1/5/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah halflings would just basically ignore those


[1/5/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
Probably one of the few things that would cause true conflict; if some lord's main source of incoming is the local monopoly on brewing, and a hafling decides to open a brewery/inn in the same town, the lord might not really have any good options


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but of course the halflings would know this, and although they should feel chaotic it isn't totally capricious


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
But I suspect that is quite rare, as these types of monopolies are usually on stuff like milling, brewing, bakehouses, etc not say "selling glassware"


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right. But that's how they punish the grandson of the lord who didn't let them build an inn without punishing the whole town


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
So to the poor grandson, maybe it really does seem capricious because he doesn't know that his grandfather refused a halfling deal


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
But that all works well, I think


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
it is caprcious to the humans but not the halflings


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
I think dwarves and local monopolies is more interesting; what I have in my notes is that the dwarves are given permission to ignore the local monopoly as long as they don't sell to humans. To me, that seems reasonable, but not sure your thoughts


[1/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i think dwarves are the most likely of any non-human race to have substantial "dwarven quarters" in human cities and towns


[1/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
so that does have a certain logic


[1/5/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i think depending on the size of the local dwarven community you'd have a variety of arrangements, but that feels like a plausible option


[1/5/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right. It isn't one size fits all on the Sembaran side either, a lot depends on the specific baron and duchy and lord


[1/5/2024 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i also think it is worth keeping in mind a little rare species like elves, centaurs, stoneborn, various fey, etc. they are rare enough that this is mostly going to be kind of one-off arrangements


[1/5/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
which would mostly exist outside of typical human rules and understanding


[1/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think there are no "general rules" outside of lizardfolk/halflings/dwarves.


[1/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
And even for halflings there are probably no laws, more folklore and word of mouth about how to best deal with them


[1/5/2024 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/7/2024 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a weird glitch with the website export where the callout boxes work when there is no pronunciation but don't work when there is a pronunciation. e.g. https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/Istaros%20Watershed/Orenlas/Erelion.html vs https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/Western%20Green%20Sea/Tollen/Tollen.html

haven't had a chance to read this stuff yet but did poke around a little bit about alternative website options, and wondering if you have opinions. 

Option 1: Quartz
https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/
JavaScript React-style static site generator
Pros: 
- understands Obsidian markdown natively so can go from processed vault -> html directly as a Github Action
- includes decent search, backlinks, popover previews, a number of other nice features
- heavily used in the Obsidian community if r/obsidianmd is accurate
Cons:
- written in TypeScript so fancy customization requires writing TypeScript (e.g., getting Leaflet to work or something)
- does not have nearly the ecosystem of themes and plugins that other static site generators have

Option 2: Material for mkdocs, Hugo, Jekyll or another "big" static site generator
https://github.com/collections/static-site-generators
Pros:
- usually have big communities, lots of themes/plugins, comprehensive documentation for setting up on Github Pages
- similar to the build process for my lab website so have some experience with this setup

Cons:
- would require some markdown cleanup to convert obsidian-flavored markdown to something else, including injection of backlinks and other 'obsidian-ish' content worth preserving
- requires some searching/optimizing to figure out the best option among a number of possibilities

Option 3: Obsidian

[1/9/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
oops


[1/9/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Option 3 coming


[1/9/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Option 3: Obsidian Digital Garden
something like https://dg-docs.ole.dev/
Pros:


[1/9/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Pros:
- build entirely as an obsidian plugin; potentially supports dataview and other complex things like that

Cons:
- build entirely as an obsidian plugin, so it can be kind of annoying to modify, extend, etc.


[1/9/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Another con:
- requires tagging notes to be published


[1/9/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
On a quick peak, Quartz seems promising


[1/9/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
I don't love a solution inside obsidian, as I suspect it is the hardest to make work, and is probably highly tied to the obsidian UI


[1/9/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
Typescript is just Javascript with some nice bits, so it is not a stretch from the existing script code-base


[1/9/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
Quartz also can use rehype/remark plugins although I don't know what that is


[1/9/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
It might be worth looking at how hard getting something like leaflet to work is


[1/9/2024 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
Lots of good lore drops there.


[1/9/2024 8:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I thought you'd appreciate that


[1/9/2024 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
Helpful to know the stuff I know out of game in game üòÄ



[1/28/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at various status/tim things. 

on Avatus: don't have strong feelings human vs hobgoblin; feel free to choose, or he could be something else entirely. 

I think the exact history of where this dominion came from can probably be left a bit unclear. 

I do think the vibe kind of suggests that in the aftermath of the fall of Drankor, Sembara is a bit of a backwater, initially. Especially once the Dunmari arrive in late 1100s and clear up the lingering curse, you have a pretty powerful set of realms from Cymea - Isingue - Dunmar - Chardon. 

The Skaer in a more raiding phase, and the Dominion of Avatus, really kind of hem in Sembara pre-Derik I.


[1/28/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
Yes; definitely think his dominion origination unclear for now; I do think the breakup of a fairly large autocracy is a good way to expand Sembara without "conqueoring" in the usual sense, so I like Avatus stretching basically from the mountains to Tyrwingha


[1/28/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
and Maseau/Addermarch/western Sembara comes from the collapse


[1/28/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so it does play a bit into the human/hobgoblin/other decision, to think a bit about whether the reconquest is liberating basically still intact populated areas that were ruled by Avatus, or resettling depopulated areas?


[1/28/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
of course viable to have either option for human or hobgoblin or something else


[1/28/2024 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i might actually be inclined to make Avatus a bit more unique/powerful in his own right than just human/hobgoblin, but without making him fantastic enough that it feels weird his unusual nature hasn't come up


[1/28/2024 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
I'm inclined to leave his exact nature somewhat undefined. He clearly has hobgoblins working for him, but I think he had motivations that were not exactly just pure destruction and murder


[1/28/2024 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that seems right


[1/28/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
At the same time, I think violence depopulates a place pretty rapidly.  So for practical purposes, I think a Maseau, for example, ends up being a "new" place after Avatus. If the deep history of Maseau ever matters, it probably isn't the case that there were literally no humans then when Avatus was defeated. But at the same time, the political structures were imposed by Derik I as part of the foundation of Sembara


[1/28/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
imposed is probably the wrong word - received gracefully. And then it became a land of a lot of new settlement


[1/28/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
So by the time of the Great War, Maseau and the other "new" duchies in Sembara are pretty Sembaran.


[1/28/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
But also, I guess, pretty Sembaran only in the sense of loyal to the House of Sewick


[1/28/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
so when things start to fall apart after the Great War, there is a distinct sense of place for Maseau


[1/28/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean it depends a bit on Avatus' motives. if he needs agricultural productivity, he is going to reign in his armies and make sure they don't massacre the peasants


[1/28/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, people will still flee


[1/28/2024 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, not sure it matters too much


[1/28/2024 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think what I'm actually trying to say is that whatever political entity did or did not exist pre-Avatus is functionally irrelevant post-Avatus. Maseau and other parts of western/borderland Sembara probably are generic "Sembaran/Drankorian" types, with fewer than usual Zimka/kestavo influences with a somewhat irrevelvant pre-Avatus history


[1/28/2024 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, agreed


[1/28/2024 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
I do think there is probably some sense of culture/people that is distinct from the heartland duchies


[1/28/2024 6:25 PM] .deciusmus
And so Derik I basically creates a new Duchy of Maseau where the duke is loyal to Sewick and declares a bunch of the land part of the royal demense and then leaves the Duke to run the place similar to how the dukes run the heartland duchies


[1/28/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the main semi-canon effects of Avatus are whatever you've introduced in your campaign, and the idea that the edge of the Sentinels west of Isingue remains something of a wildlands, a place where hobgoblins and other nasty things linger. you have e.g. Revaka three generations later, and then the various hobgoblin attacks / armies in the high school campaign


[1/28/2024 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so Avatus is kind of a useful placeholder there - defeated, but not every bit of his army wiped from the earth


[1/28/2024 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes I agree that the pre-Avatus political structures become irrelevant post-Avatus


[1/28/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
I imagine somewhat of a gradient, the upper Isatoros watershed is probably still pretty dangerous until post-Great War, when the shifting plaguelands prevent travel from going south via Isingue


[1/28/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. in 1500 you'd have a major trade route running via Urlich Pass and another running south from Cleenseau -> Maseau -> Isingue


[1/28/2024 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
but say, Raven's Hold is probably pretty marginal/doesn't exist/definitely isn't on a human trade road


[1/28/2024 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
Post Great War things shift as Urlich is destroyed (the impact of that I think was pretty brutal, it probably pretty much entirely depopulated the Duchy of Brovna, which I was envisioning as one of the richest duchies, sitting in Urlich / trade center  etc)


[1/28/2024 6:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Ravens Hold is originally constructed as part of a series of defenses in northern dunmar against hobgoblin activity pre-Great War


[1/28/2024 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
right, that fits the above perfectly


[1/28/2024 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
although I guess also with Ardith still intact the heart of the mountains were probably safer


[1/28/2024 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Below the mountains, yes. But I think the foothills were pretty dangerous


[1/28/2024 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
but the sweep of land where the Reofounded Alliance of Aurbez is now would have been pretty dangerous as well, I imagine


[1/28/2024 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes. Ardith would have been pretty fortified as well


[1/28/2024 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, in my "grand sweep of Sembaran history v2" I'm basically imagining, with the fall of Avatus, a series of powerful duchies established along the borders - Maseau and Brovna, in particular - which is a big expansion in the size of sembara and a big centralization of power as these duchies are much more under the control of the monarch than the traidtional duchies


[1/28/2024 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
added a few small notes to the human funerary traditions page, but generally would say it is good


[1/29/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
You have a misaligned SECRET tag in Drankoran Empire page


[1/30/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed the updated funeral stuff


[1/30/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
The tyrwingha page is still a bit vague but the rest I think is done


[1/31/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
I'm trying to clean up my Cleenseau NPCs because my players have started asking if random people they met 4 sessions ago are still around...

So I was trying to find all the people who are in Cleenseau, includingthe people I've created without whereabouts...

Do you have concerns if I set simple whereabouts on some people, i.e. 

Adam Gower = Tollen
Yelena = Ursk
etc?


[2/1/2024 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
nope that is fine


[2/1/2024 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
btw my next game is Sunday, was hoping to use the funeral stuff, if you get a chance to look would be great


[2/1/2024 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
also I just pushed a few comments on funerary traditions - nothing major basically look great to me

one note, the Drankor stuff I wrote for my own background but is not something I'm going to publish. I intended it to be "canonical inspiration for Sembara" but not necessarily a canonical representation of what Drankorians actually did

[2/1/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
I did one more pass through what I wrote, and updated the Tyrwingha page. Mostly reorganization, so there is a page in "Brainstorming" for ideas. I moved some of your notes into brainstorming or incorporated into the body of the text.

Will likely publish tomorrow after I do a little bit of NPC cleanup


[2/1/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
If you get a chance the main thing to look at would be Tyrwingha


[2/1/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it all looks good. i might at some point flesh out in a bit more detail some of the religious history, both the northern folk religions and the dunmari have a basic framework of "we need to help ensure the soul gets to the land of the dead but then the gods take over" vs mos numena "the gods will make sure the soul makes it to the land of the dead, but we need to help with the journey"


[2/1/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in terms of actual metaphysics both transitions are potentially fraught


[2/1/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is probably the case that the small gods of the northern folk religions (which also probably represent the original human religious tradition, more or less) actually do have more desire/capacity to shepherd souls, as they have always seemed more physically real than the more archetypal gods (mos numena, kaikkea)


[2/1/2024 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah. I assume that both transitions are technically fraught, but that the religious traditions developed in part because the gods actually do (mostly) do the things people think they do


[2/1/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
well there is probably something of a feedback loop as well


[2/1/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
It seems wrong to me that Drankor or Sembara would develop a totally false belief that the gods handle the sheparding of the soul into the land of the dead, if there wasn't some real truth to it.

I mean, presumably the reason all this stuff happens is because a group of humans with no death traditions at all, who just didn't bother, would in fact by plagued by ghosts and the like


[2/1/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[2/1/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that the basic idea is that the gods do the best they can but are fundamentally not omnipotent outside their own realms. 

death traditions are a way of amplifying the gods power and filling in gaps, in a sense.


[2/1/2024 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but also different gods have different strengths in some metaphysical sense. the small gods are, well, small, and so there is some sense that an individual god actually reaches into the land of the dead and follows/protects souls on the journey. but they don't have a lot of power on the material plane. 

mos numena has a lot of power so easier to protect the transition to the land of the dead, but then have a bit less influence, etc


[2/1/2024 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
none of this set in stone, just noodling a bit


[2/1/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I like the direction


[2/1/2024 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the general religious history idea is basically you start with small gods that are somewhat weak individually but which can intecede with arhat and malik on your behalf, but they are kind of like a personal protector. so if they can find your soul they can protect it. 

then you have kind of a variety of transitional forms, eventually culmunating in urban Hkar tradition that becomes mos numena, where the gods are these strong, powerful archetypes, with tons of power to grant miracles, but much less personal.



[2/2/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i pushed a religious history of taelgar brainstorming page that tries to centralize some of the strands/ideas about development of human religion on hkar and the impact on extant religious traditions


[2/2/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
I really like that as a general history. It seems to pull together the metaphysical underpinings of a lot of the strains of thought elsewhere and feels like it fits pretty well


[2/2/2024 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
I like the idea that Mos Numena develops by basically the process of re-definition of other gods as archetypes of a "bigger" god, which is a good explanation for how it becomes dominant


[2/2/2024 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
Somewhat unclear is an answer to how demons, devils, celestials, etc came into being


[2/2/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
There is the early idea (i.e. that Thandros expressed when we were hunting the gnolls) that human belief in hell created hell, but the mechanism of how it works in the context of the broad sweep of religious history is a little unclear


[2/2/2024 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i think on the one hand, this probably doesn't need a strictly canonical answer, there can be lots of ideas floating around in-game


[2/2/2024 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I didn't mean to suggest we need a strictly canonical answer


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
What  I really like about the doc you wrote is it provides a pretty solid working history which can be refered to make new things "fit" without being precisely prespective


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
however, i was trying to also set up the thread of the outer planes with the idea that, until the development of early pantheonic religions, there is no conception of gods having a home in the spiritual realms


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
they are manifestations of divine energy and conduits of divine energy that exist on the material plane


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but, that doesn't mean that no spiritual realms exist in this era


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
But in that context, I was noting that it doesn't help much with the worldbuilding challenge of "what's the background of this demon"


[2/2/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
Right. That makes sense, although I'm not sure I got it from the page


[2/2/2024 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i think this could be fleshed out more but one challenge is that i'm not sure what outer planes should exist in taelgar


[2/2/2024 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
canonically we have nine hells, abyss, pandemonium, arborea, and an unnamed prison dimension from the philosopher's guild note about the binding stones


[2/2/2024 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
(in addition to the realms of the gods)


[2/2/2024 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
but there could and probably will be more


[2/2/2024 2:08 PM] .deciusmus
This is where I feel like metaphysics helps. I feel like the fairly well-established metaphysics of the human religions helps clarify, for example, what the "right answer" is to an in-game question about what's going on at abandoned kestavo shrine that appears to be haunted.


[2/2/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
There doesn't need to be a deep and firm set of rules, but the skeleton makes it a lot easier to make up a consistent answer.


[2/2/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like that is kinda missing from the outer realms


[2/2/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
Not saying it has to be created now or anything, but its a gap in the Taelgar-ian metaphysics


[2/2/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, agreed. i kind of feel like it needs a bit more in-game exposure before it can be consolidated into metaphysics, though. 2025 is likely to involve a huge amount of extraplanar exploration in game so an answer might become clearer in 18 months


[2/2/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
I was about to say something similar, but with the added point that I'm pretty confident our game will get to outer plane stuff somewhat / long before my game does


[2/2/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
I expect to eventually be doing a fair bit with the Far Realms and weird abberations and stuff, but we are averaging ~10 sessions/year (6-7 hour in person sessions, so about twice the length of a DuFr session) so its probably more like late 2025/2026 (when we get to the last arc of my game)


[2/2/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
the far realms feels easier in a way since they are explicitly weird and alien and in some ways it is probably better if there isn't obvious rules or metaphysics that one can derive


[2/2/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
That is also true


[2/2/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
Although just because the danger is on the far realm doesn't mean that the solution isn't somewhere else


[2/2/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
true. 

separately though, i do think one more obvious question that is raised by the history i've sketched out and might be easier to answer now is what happens to the souls of Deno'qai, Zimka, etc. since the small gods don't inhabit spiritual realms, where do they go?


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
probably this is the same answer as where do the souls of people who died before the development of pantheonic religions go


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
one obvious option is reincarnation, but i'm not sure that is correct


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
I actually liked your answer of "beyond the veil"


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
Is there a need for a canonical answer?


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess probably not


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
I guess there are some implications, i.e. to Speak with Dead, Ressurection


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
if the soul is reincarnated, do those even work?


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
not so much speak with dead which doesn't summon the soul back to the body


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes ressurcetion would be impacted


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess speak with dead just animates the body to speak its experiences


[2/2/2024 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is best if there isn't one specific answer


[2/2/2024 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
I definitely don't think the Zimka believe in reincarnation, and I think in general in Taelgar most religious beliefs should align at least somewhat with metaphysical truths. But it seems useful to have enough flexibility in the metaphysics that a culture where reincarnation is true could exist (although it would probably have to be a small gods culture)


[2/2/2024 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the soul manifests where it goes


[2/2/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i would actually argue the opposite. a religion where souls are reincarnated would likely be a pantheonic religion where, rather than creating souls out of whatever to give people life, the gods send back souls in their domain


[2/2/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
^ yeah, fair point. That could certainly work as well


[2/2/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
But I was thinking of an ancestory worshipping, small gods religion where each soul is carried from the land of the dead to a new birth


[2/2/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
directly


[2/2/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the "default" metaphysics is that it is a one way journey, where souls are created out of ~divinity~ somehow (left completely mysterious) and then return to ~divinity~ in some way after passing through the land of the dead, but there is a lot of flexibilty for belief and for deities to reshape this


[2/2/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
How does this relate to the Plane of Souls/Plane of Consicousness?


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
not entirely clear, although plane of souls is some kind of manifestation of living souls only


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
it is basically the psionic equivalent of the plane of magic in some sense


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but fully on the "material plane" side of the land of the dead


[2/2/2024 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
right


[2/2/2024 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the distinction between primal realms and divine realms in my notes is kind of obselete. the basic idea is that the spiritual realms are divided into the proximate realms (dreamworld, plane of souls, astral plane, whatever else) and the outer planes, and those are divided by the land of the dead


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
i haven't quite worked out the metaphysics of like astral projection and such, and whether you can actually reach the outer planes from the astral plane, etc


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
where does primal magic come from?


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
and in some sense the plane of souls, astral plane, and the dreamworld might all be kind of part of the same metaphysical thing


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
the material plane


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
makes sense


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
primal magic is the echoes of the riving


[2/2/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
there is probably also a connection with fey magic to an extent, since metaphysically the echo realms (shadowfell, feywild, mirror realm so far) are effectively part of the material plane


[2/2/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
at some point someone will play a druid and i'll flesh some of this out in more detail


[2/2/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually so far everyone who has played a druid has just basically played a nature cleric with their magic as flavored as coming from gods, no one has actually played a metaphyiscally primal magic user


[2/2/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe i need to introduce a druid npc for a bit


[2/2/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I was going to say one of my players in the Ausson's Crossing miniseries played a dwarven druid, but he decided his magic came from the Baharazel


[2/2/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Where did Kyr's magic come from? Wasn't he "druidish"


[2/2/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
You need a human druid


[2/2/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, why does the (somewhat odd) D&D rule of primal magic actually have to exist in Taelgar? It isn't crazy to think that all magic is either divine or arcane, and a druid player basically chooses whether they are ultimately channeling the plane of magic or divine magi


[2/2/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, maybe. kyr's magic eventually ended up coming from the plane of consciousness in some sense, although metaphysics have shifted a bit since then


[2/4/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i assume you have no particular attachment to any particular details of this:
" In 1550, Rumors of an endless horde of orcs, and worse, reach Embry from Vostok in this time, and an embassy from several of the Vostok chieftains arrives, but is turned back with only a company of knights to support it, none of whom ever return to Sembara. But whatever chaos consumes the north, little of it reaches the Volta, save for rumors. But Jane and Bertram drop the title ‚ÄúHigh King of Vostok‚Äù from the royal titles and Vostok turns inward for its defenses. "


[2/4/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
no, none


[2/5/2024 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
were you changing that?


[2/5/2024 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
I presume you were working on backstory of vostok for the upcoming session

Great South Road:

An ancient road that runs from [[Embry]] to [[Cassons]]. In better days it ran south as far as [[Isingue]], and in the Drankorian era, was said to continue almost 2500 miles to [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] itself.

Although in poor repair in some places, for much of it's length it is paved with wide, smooth stones with drainage ditches on both sides. According to legend many of the stones in the road are a thousand years old, and have never cracked.

----

I'm working on some answers to my player's questions that depend on whether or not the Great South Road is in fact super-good road for travel, any concerns with the above?


[2/7/2024 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
no this is good, it should be semi-magical probably in places


[2/11/2024 9:27 AM] rsulfuratus
looking at your Sembara/lich email, a few thoughts. 

one thing that is not entirely clear to me is how much of this is supposed to be common knowledge in 1749. don't have to settle it all that soon but i think it shades how I think about some of the events you describe, and also might end up being relevant if the Dunmar group starts asking around about how to kill a lich


[2/11/2024 9:28 AM] rsulfuratus
so for example, "Battle of Something between Tollen and Sembara in 1720" fits in a lot better in the current 1749 vibe if it is widely known to be during the "lich interregnum"


[2/11/2024 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
I am definitely envisioning that the Lich interregnum is widely known


[2/11/2024 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
Some of the deeper plotting (ie relationship@with Umbraeth) probably secret and everyone would think the lich was totally defeated in summer 1720


[2/11/2024 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
Also when it started maybe not super clear.


[2/11/2024 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
But the six months from Jan - June 1720 would be widely known as ‚Äúlich interregnum‚Äù basically from when the dead arose from the ground in winter 1720 until when he was defeated in summer 1720


[2/11/2024 9:33 AM] rsulfuratus
right, okay


[2/11/2024 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
so I think what you describe fits fine with my feelingn about future history, then. the one thing I might say is that it might be slightly nicer to structure this as largely involving the south/west, and less tollen/highlanders, unless it is the only way to drive your players to tollen and you want them to go there


[2/11/2024 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
the reason is that this is the period of tollen expansion when e.g. there are pirate wars and tollen starts establishing dominance over western cymea


[2/11/2024 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
which works best if sembara sees tollen as a safe ally


[2/11/2024 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
but of course a short blip is fine if needed for your campaign


[2/11/2024 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
I don‚Äôt really want my players to be interested in Tollen right now. Post lich they might go there to investigate backstory (still working on who the lich is and where he came from)


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
I just wanted a second thrust to the plan for background. My players are invested in the ‚ÄúEnst river valley‚Äù pretty heavily so Wisford as a major center is perfect


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
But I don‚Äôt want it to feel like ‚Äúwisford vs the rest of sembara‚Äù


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
one option to change the tollen vibe a bit and perhaps play into tollen history is to have the lich intentionally to a terrible job dealing with piracy on the western gulf


[2/11/2024 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
that would be bad for telham and other coastal powers. maybe even telham is blamed for piracy


[2/11/2024 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
sembara has never been a major naval power but if piracy is growing as a problem in the early 1700s they are probably not completely ignoring it. until the lich, and maybe that provides the opening for tollen to be seen as a savior and end up really dominant


[2/11/2024 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
a thought, anyway


[2/11/2024 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
might even be a way to try to get one of the more coastal powers to raise their own army and then declare them a traitor for it as a second front


[2/11/2024 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
The other idea I had was the zimka it is just less made up. But for example the lich could claim the reason the dead are rising has something to do with the baleful influence of the lingering kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
Which sets up a conflict along the north/west border as a second front (and gives me an excuse to inject some kestavo lore into the game)


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, that works too. actually i think the "night queen has withdrawn her favor" seems a little hard to pull off, since it isn't like actual clerics would notice and feels big enough the gods would kind of push back a little? not directly but at least in dreams or whatever


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
so blaming foreign gods seems a lot easier for the lich to make work


[2/11/2024 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
although if you convince the people the elders of the night queen are lying, then it works better


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but it does seem like a riskier plan for the lich than blaming kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
Right I was envisionig the night queen thing leading with the lich executing a group of 8 or so elders of the night queen


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
But it does seem risky. The kestavo is probably a sounder plan


[2/11/2024 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
And more disruptive to sembara as well as it plays to natural tensions in society rather than trying to create new ones


[2/11/2024 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
that is a pretty good campaign hook for the campaign that the adventurers who end up killing the lich are part of: you start the campaign with everyone having a dream from the night queen summoning them on the quest


[2/11/2024 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
but i would probably go with kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
In the kestavo world it‚Äôs probably  one of the coastal dukes who‚Äôs secretly in league with the lich, and one of the highland dukes (chemin or arnsbury) who ends up revolting perhaps after an attempted/partially successful crackdown on kestavo.


[2/11/2024 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the Duke of Seham is the main Lich plant, and mismanages the pirates (maybe even secretly helping) with the goal of keeping Tollen occupied


[2/11/2024 9:58 AM] .deciusmus
So it isn‚Äôt that the lich wants conflict with Tollen, he just wants Tollen to be busy and to feel slighted by Sembara so aid from Tollen is more grudging, etc


[2/12/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
have you given much thought to lizardfolk family structure?


[2/12/2024 6:26 PM] .deciusmus
Also did you ever decide Vahiaya level/character class? They might show up leading a group of rangers soon in my game


[2/12/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
And I might need stats. I can just make something up if you didn't have ideas


[2/12/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
had some conversations with Eric about lizardfolk family structure - he played a lizardfolk in the Kenzo solo who was taking care of two babies. but we didn't decide much that was cannon, except a vague sense that a) they probably don't give live birth; b) the young at a very early age are probably mostly aquatic, but unclear when this stage ends, and unclear if this is like a tadpole stage or actual baby lizardfolk. 

from Eric's Mawar character have the sense that at least some lizardfolk have fairly traditional nuclear families at some point


[2/12/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Vahiaya - did not give much thought to a class, but figured probably mostly a martial - either straight fighter or a ranger. does not feel like a paladin to me


[2/12/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like having family structures and biology being (potentially, somewhat) more complex than "standard nuclear family like 1950s humans" for species - one of my players had a few ideas he was mucking around with (generically, not specifically for Taelgar) which struck me as potentially somewhat interesting for lizardfolk


[2/12/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking ranger


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems reasonable. only level constraint would be that in 1749 they are significantly weaker than you, so like 7-9th level at that point, if not lower


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
I was going with 3rd-5th


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
Haven't figured out hich is best


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
seems good


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
But they retire soon after the undead stuff


[2/12/2024 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
5th level in 1749 fine too, doesn't really matter to me


[2/12/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
don't necessarily disagree - my only pushback would be I don't want other species to end up in a situation where you need to read 5 pages of lore to play them "properly"


[2/12/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. Anyway not really something I was thinking about much, just offhand. Mostly trying to organize all the undead stuff and plan out a few things for my next session.


[3/6/2024 9:06 AM] .deciusmus
What do you think of Vahaiya as a 5th level fighter (arcane archer) specialized in bow, high dex, medium int/str, lowish wis/cha


[3/6/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
Sure


[3/12/2024 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
playing around with the new character reference option in midjourney. a younger Vahaiya, as a ranger

I have one player who can't make the Easter game, so the PCs are splitting up, with 3 of them going to Rinberg to investigate a monster that is dwelling in a lake near there, the other one going back to Cleenseau to bring news. He also might not be able to make April 28 in which case I am going to drag out the Rinberg adventure. If he can make APril 28, that would be the "Back in Cleenseau" and investigating fey stuff with Vahaiya game

[3/15/2024 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
been doing a little bit of NPC note cleanup, in part motivated by the cref option in midjourney making it easier to update old images to better quality new ones, which has motivated me to reorganize status tags a bit. 

curious what you feel the most useful things to track are and what is most important to be "canonical/shared" vs what we can use independently.

so far I am working from the following things I want to track, although this may be too fine grained and some of these can be combined:

## Needs Header Work or Reformatting

1) pages with complete text, but that need header information filled in from session notes or timelines (typically whereabouts and/or campaign info)
2) pages with complete text, but have complications that cannot be fully captured with the current header setup (e.g. a person who the party met as a ghost/undead but also has information about their past life)
3) pages with complete text, but which is not in the most useful format (e.g., history pages that would be better reorganized as a timeline)

## Needs Text

4) pages that need work on the text, where crucial details remain to be invented and so should not be considered complete
5) pages that need work on the text, where crucial details need to be copied from DM notes, session notes, or other notes

## Needs Verification / Validation

6) pages that need to be fact checked against other canonical information
7) pages with a name that needs consideration before it is considered canonical
8) pages that need a look over from someone else

## Other

9) pages that it would be nice to have an image or images for
10) empty pages that need basic header information
11) empty pages that need actual text


[3/15/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
some of these we already have good tags for (6 - status/factcheck, 7 - status/namecheck, 8 - status/tim, status/mike)


[3/15/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
9 - status/image
10 - status/stub


[3/15/2024 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
currently status/refactor is kind of both 2+3, and I'd like to split it to status/refactor (2) and status/reformat (3)


[3/15/2024 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
both status/internal and status/collate basically represent 1, and are used inconsistently. I would replace with status/header (or similar) to represent pages that are missing header details


[3/15/2024 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I would propose:
- status/blankslate for 11
- status/needswork for 4+5; probably don't need to distinguish, but if we want to, could use status/needswork/<> where <> could be notes, internal, wip (for "non-Obsidian info", "Obsidian info", "needs invention")


[3/15/2024 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also argue that status tags don't make sense for Campaigns and Worldbuilding, excepting maybe Worldbuilding/Background


[3/15/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I think the main thing id suggest is to try for 2 levels with the 2nd level optional


[3/15/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôd don‚Äôt care as much about the fine grained stuff as you


[3/15/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
For me the main things are:
The page needs work or invention
This page is mostly complete but needs some ‚Äúcleanup‚Äù
This page is basically just a name placeholder


[3/15/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder if something like
Status/cleanup
Status/needswork
Status/stub

And then sub levels like
Status/cleanup/facts
Status/cleanup/header 
Etc


[3/15/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
Cleanup means ‚Äúreasonable complete, should be considered canonicalish‚Äù


[3/15/2024 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
Needswork means ‚Äúmissing large gaps. The information here is still being developed‚Äù


[3/15/2024 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, okay, that works well


[3/15/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
Stub means: this is an empty page, I (the creator of the page) don‚Äôt really have any ideas about it other than the name


[3/15/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
Then keep factcheck namecheck mike tim as separate


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so the top level would be:
stub
factcheck
namecheck
mike
tim
cleanup
needswork


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
that works for me


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
oh, also, I'd like to add a status/image as a toplevel tag


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Why not status/cleanup/image?


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don‚Äôt care either way


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
running stuff through midjourney is very easy to do when I'm e.g. on a boring meeting on Zoom


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so to me it feels pretty distinct from other cleanup tasks


[3/15/2024 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, either way


[3/15/2024 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
which typically involve collating information across notes which involves a lot more concentration


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
do you know of a way to get the word count of a note in dataview or dataviewJS? I want to make a query to find highly linked notes with litte/no text


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'm sure there is a way to do it in js


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
but I don't know offhand


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe I will poke around a bit


[3/15/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a lot of things tagged "status/stub" that have complete headers but no other text. I think these are left over from old uses of stub, as by the current definition stub should mean "this page needs a header". I am planning on removing the stub tag from pages with complete headers, even if they have litte/no text, unless you object


[3/15/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
I think it might be worth reviewing to make sure status/stub doesn't need to be status/needswork


[3/15/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. Duchy of Wisford should be status/needswork, not status/stub


[3/15/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
whereas The Salty Squid is probably just "remove the tag" unless you have some notes on the place


[3/15/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
things that also have status/unknown fine to just remove


[3/15/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
it would really only be a page that has ONLY status/stub where it is obviously something that should have more info


[3/15/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
I am actually trying to just clear all the status/stub pages by adding headers to things that are missing them, and then adding status/needswork as relevant

[3/15/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
the reason for the note lenght query is to have an independent check for "short notes that are marked as complete" so I can go back and add status/needswork to ones that are important enough to need text


[3/15/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
right, makes sense


[3/15/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
Do you think that there are more fey (i.e. dryads, satyrs, etc) living on Taelgar in Tyrwingha than other places? Or do you think its more one way, i.e. there are a lot of portals, but mostly that means humans -> feywild more than fey -> Tyrwingha?


[3/15/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't really thought about it. but probably yes

pushed a major status tag update. i've reviewed all the "completed" pages (except people), and IMO all are accurately assigned to the correct status (that is, complete)


[3/15/2024 7:41 PM] rsulfuratus
the "status/unknown" ones are a bit more daunting, as there are ~750 of them, but many are in campaign directories where status tags aren't really useful

[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed an update to Tyrwingha... would be interested in your opinoin. Also here:

Tyrwingha is a rural place, with no cities of any size outside of [[Tafolwern]], and most people live in small villages and market towns of between 50 and 1000 people. 

Unlike in [[Sembara]], where themanor  is the main unit of political organization, Tyrwingha is fundamentally organized, from the bottom, around the village, and from the top, around the earls. 

In ancient days, the title of Earl was said to be bestowed only on those human lords who had sworn a direct oath to [[Archfey Ethlenn]] to serve and obey her, and were thus seen as her stewards in the human realms, watching over the land and its inhabitants on her behalf. Today, these earls, of which there are about fifty, are powerful lords, whose bond to Ethlenn derives from their allegiance to the monarch. The earls have a duty to watch over the land on behalf of Ethlenn, and usually they spend at least six months of the year travelling with their retainers and court.


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Each earl has a circuit, which they ride, and a set of villages and towns on that circuit, for which they are responsible. The earl is obligated to provide, to their villages and towns, justice, defense, and charity. The villages are obligated to provide to the earl, labor service. This labor service is traditionally a year of labor for every ten hearths in the village. This can take many forms: in some cases, it is someone joining the earl's travelling court, or the Army of Mostreve. In other cases, it is working the earl's land, in which it is more usually divided up, i.e. six people working the land during harvest and planting, rather than one person for a whole year.

The earl, in turn, is responsible for providing to each village:
* Justice, in the form of appeals from the village Court of All (see below)
* Defense, via their own force of arms, and their retainers
* Charity, in the form of support in hard times, managing the redistribution of food and so on


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Villages are usually self-organized, and the Sembaran model of a manoral lord who oversees the village is not typically seen in Tyrwingha (although a small number of Sembaran style manors do exist along the Aure and the border with Sembara).

Village organization is varied, but all villages manage disputes via the Court of All. This is a village gathering that is empowered to judge and punish crimes, settle disputes between neighbors, and make decisions about how the village will fulfil its labor service to Ethlenn and the earl's.

The Court of All is consisted as an assembly of the village, with one representative for each hearth. So the very poor have no representation, and the wealthy somewhat disproportionate representation, but in many villages there are neither wealthy nor poor, and the general vibe is usually fairly democratic.


[3/17/2024 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
was away from my computer all afternoon yesterday, looking at this now


[3/17/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
I would make a few subtle tweaks. 

I think that the fundamental relationship with Ethlenn is less about land (e.g., I'm not sure it makes sense to say that all land in Tyrwingha is held in trust for Ethlenn), and more about obligations of service and protection. 

I like the way you've set up earls, but I'd frame it more explicitly like almost a fey bargain. Ethlenn has offerred her protection over the land, and in turn asks for service from the people.

I kind of imagine that long ago, before Drankor, this was more explicitly about a bargain between the people and Ethlenn, and the service might often involve someone spending a year in the feywild. 

Subsequently, this has evolved, and the earls kind of function like a stand-in. 

I think this is the vibe you were going for, yes?

But the land holding stuff doesn't really fit to me, since it would be weird for a fey lord to have an interest in *land* on the material plane, imo.


[3/17/2024 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense. It is the vibe I was going for.


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
But I also wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to pull in the full complexity of sembaran land holdings. In particular I like the distinction of not being so based around manors, and being more based on service obligations than taxes on land


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
But I agree the ‚ÄúEthlenn owns the land‚Äù is probably the wrong vibe


[3/17/2024 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
I think I would just basically make all land in Tyrwinghan effectively what Sembarans would call folkland


[3/17/2024 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
except that since there is no taxation on land, there is no reason you can't sell it


[3/17/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
the Court of All in a village is responsible for, among other things, land records and deeds, and so you get a bit of a New England town hall vibe where the village can block a sale they don't want, which tends to make villages a bit insular I guess


[3/17/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
I like that actually though


[3/17/2024 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think it works. so basically you have the following:
- a somewhat feudal relationship with Ethlenn, which is based on obligations of service and protection, although practically speaking the earls serve as a stand in for Ethlenn, and claim the service obligations and provide protection (although, there are probably cases in Tywinghan common law where an earl was unable to get the service from a particular village some year because they had instead done something directly for Ethlenn; there might be some tie in with the army and warlocks here)
- a fairly "modern" concept of private property rights
- a heavily rural, village based society where the Court of All controls a lot of aspects of life in a village, with kind of a New England town hall vibe, which probably means there can be a lot of village-to-village variability


[3/17/2024 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus
Left unsaid are how earls are chosen. Are these hereditary nobility now? I guess yes, although perhaps would be worth considering some variants


[3/17/2024 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
My thinking is that technically, like the electors, the earls are supposed to be put forward by the existing body of earls and accepted by Ethlenn


[3/17/2024 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
But in practice, silence is interpreted as acceptance and so mostly children follow parents.  But it‚Äôs formally an elected position where the existing earls are the electors


[3/17/2024 10:36 AM] .deciusmus
So there is some variability especially when an earl dies unexpectedly, ie before having had a chance to have their heir officially selected


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
(The idea being that ‚Äúearls heir‚Äù is a position in its own right, and most earls will arrange for their chosen heir to be elected as the earl-in-waiting before they die)


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think that works


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
But occasionally Ethlenn actually does intervene, and other times politics intervenes, so it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúby right‚Äù that the position inherits like it is in sembara


[3/17/2024 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
What is relationship between earls and the crown?


[3/17/2024 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm‚Ä¶ I think the earls should be subservient to the crown but kinda forgot about the crown in the above


[3/17/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
One possible history could be that originally (pre-Drankor), you just had earls, no crown. The earls were basically Ethenn‚Äôs court on the material plane


[3/17/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
Then in the deal with Drankor, ethenn creates the royal electors, at this point the advisors to drankor or whatever who have to formally approve whoever is proposed for governor of the province


[3/17/2024 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
The earls still exist and are fairly independent of the Drankorian hierarchy


[3/17/2024 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
Part of the deal, perhaps, is that certain matter of local organization are devolved to the earls still


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Maybe in the early days post Drankor the monarch is actually quite weak, and the power of the monarch kind of depends on the extent to which the monarch is seen as the actual representative of Ethlenn on the material plane


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Formally speaking the monarch is always supposed to be that


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
So earls would owe allegiance kind of analogously to a reagent


[3/17/2024 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
I like that so far‚Ä¶


[3/17/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
could even imagine that the early tales of the earls of Tyrwingha have a bit of a "knights of the round table" vibe, with Ethlenn as the king arthur standin. Maybe "earl" is actually an old Tyrwinghan word for knight

{Reactions}
üëç

[3/17/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
I think this would imply that the earls are kind of an independent power base; it is only the assumption/belief that Ethlenn will directly intervene to keep things from going too far off the rails that keeps things working, since in some sense the earls don't actually owe any formal allegience to the monarch themsevles. they owe allegience to Ethlenn, and thus to the monarch as Ethlenn's mortal representative


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
I do think the electors should have more power/something here. The oracle of the riven is envisioned as 7 high level warlocks.


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the third pillar I'd add is that probably the Oracles of the Riven and the elite warlock cadre in the army should have some connection and perhaps more active power than is described


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
ha yes


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
jinx


[3/17/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
It is also interesting the relationship with sembara


[3/17/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the Tyrwinghan monarchy is quite weak, and all the times it doubles up with sembara works relatively well because basically the monarch focuses on sembara


[3/17/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
right, I can sort of envision that in times of peace, or in times of dire war, Tyrwingha gets a lot out of a close personal alliance with Sembara, and doesn't give up much, since functionally speaking it doesn't really make any different to the people of Clawyn or wherever who the warlocks say the mortal representative of Ethlenn is


[3/17/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
the real question is what does Ethlenn get out of it?


[3/17/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
and also what does Sembara get out of it?


[3/17/2024 11:01 AM] .deciusmus

[3/17/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
So riffing on what you said above, what about something like this:

In the ancient times, Ethlenn's earls were effectively her court in the mortal realm, and it would have been common for them to spend some time in the Feywild.  The idea of earls having circuits of villages, and villages owning service to Ethlenn via the earls would date to this time.

When Ethlenn made her deal with Drankor, part of the deal was specifically to create the Oracle of the Riven, which in turn had veto power over the Drankorian governer of the province. The Oracle was also the vehicle by which Ethlenn learned magical secrets from Drankor.

Over the many years of Drankorian rule, Ethlenn fades a little bit into the background, and the earls intermix with the Drankorian elite and start to acquire land and more mudane interests. The ideal of the earls as Ethlenn's knights-errant doesn't vanish, but it is less and less likely a specific earl lives up to that ideal. 

The Drankorian provincial governer has little power over the countryside, but does become something of a powerful figure in Tafolvern (and perhaps, the entire city is only founded in the Drankrorian era)


[3/17/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
The earls also start to spend less / no time in the Feywild, replacing it with time in Tafolvern, where the governer is based, and the governer grows into a position that resolves disputes amongst the earls


[3/17/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
The Oracle of the Riven becomes the focus on Ethlenn's interest, esp because of the magical aspect


[3/17/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
When Drankor falls, and danger comes, the position of monarch develops initially as effectively the Oracle's appointed army commander. The warlock cadres date from the time just after Drankor falls, when Tyrwingha has to look to its own defense, and the core of what later becomes the Army of Mostreve dates from this time as well


[3/17/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Over the years, the balance of power generally develops as:

* The monarch is the commander in chief of the army, and is responsible for the safety of the borders of Tyrwingha, and for foreign relations, and acts as a spokesperson for the Oracle of the Riven. 
* In the tradition of the Drankoria governer, the monarch is also the one who is empowered to resolve disputes between the earls. 

But the monarch has little say in the actual governance of the country


[3/17/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Derik III originally accepts the Tyrwinghan crown basically because he wants to be the commander in chief of an army of warlocks


[3/17/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
His heirs are given the Tyrwinghan crown because Ethlenn/the Oracle of the Riven wants Sembara to be responsible for the defense of the borders of Tyrwinghan - safety in numbers, basically


[3/17/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that works quite well


[3/17/2024 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
And actually the post-Great War history of Sembaran and Tyrwinghan kings works perfectly for the idea that the Oracle is effectively being told by Ethlenn when to align with Sembara (because of say, upcoming hobgoblin wars) vs when not to (because the Sembaran king is going to be weak)


[3/17/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I think in modern Tyrwingha, the Oracle is the ultimate authority and are the ones who are still perceied as Ethlenn's advisors. The monarch's authority comes from the Oracle's support.

The Oracle of the Riven maybe is also responsible for selecting earls. That is, it isn't the whole group of earl's who pick new ones, it is also the Oracle


[3/17/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
So you have this shadowy, clearly fey aligned group that is widely still seen to speak for Ethlenn, picking both the monarch and the earls


[3/17/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually kind of like the earls being elected by their peers, as opposed to the Oracle. I think it sets up more interesting political possibilities than if it is just a shadowy council that controls everything


[3/17/2024 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I can see that


[3/17/2024 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the monarch as commander of the army provides a pretty significant check on the ability of the earls to become too independently powerful - and since the core strength of the Tywinghan army is a cadre of warlocks personally obligated to Ethlenn they can't be made to act against Ethlenn's interests


[3/17/2024 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
this also provides incentive for Sembara to invest in a personal union of the crowd. as Sembara is fairly weak in magic


[3/17/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but also explains why it is always just a personal union of the crowns, and Tyrwingha despite a long history is never incorporated into Sembara directly


[3/17/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
it would probably be good to have some rumors or lore about what the people of Tyrwingha think about Ethlenn's motives, although I think it is probably better to leave the truth unclear


[3/17/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe your player who is writing the 5000 word backstory can come up with some theories about what Ethlenn gets out of all of this


[3/17/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus

[3/21/2024 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the only fundamental thing about magic is that all magic in taelgar represents the manipulation of extranplanar forces in some way. there is a "magic in taelgar" note in worldbuilding/brainstorming


[3/21/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I have always thought of divine magic (whether technically a cleric or someone like Delwath who is not mechanically a cleric but gets magic from divine beings) as effectively just praying in a some kind of particular way


[3/21/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
(although Delwath is a bit weird here since early on he did not know the source of his power was a god)


[3/21/2024 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
you - as the spellcaster - aren't really doing anything, particularly, except opening a path for divine magic to reach the material plane


[3/21/2024 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
(this bit is pretty undeveloped but the basic idea is the land of the dead acts as kind of a barrier and gods cannot easily reach past it, but living souls allow them to "tunnel" in a way)


[3/21/2024 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
a wizard (or an "arcane-feeling" bard, like Seeker) would be basically manipulating residue leakage/energy from the plane of magic, represented by ley lines

sorcerers and warlocks depend on the source of their magic. e.g., Cintra (divine soul sorcerer) was not manipulating residual energy of the plane of magic, she is a personal direct channel that allows Shakun to act through her


[3/21/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the echo realms in various forms (feywild, shadowfell, dreamworld, etc) were "spun out" from Taelgar almost by accident when the material plane was created by the High Gods during the Riving, and that act left resonaces / echos that can also be manipulated


[3/21/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
this is where fey magic, probably also primal magic, some forms of necromancy, etc comes from


[3/21/2024 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
this is probably somewhat in-between the cleric "I am a channel for a god to act" and the wizard "I can see and feel strands of arcane magic running across the world that I pull and twist to create spells"


[3/21/2024 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
as far as what the gods and the fey think of each other - I guess it would depend a lot on the individual fey, and perhaps the individual god. I don't think there needs to be a settled standard approach here. 

fey are ultimately the grandchildren of the High Gods, via the archfey. some archfey probably see themselves basically as gods themselves and might consider especially e.g. the embodied gods of the elves as peers. they might consider some of the weaker human gods (tanshi, kestavo) as effectively lesser than them


[3/21/2024 1:19 PM] rsulfuratus
one key point is the echo realms are actually harder to reach for the gods than the material plane (they are even further from the divine realms), so gods would be particularly weak in the echo realms


[3/21/2024 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/21/2024 1:20 PM] .deciusmus
That all makes sense, although when bounced against D&D rules there is a little question of why clerics have to prepare spells


[3/21/2024 1:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think from Celyn's perspective, the basic idea Kiya hinted at - where the fey magic feels like work and the divine magic feels like a gift - fits pretty well


[3/21/2024 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
3 of the 4 characters in my game have the fey touched feat, so there is a a second question I'm trying to answer about how is that different from other magic (although only Kiya of my 4 players seems interested in delving into what it feels like to cast spells in Taelgar)


[3/21/2024 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yes - I like the "misty step is something you have to work at to learn to do" angle


[3/21/2024 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean from a overarching point of view I think the key thing to decide is "what extraplanar energy are you manipulating" and "how are you doing it". with possible answers for the first one ranging from "plane of magic" to "feywild" to "plane of souls (this is probably psionics)" to "divine realms" and many things in between


[3/21/2024 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
how you are doing it could be anything from "arcane rituals" to "prayers"


[3/21/2024 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
basically to cast a spell you need a) a power source and b) a way to manipulate / manifest that power source in the material plane


[3/21/2024 1:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense.


[3/21/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but, to take the cleric example, you could imagine all of the following "divine magic users":
- a person born with an innate connection to a particular god, whose soul/spirit/consciousness functions as a conduit allowing the divine energy of the deity to effortlessly flow to the material plane, requiring only that the person learn how to shape the power flowing through them (a divine soul sorcerer)
- a Lakan mystai who has studied the secret prayers and rituals of Laka and learned how to manipulate the resonances of the prayers that flow across the material plane (a wizard)
- a character like Riswynn who is a very traditional "pray to the gods" cleric
- a character like Delwath who I'm not actually sure exactly how he casts spells but it usually feels more like asking for a favor from a particular spirit than praying I think

all those people could be manipulating divine magic in various ways, with very different mechanics

[3/21/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway I have a meeting now but maybe I'll update the magic in taelgar notes later today


[3/21/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I was thinking about Delwath, I think he has a specific relationship with the tanshi and has almost worked together with each one to craft special abilities. 

So asking for a favor works pretty well as a vibe, but I think he has additionally basically collaborated with each tanshi so that there are these specific favors from each one that work well


[3/21/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
doing a little note cleanup. why did you have the eight divines tagged status/tim? maybe just the symbols for the father and the night queen?


[3/21/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I think so


[3/21/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm taking the status/tim tags off them

[3/23/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
writing next session - wondering about Delwath's general scrying patterns. assume that, since arriving in Zvervinka, you are not trying to secertly scry in your rooms at night or anything, but let me know if that is not the case. prior to arriving, assume Delwath generally keeps an eye on Chardon, Sura/Karnas, maybe Xurkhaz, but isn't deeply scrying one person unless you tell me


[3/23/2024 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
That sounds about right


[3/24/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
As Kiya - my player  currently writing lots of backstory - writes stuff, it occurred to me that maybe one of the things the fey do in Tyrwingha is protect the place from other weirdness. 

Sembara has a lot of guards and walls around towns, but I think that‚Äôs much less common in Tyrwingha. The wild places are full of fey, instead, and although some fey can be dangerous, many fey instead scare off - directly or indirectly - other dangers


[3/24/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
This is part of why there is a tradition in Tyrwinghan villages, especially rural ones, of watching and maintaining fey spaces. People might not understand exactly the bargain, but ultimately having fey around helps keep these small villages safe


[3/24/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
Thoughts?


[3/24/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
I like it - I would add that it is probably precisely because of the tradition of watching and tending the fey spaces that the fey help, in a sense. it isn't just having fey around, it is maintaining the fey bargain that keeps the village safe


[3/24/2024 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that‚Äôs the implication I was going for


[3/24/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
so you might have tales of villages where something went wrong, they were attacked by zombies or whatever, and the assumption is that someone forgot to tend to the fey. maybe that is actually what happened

{Reactions}
üëç

[3/24/2024 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
Although I‚Äôm not sure people in a Tyrwinghan village would necessarily know or see it as ‚Äúkeeping us safe‚Äù vs ‚Äúmaintaining ancient tradition‚Äù


[3/24/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
i think not precisely keeping us safe, but I think there would be an understanding of some kind of bargain. the fey are not unconditional allies, but if you maintain the traditions and rites, you village has good luck and prospers, and if you don't, you have bad luck


[3/24/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/24/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that‚Äôs perfect


[3/24/2024 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
in fact this could ultimately play back into the bargain with Ethlenn. maybe for some reason Ethlenn's realm became something of a haven for many fey who missed the material world after the Riving, and part of her deal with Tyrwingha is precisely to leave space for her fey subjets who want to return to the material plane


[3/24/2024 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the full history is probably more complicated but that could be part of it


[3/24/2024 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
Ah, I like that.


[3/25/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
I was doing a little tag cleanup in between meetings... there is a set of pages that I'm not sure the right status... 

For example, the Abyss. The page right now is just "The realm of corruption and chaos, home of demons. " But for most purposes, that is actually a complete page. Is it worth making it status/needswork because clearly there is more to it than that? Or is it better to just make it no-status to indicate its done for now?


[3/25/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
Or should we have a new status tag for things that are clearly insufficiently detailed but seem good enough as long as they are only "observed from afar"


[3/25/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
This comes up a lot in places as well...

For example, I made up a town along the Wistel, Gowerbourne, just to have a place to have a distant battle be occuring at...


[3/25/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
The page has no real information, but it is "enough" unless someone decides to go there


[3/26/2024 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
I think status tags are best used only to indicate "there is canon or near-canon information about this page that is not on this page."


[3/26/2024 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
Right so that suggests that, i.e. the Abyss and Gowerbourne should both have empty status tags


[3/26/2024 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think so


[3/26/2024 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
but, if for example, I had introduced a bunch of stuff about Gowerbourne to my players in email, but not yet in obsidian, i'd make it needs work

And if you had a bunch of backstory notes about the Abyss that impacted events in game but were not cleaned up for obisidian, you might set Abyss to "needs work"

And maybe for a page like "Embry" where although I don't have specific facts or notes, the general 'vibe' has come out in game and clearly there should be a couple of sentences before calling it done, I'd add a needswork as well, not to write a long Tollen-style page, but just to have something


[3/26/2024 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I've tended to mark things needswork either because I have explicit notes I need to clean up and add, or because I have a sense of the place that isn't well captured in the current text even if I don't have explicit notes

{Reactions}

[3/26/2024 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
ok, that's good guidance


[3/26/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I've been switching status/unknown to status/tim on pages I didn't write that "look" complete to me but I'm not sure if you have stuff to add


[3/26/2024 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I saw that, cleaning up some of those now


[3/26/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
feel free to give your cleric a permanent magic something and one or three consumables, or if you don't, I might drop a few in


[3/27/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
poking around a little bit in your Sembara notes thinking about a backstory for the cleric, and thinking about the Enst dynamic. Fellburn feels like it needs a good anchor that is not primarily economic to me


[3/27/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. I was struggling with that a little bit


[3/27/2024 1:38 PM] .deciusmus
Why does Fellburn matter?

I like the idea that pre-hobgoblin wars Rinburg was another major tradiing area, but post-war hasn't rebuilt the bridge for various reasons. But why does anyone live in Fellburn?


[3/27/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
I was looking at big french cities in 1400 and pretty much they are all on bridges over rivers


[3/27/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, although there are plenty of counterexamples (the Nile was not bridged for most of pre-modern history as far as I can tell)


[3/27/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i think bridge/no bridge is easy to hand wave, perhaps for hydrological reasons if nothing else, but it means Fellburn needs a reason to exist that isn't "trade nexus"


[3/27/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
Right I wasn‚Äôt super clear. What I mean is that looking at late medieval France ‚Äúexistence of a bridge‚Äù was a pretty good way to get an important city. Not to imply only way


[3/27/2024 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, right, sure


[3/27/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
Dijon is the only main example I could find that didn‚Äôt have a significant bridge and it became large because of Italian trade fairs


[3/27/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
Ie it was a convenient place for Italian and French merchants to meet


[3/27/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think from the existing Sembara notes, the puzzle is that you basically have this history of the Enst as sembaran borderlands, with all the major cities being sacked at one point or another, but also the vibe (perhaps not canon?) of Fellburn growing faster than Rinburg in recent times and expanding from a more minor city to bigger/more important than Rinburg


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] .deciusmus
That vibe is definitely not canon


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Rinburg is a natural economic powerhouse even absent bridge, given location at height of navigation and presence of major cermanic industry


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
so you can see the vibe of "even though the city was burned, it is a natural place to rebuild"


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and the bridge is not economically important because most trade runs east-west not north-south


[3/27/2024 1:47 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/27/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not quite sure what the vibe of the small baronies between the Enst and Addermarch is supposed to be in the current day - this was all land that was essentially completely depopulated during hobgoblin wars


[3/27/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing that matters about fellburn canonically is it needs a reason to be worth fighting for.  It has a big skeletal problem entirely because it was the site of several major battles including some sembaran defeats  so lots and lots of unburied dead all over.


[3/27/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
Yeh I‚Äôve been avoiding writing up Vahaiyas ‚Äúhow I came to be north of the Enst‚Äù story because I am not quite sure what the borderlands are like


[3/27/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think it was an area of intense resettlement by Cece and a very specific attempt to have more barons directly dependent on the crown


[3/27/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I have always thought of this land as relatively marginal


[3/27/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to poke around for a good real-world parallel


[3/27/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
A lot of court favorites getting land etc from the crown directly. But I‚Äôm not sure how that plays out later and I‚Äôm not committed to it


[3/27/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
It can‚Äôt be that marginal if Wisford is the breadbasket of semabara and it‚Äôs just on the other side of the river


[3/27/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess it could be the wistel / north half of wisford that is extremely productive


[3/27/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
And the Enst valley kinda marginal


[3/27/2024 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so, thinking a bit more about the climate and topography. i think that there are hills / highlands along the southern border of Tyrwingha, the southern border of Addermarch, but then also wrapping around and extending north. you can see from the river topography that Addermarch is basically a bit of a basin inside the Mostreve Hills, which probably isolates it a bit and also means Addermarch looks downriver more than overland into Sembara


[3/27/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
this probably means the land slopes down from the mostreve hills to the enst, with more topological variation on the south side than the north side


[3/27/2024 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
the actual Sembaran lowlands extend from the Enst to the Teft, but probably only stretch a little ways south of the Enst


[3/27/2024 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
so in your Borderlands, Estrive/Monste/Vauclaire are probably good agricultural land, but everything south of that might not be


[3/27/2024 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense. So you have hilly terrain in the southern 2/3rds of the borderlands


[3/27/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
it might be something like Provence, but if you imagine that, for whatever reason, it is not suitable for vinticulture, you are left without much. animal husbandry and maybe some orchards


[3/27/2024 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
or the southern applachas


[3/27/2024 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
*appalachians


[3/27/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
In the hobgoblin wars timeline, I have the Shattered Ice Clan basically settling the entire region 
(a) north of the Mostreve Hills
(b) south of the Enst
(c) west of the Aure

So Addermarch is on the southern border, and the entire borderlands and northern 1/3 of Maseau is under hobgoblin control for 45 years


[3/27/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
Although I'm not sure if I really meant the Aure, as the rest of the history isn't that consistent with that


[3/27/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so here is a random image of the Danube from the internet that maybe gets the Enst vibe a little bit:

[3/27/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
why not the Aure?


[3/27/2024 2:16 PM] .deciusmus
Just that the history isn't consistent...

- (DR:: 1602): The lands south of the Enst and west of the Aure are ceded to the hobgoblins. 
(DR:: 1644), late fall/winter: The [[Shattered Ice Clan]] breaks the fortifications in [[Barony of Vaubonne|Vaubonne]] and camps outside [[Fellburn]]


[3/27/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
if the land as far east as the Aure is under hobgoblin control, what are "the fortifications" in Vaubonne?


[3/27/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
that would also be under hobgoblin control


[3/27/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
Unless you imagine the 3rd hobgoblin war starts with a major sembaran success, which pushes the hobgoblins very far west, and then a collapse


[3/27/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
But none of that history has to be canonical


[3/27/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
it could actually work well for the entire area south of the Enst to be hobgoblin for 50 years


[3/27/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I would probably make the Enst the de facto southern border of Sembara from 1602 - 161653


[3/27/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
*1653


[3/27/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
Then you could imagine something like

in the 1600s, you have Cleenseau and Rinburg both with bridges to hobgoblin terriority, and Cleenseau builds up an army, but Rinburg makes a go at economics, trading with the hobgoblins, etc

Fellburn because the main garrison town and where the "cold war" with the hobgoblins is focused. 

Then when the 3rd hobgoblin war breaks out, after some early successes Rinburg and Cleenseau are both occupied.

But Fellburn, although it is sacked in 1647, is never really occupied. It is quickly retaken after the sack


[3/27/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
the only problem is the garrison at Fellburn would not then leave to fight in western Masseau


[3/27/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so you have to change the early part of the 3rd hobgoblin war


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
- (DR:: 1644), fall: After several early successes, the Sembaran [[Army of the South]] is fought to a stalemate at the [[Battle of Lysandale]] in the western reaches of Maseau


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
yeah to make that work


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but that could be the Dunfry garrison instead, the army of the west


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
You had some secret reason/idea behind why the hobgoblins started up again


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
But the flow of the war still works fine with the focus initially being a western campaign, focused on maseau, with the western army of sembara


[3/27/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
and the southern army - based in fellburn - is defensive


[3/27/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I need to draw it out to visualize the territorial changes more clearly


[3/27/2024 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
something like:

1600

[3/27/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but getting back to Fellburn and the border baronies, I think this still leaves a slight puzzle, because Fellburn is not naturally positioned as a defensive location. so I think Fellburn should have something worth defending to motivate the garrison


[3/27/2024 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
it is kind of a weird shape. why do the hobgoblins push so far west, especially if the border baronies are kind of marginal land?


[3/27/2024 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
1645

[3/27/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is less marginal than the northern third of Maseau, which is hill and also dry


[3/27/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
But Sembara has the ability and will to defend the Enst, so isn't going to give up land north of the Enst. It is a strategic sacrifice on the Sembaran side to give up marginal land to avoid a bloody battle defending the Enst, which the hobgoblins take for similar reasons


[3/27/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Simiarly, the core of Maseau (the southern 1/3 or so where the land is better) is where almost all the people of Maseau live, so they are going to defend their homes to the death. But the northern parts are mostly empty, so easy for the hobgoblins to move in


[3/27/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not entirely sure what is canon and what is speculation at this point, but why not have the hobgoblins move east instead of stretching their territory? at the end of the first hobgoblin war (more or less Sembaran victory) they are confined to what is quite marginal land in western Maseau and Enford; second hobgoblin war starts basically because the hobgoblins want better land, and is more-or-less a hobgoblin victory


[3/27/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
so at the end of 2nd war the hobgoblin territory is basically a crescent north + west of addermarch

the only bit that's canon is Cleenseau needs to be occupied by hobgoblins ~1645 - 1650 ish


[3/27/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
basically all that changes here is that perhaps there is something of a frozen conflict in western maseau (west of road, south of enford), where the land is not worth big effort and you have a bit of back and forth with maseau but semabara doesn't get involved, having driven hobgoblins south of enst


[3/27/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
then initially 3rd hobgoblin war starts in the west, for mysterious reasons the hobgoblins launch a major offensive, sembara gets nervous about dunfry, and things procede


[3/27/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
then I think you get the following vibes:
- Cleanseau and Rinburg are economically central to the Enst river trade network, and despite occupation / destruction in the 1650 +/- spring back strong; it is possible that one or both actively trades with hobgoblins
- Fellburn is an important city for cultural / religious / historical reasons despite being economically less vibrant than Rinburg, is better defended and seen as something that cannot be lost
- Borderlands south of Enst are fully under hobgoblin rule; people remain in places, but as the Radiant Alliance closes in reprisals are pretty brutal and most structures are burned, so as of 1653 this is quite barren / unpopulated land


[3/27/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
- Addermarch becomes very isolated from Sembara in this period, and draws much closer to Tyrwingha


[3/27/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
(Addermarch has always felt more culturally connected to Tyrwingha anyway)


[3/27/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
(I have a meeting so might be slow to respond)


[3/27/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
So I think what this needs is just a good reason for Sembara to care about Fellburn and for a significant population center there. 

One obvious option is a religious site. Sembara doesn't really have religious organizations per se so the site of an abbey or something probably doesn't work, but you could imagine almost a Bath-like vibe if Fellburn is the site of magical healing waters or something else magical and religious that would drive pilgrimages


[3/27/2024 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Another obvious option is a extraplanar weak point, which could have various and sundry impacts


[3/27/2024 3:04 PM] rsulfuratus
it feels like a magical explanation is correct here, and probably something that predates Drankor, which would potentially make Fellburn a very old area of settlement


[3/27/2024 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I am thinking that the cleric I'm making up is in his mid-50s, so his parents were probably born sometime between 1635-1645. i think that perhaps he has a family connection to Fellburn - his mother fled the sack of Fellburn when she was 10 or 12, or something like that


[3/27/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
still haven't figured out what he was doing before he found magic late in life, stay tuned


[3/27/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
I think this is all good


[3/27/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
So basically the hobgoblin wars timeline needs to change a little so that 
early part of war is fighting in the west and large defensive buildup along the enst
middle part of war is parts of the enst line collapse, but not all, and perhaps fellburn is never actually sacked and a valiant defense of fellburn holds out
late part of war is pushing hobgoblins west


[3/27/2024 3:37 PM] .deciusmus
I like magical explanation for Fellburn being important; I am not sure I like magic healing waters as that is too similar to Isingue I think


[3/27/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, just grabbing that as it is why Bath was an important place in the real world


[3/27/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
but playing on Fellburn, could be something like an eternal flame that magically burns and supposedly removes curses (maybe once an ancient kestavan site). or an oracle of some kind. perhaps kind of a strange oracle - not necessarily divine magic


[3/27/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe a mythical defender - the phoenix of fellburn or something like that, although probably don't want an actual phoenix just hanging out in fellburn


[3/27/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the key feature is something that drives pilgrimages which in turn drives the economy and growth of the city


[3/27/2024 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
right


[3/27/2024 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
A pushed a slight cleanup to timeline of Sembaran history to incorporate the above


[3/27/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
Only bit I am not sure if is if Fellburn should actually be sacked, or if the hobgoblins are repelled. Probably depends on the nature of what is in Fellburn


[3/27/2024 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I'm trying to think of a good idea for that, need to let it simmer for a bit


[3/27/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
The Fell Burn, the Beacon of Fate in the ancient language of the original settlers of the Enst river valley, is a twisting crystalline structure, almost tree-like in form, perched on a rise above the Enst. For as long as anyone can remember, it has been said that, when the light of sunrise is reflected in its twists and turns, the crystals sing, in a language no one knows, but the song sings of hope, of comfort. those who make the pilgrimage in the night, and reach the crystals as the sun rises, say that they hear in the song the answers to doubts that have haunted them. 

Before the Drankorians came, the songs were thought to be Kestavan songs, and the Fell Burn was a sacred place. 

To the Drankorians, it was many things, and strange rumors spread. The most persistant was that, according to the Drankorian mages, it was a fragment of the moment of creation, frozen in time. The Drankorians built a fortification, and soon after a library, and it became a frequent site of travel and study, and the town of Fellburn grew. Many forgot the original meaning of Fellburn, and it acquired many names: the Singing Tree, in the colloquial, the Crystal of Time, among the wizards, and simply the Oracle of Hope to most. 

After the Fall of Drankor, Fellburn persisted - in these days, much seemed dark, and many sought the hope and comfort of the Oracle. Some in these days thought it was a miracle of the Wyrdling, or perhaps the Sibyl, but the priests never claimed a divine presence. 

As Sembara grew, Fellburn came to prosper. It was never the greatest economic powerhouse of the Enst, for the river was too wide here for a crossing, even in Drankorian days (or, the hills on either side too steep), and with no easy harbors it did not lend itself to a riverboat port. 

But, the pilgrims always came, and with them coin, and so the city grew.

(picture is tentative)


[3/27/2024 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
I like that. Interestingly this is very close to the line of sunset in the fey wild.


[3/27/2024 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I was trying to make it very much not fey flavored - kind of thinking this is more of a mystery that shouldn't fit any obvious categories


[3/27/2024 6:31 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah it didn‚Äôt read as fey flavored - but it is kinda similar to the Sunset Gate thing I made up in a way


[3/27/2024 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay


[3/27/2024 6:32 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe change the association with sunrise


[3/27/2024 6:32 PM] rsulfuratus
my thinking is also that this is basically indestructive

[3/27/2024 6:32 PM] .deciusmus
Pilgrims sometimes wait days for it to sing


[3/27/2024 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
Sometimes it sings every hour. Sometimes it is a week


[3/27/2024 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I was going for the "hike up mt fuji at night to see the sunrise" vibe but yeah could be just sings when it sings, that might be better


[3/27/2024 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
I think the sunrise connection is going to make it seem fey once my players go to the sunset gate


[3/27/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
right. i actually like the unpredictability more


[3/27/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so I was thinking it is indestructable and couldn't be sacked by the hobgoblins, and also ancient and pre-dates sembara, so probably Fellburn does get sacked, but is seen as a very significant loss out of proportion to its military significance (hobgoblins captured Oracle of Hope) so there is a lot of motivation to recaputre Fellburn


[3/27/2024 6:36 PM] .deciusmus
Right that works. The town is sacked but not occupied


[3/27/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Or only occupied briefly.


[3/27/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have a some idea of what this really is or just random coolness?


[3/27/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
my best guess is the Drankorian wizards are correct, and it is a frozen piece of the Riving, but not committed to that


[3/27/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
my second guess is it could eventually tie into whatever the moon is


[3/27/2024 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
(depending on whether you want it to be significant for your campaign / Igzil)


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm. I will ponder. I like the idea of this a lot though.


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
Are you envisioning it at the center of town? Or outside the town more in a separate space ?


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] rsulfuratus
no, outside town


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] rsulfuratus
not far outside town, like <1 mile


[3/27/2024 6:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm thinking this part of the Enst is fairly hilly and so this stands on a rise of land above the river, and the town itself is in the valley


[3/27/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
Right that works


[3/27/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
How big are you envisioning it? Like 10 people at a time walking through it? 50?


[3/27/2024 6:45 PM] rsulfuratus
closer to 10 than 50. maybe a dozen?


[3/27/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
presumably there would be some kind of organizations associated with it, a guild or pilgrim's fund or something, that helps keep things organized


[3/27/2024 6:46 PM] .deciusmus
Also how do you feel about undead seeming to be terrified or repealed by it? I have no specific reason but I am sure this will come up soon in my game because the party wants to go see what‚Äôs going on with the siege of fellburn right after rinburg


[3/27/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
that would make perfect sense


[3/27/2024 6:47 PM] rsulfuratus
it is small enough it isn't really an effective shelter, but yes undead should avoid it


[3/27/2024 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
(In theory the session you would be npcing at would be part lake monster part roleplaying in fellburn‚Äî so having the cleric have some connection to fellburn is perfect he‚Äôd accompany the party onward and then stay in fellburn)

basic outline of Armand backstory:
- mother was from Fellburn, fled the sack (probably around 11-12) but was separated from her family, ended up in Embry, found her way onto a ship and became a sailor
- father from local middle class Embry family, maybe a scribe or something
- grew up with mostly absent mother, but always eager to hear stories of the sea, and her stories of Fellburn
- as soon as he was old enough, left home to become a sailor, and traveled on merchant ships around the Green Sea
- was a sailor for several decades, into his 40s or so
- maybe 6-7 years ago, something happened; not sure exactly what yet, but something to do with undead that (a) triggered / opened his mind to latent divine magic and (b) left him deeply concerned with protecting the world from the wandering dead
- returned to Embry and became an acolyte at temple of Night Queen, practicing magic and learning about undead


[3/27/2024 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
I like the basic outline. There is a bit of a vibe I have going with various night queen associated people having a sense of unease before the undead uprising. Perhaps that sense of unease made him leave Embry and go to the Oracle of Hope, So he was in the Enst river valley for Pyravella.


[3/27/2024 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe in Rinburg (or Fellburn).


[3/27/2024 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure how he joined up with Vahaiya and their crew though. It feels like if he was in either Rinburg or Fellburn at the time he would have gotten caught in in those events and wouldn‚Äôt be in Champimont now


[3/27/2024 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe he was in Rinburg when the first wave of undead rose, but at the time no one knew about the lake monster, so he immediately set out on the road to see how he could help. After all in many places it was just one or two zombies, which he‚Äôd usually be able to defeat himself.


[3/27/2024 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
He got caught up in the area around Eftly, where a big ghast-like creature devoured the town and literally met Vahaiya and their crew when they came to kill it


[3/28/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm. I have an NPC (Eremon) who is a (non-magical) acolyte of the Night Queen, from Fellburn, who left Fellburn ~6/7 years ago and was wandering around, and has been recently having premonitions about the undead rising.

I wonder if something happened around when Cece died that foreshadowed the lich in some way.

I kinda like the idea that the lich is ultimately in conflict with the Night Queen, and goes after her elders because they are closing in on him.


[3/28/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
(I mean, he isn't *intentionally* in conflict with her, but he is very anti-theNightQueen, he is basically trying to subvert the natural order of death and so on)


[3/28/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to get the villages correct, there isn't really a great map that I can find in Obsidian. Basically you have, west to east along the Great South Road:
Cleanseau -- 6 miles -- Beury -- 15 miles -- Dallet -- 10? miles -- Champimont -- 10? miles -- Eftly -- 20 miles -- Rinburg -- 95 miles -- Fellburn


[3/28/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
is that right?


[3/28/2024 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah basically.


[3/28/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
I have some better notes in my dm folder.


[3/28/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
Let me look in a min


[3/28/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
I should move this to proper notes...

Starting in Rinburg the usual walking route is:

Rinburg to Essenmer (long day on foot, 12 miles)
Essenmer to Eftly (short day, 9 miles)
Eftly to Champimont (very short day, 6 miles, but Champimont is the largest town between Rinburg and Cleenseau)
Champimont to Dallet (long day, 13 miles)
Dallet to Beury (long day, 15 miles)
Beury to Cleenseau ~5 miles


[3/28/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't made up anything past Rinburg toward Fellburn


[3/28/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
also, if I'm reading the timeline correctly, the attacks basically start all over around Jan 7/8. where is Vahiaya then? by Jan 15th they end up in Champimont, heading west from Eftly where a monster was defeated - but at this point Fellburn has been under siege for a week or so


[3/28/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Armand was with Vahiaya in Eftly, or met in Champimont?


[3/28/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
Unclear.


[3/28/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
or undetermined?


[3/28/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
have a meeting more in a bit


[3/28/2024 1:38 PM] .deciusmus
The undead awaken in 3 waves

* Jan 4th overnight - dead awaken across Sembara, mostly in places where there are large numbers of unburied dead
* Jan 5th overnight - second wave of dead awaken
* Jan 6th overnight - third wave of dead awaken

But in many cases not near civilization or in scattered places, and sometimes take a night or two to move from "awake" to "above ground"

So the basic timeline is in a variety of places across Sembara, problems with undead start as early as the morning of Jan 5th or as late as the evening of Jan 8th


[3/28/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
The Fellburn siege begins in the predawn hours of Jan 8th


[3/28/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
Eftly is attacked on Jan 7th, although the monster grows and becomes big only the 10th-11th (although this isn't canonical)


[3/28/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
I don't have a canonical route for Vahaiya and the Rangers, but the basic idea is:

The 5th or 6th  they get magical communication (sending/speaking stones/etc) of the start of problems, as various groups within Sembara basically start asking the Rangers for help.

Vahaiya is in Addermarch or the border baronies north of the Mostreve Hills and this point, and is one of several groups the Rangers send north. 

Takes 3-5 days to get from wherever to the Enst (near Rinburg, I guess). But some encounters or problems could have delayed this a bit. 

I haven't entirely figured out why the Rangers didn't stay in Rinburg to try to help with the lake monster. Either they never passed through Rinburg (so didn't know about it, i.e. if they came over the Enst on the west side of Eftly and/or in between Eftly and Rinburg) or they felt someone else was doing it and agreed to split up.


[3/28/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess where I'm going with this is my feeling is Armand would probably not head west away from Fellburn, upon hearing news of big undead siege there, unless he is explicitly going to get help for Fellburn, or he can't get to Fellburn because of dangers on the road or something like that


[3/28/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but not sure enough about the timeline of what is happening where to propose a coherent "last two weeks" itinerary for him


[3/28/2024 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
I suspect the best story for him is that he is actually trying to get to Fellburn


[3/28/2024 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
He was - for whatever reason - west of Eftly when the undead starting rising. He might not have even heard about the siege of Fellburn at first, as the ghast-creature in Eftly was cutting off most news from the east


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
why did Vaihaya turn west from Eftly instead of east towards Rinburg?


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
So they'd run into my PCs? Duh üòÑ


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
well obviously


[3/28/2024 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
Realistically, I suspect Vahaiya was basing themselves in Champimont. So it is a return-to-base and regroup


[3/28/2024 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
It's only 6 miles to Eftly, so reasonable to defeat the monster, return to Champimont for a long rest/restock, then head out


[3/28/2024 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
what is happening on the Wistel? are there undead there too or confined to the south?


[3/28/2024 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
Here's the full set of outbreaks:

The major clusters are:
* Fellburn skeletal army, emerges Jan 6th - 7th overnight, crawls and forms and reforms, some people flee and die Battle of Stavenford / Battle of Fellburn, (largest mass of undead)
* Eskbridge Far east near Tyrwingha 4th - 5th is (big)
* Borderlands all 3, 5 clusters total, mostly small, local devastation and local heroics (maybe doesn't happen)
* Rinburg 6th - 7th emerges in lake (giant eel thing only, minimal actual undead)
* Aveil hills, emerges 4th - 5th (small)
* Ainwick emerges 5th - 6th bandit zombies (big))
* Cleenseau 4th - 5th second one 7th (small)
* Dunmore 4th - 5th (small)
* Enford 6th - 7th (small)
* Gowerborne Wis 2 - 5th - 6th, (big)

Although not 100% of those are canonical


[3/28/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
It is isolated to south of the Wistel for the most part; the only case I have of an outbreak beyond the Wistel is in the Aine Hills


[3/28/2024 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing near Embry, or really outside the Dunfry - Aveil - Wisford section other than the one outbreak in the Aine Hills


[3/28/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
The ones that I'm sure about are

Gowerbourne, on the Wistel, but the outbreak is actually inland. This is where the Duke of WIsford is now (although he is heading to Fellburn)

Fellburn.

Aveil Hills (but this is small)

Aine Hills (this is distracting the Army of the West)

Enford (small)


[3/28/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
(plus the stuff in Rinburg and Cleenseau, although none of that is very big)


[3/28/2024 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
I'm leaning toward the Borderlands one being not real (I didn't even hint at it in game) and the Eskbridge one being just false rumors


[3/28/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
(I'm in a meeting, responses might be slow)


[3/28/2024 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
So here is roughly what I would propose for Armand. Timing not precise and needs checking with travel times. 

Early Dec sometime (5-6 weeks ago, per your comment in Armand's obisidan note), he left Embry based on bad premonitions about undead and such. Reaches Wisford and then heads upriver, towards Gowerbourne and eventually aiming for Ainwick. This could be (a) on orders of the temple in Embry, if there is an organized effort to send people investigating premonitions; (b) because he knows someone he wants to connect with, someone with Night Queen connections he feels might have insight; (c) perhaps because of dreams / visions. Probably (b) is cleanest but I don't know the relevant context.

It is ~250 miles from Wisford to Ainwick, so say is not pushing hard and gets there in ~2 weeks, mid/late December. Spends Pyravela in Ainwick. 

It is only 50-60 miles from Ainwick to the Aveil Hills, so when rumors reach him in Ainwick (maybe Jan 6-7) of undead, he heads south, hurrying, reaching Aveil Hills perhaps in 2 days, by Jan 8-9.  (*note this requires delaying the emergence of Ainwick undead so he has left by the time they emerge, or deciding this didn't happen)

In Aslain, rumors are flying about all kinds of badness, mostly to the south, so he heads south. At this point, probably trying to get to Fellburn and help there, but hears of the lake monster in Rinburg and does not think he can face it alone, so swings west to gather news and hopefully allies. 

At that point, either meets Vahaiya and their crew in Eftly and helps with the monster there, or ends up in Champimont looking for news and allies heading east.


[3/28/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
Fleshing out a bit more, I would say it probably makes the most sense if:
(a) Armand left mostly on his own, not sent on a mission, largely just feeling restless and sure something bad was coming, and was aiming for Ainwick or some place near there, where he knew someone, an old friend, perhaps not a human - I am imagining basically a kind of recluse / hermit but who Armand would trust to have a sense of the land, corruption. probably not someone dedicated to the Night Queen, more like a druid-type, or a centaur, or maybe a halfling
(b) There was not an undead attack on Ainwick, so that Armand isn't tempted to turn back; there could have been outbreaks downriver between Ainwick and Gowerborne, or rumors could be confused


[3/28/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think it works better if he is local to Aveil in the Jan 5-8th timeframe. What if instead of going up the Wistel, he ends up in Aveil. Same idea (seeking a recluse/hermit type) but this person lives in the eastern eaves of the Cleenseau Wood, a bit upriver from Aslain say


[3/28/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
For him, the undead outbreak starts with a few zombies arising in the village next door, or whatever, and for ~3-4 days he is busy in the local area around  just helping folks.

Around Jan 10th he hears of 
(a) some trouble in the Aveil Hills

And he dithers for a bit but ultimately is compelled to head towards Fellburn. He heads south along the Auberonne

But before he reaches Rinburng, he gets pulled along a series of villages with problems and ends up finding it faster to get back on track by heading due south from some village west of the Auberonne, which puts him smack into Eftly.

He basically runs into Vahayia and their group hunting the ghast just outside Eftly

there seems to be a bug in the python site export code...
 A line like this: 
| ![[assets/ring-of-wounding.png\|240]]           | [[Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Treasure/Ring of Wounding.md\|Ring of Wounding]]                         | ring  | [Reference](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8244293-ring-of-wounding)             |

becomes

| ![Ring Of Wounding](../../../assets/ring-of-wounding.png/){width="240"}           | [Ring of Wounding](<../../Cleenseau Campaign/Treasure/Ring of Wounding.md/>)                         | ring  | [Reference](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8244293-ring-of-wounding)             |

i.e. the image and external links are fixed correctly but the internal link doesn't get slugifying (although it does not formatted)


[3/29/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
figured it out


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
although I don't know the fix


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
the issue is:

[[Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Treasure/Ring of Wounding.md|Ring of Wounding]]


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
that type of link (to the full filename) doesn't work


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
but that is what dataview generates for the "link" function


[3/29/2024 4:56 PM] rsulfuratus
this is a weird one


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
I think I have a fix


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i tentatively suspect windows/mac confusion


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
the issue is the ".md"


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
you have a block in export_vault


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
with the comment
 ## check to see if we have a broken obsidian path
                 # this is not the best way to do this


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that is what I'm looking at - that is where this should hit


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
the link ends with .md\


[3/29/2024 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
so the parts has as last part

Silverthorwn.md\ for example


[3/29/2024 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
but that isn't in self.path_dict, because the actual file ended up in as Silverthorwn


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
no .md


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
do you mean it ends .md, or .md\?


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
sorrry or .md\\?


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
I believe the 2nd one


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
where does the extra `\` come from?


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
here is the parts:

[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus

[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
it is because it is in a dataview table

[3/29/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
the actual line is:

[3/29/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus

```


[3/29/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
what fixed it for me was:

```-                if parts[-1] in self.path_dict:
-                    alias = str(parts[-1]) if alias == "" else alias
+                final_part = self.remove_trailing_backslash(parts[-1])
+                if final_part.endswith(".md"):
+                    final_part = os.path.splitext(final_part)[0]
```


[3/29/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
and then using final_part instead of parts[-1] in the rest of the block


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
wait where does self.remove_trailing_backslash come from? did you add that too?


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
it comes from chatgpt

[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
rstrip does that

I don't see rstrip in the code though

[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
ah, sure


[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
your code might be better than chat gpt's


[3/29/2024 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
I just asked it how to remove a trailing "\\"


[3/29/2024 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
chat gpt didn't know about rstrip


[3/29/2024 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
what I'm slightly confused by is as I understand it the order shouldn't matter, replace then rstrip or rstrip then replace


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
I don't know what you are looking at


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
so there might be something else wrong with my code

`clean_name = parts[-1].replace('.md', '').rstrip("\\/")`

[4/1/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Kiya (Celyn's player) asked why Sembarans are distrustful of magic, anyhing you'd add / change about the below (haven't sent it yet):

There is no one event or specific reason why wizards are distrusted in Sembara, but there is a long cultural tradition dating back hundreds of years that is suspicious of "learned magic" and in particular magic as something you study and unpack how it works and then use that knowledge to make more of it. Where exactly it developed none of you would know, but since the Great War, a number of events have occurred that enforce and seem to confirm the suspicion. The most notable was the story of Elaine I and her twin sister Anne, which is long and tragic and something I will write up in more detail sometime - but in is briefest form there was a contest for the throne between Elaine and Anne, and in the course of that contest Anne studied magic deeply so she could learn to cast a powerful geas to force Elaine to give up the throne. This ended up failing (was found out, and undone) but it was seen as a confirmation of the worst things about wizards. The year after Anne's treachery was the Cursed Cold, when for five months fire radiated cold, not heat, and the days grew colder, not warmer, as the sun rose. This devastated the areas it impacted (cooking and growing crops are both hard without heat) and was seen by many as somehow related to Anne's treachery and a cost the entire kingdom bore for her magic.¬†

(There is also the story of how Drankor¬†fell, 700-ish years ago - a red mist that spread throughout the land killing millions - supposedly caused by the mages of Drankor, somehow - Drankor was obsessed¬†as a civilization with understanding magic, or so it is said).


[4/1/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
More broadly, there are other similar cultural stories that share the message: magic is something to worship, or be in awe of, or philosophize about, marvel at, accept as a gift, etc but studying how it works, unpicking the central mystery is seen as dangerous (choosing to mess around with forces you can't ever really understand), potentially nefarious (too many stories of research or other deep delving into the secrets of magic leading to corruption and evil, i.e. no one thinks Anne in the story above started out¬†bad), and in some cases, a little bit sacreligious (magic is a gift of the Sibyl, trying to learn magic is like trying to force your way into her good graces - that said, in Tollen the Sibyl is the patron of the university of magic, so this isn't a universal interpretation of her).

It wouldn't be right to oversell the prejudice either. Wizards are not hunted on sight, or anything like that. But many emigrate, i.e. to Tollen or Chardon, where magic is more accepted, and there are not many teachers, etc so they end up being rarer than other types of magic users. Interestingly, a wild magic sorcerer doesn't encounter the same prejudice, even though they may literally be dangerous to those around them - to a Sembaran, they were born with their magic, and so it isn't them choosing to be dangerous by delving into deep secrets.¬†
These are broadly Tyrwinghan beliefs as well, although in Tyrwingha there would be the added wrinkle of the fey. Famously, Ethlenn wanted to learn Drankorian magical secrets, and that plays into this idea that exploring the deep secrets of how magic works is too dangerous for mortals, and is best left to the fey.


[4/1/2024 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is basically right. One minor detail I would change is that the University in Tollen is not really a "magic university", and indeed the study of magic is a pretty minor part of the scholarship and learning at the university. Tollen is a lot more open and accepting of magic that Sembara, but there is a pretty strong contrast between e.g. Chardon and Tollen in terms of just how much organized magic you see walking around.


[4/1/2024 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also add that it isn't so much that wizards are hunted on sight or anything (they aren't), but that scholarly organizations and secret societies dedicated to the study of magic just never really get established in Sembara and are fairly strongly discouraged. So a lone wizard in their tower taking an appentice might be seen as a bit dangerous, a bit eccentic, but not someone you'd drive out of town; while something like the Society of the Open Scroll would be at a minimum forced underground if not outright driven out


[4/1/2024 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Finally I think the Tyrwinghan belief that probing the deep secrets of arcane magic is too dangerous for mortals and best left to the fey is a fairly common feeling across Sembara, probably spreading from Tyrwingha to some extent


[4/1/2024 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that all makes sense. This is in the context of an NPC they met, a wizard in Rinburg, who led, and is being blamed for the failure of, the first attempt to kill the lake monster


[4/1/2024 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
So the vibe has beeen a bit of prejudice and quickness to judge, i.e. it is clearly her fault. But also not like people are trying to drive her out of time or anything (and clearly she was powerful/important enough that she was in a position to help led the previous assault)


[4/1/2024 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think part of the vibe is that arcane magic is quite dangerous and quick to go wrong, which seems like it fits well. This probably develops even more strongly after all the fallout of the weird magic during the blood years in sembara and then the whole Elaine and Anne thing


[4/1/2024 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
do you think random PCs would know who the 3 despairs are?


[4/1/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I‚Äôm not sure. Originally I have kind of thought of that as elven lore but also not sure what is gained by keeping them secret?


[4/1/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
(I am writing another play-by-email scene) and this wizard, who is obsessed with transformation, definitely knows of them, and is going to mention one of her nightmares is the werewolves of the Mad One (i.e forced transformation). Just trying to decide how much to meta-explain vs wait for them to ask about.

I think in general I'm going to wait for them to ask I think it is kinda reasonable that any relatively learned person might have read of them (i.e. say Armand) but a 23 year old Tyrwinghan farmboy probably not


[4/1/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think that makes sense. There would be rumors and lore that is accessible in world to generally learned knowledgable people but they are not default knowledge


[4/2/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
So I introduced this divine soul sorcerer of the Sibyl, who is fascinated by magic and has kicked off a conversation with my PCs about the philosophy of magic (in a play-by-email exchange we are going to do over the next 2ish weeks). 

Do you have any interest in being part of it, either as Tristan (the sorcerer) or Armand? 

There is nothing ‚Äúgame/plot‚Äù related it‚Äôs just going to be people asking Tristan what he knows about different kinds of magic

Btw, all I have on Tristan is in obsidian. He has some mysterys (i.e. this He grew up in Tyrwingha, in Tafolwern, he says, but in the course of your talking about home, he talks about one of his earliest memories, the birth of Cece I's youngest daughter - which happened 57 years ago).

I was vaguely thinking he spent some time in the feywild, but any explanation you come up with for that, if it comes up, would be fine

what do you think of an eight-pointed seedling as a holy symbol of the mother? something kind of like: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1225080386766508075/1225083334397267998/rsulfuratus_Design_a_straightforward_and_iconic_symbol_for_a_fa_c42bfe41-365d-4031-8c22-17c2dd330294.png?ex=661fd6c3&is=660d61c3&hm=4298323e1fd2ebcbb21b45f9a333a632ef5ade66bf9e4679adebc47b57693e8f&

yeah, okay, going to keep that, was just messing around with a few other variants


[4/4/2024 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the context by which Tristan and your players ended up sitting down in an inn together?


[4/4/2024 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
meant to ask earlier


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
So Tristan and Vahayia and bunch of other rangers just killed a ghast in Eftly


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
The PCs were also heading toward Eftly to fight the ghast


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
(Note -
Ghast was giant growing thing much worse than regular ghast)


[4/4/2024 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
PCs showed up in Champimont (the biggest town between Rinburg and Cleenseau, but still small) when a big party was going on, basically a celebration/outpouring of relief because the rangers had killed the ghast


[4/4/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
The PCs and rangers all ended up in the same inn, and met, and spent some time talking and planning together. About who goes where next to deal with various remaining undead bits


[4/4/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
This scene is after the planning part, when half the rangers have gone to bed and the remaining are staying up talking


[4/4/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
They are in a private back room and the three magically interested PCs and Tristan end up talking


[4/4/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so Tristan has heard the PCs talk about magic and what they can do, but not actually seen them fight?


[4/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Right. He saw Viepuck cast a good berry spell and disguise self but both were odd - Viepucks patron is some kind of Far Realm alien mind and the disguise self is psionic-vibey


[4/4/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
(Game mechanically it is written as a projection so it only works on sentient creatures but in world reason for this is not clear)


[4/4/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
But otherwise just stories, although the players told their story about fighting undead so he‚Äôd know about their types of magic.

cleaning up some status tags and ran into an issue. Bas Udda was burned down by gnolls in April 1748, but resettled in Nov 1748. having a created date later than destroyed date breaks things.

I think best option here is just to use campaign info for this, instead of created/destroyed, but curious what you think


[4/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
I think having a block in the body of the text like

%%^Date:1748%%
In April of 1748... and in Nov of 1748
%%^End%%

And then not set the created destroyed (or set the created to the "original foundation")


[4/5/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
If you want lines to appear in the header, campaign info I guess is fine but I've become less of a fan of a lot of header lines


[4/5/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess Bas Udda is a bit of a weird case since the destruction and resettlement are both in the past. 

the general case though is that if taelgarverse in its current form had existed in 3 years ago or whenever, I'd want the page to be "Burned by gnolls on XX date"


[4/5/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe trying to put it all in the header is not that useful


[4/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
but I think I'd not overly worry about the non-existent game that is taking place in May 1748


[4/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
like, if Taelgarverse had existing back then, you could have changed the page to be "burned by gnolls" and then updated it when it was resettled to no longer say "burned by gnolls" and have text instead


[4/5/2024 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right. I guess that is the general solution, if a place is resettled just delete the destroyed date from the header and move to text


[4/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
right


[4/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
that doesn't work though if the resettlement is in the future compared to an active game


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
I think at some level worrying about the abstraction of "taelgarverse has to be able to reflect exactly what is happening on a specific random date" is too much trouble


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, like if Rinburg were destroyed by zombies in your game


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
Well I have a live example, Eftly, the little town that was destroyed by undead


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
But realistically, no one cares or has even decided if it gets resettled


[4/5/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
so it doesn't matter that on your taelgarverse it shows upa s "destroyed by a ghast creature, 1720"


[4/5/2024 4:47 PM] .deciusmus
But if in a year we are hunting clues about the Isingue acid monster and you want to reuse a bunch of the Enst valley stuff rather than setting the clue hunting somewhere else, it could in theory be a problem


[4/5/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point I actually looked a bit at basically abstracting the whereabouts logic to essentially every header piece of information


[4/5/2024 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
In theory I don't think it would be that hard to either introduce the idea ofa "Second life", i.e. say a page can have
created/destroyed/born/died
recreated/redestroyed/reborn/reallykilled


[4/5/2024 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
that could also work for undead, as an aside


[4/5/2024 4:49 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think the most robust way to do it would be to abstract whereabouts logic to page existence


[4/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
or, alternatively, allow created to be after destroyed, and handle that as a special case (i.e. it isn't really destroyed for age/existance stuff, but you show the destroyed line)


[4/5/2024 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
or alternatively try to do something generic but I 'm not sure how whereabouts logic abstracts, actually


[4/5/2024 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
because there is no "location"


[4/5/2024 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
location is just a binary. exists/doesn't


[4/5/2024 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
or, rather, exists or unknown, with unknown meaning dead


[4/5/2024 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
so a person born in 1650, killed in 1700, resurrected in 1744 would be someting like:
- home, 1650
- away, 1700
- home, 1774


[4/5/2024 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
current whereabouts logic would set location to "home" for 1650-1700, unknown for 1700-1744, and home from 1744-current


[4/5/2024 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
home = alive, unknown = dead


[4/5/2024 4:53 PM] rsulfuratus
would want to abstract it a bit so that we don't use home/away keywords and don't have a location and such


[4/5/2024 4:54 PM] rsulfuratus
but I'm pretty sure it would work=


[4/5/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
right, I see what you mean


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
something like
existance:
- { type: exist, start: 1650, end: 1700 }
- { type: exist, start: 1744 }


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
you could then add "startStatus"  / "endStatus"


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah something like that


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
actually I don't thik you need type or the concept of away at


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
no, you wouldn't, i forgot about end:


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
use the same whereabouts logic but just for "home"


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
and "last known"


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
so basically you get the home and/or last know


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right, if you have a home, you are alive. if not, you died at last known date


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
(alive = exist)


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
if you have a home, you are "alive" with a start status of start and an age of end - start
if you don't have a home, you are "dead", with a start status of start, age of end, etc


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, what you said


[4/5/2024 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
would actually be a way to deal with mirror people, better than whereabouts if the age calculations excluded periods of being dead


[4/5/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking the age would always basically be from "current" start to end


[4/5/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
that works better for places, for example


[4/5/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. Eftly, founded 1689, destroyed 1720, refounded 1730, if you wanted to calc the age it would be since refounding, I think


[4/5/2024 5:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yes. but for people it is a bit weird. someone who was dead and resurrected 1 year ago is not 1 year old


[4/5/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
true


[4/5/2024 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
although for undead it might make sense to say something like

died in xxx at age y, arose as a vampire in z (10 years ago)


[4/5/2024 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[4/5/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
probably easiest to start with just calculating age of the most recent period of existence, and then if someone wanted to fiddle could add a parsing token to age that would indicate total age (sum all existence intervals) instead of last age. which might be a little tricky


[4/5/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
anwyay, not going to do anything about it now but worth keeping in mind


[4/5/2024 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
yup


[4/5/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus

Sketching out a ton of new places for next Dunmar session on Thursday. Mostly expecting you'll learn about it in game but want a second opinion on a bunch of names. 

(this is the northern part of the peninsula, extending northwest from the canal - divided into three provinces in the Chardonian Empire)

Portalia (province around the canal, originally derives from Drankorian for passage)
Nevium (north end of canal city)
Pergia (south end of canal city)
Artevus (another city in this province)

Cedrano (next province to northwest, name derives from the largest river, Kedron, which is an old Northros / Northerner name)
Castrella (provincial capital)
Ombraforte (village or town)

Tamaris (final province, name derives from name for the peninsula, the Tamaro Peninsula; see below for alternatives)
Roccena (roc-CHE-na, provincial capital)
Tenze (TEN-tseh, city/town)
Antissus (city/town)
Sarvia (city/town)
Silbana (river)

Alternative peninsula names:
Maravio (province is Maravium)
Raziano (province in Razianium)

Other city/town/village names:
Telumis
Serraventia
Canophris


[4/27/2024 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
I like the general vibe. Prefer Raziano to Tamaro slightly but really either seems good. Don‚Äôt love Maravio


[4/27/2024 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
The end of the session tomorrow might be the breaking of the siege of Fellburn, which in my head is highlighted by a couple of powerful npcs. Do you think say a 15th lvl cleric, a 13th level paladin, and two 11th level clerics is too much magical force for the Duke of Wisford to have brought together?


[4/27/2024 7:08 PM] rsulfuratus
IMO yes


[4/27/2024 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I haven't thought super carefully about it, but in general I've tended to not create NPCs who can cast higher than 5th level spells, unless they are supposed to be basically the most powerful people in a kingdom

I think it breaks worldbuilding a bit if there are non-PCs who have that much magic. Or I guess rather non-adventurers, counting both PCs and villians

Isn‚Äôt it implausible that there are no super high level clerics in sembara at all though?


[4/27/2024 7:15 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn‚Äôt sure about the number ‚Äî ie would say 3 of the 8 most powerful clerics in sembara really be at this battle. But it seems like there should be say 8-10 clerics of 10+ level, right? I guess maybe half that makes more sense


[4/27/2024 7:15 PM] rsulfuratus
based on this with a population of 25 million (which might be high for Sembara - France in 1500 was more like 15 million), there would be perhaps as many as 13 clerics of level 9+

a 15th level cleric would likely be the most powerful magic user in Sembara - so I guess the question is, would the most powerful magic user in Sembara be at the seige of Fellburn?


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point (in same spreadsheet) we had calculated about 12 milliion humans in Sembara. So that would imply something like 4 of the 6 most power magic users showing up at Fellburn


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
Right that‚Äôs too much


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
Probably should be 11th and 9th or something


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
More later


[4/27/2024 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
So I think I‚Äôd revise to have one 13th or so level powerful cleric and then a couple of 7th levels. Plus a 9th or 10th level paladin.


[4/27/2024 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
The 13th probably is one of the 3-4 most powerful casters in sembara (although the spreadsheet suggests about 15 level 9+ casters in sembara)


[4/27/2024 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems sensible


[4/27/2024 8:09 PM] .deciusmus

I got sucked into a rabbit hole about the Villa of Papyri (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_of_the_Papyri) and then reading about the transition from papyrus scrolls to parchment manuscripts and the massive impact that tastes in the 7th and 8th centuries had on what Greek and Roman literature survived into the middle ages and thus to the modern day. 

Which made me wonder about Taelgar's document tradition and its impact on what survives now. I haven't given it much thought, but for example do the elves have parchment or paper from the beginning? When do humans on Hkar develop parchment and books?

Partially just idle thoughts, but partially matters for e.g. set dressing for Drankor. Are there lots of ancient books lying around in Drankor carried over from Hkar, for example? Is catastrophes the main source of knowledge loss, or do you have the same kind of document decay as in the real world, or some combination? 

Just kind of curious meanderings, in case you have any thoughts.

Villa of the Papyri
The Villa of the Papyri (Italian: Villa dei Papiri, also known as Villa dei Pisoni and in early excavation records as the Villa Suburbana) was an ancient Roman villa in Herculaneum, in what is now Ercolano, southern Italy. It is named after its unique library of papyri scrolls, discovered in 1750. The Villa was considered to be one of the most l...

Idea for refactoring items, based on thinking about magic items in Taelgar.

1) Magic items are typically created based on using specific semi-magical objects to bind/capture extraplanar energy, typically much easier at an extraplanar weak point. In general, this means that to create a magic item, you generally need to know the formula, in some ways analgous to spells.

2) Magic items have the same power law as spellcasters, so most magic items are common, and very few are exceptionally strong. However, while all artifacts have some kind of story, that doesn't mean a common item can't have a story. 

Separately a mechanical level, there is a reason to make the world conform to some general D&D rules. Most non-legendary, non-artifact magic items in D&D sourcebooks shouldn't be unique mechanically Taelgar, and the lore of magic items should have it make sense that certain items tend to be easy to find.


[7/7/2024 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
From this I can think of a few things that are maybe worth thinking about.

1) Some items -- Drankorian Sending Stones; Skaer masterwork weapons; Lakan monastery extradimensional storage -- have "standard" D&D mechanics (mostly) but are in-world part of a specific workshop tradition. These feel interesting and useful to track


[7/7/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
So far in my game the basic pattern has been‚Ä¶ 

Most items are fairly similar to specific D&D items, but often not in the exact form..

Ie a ring that has the same game effect as a pearl of power (rather than a pearl)

Also, I‚Äôve usually made up some brief history even for ‚Äúcommon‚Äù magic items, and I haven‚Äôt shied away from simple made up items, i.e an amulet with three stones each of which heals


[7/7/2024 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
(You can see this in my Cleenseau treasure folder)


[7/7/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
2) Some items -- a pearl of power is a good example -- are well known formula that recur, but at least so far are not things that come from a "workshop tradition". But these are not explicitly unique items, and would in world be broadly considered "the same" from an arcane perspective


[7/7/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
3) Some items are truly unique. They are creations that you wouldn't expect to see again, and have some unique creation story. Some of these are powerful artifacts (Ring of Undying, e.g.), others might be less powerful but still unique (Delwath's shield, naragil)


[7/7/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
Note that one might reuse the mechanics of a unique item in some circumstances, but from an in world mechanical perspective it would be a different formula in some sense


[7/7/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
The lore thing I'm most interested in is the distinction between 1 and 2.

In an obsidian context, I would likely want to always have a page for (1) and (3). 
(a) a page for "Drankorian sending stones" but not pages for each representative, unless there was meaningful history to track
(b) a page for any item in category #3
(c) a page for any item in category #2 that had


[7/7/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
oops that was a bit garbled


[7/7/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea is you'd make pages for (1) and (3) always, but only for individual representatives of (1) or (2) if the story warranted it


[7/7/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but I'm not sure if this matches with your magic item creation workflow


[7/7/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôve had a tendency to assume that magic items are very hard to destroy and haven‚Äôt thought much about how they come to be


[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right your players haven't asked for custom magic powers on their flying castle yet I presume


[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
By that I mean I thought more about the history


[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
Ie a Drankorian shield that was unearthed or a Sembaran war hammer that was buried with a knight or whatever


[7/7/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Magic items have mostly had a specific ‚Äúancient‚Äù source in my game so far


[7/7/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
But I think the general ideas you outlined make sense, except I think I‚Äôve leaned into a little bit more creativity and likelihood for group #2


[7/7/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think in that context your magic items are much "cleaner" from an obisidian point of view. if each item has a clear history then it likely deserves its own page (if only for campaign notes type info) and how it was created doesn't necessarily matter.


[7/7/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but you guys have a lot of magic items without a clear history, or just vague notes about who created it (since by default that is the easiest thing to improvise in the mirror if I at least know where and when it was created)


[7/7/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Right. From a notes perspective your division makes sense


[7/7/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
for example I will probably make a page for the Urskan monster part trade but not make individual pages for everything you bought in the market in Zvervinka


[7/7/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Also it is probably useful to think about some common archetypes, other than bags of holding / sending stones / Skaer weapons

I think I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily assume the D&D rules are exactly the common formulas though. Ie I introduced an amulet with one-time healing abilities which was described as an embodied miracle of the Mother passed down as a family heirloom. I can imagine things like that being common-ish in Sembara


[7/7/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
right, it doesn't have to strictly connect to mechanics or D&D sourcebooks


[7/7/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
But actually thinking about those categories helps refine items. For example
Boots of false tracks are pretty common. Why? Could be fun to make up and then just make a page for the general item


[7/7/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[7/7/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
some could be just that weak effects are easy to create, but others could be a specific reason. e.g, the Dunmari army during the Dharajun Dynasty made a large number of horn of silent alarms and so they are commonly found around Dumar and typically date to the Great War and immediately pre-Great War era

doing a major rework of items. kind of into it. pushing as I go in case you are interested.

one question: I assume you don't really care if you can figure out what items I have backstory invented for. my plan is to significantly trim secrets, and generally make pages for anything that has a notable secret even if the item itself might not otherwise warrant a page.

it isn't quite done, but the magic item rework in obsidian is shaping to do the following:
1) make pages for everything that is either (a) a specific item, whether unique or not, with a story; or (b) a generic class of items, such as "Drankorian message stones" or "dragonhide armor"
2) move all secrets for the Dunmar campaign to individual item pages or to "hoard pages", which would be the summary of all the items from a particular adventure or arc
3) clean up party treasure to be easier to read and edit

one issue so far is that we currently don't have a clear way to distinguish between types of items and specific items. currently this is just by folder, with things/magic items being generic things that have many copies in the world (workshop items from previous discussion), and things/artifacts of power or dunmar frontier/treasure/notable items having unique things (whether actually unique or historically/lore unique).

not sure if there is a better way to do this


[7/11/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
there probably is but I don't have time to think about it this week

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/15/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
At the moment it‚Äôs mostly just moving stuff around. So far there are a couple of open questions:

1. Were the orcs created at the same time as the elder folk (as the main background history of Taelgar says) or were they created at the same time as humans and hobgoblins (as a mythic history brainstorming doc suggests)


[7/15/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
2. Should anything at all about the southerners (other than ‚Äúthey existed‚Äù be considered canonical?) I‚Äôd prefer to leave them out except as a ‚Äúthe southerners existed what happened to them tbd‚Äù


[7/15/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
3. Is there a firm date for the creation of humans?


[7/15/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
For (1), I don't think there is a canonical answer. I haven't spent much time on the history of the non-People of the Rainbow orcs. Either is plausible, and the metaphysics of how exactly the Void Mind and the Despairs etc work is not clear. There is a certain logic to having all the "elder folk/children of embodied divinities" appear at the same time, but I'm not sure there is a need to be fully committed to parallelism


[7/15/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I imagine this is not really known even among elven scholars -- even if the orcs were created early, they didn't really have a big impact until later -- so probably reasonable to leave it as unknown until more detail is needed. 

Certainly the people of the rainbow don't really maintain tales or myths from their chained days, and so for them their creation story is about the Cloudspinner


[7/15/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
For (2), per Milo's story, rumors of them surely exist in Chardon among other places. So it is more "they exist but no one really goes there because it is too hard so news is all garbled"


[7/15/2024 9:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I can just mention both possibilities with a ‚Äúwho knows what really happened‚Äù. Makes sense to me


[7/15/2024 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
For (3), I think there should be but I'm not quite sure what it should be. Something like 1500-1700 maybe?


[7/15/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
There are dates ranging for 1500-2400 in various docs


[7/15/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
I was leaning toward something like 1750-1850


[7/15/2024 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
1850 gives ~2200 years of human culture before the downfall which feels about right


[7/15/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
Be a little earlier might also make sense? 1550 = 2500 years


[7/15/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
the religious history of taelgar doc has I think the most canonical thinking about pre-Downfall humanity, through a religious lens

(as an aside, did we ever finalize Deno'qai funerary traditions?)


[7/15/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, for human history, I think that the "era of personal deities" feels like it could easily be 1000 years of relative stasis. not much arcane magic development, not much urbanization, pretty idyllic


[7/15/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
for dating, the only real information is that the philosopher's guild suggests the binding stones are more than 3000 years old

The only real thing we have is the  ‚Äútraditions around death‚Äù doc


[7/15/2024 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
the events in described the philosopher's letter probably take place in the early pantheonic days, or perhaps the small gods era, hard to say precisely. but that puts that kind of transitory period at or before say ~2800

Nothing canonical I think but I haven‚Äôt gotten that far and am not at my computer.


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so mariner migrations must be a few hundred years before that at least


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
probably more


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure we need to settle this tonight - i have more session prep to do anyway - but probably something like 1500-1700 is more correct for human origin than the later dates. 2400 is definitely too late, not enough history on Hkar before migrations IMO


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So let‚Äôs say 3500 or earlier. Probably first explorers 3300


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah agreed no need to settle right now


[7/15/2024 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
my vision of human history on Hkar is that it is largely driven by developments in magic. so when everyone has a personal deity things don't change much, everyone has a bit of magic that makes life pretty comfortable (although some people create curses and bring the nine hells into existence)


[7/15/2024 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
this continues for a long while, potentially. but once arcane magic comes you get the rapid development of the hkar urban culture, the split with the mariners, etc


[7/15/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
But as a strawman maybe something like:

- 1500 creation
- 2250-2500 northerners
- 2800-2900 earliest pantheons
- 3300 - mariners start
- 3400 - mariners peak
- 3500 - mariners end


[7/15/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
But with the northerners and pantheon dates perhaps moved a bit or a lot


[7/15/2024 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, something like that is fairly reasonble as a rough starting point to work out. mariners might shift a bit later depending on how long it takes them to found tollen (not sure it would take 500 years to settle the length of the green sea, that seems a bit excessive)


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. It depends on how long they spend mucking about in the magic islands having religious schisms


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
downfall is like 4100 or thereabouts


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[7/15/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus

[7/16/2024 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
the only one I might leave is the player map


[7/16/2024 1:44 PM] rsulfuratus
although I guess you could just test if the jpeg looks noticeably worse when zoomed to 300% or whatever


[7/16/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
any art can definitely be converted to jpg


[7/16/2024 1:46 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I wasn't going to touch the map; just AI art


[7/16/2024 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
I went with 1520 for the date of creation just to have something


[7/16/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
just playing around with this a bit, I think this timeline isn't quite right.  The idea is that there is explosive change in Hkar in the aftermath of the northerners leaving and encountering the Elder Folk, but 300-400 years for the development of the earliest pantheons seems too long


[7/16/2024 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
the only firm date we have is Sargon was defeated no later than ~2800. (So that the philosopher's "more than 3000 years ago" works). But no reason it couldn't have been 2500 or 2200 even, right?


[7/16/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, maybe the northerners left later? like 2600


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah any of those options works. Decision is about the balance of time in the various phases of hkaran history.  There are enough unknowns that it seems a bit hard to pin down


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
on the one hand, no reason to decide


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
on the other hand, some arbitrary decisions help sometimes


[7/16/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
at the moment, I am thinking something like:

~300 years of "personal deities" era. 
~700 years of "small gods" era

Northerner migration is the ending of the small god era

~200 years of rapid change

~1500 years of the pantheonic era


[7/16/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not really sure if that is right. It's hard to know how rapidly the pantheonic era should conslidate


[7/16/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
into Mos Numena


[7/16/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I think one consideration is that to a certain extent, this plays into the question of why the downfall happens. 

The original conception from high school was supposed to be kind of opposed to the Tolkien mythic history of "humans are punished for challenging the gods" type thing. So the Downfall doesn't happen because humans get greedy, it happens because of evil gods or the Void Mind or whatever tbd forces. It happens to humans, basically, more like a natural disaster. 

I think this, to a certain extent, argues for a relatively shorter pantheonic era. If the Void Mind is trying to stop humans, the Hkaran urban elite is developing high magic and cooperating with elves, why wait?


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I mean, I definitely like the vibe of the Downfall as a "from the outside" disaster


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
But the Void Mind might need to wait to gain strength


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, there are possible reasons why it could happen anytime, of course


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. grow the hobgoblin armies in secret or whatever


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
If the Sargon date is going to stay canonical there isn't really room to make the pantheonic era much shorter than 1500 years


[7/16/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Because I think it should definitely be true that the transition from small gods to pantheons is short


[7/16/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it makes a ton of sense for their to be a long period of "proto pantheons" that Sargon can fit into. Right?


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
well, what there is no information about is what the Chainshroud actually was. Sarqon could be a full-fledged god worshipped by a cult.


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
I guess Sargon could be a 'big small god'


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
The other constraint is that the northern migration needs time, once it happens, to spread across Taelgar and diversify


[7/16/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
So I think the northerners can't be too early


[7/16/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
* i mean too late


[7/16/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, my thought is that there is effectively one period of rapid change in Hkar: the evolution from small gods to big pantheonic gods.

And that this period of rapid change should be:
* Short (100 - 300 years, but probably closer to 100 than 300)
* Soon after the Northerners leave and the humans and Elder Folk start interacting


[7/16/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
So, rereading the religious history doc, I feel like the era of personal deities/cults and the early pantheonic stages could last for quite a long time. the small gods -> pantheons does need to happen quickly


[7/16/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
for example, I'm not sure why "In a variety of ways, the era of cults quickly becomes an era of small gods. It likely starts with ancestor worship - if your mother was a powerful divine sorcerer, and you benefitted from her personal deity in life, it would be very natural to continue praying to her personal deity in death." has to be true


[7/16/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, the era of cults is kind of undeveloped


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I'm not sure it matters when the transition from personal deities to cults is


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Similarly, the transition from "early pantheonic" to "proto-Mos-Numena" can be anytime


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
what does seem clear is that the small gods is an important but brief transitory period, and a lot of things happen:
- northern migrations
- contact with elder folk
- arrival of arcane magic in force


[7/16/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
The thing that impacts everything else is basically when does the small gods -> early pantheonic transition happen


[7/16/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure if the small gods period has to be brief. You could have a short cult phase and a long small god phase, for example


[7/16/2024 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
so there are actually some conflicted metaphysics about the outer planes and the religious history docs


[7/16/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., where do places like Arborea and the Nine Hells come from? they are supposed to be kind of inchoate belief from the early days but this conflicts a bit with the idea that it isn't until the early pantheonic days that people start imaging  extraplanar divinities


[7/16/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, that is neither here nor there for dating


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
in my mind, the northerner migration, contact with elder folk, spread of arcane magic, and the pantheonic tradition are all tied together and happen in a relatively short window


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. Strongly agree


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
say within about 200-500 years max


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/16/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
so how much history is about right for the northerners on the main continent?


[7/16/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
And of course this needs to be during the "small gods" era, but it could be that small gods only lasts 200-300 years and overlaps almost entirely with the "transition" period.

Or it could be that small gods lasts 1000 years and ends with the migrations


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
There needs to be enough time that Zimka/Vos are well established in Sembara when the mariners show up


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
I think that's the main constraint really


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't necessarily take the northerners that much time to get there


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
But the world isn't _that_ big. It could probably be as little as 800 years and as many as 1800


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
which says, say 2100 - 3100


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if Tollen is founded in 3902 that implies mariners make it to Western Gulf by say 3700 at the earliest? Tollen is supposed to be one of the first mariner cities in that part of the Green Sea


[7/16/2024 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
I was using the founding of Tollen as the function "point of contact" but probably 100 years before is better


[7/16/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
give the Zimka like 8-10 generations minimal in the highlands before then only pushes their arrival back to 3100ish? plus/minus a hundred years


[7/16/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
sorry wrong math, more like 3400


[7/16/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so assume very roughly 800-1000 years to migrate, you could have northerns make first contact with continent around 2400-2600


[7/16/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Although I think 1000 years is a very long time to migrate. There are all kinds of reasons they might have been moving faster


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right but doesn't mess anything up for them to have been in the region for 20-30 generations, or 100 generations


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
I'd stick with my the migration should probably not be before 2000 or after 3000 but anything else could work


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yes I think that is good


[7/18/2024 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
Did you push any notes on this yet?


[7/18/2024 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
in the history-rewrite branch


[7/18/2024 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
I didn't want to do it in main because I was doing a lot of deleting and moving wanted to be able to review a diff to make sure I deleteing the right stuff


[7/18/2024 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure if I got this exactly captured


[7/18/2024 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
I have a session in 1.5 weeks and am mostly switching my taelgar focused stuff to session prep for a bit


[7/18/2024 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus
I need to finally actually develop drankor ha ha so working on a lot of history over the next couple of weeks, fwiw


[7/18/2024 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
you should definitely look at my history-rewreite


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i am tempted to rewrite a little to move away from the Tolkien-esque "elder folk" "elder days" "ages of the world" framework


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
I was pretty tempted to get rid of the whole "5th age"


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that seems pointless. it was originally an idea for elven timekeeping before we came up with the ka cycle


[7/18/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
right, I guess with the ka cycle why would elves have some different "ages" concept? i mean, I guess you might refer to some set of ka by a name, but that would be very elvish


[7/18/2024 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
so really, you can imagine a mythic structure that is basically

"Time before time"
"Time before humans"
"History"


[7/18/2024 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
But it might be good to have a term to refer to the first two categories... whether that uses the word "Age" I'm not sure


[7/18/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
well, i guess the real idea is that from a metaphysical point of view, there is just the "Mythic Age" (before time) and "History". but that doesn't mean that scholars wouldn't make up names. So from a human point of view, you might have the Hkaran Era and the Drankorian Era


[7/18/2024 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
and humans might actually consider the Mythic Age to be everything pre-existence of humans


[7/18/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I was thinking from the perspective of a Drankorian scholar you'd have

the time before time
the time before humans
the Hkaran Era
the current time

from the perspective of a Chardonian scholar, you'd add

the time before time
the time before humans
the Hkaran Era
the Drankorian Era
the current time

but actually the real dividing point is probably the fall of Drankor, not the fall of Cha'mutte


[7/18/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
from a "making stuff up" point of view, the difference between the time before humans the Hkaran Era is small


[7/18/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. in many ways the world building history is easier if we don't think of the creation of humans as some "New Age!!!" but just an event


[7/18/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
that avoids eg feeling like the timing of orcs or hobgoblins has to be related to some "age transition"


[7/18/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think from a worldbuilding perspective there are really three substantial eras:
- before the planes are separated by the Riving
- between the Riving and the Downfall
- between the Downfall and the current day


[7/18/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
right


[7/18/2024 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that the Age of Myth, the Age of Creation, and the Age of Humanity are reasonable worldbuilding internal names but each could conceivably have different names in different cultures as well, tbd. to the extent to which we want to invest in that kind of worldbuilding.


[7/18/2024 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
right. that probably makes sense too, and is a slightly different dividing line (i.e. presuming the Age of Creation ends with the creation of Humans)


[7/18/2024 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
or you could imagine the Age of Humanity divided into the Hkaran Era, the Drankorian Era, and the post-Drankorian Era


[7/18/2024 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
again, from a worldbuilding-internal naming standpoint mostly


[7/18/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
one idea I had that i'm not sure about is that the downfall is actually the end of the age of creation, and rather than having a bunch of "void mind" races lingering in the shadows and growing in strength for a thousand years, you basically have wars break out kind of suddenly, and really have for the first time in history (since the riving) the concept of large scale war.


[7/18/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
the downfall is basically the last gasp of the void mind to destroy the work of the age of creation


[7/18/2024 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
and something about the downfall is actually significantly more mythically/metaphysically real, it locks into a place a bunch of metaphysics and further restricts magic in some way. maybe moving the outer planes even further from the material plane or something.


[7/18/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea of downfall being metaphysically significant... but I also like the elves having this long period of wariness and empire building... and the current semi-canon for the dwarven split is those who want to fortify the underground vs those who want to flee the underground


[7/18/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
So there could be advantages to having a long slow buildup


[7/18/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
If gnomes only left in the 200 years before the downfall or something they should be more well known across taelgar, right?


[7/18/2024 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess my thought is those kinds of premonitions are more interesting if it is really a magical thing: elmerica is warning the elves of something new, all consuming war, that the that world has never seen; maybe before this time the Warrior of the Bahrazel is something else, not the Warrior, and it is during this time a cult of the Warrior grows up among the dwarves, some thinking this is dangerous and terrible and others believing their crazy stories


[7/18/2024 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus
the dangerous and terrible folks lose and leave, and dwarven society starts inventing armies


[7/18/2024 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I don't disagree, but it seems odd to have the premonitions 1000 years before anything bad happens


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
Even elves aren't going to plan for 1000 years in the future


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
no, but the firstborn don't know when exactly something bad is going to happen


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
its like e.g. early christian predictions about the end of the world or something


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
right, I mean, if the premonitions start in 2000 and the wars don't erupt until 3800 that's a long time to be having faith in the premonitions


[7/18/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
It has a very different flavor than the premonitions start in 2000 and are proven true in 2150 or 2200


[7/18/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
in, actually, a not dissimilar way to christian evolution of the end of the world as being seen as less and less "mainstream" as it kept not happening


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
doesn't mean that can't be what happened, I just think it changes the flavor in a way I'm not sure I love


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, yes, this is part of why the downfall is so bad. if all of elven society believed that war was going to break out in 100 years they'd have been better prepared and all their empires wouldn't have been lost


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
thats a good point


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
the circle I'm trying to square is basically how badly the non-humans lose


[7/18/2024 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
i mean obviously on some level they win but at massive cost. so why weren't they more prepared?


[7/18/2024 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
What if you have something like...
(a) Both the dwarven and elven firstborn have these major premonitions of disaster, but like, in 2000 or even 1500. A long time before the downfall wars
(b) At first, both societies largely accept them, and start preparing for war
(c) After a hundred years of nothing happening, starts to be schisms. Gnomes split. Disagreement amongst the elves
(d) Say after another hundred years, small cracks that let in creatures from the Far Realms into the deeps start to appear
(e) this is nothing "earth shattering" and doesn't really impact elves at all, but it is enough to entrench the dwarven warrior thruh and it becomes this kinda smallish group who defends the deep from the occasional aberration


[7/18/2024 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
Then 1000+ years pass, and the elves who accept the possibility of danger have become something like a small cult of sorts, the watchers or whatever


[7/18/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
Probably needs a bit of work, but I feel like the "isolated watchers not quite believed" works better for elves than dwarves


[7/18/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
Not sure what stoneborn/halflings/lizardfolk are doing all this time


[7/18/2024 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
yes. in my sentient ocean history, canonically the riving is supposed to open cracks to the far realms, and while it would in theory take some time for e.g. mind flayers to show up those make sense as the "first enemies"


[7/18/2024 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus
I like this. you also have things like undead, and maybe lycanthropy, and a few other evils. greedy dragons and the like, and maybe some remnant giant populations who see small folk as lesser. so it isn't like the world is missing conflict. but you really don't have "war", except deep in the underdark where dwarves fight mind flayers and other strange aberrations


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
there is just enough danger so that the watcher elves or whatever aren't completely unbelievable, but the idea that a few undead or a greedy dragon would spawn vast armies seems difficult to believe


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
And in particular, nothing like the "First Age of Elves on Middle Earth in the long fortified war against Morgoth" vibe


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
I like that


[7/18/2024 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
One thought. Does the Void Mind lose because of the efforts of the firstborn races, or is it something else?

Is the Void Mind winning until somehow a trap is set on Hkar, and massive armies of hobgoblins and orcs and whatever else all sail to Hkar and then the place is sunk to destroy the armies?

Or is the "mainland" battles more even, or at least not quite so hopeless?


[7/18/2024 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
What if there is something specific about Hkar that empowers the divine spark


[7/18/2024 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
I've always kind of imaged the destruction of Hkar as a trap, yes


[7/18/2024 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
but nothing canonical in this regard


[7/18/2024 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
Here's an alternative idea though...

When the Divine Presence creates Hkar + the humans, there is literally something metaphysical of themselves that is embedded in Hkar or a part of Hkar. This strengthens and empowers the divine spark in the humans.

During the Downfall Wars, the agents of the Void Mind learn of this, and realize if they can possess and corrupt this whatever, they can destroy and corrupt everything that was imagined with the divine spark, perhaps even humanity itself, and dramatically weaken the Divine Prescene. End the ability to create, at some level.


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
And although the battle is still raging, and the Void Mind forces haven't won, it is too much of a risk. And so the Divine Prescence takes back this whatever which sinks Hkar


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
And metaphysically, makes them farther away from Taelgar, and makes the creation of new gods harder


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
weakens divine magic.


[7/18/2024 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
i think there is something in that


[7/18/2024 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
i think actually that cleans up a lot of the complications of the outer planes -- e.g. why is their a fixed set of outer planes and why are some not associated with deities?


[7/18/2024 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
It needs work, I think, but it plays back into the idea that the earlier and closer the humans are to Hkar, the easier it is to create gods. This explains why there are not so many new religions always forming (and maybe even the mariners too something of this power with them, which is why the east has more divine magic and more religions in general)


[7/18/2024 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not totally sure I want to say that *no* new gods appear after the downfall, but I think it works very well to have an "easy" era of god formation transition to a "hard" era. and that no new *planes* are formed after the downfall, perhaps excepting divine realms

(although metaphyiscally I think divine realms and non-divine outer planes are somewhat distinct)


[7/18/2024 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
and making that power embedded in the physical location of Hkar itself works well to explain Hkar's destruction


[7/18/2024 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
Right and it could explain some of the earliest outer planes


[7/18/2024 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus
and also perhaps why the elven empire that was in dunmar gets decimated. hobgoblin armies cut down hundreds of thousands of trees to construct a massive armanda


[7/18/2024 11:40 AM] .deciusmus
maybe in the first generation of humans, born themselves with the divine spark, and living on Hkar at the center of this magic literalyl create planes with their dreams. 

So places like Abyss/Hell/Aborea are the planes created by the dreams of the very first generation of humans.


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
then *populated* by the divine familiars created by the later generations?


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
not sure about that...


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
right, I like that


[7/18/2024 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
I gotta go do some work. but the other thing to think about is the vibe of the elves & other firstborn races....

At the end of the Downfall wars is it more like:

that was terrible but we won by our actions OR

that was terrible and we would have all been wiped out if Hkar didn't sink


[7/18/2024 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
(my instinct says the first is better, but not sure)


[7/18/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
I think my idea of the vibe of the downfall based on this new idea of the void mind wanting to corrupt hkar is that "without our actions, hkar would have been overwhelmed, but ultimately without the sinking of hkar the war could never have ended"

[7/18/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
so basically, destruction of hkar was a necessary cost, but without the price paid by the firstborn, probably the armies that reached hkar would have achieved their goal and captured the divine spark or whatever before hkar could be destroyed. something like that


[7/18/2024 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i have a bunch of meetings this afternoon but am going to try to rewrite the history of taelgar doc on the rewrite branch with these ideas

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/18/2024 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
have not got very far due to actual work, but throwing out this thought for comment, will likely pick up some more on this later today.

i think that the extraplanar geography needs a bit of rearranging. 

energy realms make total sense and I like the traditional D&D 5e Elemental Planes. The ethereal plane and the plane of magic connect nicely here. 

echo realms make total sense as well, although the shadowfell might need a little bit of thought. it isn't obvious that fey need two planes, and it is a natural locus for undead, so might make more sense as an undead plane in a sense, but need to think about that in the context of the metaphysics of death. 

however i'm increasingly feeling like the outer planes don't really work. there are canonically as many as perhaps four categories of "outer planes":
(1) the realms of the embodied gods, of which the dwarven Heart of the Mountain is the most well established
(2) the realms of incorporeal gods, of which Shakun's realm is the clearest, but which also canonically are not always a separate realm for each deity, e.g. Arkaash is supposed to be the realm of the Dunmari Pantehon
(3) what I've called the "primal realms": Arborea, the Abyss, Pandemonium, others. These are explicity not associated with deities, or at least not with the Divine Presence (but e.g. Pandemonium might be associated with Jinnik)
(4) the Dreamworld, the Land of the Dead, the Plane of Souls don't fit obviously into this, although it is canonically established that you can reach the Dreamworld via the Plane of Souls, and the Land of the Dead is a "dividing line" somehow for divine power
(5) the Astral Plane, which might not even exist? Or might be connected to the Plane of Souls and/or the Dreamworld


[7/18/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I think probably separating out the Primal Realms (with perhaps a different name) and associating these with the Riving, perhaps involving some Void Mind shenanigans, is much more straightforward than trying to force these things into the Divine Realms / Spiritual Realms


[7/18/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
then the embodied gods, incorporeal gods, dreamworld, land of dead, plane of souls are all "Age of Creation" things layered on top of the metaphysical structure created by the RIving


[7/18/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
and this also potentially creates space for e.g. undead to leak from the shadowfell, or lycanthropes from Pandemonium, or demons from the Abyss, in the age of creation


[7/18/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
I found the early campaign ‚Äúhell is made by humans because you imagine it‚Äù vibe kinda appealing. But it is potentially hard to fit into a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean there doesn't have to be a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôve never been happy with Shadowfell, honestly and it seems kinda odd. Didn‚Äôt you run a one shot for Riswynn in the Shadowfell or was that somewhere else?


[7/18/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the way the shadowfell has worked so far is not as a permanent echo realm but more like "domains of dread" like Ravenloft. mini-echo-realms created by some powerful trauma/evil/whatever


[7/18/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is kind of like fey domains in that the boss controls the vibe and the terrain echoes the material world, but very unlike in that you generally can't straightforwardly just walk across the borders


[7/18/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
and theoretically you could have mulitple overlapping shadowfell domains echoing the same spot


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that is more interesting and consistent with taelgar metaphysics than any kind of permanent equivalent of the feywild just in reverse


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but still thinking


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i have a meeting now but more later


[7/18/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
RIght I like that a lot - Shadowfell per se doesn't exist, and perhaps there isn't even a specific word/language/culture/whatever.... But there are a bunch of shadowy/dark echo realms, with a kind-of anti-life vibe...

That fits well with Delwath's backstory as well


[7/18/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
A few thoughts for later..

(1) Agree on energy realms / plane of magic / etheral plane from the Riving
(2) Agree on Shadowfell not fey & not a thing but more a type of mini-echo realm
(3) Not sure about undead. Do undead really need a plane? It seems to me that they are very much a material plane phenomena. Doesn't mean a vampire or lich couldn't create a "shadowfell" domain of dread, but I don't think that the undead really need a "home plane" in any sense
(4) Agree that the core "divine" realms and the core "primal" realms should be thought of separately. 
(5) Agree that the Dreamworld/Land Of Dead/Plane of Souls needs separate thought


[7/18/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Some questions:

(a) how does a divine realm come to be? I don't know the answer but my instinct says that the embodied gods & the incorporeal gods probably create them the same way. I think if it is in some sense under the gods control that explains a lot of the differences, i.e. Shakun created her own realm for Reasons rather than joining the realm of the Dunmari family, which was one realm for Reasons. 
(a - 1) if the gods create the divine realms, that kinda means that until the pantheonic era, there were no divine realms for humans
(a - 2) how does this relate to souls, which are pretty well established as "returning to their deity" after death in some fashion
(a - 3) how does this relate to small gods ideas of death, where there is no divine realm?
(a - 4) what about Thark and other embodied void mind gods. Can they create divine realms as well?


[7/18/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
(b) What is the Plane of Souls / Dreamworld / Land of Dead and when was it created? 

The canon we have so far suggests that the Plane of Souls and Dreamworld are closely connected, and also closely connected to the *living*. The plane of souls is like an echo realm almost, but just echoing the souls of those who are alive on taelgar. (Maybe it is an echo realm, creating in the Riving?)

The Dreamworld is has very little canon to it, other than as a place of imagination/dreams/possibilities. I used it in my game once as a place where the party was trapped during a cursed sleep. 

Here's what we wrote in college, which actually still feels kinda right:

The Dreamworld: The Dreamworld is an echo, shadow, and premonition of Taelgar.¬† The Dreamworld is a realm that contains echoes of the present, past, and future blended together.¬† Prophecy, and the ability to sense the past associations of an object are strongly tied to connections to the Dreamworld.¬† The Dreamworld can also, under the influence of a powerful master, be used to send messages, influence dreams, and similar things.¬† It is at once a part of, and not a part of, Taelgar.


[7/18/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
So thinking about this a bit when I should be working it feels like metaphysically, the Plane of Souls and the Dreamworld are really a sort of echo realm, and probably created in the Riving, and actually might be very different from the land of the dead


[7/18/2024 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure this long stream of conscious is helpful, but what about something like the following....

(1) In the aftermath of the Riving, the planes are separated, and at least the Energy Realms, Ethereal Realm, Plane of Magic, and the Echo Realms (including the Feywild, the Dreamworld, the Plane of Souls, plus any other random planes like the Mirror Realm and the rumored Nightmare Realm) are created. Plus of course the Material Plane

(2) the embodied gods create their divine realms as they see fit, as they are created. TBD is what about the Void Mind gods, and can they create realms to? Probably yes, but they might not all want to, given the void mind vibe.

(3a) maybe the Land of the Dead is explicitly created as a buffer between the gods and Taelgar during the Downfall, in response to the Void Mind attacks? That could be a mechanism for explaining why it became harder for belief to create gods. (Although this might be too big a change and not quite fit the already established religious history). (3b) Alternatively, maybe the Land of the Dead is in some sense part of the creation of humans. So before the land of the dead, the firstborn souls were taken up by their gods directly from Taelgar.


[7/18/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like the implications of (3b) that unleashing the divine spark into the multiverse had other consequences


[7/18/2024 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
Ok..here's a story. What do you think?

In the beginning, magic was all there was. In the Age of Myth before time, there was no life or death, per se, no mortality, and no souls. Magic fueled everything, and time didn't have meaning. Everything that lived at this time was in some sense a being of pure magic.

Then, in the Riving, as the magic of the multiverse was being ordered into the Energy & Ethereal & Magic Planes, the Divine introduced something new: souls. Not made of magic, but something else, that have never existed before.

And the embodied gods & the plane of souls were both shaped out of soul stuff, this new thing. And the embodied gods used the power of their soul stuff to guide and create living beings from the soul stuff in the plane of souls, and shape a new kind of life. As the first souls died, and drifted back to the plane of souls, the embodied gods recognized their work, and swept their souls up, and built realms for them, also out of soul stuff


[7/18/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
This continued for a while (and as an aside, Thark fits in nicely here as perverse creation, not really made of soul stuff at all, not properly, and so he is only able to steal the soul stuff from the other gods and chain and bind it, not create it himself)...

And then the Divine created humans. Humans were a new thing again, made of soul stuff but without a creator or guide, with the power of their soul stuff to shape things intact, rather than skimmed by the embodied gods (this sounds like I'm making Cha'mutte's point, embodied gods as leechs)...

And the Divine made the land of the dead for them, so the human soul stuff could have a place to go when it died. And when the early humans died, before their were any gods, they imagined out of their own soul stuff, the primal realms


[7/18/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
So the history of the planes is basically 3 events:

(a) the Riving establishes the Echo/Energy/Ethereal Realsm
(b) in the same moment as the Riving, the creation of souls establishes the Plane of Souls (and the Dreamworld, which is basically an echo plane of the Plane of Souls)
(c) at the time of creation of humans, the Land of the Dead is created

Then, all the "outer" planes (Primal + Spiritual) are built either by human belief, with the power of their soul-stuff, or by embodied or incorporeal gods, with the power of the soul-stuff of their dead followers

In the early days, the human souls were not flowing to any gods, so the primal planes came to be. But then, as the gods developed, human soul-stuff became more and more a purview of the gods, rather than free-floating human belief.

But in theory, metaphysically, if all the humans decided to stop believing/worshipping the gods, you'd go back to a time when human belief could create new primal planes


[7/18/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
need to think about this all a bit but a few additional points:
(1) Agree that that Dreamworld is functionally an echo realm of the Plane of Souls - I think this has been established in game already, early on actually in Kenzo's dream journey way back in Karawa. The key distinction between the Dreamworld and what I would call true echo realms is that the geography of the Dreamworld is not tied to the physical geography of the material plane. Shadowfell domains, the Feywild, and the MIrror Realm have, so far, been demonstrated to be geographic echoes (distorted perhaps) of the Material Plane
(2) Agree that the Land of the Dead is a dividing line of sorts, between the Plane of Souls / Material Plane / echo realms / whatever and the Divine Realms. This is established as well, at least in my secret notes if not in game, and is consistent with a lot of undead lore and lore around resurrection/raise dead etc. (it takes much stronger magic to bring back a soul that has 'passed on')


[7/18/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Not positive I agree that the Land of the Dead is a human thing / created originally for humans, and need to think about the primal realms as imagined by dead humans out of their soul stuff


[7/18/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure I agree with any of the above either; its more one potential idea that at least has a unifying mechanic


[7/18/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Going back to your questions, re: how does a divine realm come to be, I think this is "it is created by a divinity" and that the distinction between embodied and incorporeal gods here is not particularly meaningful. 

How this relates to souls and dead is, I think, fairly clear in my mind as well. The "Spiritual Realms" writ large are basically places where souls can exist, and if they don't eventually end up in one of the "Spiritual Realms", they fade from existence into nothingness. 

Re: Thark, at least in some sense this has to be yes, otherwise orcs from last session wouldn't believe they could poison him with their souls.


[7/18/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there is an unresolved question about the souls of humans who are not taken up by one of the major divinities with an extraplanar realm, and I think there is still an unresolved question about where the non-god-associated spiritual realms come from


[7/18/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
Re: Thark, I'm not sure Thark has to be able to create a divine realm for orcs to believe they can poison him, right? He just has to have some type of existence that is in  place they can reach him. Although a divine realm is probably simplest


[7/18/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
re: echo realms.

My thinking is that an echo realm is just a echo of the Riving, and, in some sense, could be an echo of something other than Taelgar. So the Dreamworld is an echo of the creation of the plane of souls or whatever.

Is it necessary to assume all echo realms are an echo of the plane of taelgar? Maybe dragons all live in some echo of the plane of magic.


[7/18/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
What's different about the echo realms is they are sorta created by accident. 

Whereas the energy realms are the separation of the stuff of the multiverse from before the Riving.

And the spiritual realms are created by divine beings, on purpose.

(primal realms TBD)


[7/18/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Agree on Echo realms vs Energy realms as you describe - no not all echo realms need to echo the material plane


[7/18/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I think "primal realms" is the wrong word FWIW, at least in some old notes I have 
Arcane magic = Energy realms, plane of magic
Divine magic = Spiritual Realms, Divine Presence
Primal magic = Echo realms, resonances of the Riving


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Interesting


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
but I agree


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
not committed to that as canonical but it is interesting and fits in at least with some centaur lore


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
"outer planes" is the best shorthard term for now, but clearly not the right taelgaresque term


[7/18/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. At some point we need to clarify a bit what fey magic is. Because eventually Kiya is going to want to know exactly how Celyn feels different when he casts a fey spell vs a divine spell


[7/18/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
But putting that aside, I agree that primal is the wrong word.


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Re: magic, I actually think in some ways my older notes are wrong, and there is no reason for such broad generalizations. All magic on Taelgar is the manipulation of extraplanar energy, yes. But mechanically, any player who cares can choose some reasonable source of extraplanar energy to be what they manipulate


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't mean to suggest that "primal" = "rangers and druids"


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Or at least, I didn't read it that way


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
More, I was thinking you meant "there is a 3rd kind of magical ressonance, from the echo realms, which is a different type of magic than arcane or divine"


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
in our high school notes we called this "the magic of Taelgar"


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, but what I'm suggesting is the idea that there are three categories is maybe wrong


[7/18/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
"Plane of Magic" magic and "Pray to Deity" magic are the most common and easiest, perhaps. But "feywild magic", "elemental plane magic", and "other outer plane" magic could all exist


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so if you wanted to play a storm sorcerer or something maybe you don't use traditional "arcane" magic from the plane of magic, but use "elemental magic" from the elemental planes


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
or a circle of dreams druid maybe uses "dreamworld magic"


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
right, I see.


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[7/18/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, a bit far afield from the original discussion. still going to try to type up the history notes, and maybe will try to incorporate some comments on the extraplanar stuff as `%% %%` notes


[7/18/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking about making a stab at updating the cosmology section briefly with this


[7/18/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure if we've agreed to anything


[7/18/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps just that Dreamworld/land of dead don't belong in Spiritual relams and that the Riving created at least

(a) energy + magic + ethereal
(b) dreamworld + plane of souls

And that the divine spiritual realms were crated by gods, separately
and that the primal realms should be renamed but we don't have a good alternate name


[7/18/2024 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
Also perhaps that the Shadowfell has nothing to do with the fey


[7/18/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe add some notes to the overall multiverse page. i'm not sure anything is settled enough to be worth revising the organization of the cosmology section yet


[7/18/2024 5:10 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is something to be said for "de-canonifying" the current division, i.e. by 
- moving stuff that isn't definitely a spirtual realm out of spiritual realms
- getting rid of "primal realms" as a catagory


[7/18/2024 5:11 PM] .deciusmus
might play around in a PR-branch


[7/18/2024 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
working a bit more on this and wondering about this:

The Riving is actually several ordered events, although the time between them is undefined as the linear progression of time doesn't really make sense until the Riving ends:

1) The Divine Presence separates the material plane from the energy and echo realms, making a place that, while not devoid of magic, is much more stable and safe.

2) The Divine Presence spins out from itself the raw material for souls, which are basically like little fragments of the divine, creating the Plane of Souls as a kind of undifferentiated swirl. 

3) The Divine Presence creates out of itself the Embodied Gods, and gives them the power to shape soul stuff, but creates the land of the dead as a barrier, limiting the ability of souls to influence the Divine Presence or act beyond the material plane. 

4) The Embodied gods use the soul stuff to create the elves, dwarves, etc, and create their personal domains beyond the land of the dead. This ends the Riving and starts the Age of Creation.


[7/18/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, the creation of humanity is the moment when the Divine Presence allows a break in the Land of the Dead. Humanity is given the divine spark to shape divinity. The incorporeal gods are created because of this barrier.


[7/18/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
The Downfall seals this barrier again, but quite completely


[7/18/2024 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
Actually implies separating the world out into four mythic eras again, with creation of humans as a dividing line, but I think neatly wraps some things up


[7/18/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
The period of time betwen the Creation of Humans and the Downfall is a period when it is relatively easy to create "outer planes". 

Some are created by human beliefs. Some are created by the Void Mind's agents, descendants, etc. Some maybe are created by strange and unlikely events.


[7/18/2024 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Afterward, after the Downfall, the metaphysical world is largely fixed. But the barrier is not **completely** sealed, to leave open the possibility of weird stuff, new gods, as needed


[7/18/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
I like the first part, but I don't think it needs to be a set of linearly ordered events exactly. Is causality even unidirectional in the Age of Myth? Aerin going back to before the Riving somehow creates kenku, right? Who says that order has meaning?


[7/18/2024 6:38 PM] .deciusmus
But sure, from a "untangling for ease of understanding" I like it


[7/18/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, I guess for ease of human minds to understand it makes sense to say in some way creation of the plane of souls and creation of embodied gods has to precede the creation of the elder folk but in metaphysical reality causality doesn't have to be unidirection


[7/18/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
So the mythic history becomes:

all magic, no souls
soul stuff created, but its influence is locked to Taelgar itself
door opened, soul stuff can influence the metaverse
oops, that's too dangerous, patch it up by the door can never be fully closed


[7/18/2024 6:41 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, yes


[7/18/2024 6:42 PM] rsulfuratus
what I like about it is that it allows for any random "outer plane" someone wants to make, and no reason for it fit into a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
Right so basically an ‚Äúouter plane‚Äù is just something created with soul stuff at some level


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
But each outer plane can / should have a specific origin story


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
I like that a lot actually


[7/18/2024 6:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that I would the astral plane basically the undifferentiated soulstuff beyond the land of the dead (while the plane of souls is the differentiated soulstuff on the material plane side of the land of the dead)


[7/18/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and then any plane made of soulstuff floats in the astral plane and has some kind of origin story


[7/18/2024 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm not convinces the astral plane needs to exist


[7/18/2024 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
Is it too religious-vibe to have soul stuff be the Divine Presence?


[7/18/2024 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is it too religious-vibe to have the soul stuff be the Divine Presence. And also is probably inconsistent with it being shaped into outer planes by Void Mind things


[7/18/2024 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is the Divine Presence imbuing some if its creative magic into something new


[7/18/2024 6:52 PM] rsulfuratus
also re: astral plane, I think it is useful to have a way to travel to the outer planes that isn't plane shift


[7/18/2024 6:52 PM] .deciusmus
Are elven , dwarven , and human souls different in some metaphysical way?

What about the idea that the divine presence basically creates the astral plane - the source of soul stuff - in imitation or learning from the plane of magic - and elves and dwarves and everyone else is created when the embodied gods pass the soul stuff from the astral plane to the plane of souls


[7/18/2024 6:55 PM] .deciusmus
Humans are the first souls that go freely in some sense which is why they have the divine spark

pretty busy today but noodling a bit when I have time. Rewrote the summary as:

The **Age of Myth**, when the multiverse was new, a period before time itself was created. The Age of Myth begin with the first act of creation and are a time of the archfey, titans, elements, and great wyrms, a time when the power of arcane magic coursed unchecked through the multiverse and altering reality was as simple as a thought. This age ends with [[The Riving]] when the [[Divine Presence]] separates the planes of existence from each other and creates the [[Material Plane]]. This was a time of huge empires and incredible acts of magic, but also of much chaos.

The **Age of Creation** began after [[The Riving]], when the multiverse was created, and ended with the [[Creation of Humans]] and the breaking of the barriers that contained and constrained the creative force of ~soulstuff~. It was during the Age of Creation that the [[Elder Folk|oldest sentient species]] of Taelgar were created by [[Embodied Gods]], when the vast civilizations of [[elves]], [[Dwarves|dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and others spread across the world. This is the golden age of the non-human species, but also a time that lacked dynamism. Little changed or was truly new in this age, as the Firstborn of the Elder Folk encouraged sameness and uniformity.


[7/19/2024 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
The **Age of Divinity** began with the [[Creation of Humans]], and the shattering of the walls that isolated the [[Material Plane]] and kept the creative force of ~soulstuff~ from affecting the wider multiverse. Humans, created by the [[Divine Presence]] itself on [[Hkar]], were unlike anything that had come before, for they were granted the Divine Spark, the ability of their beliefs to shape the very reality of the multiverse, creating [[Incorporeal Gods]] out of the material of creation itself. This was an age of great change, as the greatest hopes and darkest fears of humanity were manifest in ~soulstuff~. It was also an age when other, darker things were created by the machinations of the [[Void Mind]]. The Age of Divinity ended with the the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the destruction of [[Hkar]], and the diminishment of the power of the Divine Spark on the [[Material Plane]]. 

The **Age of Humanity** began with the sinking of [[Hkar]] and the reshaping of the world that accompanied the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. This age saw the rise and fall of Drankor, and the rise and fall of Cha'mutte, and much growth and change among human cultures. This age saw, for the first time, humanity growing to dominant the cultures of Taelgar, and the history of this age is dominated by the history of humanity.

One comment:

> Throughout the long [[Age of Creation]], the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation, through which only the [[Embodied Gods]] could reach


[7/19/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure it matters, but is this metaphysically true? Also, if the barrier is truely strong, does that mean there are no clerics / divine magic until humans are created?


[7/19/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure the metaphysics of the barrier matter nor questions like where do souls come from.


[7/19/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
Implication is supposed to be that divine magic comes from the firstborn who can reach through. But agree probably not worth spending a ton of time on


[7/19/2024 1:15 PM] rsulfuratus
But metaphysically just supposed to set up the contrast with age of divinity when outer planes get created beyond those associated with embodied gods


[7/19/2024 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
right. might be worth clarifying the impact, i.e. (although secondarily, could the embodied gods reach through easily, i.e. unlike in the current age, could gods act more easily and directly on the world?)


Throughout the long [[Age of Creation]], the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation. Although the [[Embodied Gods]] could reach across this barrier, to grant miracles and change the Material Plane, the magic of souls could not act, except through the Embodied Gods.

re: multiverse, pushed this:

While there are many ways to describe the multiverse, the most widely known comes from elven scholars, who describe the multiverse a pair of intersecting domes: the below, the dome of the physical planes rising from the roiling chaos of the [[Plane of Magic]]; above, the dome of the planes of sentience, descending from the blinding intensity of the [[Plane of Creation]].  

The duality of the [[Material Plane]] -- the physical structures of the universe -- and the [[Plane of Souls]] -- the soul structures of the sentient inhabitants of the universe -- sit in the middle of these domes, the Material Plane anchored to the dome of physicality, the Plane of Souls anchored to the dome of sentience. 

Descending "below" the material plane in this cosmology is the [[Ethereal Plane]], which stretches from the border ethereal, co-localizing with the material plane, through the interior ethereal, a foggy expanse of swirling mists, to the deep ethereal, which bleeds into the [[Plane of Magic]]. Embedded within the "sea" of the [[Ethereal Plane]] are the [[Energy Realms]], chief among them the [[Elemental Planes]], domains of pure physicality, capturing the essence of the fundamental elements of the universe.


[7/19/2024 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
Floating "above" the plane of souls in this cosmology is the [[Astral Plane]], which is bisected by the [[Land of the Dead]], a collecting point for souls and an not-quite-impermeable barrier separating the raw energy of creation from the [[Material Plane]]. Beyond the [[Land of the Dead]], the [[Astral Plane]] is a strange empty expanse of silvery waves, in which the [[Spiritual Realms]] float like bubbles, until it merges with the blinding energy of the [[Plane of Creation]]. 

Layered on top of this cosmology, the elven scholars speak of the [[Echo Realms]], the distortions and reflections and reverberations of the planes created by [[The Riving]], which still resonance today. Most notably, these include the [[Feywild]], an echo of the material plane, and the [[Dreamworld]], an echo of the plane of souls, but others have been described, including the domains of the [[Shadowfell]], the [[Nightmare Realm]], and the [[Mirror Realm]].


[7/19/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
I like that. I was playing around with using Shadowfells (plural) rather than Shadowfell, as a way to express the idea of different independent domains better


[7/25/2024 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a rewrite of the history of taelgar (to history-rewrite) branch that restructures age of divinity into four eras:
- growth of humanity from ~1500-2200, when not much happens, basically pre-history
- contact with elder folk from ~2200-2500, when arcane magic + idea of incorporeal gods triggers massive social and cultural change on hkar
- migrations and emigration, from ~2500-3500, starting with the northerner departures and ending with the marniner departures, with at least one (the southerener) migration in between, but possibly more
- arcane hegemony, from ~3500-4122, when the arcane urban culture gets very powerful, mos numena develops, etc; ends with downfall


[7/25/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
logic is basically that contact with elder folk / introduction of arcane magic breaks a long period of status and the social change associated triggers people to start leaving. northerners would be the last of the "small gods" people, after they depart hkar is all pantheonic. mariners are potentially the last (major) non-mos-numena culture, after they leave mos numena gets increaasingly strong and other religious communities (e.g., dunmari?) get increasingly isolated, tend to leave


[7/25/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
the dates are not precise in the doc I pushed and could be shifted


[7/26/2024 9:12 AM] rsulfuratus
working a bit on filling in multiverse / cosmology detail from the riving, and wondering about your feelings about the connection between metaphysics and mechanics. 

for example, at the moment based on the way magic is set up in world, there isn't an obvious way to play a fey cleric. unless you have an unusual backstory where you came to worship a "foreign god"

not sure how i feel about that? 

it particularly impacts the children of the divine, although also potentially also impacts the "unusual species" 

more generally, the basic logic of "divine magic is miracles granted by a god" poses a bit of a challenge for societies that don't seem to innately have gods (centaurs, merfolk, fey, etc) - do they also not have divine magic? and if they don't have divine magic is that a mechanical thing or can they have "clerics" just who generate the same effects from non-divine magic?


[7/26/2024 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea of divine magic = miracles granted by a god and in general feel like it‚Äôs better to not get too focused on D&D mechanics


[7/26/2024 10:07 AM] .deciusmus
But I do think there is a bit of a gap around non-arcane / non-divine magic


[7/26/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
That is, clearly on Taelgar there is:
Arcane casters who channel the plane of magic somehow
Divine casters who specifically get miracles from their gods
‚ÄúOther casters‚Äù = lots of other magical things that are currently somewhat ill defined in the metaphysics


[7/26/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
I think that ‚Äúother‚Äù category is where things like fey clerics and merfolk clerics would fall


[7/26/2024 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm thinking more about two distinct gaps. 

1) Do we care about matching mechanics to lore? That is, cleric/paladin spells in D&D have a certain flavor that is distinct from especially wizard spells. In some cases we've adopted D&D mechanics into lore (e.g., resurrection magic), in other cases not. Is there a reason to think that there are certain kinds of magical effects that are far more straightforward to create by divine magic than other ways? In some sense I think this is already in the lore to a certain extent, e.g. divine miracles tend to be around healing, things like that, but people don't go to a hedge wizard for healing and "Chardonian arcane magical energy" is not really focused around healing, it is things like controlling the wind, minor cantrips for cleaning and light, that kind of thing. Putting aside PC mechanics, is it therefore good or bad to have this play a significant role in worldbuilding, that is should, e.g., fey culture lean heavily away from healing, bless, that type of thing which is coded as "divine magic"? 

(2) Separately, it sometimes feels as if there is something of a gap in the divine order. Is it really the case that *every* society that is not either human or one of the elder folk (including orcs) just doesn't worship gods at all? maybe yes, but I'm not sure I agree


[7/26/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
Re: other magic, I guess I haven't really seen this as a gap? Magic is just applying extraplanar energy to defy typical physics so the source of that extraplanar energy can come from anywhere. 

Fey magic is just manipulating the resonances of the Riving to alter material plane physics using "fey logic". 

Many druids might use resonances of the Elemental Planes, others might use the natural echos of the Riving in the Material Plane itself.


[7/26/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
(More in a bit)


[7/26/2024 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
A few quick thoughts...

(a) I do think that the general "tone" of divine vs arcane magic works, but also I think it doesn't have to be extremely precise or pre-decided. Fey for example seem like they'd lean heavily into enchantments and illusions but I wouldn't worry too much if that crosses the "cleric" vibe boundary (i.e. bless feels like a fey spell, maybe with a different gloss, but healing maybe less so in general). And I think it is good that Chardonian hedge wizards don't know healing spells.

(b) I actually like that gods are a specific thing, not just this idea that every culture has to have a god. I'm not sure that means that no cultures can worship anything at all... isn't the idea of the "arch fey/great wrym/elder elemental/titan"  vibe to set up this alternative power structure that can provide god-like creatures in cultures were it makes sense?


[7/26/2024 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
It may be interesting to explore, what, if anything, is the metaphyiscal difference between the children of the divine vs embodied gods vs children of belief


[7/26/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the part I'm uncertain about is what is, exactly, an archfey? or a great wyrm?


[7/26/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
the lore developing around the early days / mythic history strongly focuses on humanity as the creative force behind "outer planes", with some impact of embodied gods


[7/26/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
but if the "outer planes" are strongly tied to elder folk + humans, where are all the titans of old?


[7/26/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
So one direction is to play into the idea of the "plane of creation / soul stuff" as something that the children of the divine lack access to. The titans are somewhere else, not an outer realm, but somewhere associated with the "lower planes" in your cosmology


[7/26/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
The other direction, I think, is to say that's wrong, and all the children of the divine presence are sorta similar


[7/26/2024 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
right, I think this is the fundamental vibe check I'm looking for


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
and so titans and great wyrms and archfey are really not metaphyically different from embodied gods or human gods


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
metaphyiscally, is there something really very different about the first creations of the divine presence (elder elementals, titans, etc) and the second creations of the divine presence (embodied gods)


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
right exactly


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure the answer


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
the details, I think, don't matter too much, but the vibe makes a big difference. especially on fey lore


[7/26/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
and kiya's questions about ultimately what is different between fey magic and wyrdling magic


[7/26/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
What happens when a fey dies is an interesting question


[7/26/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think it is easier to work out the vibes via thinking about whether there is something different about fey / giants / centaurs / merfolk / etc vs elves / dwarves / orcs / humans


[7/26/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Which I am torn on... on the one hand, one of the things I like about the metaphysics is this idea of the "firstborn" vs "humans" and the metaphysical differences


[7/26/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
On the other hand, I don't love priviledging one group of species as "real people with souls" and therefore implying centaurs / fey etc don't have souls in the same way


[7/26/2024 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
but if centaurs or merfolk are the same as elves, what makes the "elder races" special and distinct?


[7/26/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
from one perspective, it is just because they were created in the age of creation, there is nothing else really distinct about them. just a question of timing, really


[7/26/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure I agree / like that, but it is a possibility


[7/26/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
the firstborn are also the first entities that are called gods at least, and basically invent the concept of "deity"


[7/26/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe the root cause of Cha'mutte's war is that he was angry the so-called Firstborn claimed all the credit for their fancy ideas about "divinity" when really the true children of the divine were there are along. recast it as like a divine sibling war from greek myth


[7/26/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
on a mechanical level, I don't think it works for fey, etc to be "soulless", fwiw. putting aside any lore reasons, we also have for example the canonical fact of agata's soul hiding out in Seeker's ring


[7/26/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
Right, agreed


[7/26/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
Getting in car to drive Z but I‚Äôll ponder more


[7/26/2024 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
So, a few thoughts while I eat lunch...


[7/26/2024 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
a) I think as first principles we should lean towards sticking with the basic idea around "firstborn (+orcs)" vs "humans" vs "hobgoblins" and that, atlhough it doesn't have to be canon that the firstborn are special and different, we should try to make that work before changing it. 

b) I think we are agreed that there is a wide variety of sentient creatures on Taelgar that are neither humans/hobgoblins/firstborn/orcs, but that nevertheless have a soul (in the sense of a essence that is distinct from the material body and that can be ressurected, banished, stolen, trapped, etc


[7/26/2024 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
c) From a vibes perspective, I think there are clear divisions within the sentient creatures between "species" and "magical entities". WIthout necessarily getting into a sidetrack about where do babies come from and so on, there is definitely a different vibe around say fey - who are all a "type" but where hags don't so obviously start life as baby hags vs say dwarves, elves, or kenku, who all clearly have some type of species continuity


[7/26/2024 1:28 PM] rsulfuratus
So, just throwing out some thoughts. Part my impetus for thinking about this is the idea of the ‚Äúbarrier of the land of the dead‚Äù, which sets up a very strong metaphysical distinction between eg demons (who cannot be killed on an ‚Äúinner plane‚Äù, merely banished), and ‚Äúcreatures of the ~inner planes~


[7/26/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
But then you get the problem of what all these other species are?


[7/26/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
And I guess I lean towards they all basically work the same way at a fundamental metaphysical level


[7/26/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Which isn‚Äôt to say the ‚Äúelder folk‚Äù isn‚Äôt a meaningful category


[7/26/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
But, on the other hand, the centaurs are the star of their own story too


[7/26/2024 1:32 PM] rsulfuratus
Which I think is consitdtent with your point (b)


[7/26/2024 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
One stab at a synthesis...

In the Age of Myth, all was changeable, and the flexibility of raw magical energy meant that although an infinite number of things could be created, at the same time nothing was "real". Only the children of the divine, not their creations, had permenance/self/soul, for they had been given soul-stuff by the Divine. These direct children of the divine are rare and powerful, basically they are the same as the embodied gods metaphysically. 

In the moment of the RIving, however, with the creation of the Astral Plane and the the Plane of Creation, the echoes and reverberations allowed this soul stuff to be "caught" by some of the echoes and creations of the Children of the Divine, giving them permeance and self, and power, in some sense proportional to the luck/skill/whatever that allowed one fey bundle of magic to catch much more of the essence of creation than another


[7/26/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
... I'm not totally sure where I am going with this


[7/26/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
But I guess the thought was to set up a distinction between

(a) fey and elementals, in particular, who are more creations of the echo realms, in some way, than creations of any particular god
(b) set up fey in particular as having a gradient of power. Some arch fey are much more powerful than others, and I wonder if any of the original, god-like children of the divine archfey really still exist?


[7/26/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is fine as far as it goes


[7/26/2024 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I‚Äôm more thinking about though, from a basic ‚Äúsoul‚Äù point of view, what‚Äôs the line? 

In current lore, you have humans/elder folk with clear metaphysics, and everything else very vague. 

I‚Äôm leaning toward something that is more: any sentient, self-aware being on Taelgar is, in some way, partially made of ~soul stuff~


[7/26/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
The details can be blurry and variable for different species, of course


[7/26/2024 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
The one plausible exception might Far Realm aberrations


[7/26/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
I also think there is potentially a reasonable way to make a metaphysical distinction between some different types of creatures, specifically:

(a) the echo/inner realm inhabitants - in particular fey and elementals, but maybe some others as well, who clearly have souls but also, I am pretty sure, don't have "creator gods" and also have (I think) wide variants in power between different ones of the same "type"

(b) the demons/devils/angels/etc - outer plane inhabitants - who are, in some sense, "native soul stuff", and are much more directly tied to the energy of creation and the barrier of the land of the dead and so on

(c) far realms creatures, who I think definitely don't have Taelgarian souls at all, and are odd and unique and come from "elsewhere"

(d) the elder folk (+ orcs), whose soul stuff was distinctly, uniquely, and specifically shaped by their firstborn (+ maybe the kenku, pending Aerin's specifics)

(e) humans, whose soul stuff is explicitly shaped/given by the Divine Presence and has the Divine Spark

(f) the unique creatures: centaurs merfolk kobolds giants at least, maybe others. But what distinguishes unique creatures from elder folk + humans is that, for whatever reason, their soul stuff did not come from a god or other specific "divine" entity


[7/26/2024 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
What really distinguishes (d) from (f) is not metaphysics but origin. The creaturs in (d) are a unique category because they have gods who shape their soul stuff into their species. The creatures in (f) do not have gods, or at least, if they worship something, it isn't their creator


[7/26/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think all makes sense. Although for example merfolk might very workshop the sentient ocean, who is their creature but not a god (in the sense of being a being of ‚Äúcreative energy‚Äù)


[7/26/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
*worship


[7/26/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
So metaphysically, devils are functionally gods, just very weak ones


[7/26/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
As being of ‚Äúpure soul stuff‚Äù


[7/26/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
Right in the case of the merfolk the metaphysics are probably very different than say dwarves. The sentient ocean as a Far Realm being has no access to "taelgar soul stuff" in the way an embodied god would, and whatever magic was used to create/awaken/etc the merfolk they got their souls in some different way than being given them by the sentient ocean


[7/26/2024 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. Although the same is true of ghosts and dead humans, right?


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Hmm. I‚Äôm not sure why the sentient ocean couldn‚Äôt have access to ~soul stuff~. I think what I‚Äôm arguing for is thinking of -soul stuff- as essentially another force like magic


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
But obviously a lot harder to use


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess being made of soul stuff and being able to access it for magic are two different things


[7/26/2024 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
so, to summarize, I think the logic is:

(1) major divisions of living or sort-of-living things in Taelgar:

(a) Sentient, self-aware creatures that are native to the "inner realms" (echo realms + energy realms + anything else that might be invented that is "protected" from the raw power of the Plane of Creation by the Land of the Dead), are sentient and self-aware because they are animated by a fragment of ~soulstuff~. When they die, this fragment typically travels to the Land of the Dead, and eventually passes beyond into the "Outer Realms". 

(b) Sentient, self-aware creatures native to the "outer realms" (spiritual realms + astral plane + anything on the "Plane of Creation" side of the Land of the Dead) are pure beings of soulstuff, manifest into physical form. When killed in the "inner realms", they return to their native plane, possibly changed. They can only be fully destroyed when beyond the Land of the Dead. 

(c) Some creatures (many constructs, some undead, simlacrums, perhaps some elementals, etc) are sentient and self-aware but only by using the raw energy of the Plane of Magic in imitation of "soulstuff". These creatures simply cease to exist if destroyed, wherever they are.


[7/26/2024 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(d) Creatures from the Far Realms, where different rules apply.


[7/26/2024 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(e) Beasts or other kinds of non-self-aware, non-sentient creatures are just creatures


[7/26/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, most of the "interesting" distinctions are within (a), and this has a lot to do with origin stories and how each individual species / creature gained access to "soulstuff".


[7/26/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
This all fits pretty well with the Creating New Species document, although I think the distinctions in (a) probably don't map well onto that document


[7/26/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the big vibe shift is kind of opening things up to diverse ways that various non-divine entities might have had access to "soul stuff magic" to create things


[7/26/2024 2:11 PM] .deciusmus
I would also add that I think it is worth establishing that within (a) there is basically 3 categories:

(a) humans, who were given Divine-Spark-enabled soul stuff directly from the Divine Presence
(b) the "created" races (elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk, stoneborn, orcs, and maybe kenku) who are distinguished via the story of a creator god who specifically shaped them
(c) other (everyone else) whose only real distinguishing trait should be that they are not (b)


[7/26/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I'm not sure how that plays out exactly, but I still think it is important to preserve something unique about the "firstborn" races


[7/26/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
That is, I guess I mean, I still think it is worth thinking about how (b) is different from (c) in a way that provides a canonical reason why centaurs and merfolk were not targeted by Cha'mutte


[7/26/2024 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I would say that the clear metaphyiscal uniqueness there is actually in the nature of the embodied gods


[7/26/2024 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
that is, you have say four (currently) types of beings that are "made of soulstuff"


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
(a) the children of the divine
(b) the embodied gods
(c) the incorporeal gods and everything related to them (which would, in this case, stretch to natives of "outer planes")
(d) the divine presence themselves


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
the unique think about the firstborn is they are the only sentient species created by (b)


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right so the idea would be that actually you have a distinction like

(a) humans, created by Divine Presence
(b) firstborn, created by the Embodied Gods, who are a specific group with unique commonalities 
(c) others, created by something or someone else, who is definitely not an Embodied God, because the embodied gods are specific group of entities


[7/26/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[7/26/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually think this implies perhaps a bit of revision of the void mind and the three despairs, to make Thark unique as the only embodied god among the Void Mind creations

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/26/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
which is in practice how things have played out in game, with Thark clearly distinct from e.g. Jinnik


[7/26/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
It also suggests that the earlier statement - that there is nothing special about the embodied gods - is probably wrong


[7/26/2024 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there is nothing special in the sense that they, like the children of the divine and the incorporeal gods, are "powerful beings made of the energy of creation"

but, metaphysically, there is something unique about the way they are created that is distinct from the way the children of the divine or the incorporeal gods are created


[7/26/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
the original idea is that they are physically embodied in a way the incorporeal gods are not, and so are not tied to belief in the same way. so there are differences


[7/26/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
Radical thought: should titans elder elementals arch fey great worms actually still exist?


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
what, like Cha'mutte was the last of his kind?


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
What if, for the most part, they were somehow consumed/destroyed/turned into echos during the Riving


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
although that raises questions. like, what is Gazankoa if not an elder elemental?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
or the various archfey?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
or, i guess, maybe the point is there were once *even more powerful* versions of these that disappeared?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that was the idea


[7/26/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
The archfey are just really powerful fey now. None of the existing arch fey were actually alive in any meaningful sense before the riving


[7/26/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure that is an important detail to decide on at the moment, but worth keeping in mind


[7/26/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I guess its more a vibe-thing: I don't think we should necessarily think of Ethlenn and Gazankoa and Cha'mutte as necessarily "siblings" or "part of the same creation"


[7/26/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
or even "the same type of thing" in the way that Elmerca and the Bahazeal are "the same type of thing"


[7/26/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, from a vibes perspective I think that makes sense, but also there could have been a lot of diversity pre-Riving. and how would you even remember stuff if linear casuality doesn't work? it is possible that entities that survived the riving emerged deeply changed


[7/26/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a meeting at 2:30 but am going to try to edit the creating new species doc and clean up a few lingering history of taelgar edits and then make PR to merge the history-rewrite branch later this afternoon or tonight

{Reactions}
üëç

[7/26/2024 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
I left a few notes about the species stuff... but go ahead and merge I liked all the timeline stuff


[7/26/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm slightly editing the species doc. my intention is not to suggest there are lots of additional species that are associated with dragons/fey/elementals/giants, but rather that giants, dragons (+kobolds), fey (many different species), and elementals (many different species) are their own thing separate from the more general "awakened/cursed/other" category


[7/26/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
are they necessarily though?


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
in practice I don't think it matters


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe not really


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm questioning whether, i.e. Titans should necessarily be considered canonical


[7/26/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
or whether it means anything to say "Dragons were [something] by great wyrms"


[7/26/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
I think that is maybe under considered and if we ever decided to make up the history of dragons and what they are precisely, the existence or not of great wryrms in the age of myth isn't super relevant


[7/26/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
same deal with giants; whether titans are a real thing or not I'm not sure it is meaning to say that giants are in some sense an "echo" of titans.


[7/26/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
This is more relevant to me in terms of the fey where I'm not at all convinced that the story is "archfey created fey" but maybe something more like "some type of essence that has been conceptualized as fey by the current fey existed before time and its transformation during the Riving created many different fey creatures, of widely varying power levels"


[7/26/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i am fairly attached to the idea that giants and dragons are somehow larger than life and have this history of being vastly more powerful, with echoes of that power (e.g., phasing stones, flying castles) lingering


[7/26/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the fey and elementals are distinct and in some ways more complicated and so perhaps not too helpful to lump all four groups together


[7/26/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Again, not sure it matters in the species doc; I'm really just arguing that sentient species - including fey/giants/elementals - should have some kind of unique creation story and/or a canonically blank space filled only with vibes


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'd rather say:

Giants and dragons are, in some sense, echoes or descendants or creations of the beings of pure magical energy that existed before the Riving


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
and than describe your vibe thing above


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/26/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think it solves some problems to just say the time before the Riving was in some sense unknowable and is vibes based only and be judicious about which existing structures on Taelgar echo back to a pre-Riving time.

Clearly giants, dragons, fey, and elementals do (although for different reasons) but I'm not sure it would be a problem if a fifth category came along that should also echo back to ancient days. But that doesn't necessarily imply the existing of some specific set of entities created by the Divine Presence


[7/26/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking about what is actually in game and not world building, I think:
- the vibe I described about giants and dragons is important, and also for giants some kind of history/echo of much stronger magic in the past that is connected to rune magic and the dwarven firstborn and such (leading to myths -- maybe true, maybe not -- that the Runecrafter learned magic from ~someone/something~ during the Riving)
- the fey are diverse and despite having different forms and power have a shared history, so it doesn't necessarily make sense to have a separate "origin story" for satyrs vs pixies, for example. the fey, writ large, have a kind of collective origin of some kind, dating to the riving
- elementals are similar, albeit someone more hierarchical and ordered, and much more commonly soullles magical creations (most standard "water elementals" or whatever are this) than fey are, and they are orgainzed around rulers of each domain (e.g., marid, djinni, efreeti, dao), who in tern owe allegiance to some kind of "elemental powers" of which gazankoa is the only named example


[7/26/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes that dynamic (unknowable, vibes based) probably makes sense


[7/26/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
for pre-riving "history"


[7/26/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I agree about all of that, but I actually think it is more important to, i.e. state that the fey, as a "type of creature" have a shared origin that dates to the Riving than to try to say that "archfey" existing before the riving and fey are somehow related.

and I also think that "echoes of the Riving" is a potentially more flexible category than just fey/elementals/dragons/giants but also doesn't necessarily include say kobolds and trolls even though kobolds are dragon-ish and trolls are giant-ish


[7/26/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I think I might modify the inner plane native to separate out "echoes of the riving" (fey, elementals, dragons, giants at the moment), from "other" and then merge "corrupted, awakened, unusual" into "other" which is just everything else


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense to me


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
although actually corrupted I thought was a decent category on its own


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, right, good to keep that as well


[7/26/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
Mentally, it feels to me like the areas I'd be comfortable just randomly introducing something in game without some kind of pre-dicsussion (YMMV might be reasonably different than mine) would be 
(a) corrupted
(b) types of fey or elementals
(c) beasts
(d) magical creations
(e) children of creation
(f) abberations

But things that didn't fit in those categories I'd probably want a better story and compelling reason


[7/26/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Which is were in particular, I find the species guide useful. To define the types of things that are "common" vs "rare", in some sense


[7/26/2024 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is reasonable. i pushed an update that I think is clearer. will slightly tweak age of myth text, and then merge, later tonight

any thoughts about true names and the magic of names esp amongst the fey in taelgar?


[8/4/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
Not really a thing? Myth/culture but not very powerful? Some type of actual magic?


[8/12/2024 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i added images for the rest of Delwath's items, curious what you think/if there are any that don't work for you


[8/12/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
also not sure how I missed the question about true names / magic of names. don't really have thoughts other than kind of wanting to avoid layering too many things together. might make sense for dragons and/or fey? certainly seems kind of fey-ish to have names mean something...but no real strong feelings any way at the moment


[8/12/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
I like the Delwath items. The rod of the pact keeper is creepy but that seems reasonable given its origin


[8/12/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
On names, here is what I ended up telling my players...

That said, to expand on the "aliases and names thing"....

The actual biggest danger is not even the "alias/call me by" that Kiya is talking about, it is the innocent  but misleading question, i.e.

"Can I have your name?"

A trickster fey could certainly have magic about them that would mean answering that question with "Sure, my name is Robin" could be bad. Now the fey "has" your name - maybe that makes it easy for them to impersonate you - maybe it means all of a sudden you forget your name - etc.

But the trouble was not catching the precise wording.

Answering a question with "Call me by..." rather than "my name is" is a safety measure - if someone says

"Can I have your name" and you answer "Call me Robin" you haven't given away your name.
Secondarily, the point Kiya was making is also true. There is a degree to which certain curses, rituals, etc depend on knowledge about the person, and certainty is better than doubt.


[8/12/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
So announcing to a fey "I am Robin of Abenfyrd, born in 1699, member of the order of the chartiable wanderer, acting guard captain of Cleenseau" gives them more true things about you. Which can make certain types of magic easier.

Saying instead: "Call me Robin, lately from Abenfyrd, wanderer and defender of the lands north of the Enst" is a lot vaguer, and thus less powerful.

But also a lot of Sembarans would call some of this Tyrwinghan superstitution. The true nature of fey magic is mysterious and exactly what powers it none of you know

To add, as far as you know there is no "true name" magic. That is, it isn't like if someone knows your name is Robin or Celyn or whatever, they have a voodoo-doll power over you and somehow you have to hide your name. 

It is better to think of it as more along the lines of - the less well your fey adversary knows you, and the more obstacles or secondary interpretations you put in your words, the better.


[8/12/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
[ in my head, I was basically thinking I didn't want to introduce yet another type of magic, although if dragons or something ends up having the concept, fine, there is a lot of "as far as you knows" in the above. But I think fey have enough going on without introducing the idea of True Names or whatever. And that the vibe of "hiding who you are" is better than something about the specific name ]


[8/12/2024 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah this all makes sense to me from a fey angle. possibly dragons have some secret "magic language" where names matter more or something (a callback to 'true magic' from high school) but that is for later and I agree the fey vibe is more about knowledge of who you are then any specific words


[8/15/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
Do you know what happened to Cloudspinner and are keeping it secret for game/plot reasons or do you just not know?


[8/15/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
I'm potentially setting up my PCs to care a bit about her fate. Not that it will come up soon or anything but they might at some point want to do something like go haring off to try to save her.

(Given that I'm setting up Greymalkin as a refugee from Amberglow, and that they are all the kind of people who hear the words "good fey mysteriously imprisoned" and immediately think  "um, maybe we should free her")

I guess canonically they can't possibly free her because she isn't free in 1748.


[8/15/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes I know exactly what happened to her and can't tell you (yet)


[8/15/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
But you will almost certainly have more information before it becomes relevant in your game


[8/15/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Note that probably all Greymalkin would know is that Cloudspinner mysteriously vanished


[8/15/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the only way you learned she was imprisoned was the meta-narrative in the intro to the Amberglow / Caulaus session


[8/15/2024 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
right, that makes sense


[8/15/2024 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
how's this

"Seven hundred years ago, to the south, the Cloudspinner, Queen of Sunsets ruled the fey realm of Amberglow. How I wish I had seen it in those days. It is said to have been a land where the glorious colors of the evening sun turned the sky and the grass and the water and the rocks to ever-changing paintings." He stops and shrugs in a way that points at his bright coloring. "It was a place aflame with color and joy, I am told."

"But she vanished - to where, no one knows - and the land decayed. The colors seeped out of it, and darkness and danger moved in. But not all was lost, for in pockets and hidden crannies, those loyal to the Cloudspinner kept hope alive. I was born in one of those pockets, ~name tbd~, in the days before the Great War, about 200 years ago."


[8/15/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
haven't written more yet but the basic narrative is that about 100 years ago, this pocket of safety fell to Umbraeth


[8/15/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's about right, timing might be slightly off, the exact date of cloudspinners disapperance is sometime after 950 - when the orcs of the people of the rainbow started to leave amberglow and before 1059 - fall of drankor


[8/15/2024 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a random bit that I just made up without context about the resistance to the decay in the cloudspinner page you can steal from if you want


[8/15/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I was looking at that


[8/15/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus

not sure if you are still on Nantucket with your friends, but FWIW Nathaniel has been asking for a while to start a new family D&D campaign which we are finally doing soon, and I'm reviving Addermarch as the setting. Will probably be pushing some significant cleanup / updates over the next couple of days. when you have free time might be useful to chat a bit about relationships between Addermarch and Tyrwingha but no rush


[9/1/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
Still on Nantucket but happy to text about addermarch a bit. Only have my phone but‚Ä¶


[9/1/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
I have a few people from addermarch but haven‚Äôt developed it much. Figured it was somewhat more influenced by Tyrwingha than other places and the Darkwood is connected to Duskmire in some way


[9/1/2024 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
basically trying to work out a rough history. my recollection from the Duskmire history is that the Darkwood goes way back. there is a note suggesting that Umbraeth was exiled in the DR 600s, but not sure if that is strictly canonical


[9/1/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
but assuming that Darkwood is a dangerous place during the Drankorian expansion (timing is not perfect, but relatively close), Addermarch is probably a pretty marginal backwater during the Drankorian era


[9/1/2024 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm imagining the geography/climate as kind of mid-Atlantic Applachians. Addermarch itself is pretty hilly with difficult overland travel, except along the (few) navigable rivers / river valleys


[9/1/2024 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
so my basic history is that:
- pre-Drankor, Addermarch is settled by Tyrwinghans, but is always fairly marginal
- Drankor, it is a province of Drankor, but not a particularly important one. but crucially outside the deal with Ethlenn so more directly assimilated


[9/1/2024 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
have some forestry, and the Aure is navigable as far as Addermarch, so not a total economic dead zone. but not rich by any means.


[9/1/2024 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
in the Timeline of Sembaran history, Addermarch is noted to be established as the Earldom of Adderfell (presumably being called an Earldom due to cultural and historical connections to Tyrwingha) in lands formerly controlled by Avatus


[9/1/2024 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
here it seems like there are two possibilities, based on the geography that has Addermarch as kind of a pocket surrounded by hills on three sides (west, south, east):
- one option would be that this was an area that suffered from hobgoblin and other raids for a long time after the major defeats of Avataus, basically a backwater where many of the hobgoblins, etc, in Avatus army fled
- a different option would be actually this was never conquered, but was cut of from Sembara by Avatus, and so during the post plague years it was really functionally a part of Tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
in either case, it becomes part of the Sembaran crown during Derik I's rule, after the defeat of Avatus


[9/1/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm not convinced that Atavus stuff has to be canonical


[9/1/2024 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôve imagined the western and northern borders of addermarch to be pretty rough terrain


[9/1/2024 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
So it seems plausible it was never conquered and has an older history


[9/1/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, basic idea is that the western edge of the mostreve hills is a very rough, with a steep escarpment particularly on the west that borders the Gap of Maseau


[9/1/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
less rough to the northeast where the Aure flows towards the Enst, of course, and less rough towards Tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
The Tyrwinghan part of the mostreve hills I‚Äôve established as much denser in fey than elsewhere and not very settled but where settled very traditional


[9/1/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense


[9/1/2024 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
potentially Ethlenn's domain might extend southeast towards Orenlas, putting the Tyrwinghan Mostreve hills at the center


[9/1/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah maybe


[9/1/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think the settlement of addermarch was probably originally a bit complex - tyrwinghans but also clearly leaving Ethelenns domain


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right. it has many cultural similarities to Tyrwingha but doesn't have the same fey connection which has a big impact


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
potentially in part settled by Tyrwinghans who *didn't* want to be part of Ethlenn's bargain


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
It might have originally been something of a frontier perhaps even a place of exile / banishment from Tyrwingha. Somewhat dangerous and with fey in the Darkwood on the southern border


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
Right the rejection of the bargain could work as well


[9/1/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
post-Drankor, my image of the vibe is kind of like the Dendarii Mountains in the Miles books, although without the implication of technological backwardness and the kind of dumb hill people stereotypes


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but a rough place that was the center of guerilla fighting during several post-Drankor, pre-Great War wars (e.g., Avatus), but never conquered and proud of it


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
then, the same thing repeats during the hobgoblin wars. it is never conquered, but especially during the 3rd hobgoblin war it is completely isolated from Sembara


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I like that


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/1/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly there isn‚Äôt really any reason it ever has to have been part of sembara

It might work better if it was simply always an independent frontier type place


[9/1/2024 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's true


[9/1/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
A backwater Drankorian province in the hills that was mostly known for the Darkwood in the south


[9/1/2024 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
Avatus never conquerors it but probes and maybe does some damage/marches through


[9/1/2024 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
But during the Avatus-Great War period is closely aligned with sembara and there are lots of back and forth


[9/1/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Then during the more recent hobgoblin wars it becomes more isolated again


[9/1/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think that makes sense. it might have a similar history to e.g. Vostok, in that during the height of the power of the Deriks the earl of adderfell swears personal fealty to Derik (as an underking type thing)


[9/1/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but then post Great War it quickly departs the Sembaran orbit


[9/1/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
And in the last 150 years has developed kinda independently with a bit of a ‚Äúthese are our hills ‚Äú vibe


[9/1/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, especially until the final defeat of the hobgoblins in the 1650s it was repeatedly isolated from Sembara. and then even again e.g. during the undead crisis in your current campaign it would be the natural response of the people of Addermarch to retreat to the hills

Demonym
A demonym (; from Ancient Greek  Œ¥·øÜŒºŒøœÇ (d√™mos) 'people, tribe' and  ·ΩÑŒΩœÖŒºŒ± (√≥numa) 'name') or gentilic (from Latin  gentilis 'of a clan, or gens') is a word that identifies a group of people (inhabitants, residents, natives) in relation to a particular place. Demonyms are usually derived from the name of the place (hamlet, village, town, city, re...

anyway I think this basic history is logical, I'll probably push some updates tonight


[9/1/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
When are you setting this family game? 1740s?


[9/1/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
probaby, haven't decided


[9/1/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking also about titles and governance a bit, I'm leaning towards Addermarch retaining a system similar to Tyrwingha but without the fey influence. pre-Drankor, both Tyrwingha and Addermarch centralize power largely in the hands of the earls, a group of knights-errants basically, who answer to Ethlenn in Tyrwingha but perhaps to no central authority in Addermarch, or perhaps the earls elect one of their own to be overking.

during Drankorian rule, the earls are coopted by the Drankorian state in both places with a governor ruling, but in Addermarch -- which has a much more violent post-Drankor history -- you basically revert back to earls electing an overking after Drankor falls


[9/1/2024 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so it has a lot of cultural parallels with Tyrwingha but more of a rugged independent vibe and without the fey influence


[9/1/2024 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
on a related topic, do you have any names for political subunits of Tyrwingha? wondering if this should be English (e.g., shires) or more French, perhaps county


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm not sure there are political subunits


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think earls have circuits


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
But not fixed domains per se


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
but there are no layers between earls and individual manors?


[9/1/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
I don‚Äôt think so. Tyrwingha is physically fairly small


[9/1/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
Celyns village, which Kiya developed in a fair bit of detail, doesn‚Äôt have a lord of any sort except the earl


[9/1/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
It was left a little unclear whether sembara introduced the idea of manorial feudalism


[9/1/2024 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right. i guess addermarch doesn't have to follow precisely but perhaps there isn't much benefit to introducing another layer


[9/1/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
Or more specifically my view was something like‚Ä¶.

In traditional Tyrwingha there were earls who rode circuits and collected labor tithes from those on their circuits (and the earl and their household would basically live off the people and villages in their circuit)


[9/1/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
In northern Tyrwingha sembaran manorial feudalism starting to spread from sembara


[9/1/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
But I left it undeveloped how far jt had spread


[9/1/2024 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
One of the ideas is that in Tyrwingha the fey protect the people from the mysterious scary threats


[9/1/2024 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that makes sense


[9/1/2024 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
Whereas in sembara that‚Äôs the job of the manorial lord


[9/1/2024 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
addermarch has a lot of castles and forts that need to be supported


[9/1/2024 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
So there are less taxes and formal hierarchy in Tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
Addermarch on the other hand might have formalized a group of effectively castellans beneath the earls who control the defenses


[9/1/2024 8:58 PM] rsulfuratus
but i was imagining something that wasn't directly manorial feudalism, more like you have shires or counties or whatever that have a count or a baron or whatever, and then need to support defense via castles but the castles are generally occupied by a knight or a castellan who does not have any herditary claim on the land


[9/1/2024 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe you can cut out the count/baron whatever and just have the knights/castellans as vassals of the earls


[9/1/2024 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I‚Äôd do that. Addermarch is small. I think it‚Äôs smaller than Ireland for example


[9/1/2024 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
it is about 23,000 square miles, ireland is about 25,000


[9/1/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
It‚Äôs also a place that could be a bit random/not neat. Maybe there‚Äôs an uneven divide amongst the earls and the earl of the southern border has a couple of vassals between them and the knights


[9/1/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
Not necessarily of course but if it makes sense for a story/histody


[9/1/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
But I don‚Äôt think there should be a formalized subdivision like sembaran baronies

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/1/2024 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah there are also some not neat things like the lord of adderfell is considered an earl despite not riding a circuit and functioning basically like a manorial lord

[9/1/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Another thing to think about is the fey influence isn‚Äôt empty on addermarch - the southern part is part of the fey ‚Äúbelt‚Äù right? But these are duskmire fey or perhaps other domains not so safe/under control as Tyrwinghan fey.


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
So I kinda think addermarch should have more of a fey influence then say sembara ‚Ä¶ but in a more ‚Äúthey are dangerous‚Äù way


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
originally the idea was duskmire started in the region of the feywild colocated with darkwood


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
(and is the source of the "Darkwood" name)


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah

But that‚Äôs the southern border of addermarch right?


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yup


[9/1/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
I guess addermarch itself is under less clear fey influence


[9/1/2024 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
well, it is definitely a place where people worry about the fey


[9/1/2024 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but with almost the opposite vibes of tyrwingha

Right

Addermarch is roughly divided into four major geographic regions:
- To the west and northwest, the Maseau Escarpment is a region of rough hills and some mountains that borders the flat plains of the Maseau Gap. This is a hard land with few people. This area was extensively fortified at multiple times in the past, but the castles in the hills have not all been maintained and many are now in ruins. %% very mountainous, steep cliffs, maybe Provence-like? white mountains %%
- The center of the realm is the Aure river valley, a land of rolling hills, forests, and many rivers that cut through the hills. This region is the most densely settled, and includes Adderfell, the only real city in Addermarch. This is also the major agricultural land in Addermarch, and the center of brandy production. The Aure is navigable from Adderfell to the Enst, and many riverboats ply their trade along it. %% Shenandoah/Blue Hills, Susquehana river valley%%
- To the south and east of the Aure valley are several lines of wooded hills and mountains, rising gradually to the height of land on the eaves of the Darkwood. This region is well-guarded, and lightly populated, mostly with smallholds of foresters and furriers. %% also mid-Atlantic Appalachians but very wooded%%
- To the east and northeast, along the borders of Tyrwingha, the poor soil of the hilly, rocky land keeps forests to sheltered valleys. This is largely rangeland: sheep and cattle graze in the high pastures in summer, and only in a few sheltered valleys do crops survive. %% more open meadows, less forests, perhaps also a bit Provence-ish? %%


[9/1/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
What about the northern hills?


[9/1/2024 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
that is part of the Maseau Escarpment

I‚Äôd see the hills to the east more like the hills to the south


[9/1/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
I think the Tyrwinghan / adderfell border is thicker forested hills than what you have above?


[9/1/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I need to draw it out on a map and play a bit with it. i think I'm imagining that there are some higher mountains

not the border that runs north/south


[9/1/2024 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
Although maybe the forested slopes on the northern/eastern side give way to worse soil and rocky land on the west/south slopes


[9/1/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing I‚Äôve established is that the hills to the far east are pretty forested


[9/1/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
Also that the land between the mostreve hills and the enst is rocky with steep hills and forested valleys, but hard to navigate as it rises to the Appalachian-like peaks between adderfell  and the borderlands. Basically you wouldn‚Äôt go that way if you could help it versus down the Aure

on the very western edge it is very steep and drops to a flat(ish) plain at the "Gap of Maseau" but the north is broader and probably more mountains and less dramatic cliffs rising from a plain

btw at some point I'm thinking of making a vector-based world hex map to be a slightly better organized version of the "canonical map", probably using the Adventurer Conqueror King system (smallest unit is the 6 mile hex, which aggregate to 24 mile hexes), but then I'd likely add a rough 85 x 85 mile square (1 degree latitude) and a 425 mile square. so on the large map you'd have a 20x20 grid as the biggest aggregation, with each grid cell representing 5 degrees latitude, and breaking down into 25 smaller squares, with each smaller square containing ~12 big hexes

Two unrelated questions:
(2) how would elves think about war dead? would their be memorials? graves? seems like they would be treated differently than elves who leave when they want

Surprisngly, trying to work out answers as part of Colorado session prep


[9/2/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
On elven war dead, I think there would be some sense of lose, like they were artificially cut off from Adanor


[9/2/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
So a memorial might celebrate that connection and therefore be living?


[9/2/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah like the idea of something living. mostly want to check that it wouldn't seem weird for their to be elven memorials to the war dead, in the same sense it would be weird to have elven graveyards.


[9/2/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
The first thought that comes to mind is something like an elaborate and enormous flowering tree. I think the vibe would very much be about memorializing the connection to Aldanor. Perhaps even something spontaneous- like the elven forest expressing its own loss of these elves who were still entangled with the mortal world


[9/2/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm not sure elves would build memorials so much as tend to them


[9/2/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
One thought on addermarch - the history of 1720-1740 might be a bit hard to work out esp as it relates to Duskmire and the fey. I‚Äôm not sure if you are planning much fey involvement in the family campaign though


[9/2/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
Nathaniel wants to be a warlock with an archfey patron

Right, makes sense. There are a bunch of spaces for random minor fey lords along the sunset gate

not sure if you are interested in this, but with the new D&D rules now available I've been thinking a bit about updating the set of playable species in Taelgar, both to bring homebrew species up to the new design and to have a bit more principled set of playable species (motivated by the new family campaign I'm starting and Isaac's friends wanting to make new Taelgar characters for the semi-defunct Great Library campaign). 

thinking a little bit about it, my feelings are that there are really potentially four groups of species.

1. standard species are species that are widespread, deeply integrated into worldbuilding, and straightforwardly available as PC options (but they don't have to be common, e.g. elves). I'd consider these to be: human, elf, dwarf, lizardfolk, halfling, stoneborn, kenku, centaur at the moment but could move other species here possibly.

2. fey species are the large class of feywild natives that often find themselves on the material plane and would usually be viable PC options. These would include: satyr, "fae/fey" (which needs a little thought as to the generic "fey humanoid" species stat block), fairy (pixie/sprite), changelings, some kind of "beastfolk" options (e.g. haregon, owlin, tabaxi type species, but requires a bit of thought)

3. "unusual" species are species with well-established lore and integrated into worldbuilding but that have complications that prevent them from being a straightforward PC option. orc, hobgoblin, goblin, bugbear, kobold, merfolk, gnome are the most obvious ones here. maybe shifter to represent lycanthropes.

4. "rare" species are things that might be viable player options but are not integrated into worldbuilding. mostly things like the various "plane-touched" humans (aasimar, tiefling, genasi), or the dhampir/hexblood/reborn Ravenloft lineages, or the "underdark" species variants. maybe warforged


[9/4/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
my main interests at the moment are:
(1) solidify the set of standard species and homebrew new versions of them
(2) solidify the set of fey species but typically use published versions for them
(3) make some decisions about what rare/unusual species would not disrupt the Taelgar vibe to include


[9/4/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., Nathaniel originally wanted to play an orc, which I decided was too complicated for the game I want to run, but in principle I could see an orc PC as being kind of an interesting option in the right campaign


[9/4/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
but, again, not sure if you care too much


[9/4/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not massively interested in thinking about additional homebrew rules as my game probably has 2-3 years still to go and I have no plans to run anything small scale in Taelgar (i.e. if my game for Zachary's friends restarts, it would not be in Taelgar)


[9/4/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
My main interest would be impact on worldbuilding


[9/4/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
to the extent that there is any...


[9/4/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
My instinct in games I run is to wait to homebrew stuff until people want it, but I can see how that doesn't work as well for your kids/their friends


[9/4/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah it is particularly a challenge for Isaac's friends because they tend to be a lot more build-oriented than anyone else I run games for


[9/4/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
so they always want to see the traits/features before they decide what to do


[9/4/2024 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
In general, I think there is a benefit to "less is more" in this space though. D&D has way too many playable species


[9/4/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
even if they just rebuild their existing characters I need dwarf, lizardfolk, (some kind of fey) for them, plus halfling, elf, human for my family game, so that is nearly all the most common options anyway (except for stoneborn which no one ever seems to want to play)

yeah, i feel like there is a fair bit of tension between worldbuilding and what a lot of the people I run games for want here, so i'm trying to balance


[9/4/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
from a worldbuilding perspective adding more species gets to be quite annoying, so the humans + elder folk is a great setup


[9/4/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
and having diverse fey options seems like a good compromise to expand the playable species quite a bit with minimal worldbuilding impact


[9/4/2024 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
Yes, that makes a lot of sense to me


[9/4/2024 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
In particular, having a wide variety of fey species doesn't actually commit any of them to be "real species" with lore and stuff. There's no need for a defined community of taxabi to have a half-cat fey


[9/4/2024 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
right, exactly. it is the obvious solution to any kind of "beastfolk" build


[9/4/2024 10:35 AM] rsulfuratus
the big things I'm not sure about that could impact worldbuliding are:
(1) kobolds have always occupied a bit of weird place. i've used them a fair bit (mostly in the Great Library) campaign and they don't really work as a "typical evil" race (orcs, goblinoids). generally they've been regarded as a nuisance and sometimes a threat by humans nearby, but there is certainly room to expand kobold lore. adding kobolds to centaurs and kenku as "playable weird species not from the feywild" would give 9 species + fey options that feels pretty complete. 
(2) there are a large number of D&D species that are basically plane-touched humans. i don't want these to have big communities and have lots of lore, but i'm not sure whether or not it would matter to allow e.g.  one-off aasimars with unique backstories that are fundamentally "human".


[9/4/2024 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a place for kobolds as an interesting "other" species (to go along with kenku, merfolk, and centaurs in particular) and a "nuisance" but not "creation of the void mind" species seems like it could fill a niche


[9/4/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
As to (2), I think sensible having some one-off stuff (which, actually, kinda fits in the lore via a "magical soul", especially for tielflings or aasimar


[9/4/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
(and probably Gensasi as well)


[9/4/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
if it were me I don't think I'd let anything outside of assimar/gensai/tieflings in though


[9/4/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
for "plane touched" humans


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
Potential updated elf. Goal is to streamline a little bit (no need to repeat spell descriptions in the traits) and balance against PHB 2024 Elf. Could potentially use a couple more ritual choices, and the 5th level improvements for Elven Ritual Magic are maybe not strong/interesting enough.

### Elves

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: Your size is Medium.
**Speed**: 30 feet
**Age**: Elves do not die of old age, but during each cycle of the ka, the pull of the material world weakens for them. Few elves remain on Taelgar beyond their fifth ka (approximately 800 years).
**Languages**: Elves long lifespan means they typically learn more languages than usual. You may select up to two additional languages beyond the three languages that all characters start with. Should you wish, you can exchange one or both of these language proficiencies for tool proficiencies. 

As an Elf, you have these special traits.

**Darkvision**: You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

**Keen Senses**: You have proficiency in the Insight, Perception, or Survival skill. 

**Trance**: You don‚Äôt need to sleep, and magic can‚Äôt put you to sleep. You can finish a¬†Long Rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.

**Resilience of the Dream:** The connection to Elmerca and Aldanor that developed during the first years of your life has left you resilient to mental and physical tolls. You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed condition, you are unaffected by mundane diseases, and you have advantage on saving throws to avoid or end magical or unusual diseases.


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
**Firstborn Gift**: You have an innate understanding of the weave of magic from your connection to Elmerca, the Wild Star, and Aldanor, the Living Tree. You choose one of the following talents.
- *Elmerca's Gift*: You know the Prestidigitation cantrip. When you finish a long rest, you can replace that cantrip with a different cantrip from the Wizard spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this gift), and for you this cantrip requires only Verbal components. 
- *Aldanor's Gift*: Your Speed increases to 35 feet, and you learn the Druidcraft cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this gift), and for you this cantrip requires only Verbal components. 
- *Gift of the Sea:* You can breathe air and water, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you learn the Shape Water cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this gift), and for you this cantrip requires only Verbal components.


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
**Elven Ritual Magic**. Your innate connection to the weave of magic allows you to learn one spell from among the choices below. You always have this spell prepared, and you may cast this spell as a ritual, even if it does not have the ritual tag. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the spell). *When you reach character level 3,* you learn a second ritual from this trait. *When you reach character level 5,* your skill with ritual magic intensifies. Spells you cast with this trait do not require Concentration, have their duration tripled (if it is not Instantaneous), and can be cast with only a 1 minute ritual. 
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Protection.**_¬†You learn the Mage Armor spell. 
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Sight.**_¬†You learn the Detect Magic spell. 
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Knowledge.**_ You learn the Comprehend Languages spell. 
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Awareness.**_¬†You learn the Locate Animals or Plants spell. 
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Speech.**_¬†You learn the Speak with Animals spell. 
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Ward.**_¬†You learn the Alarm spell.

Its a decent upgrade in power that feels like it fits well with the lore

I like all the little bones you are tossing me üòÑ


[9/4/2024 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
(more languages, dropping concentration on detect magic)


[9/4/2024 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
also you can swap your Elmerca cantrip on long rest


[9/4/2024 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
how did you do the competency thing in D&D beyond for your game? since you can't homebrew languages I want to have a way to make it easy to know how many languages you should add to your sheet


[9/4/2024 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
No good way to do i in D&D Beyond that I found


[9/4/2024 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
I ended up switching to Dicecloud

In the Addermarch game, Nathaniel wants to be:
- A human noble from Sembara, from a very rich family
- The family has a secret connection to a fey cult of some kind
- The fey cult is associated with Lord Serenveil, Prince of the Vesperwind, Guardian of Twilight's Edge

Nathaniel wants the fey stuff to be kind of mysterious right now. I think probably Lord Serenveil makes the most sense as the lord of one of the border realms near the Sunset Gate, presumably in Sembara. Most likely this would be an associate of Ethlenn, but might make the fey stuff a little unclear as to motives (but can put that off for a while)

The rich Sembaran family with secret fey associations could be just something completely invented but if there is an obvious place for that would be interested in your opinion


[9/8/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm. Let me think for a minute.


[9/8/2024 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
Are you thinking 1740s or 1725 or what exactly?


[9/8/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't really settled on a time yet to be honest


[9/8/2024 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
kind of waiting to see what happens with the campaign


[9/8/2024 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but probably leaning towards mid/late 1720s


[9/8/2024 2:16 PM] .deciusmus
Right.


[9/8/2024 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
Ok. A few ideas


[9/8/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
The Asa family. Sarabeth Asa was a magic user of some kind (not defined what) who fought with Cece in the hobgoblin wars and was granted Asineau manor as a reward


[9/8/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
She disappeared into (presumably) the feywild in the 1670s, and her son went looking for her and vanished in the 1710s


[9/8/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Sarabeth‚Äôs wife could have been connected to a larger fey cult


[9/8/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Or Sarabeth could have been although the family is a bit far west


[9/8/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
But I have very little made up about her, maybe the Asa family is important in the borderlands somewhere


[9/8/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
Having her connected to a fey cult would explain why Umbraeth went after her (if that is what happened haven‚Äôt actually decided why she or her son disappeared)


[9/8/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
Where is Ainseau manor?


[9/8/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
Near Cleenseau


[9/8/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
But the Asa family is from Mosteve Hills


[9/8/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
Lady Sarabeth Asa. I think I've told you her story before? She was from a small village in the Mostreve Hills, near the source of the Clavert River, in the Barony of Brumecliff. When she was granted this manor, a number of refugees from her old village settled here, including my mother. We brought with us the memories of the Wyrdling, from our old village, and still remember their miracle here, each September.


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Doesn't seem to fit the "rich family" bill very well


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
True


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Another idea. Moreau family


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
They are the barons of fellburn


[9/8/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
Very little made up about them except there are twins- a brother and sister - the brother panicked during the undead attacks against fellburn and refused to help their father


[9/8/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
When he was trapped outside the walls


[9/8/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
The brother was then exiled and the sister made baron


[9/8/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Natheniel could be a cousin or something who has gone south trying to find the exiled brother


[9/8/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
(Or I guess he could even be the exiled brother if he wants, I had a name but it was a minor detail so doesn‚Äôt have to stick with that name)


[9/8/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
(The father died)


[9/8/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
the adventure motivation is that the fey cult send Nathaniel's character to Addermarch to find out more about this mysterious alchemist in the hills, who is going to be their patron


[9/8/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is probably easier not to have a family that is tied to events in your 1720 campaign, as it anchors things too much in time and nathaniel is much more vibes based than details based


[9/8/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
A third idea is the de Brune family. They are a wealthy merchant family with connections along the Enst


[9/8/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
I have two people in the Cleenseau region established but they could easily be spread along the whole Enst valley, they are established as having connections up and down the river.


[9/8/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that actually seems pretty ideal


[9/8/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
And actually the fey bad guys in my campaign are about to screw around with Sabine de Brune, the castellan of Valit, so having the family have a secret fey connection might be something id steal


[9/8/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
is eskbridge a manor? free town?


[9/8/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
Not decided


[9/8/2024 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be a good location for Nathaniel to be from, would be easy to have news of Addermarch there


[9/8/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
so thinking maybe the de Brune family has holdings there? would require they emerge from the whole lich thing well off as I'm definitely setting this game after the lich events


[9/8/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
but also could be a different branch of the family in eskbridge or something


[9/8/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
Having the de Brunes be a secret fey cult family based in near Eskbridge (perhaps with several small manors but not the lords of eskbridge itslf) and holdings along the Enst seems perfect


[9/8/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
Eskbridge itself is a relatively small town (2000-3000) and canonically the only bridge over the Enst other than Cleenseau


[9/8/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. my thinking is an entrepenurial family with holdings along the Enst in Eskbridge could also be fairly wealthy, and would have reason to care about interests upriver in Addermarch, so the fey cult sending a younger son to investigate something would be perfect


[9/8/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
And there were some undead attacks on it and in 1720 the tyrwinghans are massing on the border but it‚Äôs been relatively unscathed and is off the main plot


[9/8/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/8/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Catherine de Brune in Cleenseau has been established as one of the wealthier people in the region (Cleenseau)


[9/8/2024 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
okay perfect. not going to develop too much of this yet until i have a better sense of how much detail Nathaniel cares about but will start from here


[9/8/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
fey patron for both Nathaniel and the family cult, is Lord Serenveil, Prince of the Vesperwind, Guardian of Twilight's Edge.

A tall, towering figure, long flowing silver hair, dark skin, dressed in robes that shift colors between deep purples, dusky blues, and silvery grays. Fiery eyes, like fading sunset.


[9/8/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
no details yet exist, but the vibe is likely an ally/lieutenant of Ethlenn guarding the sunset gate


[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
Presumably even if not a direct lieutenant it would be safe to assume he might have been used as conduit between Ethlenn and my PCs? Specifically I‚Äôve had a few hints dropped here and there that there is a fey creature in the Cleenseau region who has been occasionally dropping hints to Celyn about danger- but in a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want anyone to know I‚Äôm here‚Äù kind of way


[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, sure


[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm wondering if these fey are messengers/servants of Lord Serenveil being sheltered by the be Brunes

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
Probably just one actually


[9/8/2024 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Nathaniel likes the kind of mysterious / not clearly the "good guys" vibe so might have Serenveil be a bit more complicated than just "lieutenant of Ethlenn" but definitely he would not be allies with Umbraeth. might have his own agenda but be independently wary of Umbraeth for example


[9/8/2024 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
and of course would not be in conflict with Ethlenn


[9/8/2024 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah sure


[9/10/2024 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
started to push a bunch of addermarch stuff, fyi


[9/10/2024 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
some stuff still in stub/draft form


[9/10/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
did you ever make any sort of map


[9/10/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a hex map that is kind of half done


[9/10/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i do intend to finish it but got kind of busy at work


[9/10/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
which river is the umber


[9/10/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
Aure - main river that runs from Darkwood north past Adderfell
~ East Aure Fork ~ - the river that joins Aure from the east, just north of Adderfell
~ Main Aure Fork ~ - the river that joins Aure from the west, a bit north of Adderfell
- Umber - the river that joins the Main Aure Fork furthest west


[9/10/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
don't have the other branch (that joins Main Aure Fork between Umber and Adderfell confluence) in notes yet


[9/10/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure best way to comment, but here are a few on the Mostreve Hills:

I'm not totally sure I understand the geography.


Is your view that the four regions you have are basically what I've labeld 1/2/3/4 here:

I was confused because you had "NORTH" of Latazaro swamp, took me a minute to figure out you meant south (I'm fixing)


[9/10/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
how hilly is the darkwood? is it split by the hills, or kinda more inside the "bowl"?


[9/10/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
more inside the bowl imo


[9/10/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
although also it is clearly along a watershed divide


[9/10/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think the highest ground actually runs kind of along the edge of the rivers just below 2


[9/10/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
right. maybe westcliff is more like a sideways T


[9/10/2024 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
or I guess not quite, but the land of the Darkwood itself is hilly to the west and north, less so to the south and east


[9/10/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Westcliff is kind of a big C marked in brown, with the very steep sections the two parallel lines due west

maybe swapping 4 and 3


[9/10/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
or anyway 4 and 3 are pretty close. 5 is noticably less high than 3/4

[9/10/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so you have in the "East Aure Fork" highlands a fair bit of bare, open ground and some alpine meadows, while in 5 ("Tyrwingha borderlands") you have more rolling hills largely forested at the summits


[9/10/2024 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
(but some of this is driven by poor soil in the 3/4 area as these are not quite as tall and definitely not as steep as 1)


[9/10/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
Geographically, the Mostreve Hills are composed of five distinct ridgelines:
* The [[Westcliff]] ridge runs in a truncated north-south 'C', on the western edge of the Mostreve Hills, with the highest and steepest parts of the ridge along the western edge, bordering the [[Maseau Gap]]. The highest peaks of the Mostreve Hills are here, especially along the western escarpment. 
* The ~Unnamed Aure Headwaters Ridge~ runs mostly east-west, arising from the rolling hills of the [[Aure]] river valley some 50 miles east of the Westcliff ridge, and cutting in a south-south-easterly line towards the headwaters of the [[~Aure East Fork~]]. This ridgeline partially separates [[Addermarch]] from the [[Darkwood]]. 
* The ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~, which runs in a north-easterly line, starting north of the [[~Aure East Fork~]]
* The ~North Tyrwinghan Ridge~ which is east of the Aure, and runs in a series of lines running north-west from the Tyrwinghan ridge. These peaks are notably gentler than the other ridges, and form less of a barrier to travel.
* The ~Orlenas Ridge~, which starts south of the [[Latazaro]] swamp and runs almost due east until it grows in the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]]


[9/10/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
In between these ridgelines are several major gaps:
* The [[Aure]] river cuts between the Westcliff and Tyrwinghan ridges, in a broad and relatively fertile river valley
* The Darkwood creeps north between the Westcliff ridge and the ~Unnamed Aure Headwaters Ridge~, forming a hilly wildland on the southern borders of [[Addermarch]]
* (Something between the Aure Headwaters Ridge and the Tyrwinghan Ridge, on the map at least it looks like it should be a hilly gap, although not sure what is here)
* Between the ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~ and the ~Orlenas Ridge~ the land is hilly but there are few high ridgelines, and multiple passes cut through the Mostreve HIlls immediately northwest of [[Orenlas]].


[9/10/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure if the ridges would actually be named, although historically in i.e. the applachian mts everything is (Blue Ridge, Smokies, WHite Mts, Green Mts, Berkshires, Poconos, etc)

A few other random thoughts... 

(a) the lower Aure is somewhat unclear. Is it unsettled (if so, why)? If not (on the map it is mostly Tyrwinghan, I guess), what is the transition between Addermarch and Tyrwingha? Is there a formal border? A geographic feature

(b) the upper "Aure East Fork" also seems a bit unclear. It is hilly and impassible? Too dangerous for settlement? Too close to elves?


[9/10/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is basically right. A few small details / additions:
- The Aure Headwaters Ridge increases in height as you move to the southeast, and the soil gets poorer, so e.g. near the Aure headwaters you have the creeping edge of the Darkwood (which I think the Addermarians would see really as something that is invading their country and needs to be cut back), but by the southeastern end (headwaters of river that heads south to plaguelands) this is dry, marginal land with bad soil and can't support much in the way of forests
- The  Tyrwingan Ridge I think runs the same way in reverse, steepest/highest/worst land on the southwest end, getting better as you move north/east towards Tyrwingha
- The "East Aure River Valley" is a gap between the Aure Headers and Tyrwingan Ridge, which is not forested except in pockets, and is generally poor soil and pastureland, but supports a lot of sheep and cows potentially


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Re questions:
(a) there probably needs to be a border between Tyrwingha and Addermarch along the lower Aure. I don't think Addermarch extends all the way to the Enst


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right, agree with that, but not clear why a border. Maybe just the edge of Ethlenn's claim


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
?


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
that is probably the most obvious answer


[9/10/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
It might also make sense to run a small river from approximately "5" on the map above to the Aure, to form a border


[9/10/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
or I guess somewhere between 4 & 5


[9/10/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
i think also this is an area where there isn't a clear sense of physical borders. before drankor anyway everyone owed allegiance to an earl but they don't have physical lines, in that a village to earl A coudl be surrounded by a vilalge to earl B in theory


[9/10/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
at some point Tyrwingha probably reshuffles things (during Drankor negotiations?) so that only Ethlenn's claim is separate from Drankor


[9/10/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but no reason there needs to be a physical feature to define a border here


[9/10/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Maybe there is an ancient line of Drankorian/fey border stones


[9/10/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would be interesting


[9/10/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like that better than a river


[9/10/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the addermarch border to the north runs along the line of the cliffs (where there really isnt a border since no one lives on the very summits), and on the west side of the Aure the cliff line basically meets the river, anything north of that is "not Addermarch" but might be either Tyrwingha or Sembaran borderlands


[9/10/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
on the east of the Aure, the border with Tyrwingha is marked by ancient stones from Drankorian era with fey markings


[9/10/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
something like the blue lines

[9/10/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I was envisioning stones that went from the Aure to peak along ridge. Sorta where the blue line is but maybe a little bit south, i.e. just straighter east


[9/10/2024 6:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that works too


[9/10/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
The Tyrwinghan border, is basically then: the coast/Aure/line of markers/not defined because no one lives in the southern parts of the Tyrwinghan ridge


[9/10/2024 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus

[9/10/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
basically this:

where the yellow highlight is tyrwinghan border, the red x's is the fey/drankorian marker line, and the blue scribble is a height of land

[9/10/2024 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[9/10/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
so the "tyrwinghan" ridge region doesn't have "borders", it is just unsettled land between tyrwinghan and addermarch


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not totally clear on what the forset just south of the hills is though


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
that is plaguelands


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
ah. I didn't realize the stretched so far north


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
so is that river / lake all plaguelands, basically (west of Orenlas)?


[9/10/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the rivers that join just north of the big southern lake delimit the kind of outer edge of the influence of Orenlas


[9/10/2024 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
although none of this is technically canon. in the defunct Plaguelands campaign the Cinder Court (which was the main enemy) was going to be based in the forests between Orenlas and Addermarch

[9/10/2024 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
hard to read, but trying to say the far west blue circle is darkwood. the yellow line is about Orenlas? But the other 2 big blue circles.. are you saying those are plagueland? Or just "hrm bad stuff no people who knows what bad stuff"?


[9/10/2024 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the lower left "?" is, IMO, kinda "Darkwood++"


[9/10/2024 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
the Darkwood in my mind has this kind of "evil fey" vibe of always trying to press in and grow into the human kingdoms

this doesn't have to be canon, but:

[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
but maybe twilight's grace doesn't so quite so far south and/or the taelgar/feywild mapping isn't perfect or something


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah exactly so the lower left ? is matching up perfectly with Duskmire


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
I think that's clearly Darkwood/Darkwood++


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
Twilight's Grace borders though should be adjusted to not cover addermarch


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and match the Drankorian border stones


[9/10/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/10/2024 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd move "3" down to fill it, but it also sets up Addermarch as kind of a battleground state in the feywild


[9/10/2024 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
and 3 here - covering Fellburn and Eskbridge - is potentially the domain of Nathaniel's patron and the de Brune family secret fey


[9/10/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
"3" is the "mostly Ethlenn aligned border small fey kingdoms"


[9/10/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
so fits the de Brune secret fey perfectly, although I think maybe it is a unsettled place without a clear single "master archfey domain"


[9/10/2024 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[9/10/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
Still open question what is between Tyrwinghan and Orenlas


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
which relates to Addermarch in the sense of ... why havent they expanded up the Aure East Fork valley


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
what makes that southeastern border a border?


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
in my mind, the mountains are much rougher and steeper than indicated on the world map


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[9/10/2024 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I think if you look at the topography as implied by watersheds instead of the drawn hills


[9/10/2024 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
so you really have high ridges like:

{Attachments}

[9/10/2024 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think that is more accurate


[9/10/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
then what is the woods northeast of darkwood and west of orenlas is an open question but definitely not "human civilization"


[9/10/2024 6:25 PM] .deciusmus
I like that, lessens the need to define what is south of the hills


[9/10/2024 6:26 PM] .deciusmus
So basically, in my "five ridgelines" the big change is really that the "Aure Headwaters Ridge" runs all the way east until it connects with the Tyrwinghan Ridge


[9/10/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
and probably that area - where the ridges intersect - is the highest and roughest terrain east of Westcliff

### Borders

To the west and northwest Addermarch is bordered by the [[Westcliff]], a series of sharp cliffs and dangerous terrain that separates the realm from the flat plains of the [[Duchy of Maseau]] to the west, and the [[Borderlands|Sembaran borderlands]] to the north. At the Aure, the high ridge of [[Westcliff]] is cut by the river, and on the eastern bank, the land is much lower. Here an ancient line of border stones running to [[~High Peak of Tyrwinghan Ridge~]] demarcates the border with [[Tyrwingha]]. These stones are said by some to be raised by Drankor, but they are marked with complex warnings in [[Sylvan Writing|Sylvan]], and many believe they have fey origins.

The eastern border is not marked, as the high terrain between Addermarch and Tyrwinghan is unpopulated. The gentler, forested slopes to the north and east are under the demense of Tyrwinghan earls, and the dryer, arid slopes to the south and west, the land of Addermarian earls.

To the south, Addermarch is bordered by the high ridge of the [[Mostreve Hills]], where the headwaters of the [[~Aure East Fork~]] flow, and then, to the southwest, the [[Darkwood]]. This border is carefully watched for fear of what might creep out in the shadows.

that's fine


[9/11/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure if you have thought much or care much about mechanical details of taelgar species, but i've been trying to rework at least the five core firstborn species a little to better capture mechanically the "unique firstborn magic" of each species. feeling pretty good about elves (ritual magic), halflings (telepathy/ancestral memory); have good ideas for lizardfolk (various prophecy/dreamworld things). stoneborn are a little unsettled because the lore is not totally clear but thinking around body transformation/resilience, things that have a vibe of like 'anime monk stuff' a little bit (this is how they are basically written now). 

dwarves are the biggest challenge. the current runic magic is, I feel, too complicated and a bit overworked (a species really doesn't need 10 options to pick from), and mechanically feel like a pretty mixed bag. 

the lore, however, i think is pretty clear, it just doesn't translate well mechanically. i have two ideas neither of which i love:

(1) make dwarven rune magic explicitly about creating an item, kind of like artificer infusions. i kind of tried to write it this way once but no one who has played a dwarf seems too interested in engaging with this

(2) make runes function kind of like origin feats, kind of modeled on feat chains from the giant sourcebook (Bigby's), which would give you kind of an alternate runic progression, but could be a lot of work to design


[9/11/2024 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
I like the basic vibe of inscribing a rune, but the current set of options is a bit complex


[9/11/2024 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
And the fact that each rune has its own set of rules and reset options makes it feel especially more complex


[9/11/2024 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
If I were trying to simplify, I think I'd 

(a) keep the basic idea of a rune you inscribe
(b) each rune would grant  one ability, approximately like a first level spell to the bearer, and the rune's magic always fades after it is used (some would in fact be 1st level spells, but some might be spell-like abilities)
(c) at 3rd level, gain the ability to mirror the rune, so when you inscribe it you keep an echo of it, allowing both you and someone else to gain the ability


[9/11/2024 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
that's a starting point... maybe needs a different 3rd level option, and a 5th level option


[9/11/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
And perhaps dwarves are then also missing a feature, i.e. if you compare to your new elf, we have

Darkvision = darkvision
Dwarven training = keen sense
stonecunning ~= resilience of dream + trance

But the rune magic above is about the same as the ritual magic of elves, so dwarves probably need something extra (esp as speed 25 feet is a penalty)


[9/11/2024 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, that is I think a useful perspective. i kind of like the style of a "firstborn gift" choice + a "firstborn magic" choice + basic species traits, so that might suggest revising dwarves to be:

darkvision (I think perhaps buffed to 120 feet as the only underground playable species in taelgar)
stonecunning
some kind of baharazel gift (that might subsume dwarven training, and would include cantrip options which don't fit well in the runic magic idea)
rune magic that is simplified and streamlined


[9/11/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Right that pattern works well in general, I think.


[9/11/2024 3:51 PM] .deciusmus
Gift of Azar's Valor: Advantage on saving throws against fright.
Gift of Maganna's Radiance. You learn the Light cantrip.
Gift of Tarbaka's Cunning. You gain proficiency in 3 tools
Gift of Azar's Training. You gain proficiency in two martial weapons, or shields.

Just ideas but they seem relatively easy to generate (2 per baharal is probably too many though)


[9/11/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I think one per Baharazel would make sense


[9/11/2024 3:53 PM] .deciusmus
Runes are a little bit harder as the set of good 1st level spells isn't massive they should probably mostly not be combat spells, and you already used a lot for elven magic and lots of overlap seems boring


[9/11/2024 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
for runes it might be worth doing a little more inventing of non-spell effects


[9/11/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
although some initial ideas, keeping to the existing runes:

Rune of Defense: Protection from Good and Evil
Rune of Delving: Find Traps
Rune of Exploration: Longstrider
Rune of Lore: Identify
Rune of Valor: Heroism


[9/11/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Rune of Stone: A reskinned Locate Object that works on ore/stone/etc only ("Locate Stone or Ore")


[9/11/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Rune of Life:  Goodberry


[9/11/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
Rune of Truth: A limited form of Zone of Truth?


[9/11/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
This list doesn't have Aid or the Forge. Unseen Servant for something maybe? Purify Food and Drink?


[9/11/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
Not committed to any of the above, but it doesn't seem that hard to come up with a decent list


[9/11/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think this is probably the right direction. am going to fiddle a bit but i think the design is probably something like:
- Baharazel's Blessing (which is aimed to be roughly 1/2 as strong as an origin feat, so kind of on par with e.g. Firstborn's Gift + keen sense from elves)
- Tremorsense, improved darkvision, 30 foot speed as "main basic features"
- Rune magic which is designed to be a little weaker than Elven magic. probably something like one choice of spell or spell like effect, can use prof/2 times per day, but never learn a second effect


[9/11/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
**Bahrazel's Blessing.** Your innate connection to the Bahrazel provides you with a supernatural blessing. Choose one of the following options: 
- *Tarbaka's Blessing of Craft.* You learn the Mending cantrip. In addition, you have an uncanny ability to understand raw materials and how to shape them. You gain proficiency in two Artisan's Tool of your choice. When you Craft items with your chosen Tool, you require only half the time and raw materials that would normally be required.
- *Maganna's Blessing of Elements.* You learn two cantrips from among Light, Elementalism, Gust, Shape Water, Control Fire, and Mold Earth.
- *Azar's Blessing of Strength.* Your Hit Point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level. 
- *Oshkir's Blessing of Life.* You learn the Guidance and Spare the Dying cantrips. 
- *Uzdan's Blessing of *
- *Karthel's Blessing of *
- *Fanrukel's Blessing of *


[9/11/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
Is Maganna really related to elements? Does that fit the lore?


[9/11/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
not really but i kinda want an elemental option on there since Mold Earth has been so central to Seeker


[9/11/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
and Riswynn has Shape Water from her dwarf background


[9/11/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe that should be Karthel (runecrafter)?


[9/11/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, that might work better


[9/11/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
- *Fanrukel's Blessing of Shaping.* You learn two cantrips from among Elementalism, Shape Water, Mold Earth, Gust, Control Flames, or Light.


[9/11/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
possibly adding Thaumatury as an option as well. It is most of the non-combat Transmutation cantrips, plus Light


[9/11/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
oops meant Karthel


[9/11/2024 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Maganna's Blessing of Communication. You learn the Message cantrip, and in addition you gain proficiency in 3 additional languages.


[9/11/2024 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
that's good


[9/11/2024 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
Izgil (the dwarf in my game) uses this ability not infrequently:

When the bearer of the rune makes a ability check that uses the Arcana, History, or Religion skills (or related Knowledge competencies), and rolls a 9 or lower on the d20, they can activate this rune to treat the number rolled as a 10. Once this effect is activated, it cannot be used until the rune is inscribed again. The number of uses increases to two at 5th level and three at 11th level.


[9/11/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably a better fit for a rune than a gift though, if I was trying to keep it


[9/11/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that could be the basis of a decent rune


[9/11/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
Eric also uses Seeker's sense ore a reasonable amount, which could also be a good rune


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
right; the real issue for Izgil is that he also uses Identify from his rune a fair bit, so hard to make an exact equivalent (i.e. because it might make sense to have 2 runes one for identify, one for a "ability check take 10" - but neither of those are a great fit for a gift, and I'm not sure if he'd want to trade)


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
well if you did update to new rules, the solution would be to get Identify from your origin feat


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
you mean via magic initiate or whatever


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus

[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[9/11/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually I'm wondering if the knowledge thing might work as Fanrukel's Blessing of Lore


[9/11/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
It feels maybe a little powerful to have an infinite set of uses


[9/11/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah you'd either need to limit to one skill and lower the floor to 8, or give it limited uses i think


[9/11/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually since Identify is a ritual spell, it is not unreasonable to have unlimited uses of that


[9/11/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
that might be a better Fanrukel's Blessing of Lore actually


[9/11/2024 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
That's true


[9/11/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
it is slightly duplicative of the vibe of elven ritual magic but i think reasonable in this case


[9/11/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
identify definitely is an dwarven-associated spell by vibes


[9/11/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think one case where you have a ritual is fine here


[9/11/2024 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
If you are doing rules stuff would it make sense to push it in the ‚Äúplaying species‚Äù mechanics rather than only D&D beyond? Easier to read/edit that way


[9/11/2024 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
just pushed. i don't have the finished species in obsidian (although could add them)


[9/11/2024 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
Campaigns/Mechanics/Species of Taelgar.md


[9/11/2024 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
Don‚Äôt see it


[9/11/2024 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
oops forgot to push


[9/11/2024 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
done now


[9/11/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
added halfling and elf, which are more or less done on d&d beyond as well


[9/12/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i pushed updated versions of dwarf and lizardfolk (Campaigns/Mechanics/Playing a ....), and some comments on design decisions. might work a little bit on stoneborn if i have time while i'm eating lunch. will be teaching from 1:30 pm - 5 pm so won't be able to discuss anything this afternoon


[9/12/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
(elf and halfling also there but not updated from the versions on d&d beyond)


[9/12/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
A few thoughts on Dwarves:

Binthuhr dwarves: I think they should get an origin feat + bonus skill prof. Just origin feat seems weak. (Although maybe from a lore perspective binthuhr dwarves should be weaker?)

Blessings:
a) Maganna's Blessing of Communication. The change-language-on-long-rest feels good and interesting. I'd keep it.

b) Uzdan's Blessing of Leadership. Fine for now. I do think something that isn't just a worse musician or worse inspiring leader would be better. I prefer this to a temp HP as from a flavor perspective "musician" is very specific


[9/12/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Binthuhr, the logic is 120 feet darkvision is as good as a skill proficiency, so compared to humans they are fairly balanced. but also i don't really expect anyone to play one so i'm not sure how much it really matters. the main goal is to make them not feel obviously stronger than regular dwarves


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I guess it depends on whether human heroic inspiration is really balanced against stonecunning or not


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I guess slightly weaker than human is fine though


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I don't have strong feelings


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
And I can see how origin feat + skill might make them seem arguably stronger, which is bad


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
So you are probably right


[9/12/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah humans are fairly strong as it is so slightly weaker is not bad imo, the main goal is if Isaac is reading the new dwarf his first thought is not "why i am i bothering with a thuhr?"




[9/12/2024 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Isaac will almost certainly pick that for his Taelgar dwarf so planning on just seeing if 10 minutes feels too weak, that is best to just playtest imo


[9/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
what about:

#### Tarbaka's Flame Ward
**Casting Time:**¬†1 Action
**Range:**¬†Self
**Components:**¬†V, S, M
**Duration:**¬†1 hour

One of your appendages becomes immune to fire damage. While this effect is active, you can use your Reaction when you take Fire damage to gain resistance to the triggering damage. The first melee attack you make on your next turn that hits does an additional 1d6 fire damage.

When you use your Reaction in this way, the Flame Ward ends.


[9/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
Basically Absorb Elements but with a long term secondary effect


[9/12/2024 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that actually, gives it a bit more utility if you want to hop through lava or something


[9/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
(and actually absorb elements gives you resistance to all damage of the trggering type until the start of your next turn)


[9/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
(which I'd keep)


[9/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
So basically... 1 hour duration for the "appendage immunity" plus a one-time usage of absorb elements (fire). 

Feels balanced (it is basically mechanically similar to just being able to cast absorb elements) but with a nice fun rider effect


[9/12/2024 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
now teaching so offline for 3 hours


[9/13/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
I was messing around with a D&D 2024 version of Delwath a bit... D&D Beyond is tough to use as I can't select old-school invocations like Ghostly Gaze


[9/13/2024 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
But... broadly, I'd be tempted (assuming I do this when going to level 12 warlock)
(a) rearrange stats slightly to drop WIS to 10
(b) which lets me boost starting CHA to 17
(c) which means I can get to 20 via ASI @ 4th and War Caster @ 8th (which now gives a +1 to CHA)
(d) which means my 8 invocations are:
- Pact of the Blade
- Thirsting + Devouring Blade
- Ghostly Gaze
- Eye of the Rune Keeper (so weak they removed it, but important for flavor)
- 3 others TBD

That drops Eldritch Mind (which is replaced with War Caster) and Improved Pact Weapon (which I might add back in)


[9/13/2024 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
Ideas:
Ascendant Step (Levitate @ will)
Devil's Sight
Master of Myriad Forms
Visions of Distant Realms
Lifedrinker (but I don't really like the flavor)


[9/13/2024 9:58 AM] .deciusmus
or adding back in Improved Pact Weapon, although mechanically it kinda boring in that it is just effectively a +1 to hit/damage


[9/13/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
there is a lot that is still a little buggy about the 2024 D&D Beyond implementation, but hopefully a lot of these will be fixed by the time it officially releases on 9/17 (so before Colorado)


[9/13/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
(e.g. selecting older invocations)


[9/13/2024 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
yeah less worried about the actual implementation than just playing around with possibilities


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
I assume you'd have no objection to tweaking stats (the fact that War Caster gives +1 CHA now makes it a lot more compelling than Eldritch Mind)


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that's fine


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
are you planning on taking metamagic adept at 12?


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/13/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
4th level is ASI, 8th War Caster, 12th Metamagic Adept


[9/13/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
nets a +3 CHA, so then tweak starting stats to have 17 CHA (15 from point buy + 2 from background) to keep CHA 20 @ 8th level


[9/13/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
but that means dropping WIS or INT to 10 from 12


[9/13/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
then the main changes would be:
* Origin Feat (not thought about it yet)
* between 2 and 4 invocations


[9/13/2024 11:07 AM] .deciusmus
(where 2 would be if I kept Improved Pact Weapon + Eye of Rune Keeper; 4 would be if I replaced Eye of Rune Keeper with Comprehend Languages and also dropped Improved Pact Weapon)


[9/13/2024 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
I think spells are the same (other than being able to change Green Flame Blade to something actually useful, although I *almost* used it against the minions in the battle with the vine)


[9/13/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
I would argue you should keep Eye of the Rune Keeper for story reasons, but dropping Improved Pact Weapon certainly makes sense if there is something more interesting


[9/13/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
Delwath has been using Alter Self a lot, so Master of Myriad Forms might be a thematic and useful choice


[9/13/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
that would also free up a spell known


[9/13/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
Would you consider an upgrade to Eye of the Rune Keeper to be

Senses of the Rune Keeper
You can understand the literal meaning of any language you hear or see signed, and the literal meaning of any writing you see.


[9/13/2024 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
(Basically Comprehend Language @ will, without the limit of "touching the writing"


[9/13/2024 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
Given most invocations are non-ritual spells at will, it doesn't seem overpowered


[9/13/2024 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus
(on a meeting, more later)


[9/13/2024 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
I think I'd be tempted by Ascendant Step (basically to save on Fly casting for simple things like drifting to the ground from Vdrinjashra or not having to climb) and Master of Myriad Forms.

Then still need to think about Improved Pact Weapon


[9/13/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
okay a few thoughts:

(1) On Rune Keeper: for Delwath, I don't think it really matters at all one way or the other, since of course the situations where (a) you want to understand what someone is saying, and (b) you can't spare a spell slot to cast Tongues are exceedingly rare, and anyway Kenzo can already understand all languages. 
But, in general, I'm not a big fan of "understand all language all the time" as a invocation, it feels like it really cuts off a good chunk of using language as a meaningful mechanical barrier. I'm actually not a fan of the decision in the new PHB to just collapse everything into "just Ritual cast it", e.g. I think that the Beast Speech and the Eldritch Sight invocations are interesting and still useful.


[9/13/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) On other invocations: completely fine with any of those choices.


[9/13/2024 12:39 PM] .deciusmus
On Eyes of the Rune Keeper, mostly it is just substantially weaker than Comprehend Languages. So in many ways I'm not sure it is really interesting given Comprehend Languages is very easy to get


[9/13/2024 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
(and there is a bit of a "keeping up with the jones" effect for Delwath specifically, where it feels odd that as the one with massive Charisma / party face role he is substantially behind Kenzo in the "understand what you are saying" department)


[9/13/2024 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
well, that depends on whether the 'takes 10 minutes to cast' and 'have to touch writing' are meaningful or not


[9/13/2024 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, from a invocation standpoint, an invocation that lets you cast a first level spell at will is pretty standard


[9/13/2024 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
so it isn't even ritual cast, so much as just "cast without a spell slot"


[9/13/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
from the point of view of delwath, as I said, I don't think it really matters


[9/13/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm just not convinced from a game design perspective that having a low-level invocation that lets you understand all spoken and writing language at will is something i would want to homebrew


[9/13/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
From a balance standpoint, if I were designing an invocation that let you cast a 1st level spell, that was already a ritual, at will, I'd make it a little better than the spell is my only point.


[9/13/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
as it trivializes language choice


[9/13/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
Isn't language choice already trivialized by the existence of Comprehend Languages at some level?


[9/13/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
There are a bunch of other ways to "trivialize" language choice, i.e. Magic Initiate or Ritual Caster, they all require choosing to do so


[9/13/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
a little, but to me it feels different to have an ability that says "you just understand everything" as opposed to having a spell you can cast


[9/13/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
to me, ritual casting Comprehend Languages is rarely, if ever, useful for the spoken word part


[9/13/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
I guess. I think the game effect of the difference is fairly minimal.


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
Really? There are lots of situations where you know you are going into a social situation and in most games taking 10 min to ritual cast before you do is pretty easy to do


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. the main circumstance you'd want to understand language but not speak it is when you are eavesdropping or similar, and typically you wouldn't have 10 minutes to ritual cast


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but comprehend doesn't let you speak, just understand


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
sure, but that is still useful in any social situation, i.e. where the other people might talk in their own language


[9/13/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
I think D&D already has a mechanical issue with languages because they are binary


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess it is just my dmign style, i can't think of a time i've had npcs have a side conversation in a different language, but i do sometimes have enemies yell to each in other in combat


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
*side conversation during a social situation


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
The giants


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
but Delwath had already cast tongues


[9/13/2024 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[9/13/2024 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
Plus some stuff in Ursk where casting a spell wasn't possible


[9/13/2024 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, i don't think it matter for delwath and it is perfectly reasonable for delwath to just understand all languages


[9/13/2024 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
Scrying is another scenario


[9/13/2024 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right but when you are scrying there is basically no situation in which you can't just cast tongues


[9/13/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
Its a big tax on slots to have to cast tongues


[9/13/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, realistically, I guess it rarely matters. But I'm always nervous to burn 2 slots in that type of situation


[9/13/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
(and back when I only had 2 slots and was spamming scrys, a ritual comprehend is much better use of time than scry + tongues)


[9/13/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
My point is actually just a philosophical one, which is that from a pure in world usefulness perspective, I don't really think "read all writing without touching it" necessarily would win over "cast comprehend languages as written as a ritual"


[9/13/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i think what i would actually do if I were homebrewing this from first principles is leave eyes of the rune keeper as a 2+ level invocation, and then make a new higher level invocation that is you can understand all spoken or written language


[9/13/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
See from a pure homebrew balance perspective I think it doesn't work once warlocks have access to ritual spells


[9/13/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps you'd make eyes of the rune keeper be: "You always have the Comprehend Languages spell prepared. In addition, you can read all writing/"


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
That is closer to balanced


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe not worth taking? i'm not sure. i mean, delwath took eyes of the rune keeper a while ago and i think got a fair bit of value out of it


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
of course 2024 warlocks couldn't ritual cast and had much more limited slots...


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but Delwath had no option to take Comprehend Languages


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
and no option to ritual cast


[9/13/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
*2014 warlocks


[9/13/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
If I could have just learned Comprehend Language as a spell and been able to ritual cast? I'm not sure Eyes of the Rune Keeper is worth it over some other invocation


[9/13/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
For example, if it was a choice between Comprehend Languages as a known spel + Alter Self at will, vs Alter Self as a known spell + Eyes of the Rune Keeper it isn't even a close decision


[9/13/2024 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
sure. i mean in 2014 alter self at will was 15+ level. there is a lot of power creep in the 2024 warlock, more than many other classes


[9/13/2024 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus
which i have mixed feelings about because I think some of the lower-power invocations mechanically are very flavorful (also see the doesn't need to sleep one), but the more powerful invocations become the more feel-bad it is to take those


[9/13/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
what would be more flavorful imo is scaling invocations, or at least "low level" and "high level" versions. e.g., at 3rd level or whatever, "read all writing" isn't necessarily a bad choice. by 5th level, you probably want it to be stronger, and by 12th level definitely. 

but you could do something like:
(no level req): read all writing
(requires 5th level): understand all written, spoken, signed language
(requiress 11th level): understand all written, spoken, signed language. cast tongues at will. 
(requires 17th level): understand and speak any written, spoken, signed language. you can use spell scrolls of any class.


[9/13/2024 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, not sure any of this really matters for delwath specifically, who i think should just get a homebrew invocation


[9/13/2024 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
sure, although if you are offering up "cast tongues at will" for I wouldn't say no


[9/14/2024 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
what do you think of this? 

Uzdan's Blessing of Leadership. When you finish a [rule]Long Rest[/rule], you can inspire bravery in yourself and your allies. Choose a number of creatures up to your Proficiency Bonus. Each target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Proficiency Bonus. While a character has these Temporary Hit Points, they are immune to the [condition]Frightened[/condition].


[9/14/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
This is supposed to be about 1/2 a origin feat?


[9/14/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
Inspiring Leader feat is character level not prof bonus temp HP... I think this is balanced on its own, in a way, but it seems unfortunate it doesn't synergize with inspiring leader feat. It feels like a character who wants this kind of thing might want to take both, but they kinda clash


[9/14/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
about to go out for a bit, but yeah, it is tough to get something satisfying because temp hp effects all clash with each other. 

and it is hard to think of other good effects that have the flavor of "inspiring allies" and aren't too complicated

the other option I thought about was just a "fear resistance aura" - you have advantage on saves against being Frightened, as do all allies within 30 feet of you or something. not tied to rest, just always-on


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
is there anything canonical about when Umbreath established Duskmire? in the Duskmire note you have in the 600s but is that set in stone? 

i'm dropping a warning stone in the next adventure for my Addermarch campaign that is near a place of easy travel (not quite a portal, but a place where fey can cross to the material plane with less effort)


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to figure out what language the warning signs might be in


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing canonical.


[9/16/2024 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
But it has to be before Cloudspinner was imprisoned


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i was more wondering about pushing it back a bit. 600s would be when Drankor had already established in Addermarch


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
say to 200 or 300


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
For the expansion narrative to work. Could be much older though. Who knows how long Umbraeth was hanging out in the Darkwood


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so by the time Drankorians arrive, the Ethlenn/Umbaeth split has already happened


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that probably works


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realm in the Cleenseau folder has a few hints


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
will take a look


[9/16/2024 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
But something like 250-300 would work fine.


[9/16/2024 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
I think


[9/16/2024 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
on a totally separate D&D topic - I realized recently when talking to Isaac that Epic Boons just have a character level 19 requirement, so you can technically take them at any level that gives you a feat as long as you are character level 19. 

so theoretically if Delwath were willing to give up 9th level spells, you could take an epic boon at both warlock 16/sorcerer 3, and warlock 16/sorcerer 4


[9/16/2024 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
(which would also give you 22 Cha)


[9/16/2024 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
Also means giving up a 4th pact magic slot


[9/16/2024 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
ah that's true. that might be worth more than the 1/day 9th level spell


[9/16/2024 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
I mean it will be a while. Would take sor 4 before level 20 anyway. So can wait and see


[9/16/2024 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
true


[9/18/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
I'm doing a little notes cleanup and just reading some random scattered things...

For something like the winter market for halflings in Adderfell (which would tie in nicely to Viatela (which doesn't have a good note, itself, but..)

What's the best way to suggest something like that? Change the text and tag status/tim? Just chat in discord?


[9/19/2024 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I've been super busy at work - just looking at D&D now. I think add a comment to the note and tag status/tim, possibly also mention on Discord


[9/19/2024 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
btw, I'm working on updating homebrew subclasses to 2024 rules. one clear design trend (which I don't feel completely obligated to stick) is to limit the accessibility of half-caster-exclusive spells. hexblade by default has a lot of paladin smite spells on its expanded list. other than banishing smite, delwath almost never uses any of them, so i am considering replacements, maybe just keeping 2 smites (banishing + one other)


[9/19/2024 11:03 PM] .deciusmus
It is mechanically useful to have a non-concentration smite in addition to banishing but 3 smites is probably excessive


[9/19/2024 11:04 PM] .deciusmus
It might be nice to homebrew a themed smite or two


[9/19/2024 11:07 PM] .deciusmus
Yalik'i‚Äôs smite of frost 
1d8 cold damage/level
Save or restrained (or maybe just zero speed or reduced speed) until end of next turn


[9/19/2024 11:09 PM] .deciusmus
Blinding smite could be
Nishir‚Äôs smite of the talons
(Effect like poking at eyes?)


[9/20/2024 12:01 AM] rsulfuratus
here is my current list. struggling with level 3; a homebrew smite could work there (although you could also just take the eldritch smite invocation for a non-concentration, non-bonus-action smite).

1st level: sleep (theme connection: moonlight, evening, night); shield (theme connection: hunter)
2nd level: invisibility (theme connection: sneaking up on prey), Mind Spike (theme connection: tracking, hunter **not sure about this one**)
3rd level: Fly? Conjure Animals? Spirit Shroud? Blinding Smite? surprisingly few hunter/moon/night/sleep/forest associated 3rd level spells
4th level: Fount of Moonlight (theme: moonlight, hunter; mechanically similar to spirit shroud - could drop this for spirit shroud at 3rd), Hallucinatory Terrain (theme: camouflage for the hunt)
5th level: Banishing Smite (theme: hunter), Dream (theme: sleep - scrying is also potentially thematic, of course doesn't matter for delwath since you use both of those spells a lot)

Some of the stuff on the current list (enthrall, tongues, ice storm) I can't figure out what the rationale was. 

Open to suggestions especially for 3rd and possibly something better than Mind Spike for 2nd. Or something else for 4th to replace Fount of Moonlight, and then would be easy to add Spirit Shroud to 3rd.


[9/20/2024 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
recalling that I think we had decided the flavor of the subclass was "Meswati" not just Yezali, rethinking spells a bit:

level 1: shield (yezali); sleep (midri, hibernation)
level 2: invisibility (yezali, tracking/sneaking up on prey); alter self or spider climb or ?? (k'onisati, transformation)
level 3: ??? (yezali - maybe spirit shroud if replace 4th level yezali option), tongues (taraka, communication/stories)
level 4: fount of moonlight (yezali), ice storm (yalik'i)
level 5: banishing smite (yezali), scrying (nisir)

possible alternative spells for each tanshi:
yalik'i: detect thoughts (2nd - the "listen everywhere" and "clear thoughts" vibes), calm emotions (2nd - also "clear thoughts" theme), rime's binding ice (2nd), cone of cold (5th), armor of agathys (1st)
k'onisati: polymorph (4th, transformation), giant insect (4th, *although the new version of this spell has some broken interactions), fly (3rd, insect/transformation), longstrider (1st), jump (1st)
nisir: arcane eye (4th), see invisibility (2nd)

tongues seems obvious for taraka
for yezali lots of alternatives even avoiding smites 

happy to take your suggestions just wasn't sure why we picked some of the old spells, and kind of feel like additional smites beyond banishing are kind of unneeded (another concentration option probably rarely gets used; blinding could be a 3rd level non-concentration option although if you have a spare invocation eldritch smite is much better since it doesn't take a bonus action and you can stack it with banishing smite)


[9/20/2024 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
The current structure has a Yezali themed spell each level, plus a 2nd one from a different tanshi.

So that comes out as:

1st Level: Shield (Yezali) / Sleep (Midri, hiberation)
2nd Level: Shining Smite (Yezali) / Enthrall (K'onisati / shimmering/distraction of butterflies)
3rd Level: Blinding Smite / Tongues (taraka/stories)
4th Level: Shadow of Moil / Ice Storm (yaliki)
5th Level: Banishing Smite / SCryhing (Nisir)


[9/20/2024 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
I actually like all 5 of the non-Yezali ones and don't see any reason to change them


[9/20/2024 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
I am planning on taking alter self at will as an invocation, so having it as a spell is very meh. Spider climb is fine-ish, but I actually used Enthrall at least once in game, so I'd rather not arbirtarily take it away


[9/20/2024 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
For the Yezali spells on the other hand, happy to move away from "all smites" if you are feeling like they should be more restricted.


[9/20/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
Happy to swap Fount of Moonlight for Spirit Shroud, Fount of Moonlight is better for sure than Shadow of Moil themeatically, and functionally close enough toSpirit shroud that it doesn't matter


[9/20/2024 1:23 PM] .deciusmus
Also have no particular attachment to Blinding Smite; although a 3rd level Yezali spell is not obvious to me... some ideas:
Conjure Animals seems like a good fit. Other ideas:
Haste (kinda powerful)
A reskinned Hunger of Hadar (to be something like attacking vines or beasts?)
Lighting Arrow is an interesting one (although Ranger-only, maybe you are trying to avoid that)
Nondetection (i.e. hiding vibe). Maybe overly useful? I would cast it all the time.

Alternatively, go with Spirit Shroud for 3rd and then 4th Yezali... ideas:

Conjure Woodland Creature (maybe with a type other than fey?)
Dominate Beast
Faithful Hound (although I can't tell if it is meant to be able to follow you around or just sit in a single spot. less useful if it just sits somewhere)
Freedom of Movement


[9/20/2024 1:24 PM] .deciusmus
On 2nd level, Shining Smite is, I believe, literally the only way the party has to deal with invisible foes. Kinda a shame to lose it, although Invisiblity is of course a very useful spell


[9/20/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
completely happy to leave all the non-yezali ones, if you are happy with them. had just forgotten the thematics we had worked out


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
re: invisible, sickening radiance also prevents invisibility, no?


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
yes of course


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
forgot that


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in fact you've relied on that feature at least a few times.


[9/20/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
that's more delwath's style anyway


[9/20/2024 1:50 PM] rsulfuratus
i thought about conjure animals but as an area effect concentration i wasn't sure if you would likely ever cast it over sickening radiance so not sure if it would feel kind of wasted


[9/20/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess the advantage of Conjure Animals is you can move it around when you move


[9/20/2024 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
the most thematic seems to me either:
shield / invisibility / conjure animals / fount of moonlight / banishing smite
shield / invisibility / spirit shroud / dominate beast/ banishing smite


[9/20/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
meswati patron and tanshi champion should work now on the 2024 warlock if you want to mess around. went with conjure animals + fount of moonlight but can change.

elves also work so should be set if you want to rebuild delwath


[9/20/2024 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
let me know if there are any issues you find (besides taking old invocations, which will need some kind of workaround for)


[9/20/2024 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the sorcerer bonus spells are drop downs in the character creator - default would be sanctuary and lesser restoration at 3rd. i think by the rules you could have 2 additional cleric spells besides those two.


[9/20/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Am I supposed to have 2 Elven Rituals?


[9/20/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes


[9/20/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
D&D Beyond is really bad.


[9/20/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
If you don't pick one of the "standard" backgrounds there is no way to add ability scores or origin feat


[9/20/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
The Origin Feats list is honestly a bit weak as well


[9/20/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
should be a  Custom 2024 Background option


[9/20/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
then you pick ability scores on the Ability Score page


[9/20/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
ah, I didn't look down to homebrew


[9/20/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Can I take the following origin feat:

Quartermaster

You gain proficiency with Cook's Tools and Tinker's Tools (or maybe just Cook's Tools).

Nourishing Meal. As you finish a Short or Long Rest, provided you have access to food or water, you prepare a nourishing meal and give Heroic Inspiration to allies who partake of the food. The number of allies you can affect in this way equals your Proficiency Bonus


[9/20/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
It's just Musician but reflavored to make sense for Delwath


[9/20/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
that's fine. i think just cook's tools though


[9/20/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
this should work: https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/1811993-camp-cook


[9/20/2024 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
this might also work: https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/414186-quartermaster


[9/20/2024 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
background works; doesn't let me pick stats though


[9/20/2024 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
have to manually add +s on the ability page


[9/20/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
ah i know why. i can fix that easily, i just need to add it as an option to the homebrew species.


[9/20/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
if you use a homebrew background + an official species you get the ASI choice on the abilities page, but it is because it is secretly coded in the species logic


[9/20/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
I assume if I'm tinkering I should go with Warlock 12 rather than Warlock 11


[9/20/2024 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/20/2024 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
wow sorcerers get a lot more spells


[9/20/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/20/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i think i fixed the elf ASI, although there are a few formatting quirks i haven't figured out yet


[9/20/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
so I net out with 4 spells to pick

I swapped Elementalism for Green Flame Blade and Sorcerous Burst for Booming Blade


[9/20/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
Invocations are a bit broken as I can't take the 2014 ones  - Ghostly Gaze in particular. Are you home brewing a better Eyes of the Rune Keeper?


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't think there is a straightforward way to homebrew invocations in D&D Beyond, and haven't thought about this much yet


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
The easiest way to do it is probably just leave the invocation blank and homebrew a feat


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
and then add a custom feat


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
ah yeah that probably works fine. does the eldritch adept feat let you take old invocations?


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
yes, I think so


[9/20/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
sort of


[9/20/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
it does let you take the old ones, but it doesn't realize Delwath is a "warlock" so it doesn't let you pick the ones that had pre-requisites


[9/20/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
so I can't actually pick Ghostly Gaze


[9/20/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
can pick Eyes of the Rune Keeper


[9/20/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
also can't add it more than once


[9/20/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
so it is of limited use


[9/20/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
the not repeatable would be easy to fix by just cloning the feat as a homebrew feat with a different name but the prerequistes are probably hard coded


[9/20/2024 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So basically I have a new Delwath but still need:
(a) to pick a handful of spells that ended up as new spells, either from invocations (Alter Self), new patron spells (Invisibility, Fount of Moonlight) or just sorcerers getting more spells
(b) figure out invocations. Definitely taking Alter Self at will. Keeping Pact of Blade + the 2 extra attack ones and Ghostly Gaze. Dropping Eldritch Mind as I took War Caster instead. 

That leaves 3 remaining slots.

**Slot 1: Eye of Rune Keeper.**
 But I really think you should home brew it to be something better because the Elven Ritual feat gives me Comprehend Languages with a 3 hour duration and a 1 minute ritual, so pretty easy to just constantly cast it. 

I am happy to pay a plot tax and keep it, but it would really make more sense to drop Eye of the Rune Keeper for something better and get by on the elven comprehend from a game mechanics standpoint, esp because none of the other elven ritual spells feel that sensible (mage armor silly, alarm silly given I have it already, and the animal vibe doesn't feel quite right for delwath)


[9/20/2024 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
**Slot 2: Improved Pact Weapon or ??**
Improved Pact Weapon is not that useful as it functionally just gives a +1. That isn't nothing, but might not be worth a slot. Eldritch Smite for example might be better.


[9/20/2024 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
Or Life Drinker, although the vibe is a bit eh


[9/20/2024 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of was thinking Eldritch Smite fulfills the desire for a non-concentration smite when designing the patron spell list, which only has banishing. so i think if you do want the non-concentration smite option then you should take Eldritch Smite


[9/20/2024 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
definitely the vibe on Eldritch Smite feels more Delwath-y than lifedrinker


[9/20/2024 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
Then for Slot 3, something random and not weapon related for sure. Probably one of
* Devil's Sight
* Ascendant Step (levitate at will)
* Visions of Distant Realms


[9/20/2024 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, that makes sense. Am leaning towards Edritch Smite not Imporved Pact or Lifedrinker


[9/20/2024 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
the other option is Pact of the Tome + Gift of the Protectors


[9/20/2024 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
Tome by itself is a bit meh. But Death Ward 1/day on 5 people is rather good


[9/20/2024 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
true. the tome doesn't have quite the right vibe, but reskinned as some kind of tanish ritual item it works well actually


[9/20/2024 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
but Delwath is very full up on cantrips


[9/20/2024 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, you really have little need of more cantrips. so you are basically paying 2 invocation slots for the gift of the protectors


[9/20/2024 5:23 PM] .deciusmus
I mean Unseen Servant and Tensors Floating Disk could be fun ritual spells


[9/20/2024 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that I am kind of not interested in trying to homebrew an eyes of the runekeeper alternative, but also don't think there is any reason you need to pay a story tax to keep it. you can always just imagine you swapped it out at the current level up


[9/20/2024 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
that said the downside to comprehend languages is you can't read writing in the mirror. not sure if that has ever come up. i think wellby lipreading comes up more


[9/20/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
It probably has a few times, I can't remember


[9/20/2024 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
At some level, I don't actually have a ton of invocations I want


[9/20/2024 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so, i think what i'll do is homebrew a ghostly gaze feat when i get a chance, and then if you decide to keep eyes of runekeeper you can do it via the eldritch adept feat. 

if you decide to take improved pact weapon instead of eldritch smite i can homebrew that too

i think anything else should be fine to just pick


[9/20/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
I do feel like the eyes of the rune keeper thing is annoying because ultimately, from a game perspective, having writing come up in the mirror that we can't read is going to feel crappy. But mechanically you are effectively giving me comprehend language for free


[9/20/2024 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
via the elven thing


[9/20/2024 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
So basically, eyes of the rune keeper is effectively the "you can use comprehend languages on writing you can't touch"


[9/20/2024 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
which is a pretty crappy invocation. but I'm hesistant to drop it, because if I do, and writing comes up in the mirror or something, I'm going to be annoyed


[9/20/2024 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
i do get that, although on the other hand you are getting a ton of new stuff already. let me think about it a bit


[9/20/2024 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
Nathaniel just texted me to ask who umbraeth is


[9/20/2024 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah we just finished a session and they met a naiad who mentioned umbreath


[9/20/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
he is really leaning into the secret fey connectin of the de brune family


[9/20/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
I told him Umbraeth was better known as the Gloomshaper and is dangerous and too stay away.  And it wasn't safe to talk. And to ask the Squire of the Whispering Wind about Umbraeth


[9/20/2024 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
he's sitting next to me


[9/20/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[9/20/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
what did the naiad tell them about umbraeth


[9/20/2024 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
just that his duskhounds sometimes ride through the darkwood, and to be careful


[9/20/2024 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm looking.... (nathaniel)


[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus

[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah they aren't going to the darkwood anytime soon


[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus

[9/21/2024 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
thinking a lilttle more about rune keeper / comprehend languages / etc.

i think one reasonable point is that if you are going to get a pick 2 choice from elven ritual magic, it would probably be nice to have a couple more options. this would be easy to add, but i'm having trouble coming up with interesting rituals (or ritual-esque spells, generally non-ritual spells that have a long duration without a benefit to spamming them). 

the other point is that delwath is probably getting the biggest power spike of anyone in the party with the switch (kenzo is close or possibly greater in combat, but delwath gets a lot of new spells, even compared to the playtest, and especially given the rebalancing of a lot of at-will invocations). so is it really that important to squeeze the most value out of every last choice? 

finally, i basically have just today to get the entire colorado adventure written, so i don't really feel like i have a lot of spare bandwidth for extra homebrew.


[9/21/2024 9:18 AM] rsulfuratus
so let me propose this:

if you come up with a couple more options for elven ritual magic that seem  elf-appropriate, i'm absolutely happy to add those elf, and you can take that instead of comprehend languages, and continue to live with rune keeper + tongues

otherwise i just don't really have the bandwidth to homebrew different invocations so kind of feel like you just have to decide whether wasting an invocation slot for the option to read writing you can't touch is worthwhile


[9/21/2024 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
For elves...

Elmerca's Insight: Augury (or does that step on lizardfolk toes?)
Aldanor's Purity: Purify Food and Drink
Aldanor's Aide: Unseen Servant (not sure about that one)

Still trying to think of one more for Elmerca. Skywrite maybe but seems a little powerful.


[9/21/2024 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
There are so few ritual spells that it is hard to come up with much


[9/21/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah this was my problem. was feeling like maybe needed to invent a few equivalent-power rituals to fill things out. 

was trying to avoid augury (lizardfolk) and identify (dwarf)


[9/21/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe not committed to last one


[9/21/2024 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus

As far as the rest of it, though, I actually _like_ Comprehend Languages as a elven ritual for Delwath. It fits into his backstory pretty well, and if we were replaying the game with these rules from the start I absolutely would have taken it at 3rd level.

I actually don't even really need another invocation, to be honest. The extra spells are a huge power boost, esp with the revamped patron spells (which frees up even more slots). And just going to 12th level is a big step up as extra metamagic is useful. 

But it just feels crappy to end up with a functionality pointless invocation, even though actually from a overall character perspective having 7 instead of 8 invocations is still mostly a step up.

Partly also the invocations in 2024 are just better; so the opportunity cost feels higher. When I took Rune of Eye Keeper not a lot of the other invocations seemed that appealing, either because I didn't have the levels or because they were tied to Eldritch Blast or very "pact with the devil warlock" vibe-y.

I'm not really looking for a proper "homebrewed" invocation in the sense of something that has well-thought out balance and that you'd publish in D&D Beyond, I'd just like something to make Eyes of the Rune Keeper not feel totally pointless (esp because I feel like Delwath is much closer to Elmerca than Aldanor, and in-game elven comprehend languages really makes the most sense).

My idea was something like: You can understand all spoken or signed languages and read all writing. 

Basically an always on comprehend + existing eye of rune keeper. Mechanically not that different than just casting the spell every 3 hours, but it can't be dispelled, isn't a spell so i.e. could have used it in Ursk, etc.


[9/21/2024 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
but from a power-perspective I'm happy to agree to also take the comprehend language ritual, so mechanically it isn't that different. I don't need even more slots.


[9/21/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm, i guess i misunderstood a bit. if you want to (a) take comprehend languages elven ritual, and (b) take eyes of the rune keeper, but also (c) handwave that the combination of the two means that comprehend languages is always activate as a "eyes of the rune keeper" effect instead of a spell, that is totally fine by me


[9/21/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
i thought the problem was spending two character options for the same thing


[9/21/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
but if you are fine spending two character options for the same thing then it seems reasonable to make them synergistic not conflicting


[9/21/2024 11:02 AM] .deciusmus
It is more that I have so many character options that I don't mind spending 2 of them for the same thing


[9/21/2024 11:02 AM] .deciusmus
As long as there is some kind of synergistic benefit even if just handwaved


[9/21/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
okay if that's the case then i'd say that while it still might be useful to have say 1 more elmerca and 1 more aldanor elven ritual option if you are feeling inspired, for delwath i'd just set it up as comprehend + eyes and handwave the synergistic interaction


[9/21/2024 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
it would effectively be like homebrewing eyes of the rune keeper to be an invocation that says: you can read all writing. also if you know the comprehend languages spell, it is always active for you


[9/21/2024 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
with the not actually a spell caveat


[9/21/2024 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
(although not clear to me that elven ritual magic itself is actually a spell in the first place)


[9/21/2024 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
any more than e.g. you could "dispel" the gift of the firstborn and change aldanor elves speed to 30 feet


[9/21/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
Do you remember if there is a way to do up until dates?


[9/21/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
I'm fixing the page for the Army of the South, which was basically disbanded and reformed during my current campaign. I was thinking of writing two descriptions, one for "dates before 1721" and one for "dates after 1721" but I'm not sure if we have a way to do that?


[9/21/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I semi-implmeneted this but not sure I ever tested it


[9/21/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
if the date ends with a letter, it theoretically parses it


[9/21/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
"b" is the default before behavior


[9/21/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
For now I am just writing the 1720 version in a date block and leaving a %% note %% for what happens post.


[9/21/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
"a" strips the comment if the current date is after the date in the comment


[9/21/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., "%%^Date:1725a%%" should remove the text between that and the end block if the current date for the vault export is after 1725


[9/21/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
but, it might not work because I don't think I ever tested it against anything


[9/21/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
oh huh actually Arryn III has an "a" tag


[9/21/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but it doesn't work because my taelgarverse tag has both versions: https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/arryn-iii/


[9/21/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
so consider it an unimplemented feature


[9/21/2024 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
I'm amusing myself by trying to clean up the unknown status tags. 

I know we've talked about status tags a lot, but two things...

(a) I'm adding status/needswork to stubs that clearly need more info. For example the page for Vimfrost. There is clearly a lot of world information about him, so just filling in the header to have some bio details isn't sufficient.

(b) I'm struggling a bit with the best tag for something that just needs rethinking. i.e. the page for Devils. It reads as basically complete, as far as it goes, but given all the recent discussions aorund metaphysicals of souls and the history of humanity it isn't clear the old info is necssary accurate. Is status/update the right tag for that? Or should we have something like status/needswork/rethink?


[9/21/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I've been using status/update specifically for notes that have been affected by recent campaign events. e.g. I think Milo and Tilly might have those


[9/21/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I think status/needswork/rethink would be fine, or just base status/needswork


[9/21/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I would prefer to keep update specifically to "campaign events have affected this" instead of "not sure this is canon" to have a clear way to say "the stuff on this page in complete but might specifically be out-of-date"


[9/21/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
right makes sense


[9/21/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
I think I'll use status/needswork/rethink


[9/21/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
There is a category of page that's kinda  hard to place..


[9/21/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
I guess more accurately I need a status for "I don't know the status, Tim needs to decide it"


[9/21/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
what's wrong with status/tim?


[9/21/2024 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I can do that


[9/21/2024 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
There are a lot of pages like say Adamanatine, which is set status/stub


[9/21/2024 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
But that's wrong, the page already has a complete header


[9/21/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
If it was a page I had created, I'd write a sentence about adamantine and call it done, but I don't know if you have deeper thoughts/interestes in the background of adamantine or not


[9/21/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
But I can just set status/tim on those easily enough that probably works


[9/21/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
some of those might be old tags - originally status/stub meant "nothing exists yet" rather than "needs a header"

there is also a category of notes that are kind of markers for things that definitely exist in the world, but that i'm not sure what else to say about them


[9/21/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that's part of what I'm trying to clean up


[9/21/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it is useful for status/stub to mean "needs header and basic one-two sentences" a


[9/21/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so for adamantine - all we know about it (unless there is more that has come up in your game) is that the dwarves near Raven's Hold used to mine it before the great war,  it can be used to make high-quality armor, and it somehow is useful to stabilize or channel or otherwise construct magic items


[9/21/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
For me, things that definitely exist but I am not sure what to say I either set
(a) status/needswork/blankslate, if I feel like the thing/place/person is very important and kinda needs to have info made up before it could be used
(b) no status, if the thing/place/person is background-y and not critical, and I don't really know if/when more info would be useful


[9/21/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
(I agree about status/stub, btw)


[9/21/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. Embry and Tafolwern gets status/needswork/blankslate - I'd definitely need to do prep for them before anyone shows up
But something like the Semb river doesn't *need* anything other than a sentence describing where it is. Maybe some color details are nice, but it isn't important. So no need to add the needswork tag


[9/21/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that makes sense


[9/21/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
But for some pages, I don't know whether in your mind it is more a "blank slate" kind of a thing or a "its done with 1 sentence" kind of thing


[9/21/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
But I'm just going to tag those status/tim with a note on why


[9/21/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's fine


[9/21/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
in some cases there are things that could become a big important thing if i found a reason for it, or could just be meaningless background if it never comes up


[9/21/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
but i guess that is kind of by definition not "blankslate"


[9/21/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
Right, for those I think leaving empty status is best


[9/21/2024 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
I am also doing a lot of "dump notes from discord into %% on the page and set status/needswork/internal


[9/21/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is very useful


[9/21/2024 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
the goal here is that in theory, if someone was feeling like "working on taelgar" but didn't have a specific goal, then in theory one thing you could do would be to just pick a random page with status/needswork/internal and rewrite it


[9/21/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
In theory, status/needswork/wip should probably also be accompanied by either status/mike or status/tim and would mean "someone has thoughts/details/in game plans" for this page, don't invent stuff without discussing with them first

whereas status/needswork/external would typically mean "we discussed this in email or discord but the notes are not on this page"


[9/21/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
status/needswork/external i also use for things that haven't been ported over from OneNote, but i guess generally that should ideally get a comment indicating the external source is onenote so you don't try to find the relevant emails (although usually pretty obvious)


[9/21/2024 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing that could also be useful - given that my family addermarch game is a lot more likely to overlap with sembara than any of the other things i'm running - is a good way to tag whether there are critical details to reuse a thing that are missing. i guess status/needswork/wip is maybe enough?


[9/21/2024 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but, for example, Eskbridge is currently tagged just as [place]. but the note is pretty thin. it isn't clear if there is relevant detail that would need to be incorporated if, for example, Nathaniel's character ends up going back home for an adventure


[9/21/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
I think  in general

status/needswork/internal should mean "note is not in good shape, but all the canonical info is somewhere in the shared obsidian repo"
status/needswork/external with no other tag means "note not in good shape, discussion happened in discord or email, but it is shared"
status/needswork/blankslate OR alternatively, no status tag means "no ideas really, invent away"
status/needswork/wip should always have a status/mike or status/tim and the status tag refers to the person who has the ideas


[9/21/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
status/needswork/external with a status/mike or status/tim means "I have details in private/unshared" notes. This is loose. Would sometimes not happen but ideally there would be a %% comment although realistically mostly we know who has the notes for external tags


[9/21/2024 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
status/update means "game events have impacted this but are not on the page"
status/needswork/rethink means "this page probably needs discussion or reconsideration" based on changes elsewhere


[9/21/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
I was also thinking it might be good to have something like

status/active/clee or status/active/addermarch or status/active/dufr

but especially for clee and addermarch

as a way of flagging characters that are active and important and might change from session to session vs more background stuff


[9/21/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
makes sharing easier


[9/21/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
there are also a handful of other status tags I've used. e.g. header for notes that just need to clean up header information, usually whereabouts, or refactor for notes with kind of complicated metadata that should probably be organized differently (usually for notes that refer to a specific example of an item that is not unique)


[9/21/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I like status/active as a general tagging concept as well


[9/21/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, we probably don't need to bother even with the campaign or other details. But I would find it useful to tell between "background npc" and "important part of addermarch" and it would probably be helpful for you as well with reusing my sembara stuff


[9/21/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
right, i think probably it is pretty obvious with status/active in what sense it is active


[9/21/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
Right this makes sense.


[9/21/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
So for example, my page for Areschera, one a shapeshifting fey villian in the current adventure for Cleenseau, I've changed from just status/stub to

---
tags: [person, status/active, status/stub, status/needswork/wip, status/mike]
---


[9/21/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
if I get around to typing up what I know, I'd change to just status/active


[9/21/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense


[9/21/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
whereas Ascombe, a small village my PCs visited, is

---
tags: [status/stub, status/needswork/wip, status/mike, place]
---
    

but if I wrote up what I know, I'd just change to [place] as it was just a waypoint and you could steal if if say you needed a place for a forester to be from in southern Sembara easily enough.


[9/21/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
and finally, Fin Merriweather, a halfling I made up, is just 

---
tags: [status/stub, status/needswork/internal, person]
species: halfling
---

because I dropped a %% on the page with everything I know about him. In theory, if you wanted to rewrite the page you could.


[9/21/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
One other thought... I think for PC pages there is no point in status tags like "needs work". The pc tag should be an indiciation that this page is "special" so if the page has a header and 1-2 sentences I'm going to just delete status

on separate topic - do you have any notes on how the traveler is depicted?


[9/21/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
the wanderer you mean?


[9/21/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yse wanderer


[9/21/2024 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
this is what the note says but not sure it is up to date: "The Wanderer is usually depicted as a young man, dressed as a traveler or a merchant, in a cloak, with a walking staff or a scale."


[9/21/2024 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
One sec. Z is having a friend over for a sleepover and he just arrived


[9/21/2024 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
Despite having a player who is a paladin of the Wanderer the specific visual aesthic hasn't come up much. I think the above is basically about right, although I suspect some depictions might focus on the charitible side of him


[9/21/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not 100% sure what would be though; in my game the focus has very much been on the "charity/outcasts"


[9/22/2024 9:22 AM] rsulfuratus
you did a lot yesterday, just pulled the changes. mostly need to finish colorado prep and do a bit of work work today but might do a bit of tag updating and note cleanup in between other tasks, especially sorting status/tim things.

one thing to check - you didn't add anything about status/cleanup to the status doc, is this useful to keep? this is where i've stuck things that need various bits of metadata cleanup as opposed to text, and i see you also added status/cleanup/map to mostreve hills. 

might also be a decent tag to use for status/cleanup/image.

maybe change from status/cleanup to status/metadata? 

so then you'd have status/metadata (header, refactor, image, map)

and move what is currently status/cleanup/reformat into status/needswork/reformat


[9/22/2024 9:26 AM] .deciusmus
I like status/cleanup for basically "this note is accurate, use it as canon, but it could be improved"


[9/22/2024 9:26 AM] rsulfuratus
right, yeah. i guess i'm wondering if it is useful to have a separate "this note could use better metadata (header, image, map)"


[9/22/2024 9:28 AM] rsulfuratus
right now cleanup has ~60 notes that are missing header information, 15 that have various complex metadata cleanup (usually items that are specific examples of a common item that aren't well captured in current metadata), and 11 that are basically true cleanup (text is accurate but organization is outdated)


[9/22/2024 9:31 AM] rsulfuratus
my temptation is to move things as follows:
- status/cleanup (header, map, refactor) -> status/metadata (header, map, refactor)
- status/cleanup/reformat -> status/needswork/internal
- status/image -> status/metadata/image


[9/22/2024 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
I think it‚Äôs useful to distinguish between 
(A) metadata cleanup
(B) rethink/rework because it isn‚Äôt accurate / contents are not right
(C) rewrite because I.e it is very focused on a specific campaign but the contents are fine


[9/22/2024 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
I think in theory needswork/internal could be used for (c) as long as there is a %% saying ie %could use language cleanup, but complete%%


[9/22/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe it is useful to have a separate needswork/rewrite. just thinking in terms of how i use status tags, there is a distsinction between collating information and polishing text and sometimes i just want to polish text


[9/22/2024 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
My goal was to be able to distinguish between 5 types of ‚Äúneedswork‚Äù:
- text polishing and writing/improving where all info is on the page itself
- text polishing and writing/improving where all info is in obsidian but needs digging or alignment (ie make sure such and such ruler page aligns with timeline)
- info is scattered between discord/email/obisidian but all shared
- info is not in a shared source but exists on paper somewhere 
- info is not in a shared source (usually implying it was used in game/somewhat canonical) and one of us has clear ideas but nothing written (usually implying more brainstorming/future game)


[9/22/2024 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
And then I think there are two other categories:
- complex page that really needs a discussion
- blank slate


[9/22/2024 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think those are great categories


[9/22/2024 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe we need 1 or 2 more tags to cover?


[9/22/2024 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/22/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
I think something like:
- rewrite
- internal
- shared
- external
- wip


[9/22/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
Basically adds shared for external shared and repurposes rewrite for anything where the page itself is complete but not in fully satisfactory form


[9/22/2024 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that works. so what I have as cleanup/reformat should go to needswork/rewrite, and we should split current external to pull the things with notes in discord etc to shared instead of external


[9/22/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/22/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
okay, i'm going to push a few changes then that reorg tags like this and add the status/metadata for things like header, image, map

[9/22/2024 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
there is still one lingering issue imo, which is that there are still a lot of pages that have no status tag and yet might be properly tagged status/active, status/update, or something else like that. which is not really an issue from the point of view of "is the information in this page canonical" but can be an issue for avoiding branching realities if multiple campaigns cover the same ground


[9/22/2024 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus
(e.g., if your players go to Tollen or Addermarch; my addermarch game goes to southern Sembara; Dunmar Frontier goes to Aurbez)


[9/22/2024 11:27 AM] rsulfuratus
in particular, e.g. looking at Tollen, there are a lot of things that are reasonably complete, in that there isn't any additional information invented, but where i have a kind of vibes based sense of the place that isn't fully captured in the notes


[9/22/2024 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
it is probably actually less relevant for dunmar places, because e.g. if your game is going to tollen you'd be well-aware that a lot happened in the dunmar game there (and session notes are pretty detailed for dunmar so you can see all the backlinks).

but for e.g. the cleeanseau game, it isn't really obvious to me what parts of tyrwingha are actually complete and what parts are complete but missing crucial vibes details that are important to keep in mind if creating new stuff


[9/22/2024 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe this is not something that a tag system is good for and maybe not worth really worrying about. although part of me things there should be a status/complete tag for things where truly everything that is in anyone's head about the note is completely captured in the note text, these can get stale fast if someone forgets to change status/complete to status/update


[9/22/2024 11:40 AM] .deciusmus

(They also all have 8 STR, hahaha)


[9/22/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder about a separate status frontmatter item with values like:

Complete 
Active
Blankslate
Owned
Complex

Where the idea is this in particular can be used to set
(A) owned; meaning one of us has a clear sense of this thing/place/whatever that isn‚Äôt captured on the page and best to check before making up stuff
(B) active; meaning this person or location is pretty active in an ongoing game, so page is likely a little stale

I‚Äôm not at my computer was going to look at what you did and some sample pages in a bit. But the intuition here is that what type of work a page needs and it‚Äôs ‚Äúcanon stuff‚Äù might be a little different


[9/22/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i got sucked into tryign to solve a work problem so haven't done that much beyond the initial tag rework, but might do a bit in the next hour (although really should do colorado prep)

but yeah, perhaps the "how easy is this to use in a game" and "how complete is the information" are a bit orthogonal


[9/22/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
from the "use in a game perspective", i think there are really four-ish things. 

- some things are just background detail, exist as mostly a name with perhaps a bit of backstory, but are free to be iterated without complication
- some things might have had significant impact on a campaign, but all the necessary information (including vibes) is captured in some fashion in the note, and the creator doesn't have ongoing plans (or if they do have ongoing plans they are outlined), so this is something that can be iterated
- some things could be iterated/expanded, but there are key missing details (which might be semi-canonical stuff, role playing notes, vibes-based details, or similar) that would make it difficult to expand without further details 
- some things are central to a campaign in a way that makes it difficult for someone else to reuse without extensive discussion


[9/22/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but also I think there is a bit of a challenge, like for example say my question about visual depications of the wanderer. mos numena gods are obviously not in category 4 above, or even 3, but there is just a limitation of how much notes get updated accurately after a campaign


[9/22/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
so there could be something like "this thing comes up a lot; the details are probably fine and this isn't an 'owned' page but maybe if you are curious about something it may have come up in x campaign'


[9/22/2024 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
this often comes up for me because prepping for level 15 is a lot more time consuming for than for lower levels and i'm often hoping that you've invented some ancillary detail and just forgot to update the note


[9/22/2024 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i can usually guess in some cases just from knowing enough about your game, but if we are adding a status frontmatter then somethig like that might be a useful additional category


[9/22/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, some examples:
- Ravignac is cat 1, just a background place. a name I invented to drop in conversation in Addermarch game
- something like Escobar Garavito (dyer's guild scholarship student in Tollen) could easily be cat 2 with a bit of work, there is a big secret note that is largely background and role playing vibes but really doesn't need to be secret at this point. or, perhaps of more relevance, Caerlynn is roughly in the same boat.
- something like Torvaine Watch is cat 3, this was the location of the first adventure for addermarch game, but there is no reason it couldn't be iterated/expanded once I get notes in it (Tollen maybe here as well)
- something like the ruins of Isingue would be cat 4; really until the Dunmar campaign goes there and deals with the ooze it probably shouldn't feature in any other campaign


[9/22/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure this is really that helpful


[9/22/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm about to go shopping but I‚Äôll take a look more in a bit.


[9/22/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I am updating status/tim notes and kind of dismayed at having the first ~2.5 years of dunmar frontier notes, plus all great library notes, in OneNote


[9/22/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
A couple of random thoughts...
(a) I think there is an extent to which different games are just inevitably going to be slightly different, i.e. if my game goes to Tollen at some point (likely) I think some characterizations will end up being just a little different and I don't think that matters at all. 
(b) I think one of the challenges with here is that there are couple of different things we are trying to do with status tagging.


[9/22/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
In particular, there are intersecting quesitons of
(a) is the note "good" (i.e. clear writing, complete metadata, consistent with other notes)
(b) is the note "done" (i.e. does it capture everything that has been made up about this thing)
(c) is the note "available" (i.e. does it represent something that one of us is planning on using/inventing more of/etc)


[9/22/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
side note: is your intention that, e.g., Chardonian Legion should be [organization, status/needswork/wip, status/tim] to indicate that I am the one who has ideas in my head, or should I, having confirmed it is correctly tagged status/wip, delete the status/tim?


[9/22/2024 4:47 PM] .deciusmus
My original intention was the first one, although I think for a lot of things it is probably obvious who "owns it"


[9/22/2024 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
To go back to my list, I think a lot of the confusion here is really about the sublte grey areas between (b) and (c)

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I think if it is necessary to tag who "owns" something that should either be status/needswork/wip-person or wip/person, or indicated in comments. i prefer status/tim to just be things that need to be checked not long-term updates

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah. maybe status/needswork/wip-tim if you think it needs that level of clarity


[9/22/2024 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
And to add, there are layers and layers. So to go back to Caelynn. The page is pretty good and is certainly complete enough for me to use for rumors and such. And probably complete enough to run a side encounter with her, even, where the details can be a little vague.

But it wouldn't be complete enough for me to use her as say a major NPC


[9/22/2024 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right - but there is no reason you couldn't if I added the rest of my notes (which, mostly, are secrets on that page)


[9/22/2024 4:51 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/22/2024 4:51 PM] .deciusmus
But one thing our system doesn't capture very well right now is the difference between:


[9/22/2024 4:52 PM] .deciusmus
(a) I have more notes about this page even though this looks fairly complete vs
(b) I don't have more written notes, but I have a bunch of ideas about what I was thinking about when I invented this page that I used in game vs
(c) I don't have any specific ideas, but I am attached to this page  or intend to at some point make up more about this page, so run stuff by me before using


[9/22/2024 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
For example Cedric Cyfenwid is a paladin of the wyrdling, now dead, that I just tossed off as a potential background story hook. I don't have any real ideas about who he was, but he was originally built to be a hook for one of my pcs. that doesn't mean I'd be against you stealing him for some adventure in Addermarch (his tomb is sacred to the fey, say, and has some connection to ... whatever). But because I originally had some vague plans for him, I'd probably want you to run your invention by me before using it


[9/22/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
But I think our existing status tags don't really capture that very well. And it is useful to be able to distinguish between say Cedric and Oswald Greensborn, a leader of the rangers who I just invented as a name in an old document, who is wide open for whatever uses


[9/22/2024 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so here is one idea. 

status tags should only concern whether the text of the page captures (in a clear, usable way) all in-game knowledge of the thing. they are really from the perspective of an in-world encylopedia or something. if something doesn't have a status tag, that should imply there are no factual details that are missing. 

separately, we need another tag to indicate kind of levels of ownership, which more has to do with either future ideas, or perhaps DM-facing information that wouldn't really make sense to include in a note. 

not sure what the keywords would be, or how to implement with a big backload tagging burden

but i agree it would be nice to have, basically:
- this page is has all the information i have and you are free to use it however you want
- this pages does not have all the information i have, but you are free to use it however you want (with the idea that this would trigger an ask, I want to send my party to Eskbridge, can you add any detail that is missing?)
- this page needs discussion if you want to use the thing


[9/22/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., currently looking at Kharsan, which is actually fairly complicated:
- from the point of view of a generic reference, it is probably done, although I have some more details in OneNote that would be better to capture just to not waste/lose interesting details (such as the names and descriptions of all the Samraat Tombs)
- from the point of view of running a session in the ruins, it is not complete, because I have things like a rough map, that would be very useful if for example for some reason your players decided to go there, if only to save you some time
- but as far as I'm concerned with Grash dead the Dunmar campaign is done with it, so it is available to use


[9/22/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right with of course in that case the added wrinkle that if my PCs went there it would be from before Grash's time.


[9/22/2024 5:09 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, but the map is the same, etc. most of the details don't really concern Grash specifically


[9/22/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/22/2024 5:10 PM] rsulfuratus
like, I have no idea why I made this up, but I have this:

[9/22/2024 5:10 PM] rsulfuratus
re: the Samraat Tombs


[9/22/2024 5:11 PM] .deciusmus
It's a good example to think about... It seems to me that there is a key distinction between:
* There are *important* details missing
* There are *color* details missing but realistically if someone made up spur of the moment color details that ended up conflicting it probably doesn't matter


[9/22/2024 5:12 PM] .deciusmus
And there is also a sense of how much you care


[9/22/2024 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so in this example re: the Samraat Tombs - the only canonical detail that matters is the names and dates of the 12 Aatmaji samraats, plus a few details about Dasa (the last one) who tried to invade Drankor


[9/22/2024 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so if your party went to Kharsan, as long as you had the names of the Samraats, the color details wouldn't matter, and none of the color details are canon anyway, since the Dunmar campaign never explored any of the tombs


[9/22/2024 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but, if you had similar color details about, say the Barony of Broomecliff, I'd certainly want to be aware, because if the Addermarch game goes there it would save me a lot of time


[9/22/2024 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right.


[9/22/2024 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
it is basically a tag that says, either, "I have DM notes that have important canon", vs "I have DM notes that you might find useful"


[9/22/2024 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right. That's a good way of saying it


[9/22/2024 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
And then I think separately, "I have plans for this" vs "I don't have plans for this"


[9/22/2024 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that is the most useful set of distinctions.


[9/22/2024 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
So for example, two villages in Aveil:

Maudorville. The page is just a raw dump of rough notes I made up during session prep. But this was just a jumping off point to get an adventure hook. I neither care about it particularly nor have plans for it nor have any other details


[9/22/2024 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
So the page itself is in rough shape (its just raw notes). But in theory you could rewrite it based on those notes, adding whatever color you wanted, and that could be canon


[9/22/2024 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
Peydon. This page is not somewhere my PCs have gone and it reads pretty completely, with a "DM" note about a hag that controlled it for a while and a link to the in-game story I shared with my PCs about the hag


[9/22/2024 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
But I wouldn't want you to use it, because I don't know if my players will go there. I made it up as a hook and they might try to defeat the hag. Or they might just have other things to do and end up not going there. That said, you could certainly have a character in Addermarch have left Peydon during the time the hag was there, say, if you needed someone from far away with experience of a hag.


[9/22/2024 5:20 PM] .deciusmus
So there is a difference between "preserve someone else's narative space around this thing, but use on the fringes" vs "you don't have to preserve narrative space"


[9/22/2024 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the canon vs color distinction captures that fairly well though


[9/22/2024 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
although canon is not quite the right word.


[9/22/2024 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
important details vs color details maybe


[9/22/2024 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
Is it worth distinguishing between "writing down" vs "in my head" vs "to be made up in the future"


[9/22/2024 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea being a page with either "DM notes exist, contain important information" or "I have plans for this" (regardless of existence or not of DM notes) triggers -> discuss before using


[9/22/2024 5:22 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. for Peyden, I have important details that are going to be made up in the future.


[9/22/2024 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i would think of it as two separate orthogonal things:
DM notes: none, color, important
Plans: yes, no


[9/22/2024 5:23 PM] .deciusmus
Ah


[9/22/2024 5:23 PM] .deciusmus
that seems sensible. If perhaps a bit of a pain to go and add to 500 notes


[9/22/2024 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah the question is how to implement something like this with minimal work


[9/22/2024 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
especially as I have a lot of stuff that has OneNote DM notes but that I don't have future plans for


[9/22/2024 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so anything based on e.g. internal backlinks to unshared notes doesn't help that much


[9/22/2024 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably more important for Addermarch/Sembara stuff than dunmari frontier though


[9/22/2024 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
because that's where direct sharing is more likely


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that's true, and you are also more likely to have a good sense of whether a place was crucial to the dunmar campaign


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
And I can guess  a fair bit based on secret notes as well


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
true although sometimes I just put in blank secrets to mislead you


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. an NPC that was introduced "recently" (i.e. since we cut over to Obsidian) without a %%SECRET%% is almost certainly not important


[9/22/2024 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that is true


[9/22/2024 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
(assuming there is anything on the page, sometimes I make stubs before copying stuff)


[9/22/2024 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I was just for example looking through Tollen humans and there is actually a secret tag on almost all of them


[9/22/2024 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
many of those are just my notes for how to roleplay the person, which doesn't really need to be secret anymore but I didn't want to just push directly before you met them


[9/22/2024 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I assumed


[9/22/2024 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but in some cases there might be actual secrets


[9/22/2024 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
and it can be a bit of work to disentangle, so it would be a lot faster for me to tag those all as "dm notes / color" or "dm notes / important" than actually disentangle


[9/22/2024 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
then if you want to use someone I can do the work


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
So what if we said, going forward:

dm_notes: none | color | important 
dm_plans: yes | no

Then status tagging is just for "encyclopedia" style reference.


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
is it better as front matter or tags?


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
I think front matter


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
okay


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure


[9/22/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
easy to programmatically convert if desired later


[9/22/2024 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/22/2024 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
as far as dealing with notes that don't have that frontmatter set, I'd propose:

(1) for anything with a status tag, assume plans or DM notes might exist. tag status/(relevant person) if you update to remove status tag with a note %% set dm/plans info %%
(2) for anything without a status tag that is in greater sembara, assume plans: yes and notes: important until confirmed
(3) for anything outside greater sembara, not likely to come up, but I will try to set frontmatter for all the "complete" pages when I have time


[9/22/2024 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not sure what to do with pages outside gazetteer, people, groups though


[9/22/2024 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
as an example: for a while I had a lot of notes about dwarven religious practice that were relevant to the baharazel page but only existed as dm notes. 

i guess in this case status tags are probably more useful though?


[9/22/2024 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
So the idea is that you could have a couple of different types of pages:

* No status tag; dm_notes: color or important. The page is complete as it is, but there is another level of detail in dm notes (which could just be "dm head" notes doesn't  have to be written). If the notes are important, probably need to check before going to / meeting person.
* No status tag; dm_notes: none; nothing else exists

Then 
* status/needswork/rewrite - all the info is on the page, but it isn't in shape to publish
* status/needswork/internal - all the info is in obsidian, but isn't in shape to publish
* status/needswork/external - the info is in discord/email, but isn't in shape to publish
* status/needswork/wip - the info is only in DM notes, page can't really be used at all other than as a name; once it is in a usable state swap to no status tag and dm_notes:


[9/22/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
I would say that Worldbuilding, Species, and Cosmology is "special"


[9/22/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
and that we are just going to have to use judgement on those, and status tagging might not serve a ton of use


[9/22/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
Things and Time the above should be ok on


[9/22/2024 5:40 PM] .deciusmus
+ History to "special" + Events ot "use the tags"


[9/22/2024 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure I understand when you tag someone? If I update say some random village in Aveil to set dm_notes and dm_plans am I supposed to tag you?


[9/22/2024 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
i think my idea is if you remove a status tag from something that isn't "your" page, e.g. because the status tag was just collating or rewriting, you should tag the other person


[9/22/2024 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
ah ,ok


[9/22/2024 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
if you remove a status tag from your page, you should set dm_notes and dm_plans


[9/22/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
So this feels like it would work well. I'm going though People/Sembarans just to set tags


[9/22/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
dm_notes: none | color | important
dm_plans: no | yes

right?


[9/22/2024 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/22/2024 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
What do you think of using "wip" to basically mean: "there is no meaningful information except in DM notes; I need to copy over before you could really use this page"

vs "external" to mean: the info is in a _shared_ external place


[9/22/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
vs "no status tag" + dm_notes: color | important to mean "this page is good enough for some purposes, but I have more DM notes"


[9/22/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
most of the things tagged external are actually not shared as it is largely my onenote library


[9/22/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i think status/needswork/shared is fine


[9/22/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
yes, but is that still useful to you?


[9/22/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
I think my point is that we should be trying to distinguish between "the page is useable but dm notes has more info" vs "the page isn't useable"


[9/22/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
yes it is very useful to me because I don't have OneNote on my work computer so if I'm updating notes when I'm supposed to be working I can't work on anything with status/needswork/external


[9/22/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
right ok


[9/22/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but I do have discord and email so status/needswork/shared is fine


[9/22/2024 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
i think something with status/needswork/external should always *also* have a dm_notes and dm_plans tag


[9/22/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
See.. I want to be able to distinguish between "basic" and "detailed" info


[9/22/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. take Airion (a random page with status/needswork/external)


[9/22/2024 5:50 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be dm_notes: important dm_plans: yes


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
right but also I think that the contents in obsidian right now are sufficient for some purposes


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but actually that is a little tricky because the dm_plans only exist if isaac's great library campaign gets to high level


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, maybe not. It depends on how important the "important" dm notes are


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, I see


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
Amberglow is a better example


[9/22/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
actually Airion is a good example, in that there is enough information that if you needed an author for a book of lore about the plane of fire for your party to find, Airion's Tome of Fire (or whatever) would be perfect


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
That's what I was going for


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but if your players then decide to go researching "who was Airion" you need more information


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
But if for example, he actually wasn't real at all, I need to know that as well before making him the author of a book


[9/22/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right, exactly. you want some sense of "how much can I use the information on this page at face value"


[9/22/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
So there is a difference between "yes, what is on the page is solid/canonical/usable" but there are DM notes that are important vs "no, what on the page is not solid/canonical/usable"


[9/22/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
That's I think the difference between "needswork" and "cleanup"


[9/22/2024 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm, yeah.


[9/22/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe just separately status/needswork from status/cleanup makes sense then


[9/22/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
there are only 380 pages with status/needswork it would be pretty fast to move the ones that are correct but incomplete to cleanup


[9/22/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
with the same categories


[9/22/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
so cleanup means "nothing on the page is wrong but there are more details"


[9/22/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
and I think crucially means "the extra details don't complicate the page"


[9/22/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example for Airion, if there is something about him that is  atypical for a stereotypical " powerful mage with connections to elemental planes" - say, he was illiterate somehow - that would need to be noted for status/cleanup to be appropriate


[9/22/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
that seems exactly correct


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, take Alaric Benec, the Lord Mayor of Rinburg


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
I have no plans for him, and only color info


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
But the page is entirely blank other than a header


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
so because nothing is written, I'm writing status/needswork/wip, dm_notes: color, dm_plans: no

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
if I write enough color that he'd be vaguely useable, I'd get rid of status/needswork and leave dm_notes" color
If I write up all the color I made up for him, then I also change dm_notes to none


[9/22/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
If my color was written done in my internal DM folder, or some email to me players, I would potentially set needswork/external rather than needswork/wip

if on the other hand the color was in a discord chat with you, I'd set needswork/shared. If the ONLY meaningful color was in a chat with you, I'd set needswork/shared, dm_notes: none


[9/22/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
so generally then I think the implication is:

- if there are status tags besides status/cleanup or status/metadata, the page is likely not usable in current form
- if there are no status tags, or just status/cleanup or status/metadata tags, and

(a) dm_notes: color, the page is usable but someone else might have useful details to save time. 
(b) dm_notes: none, the page is usable and you are on your own
(c) dm_notes: important, the page is not usable for anything other than minor background without discussion

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
If all the color was in some letter that I wrote up for my players, I would set dm_notes: none, needswork/internal and add a %% like

%% see [[ letter about alaric ]] for color info %%


[9/22/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
(this all assumes dm_plans: no, if dm_plans: yes then should always check, I think)

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
The other implication (should be) that if 
(a) dm_notes: none
(b) status of status/needswork/internal or status/needswork/shared

Then you are on your own, but if you want to do the splunking in discord/obsidian go for it

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
(again assuming dm_plans: no)


[9/22/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess the only complication is what if we both have plans? mostly involves Feywild, e.g. Amberglow / Duskmire and related places


[9/22/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
I think those pages are pretty clear, right? The implication of anyone having plans is to discuss the details, right? so does it matter?


[9/22/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I guess it doesn't matter


[9/22/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
ideally for pages like that we should try to make sure that all information is captured in the note itself, in the style of the duskmire page which has comments with canon from addermarch and cleenseau


[9/22/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
yeha


[9/22/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
I think in shared pages it is just more important to try to avoid dm_note: importnat


[9/22/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[9/22/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
and in general, the world is pretty proscribed as well... Dunmar Frontier kinda has "first dibs" on secrets


[9/22/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
so it is fairly obvious where there is significant overlap


[9/22/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
in what might be dm plans, and I think it is a small enough space that it is easy to work out


[9/22/2024 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
if you say, ran a new campaign in Tollen once Dunmari frontier is over it gets more complicated but we can cross that bridge when we come to it


[9/22/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[9/22/2024 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i have to go make dinner but i am going to try to push a bunch of status moves (from needswork -> cleanup where appropriate) and add dm notes


[9/22/2024 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
later tonight


[9/22/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
k


[9/22/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
I also have to go make dinner, but dana doesn't get home til 11 so might / likely will do more as well


[9/22/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
I'm working on Sembarans & Aveil folders to start


[9/22/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
but i will try to push frequently to avoid conflicts


[9/22/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
A few notes as I do this... 

status/update is another tag that doesn't mean the page is unusable per se; I am using the dm_notes to track how important the update is.

(i.e. a character who has had significant event happen might get status/update, dm_notes: important)

It's really much easier than other status attempts we've done. I might be slightly overtagged dm_notes: color but it is a good shorthand way to basically say: "I have thoughts about this person that might not be here"


[9/22/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm adding dm_notes / dm_plans at the very bottom of metadata, so it is easy to see


[9/22/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
at some point I might update the header JS to flag on the page body somehow


[9/22/2024 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
here is a slightly complicated one. 

Sir Einrik Arpaad was the commander of Torvaine Watch, was possessed by a cursed dagger, killed the soldiers in the watch, and became a ghost. Deciphering mystery was first addermarch adventure. i have a bunch of notes about the ghost, the cursed dagger, and such that I haven't put in the main note. 

but i have no future plans and if your party ever went to addermarch prior to the events of the addermarch campaign how he eventually dies doesn't matter

would you tag that as dm_notes: color or dm_notes: none or dm_notes: important?


[9/22/2024 6:52 PM] .deciusmus
I'd tag as color and then add something like
%% Become a ghost in one of the early Addermarch adevntures %%


[9/22/2024 6:52 PM] rsulfuratus
great, that is exactly what I did


[9/22/2024 6:53 PM] .deciusmus
I had a complicated one as well..

Duncan Rivers is an innkeeper in Cleenseau. I have no plans to do anything with him per se, but the ale  barrels in his basement were being drunk by a somewhat surly fairy. My PCs never figured out the details, and might still go investigate.

dm_plans: yes ? or no?


[9/22/2024 6:55 PM] rsulfuratus
probably would be dm_plans: no on Duncan Rivers. dm_plans: yes on the note for the inn, if it exists. 

dm_plans: yes on Duncan if the inn doesn't have a page


[9/22/2024 6:55 PM] .deciusmus
right, that makes sense


[9/22/2024 6:56 PM] .deciusmus
here's another one. Is it reasonable to assume someone would check the family page?

I have a npc, Jean-Luc d'Aslain, who is minor but I have some important details about the d'Aslain family in DM notes


[9/22/2024 6:56 PM] .deciusmus
Is dm_notes: important on the d'Aslain page good enough?


[9/22/2024 6:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, i think reasonable to assume linked pages get checked


[9/22/2024 6:57 PM] rsulfuratus
if both d'Aslain and Jean-Luc d'Aslain are tagged dm_notes: important I'd assume you have some specific to Jean-Luc in your notes

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 7:00 PM] .deciusmus
So I have:

Jean-Luc d'Aslain 
no status tag, dm_notes: color, dm_plans: no

d'Aslain family
body of page is just
A longstanding noble family in the Barony of Aveil with an ancient history. One of the wealthiest families in the [[Auberonne]] river valley.

dm_notes: important
dm_plans: yes


[9/22/2024 7:01 PM] .deciusmus
My intention is that jean-luc is minor character, but my pcs have met him a few times and I haven't detailed the color interactions.

the dAslain family on the other hand has some complex behind the scenes stuff going on, but the basic sentence above is totally correct


[9/22/2024 7:06 PM] rsulfuratus
so another linked thing - Einrik, mentioned above, was possessed by a cursed dagger. while the details of Einrik's story aren't important, the cursed dagger might be. 

Einrik -> status/cleanup/external, dm_notes: color, dm_plans: no
Dagger -> status/needswork/wip, dm_notes: important, dm_plans: yes

is that clear what the intention is?


[9/22/2024 7:06 PM] .deciusmus
i would assume using Einrik is fine, although to get color from you if my pcs were going to met them; but that the dagger is not useable in current state

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 7:07 PM] rsulfuratus
perfect


[9/22/2024 7:07 PM] .deciusmus
btw, I am finding the status/stub doesn't make a ton of sense anymore


[9/22/2024 7:08 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. a page that is dm_notes: none, dm_plans: no, where only the header is useful could just be status/cleanup/header


[9/22/2024 7:08 PM] rsulfuratus
what would you use then for, e.g. Buruli. current page content is just:

```
---
tags: [status/stub, person]
---
```


[9/22/2024 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
dm_plans: ??
dm_notes: important
status/needswork/wip


[9/22/2024 7:09 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm.


[9/22/2024 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
stub is maybe most useful actually to mean: I haven't set plans or notes yet


[9/22/2024 7:10 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. when you are creating a page quickly to make sure you get the spelling right across a couple of different other notes or from session notes or whatever, and don't even want to set the status flags


[9/22/2024 7:10 PM] .deciusmus
the problem is that without dm plans/notes, it is hard to know what status/stub means


[9/22/2024 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
my workflow is pretty different from yours, I often go:
1. write session notes and bracket anything that should have a note
2. set status/stub and proper person/item etc to every created note
3. try to find time to go back and fill in more information


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think status/stub should actually mean "no status info set yet" not "just needs a header"


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
my dm notes are typically organized by session, I don't usually pre-create notes


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that makes sense


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
when you go back, you can switch to status/cleanup/header if that is all it needs

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 7:12 PM] .deciusmus
My workflow is usually..

make a list in the DM folder for session prep
if I make an image, create a page to hold the image in DM
if the PCs actually met the person, move page to People


[9/22/2024 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
but anyway, I think status/stub = no one has set the DM info and only the creator of the page should remove it


[9/22/2024 7:19 PM] rsulfuratus
here is another edge case. 

i have a few notes where the only missing information is whereabouts. there aren't any additional useful dm_notes and I have no plans, but their locations at certain times is canonical. 

inclination is just status/cleanup/header with a comment "%% canonical whereabouts between XX and YY not captured yet%% as it is a pretty rare edge case


[9/22/2024 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that seems reasonable.


[9/22/2024 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
here's another tricky one...

Lambert Talwrey. He's dead, but the PCs were invstigating his murder. Other than a convinent dead body, no details about him.

The details of the murderer, however, are complex.


[9/22/2024 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
is the murderer linked from the note? if yes i'm not sure how this is different from my Einrik / cursed dagger example


[9/22/2024 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
right, I guess its the same


[9/22/2024 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
the murderer was a fey changeling, but I thinked both the actual fey and the person she was changed into


[9/22/2024 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
*linked


[9/22/2024 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
here's another one I'm not sure on.

Remille Vauclaire. A ranger and low-ish level fighter. Originally from Adderfell. 

no real details or plans, but she is currently on the periphry of key events in Aveil in my game, so always a chance she somehow gets involved.

Just set dm_plans: yes? Or something else


[9/22/2024 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
(the whereabouts tracks her location accurately, but you'd have to know where my next couple of sessions are going to be to know she is nearby to them...)


[9/22/2024 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah probably just dm_plans: yes is sufficient there


[9/22/2024 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
did you make a page on the de Brune family


[9/22/2024 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
no


[9/22/2024 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
someone should


[9/22/2024 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
i am behind a lot addermarch stuff due to the complexity of prepping for level 15


[9/22/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
I made one

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
just a stub for now


[9/22/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
for someone like Tristan, where there are lots of notes but all in shared email, but where I have plans:

status/needswork/shared
dm_notes: none
dm_plans: yes

right?


[9/22/2024 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/22/2024 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
ok i've finished all the sembaran people


[9/22/2024 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
and for someone like Marcel de Valarin, where I have
(a) nothing really written
(b) bullet notes in %% on the page
(c) plans

It would be:
status/needswork/internal
dm_notes: none
dm_plans: yes

right?


[9/22/2024 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i have something similar for Caradoc in Addermarch


[9/22/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
although if all the relevant information is on the page in note form, shouldn't it be status/cleanup/internal?


[9/22/2024 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
needswork/internal implies there is missing info in other notes that you need to collate

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, here is one.

Agon, Vola's mentor in Chardon. the note is complete except for secrets. tagged dm_notes: important and dm_plans: yes

does it need a status tag?


[9/22/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
no


[9/22/2024 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
also: what is the difference between status/cleanup/header and status/metadata/header? 

is cleanup/header just a replacement for metadata/header?


[9/22/2024 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
that's your call üôÇ


[9/22/2024 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
but yes, I think they are the same


[9/22/2024 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
dunno if metadata/header or cleanup/header is better


[9/22/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i think metadata/header is better
cleanup | needswork to me imply text editing

metadata/header, metadata/image, metadata/map is non-text editing

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i am changing now


[9/22/2024 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed


[9/22/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
here's one.. Avatus.

I dropped lots of hints about him in my Cleenseau game, but all as deep background/history and backstory for why there was a buried fort and/or various hobgoblin skeletons coming to life


[9/22/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
Ultimately whatever the "real" details it could have come down to 1720 garbled, so nothing I dropped necessarily has to be canonical


[9/22/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
dm_notes: color?


[9/22/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[9/22/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
long dead fey:
People/Fey or People/historical figures ?


[9/22/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
i moved needswork/rewrite to cleanup and recategorized all the notes with that tag as either cleaup/internal or cleanup/external

cleanup/internal implies you can fix the page just by what is on the page
cleanup/external implies color details or other non-crucial information might need to be collated from other sources

example: Cavarrio's Chronicles of Drankor needs to be rewritten into a proper source, as it is supposed to represent an in-world book. i have a few notes about possible errors in Cavarrio's work but nothing canonical (otherwise would be: dm_notes: important). but, if anyone wants to do this, it requires at least collating with the "correct" Drankorian history and so is a bit more complex than, e.g., the similar "Story about Hags" which just needs a quick Taelgarification


[9/22/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
does that make sense?


[9/22/2024 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
similar: 

Marcella is [person, status/needswork/external, status/metadata/header, status/cleanup/internal] with a note 
%% need to fix whereabouts, campaign info, away dates %%
%% fix text to change session links %%

the implication is supposed to be than anyone could rewrite the text to remove "Felt forced to try to steal from party in [[Session 44 (DuFr)]]," into a dufr campaign block. 

but also tagged status/needswork/external to indicate there is important information not captured


[9/22/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure that is super clear but also not sure it really matters?


[9/22/2024 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
right i mean i'm the only one who is likely to be working on marcella's note


[9/22/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
what's the right tag for "factually accurate but feels a like sparse"


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
although, re: marcella and similar, the reason to tag status/cleanup/internal is that theoretically it would be feasible for you to rewrite some of those pages (e.g., Marcella, Hektor, other NPCs you encountered) that currently have a lot of bare session note links into something a little cleaner


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
does that need a tag?


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
I guess not


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
re: marcella I think the main thing is that the external tag implies that the information on the page isn't really adequately complete


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
although if there is something that feels sparse that you know is a page I created, status/tim and a %% is reasonable


[9/22/2024 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
So i.e. a page wth
dm_notes: color
status/cleanup/internal

feels like, hey, a rewrite will be ok

status/needswork/external
implies that you can't trust the page


[9/22/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
ah i see so the combination of both tags is confusing


[9/22/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the proper tag for "information is correct but badly incomplete"


[9/22/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
status/cleanup/external?


[9/22/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
I think dm_notes: importat


[9/22/2024 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for marcella nothing is misleading or wrong about the text but 
(a) the header whereabouts are badly incomplete
(b) there are additional important details in my notes (dm_notes: important)
(c) the page itself needs a rewrite to both fix internal linking and incorporate external notes that give more crucial information


[9/22/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
I would call that status/metadata/header, status/cleanup/internal


[9/22/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
dm_notes: important


[9/22/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm. 

i feel like it is useful for me to have a tag that says "there is external information i need to copy to this page" that is distinct from "i have important dm notes"


[9/22/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
right, see I haven't been bothering with that


[9/22/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
I think status/cleanup/<whatever you want to use>


[9/22/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
or just status/<whatever you want to use>


[9/22/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
you could do something like status/onenote separate from the rest of the status tagging we are doing


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, so for you the crucial thing is:
needswork -> the page can't be used because the information is misleading, non-canon, so incomplete as to prevent meaningful use in a game
cleanup -> the page might not be complete in some abstract sense but it isn't missing any critical information


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
The main thing to me is that

(a) status/needswork means "don't trust the page"
(b) status/needswork/<internal|shared> means "but the way to fix it is in obsidian or shared email


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
anything else is less important to me


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
oh, and status/stub means "creator has to finish creating it"


[9/22/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay. so i can use whatever status/cleanup subtags I want and you don't really care if they have meaning to you, as long as the "cleanup" / "needswork" distinction is maintained and "internal" / "shared" have consistent meaning


[9/22/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
yes

[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
It would be good to agree on a tag for "the page has all the details" as well (to distinguish from "obsidian has the details")


[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
I think earlier we said status/cleanup/internal


[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I am using internal for this


[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
consistently across cleanup and needswork, where needswork/internal implies usually that obsidian has the details (as otherwise it would just be cleanup/internal)

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i think internal just means "in obsidian", shared means "discord/email", external means "something only the creator can access"

{Reactions}
üëç

[9/22/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think generally cleanup/internal should be reserved for "rewrite the page without external references"


[9/22/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
there are a few pages where we both might have dm notes.. i.e. the Rangers


[9/22/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
I guess earlier we said we'd try to keep the notes in obsidian for those


[9/22/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think okay to see how things shake out a bit


[9/22/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
if we find there are tags that don't make sense or are unclear can just refactor easily with the tag manager in obsidian


[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
also we should try to check the needswork pages to clean up the ones that don't actually need work (in general, i would assume that if a page has a dm_notes/dm_plans frontmatter the status tag is correct, if not then maybe not)

[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
I've been fixing status tags as a I go


[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
I aslos added a missing dm info page in MoC


[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i saw


[9/22/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder if there is use in having something like a dm_notes: shared


[9/22/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
for pages we know we are both going to be potentially referencing, i.e. Shattered Ice Clan, Rangers, some Feywild stuff


[9/22/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean that should never really happen, if we both have dm_notes we should be doing it in  comments on the page, or in worldbuilding if particularly complex

a dm_plans: [clee, adm] might be useful though?


[9/22/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
dm_notes: color|important|none is a logical OR operation. if either of us have dm notes it gets set to the highest level


[9/22/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
with the goal of eventually moving all DM notes to %% for shared things


[9/22/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but I guess if it is useful to track where that hasn't happened yet, dm_notes: shared could be good?


[9/22/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
or if it useful to track places where there are multiple %% canon from XXX %% notes?


[9/22/2024 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but in some ways plans are better - e.g. if your PCs go to adderfell, setting dm_plans: [clee] and tagging status/tim is a good way to mark that I need to dump anything useful, but really discord is best for this


[9/22/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/22/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
probably lets stick with what we agreed and not overthink fo rnow


[9/22/2024 10:22 PM] .deciusmus
I'm stopping for the night: one last thought.

I'm using "needswork/shared" as a rough shorthand for pages that I created originally but where I have no particular information, but also where the info in obsidian is inadequate, i.e. the highland kingdoms


[9/22/2024 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
I also think that "PCs will go to a place at some point" is not a good reason for dm_plans: yes


[9/23/2024 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
Is it fair to say that any place with status/stub and a ~ name is fair to fixup and set dm_notes/dm_plans to no?


[9/23/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
Also, is it fair to set status/cleanup/internal rather than status/needswork/internal when there is not much made up, but some of it is on well-organized backlinks rather than the page itself?


[9/23/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I think status/cleanup/internal is reasonable for notes where most information is available but only through backlinks, yes


[9/23/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
For this, I guess with the exception of places that are not "clearly on the map"


[9/23/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
(I have a few minutes while I eat lunch, and I'm trying to reduce the number of status/stub so when I add new pages with status/stub it is easier to find them)


[9/23/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
re: status/stubs, I'm not sure that is entirely correct? i guess the concept of dm_plans for places is a little nebulous. but lots of status/stub pages i do actually have notes. e.g. Emerald Coast, Northern Boreal Forest, North Chardon Coast, Great Desert, Eastern Islands


[9/23/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess setting them to status/needswork/<something> and dm_notes: no might be fine and accomplish the same thing


[9/23/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess my point is there are plenty of place stubs that are in the "can't be used without more info" category


[9/23/2024 1:46 PM] .deciusmus
that's kinda what I mean by "clearly on the map"


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm a little confused. the North Chardon Coast is clearly on the map, is it not?


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but i have a fair bit of notes in a totally disorganized and not-necessarily-canon bunch of dm notes on the chardonian empire


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] .deciusmus
Yes, that is. 
Great Desert / Eastern Islands are not


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so it isn't really "a place you can use" as if you wanted to send your players there I'd need to sort out what is color, what is important, etc


[9/23/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess that's true. In that sense, leaving as stub is important actually


[9/23/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure that "clearly on the map" is an accurate guide to whether a place stub has unincorporated dm information is all i'm saying


[9/23/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
if you need to get rid of my stubs you can tag things you don't know what to do with status/stub-tim or something


[9/23/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
or status/stub, status/tim and just exclude things with status/tim from your stub search


[9/23/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
no, if you have a lot of places with unincorporated DM notes I won't bother


[9/23/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
I was vaguely assuming you didn't have a lot of notes about regions that were not in obsidian except for the "weird" places on the far edges of things


[9/23/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
but I guess a lot of the places Great Library campaign went to you probably do have notes in OneNote or whatever


[9/23/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
the west coast is in kind of bad shape, it has (a) a bunch of great library stuff, and (b) a bunch of half made up notes when I thought you were going to go to Chardon and deal with Fausto directly before looking for the jade pieces  or on the way to the merfolk kelp


[9/23/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
and the whole chasa river valley / elderwood is all pre-obsidian so has a lot of stubs too


[9/23/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
have you considered at all why werewolves turn during the full moon?


[9/23/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
is it just that pandemonium is closer to taelgar? something else? just pondering in relationship to my PC who is dedicated to the moon


[9/23/2024 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I wrote this as an intro during the werewolf arc but nothing beyond the implications here:

The world turns, night falls, and the stars begin to flicker in the sky over Dunmar. As the Fox and Hunter drift above the horizon, they watch the full moon rising for the 2,514th time, and listen. Their attention, as always, is drawn to the east, and north, where the prayers are the brightest and loudest, the hopes for safety, for healing, for peace that echo across the borderlands. They reach out, as they do every night, granting what minor miracles they can to the rangers who keep Sembara safe from the darkness of the Plague Lands.

The work is easy tonight. As the moon turns to full the tidal pull of the Divine Presence grows stronger, filling the land, and the Source is easy to reach. The Fox thinks of days running in the forests of the north, and stretches across the world. The Hunter calls to him, reminds him of the task ahead, but remembers the joy of those early days too, the thrill and power of just running in the deep forests where he met the Fox.

Their attention, though, does not stay on the forested Mostreve hills on the southern reaches of Sembara, nor the arid foothills where the people of the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez scratch out a living on the edge of the Plague Lands. The full moon also draws the darkness of the Void closer. The Hunter, always with one small part of his essence watching those who carry echoes of his companions of old, sees the madness pour into the soul of a poor innocent boy, a young dwarf not even of age, in west of Dunmar.

(cont)


[9/23/2024 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
While the Fox tends to the prayers of the rangers of Sembara, the Hunter watches Dunmar more closely for a moment. Across the desert and dry arid plains -- so hard not to cast the land in his mind's eye as it was -- the People of the Horse are moving. Sura, the sister of the current Samraat, has returned from an unreachable prison, and many people are gathering in her camps. And yet she is not marching to war, not yet.

North of the city of Tokra, an old woman sits by the fire, wondering. The Hunter watches her a moment, sees the prayers streaming to Bhishma, asking when the strange travelers of her dreams will arrive, and how much should she tell them when they do? He senses the tangled future, but there is little he can do to shape that destiny.

In Tokra, the poor innocent is snarling, consumed with the madness of Jinnik on this night of power. The waves of the Void crash over him, each wave reaching higher and higher up the beach, threatening to overwhelm his soul, until suddenly there is calm, clear water and silver twilight in the forests. The Fox comes running -- is this my home? No, the Hunter says, just an echo of what was lost, but that echo still has power.

The tide madness recedes from the boy, but not from everywhere in this city. Elsewhere, the darkness of the Void is pulled tight, bound together with the souls of those who have submitted to its power. It will be harder to free these of the curse.


[9/24/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I‚Äôm mostly pretty busy with work today and tomorrow but I was playing around a bit more with DM notes and status tags, and I think we are still missing one categorization mechanism‚Ä¶


[9/24/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
Specifically there are a handful of pages that are about either big ‚Äúworld level‚Äù things (Mos Numena, Elves) or major regional level things (Chardonian Empire, Sembara, Tyrwingha)


[9/24/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
These pages are all characterized by the ability to have kinda endless spiraling detail (much of which isn‚Äôt relevant for a player facing webpage but is useful when making up new related things) and also a somewhat iterative approach to development and somewhat of a potential to be invented at some level even without a game reason


[9/24/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
They are also the pages where ‚Äúdone‚Äù is the hardest to define as at some level they are never done


[9/24/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there are several separate things here:

(1) There is: does the note in question contain enough accurate information for me to run a [session, arc, one-shot, mini-series, campaign] there and usefully leverage existing lore? Or separately to use it as background color? 
(2) There is: is another DM actively working in this area, such that I should discuss if I am actively running something involving this note? 
(3) There is: does this note capture all the information that has been invented about this thing?
(4) There is: does this note have a level of detail that is appropriate to its centrality in the world? That is, is this a place that would benefit from invention because it seems thin at the moment?


[9/24/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I think (1) is well-captured by status tags, primarily needswork but also active, update and dm_notes


[9/24/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) is captured by dm_plans


[9/24/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
(3) is generally captured by status/cleanup and perhaps status/metadata


[9/24/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not sure that (4) needs to be marked in any particular way?


[9/24/2024 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. the Sembara page is clearly not currently adequate to run a game in Sembara without relying on outside information, so it is correctly tagged status/needswork (probably should be more detail but I think there are both shared and external notes). but does it need a separate tag that says "this is world-relevant?"


[9/24/2024 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
So a good example is the Duchy of Maseau. 

The page right now is both (a) pretty thin and (b) not fully up to date some of the latest invention on Isingue and the hobgoblin wars. 

I have some background color that I‚Äôve tossed out in both my Aussons mini series and current game but nothing really meaningful or that I care about being particularly canonical


[9/24/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
And I currently don‚Äôt have any plans to send my PCs there but it‚Äôs kinda lurking on the border of my game always a couple of random moments of invention away from at least being semi-relevant


[9/24/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
So what‚Äôs the right status for the page?


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] .deciusmus
Or take sembara? What level of work is required to change from needswork to some other status tag? Is a 5-10 sentence summary (good enough for a game in Dunmar) enough?


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it needs work. it would be tough - possibly misleading - to try to do much invention there relying entirely on the details on the page itself, especially given more recent inventions in addermarch and southern sembara that directly impinge on Maseau


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I would tag it status/needswork (shared/external/nothing depending)


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
and also dm_notes: color and dm_plans: no


[9/24/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe status/needswork/internal if it is just about refactoring based on details of hobgoblin history


[9/24/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
my mental test is "if I was going to run a low level one shot somewhere random in taelgar, do I feel like I could reasonably invent a small town and a nearby ruin that would not create contradictions"


[9/24/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
personally I would keep Sembara as needswork until it reaches the level of detail of e.g. Dunmar which I think is a particularly complete note


[9/24/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
but if you would prefer finer granularity then perhaps a distinction between "wrong/bad don't use" and "incomplete" is what you are looking for?


[9/24/2024 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I also think addermarch is a good example - I basically invented everything I felt like I wanted to know to reliably be able to improvise history/ruins/towns in addermarch, and it is largely all in one place, the note in obsidian


[9/24/2024 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
Yes, I think that is most of it. I think there is a spiraling level of detail, i.e.

Good enough to toss out as color -> good enough to touch down for part of a session or be used as PC background -> good enough to run a few adventures -> good enough to run a campaign


[9/24/2024 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
so i agree it would be useful to have that kind of information embedded in each note but i'm not sure what the tagging system would be, especially what it would be that wouldn't add a large refactorization workload


[9/24/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but also isn't that kind of a judgement call that is hard to pin down?

that is, if we use status tags and DM notes to reliably track how much information exists about <thing x> that is not recorded on the <thing x> note, then if you are looking at a page that has no status tags or DM notes but is still not complete enough to run in, maybe you need to make some stuff up


[9/24/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i feel like the important point of status tags is to be able to see "how much stuff is invented about this place already but is missing from the note"


[9/24/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
(but this elides the "is the stuff here wrong or just incomplete")


[9/24/2024 3:53 PM] .deciusmus
What is the right status tag for Ardlas? There is basically nothing invented about it, although we had a couple of discussions about highlander kingdom vibes, and there is a bit of deep history in worldbuilding documents about Ardlas


[9/24/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
The other part of this for me at least is trying to reduce the # of items with status tags


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
So i.e. if I have a bit of time in the evening I might want to pick a few "status/needsworks" to clean up.


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
I was contemplating having something like a status/complex


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
for "world-level" pages


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
which would just be permanent


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
and then if I wanted to try to clean up some easy things you can do status/needswork and !status/complex


[9/24/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
the other thing I was contemplating was the idea of dm_plans gets fuzzy for big world level pages....

for example, take Mind Flayers. I don't have any immediate plans for mind flayers, but I know I eventually want to use them as a major villian


[9/24/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I think for Ardlas, looking at the note now, I think:

(1) the main page needs to capture - at least, or perhaps preferably, as a comment - the flavor of the discussion about vibes
(2) it would be useful to review the wordbuilding stuff and pull a few minor details about who lives there
(3) it should have a minimal description of geography and bounaries to the extent the lines on the map are correct
