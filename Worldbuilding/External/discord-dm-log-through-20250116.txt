[1/3/2023 11:26 AM] .deciusmus
it is a copy I was messing around wth


[1/3/2023 11:29 AM] .deciusmus
just pushed a version with a .gitignore to untrack everything outside of worldbuilding


[1/3/2023 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
right. we need to think about organization a bit as it gets a little tricky and it works best if our directory structure are the same (e.g. it will break links in obsidian if one of us moves a file to a new directory since the links won't update)


[1/3/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
yes, agreed


[1/3/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
the above is a copy of my vault, I can throw it away


[1/3/2023 11:32 AM] .deciusmus
you should probably create the main repo and I'll fork it


[1/3/2023 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus
I think it is easier if I just give you push access to main repo, otherwise you'll always have to be submitting pull requests to merge and it gets annoying


[1/3/2023 11:32 AM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[1/3/2023 11:35 AM] .deciusmus
That makes more sense


[1/3/2023 11:35 AM] .deciusmus
You probably want the .gitignore to be 

/*
!/Worldbuilding


[1/3/2023 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
so that only the worldbuilding folder  is tracked


[1/3/2023 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, the issue is what goes in worldbuilding


[1/3/2023 11:38 AM] .deciusmus
And I guess there are two parts... What is the folder structure and what is the threshold for adding something there?


[1/3/2023 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the folder structure is pretty easy, I have roughly the same structure as you do in worldbuilding already in my main vault


[1/3/2023 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
subfolders within the main folders are a bit trickier


[1/3/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm, it seems that obsidian is actually quite smart about finding links as long as you don't change the file name itself


[1/3/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if you make a subfolder outside of obsidian and then move files around, it doesn't seem to break links


[1/3/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
as long as the filename is unique


[1/3/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
I  don't think it is that hard to agree on a folder hierarchy honestly, I like your structure basically


[1/3/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
it is more a question of what goes into worldbuilding vs not


[1/3/2023 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
right, it is more that once I have more than 10-15 notes in a top level folder I like to make a subdirectory but it is hard/impossible to predict in advance all the subdirectories, and sub-sub-directories, we might want to create


[1/3/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
but that doesn't seem to be an issue so it is just a decision about what goes into worldbuilding


[1/3/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
as you say


[1/3/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
my current top level directory structure is:
- Gods
- Historical Events
- Holidays
- Items
- NPCs
- Organizations
- PCs


[1/3/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
- Places
- Planes
- Vehicles


[1/3/2023 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
For example in your "NPCs" section it feels like most stay out of world building, but say Cha'mutte, Apollyon, and some of the fey belong in a common place


[1/3/2023 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
But the gods is probably entirely worldbuilding


[1/3/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah Gods and Historical Events can probably just move entirely to worldbuliding


[1/3/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
Holidays maybe as well


[1/3/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
and Planes


[1/3/2023 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
I have:
- NPCs
- PCs
- Worldbuilding


[1/3/2023 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus
Items, Organizations, NPCs, and Places are the trickiest


[1/3/2023 11:46 AM] .deciusmus
and then inside Worldbuilding I have:
- Cultures
- Festivals and Holidays
- Gods and Other Powers
- Legendary Places
- Organizations
- People
- Places
- Polities
- Religions
- Species
- Timeline


[1/3/2023 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
Items is maybe only 5-10% worldbuilding, but for example should the Chalice of the Runepriest or the Scepter of Command be in Worldbuilding?


[1/3/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
no, not worth it


[1/3/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
too many secrets, too campaign specific


[1/3/2023 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
okay so items are easy then


[1/3/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
I would say Items definitely keep separate


[1/3/2023 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
I would split "people" generally into NPCs (campaign specific) and People (world building)


[1/3/2023 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
or maybe Historical People


[1/3/2023 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus
I like that in theory but it is a bit tricky, e.g. Vistra Fireforge is in theory an NPC in both campaigns, yes? Or is this starting fresh and not following on from the one (ish) shot you ran


[1/3/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
realistically, with the 100-year timegap our timelines don't really care about the specific people who are currently alive, with a few rare exceptions. And some "still alive" elf or fey who is important ruler can just go in historical people


[1/3/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Vistra Fireforge is in both games, yes


[1/3/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
But does that really matter?


[1/3/2023 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus
well, if you ever go back to Tokra it would be fun to drop some stories from your campaign into this campaign via Vistra's memories


[1/3/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
true


[1/3/2023 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
much easier if I have your notes at my fingertips


[1/3/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
but maybe in those rare cases it makes sense to do something manual


[1/3/2023 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
well, what we could do is just add exceptions to our gitignore for shared NPCs


[1/3/2023 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
that should work pretty well


[1/3/2023 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
true


[1/3/2023 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
So... items and npcs typically not shared, but could be via .gitignore exception.
any world-historical figures (i.e. Cha'mutte) go in Historical Figures rather than NPCs


[1/3/2023 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
you could also add a gitignore excption for the scepter of command, if you wanted...


[1/3/2023 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
right.


[1/3/2023 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
I already have a historical figures subdir I can just move to worldbuilding/people


[1/3/2023 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
Organizations are a bit trickier


[1/3/2023 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
and then gitignore exceptions in items and npcs as needed


[1/3/2023 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
organizations and places are difficult, yes


[1/3/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
I think for different reasons though


[1/3/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
Places are tricky only in the sense of clutter


[1/3/2023 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
that is, outside of Ruins and Lairs the vast majority of your places exist in the world and would make sense in world building, it just isn't clear that it makes sense to have worldbuilding cluttered with a bunch of inns and stores and such


[1/3/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
If we keep places well organized, it is not too bad (until for example the same inn name shows up in multiple cities or something)


[1/3/2023 11:56 AM] .deciusmus
maybe for places just try it

{Reactions}
👍

[1/3/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
it could be top level but shared


[1/3/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
i.e.

PCs
NPCs
Places
WorldBuilding


[1/3/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
PCs
NPCs
Items
Places
Worldbuilding


[1/3/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
rather


[1/3/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
or actually....


[1/3/2023 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
we should agree to either https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHG3lRP0M1K4jEJ1qh6xumRopiUJ_k5nCBfewwiHZKw/edit or https://docs.google.com/document/d/1azkJiSspFQxaqGY1pYE-cN8UorwyrW69hMaxAj_zvhA/edit#heading=h.hypwvyanv8e for place organization

[1/3/2023 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
I guess that raises a question... is "Sembara" a place?


[1/3/2023 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I would call places something like Gazeteer


[1/3/2023 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
so maybe it is Gazeteer and it merges my "Polities" and "Places


[1/3/2023 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
I think places should 100% include countries, e.g. Sembara should be there


[1/3/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
I like the "Brief Geography of Taelgar" organization better


[1/3/2023 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I do as well


[1/3/2023 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
so I would call that section Gazetteer


[1/3/2023 12:02 PM] .deciusmus
So.. top level:

- Campaigns
- PCs
- NPCs
- Items
- Gazeteer
- Worldbuilding
--- Holidays and Festivals
--- Gods
--- People
--- Planes
--- History


[1/3/2023 12:02 PM] .deciusmus
missing: Organizations


[1/3/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
and I would put the immediate stuff you need to reference to run the game there - physical descriptions, layout. e.g. https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Places/Dunmar/Tokra/Tokra.html


[1/3/2023 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
right makes sense


[1/3/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I think something like Cultures, as well as Religions and Species all belong in Worldbuilding as top-level directories


[1/3/2023 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/3/2023 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure about Cultures


[1/3/2023 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
I agree on Religions and Species


[1/3/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
cultures would be for like laws/politics/traditions of various places


[1/3/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe that can just be in places


[1/3/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
or rather in gazetter


[1/3/2023 12:05 PM] .deciusmus

[1/3/2023 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
is stuff like that just part of the "Sembara" Gazeteer?


[1/3/2023 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
I think so, probably


[1/3/2023 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
no harm in having:

Gazeteer\GreenSea\GreaterSembara\Semabara\Political Organization of Sembara.md or whatever


[1/3/2023 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that's fine


[1/3/2023 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
gazetteer can be flexible, basically just a place for all the relevant current-day stuff


[1/3/2023 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
which probably eliminates the need for cultures


[1/3/2023 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i would suggest the goal be to keep notes as short as practical, though, and make overview notes with lots of links, instead of big walls of text

{Reactions}
👍

[1/3/2023 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the thing I struggle with with the google docs while running games is just finding stuff in 10,000 word documents, especially when I e.g. don't quite remember how I spelled someone's name


[1/3/2023 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
- Campaigns 
- PCs
- NPCs [ shared if needed ]
- Items [ shared if needed ]
- Vehicles
- Gazeteer [ shared, org geographically as per Brief Geography of Taelgar ]
- Worldbuilding [ shared ]
--- Holidays and Festivals
--- Gods
--- People
--- Planes
--- History
--- Religions
--- Species


[1/3/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is everything but organizations


[1/3/2023 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
two quick comments though on this - gods should just be literal gods; we can either have an "Extraplanar Powers" subdir of People, or a separate "Extraplanar Powers" top level dir for things like Archfey, Cha'mutte, and the like


[1/3/2023 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
I like Extraplanar Powers under People


[1/3/2023 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
And second I think we need a better name than Worldbuilding. Background isn't quite right


[1/3/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
worldbuilding feels too draft-y


[1/3/2023 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, with the gitignore approach it could just be top level folders


[1/3/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
that's true


[1/3/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
probably better


[1/3/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
actually, I like that, but maybe also keep worldbuliding as a place for drafts, ideas, things that might change, that sort of thing. totally freeform


[1/3/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/3/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
also for organizations, maybe roll into Gazeteer


[1/3/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
and/or NPCs


[1/3/2023 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I like have gazetteer be a strict geographical organization


[1/3/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
but for something like the Oracle of the Riven, it makes sense under the Tyrwingha Gazeteer


[1/3/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
and for the Rangers, it makes sense under Greater Sembara, right?


[1/3/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
and for stuff like the Deno'qai tribes, wouldn't that also make sense under the Gazeteer


[1/3/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the Deno'qai tribes would make sense in a Gazetteer as they are tied to specific places


[1/3/2023 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but something like the Fraternity of the Empty Moon is harder to place


[1/3/2023 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/3/2023 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Organizations is useful


[1/3/2023 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
maybe just a top level Organizations that starts unshared, and we can opt in for large scale organizations that should be shared


[1/3/2023 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but probably mostly for kind of more campaign-specific stuff, like NPCs

{Reactions}
👍

[1/3/2023 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I would say Gazetteer should generally be descriptions of places specifically, but can include details like political organization and culture of specific places. and some history may leak in, too, although in general it is probably better to make a separate note for e.g. "history of tokra" in the History/Dunmar section

{Reactions}
👍

[1/3/2023 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
for the history section, I'd like to keep things as short as possible and try to focus most of the notes on specific events, for the reason that it eventually makes something like this possible: https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines

[1/3/2023 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I am going to clone your repo, merge the worldbuilding stuff and reorganize my notes, and then push the md files (with comments stripped) to github and send you the link and push permission


[1/3/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
ok


[1/3/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
if you give me 5 min I have a few tweaks based on this conversation


[1/3/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
okay


[1/3/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
i'll reorganize my local vault first and then incorporate your stuff


[1/3/2023 12:33 PM] .deciusmus
pushed


[1/3/2023 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
the gitignore is a bit anoying but pushed something that adds vistra fireforge


[1/3/2023 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
the gitignore isn't great because it will break if I move where vistra is


[1/3/2023 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to find a better way


[1/3/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I looked for a few min and couldn't find a better way


[1/3/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
you could do **/Vistra Fireforge.md but I think you still need to open up the folders via !folder


[1/3/2023 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
working on other things and email. but almost have comment cleaning working and will push main repo shortly for you to test

[1/3/2023 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
if you clone it, make a few edits, and push them back I can test my "sync from remote" workflow


[1/3/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
the gitignore doesnt work for vistra


[1/3/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't get her in my sync


[1/3/2023 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
oops yeah that is the wrong gitignore


[1/3/2023 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
must have messed it up switching branchces


[1/3/2023 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
there are still things kind of broken with my comment removal code and the gitignore


[1/3/2023 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I am going to fiddle a bit but might need to delete the repo and start again


[1/3/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
ack it went away on me 😦


[1/3/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
I had some updates I was going to push


[1/3/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah my comment removal code is broken and I have to start again


[1/3/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
meaning it kept comments?


[1/3/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
my code removed all comments but then the comments from the untracked files cannot be restored by switching branches because they are untracked


[1/3/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so I need to figure out a different way


[1/3/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
you should still be able to push once I put the repo back


[1/3/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
but first I have to restore all my old notes from my backup to get back my comments


[1/3/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
ok


[1/3/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
just making sure I shouldn't delete my local repo because it was full of juicy secrets 🙂


[1/3/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
you can try just searching for %% and see


[1/3/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
just don't read anything if you find some comments


[1/3/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
no comments


[1/3/2023 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
there might be comments in the commit history


[1/3/2023 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but those are kind of hard to accidentally stumble upon


[1/3/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/3/2023 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
I think using git -f to force add something that is in gitignore will work better than anything else


[1/3/2023 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
this is way more complicated than I thought, I think there are subtle weirdness coming from git + icloud


[1/3/2023 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
the issue is switching branches, right?


[1/3/2023 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
it is a weird filename issue when there are odd characters in the file name


[1/3/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I need to a) get a list of files with comments and b) check to see if each one is tracked


[1/3/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
then only remove comments from tracked files


[1/3/2023 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but the filenames that git ls-tree reports are not what grep likes for things with odd characters


[1/3/2023 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
just had to do it in the reverse order, git check-ignore is okay with file names reported by grep "%%"


[1/3/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
okay I think I have it


[1/3/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
not quite


[1/3/2023 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
looks like it is working now


[1/3/2023 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
the repo on github is clean and I just gave you push access again


[1/3/2023 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
once you push some changes I'll test my pull workflow


[1/3/2023 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
ok... my git repo and yours now have divergent history and I can't merge...


[1/3/2023 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
let me futz for a bit


[1/3/2023 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
you can just delete your .git directory and reinitalize, probably


[1/3/2023 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
or you might be able to rebase


[1/3/2023 4:47 PM] .deciusmus
yeah "futz" was shorthand for rebasing 🙂


[1/3/2023 4:47 PM] .deciusmus
I do work with git in my day job


[1/3/2023 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
a lot of conflicts though...


[1/3/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
c:\Users\msackton\personal\OneDrive\taelgar>git push
remote: Permission to tsackton/taelgar.git denied to msackton.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403


[1/3/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
duh


[1/3/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
accept the invitation before pushing


[1/3/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
ok, pushed


[1/3/2023 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
it was a big set of changes


[1/3/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
how did you get items in there, I don't see anything in gitignore


[1/3/2023 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
git add -f


[1/3/2023 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
you don't need git ignore


[1/3/2023 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
its much easier


[1/3/2023 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
basically, if we change the gitignore to ignore NPCs and Items and Organizations


[1/3/2023 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
you can overwrite it with

git add -f <file>


[1/3/2023 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
then once that file is tracked it stays tracked


[1/3/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
a bigger issue is there isn't an obvious way to merge changes back into vault, since any merge will by default delete all my comments


[1/3/2023 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
*my vault


[1/3/2023 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not sure that this will actually work in practice, or at least not how I currently have it set up


[1/3/2023 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
a merge shouldn't delete your comments


[1/3/2023 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
just do a git checkout secret_branch


[1/3/2023 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
git merge origin/main


[1/3/2023 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/3/2023 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
that will delete comments in files where I removed comments before pushing to main


[1/3/2023 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/3/2023 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
hrm


[1/3/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
this is like deep git stuff


[1/3/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
So... here is one possible solution which might be a bit of a pain to implement....


[1/3/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
use smudge and clean filters


[1/3/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
You'd have to have a program/script that would:

* Read the file
* Replace %%SECRET NOTES FILENAME%% with the contents of secrets\filename

And a second one that would:
* read the file
* Replace 
%% SECRET NOTES 
stuff
%%
* with the %%SECRET NOTES FILENAME%% and write the stuff it was replacing to secrets\filename


[1/3/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
then make the first program the smudge filter - this runs on checkout


[1/3/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
then make the second program the clean filter - this runs on checkin


[1/3/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
I *think* you'd end up not really noticing the secrets


[1/3/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
folder, I mean (which wouldn't be shared)


[1/3/2023 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm that might not actually be that bad

Using git clean filters to remove local path information. | Jim Hester
Error messages in many programming languages (including R) often have the full paths to files included in the error message. (e.g. “/Users/jhester/projects/pkgname/R/pkg.R”). This feature is very helpful when working with a package locally as it makes it easy to find exactly what file has an issue. However if these errors are included in documen...

[1/3/2023 5:40 PM] .deciusmus
for an example


[1/3/2023 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
[filter "p4"]
    clean = git-p4-filter --clean %f
    smudge = git-p4-filter --smudge %f


[1/3/2023 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
as an example


[1/3/2023 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
so you could have a save-secrets.pl and restore-secrets.pl


[1/3/2023 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
clean = save-secrets %f


[1/3/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
it gets invoked with the filename as the %f and then is given the file to be committed on stdin and writes what it wants to stdout


[1/3/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
smudge is the opposite


[1/3/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
it is given the repo file on stdin and adds what is written to stdout to the working tree


[1/3/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
i need to get my head around how it saves file-specific secrets


[1/3/2023 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
all the examples I can find are like sed -e 's/com.blah.user-thing/com.blah.user-bnr/'


[1/3/2023 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
whereas I need to replace %%(secret text)%% with %%(unique key)%% and then replace %%(unique key)%% with %%(secret text)%%


[1/3/2023 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information

// invoke with secret-filter %f mysecretsdir -- written to assume all filenames are unique

string? nextLine;

{
    nextLine = Console.ReadLine();
    if (nextLine == null) break;

[1/3/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't have to be a unique key

[1/3/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
chat gpt is translated your nasty C# to pretty Python for me


[1/3/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
😂


[1/3/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
haha


[1/3/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
don't know if it works, to be honest


[1/3/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
need to go make dinner rather than testing


[1/3/2023 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is a little tricky because comments can span multiple lines


[1/3/2023 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
the code above just keeps reading until it gets %% on its own line


[1/3/2023 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
or EOF


[1/3/2023 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
you have to start with

%% SECRET NOTES


[1/3/2023 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
but

%% SECRET NOTES

It turns out the rangers are actually evil

%%


[1/3/2023 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
write but sometimes there are comments that are embedded in a string and you. need to just trim %% (text) %%


[1/3/2023 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
I can rewrite with proper regexs, that is not too bad


[1/3/2023 8:00 PM] rsulfuratus
works!


[1/3/2023 8:00 PM] .deciusmus
cool


[1/3/2023 8:00 PM] rsulfuratus
nice find


[1/3/2023 8:00 PM] .deciusmus
I was just about to try to get my version working


[1/3/2023 8:00 PM] .deciusmus
with the hacky code I gave you above, it only works if you have 1 secret note at most per file


[1/3/2023 8:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i track multiple secrets per file with regex groups


[1/3/2023 8:01 PM] rsulfuratus
only thing is it doesn't seem to be working for the file you added with git add -f


[1/3/2023 8:02 PM] rsulfuratus
works when I add it too


[1/3/2023 8:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but it might be easier to just modify .gitignore


[1/3/2023 8:03 PM] rsulfuratus
also, for the autogenerated html, it is much nicer if you use an actual header (with # or ##) instead of relying on the filename


[1/3/2023 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
since the html generation can't add the filename as h1


[1/3/2023 8:04 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/3/2023 8:04 PM] .deciusmus
that is why you have the headers everywhere


[1/3/2023 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/3/2023 8:04 PM] .deciusmus
i'll make sure to add them in


[1/3/2023 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
if you go to 'apperance -> advanced' and uncheck 'show inline title' in obsidian


[1/3/2023 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
you'll see how it will look on the generated html


[1/3/2023 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
also, the one thing with my filter is that if you add secrets it gets testy, since I don't have the secrets to fill in


[1/3/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I can probably fix that so the restore function ignores incoming files with actual comments and not %%SECRET[1]%%


[1/3/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
actually, I think you might need to use the same filter, since if you push something with a secret to main, and then I do something to it and push changes, my filters will remove your secret


[1/3/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
I dont care about secrets


[1/3/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
I assume:

%% GM Note: sss %%


[1/3/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
will not be touched


[1/3/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
or are you saying it tries to treat all %% as secrets?


[1/3/2023 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
no that will disappear too, my filter replaces all Obsidian comments with %%SECRET[1]%%


[1/3/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/3/2023 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I could change that so that secrets always start %%SECRET


[1/3/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
that isn't super ideal, it would be nicer if it replaced only %% Secret


[1/3/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
or if it is easier, so that it didn't replace %%Shared Note


[1/3/2023 8:15 PM] rsulfuratus
right now I only have about 25-30 notes with secrets so it is probably easiest if I just make all secrets start %%SECRET


[1/3/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
either way


[1/3/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
I don't have any plans to push comments in public files in the next week or two anyway


[1/3/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
I am planning on pushing some %% in some NPC files to keep info out of the html for players


[1/3/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
fyi, you trashed my update to at least one file (the festival of the micracle of the mists)


[1/3/2023 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
oh, hmm. not sure how that happened


[1/3/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
it looks like somehow I erased your commits after "minor sembara updates"


[1/3/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
actually that's not right


[1/3/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
it does look like Vistra got reverted as well


[1/3/2023 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is just Vistra and the Festival


[1/3/2023 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I fixed it


[1/3/2023 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i got my filter working to just remove %%SECRET


[1/3/2023 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
as long as your comments don't start %%SECRET they should just pass through untouched

I have to focus on work for most of the rest of the day, but... If you are not using "folder notes" for your html publish workflow you should be. It makes clicking on the node in the tree open the the articled named after the node


[1/4/2023 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. if you have a folder called Tokra and a file inside the folder called Tokra, rather than having the tokra folder expand and the tokra note be inside the folder, clicking tokra just opens the folder and shows the tokra file

You might need to pip update to the master branch from github


[1/4/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
they guy fixed a bug or two recently in the folder notes


[1/4/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
you can see it in action here https://msackton.github.io/taelgar1650/


[1/4/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
I'm fixing the gazeteer before I go back to york, but try to not break it again -- all of the duplicate places in "worldbuilding\places_to_move" are messing up the internal links


[1/4/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
so the chronicle of sembaran history is linked to the dead stuff in places to move rather than the gazeteer


[1/4/2023 11:19 AM] rsulfuratus
if you merge instead of delete it will merge links


[1/4/2023 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus
i pushed a gazeeteer reorg (following the doc) so pull that before you clean up


[1/4/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
I tested on a few files but if you are doing this systematically i will toss my changes so as not to mess anything up


[1/4/2023 11:26 AM] .deciusmus
I just fixed it all


[1/4/2023 11:26 AM] .deciusmus
I pulled first


[1/4/2023 11:26 AM] .deciusmus
am pushing my fix


[1/4/2023 11:26 AM] rsulfuratus
okay I'll revert my changes to avoid merge conflicts


[1/4/2023 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
pushed


[1/4/2023 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
the only place stll in "places to move" is Drankorian Empire as I wasn't sure where to put it


[1/4/2023 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
central lowlands, I'll move it


[1/4/2023 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm going to add brief descriptions outlining the bounds of each region today. but have a lot of email to deal with and also trying to wrap up delwath story so doing it on and off


[1/4/2023 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
Your git commit message hygine is pretty bad 😄


[1/4/2023 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, might isn't amazing, but still


[1/4/2023 2:20 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I know. pretty much the only time I use git for collaborate we have the main branch locked and I write good pull requests and then rebase to squash all the messy commits


[1/4/2023 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, are you attached to preserving the google docs?


[1/4/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
For Sembara at least, i was thinking of deleting from the google doc once I pushed stuff into Gazeeteer


[1/4/2023 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
ultimately I do want to move the entire world bible directory to obsidian, I'm not sure what the benefit of deleting stuff is?


[1/4/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
well, for the sembara doc, it helps me remember what I've done


[1/4/2023 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
ah I see, delete the text as you go.


[1/4/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
given I'm doing things in bits and pieces


[1/4/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/4/2023 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
for now can you just strikethough the sections you move? should be nearly as fast as deleting and pretty obvious


[1/4/2023 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
yup

what do you think of this:

[1/4/2023 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
its a mermaid chart form of family tree


[1/4/2023 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
I kinda like having the categories on the graph in color. Not sure having the words clickable really matters, the links are right there on the page


[1/4/2023 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
mostly I was playing around with how to make family trees because it is alot easier to do it in mermaid than as images, I find


[1/4/2023 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
But I can revert the dunmari one if you don't like it (or use styles to re-add the colors)


[1/4/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus

yeah I think for general purpose family trees where ones don't exist it is nice to have that option, I'd just not bother replacing existing stuff. if you could make it look more like a traditional family tree (without the weird nameless squares representing parental relationships) it would be nicer too, I think. it just looks a bit weird to me.


[1/4/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
no way to do it without the weird nameless squares at the moment

btw, if either of us renames a page, we should try to keep the old name as an alias, otherwise you risk breaking links to session notes and other non-shared stuff (the old links become orphans). i am looking for ways to find all orphan links now, which would allow you to create them and then merge the ones that exist (which would fix linking issues)

there is a plugin called "dangling links" that is seems to work to list all dangling links. fixing a bunch now

pulling up a lot of typos


[1/4/2023 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I pushed a commit that fixes dangling links, but you should check that it doesn't mess up anything on your end (e.g., a link you had to a file that wasn't shared, which is now broken).


[1/4/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I was pretty indiscriminate but would be easy to be careful to only fix broken links that are obviously wrong or which point to a renamed file

[1/4/2023 10:28 PM] .deciusmus
Also one of my players is asking about the difference between the Wildling and the Wrydling, I pushed a few changes... basically making the wildling about nature and the wrydling about chaos of humanity/human spirit/inward-mental type things (as well as giving the wrydling care over transgender people, which seems to fit, and my group is very queer so I'm trying to make an effort to highlight queer-forward stuff)


[1/4/2023 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is consistent with my docs, I think? the wyrdling is kind of a combination of the Bastard from the Curse of Chalion books and the Norns/Fates type gods from Greek/Norse myths


[1/4/2023 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
the wildling is really kind of the generic nature diety


[1/4/2023 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I had a whole abbey of the wyrdling in the Chasa river valley you never went to that fleshed this out a bit.


[1/4/2023 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Solas Abbey

The building is reminiscent of some Tuscan abbeys, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Sant%27Antimo. Sits above the river on a downslope of a hill, near a minor tributary. 

While no longer occupied by a religious order, the structure itself is relatively intact, although most of the outbuildings are gone. The original chapel of the Wyrdling remains well-kept, and the current occupant has established quarters in the old chapter room. 

A large statue of the Wyrdling in human form, depicted as a two-faced jester, one male, one female, and both with inscrutable expressions dominates the inside of the chapel. The walls are plain stone, but there are three large stained glass windows which depict: a large thunderstorm that looks like it is being held back by a rainbow; a group of children being fed by apples plucked from the sky by a creature that looks like a satyr; a person being hugged by what look like arms of wind, and an evil spirit flying out of them. 

There is a strange feeling about the place, not exactly a sense of peace but a sense of belonging. Whatever doubts you might feel about yourself, your place in the world, you feel like someone hears them and cares. 

The abbey is currently occupied by a lone hermit/priest, who goes by Mel. 

This is a safe place to rest - shadow hunters cannot get here.


[1/4/2023 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus
Mel
Nonbinary Chardonian, priest of the Wyrdling, lives in Solas Abbey

Description: An middle aged person, maybe in their late 40s or early 50s, but has a kind of ageless look. Smooth, rounded face, short cropped hair, ambiguously gendered features.

Mannerisms: Slow and deliberate in everything. Likes to listen before speaking.

Game purpose: Provide a safe place to rest and recover. Possible info-dump, healing resources.


[1/4/2023 10:36 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that all fits with my (minor) changes


[1/4/2023 10:36 PM] .deciusmus
It is quite consistent with what I was thinking, but some of the overview material I think didn't highlight as much


[1/4/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. the one thing I might want to keep is having weather associated with the wyrdling, not the wildling, playing up the association with chance/luck/fate and storms. which also indirectly makes the wyrdling a sort of alternate patron of sailors of a sort


[1/4/2023 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
I liked having the weather with the wildling


[1/4/2023 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
but it could move..


[1/4/2023 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
maybe the wyrdling is associated with the effect of the weather, whereas the wildling is associated with the weather itself


[1/4/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
that isn't explained that well... But the wildling seems like the one who would be associated with a major storm or whatever, the divine who is tied to the changing of the seasons and the monsoon and things like that


[1/4/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think I see what you are saying


[1/4/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
the wyrdling though might be associated with the luck of the wind, the chance of rain; the one sailors pray to for good winds


[1/4/2023 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus
if the monsoon rains don't come you worry that you offended the wilding; if you want good weather for your wedding day you make an offering to wyrdling


[1/4/2023 10:41 PM] .deciusmus
right, exactly


[1/4/2023 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that the Eight Divines are generally pretty impersonal and abstract, since it fits with the kind of Drankorian feeling. but I also think it is nice to have some that play against type so to speak and the wyrdling seems a good candidate. also contrasts with the very impersonal sense of the wildling as nature writ large


[1/4/2023 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
the sibyl and maybe the wanderer also might have that kind of more personal feeling, with the mother, the father, and the wildling as the most vast and impersonal


[1/4/2023 10:50 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I like that


[1/4/2023 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
I have one player who is a paladin of the wanderer and one who is a trickster domain fey-curious priest of the wyrdling from Tyrwingha


[1/4/2023 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
So these are going to come up a lot


[1/5/2023 8:22 AM] .deciusmus
I’m reconsidering whether 100 years is the right time distance between my game and “mainline” Taelgar…


[1/5/2023 8:24 AM] .deciusmus
There are some advantages but it also makes things in this shared obsidian notes world a bit harder and less synergistic…
- it’s a but awkward on things like sembaran royalty as either the doc just stops in 1650, leaving a weird ~100 year gap, or alternatively the site for my players has all kinds of weird future history


[1/5/2023 8:27 AM] .deciusmus
If that was the only problem, I’d just live with it, but it also seems a shame to not be able to reasonably share little things. i.e. if my game ends up in Tokra, it was a pretty different place 100 years ago… if our game ends up in Clenseau, or Embry, or other places like that where I will have made up a bunch of small details… harder for you to reuse


[1/5/2023 8:28 AM] .deciusmus
(Although I noticed that you reused the last inn in delwaths scry — I assume that’s where Marcella is…)


[1/5/2023 8:40 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is where Marcella is


[1/5/2023 8:42 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure what the best time gap is, though


[1/5/2023 8:42 AM] .deciusmus
I can’t really decide if there is a downside to setting my game say in 1738


[1/5/2023 8:43 AM] .deciusmus
Other than having to rejigger some plot around the lich


[1/5/2023 8:44 AM] .deciusmus
Or even 1745 or something like that so it would eventually catch up


[1/5/2023 8:45 AM] rsulfuratus
I think it kind of depends a little on what your long term plot / campaign structure is


[1/5/2023 8:46 AM] rsulfuratus
if you end up going to Sembara in the Dunmar campaign, I don't necessarily want it to be in the middle of some major crisis


[1/5/2023 8:48 AM] rsulfuratus
if I remember the backstory right you have some complicated sembaran politics and the lich ruling over the kingdom....I'd prefer that not be happening concurrently with our game


[1/5/2023 8:49 AM] rsulfuratus
sembara in 1748 has throughout our game been a place that seems safe and stable - wellby left because it was boring, marcella is running there because it is safe, etc.


[1/5/2023 8:52 AM] rsulfuratus
but a 20-30 year gap might make more sense than a 100 year gap, basically a generation ago


[1/5/2023 8:56 AM] .deciusmus
So the very-high-level campaign arc is:

Levels 1-6: Set in Clenseau, mostly small episodic things, potentially several years of game-time. During this period a lich is secretly ruling Sembara.
Level 7: The party finds out the lich has been defeated (although they don't have anything to do with it). They end up saving the life of the new ruler (currently expected to be Elaine II) when she is touring the kingdom on a royal circuit
Level 8-14: They get called to court and various people approach them with problems. These at some point lead to a discovery (currently expected to be in the western marches) that the lich is actually still alive and is in a complicated struggle with some mind flayers. They party goes to various old haunts of the lich (Tollen, highland kingdoms) to find details about his past (ala the horocruxes in Harry Potter) and eventually defeats him.
Level 14+ Unclear, but likely somehow related to the Far Realms


[1/5/2023 8:57 AM] .deciusmus
The intention is for the level 7+ stuff to be set during a peaceful period of recovery in Sembara. The lich<->mindflayer struggle is taking place deep in the underdark/on the fringes of civilization, not in the halls of power or farmlands of Sembara


[1/5/2023 8:58 AM] rsulfuratus
right. and I have no real interest or intention on adding an underdark arc to our Dunmar campaign, so that works well


[1/5/2023 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
I think I would just like the "oh crap a lich was secretly ruling Sembara" plot to have some distance from the present


[1/5/2023 9:01 AM] .deciusmus
So maybe the lich is defeated in say, the early 1720s?


[1/5/2023 9:01 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I was wondering if it would work for you and your players to have a substantial time skip, like 10 years, in the middle of your campaign


[1/5/2023 9:01 AM] .deciusmus
Actually, several of them asked for that


[1/5/2023 9:02 AM] .deciusmus
the guy who is playing the orphan kid with the far realm patron was hoping for a longer time jump than I was planning orignally


[1/5/2023 9:02 AM] .deciusmus
his original vision was the kid was like, 8 or 9 at the beginning of the game and in his 20s by the level 8-14 stuff


[1/5/2023 9:03 AM] rsulfuratus
so you could do part 1 (lich ruling secretly) in the 1720s, and then jump ~15 years for the 8-14 stuff to have that happen say 5-10 years before the Dunmar campaign


[1/5/2023 9:05 AM] rsulfuratus
really there is no need to decide the time skip now, right? our dunmar campaign might be over by the time you get to level 8. i'm kind of expecting another ~2 - 2 1/2 years for the dunmar campaign given the pace of leveling so far


[1/5/2023 9:05 AM] rsulfuratus
but something like a 15 year jump from the lich time to the "approximately current" time could work well


[1/5/2023 9:07 AM] .deciusmus
yeah; I'm expecting the 1-6 stuff to take ~1 - 1.5 years of real life. I have 6 "episodes" planned each with 1-3 (mostly 2) sessions, and basically leveling after each one. But we will probably only play 10 times in 2023, so finishing that will likely spill into 2024


[1/5/2023 9:08 AM] .deciusmus
The main thing is I need to know if I'm planning a more significant time jump, to let my players plan starting ages and character arcs a bit


[1/5/2023 9:10 AM] .deciusmus
let me noodle around a bit


[1/5/2023 9:10 AM] .deciusmus
How committed are you to Arryn II and Derik VI's regnal years?


[1/5/2023 9:11 AM] rsulfuratus
Arryn III? I think only shows up in Wellby backstory dates, so really doesn't matter


[1/5/2023 9:11 AM] .deciusmus
sorry, I mean Arryn III


[1/5/2023 9:11 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, only shows up as dates in Wellby's backstory. doesn't matter at all


[1/5/2023 9:12 AM] .deciusmus
Wellby would have been around in Sembara when the lich was alive, right?


[1/5/2023 9:12 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, I think he'd be a kid? I'm not actually sure how old Wellby was


[1/5/2023 9:12 AM] .deciusmus
*is


[1/5/2023 9:12 AM] rsulfuratus
Wellby was born 1722


[1/5/2023 9:14 AM] rsulfuratus
he is basically pippin


[1/5/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
but actually it works well for Wellby's backstory to have Sembara be in a bit of chaos in his early childhood, as his family was mostly at sea and then settled into a boring routine recently, in the 1740s


[1/5/2023 9:26 AM] rsulfuratus
on a separate topic, do you have any idea why images aren't showing up in the github.io pages? I checked both yours and mine


[1/5/2023 9:26 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/The%20Central%20Highlands%20Region/Zarkandur.html


[1/5/2023 9:26 AM] rsulfuratus
https://msackton.github.io/taelgar1650/Gazetteer/The%20Central%20Highlands%20Region/Zarkandur.html


[1/5/2023 9:27 AM] rsulfuratus
but the Zarkandur image is in both of our repos


[1/5/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
no idea why but by fiddling around I figured out that if I rename the _media folder to something that doesn't start with an underscore, it works. so I have images in assets now


[1/5/2023 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, I saw the same thing


[1/5/2023 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
I assume some default filter on _


[1/5/2023 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
I was going to try renaming but hadn't gotten to it


[1/5/2023 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
Here is my revamped Sembaran royal line:

* Cece I, the great queen who ruled over a long peaceful era reigned 1652 - 1712
* She was unlucky with children; none survived to suceed her exceed Robert I, reigned 1712 - 1722
* Robert was actually replaced by the lich in 1719

After Robert / the lich dies, a cadet branch of the house takes over, starting with:
* Elaine II (reigned 1722 - 1745)
* followed by her second son, Arryn III (reigned 1745 - ??)


[1/5/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
this retcons only the name of the monarch of sembara when Wellby was born (switched from Derik VII to Elaine II) and when Arryn III began his reign


[1/5/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Elaine II is intentionally meant to call back to Cece I and represent a "rebirth of long era of peace and prospertity"


[1/5/2023 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
and Arryn III presumably follows in his mother's footsteps in that regard, keeping present day Sembara quiet and well-ruled


[1/5/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
the only other big impact is that I like having Cece I be the one who ends the hobgoblin wars, and for some of the western marches to be still war-scarred in my campaign. So this moves some hobgoblin campaigns int he western marches from the 1590s to the 1660s


[1/5/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
I dunno if that disrupts anything elsewhere in the world


[1/5/2023 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus
so the general grand sweep of things is that cha'mutte had these huge armies in the north, and when he dies all the magic that sustains their logistics falls apart, and so a great host (led by a dragon conclave, and consisting of hobgoblins, trolls, giants, etc) sweeps south from Pandar. this is what destroys most of the pre-Great War polities in the west, and forges Chardon into an empire. the advance is stopped outside of Chardon in the 1550s (so maybe a ~7 year war), and then there is probably two decades of reconquest and resettlement as Chardonian forces move north; perhaps this goes in a few pulses, with some gaps, the timeline is not exactly clear (except that the current northernmost border city, Voltara is only about ~50 years old, so must have been founded around 1700).


[1/5/2023 11:10 AM] rsulfuratus
the original idea was that the remnant hobgoblins who survive Chardon flee into the mountains, east and south, and emerge as threats to sembara in the 1580s-1590s, and Dunmar in the 1600-1610, with both countries largely peaceful by the 1620s


[1/5/2023 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
but this is not canon anywhere - I can't change the Dunmar timeline but the Sembara timeline is not introduced in play anywhere (except as a retconned date for the stone titan one shot in Dunmore, but that could happen at any time and was self-contained that shifting the date around doesn't matter)


[1/5/2023 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus
so you could easily have: Chardon defeats dragon conclave, hobgoblins scatter; some regroup in the northern parts of Dunmar and there is a war there in the 1600s, but hobgoblins are defeated and scatter again. in the 1640s or whenever, a new hobgoblin leader arises who starts to attract recruits and settlers, and a new threat grows


[1/5/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
the only other thing is the history beats that outline the dissolution of greater sembara into the various modern day pieces work well now. so that means either stretching out the chaos in sembara for an extra 50 years (meaning the "blood years" run roughly from 1545-1565 in the west, 1545-1610 in Dunmar, and 1545-1660 in Sembara), or inserting another peaceful interlude in the middle that is disrupted again by the new hobgoblin frontier (which means the fortifications of the marches would have probably happened prior to Cece, but there would still be the scars of the second war)


[1/5/2023 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
What about something like the following...

1550s: Hobgoblins stopped near Chardon
1580s: Hobgoblins pushed over the mountains towards Sembara; hobgoblin war in Sembara
1580s-1600: Hobgoblins driven back by a series of weak rulers, but not crushed. 
1600s-1610: Hobgoblins move towards Dunmar and defeated badly in Dunmar
1610s - 1640s: Chardon and Dunmar peaceful. A stalemate of sorts in Sembara some significant reserves of hobgoblins both in the southern mountains (around where the March of Andonne is now) and the eastern edges of the Crimson Forest and the elderwood
1650ish: a new leader arises amongst these hobgoblins and sweeps into Sembara from the west and south, devasting the areas in the southwest
1650s: Cece comes to the throne, a young queen of just barely 20, facing this hobgoblin onslaught, and gains a reptuation as Derik III reborn by basically winning a series of decisive victories, heralding effectively a century of peace in Sembara


[1/5/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think the basic outline works. the exact details of where hobgoblins are in between wars probably doesn't matter for the moment. but the new leader arising among the hobgoblins turning what is basically a long-term frozen conflict with little actual fighting into a serious war works well


[1/5/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
you could have sort of a vikings in england from 850-1000 kind of vibe


[1/5/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
Here is my new regnal list:

Cece I
Robert I

House of Lils (1720s - present)
Elaine II
Arryn III


[1/5/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
it retcons the ruler in Wellby's background to be Elaine II when he is born


[1/5/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
and retcons the year Arryn III came to the throne although he is still the kind


[1/5/2023 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
put it in notes and I'll update the links in Wellby's background, which I'm sure Schwartz will never notice

has a ton of probably ugly javascript to make it relatively clean even if info is not filled in in the metadata.


[1/7/2023 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus
will not auto-update, so if you update metadata have to reinsert template, but with hotkeys that is pretty simple


[1/7/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
i haven't played around with templates is there a 2 sentence "how to"


[1/7/2023 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
you should be able to just pull my templates from the repo. so you just need install the templater plugin, and then you'll get a button on the sidebar to insert templater templates - just adds the text in the template at your cursor location


[1/7/2023 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
you can make hotkeys to insert a particular templater template in settings


[1/7/2023 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
the yaml frontmatter template has to go at the top of the file, of course, and the npc-header template is designed to immediately follow, but reads the yaml frontmatter to construct text, so you need to fill in the yaml metadata first


[1/7/2023 11:38 AM] .deciusmus
i see


[1/7/2023 11:43 AM] .deciusmus
The current year is wrong for me of course 🙂

[1/7/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
but will need a way to keep that from being constantly reverted back and forth in the repo...


[1/7/2023 11:44 AM] .deciusmus
if you install the fantasy calendar plugin, we can use its API to get the current date


[1/7/2023 11:44 AM] .deciusmus
then the ages will update as you move "today" in the calendar


[1/7/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
ah that is perfect


[1/7/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
so we can both define today locally


[1/7/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
great


[1/7/2023 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus
how do you import a fantasy calendar calendar to obsidian? do you have a tl;dr? I just installed the plugin


[1/7/2023 11:46 AM] .deciusmus
I just created one


[1/7/2023 11:46 AM] .deciusmus
I didn’t use the website


[1/7/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
There is a settings wheel once you import it where you can just define a calendar


[1/7/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
Ie set the months, weeks, intercalendary days, leap years, moon phases, etc


[1/7/2023 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
right. i spent a while calibrating the moon in taelgar


[1/7/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
but I should be able to copy the settings


[1/7/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
cycle 29.5 shift -15


[1/7/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
I should probably use the same moon settings as you


[1/7/2023 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah. the moon can't change since all the dates of werewolf events and festivals depend on it


[1/7/2023 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
what do you think of "starday, sunday, moonsday, lightsday, waterday, godsday, freeday" for days of the week? close enough to sat/sun/mon/tues/wed/thurs/fri for understandability

{Reactions}
👍

[1/7/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm going to use those for now but easy enough to change. more difficult is the months, although may change those too at some point


[1/7/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
also taelgar has no leap days. someday if we revise the months might add some intercalary days but they would be fixed every year.


[1/7/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
It’s really easy to get the template working with current year


[1/7/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
Plus the last updated can be an i game year


[1/7/2023 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
was just looking at that, tl;dr?


[1/7/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
assume it is just putting a fantasy calendar api call in the templater code


[1/7/2023 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
here is a separate weird issue, maybe you have a thought. whenever I pull your changes, either secrets filter or something else is making it so that all the files are just pulled also have untracked changes in my index. but i haven't touched them


[1/7/2023 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at diffs, it seems to be something about newlines.


[1/7/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
ah I think I know


[1/7/2023 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
I’m out with Z but I can send you the JavaScript in an hour or so


[1/7/2023 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus

[1/7/2023 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
can you send the JavaScript for fantasy calendar api? or just push your edits?


[1/7/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus

[1/7/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
also any other metadata fields it would be nice to have to NPCs/People? i am going to update a bunch tonight/tomorrow so want to kind of finalize this setup. 

I have affiliations, but that is more for making org lists with dataview in organization pages, and it isn't really universal.


[1/7/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
the location stuff could perhaps be hierarchical, e.g. 
location->region, location->settlement


[1/7/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I think things like appearance, personality, role playing quirks, motivations/goals are better not automated


[1/7/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway if you have ideas for format or other information let me know. once I do 100 NPCs information won't really want to change things


[1/7/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
I like the callout


[1/7/2023 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
For rulers I thought having a regnal years would be good and perhaps children


[1/7/2023 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
But I’d do that as a separate template


[1/7/2023 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not sure there is much point in gender you could just have pronouns


[1/7/2023 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah things like rulers and gods can get their own specific template


[1/7/2023 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
agree can probably dump gender. i have it set up to autogenerate pronouns from gender unless there is pronouns set, so e.g. you could have someone female (she/they)


[1/7/2023 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
but no point in printing gender in header, i agree.


[1/7/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I turned off your code to auto-generate links to locations, because for example there are some NPCs whose current location is "somewhere in Dunmar" or "east of Karawa in the blasted plains" and it is kind of annoying to have those generic locations get auto-tagged


[1/7/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
which is why I was thinking of adding more granularity to location, but not sure it is worth the effort. would mostly be for dataview autotables


[1/8/2023 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
major reorg on the 'reorg' branch, see commit notes for details. want feedback before merging though, but no rush


[1/9/2023 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
this is basically the org that current taelgarverse site is using?


[1/9/2023 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/9/2023 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
I like it


[1/9/2023 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
I may need to come up with a better way to handle divergence between 1719 and 1748 for people, but this won't impact that


[1/9/2023 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
(For example, I don't want Robert I's death date to be visible to my PCs)


[1/9/2023 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah the NPC info is a bit tricky to make seemless. there is probably some way to make the basic info block be regenerated


[1/9/2023 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
I don't really need it seemless because I don't plan on exposing the general folder


[1/9/2023 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
but for specific NPCs that appear in both places and where the details matter, I probably need a solution


[1/9/2023 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
One comment would be the PC folder, it might make sense to split it by campaign


[1/9/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I was debating the PC folder. especially because it is currently a bit unwieldy with all the guest players, but also because I was going to add Mawar and Isaac's Great Library campaign


[1/9/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
I like having it shared


[1/9/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
that part is fine. But I might want to only publish in the sidebar the pcs from my game


[1/9/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah probably having PCs split into subdirs by campaign would make it simplest


[1/9/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/9/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
also with the shared people folder we are much more likely to come across name clashes


[1/9/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
that just makes the world more realistic


[1/9/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
But I think that is probably relatively easy to handle either via folders or (from XXX) or whatever to distinguish


[1/9/2023 12:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, the name clashes should exist. My Sembaran royal family has lots of them


[1/9/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I already have one name clash from the Deno'qai, there are two Zevi's


[1/9/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I just add "of the" or "from"


[1/9/2023 12:29 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that works


[1/9/2023 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
Feel free to merge your reorg btw when you get a chance


[1/9/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
okay


[1/9/2023 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
I'm about to go grab lunch but then I'm going to spend a bit of time adding NPCs from my first session last night


[1/9/2023 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
okay let me merge reorg to main now then


[1/9/2023 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that would be good


[1/9/2023 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
The one problem with shared NPCs is stuff like this:

[1/9/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
A lot of dead links there for me, and some back link weirdness if end up with a session 28


[1/9/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
right. one thing I was going to do soon is to rename all the session notes to something like DF: Session 1


[1/9/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
that way I can have great library or mawar sessions as well without causing problems


[1/9/2023 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
that would at least fix the backlink issues


[1/9/2023 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
but info leaking across campaigns is harder to generically fix


[1/9/2023 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
you could have a callout box for campaign events. would be kind of cool for someone like vistra (or lyra) who ends up interacting with PCs from multiple campaigns


[1/9/2023 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
it would still be random information lurking around but that doesn't really bother me too much. I don't think for example that you are going to use Agata as a major enemy in your campaign, since obviously she can't be killed by your players without causing a major divergence


[1/9/2023 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/9/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
So my basic thinking is:
* It is kinda cool to have a ready made set of pre-made characters who can be shared across campaigns, and that was one of the goals for the date convergence
* I really don't care if one of my PCs knows that Vistra ends up in Tokra in 50 years or whatever


[1/9/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
* Broken links are a bit annoying, but really only because of linting tools and similar that will find broken links


[1/9/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
* Incorrect backlinks are in fact something we should try to avoid


[1/9/2023 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, agree with all of this. incorrect backlinks should be pretty easy by just naming session notes with a campaign prefix, which I'm going to do anyway so I can track multiple campaigns in one vault


[1/9/2023 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
Finally.. there are a small number of cases where I think it might be important to have different versions of the same document.

My plan was to have a CleenseauCampaign specific version, i.e. 

ElaineII-CleenseauCampaign

And then have a script that replaces and restores the "real" version before publishing to the web


[1/9/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
this I'd only use for key plot stuff, like for example the fact that in 1722 Robert I is reveleated to be a lich


[1/9/2023 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that makes sense. basically anything where there is a historical event that is guaranteed to happen (so is history, from the point of view of Dunmar campaign) but hasn't happened yet in Cleenseau campaign.


[1/9/2023 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
this may become more relevant if, for example, you all ever go to Sembara in the Dunmar campaign


[1/9/2023 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/9/2023 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
It also might be worth thinking about spoiler tags for "medium" stuff


[1/9/2023 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
That is, each NPC has differing levels of importance in each campaign


[1/9/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
I think by far the most likely source of overlap is background in both, or minor in one and background in the other


[1/9/2023 1:09 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably worth putting "post my game" events under a spoiler tag for NPCs that originating as minor NPCs in my game that are being reused in yours.


[1/9/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
And if the games ever end up in more co-located geographies we can tweak process a bit.


[1/9/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
Do you know if there is a way to regenerate a template other than deleting and recreating?


[1/9/2023 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
where would you put something like "The Cleenseau Garrison of the Army of the West"?


[1/9/2023 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
My pcs met Ida, the captain, and at least for my own notes I want a article about her command structure


[1/9/2023 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
Gazeteer? or Organizations?


[1/9/2023 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
I would think Gazeteer... but what do you think?


[1/9/2023 1:50 PM] rsulfuratus
could be gazeteer or organizations...gets a bit tricky


[1/9/2023 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't have a good consistent set of rules for what goes in each. e.g., the Dunmari mystai cults could easily be in cosmology/religion


[1/9/2023 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
one solution might be to tag organizations specifically with an organization tag, and not have a specific organization directory. they go in gazetteer/<geographic location>, cosmology/religion, or people/groups, depending on whether they are associated with a particular country/place (Sembaran armies, Deno'qai tribes, Chardonian societies), religion (Dunmari mystery cults), or ambiguous (The Cleansed, The Rangers)


[1/9/2023 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I am also going to start tagging NPCs with DF (if introduced in Dunmari Frontier campaign), GL (Isaac's campaign), MC (Mawar), etc. You can add if things are introduced in your campaign. that gives an easy way to track game-relevant info as the vault grows


[1/9/2023 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
the solution for dynamic NPC information is probably dataview plus customjs plugin.

[1/9/2023 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
tricky bit would be getting it to work with the obsidian html export. it would mean the templater template would be a dataview block that would load information from fantasy calendar and the yaml frontmatter. but would need that to be exportable to html, which it might not be. or might require some hacky fiddling to get it to work.

[1/9/2023 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm that is pretty nice. could probably actually get pretty tricky using the fantasy calendar "today" feature to set up a bunch of javascript/dataview blocks to build pages appropriate for a given time. I'm not concerned if it takes an hour to export for the website so could get quite complicated


[1/9/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
My main concern would be if it got complicated to actually use obsidian in play to read the note 🙂


[1/9/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
well it would work fine in reader view always, since that is what you render with the plugins


[1/9/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess it would potentially just be tricky when editing the note at times


[1/9/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, you'd have gibberish javascript blocks instead of markdown in source view


[1/9/2023 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
location: "[[Cleenseau]]"
will correctly link the location


[1/9/2023 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
dataview and especially dataviewjs is ridiculously flexible, and in theory you can have a separate script with all the javascript. unless you have 'source view' checked it keeps rendered blocks in the edit view, so not even annoying to edit


[1/9/2023 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
my javascript is not good enough to (quickly) figure it out, but in theory it should be possible to move all the code in the template to an external script and replace it with a dataviewjs block that creates the entire summary info appropriate for the current day based on fantasy calendar


[1/9/2023 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
in principle it should even be possible to load a Chronology or Events section from another (non-exported) note or notes that auto-populates a chronology correct for the time.


[1/9/2023 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd still need to hide future events for Dunmar behind %%SECRET %% tags or have a future events note that is not shared, but otherwise might be pretty nice


[1/9/2023 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
just need to figure out the javascript to auto-build the NPC bio information and the chronology/events information. maybe also a location section


[1/9/2023 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway something to play around with


[1/9/2023 7:44 PM] rsulfuratus
ha. got it working (very preliminarily)


[1/9/2023 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
here is what I'm working on. DataviewTest has the code to render npc frontmatter with dataviewjs and customjs. npcUtils.js is the (current) class with functions that is loaded. one issue so far, is I'm not sure how to access the fantasy calendar api in either the customjs script or the dataviewjs block

(spelled correctly)


[1/9/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm that kinda works but it doesn't look like the information about what the current date is from fantasy calendar is passed correctly


[1/9/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
`window.FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0]` is undefined and so .current and .current.year don't return anything

[1/9/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
Might be the issue if you read into the details


[1/9/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
If the data view is trying to process before the calendar data has loaded


[1/9/2023 11:04 PM] .deciusmus
If you want to see the session notes for my game : https://msackton.github.io/taelgar1720/


[1/9/2023 11:09 PM] rsulfuratus
btw I figured out the calendar issue, somehow when I was copying things with iCloud I lost my calendar data, so there was nothing there anyway. restored from backup and it is working


[1/9/2023 11:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I almost have npcUtils working to autogenerate a NPC biosketch from yaml + javascript. if the died yaml is after current date, it acts like the person is alive


[1/9/2023 11:12 PM] rsulfuratus
are you generating your NPC list from dataview? or is that manual


[1/10/2023 7:35 AM] .deciusmus
My NPC list is manual at the moment


[1/10/2023 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
NPC tags a little tricky given shared npcs


[1/10/2023 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
should we do NPC/<campaign>/<importance>


[1/10/2023 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
I am using:
campaign/major, campaign/minor, campaign/background to indicate significance (mutually exclusive)
campaign/met, campaign/aware, campaign/unaware to indicate whether the party has met the person, knows of the person, or does not know of the person (mutually exclusive and hierarchical, so met implies aware and aware implies unmet)
historical to indicate the NPC is a historical figure. usually reserved for people who died a while ago. can be added to campaign tags.


[1/10/2023 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/10/2023 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
will push some updates momentarily so you can see how I'm doing it


[1/10/2023 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
but NPC/campaign/<whatever> can diverge


[1/10/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
so you'd have

tags: [NPC/DuFr/Major, NPC/DuFr/unaware]

or something else might have

[NPC/Historical]?


[1/10/2023 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm tagging all NPCs with NPC/DuFr/<something>


[1/10/2023 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
ah, ok


[1/10/2023 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
so for example some random sembaran royalty would be NPC/DuFr/unaware, NPC/historical


[1/10/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
and Apollyon would be NPC/DuFr/major, NPC/DuFr/aware, NPC/historical


[1/10/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
something like that


[1/10/2023 11:56 AM] .deciusmus
right, I see


[1/10/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
the ultimate goal is to remove the auto-export of people and build a nice NPC index with dataview for each campaign separately


[1/10/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
although you can click through to some random NPC pages in your export because of the way linking works. e.g. you can find Delwath if you click through enough backlinks


[1/10/2023 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
Is that because of links via the Gazeeteer, or because of tags?


[1/10/2023 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
because of Gazetteer links


[1/10/2023 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
its hard to avoid that at some level


[1/10/2023 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. elf -> forest of dreams -> ko'zula -> forest of nightmares -> delwath


[1/10/2023 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
but  I actually kind of like it. all important secrets are hidden with %% so if any player is curious enough to just click around and find things to ask about that is 100% fine with me


[1/10/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
I just need to make sure the sembaran history is sanitized


[1/10/2023 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right, it is a bit trickier for your gam.e


[1/10/2023 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
the javascript replacement for the npc header helps a fair bit


[1/10/2023 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
I'm perfectly happy for someone who bothers to read to know more about Chardon and Dunmar than someone else


[1/10/2023 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
in fact it would probably be possible to set it up so that if dateBorn > currentYear, the entire content of the note is wrapped in %%


[1/10/2023 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
that would be clever


[1/10/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
history notes are trickier


[1/10/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
probably need to be manually sanitized


[1/10/2023 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
you are using dataview and what other plugin?


[1/10/2023 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
customjs


[1/10/2023 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that is what lets you load arbitrary javascript into a dataviewjs codeblock


[1/10/2023 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
Evaluation Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getPronouns')
    at eval (eval at <anonymous> (plugin:dataview), <anonymous>:4:25)

[1/10/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
huh it was working last night


[1/10/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I added a bunch of comments to the end of the file, seems to work if you remove the comments for some reason


[1/10/2023 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
i just moved them to the front


[1/10/2023 1:27 PM] .deciusmus
fyi CTL-SHIFT-I (at least on windows) opens the javascript debug console which is very useful

👍

[1/10/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a prototype of an NPC template that autogenerates an NPC page from separate subnotes. allows an easy way to report information about that NPC at a specific time. 

the major downside is that as best as I can tell, it requires that the main NPC page simply be an autogenerated template, and you keep the actual meaningful text in a separate file (or potentially multiple files for different sections). 

this could be enough of an annoyance that it isn't worthwhile, primarily because of the way it messes with links. you would presumably want links to hit the autogenerated template, but that means that you can't look at links while you edit.


[1/10/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, you could set up the NPCNAME.text page with a dataview frontend code block that would include backlinks from the template, yaml from the template, and a few other things.


[1/10/2023 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
does it work with html export?


[1/10/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
it would work with the obs.html package you found


[1/10/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
but I haven't tested it


[1/10/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
did you actually push? I don't see a change


[1/10/2023 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
oops got caught in a meeting


[1/10/2023 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed now


[1/10/2023 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
although was just messing around so the current version doesn't actually quite work


[1/10/2023 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to get it to insert section links instead of full files


[1/10/2023 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure I follow the downside with links


[1/10/2023 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
you just link to [[Tester] what is the issue?


[1/10/2023 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
ah. right, that's fine. but when I am translating my NPC notes from the scattered OneNote format to a consistent note in Obsidian, I often rely on the backlines to an NPC, like in which Session Notes is this NPC mentioned?


[1/10/2023 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
can't see that with this system, since you only edit the text in tester.text which has no incoming links


[1/10/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, I see


[1/10/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
But realistically it would crazy to go to this much trouble for every NPC


[1/10/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
And also you are ahead, so for you it would never really matter


[1/10/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
Unless we end up in Sembara or something and you are expanding on my Sembara stuff


[1/10/2023 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
I only have like 12-13 NPCs / groups of NPCs that I care about tracking their movement and chronology, so yes it is not that many


[1/10/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
But even then, why bother with this?


[1/10/2023 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
it annoys my sense of organization to have some NPC pages autogenerated from a template and some NPC pages freeform? no real reason


[1/10/2023 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
Ah


[1/10/2023 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
well


[1/10/2023 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
tell your sense of organization you have better things to do 🙂


[1/10/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
For me... this would be extremely useful for a couple of key pages, like say Robert I.

I could write a section about the lich thing and only import it if current date > 1722


[1/10/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
and so on


[1/10/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
And also gives us both a convinent way to manage "shared NPCs" (i.e. NPCs that are actually showing up in both games)


[1/10/2023 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
you don't even need dataview blocks for this,


[1/10/2023 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd have to test with html but if you do:
```
%%
![[link.to.secret.info]]
%%
```


[1/10/2023 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
you'll get the text of the note displayed in a comment block which will (I presume) be stripped out by the html generator


[1/10/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
Right but what problem does that solve?


[1/10/2023 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I guess the benefit of the import conditional on date is that info from the past could show up as history in my taelgarverse website but not show up in your 1720 website


[1/10/2023 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/10/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
Or let's say it made sense to have Dain Goldhammer show up in my game


[1/10/2023 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
I could remove the "part of a group that explored eudome's tower"


[1/10/2023 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
that is not very realistic at some level as why bother?


[1/10/2023 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
but it would be possible to kick that out to a chronology section that only gets imported in your version


[1/10/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right, how much effort is it really worth to have the player-facing version of NPCs they will probably never meet be totally consistent with the current history of the world?


[1/10/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
where I was actually more interested in this is for cross-campaign NPCs between Great Library / Mawar / Dunmari Frontier. mostly Great Library vs Dunmari Frontier as there is little point in keeping Mawar stuff "secret"


[1/10/2023 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I was starting to dump a bunch of Great Library NPCs but it adds a lot of clutter and I wanted a way to only import "Dunmari Frontier" information


[1/10/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
Ah


[1/10/2023 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
part of the problem is that dataverse doesn't have a good way to query sections within a file


[1/10/2023 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
What I am interested in this for is because it offends my sense of completeness to have the Sembaran history just end in 1719


[1/10/2023 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that too


[1/10/2023 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
So for me, I'd like to have the flexibility to be able to
(a) contribute to/make up stuff up to the 'present day' via the git repo
(b) still exclude the stuff I make up "post my game" from the data my players see


[1/10/2023 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
a good general script to pull information X from note Y and insert into note Z conditional on (game year, campaign, etc) would be great for many things


[1/10/2023 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/10/2023 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
so that is what I was trying to figure out, but then if that works, it appeals to me to autotemplate every NPC in a way that naturally can grow for the ~15 really important NPCs and stay simple for the ~100 background NPCs


[1/10/2023 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
do you know what the javascript for inserting a note is?


[1/10/2023 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I've been using  ```await dv.io.load("File") => "# File\nThis is an example file..."```


[1/10/2023 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/


[1/10/2023 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
returns the contents of "File" as a string


[1/10/2023 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so this reads the contents of Tester.text and prints it:
```
let Overview = await dv.io.load("_templates/testing/Tester.text.md")
dv.paragraph(Overview)
```


[1/10/2023 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
what I haven't figured out how to do are:
1) get a path from a dataview Link objects
2) extract only part of a target note, e.g. just one section


[1/10/2023 4:49 PM] rsulfuratus
neither is totally critical but makes building an NPC template way easier, since you can have extraneous stuff on the NPCNAME.text page that isn't loaded into the template


[1/10/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
```for (let group of dv.pages("#sembara-person-events")) {
   if (group.eventDate > 1719) {
        var link = group.file.link
        link.embed = true
        dv.span(link)
   }
}
```

[1/10/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
with frontmatter like:
---
eventDate: 1700
tags: [sembara-person-events ]
---


[1/10/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
nice. so basically you have to stick with the concept of one event = one note, but in that framework you can do a lot


[1/10/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
is there a reason you have to use tags? couldn't you just have a _events directory and scan that for file.name matches Sembara Person?


[1/10/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I use the tag browser a fair bit so avoiding a huge amount of tag proliferation would be nice (but not critical)


[1/10/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
laziness to prove the concept


[1/10/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
but also, it can be sections


[1/10/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. it doesn't have to be one-event = one file


[1/10/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. you could have

eventEndDate = 1721


[1/10/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
and that could describe everything from birth -> 1721


[1/10/2023 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
ah right, it just needs to be one file per chunk of text you retreive


[1/10/2023 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/10/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
even better


[1/10/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
```
let currentFolder = "\"" + dv.current().file.folder + "\""
for (let group of dv.pages(currentFolder).sort(f => f.eventEndDate)) {
   if (group.name == dv.current().name)
   if (group.eventEndDate > 1719) {
        var link = group.file.link
        link.embed = true
        link.display = "natural"
        dv.span(link)
   }
}
```


[1/10/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
gets every file in the same folder as the current where the frontmatter name matches the NPC name


[1/10/2023 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
cool


[1/10/2023 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
here's the final.. gotta go make dinner but can push if you want:

```
let currentYear = window.FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0].current.year
let currentFolder = "\"" + dv.current().file.folder + "\""
for (let group of dv.pages(currentFolder).sort(f => f.eventEndDate)) {
   if (group.name == dv.current().name && group.type == "NPC_Event")  {  
      if (group.eventEndDate <= currentYear) {
         var link = group.file.link
        link.embed = true
        link.display = "natural"
        dv.span(link)
      }
   }
}
```


[1/10/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
requires frontmatter of:

eventEndDate: <year>
name: matching person
type: NPC_Event


[1/10/2023 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
that's great


[1/10/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
it looks a bit weird without custom CSS to tweak the rendering of the embed block


[1/10/2023 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
feel free to push but I am not using it yet, focusing on just the templater frontmatter and getting NPC info into obsidian


[1/10/2023 6:04 PM] .deciusmus

[1/10/2023 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
you should be able to get the path from a dv link and then use dv.io.load to get the text, and use dv.paragraph to format how you like


[1/10/2023 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
although presumably the same obs.html plugin that renders dataviewjs for html export can use the custom css as well


[1/10/2023 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
The problem with dv.io.load is that it has the yaml frontmatter


[1/10/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
ah right


[1/10/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right that is why I was trying to get text of just a section


[1/10/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
but your way looks like it will work


[1/10/2023 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I am trying to get all my NPC notes into Obsidian and want to remove the NPC/unsorted tag from everyone I've looked at. for your sembara NPCs I am using NPC/DuFr/unaware, and also NPC/<campaignTag>/unsorted, do you care what campaign tag we use for the Cleenseau campaign?


[1/10/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
I was using Cleenseau but if you want something shorter anything is fine


[1/10/2023 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, I'll probably use Clee which is pretty obvious and easy to type

{Reactions}
👍

[1/10/2023 7:15 PM] rsulfuratus
using this for the Charmhearts page, since they probably pass through Cleenseau frequently


[1/10/2023 7:15 PM] rsulfuratus
pretty nice

I have this in my Ausson's Crossing document:

The Halfling Caravan
A caravan of halflings from Chardon, bound for Embry in Sembara has been staying here for the last few days. Mostly keeping to themselves, the caravan has four wagons, a dozen horses, and the following halflings:

Bree Charmheart (she/her), the trademaster and spokesperson
Cora Charmheart (she/her), an elderly woman, often seen in the Inn common room
Anders Charmheart (he/him), the quartermaster and cook

There are a dozen other halflings including several children, who have mostly kept to the wagons. They are carrying clockwork, stained glass, fireworks, intricate toys, and fine cloth from Chardon, and have some elaborate systems in the wagons to protect the goods in transit.


[1/10/2023 7:19 PM] .deciusmus
Haven't gotten to adding that to obisidian yet since that game is over


[1/10/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus

[1/10/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't remember when your Ausson's Crossing game was set


[1/10/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
Originally 1650s but I've moved it to 1688


[1/10/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
There are actually a couple of crossovers my players want to do with aged versions of their characters from that game


[1/11/2023 7:27 AM] .deciusmus
I have a lot of work to do today so probably can't mess around with obsidian much, but I think we are approaching templates the wrong way.

DataviewJS is very hard to get exported -- I couldn't get the obs.html plugin to work, for example, and I think there are a lot of limits on html export with so much dynamic data -- for example the commercial obsidian publish doesn't really work well either with dataviewJS.

For me at least, a key goal is to produce a website so the export challenges are somewhat blocking. 

I *think* the right way to do this is to work with templater, which can replace active templates in the file on startup (and could, I think, replace all active templates in all NPC files on startup).

So imagine something like this:
* Add some blocking to find the basic info block and chronology block of an NPC file
* Templater startup template that finds all NPC files, inserts the NPC header template in place of the basic info block and the chronology template in place of the chronology block


[1/11/2023 7:28 AM] .deciusmus
(and then process the template in the file)


[1/11/2023 7:28 AM] .deciusmus
It would mean that date-changes require a restart of the app but I think that is ok.


[1/11/2023 7:28 AM] .deciusmus
I guess it would make git a mess as we'd be constantly reverting each others NPC header blocks..


[1/11/2023 7:28 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm...


[1/11/2023 8:43 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah. right now I am focusing on session prep for Monday and just getting my notes organized into obsidian - while the javascript is fun it is more useful to me just to have everything in there (so I'm just using the templater npc header we have already).

I think ultimately the best solution is a templater-based solution that creates NPC pages in a directory that is not shared on github. if we could automate the creation of pages from various pieces, and figure out a way to correctly handle links, that would probably work well. you'd just build the npc pages as part of the website build process. 

links are the trickest thing because you'd want links pointing to the internal npc page for regular use and the autobuilt npc page for the website. there may not be a way around that.


[1/11/2023 8:44 AM] rsulfuratus
constantly reverting each others NPC header blocks is a bit annoying since it will often create merge conflicts which take time to sort out. I don't want to have to correct 20 merge conflicts each time I sync with the repo


[1/11/2023 8:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but we are both pretty good with computers so this shouldn't be an insolvable problem. 

ultimately I also want to figure out a way to generate different websites for different campaigns (or, at least, have a way to filter the website build based on campaign tags) so it is worth the effort for me


[1/11/2023 8:57 AM] rsulfuratus
and also I am increasingly wanting to use the full power of obsidian. like, for my reference I want a table of NPCs with links to session notes that each appear in, and an NPC relationship graph that shows each NPC and the links to places/people that appear in their note, that sort of thing. just to help with tracking where everyone is (the mirror plus Delwath scrying all the time make me want to track lots of stuff, minimally so when I make something up spur of the moment I don't later forget it)


[1/11/2023 8:57 AM] rsulfuratus
so moving towards a system where we preprocess the vault somehow (with templater, or something like that) to produce the website is increasingly appealing


[1/11/2023 8:58 AM] .deciusmus
I mean ultimately maybe I'll finally learn Javascript


[1/11/2023 8:58 AM] .deciusmus
Conceptually, obsidiantohtml is the wrong way to do this


[1/11/2023 8:58 AM] .deciusmus
You want a plugin within obisidian that exports the reading views


[1/11/2023 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that is ideal

Are your various "Races of Taelgar" documents canonical enough to port (in GM binder)


[1/11/2023 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus
mostly I think so. the mechanics no, but the lore yes


[1/11/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
I find myself looking there for background on say, lifespan


[1/11/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
and having it in obsidian would be easier


[1/11/2023 11:27 AM] rsulfuratus
dwarves (in the races v2) is very up-to-date, I updated for the riswynn solo


[1/11/2023 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
elves are sort of up to date, but you could also incorporate some of the stuff from the elves doc in gdrive from working out the ka, etc


[1/11/2023 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
stoneborn and lizardfolk I haven't done anything with for a while so those are up to date


[1/11/2023 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
halflings are sort of up to date in gmbinder, there is also a doc of notes, mostly stuff from wellby via schwartz, that I shared with you in gdrive. this could all be dumped in a comment into a halfling obsidian doc


[1/11/2023 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
humans are basically a stub and could be updated with the various strands of emmigration from hkar from gdrive


[1/11/2023 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
For halflings I copied everything from the doc to either the halflings doc or the first one doc, and left most in comments


[1/11/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
great


[1/11/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I was thinking a lot about the website setup while walking to pick up my lunch and have some ideas for a solution


[1/11/2023 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the goals are as follows:
1) have a shared obsidian vault that allows us to collaborate on worldbuilding, keep notes organized, and share NPCs across campaigns
2) export a website that exposes relevant information for players tailored to a specific campaign


[1/11/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
the problem is that if we go deep into the note template / export direct from obsidian way to build a website is that while it works for 2, it makes 1 harder.


[1/11/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
links get messy, and there is no reason why your obsidian vault needs to display information correct for 1719, as long as the website does


[1/11/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/11/2023 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I was looking at the obsdiantohtml code, and it already reads through every markdown file to convert obsidian-flavored markdown to standard markdown for export


[1/11/2023 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
it is all python, so I don't think it would be too hard for me to tweak this to add text based filtering


[1/11/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
[ although I do find having the age correct nice ]


[1/11/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that is super helpful because if Delwath and co are in sembara in 1749 I really want to be able to see that NPC x you made up would be 112 and should be dead


[1/11/2023 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
what I would do is the following:
1) have a structured tagging system for information that occurs at a specific time, that means that if current date < tagged date, that paragraph should be stripped from the output. this should ideally be invisible in the reader view in obsidian, but can be processed by the python code that converts obsidian markdown


[1/11/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
2) use dynamic npc bioblocks for our own internal purposes, and replace the codeblocks with year-relevant text via python for the web export (this should be fairly simple as long as NPCs always start yaml block - title - bioblock)


[1/11/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
How hard is 2?


[1/11/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
Is the idea to try to run the templater code somehow?


[1/11/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
Or would it make more sense to have the templater block only be dynamic for age + current location?


[1/11/2023 12:29 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, realistically, the only thing I really care about is age


[1/11/2023 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
if it is just for internal use we could just use the dataviewjs codeblock


[1/11/2023 12:30 PM] .deciusmus
and just not publish the bioblock to web?


[1/11/2023 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
the python code swaps out the dataviewjs codeblock and replaces it with plain markdown built in the same yaml frontmatter


[1/11/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd have to figure out a way to add an option to a fork of obsidiantohtml to set the date for the website


[1/11/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but if I'm already tweaking it to custom process markdown files that shouldn't be that difficult


[1/11/2023 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus
basically I'd write a new version of this: https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html/blob/master/obsidianhtml/parser/MarkdownPage.py

[1/11/2023 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus
it already grabs yaml frontmatter and codeblocks


[1/11/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
could either modify that or write my own python script that sits between the md generation stage and the html generation stage of obsidiantohtml


[1/11/2023 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
so the basic structure would be:
1) obsidian vault contains all the information for all dates, and also includes dataviewjs codeblocks to dynamically generate things like NCP bioblocks, possibly NPC current location (this is a bit trickier because you'd then need a way to record where NPC is when - might be easier to just do this manually), possibly things like tavern information (founded X, destroyed Y), whatever else seems useful and fun for internal session planning / worldbuilding purposes. this is all done view dataviewjs and/or templater code in obsidian. 
2) we have some kind of tag that is easy to parse in python that marks paragraphs that happen at a specific date, and potentially that are relevant/known only to a specific campaign. 
3) to generate the website, we run obsidiantohtml, either in modified form or in combination with custom code. this modifies markdown pages to: a) replace dataviewjs codeblocks with static markdown, and b) remove paragraphs tagged with a date or a campaign that should not be included. once we have the modified markdown, we can run obsidiantohtml again to produce html from markdown.


[1/11/2023 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense


[1/11/2023 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think 3a -- replacing dataviewjs codeblocks with static markdown -- isn't really going to work generally


[1/11/2023 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
but for npcbioblocks and other special things would presumably be easy


[1/11/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
right, the assumption is that most dataview blocks aren't meant to be exported and will just be removed


[1/11/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
the only thing that gets replaced is structured stuff.


[1/11/2023 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
this works just fine, btw:

```dataviewjs NPCBioBlock
```


[1/11/2023 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
so it would be pretty easy to tag code blocks with "known purposes" and then just re-gen in python


[1/11/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
right that is what I was thinking


[1/11/2023 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
it would work well for dynamically generated text from yaml frontmatter. wouldn't work so well for some other things, like producing an npc list using dataview queries


[1/11/2023 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but the latter could be done with a templater command that already produces static markdown, and would be in the campaign directory so wouldn't hit git issues


[1/11/2023 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
%% AFTER 1721 %%
## stuff
sdj
lkds
%% AFTER 1721 END %%


[1/11/2023 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
seems fairly natural


[1/11/2023 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
the only problem with that is that I am not sure where in the obsidantohtml code comments are stripped


[1/11/2023 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
<date:(DATE)> text </date:(DATE)> might be easier, kind of pseudo-html


[1/11/2023 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
ideally want something that is a) invisible in obsidian reader view, and b) is passed unmodified by obsidianhtml when it converts obsidian markdown to proper markdown


[1/11/2023 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
might just need to play around a bit and see what works


[1/11/2023 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
for now I would not switch to this system. but I will probably play around a bit over the long weekend with writing some python that takes as input a date and a markdown page and writes out a corrected markdown page, updating npc bio block and removing text as needed


[1/11/2023 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
if that is easy can then get more complicated


[1/11/2023 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
honestly, the more useful thing would be to get an NPCBioBlock working


[1/11/2023 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
than removing text


[1/11/2023 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
right maybe I'll do that first


[1/11/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
hell, if we are willing to do HTML there is an even easier way to do it


[1/11/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
<div class="mindate1719">
sdj
lkds
</div>


[1/11/2023 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
as long as that is preserved intact, you can just have a  CSS style to set display:none


[1/11/2023 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
that isn't super flexible, but I bet there is a way to use html5 data attributes and CSS to make the date stuff work with no processing work at all


[1/11/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
just a requirement to wrap the information in the right <div> blocks when righting

don't quite understand what that is supposed to do


[1/11/2023 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
page data:

```
<%+ tp.frontmatter.born %>

This data applies to both Clee and DuFr
And we continue the paragraph with markdown like a [[Halflings|halfling]] link
{ .campaign-event data-applies-to-campaign='clee dufr' }

This data applies to only DuFr
This data continues and is about stuff that doesn't apply to Clee
{  .campaign-event data-applies-to-campaign='dufr' }
```


[1/11/2023 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
CSS (for the website only)
```
.campaign-event {
   display: none;
}

.campaign-event[data-applies-to-campaign~="clee"] {
  display: inherit !important;
}

[1/11/2023 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
But the basic idea is to apply CSS classes to blocks, and then use CSS selectors to hide stuff on the web


[1/11/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
It is a little hacky for dates because CSS selectors can only do exact matches


[1/11/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
well, I have a python script that strips out codeblocks, replaces codeblocks at that are labeled (in the first line) NPCBioBlock with a custom NPCBioBlock generated from yaml metadata, and strips any text in a block that starts %%^Date:year%% and ends %%^End%%, and then overwrites the markdown file


[1/11/2023 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so you would run obsidan to html to produce markdown, then my code to clean markdown, then obsidian to html to produce clean html


[1/11/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
You moved to fast 🙂


[1/11/2023 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
still fiddling to make the parsing more flexble. could have the cleaned blocks start %%^Strip%% and then have properties (e.g. date=, campaign=)


[1/11/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually think cleaning the markdown is more flexible than css classes


[1/11/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
So... on the bio block, I think having a bio block is actually the wrong way to go


[1/11/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
It was occuring to me that there are all kinds of things we might want to have different in a header block


[1/11/2023 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
<%+ tp.(something) %>

is a lot nicer than the messy dataviewJS stuff


[1/11/2023 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
(the magic + means re-render each time you display the page)


[1/11/2023 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
And templator supports a Javascript format


[1/11/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I haven't gotten the <%+ > to work with computed variables


[1/11/2023 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe I'm doing something simple wrong


[1/11/2023 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/11/2023 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
let me prove this first


[1/11/2023 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
have a meeting now


[1/11/2023 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
let me know if it works


[1/11/2023 2:08 PM] .deciusmus
<%+ tp.user.getAge(tp.frontmatter.born, tp.frontmatter.died) %>


[1/11/2023 2:08 PM] .deciusmus
it works


[1/11/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
Ok, it works perfectly.

Here's the way to do it:

1. Add this JS to a file in _templates\templateScripts\getAge.js

```
function getAgeString(yearBorn,yearDied,noteYear) {
            
    if (!yearBorn && !yearDied) return "(unknown age)";
    if (yearBorn && yearDied && yearBorn > yearDied) return "(timetraveler, check your YAML)";
    
    let currentYear =  window.FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0].current.year

    if (noteYear) {
        currentYear = noteYear
    }
    
    // we have a born year, no died year
    if (yearBorn && !yearDied) {
        if (yearBorn > currentYear) return "(not yet born)";
        else return (currentYear - yearBorn) + " years old";
    }

    // we have a death year, no born year
    if (yearDied && !yearBorn) {
        if (yearDied < currentYear) return "(deceased)";
        return "(unknown age)";
    }

    // we have both    
    if (yearDied < currentYear) {
        if (yearBorn > currentYear) return "(not yet born)";
        return "(deceased) at age " + (currentYear-yearBorn);
    }

    return (currentYear-yearBorn) + " years old";
}
module.exports = getAgeString;
```

2. In the templator config, set a user scripts folder (to _templates\templateScripts and click the little refresh icon. You should use "detected 1 user script, tp.user.getAge)

3. Add <%+ tp.user.getAge(tp.frontmatter.born, tp.frontmatter.died, tp.frontmatter.yearOverride) %> to a page

[1/11/2023 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
4. Click "reading mode"


[1/11/2023 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
It caches the result, so if you change the YAML you have to close the tab and reopen it


[1/11/2023 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
does that work with obsidiantohtml? that is what does the exported markdown look like?


[1/11/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
I assume it would have the <%+ xxx %> in it


[1/11/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
but... I was basically thinking rather than an NPCBioBlock python script we could have a python script that basically replaces the simple line::

<%+ tp.user.getAge() %>

With a python-copy of the JS


[1/11/2023 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
Then the python duplicates less of the obsidian


[1/11/2023 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
so rather than regenerating the entire bio block you just replace the age piece


[1/11/2023 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
<%+ tp.user.getValue(tp, "origin") %>

<%+ tp.user.getAge(tp) %>

<%+ tp.user.getDeath(tp) %>


[1/11/2023 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
origin: OldTown
origin-clee: OldTownDD


[1/11/2023 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
because my JS for getValue has "clee" hardcoded the preview renders as OldTownDD


[1/11/2023 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
obsidian html generated MD is:
<%+ tp.user.getValue(tp, "origin") %>   
   
<%+ tp.user.getAge(tp) %>   
   
<%+ tp.user.getDeath(tp) %>


[1/11/2023 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
So... I think this would all work totally brilliantly


[1/11/2023 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
We just need a python function that runs on the generated markdown and:

1. Finds all instances of the string <%+ tp.user.getAge(tp) %> and replaces it with the correct age string
2. Finds all instances of the string <%+ tp.user.getDeath(tp) %> and replaces with the the correct death string
3. Finds all instances of the string <%+ tp.user.getBirth(tp) %> and replaces with the the correct birth string
4. Finds all instances of the string <%+ tp.user.getValue(tp, "(something)") %> and replaces it with the correct string based on the frontmatter and the input campaign


[1/11/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
that is pretty straightforward


[1/11/2023 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
And I'm playing around with generalizing to a "status" that would work for other types of dates


[1/11/2023 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I don't really like location. want you want is "status: key, value" where key is a date and status is what is written for that date


[1/11/2023 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. I want Arcus to be "petrified" for any date after march something 1748


[1/11/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
what you really want is something like

getPageStatus(tp, "status to use if not yet existing", "status to use destroyed")

and

getPageStart(tp, "prefix")

and

getPageEnd(tp, "prefix")

---

Then you can have Arcus have:

getPageStatus(tp, "not yet born", "petrified")


[1/11/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
Or an inn that burned down in 1722:

getPageStatus(tp, "not yet built", "burned down")


[1/11/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
Or a regular person:

getPageStatus(tp, "not yet born", "deceased")


[1/11/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
But that isn't quite the same as born/died


[1/11/2023 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right but that can't report location. location is actually the thing that comes up the most - like, who is roaming around northern dunmar in Nov 1748 is a pretty relevant question for my session prep for monday


[1/11/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
But is there any upside in tracking by date for that?


[1/11/2023 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
why not just do it by campaign


[1/11/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
because location changes by time within a campaign. one of the most common things I check my notes for is who is where


[1/11/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
for about 80% of npcs that doesn't change


[1/11/2023 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
But do you care about their location history?


[1/11/2023 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
At some level, the location is going to change only when you edit the frontmatter to give them a new location


[1/11/2023 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
I care about location now, and "last known location" from the player perspective


[1/11/2023 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess just a "location now" and a "last known location" would be enough


[1/11/2023 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but isn't that just:

last-seen-location:
location-now:


[1/11/2023 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/11/2023 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
and then use a campaign flag if needed


[1/11/2023 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
so it would work to have:

last-seen-location-dufr:


[1/11/2023 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
(not sure how that works with dataqueries and such)


[1/11/2023 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
can we agree on camelCase for metadata instead of words-by-dashes?


[1/11/2023 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/11/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
The idea of the getValue(tp, string) JS function is that it gets the value out of the frontmatter that you pass as the string


[1/11/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
But it does 2 things -- 
1. Gets it live
2. Allows for (value)_(campaign) to override (value)


[1/11/2023 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
Realistically the main use case of this would be something like:

I want a halfling caravan to come to Cleenseau and rather than make up a whole new one, I grab the Charmhearts.

But I don't want the location to be "Tokra" so I add

currentLocation_Clee: Cleenseau


[1/11/2023 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
then getValue resolves Cleenseau for me and whatever is in currentLocation for you


[1/11/2023 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
On the other hand, if you steal some of my NPCs, because we are in western Sembara, you can add currentLocation_DuFr


[1/11/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so I need to write a python function for each .js function, basically


[1/11/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
and then just run my processing script (which takes date and campaign flags) on the obsidiantohtml markdown


[1/11/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I am also going to keep the code that removes %%^%% text %%^End%% blocks, where you can either have a ^Date: or ^Campaign flag


[1/11/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
No


[1/11/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
I have something much better


[1/11/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
hold on


[1/11/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
this is freaking making me learn JS the languag I hate the most


[1/11/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
Does this seem too annoying:

whereabouts: [{date: 1740-10-11, place: Thing}, {date: 1710-10-11, place: other}]


[1/11/2023 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
Ok


[1/11/2023 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
that was an unfortunate detour from my actual work... But


[1/11/2023 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think it would be pretty straightforward to make the following work:

Define a whereabouts yaml frontmatter like:
```whereabouts: 
- {date: 1740-10-11, place: on 1740, region: xx}
- {date: 1720-12-12, place: "on 1720 dec"}
- {date: 1710-10-11, place: on 1710}
- {date: 1719-10-23, place: on oct 23}
- {date: 1719-10-18, place: on oct 18}
```
Define a yaml frontmatter of lastSeenByParty: xxx (that could have a campaign specific override)

Define a dataview table that shows you both (a) everyone in a certain region as of a date and also (b) where the party thinks the person is

Define a templater JS function that tells you for a specific NPC (a) where the person is and (b) where the party thinks the person is


[1/11/2023 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
If you pythonized the JS functions you could then have the HTML export versions have the actual location stripped and the party location be the location


[1/11/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
for NPCs that you didn't care for all this detail, you could just do:

whereabouts:
- {date: 1-1-1, place: x}


[1/11/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Or, alternatively, the NPC template could be something like:

Origin: (if specified)
Home: (...)
Whereabouts: (only if the whereabouts is defined)


[1/11/2023 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
That seems pretty cool. Need to think about how many NPCs it would actually affect and whether it is worth the extra effort over just tracking a single location/last seen location


[1/11/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Ah


[1/11/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
but the reason it would potentially be worthwhile is to make it easier to track for shared NPCs


[1/11/2023 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
Hmm yeah that’s true


[1/11/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
because the data is normalized, it doesn't impact either of us


[1/11/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
and the dataquery stuff is a bit easier


[1/11/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
the problem I was thinking was...


[1/11/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Let's say we did just:

currentLocation: (somewhere in DuFr)
currentLocation_clee: (somewhere in Clee)

Then if you have a query that gets everyone in a certain location via a dataview table, it is going to show weird NPCs you don't care about


[1/11/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
(if we ever have same locations)


[1/11/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
Now, maybe, who cares


[1/11/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
or we could just have he current location always be campaign specific


[1/11/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
But actually, I think it would be possible to take into account born and died as well


[1/11/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
So that you could get a location of everyone who is currently alive in a current region, regardless of who defined the NPC


[1/11/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
You'd potentially want the dataview query to include "home" if the character didn't have a whereabouts


[1/11/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
For example:

```dataviewjs 
let pages = dv.pages("#NPC/testing")
let currentYear = window.FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0].current.year
let currentMonth = window.FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0].current.month
let currentDay = window.FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0].current.day

for (let group of pages) {     

    if (group.whereabouts) {
         let whereaboutsAtDate = group.whereabouts.sort((a,b)=>a.date-b.date).find(f => f.date <= new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, currentDay) )
         if (whereaboutsAtDate != undefined && whereaboutsAtDate.region == "Dunmar") {
           dv.paragraph(group.name)
           dv.paragraph("b." + group.born)
           dv.paragraph(whereaboutsAtDate)
           dv.paragraph("Party Last Met: " + group.lastSeenByParty.toString())
         }
    } else if (group.home == "Dunmar") { dv.paragraph(group.name)}
}
```


[1/11/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
that gives you a list of all of the NPCs that are currently in Dunmar


[1/11/2023 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
that is pretty cool


[1/11/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a meeting at 5 but will have a few hours after dinner to mess around. my understanding of where we are is:

1) for dynamic templates, we will use Templater dynamic templates + user code, with a python script to replace <%+ > constructs in obsdiantohtml md output with the correct value from replicating the Templater user functions in Python. Initially this will be mostly for NPC headers but can extend to anything, just need to have an equivalent python function for anything to replace. 

1a) for NPC locations, can use a complex whereabouts yaml frontmatter as needed, as discussed above 

2) for campaign specific or date specific freeform text, will either use python text stripping based on %%^Date%% or %%^Campaign%% comments, or will use custom css and the obsidian-markdown-attributes


[1/11/2023 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
honestly the most immediately useful thing to me is to get the dynamic templates (not necessarily with the whereabouts code) working, so if you can push your js files I can fiddle tonight with reimplementing in my python filter, and then at least we can update the NPC blocks to be dynamic immediately, and have that work with website exports


[1/11/2023 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
if the whereabouts stuff is already working in your test code may as well include it even if I don't immediately use it (there is a bit of an issue here in that I don't necessarily want to encode crucial secret whereabouts in metadata since I can't use the %%SECRET %% comment for my github filter there, although I could write another github filter that would clean up just the whereabouts location specifically I guess


[1/11/2023 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I didn't think about the whereabouts for secrets (but you'd have the same problem for any location-based NPC with metadata)


[1/11/2023 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
I will push something soon, just trying to clean it up a bit


[1/11/2023 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I think using whereabouts is actually pretty useful for this because it is really easy to write a github filter that just replaces the place:  with place: unknown[1] etc for any place tagged with ^secret or something like that


[1/11/2023 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
just would need to think a bit about how to encode it so that it still works with dataview


[1/11/2023 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
do:

- { date: x, place: y, region: z, secret: 1 }


[1/11/2023 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
then replace the place/region with unknown


[1/11/2023 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
that should work


[1/11/2023 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
right that


[1/11/2023 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be easy


[1/11/2023 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
the one annoying thing btw is that the dates have to be full dates, i.e. y-m-d


[1/11/2023 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
but it is easy enough to use y-01-01 when you dont care


[1/11/2023 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
if any date isn't a full date, it all breaks down


[1/11/2023 4:49 PM] rsulfuratus
sure that's fine


[1/11/2023 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
probably 80% of NPCs don't need whereabouts, 10% just need one or two YYYY-01-01 to reflect cross-campaign shifts in location (e.g. vistra), and only 10% need anything more complicated


[1/11/2023 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/11/2023 4:51 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, at some level, the other thing you could do would be just gitignore Vola, Kadmos, Cassion, and a few others


[1/11/2023 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think it is that hard to replace whereabouts with a secret if it is well-structured


[1/11/2023 4:52 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/11/2023 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but yeah if I can't get the secrets filter working that is easy. it is only like 10 or so NPCs and all are ones you wouldn't really use in your campaign anyway


[1/11/2023 4:52 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, that is better but realistically neither my game nor my general design to do collaborative worldbuilding will be impacted in the slightest if you drop a handful of "key" npcs from the shared set


[1/11/2023 4:56 PM] rsulfuratus
last question, did you get the css class thing working or should I still include the text filter for history stuff in my python?


[1/11/2023 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
I did get it working but it is a bit messy


[1/11/2023 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
OK


[1/11/2023 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed my JS files


[1/11/2023 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
See the specifications.md for details


[1/11/2023 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
If you have a mechanism that uses date comparisons to strip I think that is better than the CSS


[1/11/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
the css stuff requires something like

{ .timeline-event data-date-applies="1719 1720 1721 1748 1749"}


[1/11/2023 6:17 PM] .deciusmus
and if the current year is not one of 1719, 1720, 1721, 1748, or 1749 it won't appear


[1/11/2023 6:17 PM] .deciusmus
which is a bit of a mess


[1/11/2023 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, well you can also just use my %%^Date:%% thing which will take YYYY-MM-DD format or YYYY format


[1/11/2023 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
that is already written. I can make an option to turn it off but it shouldn't affect anything as long as you don't have %%^Date strings lying around your markdown


[1/11/2023 6:42 PM] rsulfuratus
just looking at your javascript this should be trivial to reimplement as python, it is basically just changing how the metadata is parsed and a few small other things


[1/11/2023 6:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I am also planning on checking metadata in my python script, and if born/built/created is after current year, the page is not built and instead you get a "This <type> doesn't exist yet!" where <type> is replaced by whatever is in type of the yaml frontmatter


[1/11/2023 6:57 PM] rsulfuratus
the page will still exist so as not to break any links but there will be no information on it


[1/11/2023 6:57 PM] .deciusmus
that makes sense


[1/11/2023 8:06 PM] .deciusmus
I'm getting carried away with an NPC template


[1/11/2023 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
great


[1/11/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
how do you feel about prompts?


[1/11/2023 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
like, does it make sense to do Alt-N (for new file from template) pick NPC, and then get prompted for stuff?


[1/11/2023 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
eh. I don't see a huge advantage


[1/11/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
a lot of the time I'm doing something like just click-creating a bunch of npcs from session notes and would prefer to just create all the pages and then fill in metadata etc later


[1/11/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't really seem faster to have prompts, you still need to type the same text


[1/11/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess one place where it would be useful is if you can select from existing notes, e.g. if we had stuff in the gazetteer with type = region, and when you create an NPC it prompts you to select a home region, create a new one, or skip


[1/11/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
that would keep things organized in the sense that right now I am somewhat inconsistent about how big a "region" is


[1/11/2023 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
but overall I think prompts are more likely to break my workflow then help it


[1/11/2023 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
The main reason to do prompts is I can't figure out how to get the frontmatter and main template to play nice together


[1/11/2023 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
that is, if you have one "NPC" template with both the frontmatter and the bioblock it doesn't really work without prompts


[1/11/2023 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
ah. right. I played around with this for a while when I first started messing with templater. this is why there is a separate NPC-yaml and NPC-header template


[1/11/2023 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
Right now it has the following features:
* Prompt for name
* Try to auto-create species and ancestry from the folder name
* If it can't, prompt for species using the Species\ files as the source for an auto-complete list
* If species is human, prompt for ancestry
* Prompt for gender


[1/11/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
* Prompt for home in the form of "somewhere, town, region"


[1/11/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
auto-link "somewhere", "town", and "region" if they are places with notes, otherwise dont


[1/11/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
populate 
home: 
with
Somewhere, Town, Region

populate
homeRegion with region (never linked)


[1/11/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
right, but what happens if I am writing session notes, come to an NPC that doesn't exist, click the link to auto-create the note in my New Notes folder, and then insert the template into the new note?


[1/11/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
in that situation you'd get a lot of prompts


[1/11/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
unless you moved the note to the right folder first


[1/11/2023 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
there needs to be a "just insert the post yaml stuff" template anyway since we already have (partially filled) yaml blocks for 100+ NPCs that I don't necessarily want to redo


[1/11/2023 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I would suggest an NPC-yaml, NPC-text and NPC template, where the NPC template can have prompts if you like


[1/11/2023 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but realistically I will probably mostly just insert yaml and then insert text


[1/11/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking of a "convert" template which reads an existing file, fixes up the frontmatter, and then recreates with the current text post-pended


[1/11/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
it could potentially even delete existing bio-blocks


[1/11/2023 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be nice


[1/11/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. to convert 100+ npcs to "live bio blocks"


[1/11/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
what about a template that asks you where to move the file to when you insert


[1/11/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
so when the file is in the new note folder, when you insert the template it prompts for where to move it to, and then calculates what it can from there


[1/11/2023 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be useful, yes


[1/11/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I still will make for myself at least a template that inserts a yaml block and a template that inserts the text, but a full "build NPC" template with prompts and a "convert old NPC" template would be very useful. I can always split the build NPC template and remove the prompts if I want


[1/11/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I like having the flexibility to make like a Dunmar template, a dwarf template, etc that inserts partially-filled yaml for things I'm doing a lot of, even if temporary.


[1/11/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
if I'm processing a bunch of Chardonians it is great to copy the default yaml, type in the common fields, make a new hotkey, and just blast through a bunch.


[1/11/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
Well, but my template will do that auto for you if you just do it in the Chardonians folder


[1/11/2023 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
the templater stuff to replace is always in the format <%+ tp.user.<FUNCTIONNAME>(<ARGUMENTS>) %>, right?


[1/11/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/11/2023 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
it won't autofill Chardon as home and Chardonian Empire as homeRegion


[1/11/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
true, although it could


[1/11/2023 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but again, like I said, I'm happy to chop up your stuff for my own workflow if I want to


[1/11/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the first argument to FUNCTIONNAME is always tp, right?


[1/11/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/11/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I almost have the python converter working, there is some fiddliness with properly parsing the arguments


[1/11/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
would it be easier if it wasn't json?


[1/11/2023 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
will templater break if you quote the json? e.g. ```{ "startPrefix": "built", "preExistError": "(not yet build)", "endPrefix": "burned down in"}```


[1/11/2023 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I am using a json module to read it in but it complains because the variable names aren't quoted


[1/11/2023 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
works fine


[1/11/2023 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
still have one bug in the getCampaignValue I'm trying to fix but python converter otherwise almost ready

Not replaced: <%+ tp.users.newFunction(tp, "argument") %>

Regular text
```


[1/11/2023 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
the only thing is that in the json argument to the age function, both the keys and the values need to be in double quotes or the code will throw an error


[1/11/2023 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
does it work if the arg is not specified at all?


[1/11/2023 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
I figured most of the time the defaults are correct


[1/11/2023 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, it used the same defaults as your javascript


[1/11/2023 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed my convert_markdown.py code


[1/11/2023 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't extensively tested but seems like it works


[1/11/2023 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus
will test more later


[1/11/2023 11:03 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed my NPC template


[1/11/2023 11:03 PM] .deciusmus
And a short readme


[1/11/2023 11:03 PM] .deciusmus
Need to update it to read default species/ancestry/homeregion from taelgarConfig.json rather than hardcoded in the javescript


[1/11/2023 11:04 PM] .deciusmus
also, you have to downgrade the template plugin to 1.15.3 from 1.16


[1/11/2023 11:04 PM] .deciusmus
<%+ templates are broken in some places in 1.16


[1/11/2023 11:06 PM] .deciusmus
If I get a chance my next project will be to use the whereabouts stuff to:
* create a JS function like <%+ tp.user.getWhereabouts(tp) %>
* create a JS function like <%+ tp.user.getKnownWhereabouts(tp) %>

Add those to the template


[1/11/2023 11:07 PM] .deciusmus
Then add a converter template that updates the frontmatter and regens the bio block


[1/12/2023 12:24 AM] rsulfuratus
I fiddled around a bit. A couple of issues:
1) Templater appears to be depreciating dynamic commands (https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/issues/913), so probably isn't smart to rely on them extensively. 
2) your template feels too complicated to me to use in general. my issue is that I (very often) don't want to fill in all the NPC information when I create the note. in your basic template the only dynamic element is the ageBasedStuff, but nothing else is read from metadata so if you skip the prompt the template is useless. this is difficult because things like ancestry and origin and home need to be transformed for display

[1/12/2023 12:25 AM] rsulfuratus
I actually now think dataview is the correct solution. the approach would be:


[1/12/2023 12:25 AM] rsulfuratus
1) define a display string that is a mix of markdown and computed values. 
2) define compute the values
3) output the string


[1/12/2023 12:26 AM] rsulfuratus
then the python converter code would read the display string, and compute the values in the same way. would just require that functions are named consistently, so ageString is always generated by get_ageString or something


[1/12/2023 7:25 AM] rsulfuratus
looking at this some more if we use dv.view() it would be possible to keep everything inline and not need the computed markdown string. dv.view takes a javascript file and an argument and returns the result. so you could do `$=await dv.view("/js/custom/getAgeString", { "arg1": "value1", etc })`


[1/12/2023 7:25 AM] rsulfuratus
that would be equivalent to the templater command in most respects


[1/12/2023 7:27 AM] rsulfuratus
There is also a js2py module that could in theory let the python code run the js functions


[1/12/2023 7:31 AM] rsulfuratus
You can also still use your templater code to fill out metadata


[1/12/2023 7:33 AM] .deciusmus
Aha, dv.view is nice


[1/12/2023 7:33 AM] .deciusmus
That’s a good replacement for <%+


[1/12/2023 7:33 AM] .deciusmus
I still think that the best general approach is a template that can rerun itself to refresh and preserve added stuff


[1/12/2023 7:33 AM] .deciusmus
So the idea is if you reinsert the template into an existing file it regens


[1/12/2023 7:34 AM] .deciusmus
That keeps the python divergence low


[1/12/2023 7:34 AM] .deciusmus
Use dataview only for stuff that changes when the file doesn’t change


[1/12/2023 7:35 AM] rsulfuratus
the tricky bit is all the reformatting and linking


[1/12/2023 7:36 AM] rsulfuratus
well, I guess I mean in your template it is all mixed up with prompts and other stuff I don't want to use


[1/12/2023 7:38 AM] rsulfuratus
having a template you can insert that uses tp.frontmatter/javascript plus dv.view for dynamic elements is fine


[1/12/2023 8:30 AM] .deciusmus
I don't have a lot of time for this today, but basically I think that using big dataview blocks is a pain because it is hard to fix/change them.

My ultimate goal would be something that is very easy to update dozens/hundreds of files when the template changes


[1/12/2023 8:58 AM] .deciusmus
So I was able to write a template that added a yaml element to frontmatter.


[1/12/2023 8:59 AM] .deciusmus
I think it would be pretty easy to have a template that just regenerates the bio block based on the latest frontmatter


[1/12/2023 8:59 AM] .deciusmus
Using dataview for the age bit


[1/12/2023 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
do you mean automatically regenerates if it detects metadata changes, or that you reinsert to replace old text?


[1/12/2023 9:00 AM] rsulfuratus
I have a meeting at 9:30 but am hoping to push before then a template you can insert in a file that has yaml already and that produces the correct bio block using both templater and dataviewjs, so we can see what we think


[1/12/2023 9:04 AM] .deciusmus
I have a hotkey - CTL-ALT-A
it just updates the file


[1/12/2023 9:04 AM] .deciusmus
you click into the file and hit ctl-alt-a and the bio block magically updates based on current yaml


[1/12/2023 9:04 AM] rsulfuratus
ah nice


[1/12/2023 9:04 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, it doesn't actuall work ye


[1/12/2023 9:04 AM] .deciusmus
and the moment it just adds a date to prove the concept


[1/12/2023 9:08 AM] .deciusmus
But I agree that prompts are not ideal. Here is what I was thinking:

The NPC template is wired to a hotkey. When you press it, it does the following to the current file:

* Adds any "core" NPC yaml tags that are missing
* If the species, ancestry, home tags are blank, it tries to calculate from the current folder (if they are set, it preserves them)
* If there is an age tag it removes it and sets the born tag based on current fantasy calendar date
* If the name tag doesn't match the title it fixes it to match the title

Once that is done, it regenerates the header block (i.e. h1 title + bio block) from the current yaml


[1/12/2023 9:09 AM] .deciusmus
In the bio block it makes everything static except the "age status" string


[1/12/2023 9:09 AM] rsulfuratus
I wouldn't change the name tag


[1/12/2023 9:10 AM] rsulfuratus
if there are two NPCs with the same name, you need the files to be "Zevi of the Ko'zula" and "Zevi of the Bek'eni" to avoid link collisons


[1/12/2023 9:10 AM] rsulfuratus
but the name should just be "Zevi"


[1/12/2023 9:10 AM] .deciusmus
right


[1/12/2023 9:10 AM] .deciusmus
makes sense


[1/12/2023 9:12 AM] .deciusmus
Other bits would include:
* Add a dataview to generate the current whereabouts from the whereabouts tag
* Fix the getAgeStatus to read the "dead" value from YAML, i.e. for Arcus you want it to be petrified but when you regen the bio block that would go away


[1/12/2023 9:12 AM] .deciusmus
* Read the folder -> place / species / ancestory mapping from json config


[1/12/2023 9:12 AM] .deciusmus
Some more speculative ideas:


[1/12/2023 9:14 AM] .deciusmus
* Set the NPC/campaign/met|unmet|unaware via session note backlink searches (but is it valid to say as a default all npcs in session notes should be met?)
* Set the lastPartySeenDate via session note backlink session (as long as session notes have a standardized date in the frontmatter) (again, is this worthwhile?)


[1/12/2023 9:14 AM] .deciusmus
Finally, you could imagine the whole thing keying on type


[1/12/2023 9:14 AM] rsulfuratus
"Set the NPC/campaign/met|unmet|unaware via session note backlink searches (but is it valid to say as a default all npcs in session notes should be met?)"

No, definitely not. Any NPC in session notes should be at least "aware", but plenty of them are not "met"


[1/12/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
I don't think it is worth the hassle trying to autocode NPC tags, to be honest.


[1/12/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
I really prefer to think about this a bit


[1/12/2023 9:15 AM] .deciusmus
So you could add a similarly architected "Building" yaml/bioblock and then if the type: building was set it would generate the same type of data for a building


[1/12/2023 9:16 AM] .deciusmus
and you could do the same for a place


[1/12/2023 9:16 AM] .deciusmus
etc


[1/12/2023 9:16 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, keying on type would be great. NPC and Building would get the most use I think


[1/12/2023 9:17 AM] .deciusmus
I was envisioning 4 ones that I'd use:
- NPC
- Ruler
- Place
- Building


[1/12/2023 9:17 AM] .deciusmus
Ruler is basically just NPC with regnal dates added


[1/12/2023 9:17 AM] rsulfuratus
what would Place be? the main thing I can see I guess is tagging systematic regions


[1/12/2023 9:17 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. so you could query all the place notes in Dunmar


[1/12/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
So for my Cleenseau campaign I have lots of little details about each little hamlet


[1/12/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
population, for example


[1/12/2023 9:18 AM] rsulfuratus
ah right population, pronunciation, that sort of thing.


[1/12/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
whether that's worth having in yaml I'm not sure but its kinda nice


[1/12/2023 9:18 AM] rsulfuratus
I haven't bothered with that for anything


[1/12/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
I would actually love to have some way of auto-inserting distances between places


[1/12/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
Right, because we move around a lot


[1/12/2023 9:19 AM] .deciusmus
My campaign is going to spend the first 10-12 sessions all within a small region


[1/12/2023 9:19 AM] rsulfuratus
also because there just aren't that many hamlets in Dunmar


[1/12/2023 9:19 AM] .deciusmus
So it is worth developing in a fair bit of detail


[1/12/2023 9:20 AM] rsulfuratus
distance between places is tricky. although there is a way to read cvs with dataview, so one could imagine looking up origin, destination in a big spreadsheet


[1/12/2023 9:20 AM] rsulfuratus
but that would not translate to the web well at all


[1/12/2023 9:21 AM] .deciusmus
but you could just do it in templater


[1/12/2023 9:21 AM] .deciusmus
have a CSV of distances and some yaml frontmatter like:

nearby_places: [a, b, c]


[1/12/2023 9:21 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would be nice


[1/12/2023 9:21 AM] rsulfuratus
that's a good idea


[1/12/2023 9:21 AM] .deciusmus
and then the template would generate something like:

Travel times:
* Rinburg, blah blah


[1/12/2023 9:22 AM] .deciusmus
you could even get fancy and have the data provide a "good road", "bad road", "river" and then use some factor to generate time on foot / time on horse


[1/12/2023 9:22 AM] .deciusmus
honestly that would be a lot of value to me as the pcs start moving around the region and start asking how long it will take to get place to palace


[1/12/2023 9:23 AM] rsulfuratus
if you want to get fancy you could use templater to autogenerate a table


[1/12/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
I have a meeting soon and will be busy until about 3 after that although may fiddle on my lunch break


[1/12/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
I just pushed to the repo a commit that has _templates/templates/NPC-text-dataview.md


[1/12/2023 9:25 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, I have a lot of work coding to do, but might fiddle a bit this evening or during lunch


[1/12/2023 9:26 AM] rsulfuratus
_templates/templates/NPC-text-dataview.md works to generate a bioblock (might need a little bug checking) based on your original NPC template, but it inserts a dv.view line


[1/12/2023 9:27 AM] rsulfuratus
probably should refactor a bit to extract functions into a separate js file, either via templater user functions or with customjs (which would allow reusing the same functions in dataview blocks, if desired)


[1/12/2023 9:28 AM] rsulfuratus
there is also some other bits I wrote in metadataUtils.js for customjs - e.g. I was working on a general reformater function that takes a string, reformats it, and returns the reformatted value or different string if blank. might be worth using that instead of all the custom one-off reformatting code, for example


[1/12/2023 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Had two meetings canceled so messed around a bit over the past hour. Trying to reorg a bit. New _scripts folder with customJS and dv.view() code, trying to move most of the js out of the template and into a customJS class


[1/12/2023 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
NPC-dataview-text is template that inserts header and bio, using inline dataviewjs for date


[1/12/2023 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
A few bugs but mostly working


[1/12/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
Right now the metadataUtils class has functions for static metadata only, and the things that depend on age/campaign will be dv.view code. The template autogenerates the dv.view code


[1/12/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
In metadataUtils functions with TP_ should probably be moved to templater user scripts as they depend on the tp object and can’t be reused


[1/12/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Going to work on that during my lunch break and then do real work


[1/12/2023 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
So I'm working on a totally different approach than you 🙂


[1/12/2023 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
what are you doing?


[1/12/2023 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
the auto-regen template stuff


[1/12/2023 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah but can't you just grab the templater code I have and use it?


[1/12/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
maybe?


[1/12/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
I'm mostly working at the obisidan vault API level


[1/12/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
and raw-string manipulation in javascript


[1/12/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
but the idea is a templater template that reads the file, fixes up metadata, prints out a new bioblock and then appends all the text after the bioblock unchanged right?


[1/12/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/12/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
so somewhere in there you still need a templater template to generate the bioblock


[1/12/2023 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
so I can definitely use the bioblock for the most part


[1/12/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
that is all I have done is the templater code to generate the bioblock


[1/12/2023 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/12/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
```
# <% tp.frontmatter.name %>
>[!info]+ Basic information
><% speciesDisplayValue %><% ancestryDisplayValue %><% pronounDisplayValue %>
>`$=dv.view("<% dViewPath %>get_PageDatedValue", {"currentYear" : (dv.current().yearOverride ? dv.current().yearOverride : FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0].current.year), "existYear" : <% existYear %>})`
><% originDisplayValue %>
><% homeDisplayValue %>
```


[1/12/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
it is basically this


[1/12/2023 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
(with a javascript header)


[1/12/2023 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
plus some reorg of javascripts so that the scripts called by dv.view, the generic manipulation methods from customJS and the custom functions for templater are all organized properly


[1/12/2023 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
since they all require slightly different formats


[1/12/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so in theory if you have a "GENERATE BIOBLOCK HERE" section of your template you should be able to just grab my template and stick it there


[1/12/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
if your entire template was:

<%* tp.user.generateBioblock() %>

that would be nicer for me


[1/12/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
my code has an array of strings and uses obsidian to re-write the file


[1/12/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
so I can't actually type stuff into the template -- its all javascript


[1/12/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
this works:

    newFileContent.push("<% tp.date.now() %>")


[1/12/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
but it is a bit of a pain to have a lot of crap in that statement


[1/12/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
there is probably a different way to do it, but I need to insert the content in the middle of the file


[1/12/2023 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that should be possible


[1/12/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
ah hmm actually maybe not


[1/12/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
actually


[1/12/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure if the templater user functions have access to customJS and FantasyCalendar api


[1/12/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
I was using fantasy calendar API


[1/12/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure about customJs


[1/12/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
window.FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0].current.year


[1/12/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
works


[1/12/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
customJs isn't critical; I just wrote a few generic functions (to reformat metadata strings, get pronouns, and a few other small things) that could be useful to reuse elsewhere


[1/12/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but could also just dump those functions in the generateBioblock() function


[1/12/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
actually the right way to do it is probably generateHeader(tp) and then depending on tp.frontmatter.type you can generate the correct header. would actually fix a lot of the messiness with the logic in getPageDatedValue if we could assume if type=Person that yearStart = born, yearEnd = died, etc


[1/12/2023 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/12/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
let me fiddle a bit but that will be my goal is a <%* tp.user.generateHeader(tp) %> template that creates the markdown + dv.view inline code for a header


[1/12/2023 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
then just need to fix my python script to parse functions as "`$=dv.view" instead of "<%*"


[1/12/2023 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
but that is easy


[1/12/2023 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
just a bit of regex fiddling


[1/12/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
have you tried using a tp.user.FUNCTION call instead another tp.user function? I guess in theory if I pass the tp object all the user functions should get passed as well


[1/12/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
otherwise the code will get messy


[1/12/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I have not tried it


[1/12/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
it works


[1/12/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
but I think it should work from the tp


[1/12/2023 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
this is the entire template you need for the bioblock: 
```
<%* 
const configFilePath = app.vault.getRoot().path + ".obsidian/taelgarConfig.json";
let configFile = await app.vault.adapter.read(configFilePath);
let output = tp.user.generateHeader(tp,configFile) 
%>
<% output %>
```


[1/12/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
can't use await functions in tp.user so need to pass the configFile, but if you already load that elsewhere in your code then it could just be: 
`<%* tp.user.generateHeader(tp,configFile) %><% output %>`


[1/12/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
oops need the `let output = ` in there


[1/12/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
cool


[1/12/2023 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
is it ok if I pass the parsed json object for the config file instead of the raw string


[1/12/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that's fine


[1/12/2023 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
so in theory I don't even need a template


[1/12/2023 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
I can just run your generateHeader


[1/12/2023 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
and then dump that in the filestream I'm re-writing


[1/12/2023 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah you could, it returns a multi-line markdown string


[1/12/2023 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm. it takes the tp object and the config json as inputs


[1/12/2023 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
it needs access to tp.frontmatter and tp.user


[1/12/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
the tp.frontmatter won't be accurate


[1/12/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
at the moment I think you have to do a 2-pass to get it to work


[1/12/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
so I have ctl-alt-m to refresh the template


[1/12/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
so you have to do c-a-m to update the template and then alt-r to replace templates in active file


[1/12/2023 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
generateHeader could take metadata and config if I move the location parsing functions inside the generateHeader code


[1/12/2023 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
ah hmm might still need access to tp for the tp.file.find_tfile in the location code


[1/12/2023 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but honestly a command to refresh yaml and a command to refresh templates is not really an issue


[1/12/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/12/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
agreed


[1/12/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
the last thing I am doing is rewriting the PageDatedValue function so that it reads values for startPrefix, endPrefix, etc from metadata, otherwise each refresh will just set it back to defaults


[1/12/2023 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
but I'm also going to base the defaults based on the type yaml value. for item will be created/destroyed, for npc will be born/died, for ruler will be born/died, and for building will be built/destroyed.


[1/12/2023 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
these can be overwritten by metadata values but I'm getting rid of the strings argument

👍

[1/12/2023 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
okay it looks like it all works


[1/12/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
templateFunction template / generateHeader js works for type=NPC and type=Ruler, possibly with a few small visual bugs to fix if there are lots of missing values


[1/12/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
what am I missing?


[1/12/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
i'm getting dataview errors


[1/12/2023 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
Ok. It is working. I will push later, just not at my PC right now and don't currently have git setup on my surface


[1/12/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
Here is what I have:

Update Note template.
* Bind it to a hotkey
* Hit the hotkey
* Hit Alt-R to rerun templates

The update note template will:
* Insert any missing metadata elements
* Populate default values for the metadata elements based on folder data
* Preserve any unrecognized metadata elements
* Delete everything between the end of the YAML frontmatter and the first blank line
* Insert your template into just below the YAML frontmatter


[1/12/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
Hitting Alt-R will rerun the active template


[1/12/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
So the workflow is basically:
- Edit frontmatter


[1/12/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
- Hit Alt-W / Alt-R


[1/12/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
The bioblock is updated


[1/12/2023 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
Bonus features:
- If we add new yaml elements they will be inserted
- auto-pop of yaml elements based on folder structure


[1/12/2023 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
If the note is Untitled or contains only the single word RERUN it will prompt for NPC / age/ gender (and calc birth year from age)


[1/12/2023 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
.taelgarConfig drives the auto-pop so we can have different settings. There are three parts:

rootTypes. A map from the folder root (i.e. people, campaigns, etc) to a type: value. 

Example:
```
  "rootTypes": {
    "People": "NPC",
    "Gazetteer": "Place",
    "Thing": "Item"
  },
```

typeKeys. A map from a type (read from the root types, above, or the type: in the YAML) to yaml keys that should be present.

Example:
```
  "typeKeys" : {
    "NPC" : ["species", "born", "ancestry", "gender", "died", "home", "homeRegion", "origin", "originRegion", "affiliations" ],
    "Building" : ["built", "destroyed", "location", "locationRegion" ],
    "Place" : ["founded", "destroyed", "population", "prouncation", "location", "locationRegion"],
    "Item" : ["created", "destroyed", "currentOwner", "maker"]
  },
```


[1/12/2023 9:50 PM] .deciusmus
typeKeyDefaults. A map of maps from a type and leaf folder to list of key-value pairs. This defines the default values for a yaml element.

Example:
```
 "typeKeyDefaults" : {
    "NPC" : {
      "Sembarans" : {"species" : "human"}
    }
  }
}
```

This says that if the type is NPC, and the leaf folder of the file is Sembarans, then set the species value (if it is not in the yaml at all) to human.


[1/12/2023 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
Question: Should it replace

```species:```

with 

```species: human```

or only do that if the yaml element is truly missing?


[1/12/2023 11:24 PM] rsulfuratus
replacing `species: ` with `species: human` is fine. if you truly want species unknown, you would not rely on blank metadata and instead set `species: unknown`


[1/12/2023 11:37 PM] rsulfuratus
this is pretty awesome


[1/12/2023 11:44 PM] rsulfuratus
one small thing - there should be a way to set tags based on type. in particular I want all new NPCs I make to get NPC/unsorted as a default tag. maybe the best option would be default tags in the taelgarConfig.json, although it might make sense for us to agree on what the default tags should be


[1/13/2023 12:02 AM] rsulfuratus
the adding new metadata fields needs some debugging, it does not appear to work


[1/13/2023 12:05 AM] rsulfuratus
if I have a yaml section that is just:
```
---
type=NPC
---
```


[1/13/2023 12:06 AM] rsulfuratus
sometimes I get "unable to determine file type" error, and sometimes I get this: 
```
---
type: NPC
affiliations:
<% tp.user.generateHeader(tp) %>
```


[1/13/2023 12:07 AM] rsulfuratus
but for notes that already have metadata it works great to insert and update new template


[1/13/2023 12:12 AM] rsulfuratus
there has to be some kind of race condition, because some of the time it will delete a random line instead of just the template


[1/13/2023 7:25 AM] .deciusmus
I may play with it a bit later today


[1/13/2023 7:25 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think separating the regen header from the metadata is the right thing to do


[1/13/2023 7:37 AM] .deciusmus
So I was thinking three templates:
- regen header block, does nothing if not a recognized type


[1/13/2023 7:37 AM] .deciusmus
- quick-set metadata, uses the folder scheme to set defaults, never prompts


[1/13/2023 7:38 AM] .deciusmus
- set metadata, prompts for things it can’t figure out


[1/13/2023 7:38 AM] .deciusmus
- new file template, runs the metadata set and then adds the header block


[1/13/2023 7:39 AM] .deciusmus
(That’s 4)


[1/13/2023 7:39 AM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense to me


[1/13/2023 7:41 AM] rsulfuratus
presumably the quick-set metadata and the set metadata both also clean up yaml, injecting missing frontmatter


[1/13/2023 7:55 AM] .deciusmus
right


[1/13/2023 7:55 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a regen header template


[1/13/2023 7:56 AM] .deciusmus
It seems pretty robust. There are some file-edit race conditions so rarely if you JUST edited a file and then run the template it can mess up changes. Basically I think that the tp.file.contents is sometimes a bit stale and then things get wonky. It's best to not be TOO fast.


[1/13/2023 7:57 AM] .deciusmus
The regen header will fail if there is no type in the yaml, but if the type is set it assumes you have some kind of header for the type


[1/13/2023 8:45 AM] .deciusmus
yes, that is the idea


[1/13/2023 8:47 AM] .deciusmus
One thing I was wondering is whether it would be better to have the metadata in folders, i.e. rather than in the JSON, what if each folder could have a _metadata.md


[1/13/2023 8:49 AM] rsulfuratus
not really a huge fan of that


[1/13/2023 8:50 AM] rsulfuratus
feels like it adds a lot of clutter and auto-filling metadata is not actually a big advantage. realistically the main things you can autofill are species and ancestry, and maybe homeRegion


[1/13/2023 8:53 AM] rsulfuratus
I think you might pre-invent a lot more NPC detail for your game than I do for mine - most commonly NPCs come into existence during play and then I backfill information later, so auto-setting stuff isn't that useful. and often I don't want to invent too much before the NPC exists, so if I'm doing session prep I would tend to leave a lot of fields blank anyway


[1/13/2023 8:56 AM] .deciusmus
What about a single file that defines the basics that are blank?


[1/13/2023 8:56 AM] .deciusmus
Ie rather than the list in the json


[1/13/2023 8:56 AM] rsulfuratus
what is the advantage to having it in a md file in a folder?


[1/13/2023 8:56 AM] .deciusmus
It’s shared between us


[1/13/2023 8:57 AM] .deciusmus
And it is easier to do something like have the sembaran royalty have a ruler template


[1/13/2023 8:58 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm


[1/13/2023 8:58 AM] .deciusmus
I could also do something like have full folder matches for type


[1/13/2023 8:58 AM] .deciusmus
In the json


[1/13/2023 8:58 AM] rsulfuratus
I would probably set it up where there is a shared config file (metadata.json) that lives in .obsidian but we can add to the .gitignore


[1/13/2023 9:00 AM] rsulfuratus
for type, I would do the following:
1) if there is type already in the yaml, great, go from that
2) if not, and if the folder matches a known auto-generated path in the json config, set based on that
3) otherwise, prompt with a drop down menu to fill type


[1/13/2023 9:01 AM] rsulfuratus
this is actually where prompts might be useful - setting up complicated rules to try to guess type won't always get it right (for example, there are organizations in the People directory that shouldn't get NPC type, and both Bulidings and Places live in Gazetteer)


[1/13/2023 9:02 AM] rsulfuratus
better to match exact paths, so you can do something like set the sembaran royalty path to speed up adding headers for the 30 or so notes you have


[1/13/2023 9:03 AM] rsulfuratus
but for generic use, if you are just adding one note, a prompt is fine. and if you don't like prompts it is easy to just insert type, e.g. we could make a template for new-NPC, new-Item etc that would just set type = X, tags = [stub] or something


[1/13/2023 9:04 AM] .deciusmus
I could do path regex es


[1/13/2023 9:05 AM] .deciusmus
Ie have the structure be :
Type -> list of folder reflexes


[1/13/2023 9:05 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would work


[1/13/2023 9:06 AM] rsulfuratus
I think a prompt if it can't figure it out would be nice as well though if it isn't too complicated.


[1/13/2023 9:06 AM] .deciusmus
That is super easy


[1/13/2023 9:08 AM] .deciusmus
So we’d have a metadata.json (shared) that defines the folder->type and type-> frontmatter


[1/13/2023 9:08 AM] .deciusmus
A taelgarconfig (not shared) that defines the campaign prefix, dv-path, and folder -> default values


[1/13/2023 9:09 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, that sounds great


[1/13/2023 9:09 AM] .deciusmus
The basic new note template would fill type, insert front matter, and prompt for type is not able to determine


[1/13/2023 9:09 AM] .deciusmus
(And add the header block)


[1/13/2023 9:10 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/13/2023 9:10 AM] .deciusmus
Then I might make a prompting-version of that which prompts for many things


[1/13/2023 9:11 AM] rsulfuratus
right, the new note template could have a "plain" and a "prompt-heavy" version


[1/13/2023 9:12 AM] rsulfuratus
I mean as long as the text output is not changed (so we aren't constantly git reverting each other) we can use different workflows


[1/13/2023 9:12 AM] .deciusmus
Another question— if the note is untitled should it prompt for name


[1/13/2023 9:12 AM] rsulfuratus
yes that it very useful


[1/13/2023 9:22 AM] rsulfuratus
languages might be a useful thing to add to the NPC template


[1/13/2023 9:23 AM] rsulfuratus
also I have been "overloading" affliations for things like dwarven clan, thuhr, halfling family, orc horde


[1/13/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
but one could imagine breaking that into actual affiliations (mostly limited to things that are organizations; this would probably include thuhr but not clan/family) and some generic family/clan/etc


[1/13/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
could also use ancestry for some of this


[1/13/2023 9:34 AM] .deciusmus
I was thinking for NPCs "family" might be a nice tag


[1/13/2023 9:34 AM] .deciusmus
for houses of rulers, dwarf clans, etc


[1/13/2023 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
right. I was thinking about this because I wanted to have a dataview query to pull up all the charmhearts on the charmhearts page, for example


[1/13/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
fyi when I have been adding the new header, if there is location information I've be putting it on a separate line below the header, like:

👍

[1/13/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
that way it won't get messed up by header regenerations


[1/13/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
once we add location to the header we can delete those lines


[1/13/2023 10:02 AM] rsulfuratus
for items, a magical (T/F or yes/no) tag might be nice


[1/13/2023 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
I just pushed a few bugfixes


[1/13/2023 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
FYI


[1/13/2023 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
not related to this, but I've been playing with the obsidian leaflet plugin - don't think it is really translatable to the web so not using it too much for public facing maps, but it is really easy to just turn an image zoomable and linkable for session prep


[1/13/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
ok... fixing some more bugs


[1/13/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
there are race conditions between the cached data and the on disk data


[1/13/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
the tp.xxx content is not accurate 100% of the time if you've just modified the file


[1/13/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
so I need to move away from tp.<blah> to app.vault.adapter.read


[1/13/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
etc


[1/13/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
this means my scripts ALWAYS work on the on-disk version of the file. That means if you make change and then run the script immediately afterward, it is possible that obsidian won't have saved the file to disk before the script runs, and so it might not see you most recent change


[1/13/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
In general it shouldn't happen but I can recreate it in testing by moving fast enough


[1/13/2023 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
so the main issue I guess would be that if you hit the rebuild header immediately after updating metadata, you might lose your updated metadata?


[1/13/2023 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
one thing I noticed is that you get a popup "file modified by external source, automatically merging" at least most (all) of the time when you are overwriting your most recent edits


[1/13/2023 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
so at least you potentially get a warning that something is off if you do hit it


[1/13/2023 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
my bugfixes should help make that popup go away


[1/13/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
but I don't think you will even generally lose your updated metadata as obsidian merges sensibly


[1/13/2023 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/13/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
just save the file before running stuff helps


[1/13/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
i do ctl-s, alt-t


[1/13/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
(where alt-t is my hotfix for the template)


[1/13/2023 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
there is a plugin called QuickAdd that lets you create macros


[1/13/2023 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
could easily make a: save note, insert template, reload template macro


[1/13/2023 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
also, I think I am inclined to move away from a "Ruins and Lairs" folder and just use tags/headers.


[1/13/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
one more metadata thought - putting D&D beyond links in metadata for magic items could be nice, then you could generate a [Mechanics](dndbeyondlink) link in the header


[1/13/2023 12:33 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/13/2023 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
we are going to new york this weekend and I have a lot of stuff to do for work before our flight, so haven't looked at any of this; but likely to spend my time on the flight/airport working on this


[1/13/2023 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the replace header template makes things very fast for just replacing the old headers with the new headers (and it is kind of fun to see how old all your NPCs are now)


[1/13/2023 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus
getting the metadata cleanup stuff will be great but also the main point will be to take the old metadata and insert new stuff, so can iterate on it over time


[1/13/2023 12:36 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/13/2023 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I have to prep for Monday's session over the weekend (and might be running a game for Isaac too) so I'm not likely to mess around with javascript much for a while


[1/13/2023 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
so if you are largely working on templates and scripts offline won't be an issue


[1/13/2023 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/13/2023 12:39 PM] .deciusmus
Just to summarize:

* The header stuff is working well; the regen part, which is the key bit for fixing old files is pretty much done

* We want a script that "cleans and creates" metadata as per the earlier conversation -- basically a way to 
(1) quickly set metadata on a file that has no metadata at all and is just some notes about an npc written in-game or ported from onenote/gdrive
(2) when writing a file from scratch, provide a way to quickly initialize the metadata
(3) provide a way to update/standardize metadata as we think of new fields to add


[1/13/2023 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to assume for the frontmatter update script the three key usecases are:

* Totally new file (empty & untitled)
* Minimal file (right npc name, maybe 1-2 sentences, no metadata)
* Kinda-updated file with some metadata but perhaps missing some pieces


[1/13/2023 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
The goal for totally new file is to figure out the type and name (via prompts) and then initi.

The goal for minimal file is add the metadata and header without prompts preserving the header


[1/13/2023 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
The goal for kinda-updated is to add in the new metadata


[1/13/2023 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
I think for all of those, I will focus on no-prompting. So the template will only ever prompt for name (if untitled) and type (if it can't figure it out)


[1/13/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that all makes sense


[1/13/2023 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
I might then for my own amusement write a "populate metadata" template that prompts for each piece of missing metadata


[1/13/2023 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
In particular, I like the ablity to have an "Age" prompt calculate the born period, as I often have a sense of "this npc should be about 45" and just just type 42 or 45 but doing the math for "what year should they have been born" is harder


[1/13/2023 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
one question I guess is if the metadata update script should insert (blank) yaml lines for strictly optional stuff - either something like yearOverride (mostly a debugging tool, so probably no), or the optional things to change the endPrefix, endStatus, etc in the age stuff


[1/13/2023 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
don't want yaml to get too out of control but might make sense to organize it a bit with comments


[1/13/2023 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I am going to write a doc that outlines all the yaml used in the header generation code for reference, so we can think about this


[1/13/2023 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
metadata table pushed fyi


[1/13/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is best to only populate "key" fields as blank.


[1/13/2023 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
I dont think we need name as distinct from title btw


[1/13/2023 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
do we really need to set the name for an Inn or something?


[1/13/2023 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
I guess maybe


[1/13/2023 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
actually, I guess it is a good idea


[1/13/2023 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
For now I'm going to setup the metadata stuff to add anything that is flagged as core in your file but not the optional


[1/13/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
I think a few of the not-impl would be sensible to be core:

* Whereabouts if the default is just populated from home seems reasonable to have for all npcs. the scripting could ignore the location block if whereabouts == home
* family (for rulers and npcs) although often not set seems worth having in the yaml as it could frequently be set


[1/13/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
in the not-yet-implemented list, I would include as core whereabouts and family as you mention, and also:
- location, locationRegion for buildings and places
- player, campaign for PCs

I am not sure if Item headers will ultimately be that useful, but if you are including them


[1/13/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
- currentOwner
- ddbLink


[1/13/2023 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
That would give you the minimal amount of stuff to generate some initial headers for places, pcs, buildings, and items and see what is useful.

places would be just location/locationRegion stuff; unless we separate out Places and Settlements population is too tricky I think

PCs would be kinda like NPCs but without any location information and with player/campaign information

items would be ddbLink, owner, and created/destroyed if those exist. I think maker is so rarely known/invented that it is probably not worth it for now


[1/13/2023 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also consider setting default tags to : type/unsorted if no tags exist


[1/13/2023 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
probably with Ruler as NPC/unsorted instead of Ruler/unsorted. possibly not bothering for places/buildings. possibly setting PCs to PC/campaign instead of PC/unsorted


[1/13/2023 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
for tags I was basically thinking:

NPC/unsorted
PC/campaign


[1/13/2023 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
oh, and session notes should be a type


[1/13/2023 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
a session note header with real and game dates would be nice


[1/13/2023 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
fc-date and fc-end are used by fantasy calendar


[1/13/2023 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
so are good to use for the dates of events


[1/13/2023 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
*dates of recent/in-game events


[1/13/2023 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
here's my session note frontmatter:

```
fc-calendar: Taelgar Calendar
fc-date: 1719-10-19
fc-end: 1719-10-21
fc-category: Cleenseau Campaign
real-date: 2023-01-08
tags: [session-note, cleenseau-campaign]
```


[1/13/2023 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah session notes as a type would be great


[1/13/2023 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
I might change real-date to realDate (but can't change the fc-xxx)


[1/13/2023 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
and add a campaign tag


[1/13/2023 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I was playing around with that a bit


[1/13/2023 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, I have the advantage of not porting anything from old fomrats


[1/13/2023 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
but I found that breaking stuff up into small events and then tagging dates is really nice


[1/13/2023 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
so for example I have:

[1/13/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
each of those events are tagged with an fc-date and so show up on my calendar


[1/13/2023 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I saw that


[1/13/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
I also have a  Background Events folder that is not published to web


[1/13/2023 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
it is a lot of work to go back and do that for 63 sessions worth of material


[1/13/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
It is almost certainly not worthwhile


[1/13/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to say I also have a Background Events with stuff that is happening that the PCs dont know about


[1/13/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
that I don't publish to the web


[1/13/2023 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
but that way if say I know that bandits will attack the town in 5 days I can see it in my calendar


[1/13/2023 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
so it makes keeping track of what is going on in game much easier because I can just look at the fantasy calendar in play


[1/13/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I have a massive onenote table that has both historical and future events and also npc movements, campaign events, misc other things happening in the world.


[1/13/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
one of the things that got me looking at obsidian in the first place was how utterly annoying that is


[1/13/2023 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Using the fantasy calendar and fc-xxx tags works really well for the small number of events i have so far


[1/13/2023 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah it would be way better but going back to make a note for each day etc is time consuming


[1/13/2023 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually since it is just markdown if I could get my onenote spreadsheet into csv I could write a short python program that would auto-generate a note for each date in the csv file


[1/13/2023 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
hmmm


[1/13/2023 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I assume fantasy calendar is automatically creating events from frontmatter?


[1/13/2023 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking it actually be pretty easy to write a script to parse Friday, Jan 8th, 2021; in Taelgar, evening April 15th through morning April 16th)


[1/13/2023 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
You have to turn it on in settings


[1/13/2023 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I could do that too


[1/13/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
But if you turn it on it will do it


[1/13/2023 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
btw renamed all my session notes to Session NUM (DuFr) so shouldn't have link collisions


[1/13/2023 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
cool


[1/13/2023 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
Productive flight. I’ll try to push something later. Basically implemented everything we talked about earlier. Just missing some prompting stuff

👍

[1/14/2023 9:11 AM] .deciusmus
If you want to edit metadata.json and/or send me a list of what you think types should be I’ll probably mess around a bit more -9pm


[1/14/2023 9:11 AM] rsulfuratus
okay. I'm doing session prep today (running for Isaac tomorrow and you Mon so a lot on my list) but I might mess around a bit. will push updates to metadata.json if I do anything with it


[1/14/2023 9:16 AM] rsulfuratus
the next thing I might mess around with is a dv.view function (done this way so it can be inline and also so my python code can catch it) that lets you put in a date in DR reckoning and get back a date in Sembaran, Dunmari, or Dwarven reckoning.


[1/14/2023 9:17 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. was updating my notes on Avaras and would love to be able to say: "Avaras was born in `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Date", dv.current().born, "Dunmari") and get back 91 Nayan or something


[1/14/2023 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
That would be cool


[1/14/2023 9:31 AM] .deciusmus
Fantasy calendar has an “eras” structure in the json but it doesn’t seem to be implemented


[1/14/2023 9:31 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I looked at that but it didn't seem very robust


[1/14/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
everyone I've made up who is alive in Eastern Dunmar
```dataview
TABLE location, locationRegion, home, homeRegion from "People" WHERE (locationRegion = "Eastern Dunmar" OR homeRegion = "Eastern Dunmar") AND (!died OR died > 1748)
```


[1/14/2023 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
did a little work on the metadata.json (People/PC/Ruler, haven't done Items/Places/Buildings) and tested the new frontmatter code. a few thoughts:

1) some more ideas for metadata including:
a) title (NPC + Ruler). h1 would be title name if title exists, would be nice for things like Speaker Lara / Speaker Candrosa and also all the rulers (Samraat Nayan X), and would lead to consistent file naming (never use title) and h1 (always use title). could even potentially add "title name" as a default alias
b) something to track mechanics a bit; not sure if "class" would be useful exactly, but a simple way to track who can cast what kind of spells and similar class-like abilities would be extremely useful. Maybe this doesn't need to be stored in metadata, although having it querable could be useful


[1/14/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
2) based on a tiny bit of experimental I believe you can use comments in the yaml frontmatter, with #. given this it would be amazing if we could get the updateFrontmatter code to reorganize to put each yaml item in a section; as the amount of yaml grows this is nice to have. maybe something like this (manually done):
```
---
type: NPC
## bio ##
name: Lara
species: human
ancestry: Dunmari
gender: female
## age ##
born: 
died: 
## location ##
home: "Lakan Monastery, Tokra"
homeRegion: Central Dunmar
origin:
originRegion:
whereabouts:
## groups ##
affiliations: ["Lakan Mystai"]
family:
## other ##
yearOverride: 
aliases: []
tags: [NPC/unsorted]
---
```


[1/14/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
right now it looks like the code just inserts new metadata at the end in a somewhat arbitrary order


[1/14/2023 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, something to mess around with. I will probably work on a PC header next, as that is pretty close to the NPC header, and then think about items/places/buildings


[1/14/2023 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
I just pushed a change so that you can use:
{campaign} and {campaignPrefix} in the initial tags in metadata.json and it will be pulled from the like-named values in taelgarConfig.json


[1/14/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
ie. initialTags: [PCs/{campaign}]


[1/14/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
not sure if it makes sense to change, haven't actually changed metadata.json, but the script change is there


[1/14/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
I am also going to push _MoC (map of content) folder with
(a) all the readmes for scripts and stuff
(b) some basic dataquery pages


[1/16/2023 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
I may do another round of messing around on the plane home… either getting whereabouts to work or places… any preference or thoughts?


[1/16/2023 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
whereabouts would be way more useful for running games


[1/16/2023 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
places might need a bit of thought about what a header looks like


[1/16/2023 12:36 PM] .deciusmus
My basic thought on whereabouts would be to:
- have the header show the current whereabouts via a dataview query


[1/16/2023 12:36 PM] .deciusmus
- support last known whereabouts if the party last seen date is set


[1/16/2023 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah that would be ideal


[1/16/2023 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
- bonus points would be some way for you to have secret whereabouts


[1/16/2023 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
That would just be a GitHub filter


[1/16/2023 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
But can you add a filter in the yaml?


[1/16/2023 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
I guess you could have an npc that entirely strips


[1/16/2023 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right we talked about a secret:1 element in the yaml


[1/16/2023 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
don't even need that, obsidian understands yaml comments, so you'd just have ## secret at the end of a whereabouts line that needs to be filtered


[1/16/2023 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
although would need to confirm that the tp code passes along comments unmodified


[1/16/2023 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
otherwise could just have secret: 1 in the yaml


[1/16/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but if you get whereabouts working I can test whether comments get messed up and if so figure out another option


[1/16/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
this works though:


[1/16/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus

[1/16/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
and adding `born: 1696 ##secret year`


[1/16/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
works fine for the dv.view code


[1/16/2023 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and running the process note template code with yaml comments correctly updates the missing frontmatter fields without changing the comments


[1/16/2023 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
if you are bored on the plane, I potentially need up to 36 names of Drankorian emperors for tonight...


[1/16/2023 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have any kind of framework already for some Drankorian emperors?


[1/16/2023 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
generally names are either Greek or Elvish, depending on whether they are of Peronar (half-elven) or Hkaran (human) ancestry


[1/16/2023 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I've got three around Caulaus' era (Helea, Vestian, Euros)


[1/16/2023 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
and the first 10 or so done


[1/16/2023 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a long golden age of peace and prosperity from ~628 - 965 or so, basically ending with Helea's reign and the events Caulaus sort of remembers, that has 13 total emperors ending with Helea


[1/16/2023 1:52 PM] .deciusmus

I'm keeping the latter history of the Drankorian empire secret for now, but for Sembaran history, here is the relevant section of the era of northward expansion

[1/16/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
oops thought markdown would work


[1/16/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
should be able to copy to obsidian to get a nice table


[1/16/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
oh also: 
| Kylanthe (f)               | First Peace    | Hkar             | Negotiated final settlement of Sembaran wars                                                                | 451        | 499      | 48          | 4584    |


[1/16/2023 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
Mostly got whereabouts working


[1/16/2023 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
Need to implement the current party stuff.


[1/16/2023 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
One annoying thing is that it potentially needs a full date, so the export version of it will need a full date


[1/16/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
Also not sure how it should interact with home region. Currently if whereabouts isn’t set, it populates the initial whereabouts using the home region and born year to set a whereabouts equal to the born year for the home region


[1/16/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/16/2023 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
that should be fine for most purposes


[1/16/2023 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
there are people who came from elsewhere but probably should manually edit whereabouts for those people if needed


[1/16/2023 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/16/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
But is it worth having both a “home/based in” and a “current location”?


[1/16/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
For most it’s likely to be the same


[1/16/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
right, maybe with whereabouts implemented then home/homregion is redundant


[1/16/2023 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
I could delete home region and home when I add whereabouts


[1/16/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
the original idea was that most NPCs are pinned to a particular location, so home / homeRegion was that location


[1/16/2023 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
origin / originLocation was used to keep track of npcs from elsewhere (e.g., to get a list of Chardonians in Darba or something)


[1/16/2023 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
location / locationRegion for NPCs that moved around


[1/16/2023 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
but whereabouts kind of includes all of those cases


[1/16/2023 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
the only annoying thing is having to specify a date when someone moved from where they were born to where they live now, which I might not want to have to make up for anyone not from their hometown


[1/16/2023 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
or rather there is no problem with adding an arbitrary born + 10 years for home / homeRegion, but I want a way to distinguish between "this is an actual date that has been introduced in the world and changing it would retcon something" from "this is an arbitrary date that is needed to allow origin and home to be different"


[1/16/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
I think one day is the right amount of time


[1/16/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
That’s obviously fake


[1/16/2023 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is good. I think particularly for shared NPCs, the implication is that if they moved 1 day after they were born then we should feel free to shift the date


[1/16/2023 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[1/16/2023 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
So then I would generate between 0 and 3 lines


[1/16/2023 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
If no whereabouts, 0


[1/16/2023 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
If a single entry, a single line for that entry


[1/16/2023 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm


[1/16/2023 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
Let me think…


[1/16/2023 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
are you thinking for the header? or for converting the current origin/home/location to whereabouts?


[1/16/2023 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
It’s hard to tell the difference between “origin” and “home” vs “home” and “some recent location”


[1/16/2023 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
The header


[1/16/2023 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
To convert id set origin as birth year 01-01, and home as birth year 01-02


[1/16/2023 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
for the header, I'd do the following:

1) get origin location as a string
2) get current location as a string

If origin location equals current location, print current location. If origin location doesn't equal current location, print Originally from and Currently at


[1/16/2023 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
origin location is always location at birth, so that is easy


[1/16/2023 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
it does mean that the header for someone who is based in a place that is not their origin, and is also currently not at the place they are based in, wouldn't indicate where they are based / usually found


[1/16/2023 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
it also means that you can't specify location unless you specify birth year, which might be a bit annoying for like generic innkeepers or something where you care about location more than age


[1/16/2023 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
it might be worth keeping the current home/origin metadata, and just reporting the location as we do know for anyone where whereabouts are empty, to be honest


[1/16/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
I could set 01-01-0001 as the date for unknown people


[1/16/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
And “fix it” if you set born


[1/16/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
oh that would be nice


[1/16/2023 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
lets use YYYY-MM-DD though instead of DD-MM-YYYY


[1/16/2023 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
It’s easy to make “originally from” and “currently at” work, I just don’t know if we need a 3rd line


[1/16/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Sorry yes it actually has to be yyyy-mm-dd for yaml to parse it I think


[1/16/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
One option would be to introduce an optional “basedIn”


[1/16/2023 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I don't think a third line is necessary honestly. I can only think of like two or three NPCs where it might be relevant (home != origin and they move around a lot and I care about their location)


[1/16/2023 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right optional basedIn would be good


[1/16/2023 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Right so how about this:
- convert home/origin as discussed


[1/16/2023 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
- generate 2 header lines if different


[1/16/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
- if there is a optional basedIn and the current location is not equal to based in show a 3rd line (usually in xxx)


[1/16/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Most npcs have one entry. A fee have a bunch of entries but no basedIn. One or two have 3 lines.


[1/16/2023 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that works

you have to change a level I think


[1/16/2023 8:06 PM] .deciusmus
I was playing with this for one of my pcs


[1/16/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
a perfect that fixed it


[1/16/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
So, just to recap, what do we want the whereabouts box to say?


[1/16/2023 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
I have current location & last seen by party working


[1/16/2023 8:08 PM] rsulfuratus
Originally from: XX
Currently (date): XX


[1/16/2023 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
(currently it requires the date entries to be sorted)


[1/16/2023 8:08 PM] rsulfuratus
with optionally Based in: XX if based in is set and different from Currently in:


[1/16/2023 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
so originally from should show as long as it is different from currently?


[1/16/2023 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think so


[1/16/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
so say:

d1: Nardith
d2: Tokra
d3: Somewhere in Dunmar

would show:

originally from Nardith
currently somwhere in Dunmar


[1/16/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
and:


[1/16/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
d1: Tokra
d2: somewhere in Myreni Gap

would show

Originally from Tokra
Currently somewhere in the Myreni Gap


[1/16/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/16/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
but
d1: Chardon

would just show
Currently in Chardon


[1/16/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
as would:


[1/16/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
d1: Chardon
d2: Voltara
d3: Chardon


[1/16/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
basically get most recent location and original location; if different show "Originally from: and Currently in:" separately


[1/16/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
if same show just "Currently in: "


[1/16/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
if BasedIn is set and different from Currently, add "Based in: "


[1/16/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess you could also have it say "Based in: " if originally == currently


[1/16/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
so first check if there is more than one location to show; if yes, show origin + current + (optionally) based


[1/16/2023 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
if no, just show the one location, and report it as "Based in: "


[1/16/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
btw I was thinking rather than having a "based in" I could have a flag excursion or something on the whereabouts line


[1/16/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
ie.

- {date: xxx, place: xxx, region: xxx, excursion: true }


[1/16/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
would indicate that this whereabout shouldn't be used for the "home region" calculation


[1/16/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
I think that's easier for dataview


[1/16/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
for example


[1/16/2023 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense


[1/16/2023 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so then you report origin (first location), home (last non-excursion location), and current (last location)


[1/16/2023 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
where either origin or current are only displayed if they are not equal to home


[1/16/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/16/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
plus last seen by party


[1/16/2023 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that would just be current if last seen by party exists, right? more recent locations would be encoded in the whereabouts and accessible to queries, but shouldn't be exposed in the header


[1/16/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
if different


[1/16/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn't sure


[1/16/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
do you want to see in your notes the current location?


[1/16/2023 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
vs the last seen by party?


[1/16/2023 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
the python export can do it differently


[1/16/2023 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm yeah that's true, that's a good point


[1/16/2023 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
the python would just report last seen, the obsidian dataview should report both


[1/17/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed some work on whereabouts and items


[1/17/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
Probably won't have time to do more until the weekend; but feel free to pass along feedback


[1/17/2023 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
whereabouts is pretty awesome, just had time for a tiny bit of testing


[1/17/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
will probably mess around with my github filters tonight before regenerating tons of headers


[1/17/2023 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
The main missing bit on whereabouts is the python equivalent


[1/17/2023 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
Also do like the double ident? (Ie the quote in the note)


[1/17/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I will work on that this weekend when I write session notes from last night, as I'll want to push a new website then


[1/17/2023 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I like the double indent, yes


[1/17/2023 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
one small change - when reprocessing old metadata, I would probably set excursion = true for anything in location/locationRegion


[1/17/2023 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
That makes sense


[1/17/2023 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
And is easy enough


[1/17/2023 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed the location thing


[1/17/2023 7:50 PM] rsulfuratus
almost positive I have the github filter working for secret whereabouts. learned a lot about the limits of non-greedy regexes in the process


[1/18/2023 11:26 PM] rsulfuratus
seems like a whereabouts bug -- not sure why this doesn't an originally from line:

[1/18/2023 11:27 PM] rsulfuratus
difference is whether born is undefined


[1/18/2023 11:31 PM] rsulfuratus
(also when you set a born date, it updates 0001-01-01 but not 0001-01-02


[1/18/2023 11:35 PM] rsulfuratus
another minor thing - if the only whereabouts locations are excursions, the header should be "Currently..." instead of "Based..." (e.g. for people with no home base, such as many halflings)


[1/18/2023 11:37 PM] rsulfuratus
currently this gives you "(unknown location)"


[1/18/2023 11:41 PM] rsulfuratus
(think I fixed the last one)


[1/18/2023 11:43 PM] rsulfuratus
the undefined born bug I can't figure out though


[1/19/2023 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
do you know lua at all?


[1/19/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
not really


[1/19/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
I fixed the undefined born bug


[1/19/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
in javascript, new Date(1) means 1901


[1/19/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
😦


[1/19/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
you have to do
date.setFullYear(1)


[1/19/2023 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
there were also some weird timezone issues so I changed the date comparisions to just generate normalized strings (YYYYMMDD) and lexically compare them


[1/19/2023 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
awesome


[1/19/2023 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I was looking at a pandoc workflow to push obsidian md to gdrive  for e.g. party treasure, but ideally want to convert links to taelgarverse; there is a way to write pandoc filters using lua which should be able to do that


[1/19/2023 2:08 PM] rsulfuratus
also just pushed a commit that adds type to all notes in people - need to think about organizations a bit but just for now added type = Organization to families, dynasties/ruling houses, organizations, basically anything that refers to a collection of more than one person


[1/19/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a few bugs in the lastSeenByParty code:
1) this syntax doesn't seem to work, as far as I can tell: `metadata["lastSeenByParty_" + config.campaignPrefix];`
2) this `lastSeen = metadata.whereabouts.findLast(s => compare_dates(s.date,lastSeenByPartyDate) <= 0);` assumes the lastSeenByParty date will be js, not yaml, so you get a `TypeError: jsDate.getUTCFullYear is not a function` bug when you hit that code


[1/19/2023 6:56 PM] .deciusmus
fixed that


[1/19/2023 6:56 PM] .deciusmus
this does work: metadata["lastSeenByParty_" + config.campaignPrefix]


[1/19/2023 6:56 PM] .deciusmus
the bug was that my template passed the config data as configData rather than config so the config.campaignPrefix was always undefined


[1/19/2023 7:08 PM] rsulfuratus
great, works now


[1/19/2023 7:08 PM] rsulfuratus
after playing around with locations for a bit, a few comments:


[1/19/2023 7:09 PM] rsulfuratus
1) first, it really fun to have this info and runs the risk of spending too much time making up backstory for minor character as they travel around the world, but that's okay and part of the appeal


[1/19/2023 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
2) I think it would be useful to have a parameter to get_Whereabouts that turns off the checks for identity, and just displays all dates that exist, for a few NPCs where I want to see whether they are actually from where they live now


[1/19/2023 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
(that is, there is a difference between "I've decided Kaeso was born in Chardon" and "I don't know where Kaeso was born"


[1/19/2023 7:12 PM] rsulfuratus
currently that information cannot be seen in the header for two reasons: first because if home = origin then only home is displayed, and second because origin is just the first date you find, and home is the most recent non-excursion


[1/19/2023 7:13 PM] rsulfuratus
ideally origin should be where you are when you are born, and undefined otherwise,


[1/19/2023 7:14 PM] rsulfuratus
3) I think I would probably always have the last seen by party display, even if it matches home. I'm not going to bother setting the metadata unless I can about when/where the party last saw this person, so it is useful to display it if it exists no matter what


[1/19/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
Easy to change party. What about a get_AllWhereabouts that just outputs everything?


[1/19/2023 8:06 PM] .deciusmus
Add:

  "whereaboutsSettings": {
    "alwaysShowPartyLocation": true
  }


[1/19/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
to your taelgarConfig.json


[1/19/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
and pull


[1/19/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I am going to mess around for 20 minutes with making origin only set if the first date is the same as the born date, instead of just grabbing the first date after born to be the origin. in the situation where born is not set, origin implies 0001-01-01, anything else implies unknown origin

[1/19/2023 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the full location history could get long though for some people


[1/19/2023 8:35 PM] .deciusmus
I don't love having the location block have "unknown" origin for all the random folks for who it isn't set


[1/19/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
it shouldn't display unknown


[1/19/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not quite picturing what you are trying to do then


[1/19/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
Ah


[1/19/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
if origin == home, display both. if first date is not born date, that location is home, not origin


[1/19/2023 8:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I have the display both working the same way you did, with a config option in taelgar json


[1/19/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
the full location history is just  a separate template:

<% tp.user.locationHistory(tp) %>


[1/19/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
you can add it if you want


[1/19/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, nice. that is great


[1/19/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
```
 "whereaboutsSettings": {
    "alwaysShowPartyLocation": true,
    "alwaysShowOrigin" : true,
    "alwaysShowLocation": true
  }
```


[1/19/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
this should work with what I just pushed. there is still some off-by-one bug with born dates that have month/day (might just revert that, the only NPC I care about is Jumi for this)


[1/19/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
also still need to fix the situation where all days are excursions and not equal to birth date so no home and no origin, but the current setup doesn't display party seen location unless home exists, so trying to fix that too


[1/19/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus

[1/19/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
No fancy auto-replace of the block


[1/19/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
but you can just select it and re-run the location-history template


[1/19/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
that's fine, it is easy to delete and rerun


[1/19/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
might want to put that anywhere in a note


[1/19/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/19/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
or even inside a %%SECRET%% or %%Campaign%% block


[1/19/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
at the moment it doesn't stop with the current year, although it probably should


[1/19/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
that is, not show locations > the current fantasy cal date


[1/19/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
but honestly, not much point as it isn't dynamic


[1/19/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that doesn't seem necessary, can always manually delete future dates if needed


[1/19/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
right, but then pushing will get silly


[1/19/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, true


[1/19/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
its better to just add the %% blocks to strip from export if needed


[1/19/2023 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/19/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
you didn't push anything btw


[1/19/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
or if you did it wasn't to main


[1/19/2023 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
just pushed


[1/19/2023 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
was trying to fix a few remaining bugs first


[1/19/2023 8:52 PM] .deciusmus
I guess the idea of the change is the convention would be to use xxx-01-02 as the date for "unknown origin, here's home"


[1/19/2023 8:53 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly. which is what your frontmatter converter already does when home is set and origin is blank


[1/19/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
right ok


[1/19/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
so the main difference is that it will now show origin date for people even if the same as based


[1/19/2023 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
if "alwaysShowOrigin" : true is set in the config


[1/19/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
otherwise it will show origin only if different from based


[1/19/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/19/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
it would be nice to skip current location for dead people


[1/19/2023 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
and change Based in to Lived in


[1/19/2023 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I often set current location to deceased, place died, region died for dead people


[1/19/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
My use case at the moment is Sembaran royalty


[1/19/2023 8:58 PM] rsulfuratus
ah. right. my use case is people you have killed


[1/19/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
I have 15+ of them, and mostly don't care to set the locations, but there are a small number where I care that they came from somewhere


[1/19/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
right. People who died in an active campaign, the actual date of death rather than just year is nice


[1/19/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
but for example, I have Jane of Tollen. Who is notable for coming from Tollen


[1/19/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
It would be nice if I could just set originally from


[1/19/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
But honestly, maybe having a "historical:" tag or something that changes behavior would be better


[1/19/2023 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that should be easy when I get what I'm working on working


[1/19/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
Which is to say... I don't know if it actually makes sense to change current location for dead people, as your way is nice for true NPCs


[1/19/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I kind of like location being unaffected by alive/dead status


[1/19/2023 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
It might be better to have a historical: true yaml element (or a tag or HistoricalPerson) that just changes behavior a bit


[1/19/2023 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
for example, doesn't bother with whereabouts and just uses the old home/origin tags


[1/19/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, maybe it is a type: HistoricalNPC


[1/19/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
or type: HistoricalPerson


[1/19/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
historicalPerson as a type might be a good idea


[1/19/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
then supports whereabouts can be set false


[1/19/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
and it just falls back to the old home/homeregion stuff


[1/19/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
I've been messing around with Wikipedia style royalty boxes

ooh that is nice


[1/19/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
I like having predecessor and successor so I can click through and make sure I didn't overlap reigns or have someone have a child at 12 or 82


[1/19/2023 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
okay here is a javascript question for you - we have all these comparisons lastSeen.place == home.place  etc that assume a home place exists, but one doesn't have to if all locations are excursions


[1/19/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
I think you can do:

if (home == undefined) let home = {}


[1/19/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
then home.place will evaluate to undefined


[1/19/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
ah perfect


[1/19/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
which is not equal to lastSeen.place


[1/19/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
the config checking would be nicer to do that as well


[1/19/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. once the config is read from JSON do:

if (config.whereaboutsSettings == undefined) config.whereaboutsSettings = {}


[1/19/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
then you can just check the bools directly without the protection


[1/19/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
This is what I am aiming for for rulers:

[1/19/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
It would, I think, be generatable off:

* kingdoms: [...] (but usually just one)


[1/19/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
* reignStart/reignEnd with the ability to do reignStart_kingdom for complex cases


[1/19/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
predecessor and predecessor_kingdom
parents: []


[1/19/2023 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
anyway, signing off for now but will mess around more with rulers later. I'm going to try to get something working with a single kingdom first


[1/19/2023 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
although there are some cases in Sembaran history in particular where the crown passes between tyrwingha and sembara


[1/19/2023 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed update, based on preliminary testing should work as follows:


[1/19/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
If alwaysShow (origin, location, partyseen) is set, will always display Originally from: , Currently located, and Last seen as long as they are not undefined


[1/19/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
each can be set independently in taelgarConfig.json as above in chat, same as what you added for partySeen


[1/19/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
origin is defined as the location at birth


[1/19/2023 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
home is defined as the most recent non-excursion location, strictly after birth


[1/19/2023 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
current follows same rules, but doesn't ignore excursions


[1/19/2023 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so if only date is BORN-01-01, then will only display "Originally from: " and not "Based in: " or "Currently: " (but I might make currently still work in this scenario)


[1/19/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm going to play around over the weekend and see what we think; can tweak further if needed / desired


[1/19/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
generally convention is to set BORN-01-01 for origin, BORN-01-02 for home location; or just set BORN-01-02 for home location where origin is undetermined / unimportant


[1/19/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
requires a little bit of extra text if you want to display Based in: instead of Originally from: when home = origin as you need to set both 01-01 and 01-02 and have alwaysShowOrigin = false


[1/19/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, signing off now will fiddle more over the weekend


[1/20/2023 7:55 AM] .deciusmus
I was rethinking the whereabouts stuff a bit this morning. It is going to be very difficult to export it correctly at the moment because it depends on reading the obsidian vault data to determine if it should link the location or not, and python is not easily going to have access to that.

I was thinking maybe it would make sense to have only current location be live (and just not export that)


[1/20/2023 8:17 AM] rsulfuratus
I was rethinking a bit too just because it is going to be a pain to query origin / home with data view


[1/20/2023 8:24 AM] rsulfuratus
I don’t think the python is an issue though, you just have flags for the config elements


[1/20/2023 9:42 AM] .deciusmus
I meant the logic that auto-links if the region exists


[1/20/2023 9:42 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. does [[region]] vs region


[1/20/2023 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
python is going to have a hard time replicating that I think


[1/20/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
ah. yes, that will be difficult since my python script doesn't currently have access to a list of files in your vault


[1/20/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm. actually, it does.


[1/20/2023 9:44 AM] rsulfuratus
this might be pretty trivial


[1/20/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
for obsidianhtml need to export links in the form: [region](relative/path/to/region/file.md), not [[region]]


[1/20/2023 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
but I think this is only a few lines of code with the right modules. but will add dependencies to the python script you'll need to install


[1/20/2023 9:51 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah this is like 3 lines of code since I already have all the md files in your vault


[1/20/2023 9:52 AM] rsulfuratus
you'll need to install https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html

[1/20/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
Either way...

I don't actually know if there is much value in having the origin/home/party last seen stuff by dynamic


[1/20/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
origin, sure


[1/20/2023 9:54 AM] .deciusmus
For party last seen, exporting it as
%%Campaign:xxx%$
last seen by: 
%%%


[1/20/2023 9:54 AM] .deciusmus
probably makes more sense


[1/20/2023 9:54 AM] .deciusmus
the chance of both of us wanting to set it for different parties is actually pretty low


[1/20/2023 9:54 AM] .deciusmus
That leaves home. Which for something like what, 90% of people, doesn't change over the course of their fictional life


[1/20/2023 9:55 AM] .deciusmus
in which case again, who cares


[1/20/2023 9:55 AM] .deciusmus
It only really matters for people who moved homes between 1719 and 1748


[1/20/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, the issue is it is simpler to have home dynamic for everyone to handle the 5 edge cases, or is it easier to have a better way to handle edge cases?


[1/20/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
So I think there are two different questions


[1/20/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
The first one is whether we should have the whereabouts processing (outside of current location) move to the template generation


[1/20/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
So still driven by whereabouts, but baked into the MD file


[1/20/2023 10:02 AM] .deciusmus
conceptually, if you really had someone with different homes you could always export it to the YAML as:

%%^Date:1719-1740%%
Home: blah, blah
%%Date%%
%%^Date:1740%%
Home:blah,blah
%%

Your python script might need a minor update to allow a date end, i.e. string the date:1719-1740 unless the date is between those two values


[1/20/2023 10:03 AM] .deciusmus
That makes the obsidian note slightly less nice to read at the upside of making the export to html easier


[1/20/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
The other question is whether we should simplify origin / home outside of whereabouts


[1/20/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
The downside of that is that for home at least it is quite difficult to simplify


[1/20/2023 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
unless you lose the ability to have different homes...


[1/20/2023 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
Is the dv query to find the current home actually that hard?


[1/20/2023 10:06 AM] rsulfuratus
the tricky bit is the logic to determine if the first date in the whereabouts is origin or home, since based on the current setup that requires that you compare to born and correct for missing born information


[1/20/2023 10:07 AM] rsulfuratus
I was wondering about just manually specifying, e.g:
```
whereabouts:
     - { date: 1734-01-01, place: "Ko'zula village", region: The Central Highlands, type: origin}
     - { date: 1734-01-02, place: "Ko'zula village", region: The Central Highlands, type: home}
     - { date: 1748-01-02, place: "Forest of Nightmares", region: The Central Highlands, type: excursion}
```


[1/20/2023 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/20/2023 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus
could have a script that fills in type based on the current logic


[1/20/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
that's a good idea


[1/20/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
you could then make date optional


[1/20/2023 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[1/20/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
So what about the following set of changes


[1/20/2023 10:15 AM] .deciusmus
1. Whereabouts Spec Change:

* Use type: of origin, home, excursion and date is optional
* "origin" is calculated as first whereabouts with type origin (expected to be single one))
* "home" is calculated as:
*** If there is a single value with home, it is home, and the date is ignored/optional
*** If there are multiple values with home, the most recent whereabouts with type home where the date is before or equal to the current campaign date. 
* "current" is calculated as it is today
* "last party seen" is calculated as it is today


[1/20/2023 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that would work


[1/20/2023 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus
allows for most people just setting origin if desired and home, without needing dates


[1/20/2023 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/20/2023 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
2. Whereabouts Header Generation Change

* The generate header Javascript is modified to bake the origin into the header markdown, rather than using a dataview
* The generate header Javascript is modified to bake the party last seen location into the markdown, under a %% Campaign %% export filter, on the assumption that each campaign will have a distinct set of "important" NPCs where the last seen by party date is worth setting.
*** If any NPCs come up where we want to manage for two campaigns, discuss a solution then.


[1/20/2023 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
3. The existing get_Whereabouts is modified to be a get_CurrentWhereabouts and it just returns the current location. The python export can (for now) just strip this.


[1/20/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
That leaves home. Two options:

Option 1: Bake in.
The generate header Javascript is modified to create a Based in: line for EACH home region, protected under a %%Date%% export filter (which would need to be modified to include an end date).
Pros: Keeps export working fine without more work; prevents a lot of flux as the export and Javascript diverge. 
Cons: Actual note in obsidian slightly messy for complex characters with multiple home regions. Also not live with whereabouts changes.

Option 2: Keep dynamic.
Create a get_HomeRegion DataView function which exports the home for the current campaign date or "" if no home. The header includes this in the right spot and it gets reimplmeneted in python.
Pros: Neater obsidian note. Live with whereabouts changes.
Cons: More work to get the export working.

Option 3: Both.
If there is a single home region, the Javascript bakes it into the generated markdown. If there are multiples, it inserts a get_HomeRegion DV.
Pros: Neater markdown in Obsidian. Simple characters with a single home region have working export immediately.
Cons: Still need to create a get_HomeRegion to support characters with complex histores.


[1/20/2023 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
Thoughts?


[1/20/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
generally speaking the annoying part about the python export functions is not replicating the core date extraction code, but all the ancillary formatting, which easily diverges


[1/20/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
I might think a bit this weekend about a better way to do this, perhaps using a json config file that both dataview and python can read, which would make the python functions way simpler to implement and would make option 2 a lot more straightforward


[1/20/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess the other issue here is that we need to agree on whether origin is always displayed or not, if origin == home


[1/20/2023 10:32 AM] .deciusmus
I'm happy to always display origin


[1/20/2023 10:32 AM] .deciusmus
and party last seen


[1/20/2023 10:32 AM] .deciusmus
I just don't like displaying current location unless it is different than home


[1/20/2023 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/20/2023 10:32 AM] .deciusmus
I would also like my export to never show current location, which is one advantage of breaking it up


[1/20/2023 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/20/2023 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
me too


[1/20/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
One option would be to have something like:

get_CurrentFantasyDate
get_CurrentWhereabouts


[1/20/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
then the template could insert:

>> Current location (on $=dv.view("get_CurrentFantasyDate"):  $=dv.view("get_CurrentWhereabouts")


[1/20/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
and the ancillary formatting wouldn't need to change


[1/20/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
or I guess


[1/20/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
for current location that is not needed


[1/20/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
nevermind


[1/20/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
for current location it is better to have it all in a view


[1/20/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
ignore me


[1/20/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
and in fact, because of blank home strings, you can't really make it simpler


[1/20/2023 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe I should make a github issue for this so we can track what we agreed 🙂


[1/20/2023 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
But I think at the very least:
* Change origin to use type: origin and change the origin line to be generated by the template
* Change the calculation of home to use type: home
* Change the calculation of excursion to use type: excursion


[1/20/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the header should be:
>> Originally from: place, region
`$=dv.view("get_HomeRegion")`
`$=dv.view("get_CurrentWhereabouts")`
%%^Campaign:xxxx%%
>> Last seen by <PARTY NAME> at <DATE>: 
%%^End%%

{Reactions}
👍

[1/20/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
where originally from only prints if origin is defined, and the last three lines only print if lastSeenByParty_XXXX is defined


[1/20/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
I would remove the fallback to a generic lastSeenBy metadata, last seen must define by who or it isn't displayed


[1/20/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
I would then implement get_HomeRegion in python, but not get_CurrentWhereabouts, which we assume is never exported


[1/20/2023 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I was going to have:

lastSeenByParty:
lastSeenByPartyName:


[1/20/2023 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
I don't like that because I have multiple campaigns


[1/20/2023 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus
there are a surprising number of people who cross between great library and dunmar, for example, and also between mawar and dunmar, and mawar and great library


[1/20/2023 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus
not all of them need last seen by, but better to be flexible now


[1/20/2023 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
do you want to export each one separately


[1/20/2023 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
i.e have:

%%^Campaign:c1%%
>> Last seen by <PARTY NAME> at <DATE>: 
%%^End%%
%%^Campaign:c2%%
>> Last seen by <PARTY NAME> at <DATE>: 
%%^End%%
%%^Campaign:c3%%
>> Last seen by <PARTY NAME> at <DATE>: 
%%^End%%


[1/20/2023 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is what I would imagine for obsidian, although I should probably change the python code so that it can handle single-line, e.g. %%^Campaign:c1%% >> Last seen by <PARTY NAME> at <DATE>:  %%^End%%


[1/20/2023 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
in that case the campaign prefix stuff isn't helpful


[1/20/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
we need something like:

lastSeenByParty:
- {date: x, campaign: y}


[1/20/2023 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
ah. yeah, that works


[1/20/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
ideally we'd add something to metadata.json to define campaigns


[1/20/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. 

{ campaigns: { name: Cleeenseau, partyName: Blah Blah Blah, prefix: clee }}


[1/20/2023 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would be great


[1/20/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
then your last seen by could be:
- {date: xyz, campaignId: DuFr }


[1/20/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
and it would look up the party name from the json and generate the insertion

{Reactions}
👍

[1/20/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I'm still not convinced there is any benefit to having the home region stuff by dynamic if there is only a single home region


[1/20/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
Mostly because I don't want to write python code but I do want to get a new web export soon 🙂


[1/20/2023 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
Well, it is easy enough to go with option 3 if you prefer. I just don't like option 1. 

I am planning on working on python stuff this weekend, to:
1) clean up the export code to generate a new website to go with session notes from last session, and 
2) come up with a way, using python filters and pandoc, to push specific md pages to google drive as docx files, and sync changes back to the obsidian md file (to allow for things like party treasure, and editing session notes). this code will also replace links with links to the website


[1/20/2023 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
I might end up with option 3


[1/20/2023 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
I agree that I don't love option 1


[1/20/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
unfortunately this line:
%%^Campaign:xxxx%%

Generates an empty newline in the callout

what if you do:

all as one line? that should be fine right?


[1/20/2023 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I just need to modify my code so it doesn't assume the flag is on a line by itself


[1/20/2023 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
(but I will probably still assume that the callout begins at the start of a line and ends at the end of a line)

[1/20/2023 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
much nicer


[1/20/2023 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
that's this:

```
>> %%Campaign:clee%% Last seen by PARTY NAME at February 3rd, 1701: Whitsun District, [[Chardon]], [[Chardonian Empire]] %%End%%
>> %%Campaign:DuFr%% Last seen by PARTY NAME at February 3rd, 1719: [[Amberglow]], [[Feywild]] %%End%%
```


[1/20/2023 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
I will change my python code so you can do:
`%%^Campaign:xxxx%% Location text %%^End%%`
or:
```
%%^Campaign:xxxx%% Location text 
more text
%%^End%%
```
or:
```
%%^Campaign:xxxx%% 
Paragraph of text
%%^End%%
```
But not:
```
Text %%^Campaign:xxx%% campaign text %%^End%% 
```


[1/20/2023 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I think generally you either want the first (for headers or other single-line stuff) or the third (for campaign-specific paragraphs)


[1/20/2023 12:33 PM] .deciusmus
right although I have Text Campaign


[1/20/2023 12:33 PM] .deciusmus
as the callout start is "text"


[1/20/2023 12:33 PM] .deciusmus
```%%Campaign:clee%%>> Last seen by PARTY NAME at February 3rd, 1701: Whitsun District, [[Chardon]], [[Chardonian Empire]] %%End%%```

ah. hmm. okay, let me fiddle with that


[1/20/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
just a bit more annoying because I have to regex the line instead of just using line.startswith() and line.endswith()


[1/20/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
but don't think it is too bad


[1/20/2023 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
it renders as

you can just trim leading >

[1/20/2023 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[1/20/2023 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
I won't have anything in "text" other than an arbitrary number of >


[1/20/2023 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
depending on how deep the callout is


[1/20/2023 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
that is fine then


[1/20/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus

[1/20/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
alternatively could have a newline after home if exists, and there would just be whitespace after the permanent location block and the moveable location block


[1/20/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
so you'd either have: originally, home, newline, location


[1/20/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
or: originally, newline, location


[1/20/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but I'm fine either way


[1/20/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess the first option might look weird if there is no home or origin, since you'd have a double-indent newline to start the location section


[1/20/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/20/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
actually


[1/20/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
nevermind, it is an artifact of testing


[1/20/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
my generateHeader block won't even insert the dv.view unless you have 2+ home regions


[1/20/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
so it will only come up when you have 2+ home regions and then you change them live


[1/20/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
is this the right rule for current:
let current = metadata.whereabouts.findLast(s => compare_dates(s.date, currentJsDate) <= 0 && s.type != "origin");


[1/20/2023 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yes

[1/20/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
gotta go back to work now


[1/20/2023 1:18 PM] .deciusmus
but in my limited testing it seems to work


[1/20/2023 1:22 PM] .deciusmus
Here's what I'm about to push, let me know if you want me to hold off:

* An update to the update-frontermatter template so that if there is no whereabouts, it converts from home/homeRegion/location/locatonRegion using the new approach
* An update to the main generate header template so that if any of the whereabouts in the file have a type set, it uses the new logic we've been discussing. otherwise it injects the old get_Whereabouts.
* New scripts for get_CurrentWhereabots and get_HomeWhereabouts that should be pretty easy to port to python for export (and the get_current) probably just needs to return ""


[1/20/2023 1:23 PM] .deciusmus
Still would be nice to have auto-convesion of whereabouts to new format, but haven't written that yet


[1/20/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
👍


[1/20/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
sounds great


[1/20/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
pushed


[1/21/2023 8:28 AM] rsulfuratus
push *UNTESTED* version of python code to handle home values and conversion of strings to links. going to be busy through midafternoon but will hopefully be able to test/debug later today. however should work fine for note without a home dview function


[1/21/2023 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
python export should be working now


[1/21/2023 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
may fail if you have multiple homes w/o dates, also needs testing on windows for path operations


[1/21/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
I'll try it out later tonight or tomorrow


[1/22/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
is this expected:
C:\Users\msackton\personal\OneDrive\taelgar>python _scripts\convert_markdown.py --date 1719 --campaign Clee --dir  C:\Users\msackton\personal\OneDrive\taelgar\_publishSupport\output\md
In file C:\Users\msackton\personal\OneDrive\taelgar\_publishSupport\output\md\People\Chardonians\Albus.md, couldn't parse filter at line: %%^Date:1748-08-05%%


[1/22/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
ah. yes, the filter assumes just a single YYYY for date. that is easy to change. running for Isaac now but will push a change later this afternoon


[1/22/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
Also, is your publish workflow basically:

1. run obsidianhtml convert with compile_html false
2. run convert_markdown
3. run obsidianhtml with compile_md false

?


[1/22/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/22/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
the convert markdown replaces files in place


[1/22/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
I had to make one bugfix to how it reads/writes files


[1/22/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
to explicitly pass in UTF-8 rather than assuming


[1/22/2023 3:04 PM] rsulfuratus
you should be able to fix the date thing by changing this line: 
`re.search(r'^(.*?)%%\^([A-Za-z]+):\s*(\w+)\s*%%', line)`
to:
`re.search(r'^(.*?)%%\^([A-Za-z]+):\s*(w+).*?\s*%%', line)`


[1/22/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
need to test to make sure it doesn't break anything else


[1/22/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
I might not muck around with regex


[1/22/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
but I did fix it to read the current fantasy calendar data


[1/22/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
although you can still pass in a date


[1/22/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
if you want


[1/22/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
--configDir C:\Users\msackton\personal\OneDrive\taelgar\.obsidian


[1/22/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
will cause it to read the json file that fantasy calendar uses


[1/22/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
for the date


[1/22/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
date is now optional


[1/22/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
it errors if you don't specfiy one or the other


[1/22/2023 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
I also fixed it to not error on get_CurrentWhereabouts


[1/22/2023 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
as that is expected to return ""


[1/22/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
on the date stuff, if I pass in 1719-10-21 it gets confused for the current year calculations.


[1/22/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
so just fixing the regex isn't enough


[1/22/2023 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
right, need to either strip the month/day from the input date and fix the regex or capture full date in both and compare. will fix it later


[1/22/2023 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
input_date.split("-")]0] should work to use year/year comparisons only


[1/22/2023 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
can you push changes you made to export script?


[1/22/2023 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed changes to markdown export that should allow YYYY-MM-DD dates in both the input date and the %%^Date:%% lines. The month and day are ignored, though, so if you have a %%^Date:1750-05-01%% filter and pass 1750-01-01 as a date, it will still print. if this seems like a useful use case, it is possible to change this


[1/22/2023 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
also note that the filters for the python script need to start %%^ not just %%, I added the ^ to avoid the (unlikely) edge case where there is a %%Date (some comment text) %% edge case


[1/22/2023 4:49 PM] rsulfuratus
so I changed the header template to output %%^Campaign:%% and %%^End%% as expected by the python script


[1/22/2023 5:09 PM] rsulfuratus
On a separate topic, I've been playing around with timelines. The obsidian timeline plugin is kind of unsatisfying - it requires that you encode events to display as <span></span> or <div></div> elements, which breaks a lot of stuff (e.g., you can't have links in them) and is also a pain to generate.


[1/22/2023 5:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a python script that takes a csv file and can generate one note for each row in various ways; this allows me to make an event for each day using fantasy calendar very easily, but then it is not really easy to do much with them


[1/22/2023 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
I am kind of wondering if a templater template is the best option - the basic idea would be that if you want to insert a timeline/chronology segment into a note, you'd have a template that would figure it out and generate static markdown. in theory given that there would be fc-date: 1747-04-05 or whatever in the metadata it shouldn't be too difficult to find the right notes with dataview, but not sure how easy it is to work with dataview in templater, e.g. get a list of notes matching some criteria and then do some text processing on them


[1/22/2023 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
there are basically three use cases:
1) inserting timeline/chronology segments into session notes, which would depend on finding all notes with fantasy dates between a start and end range, and then extracting the correct text (e.g., everything under a ## campaignname header), reformating, and inserting


[1/22/2023 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
2) doing the same, but for NPC chronology sections, where start and end might be irrelevant but you want something like every line that mentioned NPC name


[1/22/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
3) would be just making a static chronology/timeline page for a specific campaign, just nicer than the kind of ugly formatting that obsidian timeline uses by default. this wouldn't be frequently regenerated


[1/22/2023 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
the other option is just keeping the official timeline as csv and having a python script that regenerates notes as needed, whenever the timeline is updated...


[1/22/2023 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway curious about your thoughts


[1/22/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
For events that are happening during a game/in the timeframe of a game, I think the fantasy calendar tagging system (with fc-date and fc-end) and small articles for each "event" makes a lot of sense


[1/22/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
From there, I'm not sure how much it is worth figuring out how to insert them into some other note


[1/22/2023 7:32 PM] .deciusmus
I guess from my perspective, where I am starting a new campaign, my plan would be to just integrate the events into my session note as I write it


[1/22/2023 7:34 PM] .deciusmus
So for example "Celyn and Najeer Garay play dice for a bit in the evening, and hear some rumors about the tragic flood. "


[1/22/2023 7:34 PM] .deciusmus
where tragic flood is linked to an event note


[1/22/2023 7:35 PM] .deciusmus
I can see them all nicely on the fantasy calendar in obsidian, and I don't see a huge need to publish a calendar online as the goal is more for me to keep track


[1/22/2023 7:35 PM] .deciusmus
(and I can make articles for things I know are going to happen as part of session prep and have them available during the game at certain future dates)


[1/22/2023 7:36 PM] .deciusmus
The other place I would want timelines is for "grand sweep of history" stuff, which is where I was hoping to use the timeline plugin, but where it wasn't great


[1/22/2023 7:37 PM] .deciusmus
But the Fantasy Calendar stuff isn't great for that because I don't want to have to make up an exact date, i.e. you might have an event that took place in the 1420s without needing to be more exact


[1/22/2023 7:42 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I'm not sure it is worth doing anything complicated. I guess you are talking about stuff like this https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Session%20Notes/Session%2051-52%20(DuFr).html


[1/22/2023 7:42 PM] .deciusmus
hrm


[1/22/2023 7:47 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah that sort of thing. I actually was looking a bit and I think a python script to write static markdown is probably the easiest. It is annoying because you would need to run it outside obsidian but for moving text from one note to another, for example, it is tough to beat just simple text processing via external programs


[1/22/2023 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
But this isn’t really the sort of thing that would be dynamic - I would use fantasy calendar for that. So I would just update when I export session notes or something


[1/22/2023 8:12 PM] .deciusmus
I guess my main thought would be to keep it a bit external to the obsidian worfklow


[1/22/2023 8:12 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. I don't think I'd use your python script at all


[1/22/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if I was adding a section to say, Vistra Fireforge about an event from the Ausson's Crossing mini-series, I would just write the text in her note and link to the event page


[1/22/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
So if you had your "source of truth" in an external file that would be a bit annoying as you'd overwrite when you ran it again


[1/22/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
I will say having an event type is probably a good idea:

type: event
fc-date:
fc-end:
peoplePresent: []
location: 
campaign:


[1/22/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
or something like that


[1/22/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
although I'm not sure you even need the campaign


[1/22/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure how often I'd bother to set say the peoplePresent


[1/22/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
which would mostly be useful if you wanted to generate a dataview-based chronology of a person


[1/24/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
spent a bit of time on my timeline/date system last night and this morning

the basic system I am coming towards is made up of three parts. the fundamental unit is a daily note, which has type: Daily Note and taelgar-date: YYYY-MM-DD in the metadata, and then one or more events, where each event is indicated by this format:
```
## header
{ secret: (true/false), campaign: [ ], title: (optional), people [ ] }

Text goes here

---
```


[1/24/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
I have a script to convert csv timelines with date as the first column into these daily notes, which will also append events if the daily note already exists


[1/24/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
this can allow quick additions to the daily notes, e.g. if I have the timeline of some NPC in onenote or something I can copy it to a csv and just append it to the correct daily notes


[1/24/2023 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
this part is done


[1/24/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
the second piece is a script to insert pure markdown timelines into notes. at a minimum I think I would need two classes of timelines. one takes all events from date x to date y, optionally filtered for campaign/secrets, formats and inserts them as a timeline (e.g. for session notes or for a 'master timeline' of all Taelgar events). the other takes all events tagged with people == X and/or all events that mention person X and inserts them into a note, for things like NPC chronology. since this would use a regex to find events that mention X, could also be used to create timelines for places (who was where when) or things like that, which can occasionally be helpful (e.g. when PCs are at Place X asking about NPCs of type Y, e.g. in Tokra asking "have any Chardonians been around?")


[1/24/2023 9:51 AM] rsulfuratus
although it would be great to have this as a templater function, realistically I think I will probably write this in python since I'm not sure I want to tackle complicated string parsing and regexes in javascript. but in theory this could be ported to javascript if desired, so it could be run as a templater template. the other option would be to use the templater option to create user functions linked to system commands, which would mean it would conceivably be possible to create a user function that did something like 'python insert_template.py'


[1/24/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the third piece is a script to generate fantasy calendar events from the daily notes, and potentially vice versa. creating events would probably be based off making notes with the proper yaml, but reading fc events to insert into daily notes would probably be done by reading the json. the main idea here is that I don't necessarily want a separate event for every daily note, but it is nice to see certain things on the calendar. i'm still thinking about this a bit.


[1/24/2023 11:44 AM] .deciusmus
That sounds very optimized for a different use case that mine


[1/24/2023 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
Which is fine


[1/24/2023 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
I just doubt I’d use any of it


[1/24/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
right, none of this is stuff I would anticipate you being interested in. the main question is making sure I don't overwrite your system


[1/24/2023 11:46 AM] .deciusmus
So I guess the question would be: for what type of notes would you run your second script


[1/24/2023 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus
definitely session notes and for a master timeline (by year or month/year) in my DM notes and possibly for export; almost definitely also for NPCs, maybe for places


[1/24/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
If I understand your system you basically have a daily note for each taelgar day where something interesting happened


[1/24/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
Which would have headers for each event


[1/24/2023 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
So one day might have several events— party heals hrothgar, Grash leaves Kherson, etc


[1/24/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/24/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
this is just replicating my current nasty onenote table in a better more flexible format


[1/24/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
The you want to be able to back-fill that into an NPC or place note


[1/24/2023 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/24/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
So the Kherson note would have a timeline of all the events that from the daily notes that happened in Kherson


[1/24/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
Or NPC X would have a timeline of all the events that happened to them


[1/24/2023 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, conceivably.


[1/24/2023 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure where exactly I would use this - in my old onenote system is was impossible to do anything dynamically so I just had a big table and would reference it as needed. could end up just doing the same thing, using obsidian search or backlinks just to find all the daily notes where XX person or place is linked


[1/24/2023 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
or mentioned via search


[1/24/2023 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
but trying to design the system at the start so it can potentially interface with fantasy calendar events and also with inserting templates


[1/24/2023 11:56 AM] .deciusmus
Right...


[1/24/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
and also not break stuff that you add to notes, e.g. if there is a chronology section for Crossroads Inn and you have a bunch of stuff there and I want to add "Marcella arrives after crossing the ~CentralMountains~"


[1/24/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/24/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
I need to not erase anything you already have


[1/24/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
That was my main thought


[1/24/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
for shared NPCs and Places, I would (probably) mostly just manually write notes to start


[1/24/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
That said, I'm not sure if I actually want to do that as it doesn't scale super well


[1/24/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
I am very much leaning toward a system where I create a page for each event


[1/24/2023 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
I can easily tag those with taelgar-date though


[1/24/2023 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
Is there a reason not to have a page per event


[1/24/2023 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
?


[1/24/2023 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
My noodling around was more like, what if each event had:
* date
* location
* people

in the frontmatter


[1/24/2023 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
my issue is that my current notes are hugely varying in usefulness, e.g. I have some days where I just have "party continued sailing across the Nevos Sea towards Chardon" and it gets really cluttered to have an event for every single day


[1/24/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
and then you could fairly trivially generate a dataview


[1/24/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
I don't mean a calendar event


[1/24/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
I mean an obsidian page for each event


[1/24/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
I thought you were planning on having a page-per-day


[1/24/2023 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I have a page per day. but then I am going to separately create events from specific subsets


[1/24/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
still thinking about this a bit


[1/24/2023 12:02 PM] .deciusmus
What is the advantage in page-per-day rather than page-for-each header within the page per day


[1/24/2023 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. rather than having:

--
type: event
taelgar-date: 1719-10-21
---

## Party Arrives in Cleenseau
stuff

## Attack on Taviose
stuff


[1/24/2023 12:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a short meeting now will resume in 20 minutes


[1/24/2023 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
have:
File 1:
--
type: event
taelgar-date: 1719-10-21
---

## Party Arrives in Cleenseau
stuff

File2:
--
type: event
taelgar-date: 1719-10-21
---

## Attack on Taviose
stuff


[1/24/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly just because it makes it harder to move things around between "headers"


[1/24/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
okay so back to this while I eat lunch - I tried making separate notes for each header, but it got really cluttered and it is harder to reorganize and I didn't really like it. 

but I think the best solution ultimately is to have both notes with type = Daily Note and notes with type = Event. both notes require a taelgar-date: YYYY-MM-DD. a Daily Note note is parsed assuming each h2 block is a separate event, an Event note is parsed assuming the entire text of the note is the event


[1/24/2023 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
so my text insertion code would parse all Event and Daily Note notes, getting metadata from the json string following the h2 header for Daily Notes and the yaml frontmatter for Events


[1/24/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
then the only complication is how to sync things up


[1/24/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
probably the simplest thing is to have the template code detect existing events and only insert new ones, optionally generating an event note or a csv (to import to daily notes) for anything new that it doesn't know about


[1/24/2023 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
this would mean we don't need to share our events directories (which can get a little annoying, especially because comments don't render in the note preview, which means that %%SECRET secret stuff %% doesn't show up in the preview of a fc event on the calendar)


[1/24/2023 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is possible to do this as a user function that runs "python _scripts/python/generate_timeline.py --file <% tp.file.path() %>" or something like that


[1/24/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
probably would also need to pass the vault directory or something but should presumably be able to get that from tp.obsidian


[1/24/2023 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
The reason I was asking is that for a lot  of shared purposes, a type = event probably works better


[1/24/2023 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
I would rather than a template or dataview query that inserts a timeline from the yaml frontmatter than a python script, to be honest


[1/24/2023 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I mean conceivably this could all be done with templates


[1/24/2023 1:16 PM] .deciusmus
I gotta run to a meeting but more in a it


[1/24/2023 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
the limitations of templater or dataview are, imo: 
1) I don't want to have to backfill tags for every event I already have; using a regex to search for a specific string in all events generally the behavior I would want when generating a timeline. while I sure this is technically possible with javascript/templater it would be a lot faster for me to write it in python
2) I want to be able preserve existing text that doesn't match any known events in a chronology section, and ideally to modify the datastore (either by creating events or by creating a csv file to read into daily notes or both) to add those unknown events to a central place. this is also probably technically possible in javascript/templater but a lot more complicated
3) I am tempted to use this to play around with the python openai api, to do things like generate a short summary of any text longer than 25-50 words for the chronology section, with a link back to a (potentially autogenerated) event for the rest of the text.


[1/24/2023 1:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but honestly this can all theoretically live alongside a separate templater function that does nothing but query yaml frontmatter and insert formatted markdown - as long as the templater function is capable of detecting existing text and leaving it alone


[1/24/2023 1:32 PM] rsulfuratus
(and ideally checking for duplicate text and only printing events that are not already in the chronology)


[1/24/2023 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
so we can in theory have totally different ways of handling events as long as we both: a) generate raw markdown in the same format/style, and b) preserve existing text in chronology sections unchanged while avoiding adding duplicate lines


[1/24/2023 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
actually the openAI python library looks extremely powerful. e.g.: https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-tldr-summary

{Embed}
https://beta.openai.com/examples/default-tldr-summary
OpenAI API
An API for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI


[1/24/2023 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I could just add a 25 word summary to every note that is > 250 words or something like that


[1/24/2023 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and use it to auto-create 5 word titles for fantasy calendar events


[1/24/2023 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I think (b) preserving existing text starts to get pretty complicated


[1/24/2023 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
if you call the open AI library, for example, how do you know what the "existing text" is


[1/24/2023 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
It would be possible to tag each section in the chronology with the source note but it all starts to feel very complicated


[1/24/2023 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
Here is what I am imagining the script would do:


[1/24/2023 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
1) read vault and make a dict of all events from daily notes and event notes


[1/24/2023 2:20 PM] rsulfuratus
2) read the file and find the chronology section to replace


[1/24/2023 2:20 PM] rsulfuratus
3) parse the chronology section into a date/string dict


[1/24/2023 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
4) filter the vault dict into date/string


[1/24/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
Not to interrupt... but I guess I'm mostly having a hard time figuring out where -- outside of session notes and a campaign timeline -- you'd actually want a chronology section that wasn't "hand written"


[1/24/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
What does the chronology section for, say, Ausson's Crossing look like?


[1/24/2023 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
It feels a bit weird to have "1748: Marcella arrives" all by itself, like that is somehow a meaningful event


[1/24/2023 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
Why would anyone care?


[1/24/2023 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
I can see wanted to see what NPCs are around a place, but you know that from whereabouts


[1/24/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
Places I am not sure about usefulness


[1/24/2023 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
and I can see wanting to have a chronology of a place but I feel like if I was ever doing that I'd make it up, and what I'd really want to is find the backlinks to the place and then manually decide if I wanted to insert the event


[1/24/2023 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah, it may be this is the easiest way and the number of NPCs / places I want chronologies for is small enough that back links are best


[1/24/2023 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not going to write this templating code imminently


[1/24/2023 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
But I do want to get all my campaign timelines and events into obsidian asap so I am trying to think through what I might do with them later to inform that process


[1/24/2023 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
But honestly given that you are not likely to use my daily note structure none of this likely matters for not


[1/24/2023 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
*now


[1/24/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
part of the reason I was thinking metadata would be nice would be because I would be tempted to have a dataview that just shows all of the events that happened to a certain NPC


[1/24/2023 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
to make a quick timline


[1/24/2023 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
for an NPC that shows up a lot the backlinks could get a little drowned out by the session note backlinks


[1/24/2023 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
For example, in my Cleenseau campaign, Rosalind the heir-apparent to the manor is a pretty key NPC


[1/24/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
in say 6 sessions, I could see it becoming useful to make up her life story a little more completely, or for me to just want to see an overview of her interactions with the party


[1/24/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
But I think I'd want to do that with a dataview block on her page which would explicitly not get exported, as a way for me to see what has happened


[1/24/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
and than I'd decide how the info in that dataview block influences the life story I end up writing for her


[1/24/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
So to assisst that, I am likely to try really hard to make small notes for each event in her life (if I don't just add it directly to her page, which is the other possibility)


[1/24/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if in game I describe how she came to meet her husband, I'd be tempted to write it up as a The Meeting of Rosalind and Arthur note standalone


[1/24/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
I see why you wouldn't want to do that, but I think that one of the challenges is that I don't necessarily want to lock in a chronology section as being 100% generated from notes


[1/24/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
Right that is the logic behind preserving existing text in the chronology section


[1/24/2023 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
I think the concern would be that it really locks in the format and structure


[1/24/2023 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe it doesn't?


[1/24/2023 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
Ah. If you want something more Freeform, yeah I guess that would be an issue


[1/24/2023 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
I think my concern is that if I was just making up a history of something it would be more natural to just write it


[1/24/2023 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
### Chronology of Events

* [[Founding of Ausson's Crossing|Ausson's Crossing]] was founded in 1642 by someone and someone
* In 1658, the [[Plague of BlahBlah]] ravanged the borderlands, and Ausson's Crossing was instramental in


[1/24/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Again, realistically, I'm not sure this is a concern


[1/24/2023 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I was thinking the chronology section would be modeled on the timeline plug-in in the sense it auto populates from defined other notes


[1/24/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Your daily note structure is really intended to cover session notes and campaign timelines more than anything else, I assume


[1/24/2023 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes


[1/24/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
For a session note header, I think I'd want to do it that one


[1/24/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
Same for a campaign timline, because in both cases I'm not really making up something whole cloth


[1/24/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
I'm coming up with a way to visualize the scraps of information I've made up in game


[1/24/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
or in session prep


[1/24/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
or whatever


[1/24/2023 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
But if I was doing session prep and decided I wanted to make up the history of Cleenseau for the past two generations, because it was going to be relevant to the next session, I'd really prefer to just write it down in the note


[1/24/2023 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think this is all irrelevant


[1/24/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
in that, if we broadly agree that we should use taelgar-date for events


[1/24/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
and we should have a type of event or dailyNote


[1/24/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
we can see where it goes


[1/24/2023 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I was about to type something similar but more complicate


[1/24/2023 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the following should be true:
1) All notes with type = Event define something that happened at a specific time in Taelgar. 
2) all events have a taelgar-date and optionally a taelgar-end-date that indicates when they happened
3) any code that works with taelgar-date metadata should accept dates in YYYY, YYYY-MM, or YYYY-MM-DD format
4) if subtypes are required (e.g., for my daily notes or if we want a "year note" or "decade note" for historical purposes), they should be defined by subtype: XXXX and keep type: Event; code that depends on specific formats should check subtype


[1/24/2023 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
and I guess the probably-obvious corrallary that we should make sure we are using consistent metadata as needed, e.g. if we want metadata to store people associated with an event, or campaigns, or whatever we should agree on the format


[1/24/2023 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
(and 3 doesn't necessarily mean the code has to work on plain years, just it shouldn't throw an error if it gets YYYY)


[1/24/2023 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
that makes sense


[1/24/2023 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
We should also think about what it means to link to an event note


[1/24/2023 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
because I think that implies the note is shared


[1/24/2023 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
which gets a bit interesting


[1/24/2023 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
[ and is one big advantage of data-view]


[1/24/2023 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I think probably we should try to only link to events with subtype Historical or something like that


[1/24/2023 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. most / all of what is currently in History / Historical Events


[1/24/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is something I would just see how it works out though.


[1/24/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not sure about that… doesn’t that make npcs a bit sparse, ie you can’t link to anything from their pages


[1/24/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
right, for your workflow where you mostly have specific events it would be a challenge


[1/24/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I at least for now don't have a lot / any actual Event notes


[1/24/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus

it already shows up in my vault with a handful of broken links to events


[1/24/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/24/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
I have the same issue with npcs and items


[1/24/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so conceivably it could make sense to just share items and events


[1/24/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
you have a broken %%SECRET tag in Alesh btw


[1/24/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
I am averting my eyes


[1/24/2023 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
ah it isn't closed at the end of the file


[1/24/2023 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
An example is Camana


[1/24/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think it matters, I was just working out where she would be in case you were not trying to avoid people when crossing to the tower last session

[1/24/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right, some of that is just from old notes that I haven't revised yet. e.g. I would change that to "In June 1748, Agata's hut was looted, but not destroyed, by PARTY NAME"


[1/24/2023 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it matters a ton but it might be good to define what the expected end state is


[1/24/2023 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
for example, it might be worth having a shared Current Events folder


[1/24/2023 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
and if you happen to notice a broken link like the one above I can move the event file to the Current Events\1719 folder


[1/24/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I guess I just wonder about the downside to sharing all events and all items


[1/24/2023 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
items mostly if it annoys you to manage secret


[1/24/2023 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
and name collisions


[1/24/2023 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
but I guess if you are publishing items, secret data needs to be %% anyway so does it really matter?


[1/24/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
items all are done using %%SECRET %% anyway, since I need to comment out stuff for the web


[1/24/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
honestly I think it simplifies things, basically I have a DM folder that is my session prep and other stuff, and no notes outside the DM folder ever link into DM folder notes. I have the campaign folder which is basically session notes and other campaign-specific player facing things, but I am also aiming to have nothing from outside the campaign folder link into campaign folder notes. then everything else


[1/24/2023 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
linking to session notes is actually rarely, if ever, useful, since I typically do that because I want to know when something happened, and it would be better to have a dated event that both session notes and the place/NPC/item page could link to


[1/24/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/24/2023 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
so I would propose that items and events get promoted to top-level folders that are entirely shared


[1/24/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
maybe Curernt Events instead of Events?


[1/24/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
I still think we might want to do something very different for historical events


[1/24/2023 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
well your events aren't exactly current in 1748


[1/24/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
"currentish"


[1/24/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
but actually


[1/24/2023 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I am currently organizing my events by YYYY/MM/eventname.md


[1/24/2023 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
why not just have Events/YYYY/MM folders and then Events/Unsorted for top level stuff


[1/24/2023 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
then we could have historical events tend to live in the YYYY folders themselves instead of YYYY/MM folders


[1/24/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
what I mean is that an event like: the Unification of Sembara under the House of Sewick


[1/24/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
is a very different kind of thing than a day-and-date specific event


[1/24/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't really thought about how to manage historical events, but one of my goals for the next few weeks is to rewrite the chronicle of the house of sewick to (a) be more obsidian friendly and (b) take into account the timeline shifts we discussed a month ago


[1/24/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
but anyway, for the moment I think Events/YYYY/MM works


[1/24/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
and we can have Unsorted and things in YYYY as well


[1/24/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
if we crate a separate Events/Historical or something like that, fine


[1/24/2023 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
can also have a generic top level "Historical Events" for things that span more than a year until we figure out a better thing to do with them


[1/24/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
don't have to sort out right now


[1/24/2023 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
under events I mean, so Events/Historical


[1/24/2023 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
so it would be 
Events
-->Unsorted
-->Historical
-->YYYY


[1/24/2023 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/24/2023 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and then MM/eventname.md under YYYY


[1/24/2023 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
one question: would you ever want to use it for events that haven't yet happened?


[1/24/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I keep events that haven't happened in my DM notes exclusively


[1/24/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
I guess ostly those stay in _DM_ until the come up in play


[1/24/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
for items I am less sure sharing makes sense to be honest


[1/24/2023 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
mostly because of all the forward links to visions in the mirror


[1/24/2023 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
and because a lot of items are pretty campaign-specific


[1/24/2023 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I guess most items are pretty campaign specific, and it is hard to keep forward links to campaign notes out of the items entirely


[1/24/2023 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess it makes sense to leave those separate for now, the handful of broken links probably don't really matter


[1/24/2023 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
just pushed preliminary event reorg


[1/24/2023 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
everything is in unsorted that was in historical notes


[1/24/2023 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
we can always unshare specific items if the broken links bother us


[1/24/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/24/2023 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
did you actually push?


[1/24/2023 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not seeing a change


[1/24/2023 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
ah oops no, pushed now


[1/24/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
let's stick with capitalizing type categories, e.g. we have NPC, PC, Item, Ruler, Place, Building, so event should be Event

Can you send the chat gpt link over discord or email? Being a non mac user I cant see imessage on my computer


[8/8/2023 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
But in general I think the idea is great, my only thought would be to emphasize the local miracle holidays as well, i.e. if there are 4 holidays on the calendar they shouldn't all be these "generic domain" holidays


[8/8/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
And I also wouldn't worry about balance or precision, i.e. there is no reason why there has to be one "generic" holiday for each divine, I suspect that these "generic" holidays would probably mostly be quite ancient and harken back to Drankor or even H'kar, although people wouldn't necessarily know that


[8/8/2023 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
And not ever ancient holiday from Drankor surived. But the domain holidays would tend to be the ones that *everyone* celebrated in some fashion across the wide set of Mos Numena traditions.

[8/8/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
agree about not needing balance. I only make up holidays for background for current events in the campaign so all I care about now is a winter holiday in Tollen


[8/8/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
On holidays, I really liked the basic idea for Twilight Revelry, Travelers Vigil, and Benevlonet Shaows


[8/8/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
I'm quite interested in the holidays topic because my game is currently mid-Nov, and the next session is going to be a minor events/roleplaying/downtime that time skips through the winter


[8/8/2023 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm working on Twilight Revelry now - basic idea is that in Drankor this was the "day between the years" when everything is upended, people party, and social norms are cast aside, kind of like Saturnalia + Carnivale. Key thing being masks, parades, feasting, probably riddle contests/games of chance


[8/8/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
So having a holiday or two to provide some focus would be perfect


[8/8/2023 5:46 PM] rsulfuratus
in Sembara/Tollen celebrated on Dec 31st.


[8/8/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
I think having 4 major winter holidays doesn't feel right, so I want to use twlight relvery + 1 more at most

{Reactions}
👍

[8/8/2023 5:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Traveler's Vigil, Benevolent Shadows also great - wouldn't necessarily bunch everything up though


[8/8/2023 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
benevolent shadows idea doesn't need any reason to be winter-associated


[8/8/2023 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
could have traveler's vigil and twilight revelry as major "universal-ish" winter holidays


[8/8/2023 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
No, although traveler's vigil doesn't either, although just for metagame reasons I like it better (one of my PCs is a paladin of the wanderer so I think he'd appreciate that holiday a bit more)


[8/8/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
What is traveler's vigil wasn't the solistce but the last full moon before the solistce or something like that. Would space it out a bit more from Twilight and also potentially leave open the solistice


[8/8/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
In the real world, holidays do sometimes bunch up -- think Rosh Hashanah / Yom Kippur / Sukkot


[8/8/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
So I could imagine, say, Vigil is moon-aspected (full or new) and in winter, but before the solstice. The solstice is not a big deal in Mos Numena, but some highland kingdoms might celebrate a kestavo-inspired type thing, and then twilight relevery comes at new years


[8/8/2023 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I like that


[8/8/2023 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
Mos Numena originally founded in tropical/subtropical area


[8/8/2023 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
So solstice maybe not a big deal in drankor particularly


[8/8/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
Right, winter solistce not a big deal in Drankor/H'kar --


[8/8/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
actually having Traveler's Vigil on the last new moon of the year would be perfect for the timing of my game


[8/8/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
The current date is Dec 4th and in 1719 the last new moon is Dec 6th


[8/8/2023 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
last full moon in 1719 is Dec 20th, so actually that works as well


[8/8/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I think makes more sense as full moon


[8/8/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
But doesn’t really matter

In Sembara (and probably Tollen, and other places where winter weather is bad for travel) I was thinking it would be a bit of a marking point in the year -- it is unluckly for travelers to not be home by then, unless they were not coming home for the winter at all, in which case it would be a tradition to send them prayers. So a bit of a combination of celebration of homecoming and prayers for those not at all


[8/8/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
not at home


[8/8/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
The other idea would be to make it an auspicious time to begin a journey and move it to the summer or spring


[8/8/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
Thinking about it more, I don't love the vibe of "tell us about your travels" as opposed to having an association with actual travel. ALthough hospitality is part of the wanderer as well


[8/8/2023 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe the drankorian year actually ended on the solstice, and the days between the solstice and the new year were associated with magic and ritual and ended with the twilight revelry. Travelers Festival was the last holiday of the year and even back then had the same connotations, not because of weather but for mystical reasons


[8/8/2023 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
But I also like association with beginning journeys


[8/8/2023 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
So a couple of ideas:

* Spring time festival, mostly about being a time to start a journey / change in life / etc
* Winter time, a time of homecoming
* Winter time, with an association of both homecoming and hospitality -- so both a celebration for the returning travelers and a celebration of welcoming and hospitality and community, with some wassailing/giving food/etc connotations


[8/8/2023 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Or it could have been an auspicious time to start journeys in drankor but now has a different vibe


[8/8/2023 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
I think any of them could work, #2 feels like it makes it more minor, #3 feels like it would be big, which might overshadow twlight thingy, which might not be what you want


[8/8/2023 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I think 3 makes sense. It would have a bit of Christmas / new years vibe but I think that’s fine


[8/8/2023 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Having holidays cluster makes them feel more real imo,


[8/8/2023 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[8/8/2023 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
I suspect I'm going to get carried away and decide to write up both these holidays as each of my players would have experienced them, mostly for fun.
In Tyrwingha, in a fey tinged village dedicated to the Wyrdling
In Tyrwingha, in a small market town decided to <undecided divine>
In Embry
In the highland kingdoms, as a dwarf traveler would experience them

I doubt it will be tonight but I have some ideas. Send me whatever you make up so I can fit it in


[8/8/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I’ll send a doc tonight with some unites thoughts


[8/8/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
*initial


[8/8/2023 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Plus of course I need to decide how it would be celebrated in Cleenseau, which is dedicated to the warlord but unusually has a strong secondary wanderer vibe due to some ancient traveler/inn shrines that are still used


[8/8/2023 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
The Insingue community should have its own ritual on travelers night in remebrance of the travelers who are lost (maybe?) but feels like an opportunity for something unique


[8/8/2023 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
would it mess up the timing of your game to have the traveler thing as the first full moon in the new year, instead of the first full moon before the solistice?


[8/8/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
No, doesn’t matter much


[8/8/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that could make an interesting historical point, where in drankor mirthblaze/twilight revelry/whatever was the ending point of the year and then early january is the new beginning


[8/8/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
and in the south  january would be a good time for new journeys, etc


[8/8/2023 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
but not sure


[8/8/2023 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
That changes the holiday to more of a leave-taking rather than home coming


[8/8/2023 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i am wondering if it is interesting to develop it as a holiday with ancient leave-taking roots but which has acquired new meaning in the Greater Sembaran tradition


[8/8/2023 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps leaving open the idea that it has a very different flavor in Chardon


[8/8/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was wondering about 2 festivals or holy days of the traveler, on in early Dec and one in early Feb. the first was the historical “home coming” the second the historical “leave taking”


[8/8/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that could work


[8/8/2023 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
With Drankorian roots having a bit of a “you are supposed to be home between Dec and Feb” vibe


[8/8/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that


[8/8/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
then perhaps the early Dec homecoming could be the one that has diverged a bit among traditions and perhaps merged a bit with northern/kestavo solistice celebrations


[8/8/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
and the feb one is more universal


[8/8/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
But actually I kinda like the idea of the ancient Drankorian festival of departure and leave-taking in early Jan changing significantly in the north to a different vibe, as leaving home in Jan doesn’t make sense


[8/8/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
Ie either idea could work pretty well


[8/8/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so from a meta perspective I think the extent to which you want to play around with kestavo solistic traditions might be the determining factor


[8/8/2023 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
in a Dec homecoming + Feb leavetaking,  the Dec homecoming is the opportunity to borrow from Kestavo stuff, but there probably isn't space for a separate Kestavo solstice holiday


[8/8/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
I’m more interested in playing around with fey-adjacent traditions in Tyrwingha


[8/8/2023 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
But I don’t think it has to be solstice per se, and in fact in Tyrwingha there might be a whole different situation related to Ethlenn


[8/8/2023 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
I am also not sure the Mos Numena holidays matter there as much


[8/8/2023 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
And I’m not sure solstice matters there.


[8/8/2023 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
In the Cleenseau game I don’t think it would immediately come up


[8/8/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
putting the homecoming celebration at the first full moon before the solistic would put it on Nov 28 in 1748, which is convenient for the meta-reason of not having a major holiday happening while you were in Tollen and not mentioned (although this isn't a major issue IMO)


[8/8/2023 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
I gotta check 1719, I am not at my computer but I think the full moon was like Dec 19. I don’t want my players to have missed it, current date is Dec 4


[8/8/2023 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Dec 20 in 1719


[8/8/2023 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
It also doesn’t have to be lunar - drankor / mos Numena is not necessary a particularly lunar religion


[8/8/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
But I think this all works nicely. In Drankor, there were three big holidays, in the winter.  The “traveler homecoming” in late Nov/early Dec, then the wyrdling reveal in new years, then the “traveler leavetaking” in Feb.


[8/8/2023 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
The last might have been more minor,  but in Drankor the time between the two traveler holidays was seen as mystically important to not travel


[8/8/2023 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
Or whatever that connotation might have been lost.


[8/8/2023 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
In the kestavo tradition there probably is/was a solstice festival but it isn’t much alive in sembara,  but some northern kingdoms might still honor the solstice. But most people would not really celebrate it except as some traditions merging with the dec holiday


[8/8/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of imagine Drankor as having this very ritual calendar, with lots of days with magical purposes in a way, the reasons having been lost to time

{Reactions}
👍

[8/8/2023 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway this is getting a bit beyond what I need for session prep and I still have to clean up the kitchen. I added a bunch of notes on Mirthblaze / whatever (still not sure about the name) to the google doc


[8/8/2023 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I do think it might make sense to set the homecoming festival to a fixed date, instead of based on the moon, though. maybe this was in Drankorian days celebrated also as the miracle of salvation, the day of thanks for when the gods rescued the Drankorians from the fall of Hkar?


[8/8/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
that could be pretty interesting - it could give it a fixed date sometime in Dec (after Dec 4th, but not when you all were in Tollen), it could give it an interestingly different gloss in Sembara and Chardon, where in Sembara it kind of merges with local solstice traditions and the imperial connotations fade


[8/8/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but perhaps this is not the right holiday for that


[8/8/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway feel free to play around however suits you with these ideas


[8/8/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Mos Numena could use a whole ritual calendar at some point. it is a little more complicated than the ritual calendar for the Dunmari Paantheon since Mos Numena is so diverse, but might be worth thinking about. there should probably be 6-10 relatively universal holidays with a bunch of smaller regional/local feast days overlaid


[8/8/2023 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
Agreed


[8/8/2023 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I had a lot of fun making the Dunmari ritual calendar. i think it is also really helpful for developing myths since often there will be myths associated with festivals, although perhaps less so for mos numena which is fairly diverse and diffuse, compared to dunmar where it is the state and cultural religion


[8/8/2023 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
I think the Mos Numena myths are really diverse. I like that the gods don’t really have personalities per se


[8/8/2023 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
So there is no story of when the Traveler did something


[8/8/2023 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
right like drankorian miracles don't really resonate in sembara


[8/8/2023 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
even the day of salvation or whatever that acknowledges the miracle of being rescued from hkar might have kind of lost its meaning over the years, especially as in drankor it would have never been associated with a specific god, and more celebrated as a national holiday


[8/8/2023 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
It’s all about blessings to the humans in their culture. To the Drankorians a lot of the divine is tied into magic, right?


[8/8/2023 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, and organized magic. this is my idea behind the ritual calendar and things like the intercalary days at the end of the year


[8/8/2023 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
this would have been associated with specific (now lost) magical practices


[8/8/2023 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
like maybe you can create a portal to another plane if you cast a specific spell each day during the 10 days of what is now mirthblaze


[8/8/2023 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[8/8/2023 9:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Have you invented anything about Insingue, really? I am trying to get a bit of a sense of the culture, like what would their unique take on Mirthblaze be? Culturally they are fairly Sembaran, I guess


[8/8/2023 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
No, not really


[8/8/2023 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
All I have on them is in the March of Andonne doc in drive


[8/8/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
But none of it was really about insingue


[8/8/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
More about the refugee culture in Aurbez which I think might be fairly different from what Insingue was actually like


[8/8/2023 10:03 PM] rsulfuratus
our assumption is Insingue was a pretty fertile and wealthy agricultural region, right? before the plague it would have been like southern france or tuscany or something, I guess, although perhaps a bit more rain


[8/8/2023 10:04 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, wealthy and fertile for sure. Big trade with Cymea and Sembara and perhaps even out to Chardon.


[8/8/2023 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
In high school it was around where Beryl was from


[8/8/2023 10:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[8/8/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
It has always been a bit of a cipher though


[8/8/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
Like, why is there a big city there? Was it more cymean or sembaran?


[8/8/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
I think in the Drankorian expansion notes there were not many humans in the region when drankor expanded into it


[8/8/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
I always imagine it as river town


[8/8/2023 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, definitely a river town


[8/8/2023 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I always thought of it as kind of Drankorian but always like the second city of the empire, that survived the plague and rebuilt but took on a kind of independent spirit


[8/8/2023 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
the scholars fled west, the merchants fled to cymea, and the pioneers fled to insingue


[8/8/2023 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe it was protected from the first plague that destroyed drankor by some powerful magic so it has this kind of refuge in a land of devastation feeling right after the fall of the drankorian empire


[8/8/2023 10:11 PM] rsulfuratus
but had always been kind of a hotbed of anti-imperial sentiment (maybe some simmering remnants of the pre-Apolloyon civil war there)


[8/8/2023 10:11 PM] .deciusmus
Independence is a good key idea, it certainly fits in with the refugee culture in Maseau and south I’ve very lightly developed


[8/8/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe a free trade place as well


[8/8/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
insingue to drankor is almost exactly the distance from rome to cairo. could have a kind of eyppt during roman times vibe


[8/8/2023 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
close enough you can get grain shipments down the river and trade, but far enough away it isn't directly under the imperial thumb


[8/8/2023 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
It also could have been completely different during the Drankorian times. Maybe before the plague it was a sleepy river port funneling grain south to drankor from (one of?) the breadbasket of the empire


[8/8/2023 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
right, doesn't necessarily matter that far back


[8/8/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
Then some historically contingent set of leaders escapes the plague to Insingue and it gets this reputation as something else — an anti-imperial / we are very much not drankor rebirth


[8/8/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
But in reality this is a contrast with Cymea not Drankor


[8/8/2023 10:17 PM] rsulfuratus
right, the important thing is that in the east Cymea initially has the kind of Drankor-continued vibe and Isingue is explicitly not that


[8/8/2023 10:18 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[8/8/2023 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think its wealth would be from agriculture more than trade - it is on an important river and at a crossroads of cymea/sembara trade to dunmar and on to chardon, but as it is completely landlocked it is hard for it to be a really major trading power


[8/8/2023 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus
my mental model is kind of southern france


[8/8/2023 10:20 PM] .deciusmus
You could imagine three major post Drankorian urban cultures—
Chardon is the “we will become greater than even our Drankorian roots” culture, Cymea the “relish the past, we will never improve on it” culture, and Insingue is the “we are nothing at all like Drankor, we reject its principles” culture


[8/8/2023 10:21 PM] .deciusmus
By why a big city in southern france? Or maybe insignue is not very urban and it is the dense agricultural land not the city itself that matters (as the city is small)


[8/8/2023 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think of insingue as particularly a big city


[8/8/2023 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the river valley would be densely settled with many small towns, so fairly high population density, but not sure that insingue would really be a huge city by itself


[8/8/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah actually that makes sense


[8/8/2023 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe historically the region was called something different, but Insingue is a symbol and now has kind of a "well are all insinguese" vibe


[8/8/2023 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I had the name Isatabor Alliance somewhere


[8/8/2023 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking similar but also that maybe Insingue was major (intellectual/religious/magical?) focus so everyone in the region saw it as something important


[8/8/2023 10:26 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I think that was the name of the region


[8/8/2023 10:26 PM] .deciusmus
/ political entity


[8/8/2023 10:27 PM] rsulfuratus
right, Insingue was a center, no doubt, and kind of a cultural capital, but not necessarily hugely populated


[8/8/2023 10:28 PM] .deciusmus
Right I think that works well


[8/8/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
How about Revelfire for a name for the twilight revelry / wyrdling one?


[8/8/2023 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
I like that well enough. Although I wouldn’t discount fake Latin either


[8/8/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm yeah maybe fake latin woud be better


[8/8/2023 10:44 PM] .deciusmus
On Insignue, here’s one idea…
Something about the waters of the river near / in Insignue has healing and fertility properties. This works on soil too so the land is unusually rich. This attracts folks, but a rejection of the Drankorian ritual study leads the people who come here to be much more mystical/divine magic so a university doesn’t develop but the town becomes a cult center for Mos Numena and a place of divine connection. This is never large, but there is plenty of wealth in the soil, and the small towns are all attached very strongly to the place they get the magic plant growing (and human fertility causing) water


[8/8/2023 10:45 PM] .deciusmus
This generates a lot of wealth and a cultural focus (and an interesting magical twist, did Cha’mutte corrupt the healing power? Or suppress it?)


[8/8/2023 10:46 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm yeah that is quite interesting


[8/8/2023 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
and could explain why the acidic ooze there now has grown so big


[8/8/2023 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
But the rejection of drankor leads to a lot of New England style town meetings and local rule, united  by this shared heritage / culture / economic / magical connection back to the source of the water


[8/8/2023 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
probably makes sense to have a bit of a druidic focus, which would also be consistent with beryl's backstory


[8/8/2023 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that works


[8/8/2023 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps the rangers could also have an insinguese root, maybe originally as the guardians of these magical waters


[8/8/2023 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
they existed in the high school campaign so need to have a pre-Great-War origin story


[8/8/2023 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
and also a reason to be heavily focused specifically on the southern border of Sembara


[8/8/2023 10:50 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[8/8/2023 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus
could also contribute to the cultural relevancy of insigue - this would be the rangers headquarters or mystical center or something


[8/8/2023 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus
might push the rangers towards the "reclaim isingue" side in your campaign, not sure if that works or not


[8/8/2023 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno-  they could easily see themselves as the guardians of the humans who escaped more than reclaimed land


[8/8/2023 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps there are factions between those who believe the waters can be restored and those who don’t


[8/8/2023 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm yeah that could be interesting


[8/8/2023 10:53 PM] .deciusmus
The rangers might be originally and at heart the guardians of the magic of the land, not the cultural trappings of the city


[8/8/2023 10:54 PM] .deciusmus
So reclaiming the town -
Who cares


[8/8/2023 10:54 PM] .deciusmus
Reclaiming the magic -
Key


[8/8/2023 10:54 PM] .deciusmus
And if it seemed important for them to be on a side, Beryl could have told them whether reclaiming the water is possible


[8/8/2023 10:55 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe beryl thought it was possible and told Rai and the Bhishma monks to try it......................


[8/8/2023 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
That would be awesome


[8/8/2023 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
But I’ll let you decide if it really happened 😀


[8/8/2023 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
When was Rai and the monks?


[8/8/2023 10:56 PM] .deciusmus
It was like 1720s, right?


[8/8/2023 10:56 PM] rsulfuratus
1718


[8/8/2023 10:57 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe Rai succeeded and the magical water is now super back and giving major fertility power to the giant acid monster


[8/8/2023 10:57 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe


[8/8/2023 10:59 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure how big a role the rangers play in your campaign but feel free to have some reverberations echoing back to the rangers via beryl if it make sense


[8/8/2023 10:59 PM] .deciusmus
It’s my bedtime but I might try to add a few thoughts on holidays to your doc tomorrow. I like this stuff about Insignue, I’d imagine that the key vibe is these small, self-governing argicultural towns that associate closely with this magic water


[8/8/2023 11:00 PM] rsulfuratus
raises the big question of why did beryl and rai think they could succeed, and why were they wrong? but that is for the level 20 one-shot later on

{Reactions}
👍

[8/8/2023 11:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I have to go to bed too


[8/9/2023 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
fiddling around with calendar ideas a bit while eating lunch. I think that it would be interesting to have the original Hkar/Drankorian calendar be much more reminiscent of a Mayan-style calendar than traditional European/Mesoptamian lunisolar calendrs. so maybe in Hkar you have a ritual cycle of 50 weeks, each of 7 days, plus 15 intercalary days that make up a 365 day year. months are for convenience, and consist of 10 months of 5 weeks each.


[8/9/2023 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
it is the mariner tradition that creates a lunisolar calendar


[8/9/2023 2:08 PM] rsulfuratus
when the Drankorian empire falls, the intercalary days are dropped/forgotten about, and you get a synchronization with the mariner-derived lunisolar calendar


[8/9/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
main modern day implication would be that Mos Numena holidays probably shouldn't be lunar oriented, and instead would most likely be associated with solar year landmarks (solistice/equinox), or fixed dates for various reasons


[8/9/2023 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
because a year in exactly 365 days in taelgar, you don't need leap years and solar-year landmarks are always fixed to a specific date. that means you could also do something like have a holiday that was originally the first day of the last week of the 6th month and have that be celebrated on june 28th every year for reasons no one is quite sure why now


[8/9/2023 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
I like that

then I just paste in a bunch of my notes and it usually does a pretty good job pulling out the relevant information. I have to tell it the current date, and tell it when the party last saw it, and a few other little details

I also have a note cleanup instruction set, here: https://github.com/tsackton/taelgar/blob/main/_MoC/Metadata.md#reformat-note-instructions

[9/9/2023 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
these could probably be refined a bit but worked pretty well when I was doing a bunch of NPC cleanup a few weeks ago


[9/9/2023 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
thanks


[9/9/2023 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
I went ahead with Twilight's Grace for now, because I hate having [[Untitled Fey Realm]] in Obsidian, but it won't come up in game so can be changed


[10/29/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
I'm working on some cleanup of Sembaran history... My PCs are going to expore some ruins underneath Cleenseau and I wanted to have a clearer picture of what the ruins might be from...


[10/29/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
what do you think of the following short narrative of hobgoblins

After the death of Cha'mutte there were two major hobgoblin hordes: one in the north and one in the south.

The southern horde was more badly damaged from the Great War itself, the plagues, and other activities, and rapidly split into two major clans: The Bitter Knife clan, who fought a thirty year war with the Dunmari before being defeated, and the Iron Fang clan, who pushed north and were mostly defeated by Sembara, but also settled on the edges of the Plaguelands.

The northern horde mostly pushed south to Chardon, but a smaller part (the Shattered Ice clan) regrouped and then attempted over the 1550s and 1560s to cross the Sentinal Range into Sembara. These were mostly pushed back by the dwarves and highland kingdoms in the 1550s and early 1560s.

In the 1570s, however, this remanent regroups, perhaps with some hobgoblins being pushed east by Chardon, and attacks in alliance with mind-flayers in the west of Sembara. This is the First Hobgoblin War. It ends somewhat inconclusively, with the mind-flayers kept out of main Sembaran terrority but the hobgoblins clearly still a threat.

In the 1580s, they burst west again, overwhelming the Sembaran defenses and establishing the Dominion of <Something>

By 1600, the remanents of the Chardonian hordes were regrouping in the southern Sentinel Range, under the banner of the Blackened Claw. The (much larger) remenants of the Shattered Ice clan had established dominion over a broad swath of land from the Sentinel Range along the headwaters of the Enst and as far east as the edge of the Mostreve Hills on the borders of Addermarch.


[10/29/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
Between 1603 and 1610 the Dunmari pushed the Blackened Claw north and east, and by 1610, the situation is:

* The land between the Sentinel Range and the Istaros, south of the Masance and the Andonne Rivers is a no-man's land, and scattered bands of hobgoblins mostly from the defeated Blackened Claw and Iron Fang clans roam here, but there are no large established kingdoms
* The  Dominion of <Something> rules from the height of the eastern borders of the Elderwood, across the Sentinel Range, and across the headwaters of the Enst as far as the western Mostreve Hills on the borders of Adderfell
* The Duchy of Maseau is surrounded by hobgoblins and largely cut off from Sembara in the north

For a generation, from 1610 - 1647, an uneasy peace lasts in the region between Sembara and the Dominion of Ice. Sembara pays tribute at times, and the Rangers and others in Maseau wage a endless war of destabilization, trying to keep the hobgoblins disorganized. Leadership within the hobgoblin kingdom is weak. This is also a period when Maseau expands southward. The Great South Road connecting to Tokra is built at this time.

In 1647, the year before Cece comes to the throne, the fourth hobgoblin war errupts as new leadership within the Dominion of Ice turns to conquest pushing up the Enst as far as Fellburn before being turned back by Cece, newly raised to the throne.

In a series of campaigns over several years, Cece rapidly pushes the hobgoblins back, and by 1652 no hobgoblins remain west of Enford. The wall between Dunmore and Enford is built at this time.


[10/29/2023 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
Im not sure I’m happy with the length of time where the hobgoblins are around between 1590 and 1648 though, seems like too long to have parts of western sembara ruled by a hobgoblin kingdom


[10/29/2023 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't given much thought to hobgoblins around Sembara after the Great War. a few key facts though, specifically about the west and the south where I have given this more thought


[10/29/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
first, to set the stage, Cha'mutte commanded the loyalty of almost all significant hobgoblin groups in the lead up to the great war, and during the great war. as part of this, he protected large numbers of hobgoblins in the north around pandar, sustaining them magically. there were other hobgoblins around, presumably - some on the northern border of dunmar, some to the east, etc


[10/29/2023 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
when Cha'mutte is killed, the very large hobgoblin kingdom/civilization living in pandar is left without enough food to survive, and begins to march south, conquering as they go.


[10/29/2023 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
they split into two armies, more or less. the eastern army is led by a conclave of dragons, and conquers through the kingdoms of the elves and denoqai. defeated outside chardon in 1556, largely leaving behind devasted lands


[10/29/2023 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
(As an aside, what I’m really trying to do is have Cleenseau have been a significant military post in the 1580s that was overrun at some point and abandoned and then refounded in the early 1650s)


[10/29/2023 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
the western army is more deliberate moving through human lands, establishing a series of hobgoblin kingdoms, perhaps under the overlordship of a high king or something (details not super relevant) through the 1550s. defeated by chardon as well (in my notes have this actually in 1551, but probably would realistically be a decade or more later)


[10/29/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but this is just a retreat, not a full defeat, since there are hobgoblin kingdoms to retreat to.


[10/29/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
over the next 50 years or something, chardon slowly marches north, freeing the surviving human populations from hobgoblin rule


[10/29/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't worked out the details


[10/29/2023 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
(except in context of mawar, where the mawar renaissance was in the early 1600s, so hobgoblin threat must be largely gone by then, but chardon dominance not yet fully established)


[10/29/2023 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, postulating a serious split in cha'mutte's armies between these eastern and western branches, the timing would work for the survivors of eastern army to flee over the mountains in the 1570s-1580s


[10/29/2023 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
this all works with your shattered ice clan and then a war in the 1580s on the western frontier of sembara


[10/29/2023 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Although my earlier history has a series of@hobgoblin attacks in the late 1550s that are ignored by the crown and lead to the independence of the highland kingdoms. But that isn’t introduced in game anywhere maybe it should be something other than hobgoblins


[10/29/2023 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
lots of things that could be


[10/29/2023 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
Probably making it not hobgoblins is more interesting actually


[10/29/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
So the first serious incursion of hobgoblins to Sembara in the 1570s under Wissym (which is actually hobgoblins commanded by mindflayers ala the original@one shot)


[10/29/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[10/29/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so then in the south you have the bitter knife wars in the 1550s-1580s; the bitter knife clan is the most serious remnant of cha'mutte's southern armies, but is completely defeated by dunmar in the 1580s (ish)


[10/29/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I took that from your Dunmar doc which had the war ending in 1576


[10/29/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
however many hobgoblins end up in the plaguelands and the rough terrain to the east


[10/29/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[10/29/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
these organize various incursions where they can. the blackened claw is one of the more successful


[10/29/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, ok. I thought the blackened claw came from Chardon.


[10/29/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't figured out what happened to the western hobgoblin kingdoms; would prefer to leave that undetermined for now. you might learn more when you go after the piece of rai under the ocean off the coast of that peninsula


[10/29/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
but chardon would have not let any escape south, i don't think


[10/29/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. Actually by moving the 1550s/1560s to non hobgoblin simplifies sembara dramatically


[10/29/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Basically the hobgoblins driven east from Chardon become the shattered ice clan and cause major trouble in 1570s - 1590s.


[10/29/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[10/29/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i think there could be some tension among the hobgoblins - you have a faction that was more on the violent/revenge side, susceptible to manipulation by mind flayers, and faction that is more refugee / wants a place to settle


[10/29/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
after mind flayer war and the stone titan one-shot, you have a bit of stalement and wars back and forth with sembara, but eventually the refugee side makes peace


[10/29/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
The bit I am struggling with is just that the timeline above has the hobgoblins in 1580-1590 and I want Cece to (a) come to power in 1650ish (b) defeat the hobgoblins as she comes to power


[10/29/2023 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
right that is why i'm thinking internal tension in hobgoblins


[10/29/2023 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
the 1580 war is driven by the warmongers, who want to reclaim what was promised by cha'mutte, who escaped the defeat against chardon


[10/29/2023 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
mind flayers use them to launch their war. mind flayers are defeated, and hobgoblins lose but perhaps not all the territory they conquered


[10/29/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
after a decade of a frozen conflict / border skirmishs, perhaps with hobgoblins gaining territory, you have an uneasy peace


[10/29/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
this lasts until 1640 or something


[10/29/2023 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
a new leader comes to power in the hogoblin kingdom (a series of bad winters leads to widespread food shortages, or whatever)


[10/29/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
this new leader launches a war for territory, breaking whatever treaties they had


[10/29/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
sembara decides they can't leave a hobgoblin kingdom on their borders


[10/29/2023 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
of course this changes cece a bit, the second hobgoblin wars. gives them a bit more of a retaliatory flavor, rather than a pure fight for survival


[10/29/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
I actually kinda like her with a bit of nationalist flavor


[10/29/2023 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
could leave exactly what happened in the domanion of whatever undecided / unclear - leaving open the possibility that e.g. another hobgoblin group under the leadership of some non-hobgoblin entity drove the leadership turnover


[10/29/2023 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
But also it is possible that her predecessor launches the war. Things degenerate in the years before he reign, etc. so she comes to power in the midst of a war sembara started but one sembara id losing


[10/29/2023 5:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that could work well


[10/29/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
I also like leaving why it started a bit vague. It was say 1639, which is 90 years ago from my game. No reason a clear description of why it started would be around


[10/29/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right so to summarize, from the perspective of Sembara, after 1549 when the Iron Fang clan is defeated in the Mostreve Hills, no hobgoblins threaten the borders until in 1574, the Shattered Ice Clan, fleeing defeat by Chardonian forces in the west, crosses the Sentinel Range, and in alliance (or subservient to) the mind-flayers, appears


[10/29/2023 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
This, the First Hobgoblin War, ends in 1578, with the defeat of the mind flayers. But Sembara is not unified or strong enough to push the advantage and a substantial remanent of the Shattered Ice clan establishes a homeland just south of Urlich and in the upper headwaters of the Enst


[10/29/2023 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
For the next decade, the Shattered Ice clan skirmishes with Sembaran knights on the borders, and slowly expands their territory, pushing especially a wedge south of the Enst between Maseau and Sembara


[10/29/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
In 1590, in alliance with some of the scattered clans of hobgoblins south of the Andonne, the Shattered Ice clan launches an attack on Maseau. Elaine I, the queen of Sembara at the time, refuses to abandon Maseau and embroils Sembara in the war


[10/29/2023 6:57 PM] .deciusmus
The Second Hobgoblin War lasts from 1590 until 1602. At the end of it, the hobgoblins control a swath of territory fairly far East from the mountains. But the war faction of the hobgoblins have been defeated and exhaustion sets in.


[10/29/2023 6:58 PM] .deciusmus
An uneasy peace is established and the border starts to be fortified (need to look at the map to see where the border would be exactly, but Cleenseau is near it)


[10/29/2023 7:00 PM] .deciusmus
This uneasy peace lasts for a generation, but it is never truly peaceful. Skirmishes frequently break out.


[10/29/2023 7:02 PM] .deciusmus
In 1644, something happens TBD and Sembara starts a new war with the hobgoblins. But it doesn’t go well. By 1647 the hobgoblin army has swept east almost as far as Fellburn.


[10/29/2023 7:02 PM] .deciusmus
(Cleenseau is conquered by the hobgoblins at this point)


[10/29/2023 7:03 PM] .deciusmus
Cece raises and army and pushes the hobgoblins out over a series of campaigns and by 1650 the hobgoblins have been pushed into the deep mountains. Cece stops there, fortifies the borders, and turns to internal affairs


[10/29/2023 7:13 PM] rsulfuratus
That seems about right. Would be good to summarize in the obsidian docs


[10/29/2023 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah working on that


[10/29/2023 7:14 PM] .deciusmus
I also revamped the sembaran royal dates


[10/29/2023 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a rough draft of the history above, plus some cleaned up dates


[10/29/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
great. i really need to organize an overall timeline at some point


[10/30/2023 9:29 AM] rsulfuratus
working out some elven generational dynamics. lmk what you think. basic assumptions are from the demographics spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rMp9eP617CMDdkDgmDRPpOOUbO0TjTY17578DK2wPwo/edit#gid=838085721). assume that most elves survive to 800-900, but many choose to leave the world between 950 - 1150, so basic demographic structure then sets up 7 ka as the "current population", with anyone born more than 7 ka ago clearly a rare elder.

[10/30/2023 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
to put it in 1749 dynamics, you have:
37th ka (born in 1627 +/-), currently the youngest generation, and currently in their wandering/pre-parent phase
36th ka (born in 1467 +/-), the Great War generation, but also the current parental generation, probably sharing most responsibility for community management and governance with the 35th ka
35th ka (born in 1307 +/-), the 'grandparent' generation, probably the main pillar of elven society
34th ka (born in 1147 +/-), the youngest of the 'elder' generations, probably not yet leaving in great numbers,
33th ka (born in 987 +/-), the elders
32nd ka (born in 827 +/-), the oldest of the elder generations
31st ka (born in 667 +/-), the leaving generation, in the midst of departures, rapidly declining in numbers
30th ka and older (born before 507 +/-), the remaining generation, those who decided not to leave the world for whatever reason, small in number and hard to find


[10/30/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
basically you have, at any one time, one generation of "children", two generations of "adults", and three generations of "elders", and then the "post-elders" whatever, but the 7th ka in the past (31st in 1749) would be transitional between elders and "post-elders"


[10/30/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
at one point i thought you had sketched out some idea about transitions in responsbility among the ka but I can't find any notes at the moment


[10/30/2023 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
I had a sketch in email that was basically 3 roles:

The "nurturer", who watches over the young and the homeland
The "caretaker", who watches over the elder races (essentially in charge of foreign policy)
The "unifier", who mediates disputes


[10/30/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
and then an alternating pattern on which generation takes which role


[10/30/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
let me see if I can find what I wrote


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
ah I found it


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
It was in email, too big to paste here


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
in your "Dawn of Everything" worldbuilding phase


[10/30/2023 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
ha, yeah


[10/30/2023 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not wedded to that exact structure for elves, but I do like the idea of rotating leadership based on generations.


[10/30/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah mostly I am trying to figure out who in Orenlas would remember Drankor


[10/30/2023 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
i think from a game perspective it is better if these people are not a dime a dozen, seems weird that there would be mystery about history if most elves can remember 1000 years ago clearly


[10/30/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
I like the basic idea that you have nuturer / caretaker roles that alternate, but it might actually work better to speed up the "die off" of the oldest generations a bit


[10/30/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure most elves remember 1000 years ago clearly

{Reactions}
👍

[10/30/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
Also


[10/30/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
basically I want to set up a distinction between the bulk of elvish society that are in the wanderer / caretaker / nuturer phase and the elders who are beginning to think about leaving to happen around 3-4 generations in the phase


[10/30/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
*past


[10/30/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
but I think that works with your alternating scheme


[10/30/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I think basically they scheme I had no major role for anyone beyond current-2


[10/30/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
So the 34th ka and earlier, are the "elders" in current time


[10/30/2023 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
Also, consider that outside of the "caretaker" phase many elves might not pay that much attention to human history. And I really don't think elves necessarily remember everything clearly either. 

You can even  imagine a sort of intentional forgetting, as part of aging and the changing of the generations, where the focus of a specific elf changes


[10/30/2023 9:51 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[10/30/2023 9:52 AM] .deciusmus
I definitely agree that very old elves are rare, but I think there is probably a fair number of moderately old elves, i.e. who were alive during the Drankorian empire, but who just made no effort to remember that. They've been in the Feywild for 300 years, or whatever, and the mortal world isn't really a concern


[10/30/2023 9:52 AM] rsulfuratus
many very old elves for example may take on a ritual role (like unifiers in your email) and as part of that begin to shed their sense of their earlier life


[10/30/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
I like both an explicit magical/ritual change and also just normal forgetfulness


[10/30/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think this gets at what I wanted, there is kind of a transition around 3-4 ka ago from "normal old person" to "elder" that has very distinct and elven flavor


[10/30/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
some of that is just about forgetting, some about leaving to other planes, some about magic/ritual, etc, but it gives a flavor/transition point that is ~500-600 years ago


[10/30/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
have a meeting now but am going to sketch this out in a bit more detail later today

[10/30/2023 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
Is there a definitive abbrevation for dwarven vs drankorian years? I have been using DR = Drankorian but I see DE in some of your docs


[10/30/2023 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus
I have not been consistent. I think DR for drankorian reckoning is most common


[10/30/2023 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus
Need something else for dwarven years


[10/30/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Your dates for the end of the Drankorian conquest of Sembara (treat @ volta) don't line up

Drankor history has 402 (402 DR: The Treaty of Marhavn ('Mar-hahvn'), signed by Emperor Goristo, establishes the Volta as the northern border of the Drankorian Empire; the Skaer and other descendants of the ancient mariner cultures living in what is now Sembara and Cymea are imperial subjects.)

Tollen history has 414 (In 4547, the Drankorians and the Skaer sign a peace treaty, establishing the [[River Volta|Volta]] as the frontier of the [[Drankorian Empire]]. Tollen, on the north side of the [[River Volta|Volta]], remains technically outside the Drankorian territorial claim.)

Did I do the math wrong? 4547-4133 = 414


[10/30/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
which date is right?


[10/30/2023 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
ah I didn't check the Tollen doc. probably easier to change tollen history doc to 402. they are close enough shouldn't matter


[10/30/2023 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
but I don't really have a strong preference


[10/30/2023 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
I will change Tollen doc


[10/30/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
I have this in my Sembara "new attempt at a timeline":

DR 358: [[Emperor Anates]] campaigns around the [[Mostreve Hills]]
DR 360: [[Emperor Anates]] crosses the [[River Enst|Enst]] and establishes a garrison at [[Cleenseau]]
DR 399: [[Emperor Goristo]] signs the [[Treaty of Tyrwingha]] with [[Archfey Ethlenn|Ethlenn]]
DR 402: The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] ('Mar-hahvn') is signed by [[Emperor Goristo]] 
DR 431: The Drankorian [[Highland Conquest Wars]] end with a tactical retreat by Drankor

I think it is a nicer way to organize history. Trying to move away from the narrative chronology because I find it hard to actually make up stuff when I have to make up all the details to feed into a narrative


[10/30/2023 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
My intention is to fill out the bullets taking bits from the Sembaran Chronicle doc and then delete the Sembaran history chronicle


[10/30/2023 1:31 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I was moving in that direction with the Drankor stuff


[10/30/2023 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
generally I am trying to move more of the taelgarverse stuff to bullet points and accesssible notes, rather than long  narrative

thinking a bit about biology/fertility/lifespan of other species as part of a bit of cleanup of the species directory.


[10/30/2023 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
general idea is: elder races (need new name) are all long-lived but generally not super high fertility, each for somewhat unique reasons. humans, goblinoids, are basically typical Earth human. fey have their own strange relationship with time. other species are basically assumed to be human-like unless there is an obvious lore reason to change them.


[10/30/2023 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
elves: non-overlapping generations, ka, as we've discussed extensively


[10/30/2023 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
stoneborn: kind of think they should actually be born from stone, and gradually turn back to stone.


[10/30/2023 2:20 PM] rsulfuratus
lizardfolk: generally think of lizardfolk as having a very extended old age. mature at same rate as humans, fertility ends at same rate as humans, but they remain active and healthy into their 200s relatively frequently, so just have a really long elder period. makes their culture a very elder-focused. most kids would know not only their grandparents, but their great- and great-great-grandparents, at least


[10/30/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
dwarves: generally think of dwarves as just having really low fertility, kind of a very extended middle age and a relatively short old age. come of age only a little slower than humans (late 20s/early 30s, when they do the heart of the mountain ceremony), but remain capable of bearing children until 150-200, and then often live another 50 years after that


[10/30/2023 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
halflings are most human-like, basically Tolkein-esque, just often living a bit longer than humans


[10/30/2023 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda think lizardfolk need something a little more interesting


[10/30/2023 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah they are the least appealing but not sure what


[10/30/2023 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
I agree on dwarves, halflings, stoneborn


[10/30/2023 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
general idea is elves and stoneborn are the most alien, dwarves and halflings are the most human


[10/30/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
Dwarves probably need something more interesting too, but it is probably private and secret and not *that* different from humans


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the point about dwarves from a worldbuilding perspective is just that they would kind of feel like stretched out humans - you'd have a lot of dwarven familes with 2-3 kids, they would just often be a decade apart


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
they already have the coming of age ceremony, the thuhr, all that, I don't think they need too much weird biology on top of that


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
That's kinda what I meant by not that different.


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
right, makes sense


[10/30/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn't thinking weird biology so much as somewhat non-human marriage and family-rearing customs


[10/30/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like in-game dwarves outside of their homeland are almost always unpaired


[10/30/2023 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense, also can be left to a player who really cares to develop


[10/30/2023 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is true. hadn't noticed that, actually.


[10/30/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
I do have a minor NPC in my game who is a nonbinary dwarve married to a woman. But he is explicitly very undwarven


[10/30/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
*they


[10/30/2023 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
the dwarves in Tokra being a notable exception


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess there was a whole family there


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, it doesn't matter much. I just expect there is something a little more interesting going on in the dwarven marriage and pair-bonding culture than "copied from humans"


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, sure


[10/30/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
But it wouldn't be a world-building thing


[10/30/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Lizardfolk on the other hand.... a few ideas...

hatch from eggs? Maybe culturally there are large rare clutches from just one woman? so lots of siblings, no sense of nuclear families, pairbonding unrelated to child-rearing

a spawn stage after birth, like where they are more fish like and independent?

rapid maturity?


[10/30/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure I like any of those, just brainstorming


[10/30/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
Could be lots of clutches of eggs, with lots of lizard folk "young" not surviving (but I don't really love that, would imply lots of predators eating the young or something)


[10/30/2023 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Communal tending of eggs? Temarie like-learning through the shell? Maybe lizardfolk spend a long time in eggs (several years) and the elders tend to the eggs and lizardfolk hatch knowing how to talk and such


[10/30/2023 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe very conscious control over fertility, so the community plans how many kids to have each year (how many eggs to lay?) and it is all very elder directed and egg laying is not really connected to pair bonding or "family" per se


[10/30/2023 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I think “hatch from eggs” and “primarily aquatic during first few years” are in my notes somewhere


[10/30/2023 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
Could also make them like some fish, maybe they reproduce parthenogenically and have the capability to metamorphose to change sex if desired


[10/30/2023 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
probably want to run some ideas by Eric before making anything canon


[10/30/2023 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
His Mawar lizardfolk character at least had some sense of a “family back home”


[10/30/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Not sure if anyone else has ever played a lizardfolk in a real game


[10/30/2023 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Also in the Kenzo one shot Eric played a lizardfolk who had found a baby lizardfolk abandoned and decided to care for it (it turned out to be something else but the idea of a non-aquatic baby needing care has to at least make sense)


[10/30/2023 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Even if the “find one abandoned” is quite unusual


[10/30/2023 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
another idea. what if the thing about lizardfolk is that they are actually reincarnated. so in order to have a kid you need to convince an ancestor's soul to come back. would give them complete control over fertility since if you don't want a kid you just don't ask.


[10/30/2023 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
from a worldbuilding perspective I think the key idea is that creating a long-lived race that is much less numerous than humans requires some fiddling with fertility and growth rates.


[10/30/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
I like that last one


[10/30/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Although "family back home" doesn't necessarily mean "traditional nuclear family"


[10/30/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
Probably the key thing here, which doesn't need a full answer now, is that lizardfolk have specific conscious control over fertility. So population growth is very managed and they tend to maintain stable populations around the carrying capacity limit of their choosen environments


[10/30/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Which actually makes a ton of worldbuilding sense -- there are no lizardfolk striking out to find new land, for the most part. There could be lizardfolk cultures / communities that are actively expanding, and others than are not, but it would all be very self-conscious and community directed (so not even "each lizardfolk couple" chooses whether to have a kid) but more "each communitiy allocates kids in some fashion"


[10/30/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that works well


[10/30/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
Is it annoying to push notes in %% from emails to documents?


[10/30/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to dump some stuff from emails into the elf page and a few other places


[10/30/2023 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
no that's fine, I put a lot of stuff in %%


[10/30/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
anything in %% is stripped before html conversion so I frequently dump a ton of stuff into docs that way as notes


[10/30/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not always sure the best way to capture various brainstorming and stuff


[10/30/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
there is lots buried away in emails and texts and discord and such


[10/30/2023 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I was trying to get Bard to extract useful information from my gmail but it never really worked


[10/30/2023 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
It isn't that hard to find the emails, honestly, it is more that we use so many different channels (email, Google Drive, text, discord) I can never remember where I wrote something


[10/30/2023 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
text is the least useful, probably better to try to keep worldbuilding stuff out of text. I feel like I'm moving away from Google Drive as well, there is just a lot of legacy stuff there


[10/30/2023 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
although for the green sea stuff it was kind of useful


[10/30/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, agreed


[10/30/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think Google Drive is better for brainstorming and conversation then email or discord, except for quick stuff


[10/30/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
It is easier to move stuff from drive -> obsidian than anything else


[10/30/2023 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
that's true


[10/30/2023 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
Obsidian is hard to have a back-and-forth in


[10/30/2023 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
Although we haven't tried PRs


[10/30/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
Which I don't think is great for brainstorming


[10/30/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure


[10/30/2023 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
my general goal is to keep obsidian for "settled" stuff


[10/30/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
that's fair


[10/30/2023 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
at least in the main directories - worldbuiling folder and my DM notes are separate


[10/30/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[10/30/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
Although I'm not sure about the best approach for "medium" stuff, i.e. the history of Sembara


[10/30/2023 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe the best system is to use google drive for that too. but i guess my impression is you were doing a lot of the hobgoblin/sembaran history specificaly to create the backstory for a dungeon, so at that point I would consider it canon


[10/30/2023 6:17 PM] .deciusmus
I am


[10/30/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
can put stuff that is a bit wobbly in %%


[10/30/2023 6:17 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm going a bit beyond what I strictly need for the dunegon


[10/30/2023 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
and I have some random stuff I don't know if you care about, like deciding the date that Drankor and Ethleen signed or treaty, or the date a certain garrison was founded by a Drankorian Emperor


[10/30/2023 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm, right. i sort of feel like that ancillary stuff is basically fine to just leave, it is probably a bit too complicated to worry explicitly about a system for things like that. if we ever end up with conflicts between different parts of the world bible can just fix them quietly (like the date for the drankor treaty establishing volta as northern border)


[10/30/2023 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
where a PR might be useful is for a major update to world history outside of a clear game need, e.g. if you wanted to develop the history of cymea in more detail or something like that


[10/30/2023 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
I was wondering if some of that stuff is worth PRing


[10/30/2023 6:23 PM] .deciusmus
It isn't like approvals are *required*, so it would be pretty easy for me to push a PR for stuff I'm clarifying outside of the "main" sembaran arc


[10/30/2023 6:23 PM] .deciusmus
and if you didn't get a chance to look at the PR, so what? I could always just merge anyway


[10/30/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[10/30/2023 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess my general feeling is true brainstorming is best in worldbuilding notes or google docs still but it would be worth thinking about using PRs a bit for substantial updates


[10/30/2023 6:26 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I agree on true brainstorming


[10/30/2023 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing I am working on very slowly is trying to make sure at least stub notes exist for everything, with the general format of dumping everything I have from my old onenote docs plus email/gdrive into a bit %% note at the end


[10/30/2023 6:27 PM] rsulfuratus
(I am working on a obsidian-based player's guide a little bit, partially in the context of this low level adventure I want to run which will likely be for various guests from the one-shots last year, since I don't think anyone from the main campaign has time to play more than every other week)


[10/30/2023 7:47 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at your PR now


[10/30/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
how much of the Addermarch stuff that you made up for the family game do you want to keep as canon? I keep shying away from Addermarch because I don't have a good sense of it from that game


[10/30/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I didn't really ever make up much history or politics. I do like the city of Addermarch and the apple theme and the brandy houses


[10/30/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
think that could probably fit no matter the history


[10/30/2023 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
(Isaac wants to play his character from that game again someday, and Nathaniel is now doing a D&D club at school, so I don't want to totally dump everything from that game as Isaac wants to return to Addermarch and do occasional one shots if he can convince anyone else)


[10/30/2023 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
I'm mapping out the Third Hobgoblin War in a bit more detail, and trying to figure out Addermarch's place it in


[10/30/2023 8:34 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is canonical that it is an indepedent Earldom with ties to both Tyrwingha and Sembara (earl being a Tyrwinghan title anyway)


[10/30/2023 8:35 PM] .deciusmus
I have this basic idea that the Shattered Ice Clan came out of the Sentinel Range and thrust down the Enst, eventually forming a kingdom approximately in the red section:

[10/30/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
(and perhaps even a bit farther into the section labelled "borderlands')


[10/30/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
(partly, this is in service of the goal of having Cleenseau being a border fort / interior town / border fort / interior town in cycles to drive some undiscovered ruins beneath the current town)


[10/30/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I am copying all my OneNote addermarch notes to Obsidian now, will push (in worldbuilding) soon


[10/30/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but basically I don't have anything developed (at least that I care about) regarding poltiical history of the area. if they were on the border of a hobgoblin kingdom in the 1600s it doesn't matter to me.


[10/30/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
the only stuff I particulary want to keep is the current day vibe

{Reactions}
👍

[10/30/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
Actually, thinking about it, I wonder if the hobgoblins pushed all the way to the border with Tyrwingha, cutting off Addermarch effectively


[10/30/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
that would work too


[10/30/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
(Do you care about "TM1 and TM2" btw on the map?


[10/30/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
no


[10/30/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
We originally had some Tyrwinghan marches, but the development of Tyrwingha so far hasn't really had a place for them


[10/30/2023 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus

[10/30/2023 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but again a lot of that can change, just want to keep the basic vibe. i think it works actually if addermarch feels kind of isolated in general


[10/30/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
Is there any canon on how/when the wall in western Sembara was built?


[10/30/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
Did it exist in the one-shot against the stone titan?


[10/30/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
The vibe you describe in those notes is pretty Tyrwinghan, in a way, actually. I could imagine Addermarch being somewhat isolated and also somewhat closer to Tyrwingha than Sembara


[10/30/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
my notes from the stone titan one-shot are pretty ambiguous about whether the western sembara fortifications exist at that time


[10/30/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
that works imo


[10/30/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
I'm leaning towards "the Sentinel Range War" in the early 1560s (mostly the highland kingdoms and dwarves) being against something really scary and inspiring a period of fortifications in the 1560s in the west, which seem prophetic when the 1st hobgoblin war is in that area.

The wall is extended in the 1570s after the 1st hobgoblin war, but the 2nd and 3rd hobgoblin wars are fought along the Enst, not the western frontier


[10/30/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
Cece then, during the long peace, invests a fair bit in border defense, which includes strengthing and supporting Maseau and Addermarch and wall-building in the west


[10/30/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the original reason for the wall on the map was the idea that the devastion around Urlich is still a cursed place and occasionally spawns weird monsters and other terrors that need to be stopped


[10/30/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So maybe its just been a continual project since way back in the immediate aftermath of the Great War that has grown in fits and starts


[10/30/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
(weird terrors from Urlich is important for the long-term plot arc of my game as that's where the underdark section is intended to be)


[10/30/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
But, the wall is also the only part of Sembara that isn't defended by a river or an allied kingdom


[10/30/2023 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Dunmore at least was a fortified border town during the 1st hobgoblin war, presuming that is the setting for the stone titan one shot (never canonically had a year just "aftermath of great war")


[10/30/2023 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but actually probably makes sense for their not to be a wall there in 1570 or whenever - especially as in the 1550s Sembara is in pretty dire straights in general and might not have had resources for a huge wall project


[10/30/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe the central section is first right after great war, and slowly grows north and south until it meets rivers or something


[10/30/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure it matters a ton though the exact timing, unless relevant for your war pacing


[10/30/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
No, it isn't relevant


[10/30/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
Was just thinking about it as an aside


[10/30/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
So here’s my rough notes… names will likely change..

Sentinel Range War - 1560ish. Mostly highland kingdoms, minimal impact on Sembara.


[10/30/2023 10:08 PM] .deciusmus
1st hobgoblin war- 1570s. Dunmore and western sembara bear the brunt


[10/30/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
Pushed back eventually - but a large reserve of hobgoblins ends up south of Urlich


[10/30/2023 10:12 PM] .deciusmus
2nd hobgoblin war - the hobgoblins pushes east along the Enst valley. Lots of back and forth and borderland destruction. Mostly focused on the lands south of the Enst. Addermarch and Maseau cut off


[10/30/2023 10:16 PM] .deciusmus
Unsettled peace. Not sure how it comes about but hobgoblins end up settling in a wide band from the marches of enford to the borderlands east of addermarch. This is a tough time for Maseau in particular as trade through the hobgoblin lands is rare and highly taxed and there are many downsides to being a relatively weak power on the border of a hobgoblin kingdom


[10/30/2023 10:16 PM] .deciusmus
Addermarch does better, being protected somewhat by the hills and drawing closer to Tyrwingha


[10/30/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
3rd hobgoblin war started by Sembara at the behest of Maseau. Starts badly, but ends in a series of 3 summer campaigns that push the hobgoblins entirely west of enford.


[10/30/2023 10:22 PM] .deciusmus
At the end of the 3rd war there are still scattered remnants of the hobgoblin clans in the mountains south of Urlich but they don’t regain enough strength during the Cece years to be more than a nuscrnse in the rest of sembara


[10/30/2023 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
By 1740 the@hobgoblins might be entirely gone or there could@still be skirmishes now and then depending on what makes sense for current day


[10/30/2023 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
when is 3rd war?


[10/30/2023 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
1646-1650


[10/30/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
2nd is 1590-1600


[10/30/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
So the unsettled peace is 1600-1645


[10/30/2023 10:27 PM] .deciusmus
(I have set the stage in 1719 that the western army definitely does fight real skirmishes and battles most summers, but it could be the campaigns to wipe out hobgoblins which could have succeeded by 1730/1740)


[10/30/2023 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus
the main enemy in the addermarch campaign was hobgoblins based in the edge of the plaguelands south of addermarch


[10/30/2023 10:29 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a whole different set of hobgoblins in the south


[10/30/2023 10:29 PM] .deciusmus
The remnants of the army that Derik III defeated in 1549


[10/30/2023 10:30 PM] rsulfuratus
could actually construct a scenario then where the plagueland hobgoblins and the urlich hobgoblins are actually bitter enemies, and the urlich hobgoblins keep maseau around as a buffer


[10/30/2023 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe one of the goals of the 2nd hobgoblin war is to break through the settled lands and reunite with the southern hobgoblins


[10/30/2023 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
Ooh I like that better


[10/30/2023 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure the implications for aurbez and the march of andonne


[10/30/2023 10:33 PM] .deciusmus
The plague land hobgoblins are also proposed in some notes as having an uneasy relationship that is not always entirely adversarial with the Auzbeg area- sort of a “we keep the worse stuff from moving west and in exchange you don’t follow our raiding parties back East”


[10/30/2023 10:34 PM] .deciusmus
But also I think in 1650 Andonne isn’t settled much


[10/30/2023 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
right, but also that could work going way back actually. perhaps after their defeat the plagueland hobgoblins are actually kind of less interested in expansion


[10/30/2023 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe they turn into like mad scientists or something, and mostly just want to keep to themselves in the plaguelands


[10/30/2023 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
even as far back as the 1600s are making little side deals with the various loose collections of humans who settle on the edges of the plaguelands.


[10/30/2023 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
when the expansionist faction of the urlich hobgoblins gains control they expand quick, but don't want to start a war with the mad scientists and keep some buffer countries around (who of course suffer a lot as they are paying tribute to two masters now)


[10/30/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
actually works with my addermarch lore as well since that was a splinter faction under the influence of a shadowfell warlock


[10/30/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess this would mean i need to start figuring out what kind of ridiculous creation a bunch of mad scientist hobgoblins would make with a city full of living acidic ooze that could challenge a 17th level party

👍

[10/30/2023 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think that all works well although I never envisioned Maseau as paying tribute to hobgoblins much


[10/30/2023 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
In the “dark years” 1600-1645, yes, but probably only to the Urlich ones


[10/30/2023 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
I think the plague lands hobgoblins might have made little side deals with folks in Aurbez and Andonne… but also I kinda like the vibe where many of these people don’t even know there is a hobgoblin kingdom of mad scientists down their


[10/30/2023 10:44 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe it isn’t even only / mostly hobgoblins. Honestly keeping a little mystery seems more fun


[10/30/2023 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
The key thing would be that the hobgoblins of the plague lands don’t seem to be interested in expansion or conquest except some random factions here and there


[10/30/2023 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
(And maybe most humans think that’s because it is only random factions)


[10/30/2023 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
And secondly the urlich hobgoblins were scared/hated/etc them enough to want a human buffer zone


[10/30/2023 10:49 PM] .deciusmus
Actually this works well for the Andonne area as well — the early 1600s see a lot of the refugees who were packed into the Maseau/Enst valley fleeing south, away from the hobgoblins


[10/30/2023 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that works fine


[10/30/2023 10:53 PM] .deciusmus
And perhaps a similar influx of refugees from the Sembaran borderlands to addermarch as well. So addermarch and Maseau really develop as much more independent places in the 1600-1650 time, and then when Cece sweeps west the borderlands are left kinda empty no man’s land


[10/31/2023 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
working on a species reorganization, fyi, on the species-reorg branch. trying to move all the various notes from google docs on different types of creatures in taelgar to obsidian, and also create a bit more clarity on playable species


[10/31/2023 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
easiest to checkout locally and browse in Obsidian, imo, if you care


[10/31/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
I’m in the weeds on hobgoblin troop movements in the 1640s 😀


[10/31/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
hah


[10/31/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
you ok wit River Aure as the canonical name for the river that flows out of Addermarch

[10/31/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that sounds good to me


[10/31/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
It was in some doc of yours with a ?


[10/31/2023 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
do you have any thoughts on kobolds?


[10/31/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
not really


[10/31/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
I've been hesistant to introduce more than orcs and hobgoblins because I feel like an endless proliferation of "bad" non-human races gets confusing


[10/31/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I've used them a bunch as kind of 'not-quite-enemies' in Isaac's campaign, but you all never bit on the investigating kobold raiders in the myrenai gap side quest in the Dunmar campaign


[10/31/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
Which isn't to say they shouldn't exist or anything but I've been cautious about having too much going on at once


[10/31/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
in my game, I mean


[10/31/2023 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
in my typology the only creations of the Void Mind / Three Despairs are orcs and goblinoids, plus undead (Ghesyn, the Soul Eater) and lycanthropes (Jinnik)


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so anything else wouldn't be a strictly evil race IMO


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
right, makes sense


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
I think if there were background lying around in Obsidian on kobolds I might use them somewhere, I just don't have any thoughts on them, per se


[10/31/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
kobolds in my mind were created by dragons in the early days of the world and basically got left behind when the elder wyrms diminished in power during the Long Pause


[10/31/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case if you haven't used them for anything I can add some notes based on how I've introduced them in Isaac's game and my general thoughts


[10/31/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
will probably be pretty thin to start


[10/31/2023 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
Pushed a big update to the 1590s - 1650s in the Sembaran timeline


[10/31/2023 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
how about River Valmont for the river that flows from Addermarch to the Istaros


[10/31/2023 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[10/31/2023 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
this is part of the plaguelands after great war; the forest south of adderfell is the darkwood that is generally considered haunted and dangerous

how about the Marches of Borvina for the last unnamed Sembaran geopolitical unit, the one near the mountains by Ardlas (called WM4 on some maps)


[10/31/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus

[11/1/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
I added a "Primary Sources" folder to dump in-world written documents that are more historical than campaign specific


[11/1/2023 11:32 AM] .deciusmus
I like the species changes, nice org.

One suggestion, maybe move the languages stuff to its own note?

It often comes up as relevant outside the context of creating a character


[11/1/2023 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, I have that in an uncommited change. I just am not sure where to put it so it is lingering in my top-level directory. maybe in species?


[11/1/2023 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
I think species is a good place


[11/1/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
I also wonder if the Character Creation Guide should be under Campaigns.

I don't use the same house rules in my game, for example, as you do. If I ever wanted to include a link to my house rules, I'd rather it be either in my main or in my Campaigns folder


[11/1/2023 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that probably makes sense


[11/1/2023 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
I was starting to make a bunch of "Playing a X" docs which are a bit more ambigious


[11/1/2023 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
as well


[11/1/2023 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
I have so far not diverged from you in the game mechanics of a species


[11/1/2023 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
and am less likely to


[11/1/2023 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
I think those might be good where they are


[11/1/2023 11:37 AM] .deciusmus
Although...

Maybe it would be better to
(a) move the "flavor" bits to the main XXX doc
(b) Make a Species\Rules or Species\Mechanics folder for the game rules


[11/1/2023 11:40 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. in dwarves...

The Playing a Dwarf document has some duplicative introductory material, and the section on Names and Lifespan is maybe better placed in the Dwarves document (or maybe a separate Dwarven Names doc)


[11/1/2023 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
my goal with the "Playing an X" was to allow the main species lore documents to grow fairly large and complex, but still have a place for a quick introduction to the vibe of a species in taelgar


[11/1/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
That does make sense


[11/1/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
My instinct is just to try to disentangle lore and mechanics as much as possible


[11/1/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe a different way of putting it would be that useful lore about a specieis should not be ONLY in the Playing a XX note


[11/1/2023 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, I agree with that


[11/1/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
I guess the main actionable suggestions I'd make would be:

1) Split out life cycle and names to their own docs and/or make sure they are mentioned in the lore somewhere. It is very handy to have an easy place to look for naming of non-humans.

2) Move the Playing a XXX to a Specise\Rules or Species\Mechanics rather than having them under each species. That helps if, for example, I want to publish the species lore to my Taelgarverse site but don't want to include the playing a XX, or alternatively, want to make my own with my own house rules


[11/1/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
(i.e. I could have a Species\Game Rules that I .gitignore and then write my own versions there and publish that instead of the 'main' copy)


[11/1/2023 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
This is all a bit academic, because I am very unlikely to bother as I don't anticipiate running anything in Taelgar that isn't my current group for a long time, and they all have characters and are mostly human


[11/1/2023 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
And if I decide to tweak my one dwarves abilities I'll almost certainly just do it on D&D beyond by making my own homebrew version


[11/1/2023 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
(I assume your inspiration is this idea of a mini-campaign with some new people)

[11/1/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus

I might try a bit of reorg later today


[11/1/2023 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
BTW the folder depth in sembara is kinda annoying. Any objection to making Eastern Green Sea and Western Green Sea top level under Gazetteer?


[11/1/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
nope


[11/1/2023 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
is there a clear reason why we don't sync the stuff in the Campaigns folder? it does not seem like it should conflict, and we both already have rules to ignore certain parts of the folder structure for website building


[11/1/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
no reason


[11/1/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
I'd be happy to sync it


[11/1/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
I am thinking of moving the Playing an X stuff to Campaigns/Mechanics


[11/1/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
that sounds sensible


[11/1/2023 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
you could just leave it unpublished

[11/1/2023 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the species_reorg branch will remove Campaigns from .gitignore, when I'm ready to PR I'll rebase against the updates you've done to main


[11/1/2023 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm also revisiting organization of "Things"


[11/1/2023 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking of putting the "Treasure from XXX" stuff that is basically just a bunch of notes on items you've found in Dunmari Campaign / Treasure


[11/1/2023 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
leaving only Ships, Materials, Books, and Artifacts of Power in Things


[11/1/2023 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
Books and Materials seem very plausible to share across campaigns - no reason you shouldn't have inkaye in your campaign if you want it


[11/1/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
or the elven poet Nelawe in your game as well


[11/1/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus

Maybe western green sea is fine..


[11/1/2023 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
the whole plaguelands / isingue / orenlas / aurbez are a big orphaned

they aren't really green sea oriented but they also aren't "central lowlands" really


[11/1/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
actually looking at my big map of regions I think western green is basically fine


[11/1/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
culturally and historically they are part of the sembaran orbit

I also realized scrolling through that with treasure for dunmar campaign in github repo you can pick which things to look at in the mirror based on which have secrets


[11/1/2023 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
ha


[11/1/2023 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to ask you what the secret was on my old shield that is now gone 😄


[11/1/2023 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
It is definitely Dunmari in design, and the insignia, a stylized head of a rearing horse in front of two crossed spears, dates it to the Dunmari army during the great war. This was probably an officer's shield as the craftsmanship is extraordinary. Alesh thinks it must have been in someone's family for a while, kept and maintained as an heirloom, before [[Agata]] acquired it, as it would not be in this good shape had it been just abandoned somewhere for 200 years. But it could also be something like a trophy [[Agata]] took from someone she killed that she maintained as a form of gloating or remembrance of her victories. Or even something that was lost in a dry, buried location somehow protected from rust and decay


[11/1/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I think actually this is all stuff you learned in game at one point from the smith in Karawa and/or Alesh. or maybe it was stuff I thought you'd ask about


[11/1/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
I will say having all the campaign stuff in git is nice when I do a re-org like rename "River Volta" to "Volta" because it means the links don't break


[11/1/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/1/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
the best secret that needs to be rewritten now with your work on the hobgoblin wars is the Pearl of Power:
"(need to check history with updates from Sembaran guide)
Recovered from the belly of the roper killed in the dwarven outpost near Raven's Hold. This was originally the creation of a wizard of the lands north of Chardon, from before the Great War. It was lost to hobgoblins during the Blood Years, and then traded and stolen among different hobgoblin tribes, until it ended up in the hands of the hobgoblins and allies on the eastern side of the mountains who fought against Sembara in the Hobgoblin Wars in the 1570s. From here, it passed to a series of Sembaran adventurers, mostly priests, until it ended up in the hands of an adventurer killed by wild monsters in the northern part of the Plaguelands. Here is was lost for some time, until in the early 1700s, when it was found again by explorers from the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez, and eventually passed into the hands of a traveling sorcerer in 1742, heading south to explore rumors of evil on the southern mountain border of Aurbez. He found his way to Raven's Hold, where he was trapped, killed, and consumed by the roper."


[11/1/2023 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
Some history is in "History" others in long articles in the Gazetteer


[11/1/2023 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
Does it make sense to keep both? Does one make more sense than the other?


[11/1/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it makes more sense to just link to history in the History directory as needed


[11/1/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
keep gazetteer to relatively current-day stuff


[11/1/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I think some little details like "In 1720, blah blah blah"


[11/1/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
stay in gazettteer


[11/1/2023 3:22 PM] .deciusmus
So for example the long "History" section in Tollen moves to History?


[11/1/2023 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that should move to history I think


[11/1/2023 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
Where would you put something like a 800-1000 word history of the town of Cleenseau?


[11/1/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not sure if embedding notes works for the html conversion. if it does, I'd put that as a note in the history directory and then just embedd the contents in the Cleenseau note


[11/1/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
if note embedding breaks in the html conversion, I'd probably leave short history stuff in the gazettteer and just move stuff out once the history gets past some arbitrary length


[11/1/2023 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly, I find navigating around via links fine, and prefer just linking.


[11/1/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
that's fine too


[11/1/2023 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
I found when writing the Sembaran stuff that dense linking worked best


[11/1/2023 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think we need to have strict rules but in general history should be in history and linked to gazetteer as needed for context


[11/1/2023 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
The "Events" folder is actually really useful when making stuff up


[11/1/2023 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/1/2023 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
someday I'm going to rewrite all the dunmar stuff in timeline + events format


[11/1/2023 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. it is easy to just say:

DR 1592: So and so dies at the [[Battle of Whatever]] 

then create the stub in Events\1592


[11/1/2023 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
Then if I ever wanted to make up details about the battle could just go to the one source for it


[11/1/2023 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
That's the other approach, actually, to something like history.


[11/1/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to start working on the history of CLeenseau soon (which was the whole point of my hobgoblin stuff, but I got distracted)


[11/1/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
And I might try just timeline/events format in the Cleenseau article itself


[11/1/2023 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that could work


[11/1/2023 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I've found that I often care more about the broad sweep of things than a timeilne, so e.g. for Tollen it would be a bit difficult to convert to exclusively a timeline/events format, since what I wanted to capture really was the variable age of parts of the city


[11/1/2023 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
how about historical places? Does Kin-Aska or Avatus or Alcarinque belong in gazetteer


[11/1/2023 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
What I found useful for the Sembaran history was Eras + Overview + Timeline with Events


[11/1/2023 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I moved Drankor to history, I think historical places should go in history as well

👍

[11/1/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Alcarinque probably stays in gazetteer, as I think e.g. Delwath would still say he is from there, and many other elves would as well.


[11/1/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
functionally it might more be "Alcarinque-in-exile" these days but it didn't cease to exist


[11/1/2023 3:37 PM] .deciusmus
Isn't Alcarinque the kingdom that fell before the downfall


[11/1/2023 3:37 PM] .deciusmus
that's what the Obsidian note says


[11/1/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
oh, right, I was thinking of Ainumarya


[11/1/2023 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, Alcarinque is history for sure


[11/1/2023 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
What do you think of this?

[11/1/2023 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
that works really well I think


[11/1/2023 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
easy to add to history when it is contained like that


[11/1/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
where do you think an event should go that spans multiple years?


[11/1/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point we talked about organizing events as century/decade/year/month and putting event notes in the lowest level that made sense


[11/1/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
I have them just by Year/Month with lowest that makes sense


[11/1/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
But I could add more organization


[11/1/2023 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
it might make sense just to add century as a top level organization

[11/1/2023 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
probably won't be too many multiyear events; multiyear events that span centuries can just go in one folder arbitrarily


[11/1/2023 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
I'm making a folder "Ancient" for undifferentiated events that predate drankor

[11/1/2023 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
I moved everything out of Unsorted except the 2 events that have no dates ("Defeat of the Plague Trees" and "The Battle of Shrevandurg")


[11/1/2023 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
So I made an "Unknown" or just leave them in Unsorted?


[11/1/2023 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
put those in 1600s


[11/1/2023 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
they are listed in chronological order in the session notes, and they both come between Exile of the Fraternity of the Empty Moon (1620s) and the Summer of Red Storms (1709)

Sure

I found a Timeline doc and aligned a couple of dates in my Sembara history with it


[11/1/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure about other god stuff - dunmari pantheon, mos numena/eight divines, northern folk religions, kestavo, funerary traditiosn


[11/1/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
feels like there is a lot of religion / gods that might not be well represented in obsidian


[11/1/2023 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/1/2023 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
The kestavo stuff is definitely not copied over


[11/1/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a more extensive language doc that goes into a lot more detail than my note


[11/1/2023 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the religion stuff is the main thing though


[11/1/2023 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
oh also I'm not sure we have all the pre-Downfall human migration stuff in obsidian


[11/1/2023 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a lot of that as well


[11/1/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
a lot of that I'd consider brainstorming


[11/1/2023 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
well things like the ancient mariner culture and its timing/spread through green sea is pretty canonical


[11/1/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
There are various contradictory and background strains of thought but I'm not sure any of it needs to be canonical history


[11/1/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
That's true, there are bits that are


[11/1/2023 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
the stuff about religious history is definitely more brainstorming


[11/1/2023 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
the basic framework of migrations leaving hkar, although not the details, is pretty central to a lot of the human culture stuff


[11/1/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
I guess some of that would be well-placed in Obsidian under Worldbuilding


[11/1/2023 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that is probably a good spot for it


[11/1/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
Do you mind if I push a reorg of Worldbuliding?

I'm creating 3 folders, plus leaving some stuff top-level:

Background: Canonical information that should inform creation, but that doesn't really belong in the main "notes" section (i.e. human migrations from Hkar)
Brainstorming: Dumps from other sources or raw brainstorming, not canonical
Unnamed or Tentative: stubs or short stuff about places that either have a tentative name or no good name, or just need a home and don't have one yet (Pandar, for example)


[11/1/2023 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that's fine. sounds good


[11/1/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
Hkar is a definitive name, any reason not to move that to History?


[11/1/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that should be in history.


[11/1/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
also actually Pandar can be considered definitive I believe. I can't find any mention of it in any forgotten realms wikis


[11/1/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
how about Urlich Monastery


[11/1/2023 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
That is from Ulrich Monastery that was published in an old Dragon magazine adventure, I just switched the l and the r


[11/1/2023 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but honestly I see no reason not to keep the name


[11/1/2023 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
St. Ulrich was/is a real catholic saint so it isn't like the author of the *dungeon magazine article made up the name


[11/1/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I googled Urlich and got lots of hits for "did you mean Ulrich"

Poking around there are a few oddities. Not sure how to fix but for example I moved the main narrative about the northern deno’qai to the Northern Tribes file


[11/1/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
Because nothing links it it didn’t get included


[11/1/2023 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
I guess that specific one is easy by adding something to one of the actual tribes like..
One of the [Northern Tribes] of the Deno’qai


[11/2/2023 9:09 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed an update that adds an "Unlinked Pages" to _MOC that will show pages with no backlinks, to help fine the missing content like the above


[11/2/2023 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
thinking about events on my walk to work. have a bunch of meetings rest of day so probably won't do anything until tonight or the weekend, but curious your thoughts - this is just brainstorming for now


[11/2/2023 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
it seems like there are three kinds of events/time worth tracking: 
1. recurring events like lunar cycle, holidays, new years, even different calendar reckonings or things like PC / important NPC birthdays if anyone ever cares
2. events that happen at a specific point in time, and can be summarized as a specific thing, e.g. "The Great War" or "The Battle Against Wakog"
3. campaign and DM secret timelines, that might go into the future and/or include some boring stuff that isn't really an event (party prepared for pyravela in Tollen)


[11/2/2023 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the stuff in 1 is easy to track via Fantasy Calendar, it just requires a bit of setup, so that seems like the best solution. having festivals and other important recurring dates pop up on fantasy calendar is great for session planning, etc


[11/2/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
the stuff in 2 is easy to do with the Events folder and specific notes for each event, linked as needed to timelines, session notes, gazetteer, history, etc


[11/2/2023 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
the stuff in 3 is the thing I remain unsure about. it is too granular to convert into events easily, but it can get too complicated to track as a bunch of separate timelines


[11/2/2023 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
I don't think we need have a common solution for 3, but in my ideal world there would be a feasible way to query "what happened in march 1748 anywhere in the world" that would pull up both campaign timeline stuff from all campaigns that exist, world timeline stuff / DM secrets, and documented events


[11/2/2023 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
this might have to be e.g. a python script outside Obsidian that can be used to generate notes as desired


[11/2/2023 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if we have a consistent format for timeline notes then a python script could slice and dice them pretty easily


[11/2/2023 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
anyway, something to think about. the shared timeline stuff is my biggest current hurdle with obsidian


[11/2/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, I agree that good timelines and the ability to query dates is something we don't have a great solution for, that would be cool


[11/2/2023 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
For holidays and whatnot, fantasy calendar does work really well, except that it is impossible to put the fantasy calendar info in github, so it is hard to share


[11/2/2023 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
for moment in time events, the fc-date yaml tag works but actually moment in time events I mostly don't want on the fantasy calendar


[11/2/2023 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
I haven't found a good way to make reoccuring events appear nicely on the fantasy calendar, although it should be possible


[11/2/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
For 2, totally agree the events structure works well (and would be easy to add metadata to make queries easier)


[11/2/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
the fc-date yaml works for things that happen every year on the same day


[11/2/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I just added Pyravela and it seems to work fine


[11/2/2023 12:29 PM] .deciusmus
right, the "in calendar UI" doesn't really


[11/2/2023 12:29 PM] .deciusmus
but the fc-date does,  discovered that


[11/2/2023 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
the problem is things keyed off lunar dates, which the plugin can't calculate


[11/2/2023 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus
we should probably routinely add fc-date information to anything keyed off same date each year, that should parse relatively smoothly

{Reactions}
👍

[11/2/2023 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
the online fantasy calendar can do it
https://helpdocs.fantasy-calendar.com/topic/event_conditions/


[11/2/2023 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
but I guess the obsidian version doesn't know how


[11/2/2023 1:22 PM] .deciusmus
honestly if I knew typescript probably would be pretty easy to add


[11/2/2023 1:22 PM] .deciusmus
there's a "get events for day" function that seems to do the filtering


[11/2/2023 1:25 PM] .deciusmus
Esp if everything is either first new moon of month or first full moon of month


[11/2/2023 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
anyway, ignore that for now...
the real issue is how to tag intra-note sections


[11/2/2023 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
so that they could show up in a dataview query or similar


[11/2/2023 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
ok, it is a bit of a pain, but...


[11/2/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
If you
(a) use tasks for bulleted timeline lists by doing:
  ``` - [ ] ``` instead of ``` * ``` to create the list
(b) add a date field to the list:
``` (taelgar-date:: 1719-12-30) ```
(c) add a #events-source tag on the document

Then this:
```dataview
TASK from #timeline where taelgar-date.year = 1719
```

produces:

[11/2/2023 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
the "date" is linked to the file


[11/2/2023 5:10 PM] .deciusmus
the source is either
(a) for files with #timeline tag and no tasks, the front matter of the file
(b) for files with #timeline tag and tasks, the set of tasks

Typing
```- [ ] DR (taelgardate:: 358): [[Emperor Anates]] campaigns around the [[Mostreve Hills]]```

vs
```* DR 360: [[Emperor Anates]] crosses the [[Enst]] and establishes a garrison at [[Cleenseau]]```


[11/2/2023 5:15 PM] .deciusmus

[11/2/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the reading render might be modifiable in css at least


[11/2/2023 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
would require python updates


[11/2/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to go look for CSS examples for fixing the reading render


[11/2/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
I could have the field name by DR


[11/2/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
so you type
- [ ] (DR:: 358)


[11/2/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
the downside in my mind is that you give up a lot of filtering simplicity by using js instead of the dataview queries themselves


[11/2/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
well, it is really easy to do in dataview tables if you don't mind 2 separate lists


[11/2/2023 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
the real fancy thing would be to convert years automatically so you could type DR:: xxxx or CY:: xxxx


[11/2/2023 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
one for embedded one for files

```dataview
TABLE taelgardate as Date from #timeline where taelgardate > date(1700-01-01)
```


[11/2/2023 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
but I couldn't find a way to merge them without JS


[11/2/2023 5:23 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, maybe just using tasks for everything is best


[11/2/2023 5:23 PM] .deciusmus

[11/2/2023 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
```dataview
TABLE tasks.taelgardate as Date, tasks.text as Event from #timeline flatten  file.tasks as tasks where tasks.taelgardate > date(1700-01-01)
```


[11/2/2023 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
The key thing is that using tasks and a consistent date tagging scheme for embedded timeline information is the best option for grabbing information embedded in notes


[11/2/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/2/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it makes sense to use DR as a tag, and CY as a tag


[11/2/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
Perhaps even other calendar schemes


[11/2/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
the other bit I haven't entirely worked out is the easiest way to manage year-only and year-season events


[11/2/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
the date() stuff only works with full dates


[11/2/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
Hmm


[11/2/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, again, in JS you could do:

dv.date(t.DR) == undefined ? t.DR : dv.date(t.DR).year


[11/2/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
to get a consistent year


[11/2/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
Practically speaking I think fast data view queries are probably okay working only on full date stuff


[11/2/2023 5:31 PM] .deciusmus
or you could do:

dv.date(t.DR) == undefined ? dv.date(DateTime.fromISO(t.DR + "-01-01")   : dv.date(t.DR)


[11/2/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
that way, at least, date filters work.
for display you'd want to display something else


[11/2/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
which is back to JS


[11/2/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
The two main use cases are having timeline notes that are static in code but dynamic in what they display, and doing things like “what happened in the past month”


[11/2/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
Even that could be static in code


[11/2/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
Using fantasy calendar current date


[11/2/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
true


[11/2/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Translation to web is going to be a bit complex


[11/2/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
The advantage of JS is you can pull in births/deaths/reign start/etc


[11/2/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
See, I don't think this has that much value on the web


[11/2/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
That might be true


[11/2/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
Are you thinking you want to generate a web-shareable campaign timeilne from session notes?


[11/2/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Probably the reverse - just have a timeline doc but stick some bits of it in relevant session notes


[11/2/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
My current thinking is basically:
(a) create "event" and "timeline" documents as 'primary sources' (i.e. my campaign timeline or the sembara timeline or whatever)
(b) sprinkle timeline events in other places, either via complex JS that uses other frontmatter or just dumping tasks in the top of a note

And then I can, if I am making up history somewhere, get everything that happened in the 50 years across the world, for consistency check and inspiration


[11/2/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
The other use case would be "recent campaign events" where I am doing something similar, but on a campaign timeline, so rather than 50 years, I want 3 months


[11/2/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
But my envisioned use is really around exploration and cross checking, rather than sharing, so I'd be happy with mostly hacking dataviewJS and such


[11/2/2023 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
the consistency check stuff is more important to me than web formatting, so better to design for that


[11/2/2023 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
if things are tagged properly it should always be possible to add python code to generate markdown pages pulling from timeline tags as desired


[11/2/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
if I want to get fancy that is probably the place


[11/2/2023 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
So the main web-format change would be to update the python stuff to change:

- [ ] (DR:: xxx) or - [ ] (CY:: xxx)
to
* DR xxx or * CY xxx


[11/2/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that should be easy enough


[11/2/2023 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i will think a bit. i want to do it in a way that leaves open the possibility of an extension to making nicely formatted markdown timelines to insert / generate for web


[11/2/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
one question is to we want to use other tagging besides date


[11/2/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is a pain to tag individual lines in a file with anything more than date


[11/2/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
it might get a little tedious to have e.g. campaign tags and probably isn't worthwhile


[11/2/2023 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
you can always grab context from the frontmatter of the source file


[11/2/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if you wanted to generate a timeline of everything we did in the dunmar campaign but didn't want to include events from my cleenseau timeline, just change the source from #timeline to something else


[11/2/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it is very common/likely to have a file that has both very-campaign specific events and generic ones


[11/2/2023 5:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah that is probably true


[11/2/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
actually looks like bare years work ok


[11/2/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
no, they dont


[11/2/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
nevermind


[11/2/2023 5:50 PM] rsulfuratus
so to summarize:

* events (whether separate files or tasks) should have a tag, either DR:: or CY:: that indicates date in either Drankorian or Dwarven years
* files to be processed to grab this information need a tag (I would go with #event-source probably because not every file with event information is going to be a #timeline)


[11/2/2023 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
then we can hack together some dataviewjs to generate summaries / unified timelines, and add some processing to the script to reformat - [ ] (DR:: <date>) into - DR: date


[11/2/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/2/2023 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
For multi-year or multi-day events, just use DR: start-date and DR_end: end-date?


[11/2/2023 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is probably fine


[11/2/2023 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
what would use DR-end though?


[11/2/2023 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess good to future proof


[11/2/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
do we care about date format? probably yyyy-mm-dd?


[11/2/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
or yyyy-mm or yyyy


[11/2/2023 6:09 PM] rsulfuratus
and actually I did think of one thing that is very useful to tag - for things that recharge on > long rest (e.g., eudomes mirror, riswynn's divine inspiration) it is incredibly useful to be able to pull up a list of just the events that are tagged "mirror" or "di" or whatever so I can see the last success / use


[11/2/2023 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
but of course those would be optional tags


[11/2/2023 6:23 PM] .deciusmus
Dates have to be yyyy or yyyy-mm or yyyy-mm-dd I believe


[11/2/2023 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
For the date functions to work


[11/2/2023 6:54 PM] rsulfuratus
so messing around a bit, a few things:


[11/2/2023 6:57 PM] rsulfuratus
it looks like you can't have secrets or notes in the tasks (well, you can, but dataview doesn't process them). that is if you have:
%%
- [ ] (DR:: 1748-01-01) secret event
%%
the secret event doesn't look like it will show up


[11/2/2023 6:58 PM] rsulfuratus
the only thing this is a bit annoying for is if I want to, e.g., have chronology sections in NPC notes that will get pulled into a universal timeline, since there may often be secrets in there. there are probably work-arounds, such as just keeping all secret events in a separate file


[11/2/2023 7:00 PM] rsulfuratus
you can do: - [ ] (DR:: 1748-01-01) %%SECRET secret event%%


[11/2/2023 7:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but then it shows up in your query as - [ ] (DR:: 1748-01-01)


[11/2/2023 7:02 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I wonder if the Javascript has the full line somewhere just not in text


[11/2/2023 7:15 PM] rsulfuratus
By definition secrets should never be displayed on website so it might not matter too much - I could just have a secret_events.md doc that isn’t shared


[11/2/2023 7:16 PM] rsulfuratus
Right now I have a handful of (mostly now dead) NPCs with long secret chronologies but there is not a clear reason these need to be in the NPC notes


[11/2/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
Right you could even add a dataview to the npc that pulls in that npc secret events as long as it’s not shared


[11/2/2023 7:46 PM] rsulfuratus
What would be cool is to have a dataviewjs template that adds chronology to an npc using regex to match events that have their name


[11/2/2023 7:47 PM] .deciusmus
You could probably do it with back links


[11/2/2023 7:48 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking the other way around — it would be cool to synthesize events for each npc based on birth/death/whereabouts


[11/2/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
for worldbuilding the birth / death would be useful, especially for royalty and similar. I was thinking for session planning or even during a session, an NPC chronology would be useful to see at a glance


[11/2/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
turns out you CAN use lists


[11/2/2023 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
TABLE tasks.DR as Date, tasks.text as Event from #event-source flatten file.lists as tasks where (tasks.DR > 400) or (tasks.DR.year > 400)


[11/2/2023 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
file.lists instead of file.tasks


[11/2/2023 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
works perfectly


[11/2/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
huh, weird it is not documented?


[11/2/2023 8:12 PM] .deciusmus
not really


[11/2/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
the only place I saw it was the bottom of here:
https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/add-metadata/#inline-fields


[11/2/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
all list items in the file (file.lists and file.tasks)


[11/2/2023 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
when I run that I get the date in the Date and Event


[11/2/2023 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
what is your source data?


[11/2/2023 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
```
- (DR:: 1749-01-08) *(Secret)*: [[Kadmos]] does dastardly things
```


[11/2/2023 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
```
TABLE events.DR as Date, events.text as Event from #event-source  FLATTEN file.lists as events where (events.DR = 1749) or (events.DR.year = 1749)
```


[11/2/2023 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus

[11/2/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[11/2/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/2/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
that is true


[11/2/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
because the "text" includes the whole line


[11/2/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
just get rid of the events.DR as Date bit


[11/2/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I am trying to find a way to suppress fields in the table output, since I actually want to keep date in there to sort on, but then not display it, I know there is a way to do this


[11/2/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
```
LIST WITHOUT ID events.text from #event-source flatten file.lists as events where (events.DR = 1749) or (events.DR.year = 1749)
```


[11/2/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
that works pretty well actually


[11/2/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
```dataviewjs
const yearStart = 0
const yearEnd = 1719

dv.table(["Date", "Event", "File"], dv.pages("#event-source").flatMap(item => {
    if (item.file.lists.length == 0 && item.file.frontmatter.DR != null) {
        return [{year: item.file.frontmatter.DR.year ?? item.file.frontmatter.DR, date: item.file.frontmatter.DR, text: item.file.name, file: item.file.name}];
    } else {
        return item.file.lists.where(t => t.DR != null).map(t => {
            let firstColon = t.text.lastIndexOf(':')
            let realText = firstColon > 0 ? t.text.substring(firstColon+1) : t.text;
            return {year: t.DR.year ?? t.DR, date: t.DR, file: item.file.name, text: realText};
        })
    }    
}).where(f=> (f.year >= yearStart) && (f.year <= yearEnd)).sort(f=>f.date.year ?? f.date).map(f => [f.date, f.text, dv.fileLink(f.file)]))
```


[11/2/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
```
LIST WITHOUT ID events.text from #event-source flatten file.lists as events where ((events.DR = 1749) or (events.DR.year = 1749)) AND contains(events.text, this.file.name) sort events.DR
```


[11/2/2023 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
that's nice


[11/2/2023 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
gets everything for one npc, right?


[11/2/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/2/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't check for links specifically, which on the plus side gets things you forgot to link, but on the minus side doesn't get things that you linked with an alias or other text


[11/2/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
but it won't pick up events in their own files


[11/2/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
it does


[11/2/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
using links wouldn't but the text search works fine


[11/2/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
no, I mean it wouldn't pick up a note that doesn't have a list


[11/2/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that's correct


[11/2/2023 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think you need to use dataviewjs to combined files and lists


[11/2/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/2/2023 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
```dataviewjs
await dv.view("_scripts/view/get_EventsTable", { yearStart: 100,  yearEnd: 1719, pageFilter: "#event-source"} )
```


[11/2/2023 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
ooh that's nice


[11/2/2023 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
can you have multiple page filters


[11/2/2023 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
?


[11/2/2023 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
fine if not


[11/2/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
its a pass through to 
https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/#dvpagessource


[11/2/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
so anything that supports


[11/2/2023 8:58 PM] rsulfuratus
oh perfect


[11/2/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed in case you want to play around


[11/2/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
pageFilter and yearEnd are optional


[11/2/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
if no pageFilter, it uses #event-source


[11/2/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
if no yearEnd it uses yearStart


[11/2/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
sorts by file not by date


[11/2/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[11/2/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
hrm


[11/2/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
mine is sorted by date but I don't think I have >1 task file

[11/2/2023 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i've got great library timeline, mawar timeline, and dunmari frontier timeline and it does file (alphabetical), then date within file


[11/2/2023 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
actually file may not even be sorted at all


[11/2/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
ok, I see


[11/2/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
it sorts by year


[11/2/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
need to tweak that


[11/2/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
it is hard to get the sorting right with the various ways it parses things


[11/2/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
it sorts by year, then within year by file, then within file I guess just the order the tasks are listed?


[11/2/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
pushed a fix


[11/2/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, I was testing with single event file stuff


[11/2/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
not timelines


[11/2/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
but should work now


[11/2/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
I think it still doesn't work with frontmatter (rather than timeline) that isn't a bare year


[11/2/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
works now


[11/2/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
works with bare year frontmatter too


[11/2/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
puts it as the first event of that year


[11/2/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus

[11/2/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah bare frontmatter works


[11/2/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
But if you change to 1748-06 it doesn’t work I don’t think


[11/2/2023 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
obsidian


[11/2/2023 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
obsidian's file properties management messes things up


[11/2/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that this `return [{ year: item.file.frontmatter.DR.year ?? item.file.frontmatter.DR` doesn't work


[11/2/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
if DR is a date, it works fine, but then you can't have bare years in frontmatter (they get auto-converted to YYYY-01-01)


[11/2/2023 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
if DR is a number, it works fine but then you can't have YYYY-MM-DD in frontmatter


[11/2/2023 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the most flexible option is to treat DR as text and handle type conversion in the javascript


[11/2/2023 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
but it might be simpler to just accept the YYYY-01-01


[11/2/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
I wrote a bunch of date handling js code for whereabouts


[11/2/2023 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
And birth/death years


[11/2/2023 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably not bad to handle in JavaScript


[11/2/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
A few other ideas…
Might be cool to grab location.


[11/2/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
Easy on linked notes, harder on timelines


[11/2/2023 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at the whereabouts code the other advantage is we don't have to use earth months if we don't want to


[11/2/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. could generate display date using fantasy calendar api


[11/2/2023 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah probably that’s a lot nicer


[11/2/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
we dont have a standardized tag for location


[11/2/2023 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
I think outside of events it’s not important but for event sources I suggest location:


[11/2/2023 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess what do we use for whereabouts? It’s 2 parts right?


[11/2/2023 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
two parts, freeform text


[11/2/2023 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
its linked if it matches a note, otherwise not


[11/2/2023 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
events are tricker. someone is always born in a specific spot


[11/2/2023 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
but e.g. The Great War is pretty much a worldwide event


[11/2/2023 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
Good point


[11/2/2023 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
That said it might be nice to have things tagged with a high level region which could always be Taelgar


[11/2/2023 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that could work


[11/2/2023 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
That way you can pull it from front matter even for most campaign stuff


[11/2/2023 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Rather than trying to have specific items have a location


[11/2/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
the pageFilter doesn't work with folders, btw, probably having to do with how `"` are passed


[11/3/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
fixing a few bugs in 10 min between meetings. But the page filter does work

pageFilter: "(#event-source or #timeline) and \"Campaigns\""


[11/3/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
```dataviewjs
await dv.view("_scripts/view/get_EventsTable", { yearStart: 1747, yearEnd: 1747, pageFilter: "(#event-source or #timeline) and \"Campaigns\""} )
```


[11/3/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
works fine


[11/3/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
you need to quote the folder name, as per https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/#dvpagessource


[11/3/2023 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
i was using single quotes which didn't work


[11/3/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
working on a bit of elven history, thinking about ka and mela and leya. which do you like better:
1) during the first 30 years of each ka, at the beginning of mela, every elf who has not experienced a mela before is fertile and able to have children via a mystical process associated with the firstborn; once you have lived through a mela cycle, you are never again able to have children.
2) elves are fertile between roughly 150-180 years, and then cease to be fertile. so it is less mystical and more biological, and what matters is your age not your life experience


[11/3/2023 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
(1) is a little simpler for the first generation / getting things going, and ensures you don't get age drift where if the youngest have kids with youngest and oldest with oldest you tend to move towards overlapping generations over time. it also raises the possibility that Delwath didn't actually experience the last mela during the 37th ka


[11/3/2023 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) is maybe a little more straightforward and clear from the point of view of an elf PC as you can kind of figure out your age and where you fit


[11/3/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I went back and forth on this a lot when I was making up the mela and leya stuff


[11/3/2023 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm leaning towards 1 but not committed to it


[11/3/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I was mostly thinking about in turns of (2), both because
(a) I've largely been playing Delwath as someone who knows he can't have kids because he has missed his chance
(b) I didn't think of any other ideas

But the generation drift was a bit annoying, and you do by math potentially end up with drift. I was thinking of dealing with that via cultural ideas about mostly everyone has children in the first couple of years of coming back from mela, and also everyone of a ka leaves at the same time.

So even with some age variabilty, it would be unusual to have gen drift because someone who is born very early in the ka enters the marriage market so to speak at the same time as everyone else


[11/3/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
That said, adding more mysticism is not necessarily wrong or a bad idea. I'd just have to think about the impact on Delwath. I haven't done the generation math but I assume he would not have experienced a mela yet


[11/3/2023 1:15 PM] rsulfuratus
whether that counts could be clear or unclear depending on how you feel, I guess
he wouldn't have experienced a mela on the material plane. but would have while trapped in the shadow realm


[11/3/2023 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I would expect that elves on the feywild for example would still experience the mela whether they were in the feywild or not


[11/3/2023 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
What about this...

The mela and leya are not time periods or events in the lifecycle of an individual elf, the are actual metaphysical events in the world. Every 80 years, since the first elves were born, Aldanor exhales -- the leya -- and the inhales -- the mela.  (The metaphor is just an example, something plant-related might be better).

An individual elf -- wherever they are -- feels these in their bones. The first leya of an elf's life is said to breath Aldanor's spirit into the elf, and makes them 'adult'. This is often accompanied by an urge to travel or see some new part of the world, and the eighty years after the leya have come to be called by the name of the event.

The first mela, on the other hand, pulls an elf home, and is accompanied by an urge to reconnect with Aldanor. The mela itself lasts for some amount of time - 5 years? 10 years? - as a long inhale basically.

Elves who "reconnect with Aldanor" during that mela become fertile


[11/3/2023 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that a lot


[11/3/2023 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
It could be somewhat unknown what happens to elves who don't return during the mela


[11/3/2023 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
again, the metaphor and vibes might need to be a little different


[11/3/2023 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
And for Delwath specifically, he *didn't* feel the pulse of the mela while in the Shadowfell


[11/3/2023 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Is that because it was too faint, and he was too lost in his pain to notice it and he missed it? Is it because it didn't reach him? In the next mela (when is that, anyway?) will he feel like?


[11/3/2023 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
There is likely also something that could be done with this idea and death, i.e. maybe the pulse of Aldanor gets weaker over time, and elves tend to die off around the mela, as they fail to feel it at all


[11/3/2023 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
Or maybe not


[11/3/2023 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
But a normal elf in the Feywild would obviously feel the mela, so the fact that Delwath didn't hear it would be interesting, but also if the metaphysics were such that he should have heard it, it could be just because he was too wrapped up in his pain to notice


[11/3/2023 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
Or it could be a cool unique feature of the Cha'mutte pocket dimensions. Actually Cha'mutte having a pocket dimension where the embodied gods can't reach would be plauisble


[11/3/2023 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
next mela starts in 1787, so ~40 years


[11/3/2023 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
currently in the 37th leya, which started in 1707


[11/3/2023 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
actually works out to be a convenient time to run games for elf players


[11/3/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/3/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
I also feel like the metaphor should maybe be plant related, or alternatively somehow the mela (or leya) is Aldanor and the other is Elmerca


[11/3/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
I think mela is Aldanor, the leya is Elmerca


[11/3/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
I don't love inhale / exhale as the metaphor. Just was using it as a quick example of what I meant


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
But actually having one for each god works well


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd make the metaphor more root related somehow, like a grounding in the earth


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
then leya is disperal on the wind


[11/3/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, that's perfect


[11/3/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually really like the idea that with each mela elves feel less and less connected to taelgar - works with the root metaphor too


[11/3/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
This also works with my original elf notes about the "rite of awakening" and the "rite of return"


[11/3/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/3/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
The mela is the rite of awakening, the leya is the rite of return


[11/3/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
I think by your 5th or 6th mela most elves don't feel the pull of taelgar anymore, and in the 6th leya is when lots of elves leave


[11/3/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
some in the 5th, some in the 7th, but the peak of departures is the 6th leya


[11/3/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
basically you have 1 leya as a wanderer, 1 as a nuturer, 1 as a caretaker, 1 as an elder/unifier, 1 as an ancient, and then you go


[11/3/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
puts typical lifespan right aroun 1000 years, but really once you reach elder many are forgetting and starting to turn inward


[11/3/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
and then those who stay do so for a reason


[11/3/2023 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
right that seems perfec


[11/3/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that puts the sort of typical elven memory threshold around 400 years:
- you don't remember much from your first mela
- your first leya (80 years) you are out in the word
- next two ka (320 years) you are alternating between caretarker and nuturer
- then you reach your 5th mela and the pull starts to fade. maybe you become a unifier and turn inward, stick around as an elder, etc, but the past starts to feel more like a dream, etc for most elves

I assume you will put some of this in obsidian


[11/3/2023 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus

[11/3/2023 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm working on the history of the elves. got my covid + flu shots yesterday and was feeling pretty crappy this morning so took a sick day and a nap


[11/3/2023 2:08 PM] rsulfuratus
now working on taelgar instead of trying to squeeze something into the end of the day

👍

[11/3/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I pushed a note that has all the elven generations going back to the 1st ka with the mela and leya start years fyi, under elves


[11/3/2023 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
updated elven generations note with text based on this, feel free to edit


[11/3/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking about this some more, the idea that it is liternally Aldanor's influence that lets elves reproduce puts Cha'mutte's desire to kill all the gods in a different light


[11/3/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
no wonder the elves were so against him


[11/3/2023 3:22 PM] .deciusmus
That actually fits perfectly. He is going to kill the elves as a sacrifice to free the other races


[11/3/2023 3:25 PM] .deciusmus
Ok, I'm about to push a getEventsTable update with more flexibility


[11/3/2023 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
```dataviewjs
await dv.view("_scripts/view/get_EventsTable", { 
yearStart: 1512, 
yearEnd: 1512, 
pageFilter: "#test1", 
header : ["Date", "File"],
map : (f => [f.date, dv.fileLink(f.file)])
})
```


[11/3/2023 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
year and page are the same as before


[11/3/2023 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
header, if specified is an array that defines the table header


[11/3/2023 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
map, if specified, is a function that maps from the "event structure" to your table columns


[11/3/2023 3:27 PM] .deciusmus
For now, an event structure defines the following properties:

*  year (the numeric year)
* date (the fantasy-calendar formatted display date, or DR xxx if there is no month or day)
* file (the file itself, for linking)
* text (the text of the event)


[11/3/2023 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
* rawText (the text without stripping the (DR:: )


[11/3/2023 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
Default header if Date, Text, File


[11/3/2023 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
But I am wondering if the default should be date, text only with the date linked to the file


[11/3/2023 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd leave file in


[11/3/2023 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
its not perfect when you intermix different types of dates

it looks like the tag is not correctly stripped from everything?

the master list of everything with every NPC takes a bit to load but is fun to browse


[11/3/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
did you push that yet? i don't see any whereabouts code in the versin I have


[11/3/2023 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
2 seconds ago


[11/3/2023 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
to get the autolink of The Side Quests to the right file you need to add 
   "partyFile" : "The Dunmar Fellowship",
to metadata.json


[11/3/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
I did that for DuFr but not other campaigns


[11/3/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
I don't remember if metadata.json is shared, anyway


[11/3/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
```dataviewjs
await dv.view("_scripts/view/get_EventsTable", {  
yearStart: 1,  
yearEnd: 2000,  
pageFilter: "\"People/Chardonians/Kaeso\"", 
includeAll : true
})
```


[11/3/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
the "includeAll" is key, it includes all synthenized events


[11/3/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
if you want only some synthenized events, I support:

```   includeBirth
        includeDeath
        includeRegnal
        includeExcursions
        includePartyMeetings


[11/3/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
There  is a little bit of messiness around the recent PCs who have full date whereabouts but year-only birth and death dates.

The birth dates are fine, but like Arcus doesn't look great:


[11/3/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
weird bug - it parses both 11 and 12 as december

[11/3/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
also that date is wrong


[11/3/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that probably came from a bug in the regen template which I believe (probably wrongly) uses the current date for an exucrsion when there is no date


[11/3/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
so if you converted from the old-style location/home stuff to the new style whereabouts stuff when the fantasy calendar date was 11-23-1748 the header gen code set the excursion date as 11-23-1748


[11/3/2023 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is probably the issue


[11/3/2023 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
arcus has quite a lot of timeline entries and mentions for someone who has been dead (ish) since before the campaign started


[11/3/2023 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure it is actually worthwhile trying to overload whereabouts, e.g. for arcus I have the whole timeline of his journey from chardon to songara to tokra to karawa to the forst


[11/3/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
*fort


[11/3/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
whereabouts is mostly useful when you want to know where someone is at a time, not for narrative timelines


[11/3/2023 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
javascript dates are the worst invention ever


[11/3/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
setYear() then setMonth() then setDate() does some weird craziness


[11/3/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
setDate() setMonth() setYear() seems to work


[11/3/2023 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
pused a regex fix


[11/3/2023 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
I puhed a date fix


[11/3/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to play Zelda with Z for a bit. But I think for whereabouts it is probably NOT worth using it. I intentionally made it so that the list items on a page can merge with the whereabouts


[11/3/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
So for most NPCs, I expect that they'd just have a born or born and died. For someone like Arcus, if you wanted to move his whole timeline into his doc, just use a list, then the "arcus timeline" via the events table will merge


[11/3/2023 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense


[11/3/2023 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
For npcs where you either want to track there movement’s specifically outside of “events” (Ie Sura or Havdar) whereabouts is perfect


[11/3/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Although honestly it would probably be ideal if you could have secret whereabouts so that you could track more complex movements.


[11/3/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
although actually with the event stuff I’m not sure if the whole whereabouts thing is even worthwhile as opposed to just having bulleted events


[11/3/2023 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. for secret stuff events are so much better, because I can just have a secret doc


[11/3/2023 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
whereabouts are good for a very small number of people (Vista, for example, or Archivist Lyra) who move between campaigns


[11/3/2023 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
and for tracking things like "born in X, moved to Y as a kid, now lives in Z"


[11/3/2023 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but they are really tedious for keeping track of actual movements during a campaign, which really are best as secret events


[11/3/2023 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah makes sense


[11/3/2023 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
Btw I just pushed a narrative history of Cleenseau to the background folder. Curious as to any thoughts you might have


[11/3/2023 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
If you feel like reading it at some point


[11/4/2023 9:13 AM] rsulfuratus
looking at your Cleenseau doc - making me think I probably need to try to sketch out a definitive history of the Great War based on what I can remember / find of actual campaign history from the 90s, plus some retcons inventions as needed. a key question is did the hobgoblin army that sacked insigue (nee irebor) reach sembara, and if so how deep did they penetrate?


[11/4/2023 9:14 AM] .deciusmus
My dim recollection from high school was that Sembara was a "base of operations" that never was heavily invaded


[11/4/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that was my thinking as well - I seem to recall a race basically to kill cha'mutte before he could ~do something mysterious~ to knock out the sembaran army


[11/4/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
there was a war council and i have a bunch of notes somewhere with troop strengths basically for the southern sembaran army

[11/4/2023 9:20 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that is why you and cha'mutte were in urlich in the first place


[11/4/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
i think looking back at what notes I can easily the intetion was that cha'mutte created the plague to cut dunmar off from sembara, but then on his death is spread somewhat and destroyed the hobgoblin army that had sacked isingue and was threatened sembara's southern borders.


[11/4/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
there was also a whole thing about the lich king of Vasa (now Vostok) that seems like it should just mostly be tossed


[11/4/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
one other thing about hobgoblins - while I think in context it makes sense that they would have put the people of Cleenseau to death given the strategic location as a beachhead, I think of hobgoblins more as authoritarian dictators and slavers than just mindless brutality, and also having enough strategic foresight to balance a reputation for brutality. for example perhap they slaughter anyone who resists, but towns that surrender are taxed, and perhaps some are enslaved, but allowed to escape with relatively little death. and also I guess for hobgoblins taxes and enslavement might not be far off - maybe it is something like they believe that humans naturally owe hobgoblins the products of their labor, so when they govern a place they order people what to do and take what they need of the product. and there is no freedom of movement, or anything. but this isn't chattel slavery, particularly. and of course they recognize that people need food to live and productivity is lower if the population is starving/cold, so living under hobgoblin rule is usually grueling and unpleasant, but not particularly deadly as long as you follow the rules and do what you're told


[11/4/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
Right. One of the reasons I sent it to you is I don’t have a good sense of hobgoblins other than hobgoblins = fascists and orcs = crazed warmongers


[11/4/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
any thoughts on hobgoblins vs halflings?


[11/4/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
Meaning would hobgoblinsnhave any different attitudes towards@other non human races


[11/4/2023 9:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i think that might depend a bit on the group


[11/4/2023 9:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't have a clear sense


[11/4/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the central idea for hobgoblins is they have like the opposite of the divine spark, they see human/incorporeal gods as weak crutches and humans as less-than-sentient for relying on them


[11/4/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
so there is a reason for a particular antipathy to humans


[11/4/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
but of course cha'mutte had a big influence on many hobgoblins and that would probably lead them to lumping nonhumans together


[11/4/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
with humans


[11/4/2023 9:59 AM] .deciusmus
Right. I might tweak the Atavus period history a bit. Actually Atavus was explicitly not allied with Cha’mutte, right?


[11/4/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
correct


[11/4/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe Atavus doesn’t sack the town at all and the halfling community especially has an uneasy truce with him.


[11/4/2023 10:01 AM] .deciusmus
That works to make the current Crossroads Inn a very old building that survived. Maybe it was a center of “Underground Railroad” type activities where the halflings were secretly helping humans escape


[11/4/2023 10:02 AM] .deciusmus
Which is useful for my game as it would explain why there are ancient underground tunnels


[11/4/2023 10:02 AM] rsulfuratus
that definitely would work


[11/4/2023 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus
in my notes Revaka - the hobgoblin in the mirror who was trapped by Cha'mutte for refusing to join his armies - was the granddaughter of the court magician for Atavus


[11/4/2023 10:03 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/4/2023 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus
so Cha'mutte wasn't super-active during Domain of Atavus anyway, or at least was not active enough that he was punishing hobgoblins who didn't join his side


[11/4/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/4/2023 10:05 AM] rsulfuratus
but it would be quite interesting to make the hobgoblin survivors of the domain of atavus carry with them anti-cha'mutte attitudes (presumably hobgoblins were aware of him even that far back)


[11/4/2023 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
So basically you have:
- Atavus, wants to conquer, enslaved the town


[11/4/2023 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
Next relevant set of hobgoblins is the 2nd hobgoblin war, which is the more “peaceful” shattered ice clan folks. They want land to live in more than anything


[11/4/2023 10:07 AM] .deciusmus
And so Cleenseau is fortified but never in real danger of distraction


[11/4/2023 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
But the 3rd hobgoblin war is caused by a new leader amongst the shattered ice hobgoblins who explicitly is seeking bad things for humans - more Naziesque as opposed to Mussolini, say


[11/4/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
And so when Cleenseau is sacked they put some larger percentage of the humans to death, but keep the buildings


[11/4/2023 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
in your hobgoblin war notes, you have the 3rd hobgoblin war started by sembara, but I actually think it makes more sense if it is started by a new hobgoblin leader


[11/4/2023 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus
DR 1644, summer: [[Charlotte II]] at the urging of her husband [[Lionel Falconhurst]], the grandson of the Duke of Maseau, and a prominent [[Isingue|Isinguen]], launches a rapid assault on the [[Shattered Ice Clan]], starting the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|Third Hobgoblin War]]


[11/4/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
Right. Maybe change that


[11/4/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
Or alternatively keep it half-way. The new hobgoblin leader is starting the war against maseau not sembara


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that could work too


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] .deciusmus
And sembara comes to their aid


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
either way I think a new hobgoblin leader with much more explicitly elliminationist aims is a useful component of the beginning of the 3rd war


[11/4/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
which is also much more brutal on cleensau for that reason, which works for your history


[11/4/2023 10:12 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps something to do with the mad scientist hobgoblin politics as well— something that makes shattered ice less concerned with keeping Maseau as a buffer


[11/4/2023 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus
right this is all going to tie into the final tier 4 arc of the dunmari campaign somehow with beryl, the awakened monks, the isingue ooze, and the mad scientist hobgoblins


[11/4/2023 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus
so leave that blank for now, just "something changed"


[11/4/2023 10:13 AM] .deciusmus
And then when sembara comes into the war, and wins at first, the leader is enraged and decides to take on sembara as a first priority


[11/4/2023 10:14 AM] .deciusmus
So you have some degree of “self inflicted” but also some degree of “if not for sembara Maseau would probably be gone”


[11/4/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
right also sembaran army >> massau army, maybe the hope was sembara wouldn't risk another war and it was a bit of a surprise to the hobgoblins that they attacked, and they had to change their battle strategy quickly


[11/4/2023 10:15 AM] .deciusmus
Right. But the new somewhat crazy leader is a wizard or brilliant strategist or has access to a powerful artificat and so he wins and wins against sembara


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
i think for ~reasons~ sembara should never really know why he is winning so much


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
Actually magic could be key here— I have in my notes that the Tyrwinghan warlock army holds them back more successfully than the more mundane sembaran army


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
That works too


[11/4/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
But I need some reason why Cece is so successful against him


[11/4/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, that could be vague as well I guess 😀


[11/4/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
let me look at the timeline a bit, i have a few ideas


[11/4/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
this is all in the 1640s right


[11/4/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
?


[11/4/2023 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/4/2023 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
If it works for you, how about: at some point in the war, Cece just starts winning battle after battle. The hobgoblins fight just as hard, and their tactics are sound, but they keep catching unlucky breaks, and stop catching lucky breaks. So for example maybe in the first battle a convenient lingering fog let’s the hobgoblins hide their calvary, but in the same circumstances later in the war the fog would blow away and clear two hours too early leaving them exposed


[11/4/2023 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
Just pushed a minor update to clarifiy the above, i.e. that the war started against Maseau in 1644 and then after some early Sembaran successes, the Shattered Ice Clan changed direction to fight against the Sembarans


[11/4/2023 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
The sembarans of course attribute this to divine favor, with maybe a little bit of “ethlenn is helping”


[11/4/2023 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
But really no one knows for sure


[11/4/2023 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
What I have established but what doesn't have to be canon is that the hobgoblins rapidly push north, and each summer another set of fortifications falls, in 1645, 1646, and 1647. Then in the winter 1647-1648 the old queen (Charlotte II) is killed in an ambush when visiting troops and Cece is crowned


[11/4/2023 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
I'm agnostic as to whether Cece has a few early stalemates, but the flavor I have written is that in the summer campaign seaso nof 1648 she just starts winning, and winning


[11/4/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
It works perfectly with the history for it to be seen in Sembara as just divine favor. I could even make Cece explicitly thought to the blessed by the Mother or something. She could plausibly have divine magic to some extent even


[11/4/2023 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
I would say she has a few statements in spring that are basically forgotten about now, and then in the summer begins a winning streak driven by exceptional bad luck on the part of the hobgoblin armies, and assumed in sembara to be cece’s divine blessing


[11/4/2023 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
Works perfectly


[11/4/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
The other bit I have is that the Tyrwinghan army, in alliance with the Earl of Addermarch, is much more successful at holding the line against the hobgoblins than Sembara. This could very plauisbily just be because the hobgoblin leader sees it as their mission to kill the sembarans specifically to punish them in meddling with his war against Maseau


[11/4/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
But there could also be a fey/warlock side


[11/4/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
I can leave it undefined


[11/4/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I think that’s fine, combination of factors can make that work.


[11/4/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
Here's what I'm adding:

Enst Campaign
---
DR: 1648
tags: [event-source]
---
A series of battles between [[Sembara]] and the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] that pushed the hobgoblins south of the [[Enst]]. Characterized by exceptionally bad luck on the part of the hobgoblins, which is attributed in Sembara to Cece's personal connection to the [[The Father]]


[11/4/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
DR 1648, late winter: Charlotte II is [[The Ambush of Charlotte II|killed by hobgoblins]] while travelling to inspect the [[Army of the South]] camped outside [[Wisford]]
* DR 1648, late winter: Cece I crowned Queen
* DR 1648, early spring: The [[Army of the North]] attempts to break the [[Siege of Dunfry (Third Hobgoblin War)|siege of Dunfry]], and is bogged down
* DR 1648, late spring: Cece I combines the Armies of the South, and Mostreve, and raises a special levy across the realm, and forms the [[Radiant Alliance]], which she takes personal command of
* DR 1648, early summer: After a few stalemates, the [[Radiant Alliance]] breaks the siege of  Dunfry and the Armies of the North and West join with the Radiant Alliance
* DR 1648, summer:  [[The Enst Campaign]] pushes the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] west of [[Barony of Vaubonne|Vaubonne]] and south of the [[Enst]]


[11/4/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that is great


[11/4/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
Even the name works for Semabara to treat this as divine favor


[11/4/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
(Radiant Alliance)


[11/4/2023 10:39 AM] .deciusmus
yeah. all that is pushed


[11/4/2023 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I also pushed some notes copied from various word docs I have in onedrive from the high school game under Worldbuilding\High School Notes

[11/4/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
Would it be implausible for Avatus to have constructed a permanent dimension door that would teleport people from the old Drankorian fort on the south bank of the Enst to a small underground fortification on the north bank?


[11/4/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
That could still exist, perhaps?


[11/4/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
That seems totally plausible. His court wizard made the mirror of soul trapping after all


[11/4/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
True


[11/4/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
Mostly just looking for ways to expand the dungeon 😄


[11/4/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
But I'm thinking that's how he broke the Sembaran line. Although Sembara was a bit disorganized at the time, holding the line of the Enst would have been important, and crossing the fortified bridge relatively hard. Avatus sent a crack team of hobgoblin adventures across the river under the cover of invisibility/etc and then constructed -- a little bit away from the main town -- a small underground area, with a dimension door back to the south bank where Avatus had taken over the old drankroian fort. From the underground base, the hobgoblins constructed various ways to attack behind the lines, thus defeating the army in a surprise midnight attack


[11/4/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
which today, plays out as some mostly ruined tunnel from under the town leading to a large underground staging area with a portal back to the lair of Avatus, which is mostly ruined, but might still have a few weird things hanging around

[11/5/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking more about elven society, trying to get a vision of orenlas. here is kind of my framework, but interested in your perspective if anything seems "un-elvish" to you.


[11/5/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
1. synthesizing the email discussion about material abundance, intellectual property, what elves see as wealth, etc. 

the basic framework is that elves are capable, via magic, of growing nearly anything, but this is not necessarily simple or easy in all cases. growing enough food and providing simple clothes, space to live, basic necessities, for all elves is the first priority, and except when under attack or otherwise disrupted from the normal balance of things, this is always possible and a fundamental aspect of elven civilization. there is no poverty in elven cities

that said, this does not mean there are no differences in wealth. while elves find no reason to accumulate coin or gems in their raw form, they do value new things that are brought into the world, whether ideas/songs/stories/poems or physical things of beauty, or of practical value (although I think elven culture would usually tend towards beauty). building on the idea from the sisila tree fruit backstory from Delwath, one thing that determines wealth is that it is a privilege to be allowed to use rare materials. so you can't buy sisila fruit with money, but if you are recognized as a talented chef you are given one to bake with. 

exactly how this kind of resource allocation is managed in elven society can be handwaved a bit, but the key vibes aspect is that there are wealthy/non-wealthy elves in some sense, but wealth is measured in what you create. so a "poor" jeweler may often work with plain metals, and a "rich" jeweler may have the opportunity to craft in mithril. but there is also a "how far have your creations spread" aspect, and this is how you "get rich" - a "poor" jeweler who produces amazing designs in bronze and copper may get asked to make something with gold or mithral. 

this ties in to intellectual property too, as derivative work is less valued that new work


[11/5/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the details of this are a bit unnecessary to really know, but the implications in game would be:
1. elves would sometimes trade for material goods, as material abundance does not necessarily mean lack of scarcity entirely - but they wouldn't *need* to do it
2. you still have a kind of status hierarchy based around perceived value of the new things you bring into the world. as a side note, this sets up a bit of dichotomy where "creators" are higher status than "doers". So Delwath, as a solider and quartermaster, would not necessarily be seen as a high status elf (although perhaps this is also a consequence of the great war - in the absence of war perhaps he would have been an amazing chef). i'm not sure this is exactly right, so maybe there is kind of a second, orthogonal hierarchy that is more oriented around caretaker roles, so you can be high status because you are a skilled commander or a talented wizard and not necessarily need to create something new
3. elven cities would feel weird to other races - there aren't markets in the usual sense, people aren't really buying food. there would be trees with fruit just kind of there, for example. maybe there would be occasional art shows, and lots of songs and storytelling, and things like that that would have subtle undercurrents of competition noticeably primarily to other elves


[11/5/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
2. on governance and society

the basic idea here I think is a bit more established, around the nurturer/caretaker distinction, the unifiers and the "trial of unity" idea, and the idea of each ka as kind of a collective unit that figures out how to reach consensus on their own

the game implications are, I think:
1. you can't go to an elven city and say "take me to your leader" - there is no galadriel or elrond to speak to. however, I think that most elven settlements would have some people who are the outerward face of the community to visitors. perhaps with explicit titles like "Caretaker So-and-So". 
2. if you are asking something of "elves" it should be a little unclear how decisions are made, although there is an opportunity to create a way to participate in a "trial by unity" if desired
3. there should probably not be a lot of internal, obvious factions in elvish society, except during times of debate and consensus-finding, and then those factions would be temporary. this is probably not a universal rule - decision points have to start somewhere and may start with a factional period. but once it is resolved, it is resolved.


[11/5/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
adding this to worldbuilding/brainstorming as well


[11/5/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
I like all this


[11/5/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
A few other thoughts — I think a lot of this — especially the creator stuff — would move on scales that make it hard for humans to observe. There is probably rarely a rush and a lot of time spent contemplating and so on


[11/5/2023 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
So for example an elven poetry recital might seem odd to a human in a couple of ways— it might take a couple of days rather than a night, and reactions might be considered and take a week or two or more to come out


[11/5/2023 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure.. thinking a bit


[11/5/2023 6:59 PM] .deciusmus
So… forget the above. I think it isn’t interesting. I think you have it about right, but I’d make one tweak.


[11/5/2023 7:08 PM] .deciusmus
Basically here’s my view of the PCs arriving in an elf city and attending a banquet.  

Unlike in a human city, where the banquet would be put on by some lord/baron/whatever, in the elven city it is probably put on by someone the community values highly. A creator of some sort. 

Maybe in this case a famous chef is throwing a banquet to celebrate a rare nectar that is aged for 3 ka and is being unveiled. 

Who attends? It isn’t the “rich” as that isn’t entirely meaningful. Perhaps the chef invites a poet, who has agreed to present a new poem in the chef’s honor. A jewel smith is also in attendance in exchange for a delicate ring, which is presented as a gift to the chef before the meal (so everyone can admire the jewel smith). Of course some of the chefs friends are there as well, perhaps without any particular gifts.


[11/5/2023 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
But I’m not sure it would feel like a status competition exactly


[11/5/2023 7:10 PM] .deciusmus
How did the chef get the rare nectar to begin with? Probably via a consensus process more than anything else. The rare materials go to those who can make the best use of them


[11/5/2023 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
Or rather can create the best thing with them


[11/5/2023 7:12 PM] .deciusmus
And of course, plenty of elves are “middle class” and wouldn’t have any great talents - and would rarely if ever attend such fancy banquets


[11/5/2023 7:14 PM] .deciusmus
But I think an outsider would see it all as glittering and amazing and impressive - an “fancy” elven banquet would be filled with the best creators


[11/5/2023 7:21 PM] .deciusmus
As far as status, it’s perfectly normal for government agents or even generals to be middling rather than high status… and given there is no low status or poverty why would a commander necessarily be high status?


[11/5/2023 7:22 PM] .deciusmus
Now, gratitude is a real thing and a famous solider who was known to say have saved a bunch of elves would certainly have an “in”


[11/5/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
right, this is what I was getting at with "orthogonal hierarchy"


[11/5/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't the same as being rich, in a sense, but there are many ways to being respected


[11/5/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I just don’t think elven society is particularly status conscious


[11/5/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
true


[11/5/2023 7:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but in your banquet example, perhaps the famous solider is also there - not because they are necessarily friends with the chef, or have anything valuable to present to demonstrate their creative prowess, but simply as a gesture of gratitude and acknowledgement


[11/5/2023 7:26 PM] .deciusmus
I do think there are glittering banquets and famous painters who having a portrait from them is something a bunch of elves want. But then other elves maybe are more interested in listening to Aldanors roots and spend years “not doing much” as far as humans would see it


[11/5/2023 7:26 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense


[11/5/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
I do think the more material focused elves who be the ones “outsiders” see more. It’s easier to observe the unveiling of a famous painting or a jeweler presenting an orate set of earrings


[11/5/2023 7:27 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/5/2023 7:30 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway I think your vibe is basically right, the main comment I really had is that I’m not sure elves are particularly obsessed with status. So I think the poetry reading would be more about being good and honoring the material and bringing something new into the world, and less about one-upping another elf


[11/5/2023 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that makes sens


[11/5/2023 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
*sense


[11/5/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
Of course if a famous goldsmith was in attendance and one of the poets particularly wanted a new set of golden candlesticks, then the poet might be trying to impress the goldsmith


[11/5/2023 7:32 PM] .deciusmus
And an aspiring goldsmith needs to impress the community to be seen as “worthy” of working in a scare resource (gold)


[11/5/2023 7:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess one thing to think about is who is collecting all this art - some of it is maybe made for the artist, or for the community, but is any art collected? is it only by other artists?


[11/5/2023 7:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess this is in part what I was thinking about w/r/t other hierarchies of status - does a famous diplomat or solider or other kind of hero/adventurer come home and end up with wealth in the form of gifts?


[11/5/2023 7:36 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, probably.


[11/5/2023 7:37 PM] .deciusmus
And I think even a “middle-class” elf would have some art. After all, to gain a name for yourself you’d want to give away some works


[11/5/2023 7:40 PM] .deciusmus
And also, beauty is I think important to elven culture


[11/5/2023 7:41 PM] .deciusmus
But also it isn’t obvious they would want it. Maybe gardens are their thing not art. Or song, and they are honored by having some songs dedicated to them


[11/5/2023 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, of course


[11/5/2023 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
on a separate topic, looking at the timing of leya and mela, I think it probably needs to be the case that these aren


[11/5/2023 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
*aren't hard and fast dates, but rather have some flexibility


[11/5/2023 7:43 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., right now the leya of the 36th ka starts in 1547, two years after the great war begins


[11/5/2023 7:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but it makes a lot more sense for that generation to have been "rushed" and underwent the Rite of Awakened 10 years early


[11/5/2023 7:44 PM] .deciusmus
Right, well, ultimately it’s literally something Aldanor and Elmerca are doing


[11/5/2023 7:45 PM] .deciusmus
So they could have changed the timing


[11/5/2023 7:47 PM] .deciusmus
But I don’t think elves themselves can change it. Although I think the leya isn’t actually physiologically as important as the mela.


[11/5/2023 7:47 PM] rsulfuratus
the way I've been thinking about it in sketching out history is the following:
1. the mela starts every 160 years, like clockwork. the rooting of aldanor grows stronger in the few years before the mela begins, and by the beginning of the mela elves are feeling the pull of Aldanor's roots and their connection to Taelgar. sometimes this lasts 10 years, sometimes 20.
2. elven childhood, the time of dreaming, is usually 50 years, but sometimes it is 35, and sometimes 60. the leya is traditionally marked as when the first elven children begin to experience the Rite of Awakening
3. the first few years of the leya often have a gradual pace of awakening, but sometimes everyone awakens all at once. Elmerca, who controls prophecy and foresight, also controls the timing of the leya and can shift the dreams of the sleepers as needed


[11/5/2023 7:48 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I like that


[11/5/2023 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
the advantage of this is for worldbuilding is that we don't have to constantly adjust the dates of each ka, which are counted from the start of the mela, but have flexibilty for the role of the elves in the world by shifting the leya


[11/5/2023 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
so the leya dates in the cycle of generations doc could be shifted by 15 years or so in either direction, but the mela dates shouldn't change


[11/5/2023 7:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right. That makes sense. I also think each individual elf has a different length of time in the dreaming. Because kids are born over say a 15-20 year span, but the awakening is more of a 2-3 year span


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
The older kids just spend longer in the dreaming.


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
Elves probably find the idea of counting age a bit odd anyway. It would be meaningless to Delwath to say he is 263 years old or whatever.


[11/5/2023 7:50 PM] .deciusmus
(Which I think kind fits how I’ve been playing him anyway)


[11/5/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
putting aside strangeness with the shadow realm, I think delwath would say he is in his 2nd leya


[11/5/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
if anyone pressed him on his age


[11/5/2023 7:52 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, or he’d translate from human years from the start of the ka in which he was born


[11/5/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/5/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
(which is 1467 - for the 36th ka. but I just changed the start of the 36th leya to 1532)


[11/5/2023 7:53 PM] .deciusmus
But actually Delwath never experienced a mela. This return to Orenlas would be his first time returning to an elven place since he left for war in the 1532


[11/5/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/5/2023 8:01 PM] rsulfuratus
when does aurbez become a thing? and have you given any thought to the role of e.g. the rangers in the hobgoblin wars?


[11/5/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
I have not really thought much about the rangers. I keep kind of forgetting about them


[11/5/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
Although I have a few things in the Sembara notes where they show up


[11/5/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think they suffer somewhat in the end of the Great War, a lot of them die. I really liked what we came up with the other day around them being originally Insinguen


[11/5/2023 8:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think of them as really directly connected to Sembaran history


[11/5/2023 8:04 PM] .deciusmus
So I think they are mostly active in Maseau / Addermarch / Tyrwingha


[11/5/2023 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[11/5/2023 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
they are really more about the plaguelands than anything else


[11/5/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/5/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
As far as Aurbez, my Ausson's Crossing mini-series was set in 1688, and Aurbez was a not-yet-realized idea


[11/5/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
But I don't know if that has to be canonical


[11/5/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is good, I think before the victories in the 3rd hobgoblin war it would have been challenging to have much settlement in aurbez


[11/5/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
some outlanders scratching out a living, that kind of thing, but not really even villages


[11/5/2023 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I had the 1688 vibe be "very new frontier"


[11/5/2023 8:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I think people would have started moving there during the Peace of Cece, that is what marks, roughly, the "end' of the southern hobgoblin threat. (except the mad scientists)


[11/5/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but that's basically 1650. I am not sure when say, the road was built


[11/5/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
And it is possible also that south of Maseau was actually safer in the early 1600s


[11/5/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
Than north of Maseau I mean


[11/5/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/5/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
So you could actually have the initial "population boom" (still small, but) happen in the 1590s - 1610s as people flee south from the Shattered Ice Clan


[11/5/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure the details matter exactly right now, just trying to get a rough picture of what an elf who fought at the Battle of Urlich Monastery but then didn't return home for the next mela (in 1627) would have been doing if they basically hung around as a solider in the west/southern marches of sembara from 1545-1700 or so


[11/5/2023 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
the rangers are an obvious place for a lone elf solider, but not sure exactly what they would have been doing after the bloodlust wars, the blood plague, and all the chaos of the 1550s


[11/5/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
I'd say they would have ended up in Maseau and then the rangers.


[11/5/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
There is a ton of stuff in the Chronicle of Sembaran histor that isn't in the timeline yet

{Reactions}
👍

[11/5/2023 8:15 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe the rangers as beryl knew them don't really survive the blood years intact - they were invovled in dealing with the blood plague, for example


[11/5/2023 8:15 PM] rsulfuratus
a few people who remember the sacred springs of isingue or whatever keep the knowledge alive


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
Although actually the main bit that would be relevant was the magic going wrong around the 1580s


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
at the end of the doc


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that too


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
I think a core of relatively powerful rangers escaped Isingue and the plagues and death likely with Beryl's help, and established themselves in Maseau in the 1546


[11/5/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
and then rebuilt the organization, which was otherwise basically gone


[11/5/2023 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I guess the key thing is the continuity of knowledge going back to isingue about the sacred waters and such


[11/5/2023 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I think there should be something there, although it could be knowledge kept relatively secret


[11/5/2023 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
As far as your elf, the 1550s - 1602 has lots going on. I haven't written a history of Maseau, but they were a key part of the hobgoblin wars as well and were somewhat abandoned/cut off from Sembara and forced to stand on their own. Very much the kind of place that a elf might have been a key figure in


[11/5/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
Then in the early 1600s Sembara makes peace with the Shattered Ice Clan. But the 2nd Hobgoblin War, I think, was one where the hobgoblins explicitly wanted Maseau as a buffer


[11/5/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I'll look at the actual doc, I was just looking at the timeline. I know we shifted some dates around for the timeline but should be easy to recalibrate


[11/5/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
the more interested bit is after 1650


[11/5/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think by 1650, Maseau is pretty peaceful. The border has moved south and west


[11/5/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
But the stretch of lands between Maseau and Cleenseau is still relatively wild, and a solo elf might have gotten into various adventures there. Or they could have gone south towards Aurbez, which I think is where a lot of the rangers started going. The Ardonne river is choked with ash. Why? Etc.


[11/5/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
Adderfell is also a good possibility, in the post 1650 period


[11/5/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
The timeline in Chronicle doc is not aligned with the timeline in Timeline btw


[11/5/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
wasn't beryl a pretty good painter?


[11/5/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
next sesion is going to kind of be the Mike show


[11/5/2023 8:35 PM] .deciusmus
yes, he was


[11/5/2023 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
you might have to describe one of his paintings next session fyi


[11/5/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
ok 🙂


[11/5/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
btw, I was wondering if we should retcon the Urlich to be a pass not a monastery, or at least make the monastery secret/mystical rather than something people talk about


[11/5/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
(maybe it was always secret?)


[11/5/2023 8:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean it was lifted straight out of a dungeon magazine adventure, which I think we played, and then I just reused the location for the final battle


[11/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't remember much lore about why there was a monastery in a pass or whether the monasety was secret or not


[11/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but very easily could just be ulrich pass


[11/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
oh maybe there was some connection to the dwarven firstborn and the underground adventure to the proto-heart of the mountain?


[11/5/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
that would imply secret


[11/5/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
I think Ulrich Pass should be what people talk about, that's where the huge battle was. The "monastery" was obviously a real place of some sort (the final battle is one of the few things I remember really clearly from the high school game) but I think it should be a bit secret and maybe not really a monastry. If I recall it was some mystical place where the firstborn were more connected to taelgar or something


[11/5/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i am happy with urlich pass, and the Battle of Urlich Pass as the final battle of the Great War


[11/5/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
the monastery could just be an extraplanar weak point to the divine realm, historically protected by the dwarves or something like that. it is destroyed now anyway so the history isn't super important


[11/5/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
Although remember there was also a big battle at High Horn


[11/5/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't remember High Horn at all


[11/5/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't really remember it until I started digging through high school stuff on one drive


[11/5/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
I think one of your players in an abortive taelgar campaign you started in college was from there or something?


[11/5/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/5/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
But also, I think the big battle was not actually at Ulrich, although retconning it to be there is fine. I think we went south from the big battle to have the secondary mystical battle at the monastery


[11/5/2023 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess i think people would have seen the massive magical battle against the giant shadow dragon


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
it could be the Battle of High Horn and the Battle of Urlich Pass are considered two separate events


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, it is more satisfying to have had it taking place in the sky above the huge battle


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
with the Battle of Urlich Pass being you all gainst Cha'mutte


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
High Horn doesn't really exist anywyay


[11/5/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
It would I guess by somewhere in Ardlas or so


[11/5/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
But that's currently envisioned as a place where there are no passes over the mountains, instead humans traded with dwarves who traded with humans on the other side


[11/5/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I see it on the map


[11/5/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
let's just retcon it away

{Reactions}
👍

[11/5/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
Although it would suit the narrative history of Sembara if the highland kingdoms felt like the fought a thankless and costly unacknowledged war


[11/5/2023 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
that could also work - it isn't really acknowledged as the key battle of the war


[11/5/2023 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
The Sembaran armies massed at Ulrich Pass to stop the "main advance" of the hobgoblins from the west, and were the heroes who stood in the shadows of the actual heroes, and it becomes this whole myth-making thing


[11/5/2023 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
Well all this time, the highland kingdoms bled with the dwarves in the north, with no real support, and if they hadn't been there the Sembaran armies wouldn't have had a home to come back to


[11/5/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
Which actually works well with both the notes I have from highschool (that Sembaran "north armies" were weaker and less well supported) and the latter history


[11/5/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
When the hobgoblins attack Ardlas in the 1560s and Sembara still doesn't send aid, its the last straw, and causes these diplomatic breaks.


[11/6/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
Can't stay away from messing around with Obsidian instead of doing work... 🙂

I have a question on the map. I found an Obsidian leaflet plugin and it works really well to show the taelgar map (which I grabbed for now from https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarmap/)


[11/6/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
What did you do to set up the coordinate system though so that Lat/Long is correct and so that distances are correct?

I have been actually working all day 😝


[11/6/2023 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
The coordinate system is a huge mess - you can look at the taelgar map repo


[11/6/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
I got it working


[11/6/2023 4:58 PM] rsulfuratus
The thing I’ve been thinking about is moving away from the current static site generator to something a little more flexible.


[11/6/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
We are currently working on rebuilding our website for my group so I spent a lot of today browsing themes - the taelgar verse is kind of ugly compared to what’s out there


[11/6/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
The obsidian leaflet stuff is very cool but I’m not sure how easy it would be to push to web


[11/6/2023 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I’d love to be able to sync the leaflet taelgar map with the taelgar verse


[11/6/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
Eg with better ssg could do this: https://davidjvitale.com/tech/jekyll-leaflet/getting-started/

[11/6/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure what ssg means here


[11/6/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
static site generator


[11/6/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
something that converts md to html


[11/6/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
very popular in academic world


[11/6/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
https://snparcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


[11/6/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
for example, autobuilds website from md docs embedded in github repo


[11/6/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So I was going to say there are 2 architectures for an obsidian export --

1. A ssg that parses markdown to generate a site
2. An obsidian plugin that exports the obsidian rendered view (which is HTML, after all)

[11/6/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
The problem with any SSG in this scenario is that inevitably it won't be able to handle codeblocks very well


[11/6/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
Or, more specifically, to handle a code block it will increasingly need to reimplement stuff


[11/6/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
There are kinda hacky fixes in most cases, i.e. the stuff we already did with dataview special casing


[11/6/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is another option


[11/6/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess could imagine a workflow like: private vault -> public vault -> website or something


[11/6/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, if my day job was writing typescript I'd be tempted to just fork obsidian-webpage-export and change it to only export files linked from a root page


[11/6/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
I was messing around with it a little bit, it already exports dataview perfectly


[11/6/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't just the things not linked, it is things like dataview commands that pull up both secret and public files


[11/6/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
need to rerender the dataview in a vault that doesn't have the secret files


[11/6/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
Right, dataview with secrets doesn't work


[11/6/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Actually private -> export -> plugin to do the export is a much stronger workflow than anything else, as it allows various plugins to work


[11/6/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. private vault to export vault


[11/6/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
you could practically do it with the existing obsidian-webage-export, if the idea was say:
1. Run a python script or whatever that created the "to export" value. This would include only files from the linked node and strip the %%^Campaign blocks and such, but wouldn't render dataview blocks


[11/6/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
2. Trigger an export from the export value


[11/6/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
does the obsidian-webpage-export work with leaflet?


[11/6/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
not quite


[11/6/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't include the JS


[11/6/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but it does work with dataviewjs?


[11/6/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/6/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
So the leaflet exports correctly but because the leaflet JS isn't included, you can't scroll or interact with the map


[11/6/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus

[11/6/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
so you get something like the above, where clicking the icons doesn't do anything, and you can't + or - the map to change sizes


[11/6/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
whereas the dataview stuff works fine, because the dataview generates a static html page, and doesn't depend on loaded JS to work


[11/6/2023 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
so the options are basically:
a) run custom/specialized code to go from  obsidian vault -> clean md, and then use the massive set of tools available to build nice websites from clean md to generate the taelgarverse website
b) use custom code to sanitize the obsidian vault, then use specialized code to export the vault to html


[11/6/2023 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
the advantage of (b) is obviously that it is easy to build a lot of stuff in obsidian with dataview and similar tools that will get seemlessly exported


[11/6/2023 5:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the disadvantage of (b) is that you are kind of stuck relying on whoever is developing the obsidian html export


[11/6/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, on (b), that is only because neither of us really wants to learn typescript


[11/6/2023 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
syncing a plugin, i.e. by just having a custom "taelgar-html-export" that is un-git-ignored would be very easy


[11/6/2023 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
I think the real disadvantage of (b) is that it is very tightly coupled to Obsidian itself


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
and for example, if Obsidian wanted to try to push monetization of their own Publish flow, it could all fall apart


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that too


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Or if they are not careful about breaking changes. I'm looking at the export code and it is pretty deeply tied to the HTML structure that the obsidian rendering engine produces


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
in general it is just more brittle


[11/6/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Well, the brittleness is different


[11/6/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
The clean MD architecture is very brittle when using any code block or similar feature in Obsidian


[11/6/2023 5:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right, in the past we haven't used a ton of code blocks but with the events/timelines I can see those being really useful


[11/6/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
Or with leaflets, say


[11/6/2023 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right, but leaflets is actually where i was thinking that clean md + a ssg would be better. it would require a bit more tweaking but seems much more likely to a) consistently work, and b) be easy to use/look nice. 

e.g., do you know if you can use tiles with obsidian? for local browsing the 25 Mb map is fine but for web browsing it is noticably slow


[11/6/2023 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
You can use tiles but you need a server for that


[11/6/2023 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
theoretically is should be possible to tile any raster image and serve it from localhost


[11/6/2023 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah but obsidian-leaflets doesn't do that


[11/6/2023 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[11/6/2023 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, obsidian leaflet has an image mode or a tile mode, and it only supports local images via image mode


[11/6/2023 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
Dataview is really the main problem


[11/6/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Because of its complexity


[11/6/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
ALthough any highly complex plugin is complicated. For example, obsidian leaflet generates markers from location: tags in your vault


[11/6/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
No idea how easy it would be replicate that in something else


[11/6/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
some of that is fairly straightforward - e.g. the plugin i linked to above can do exactly that


[11/6/2023 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
Then again, something like Jekyll already works with YAML frontmatter so it should work trivially


[11/6/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
generally speaking I think that the real question is whether the website turns into a separate project for fiddling around with or not


[11/6/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
right now it basically is just what it is; with the obsdian website export it would be the same


[11/6/2023 6:09 PM] rsulfuratus
in both cases there is a small bit of python cleanup, but generally there would never be a lot of fiddling around with the website as a website


[11/6/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
Mermaid is another plugin I've used in a few places


[11/6/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
But it also has a jekyll equivalent


[11/6/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm. so looking at obsidianhtml, which we currently use (and is now no longer being developed, so probably worth moving on)


[11/6/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
it basically uses a github-secrets-like workflow to handle things like dataview


[11/6/2023 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
which doesn't work perfectly, but might something to think about


[11/6/2023 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to eat dinner... the complexity with dataview is related to executing the javascript


[11/6/2023 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I need to start cooking


[11/6/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea is you run obsidian website export to generate html


[11/6/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
then you cut out the dataview bits and replace them with the generated html


[11/6/2023 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
for the obisidian -> clean markdown, this could be useful

[11/6/2023 6:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Anyway for now I actually need to work on content if I spend more time on this. I’m taking the week of thanksgiving off so maybe will fiddle the


[11/6/2023 6:53 PM] rsulfuratus
*then


[11/7/2023 10:41 PM] .deciusmus
Two things as I was mucking around for a few minutes with maps + Javascript.

1. On maps, I really like having a map in Obsidian as it helps the worldbuilding a lot to be able to easily reference stuff. Do you have (a) a better map than the one on taelgar verse with (b) layers for political borders or climate? The obsidian leaflet does layers, so if you had a chance to export/push a set of PNGs I might play around


[11/7/2023 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
2. On whereabouts, I was thinking of simplifying the code generation a little bit, not totally sure the details, but basically trying to simplify a bit for two "common" cases
* Just a home or just an origin, or a home + origin with no dates
* a single excursion line, for NPCs where they are "currently" somewhere, but their home/origin are not clear


[11/8/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
re: maps, yes I have a rather fancy Photoshop map with layers for climate, many kinds of borders, etc. it is in need of some updating and haven't had a chance to do this, but perhaps will on Friday (which I have off)


[11/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
re: whereabouts, yes, simplification is good. i think for tracking complex npcs who travel a lot whereabouts is pretty clunky


[11/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
what is really useful is a way to basically tag "is the place where the PCs met the NPC their home or just a place they were traveling through"


[11/8/2023 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
and separately, it is useful to track "was the person originally from the place where they were met"


[11/8/2023 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
btw if you are messing around, would be nice to get get_EventsTable to parse DR-end as well as DR, maybe automatically generate a "X ends" event


[11/8/2023 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
I just got off talking for 5 hours straight of various meetings, so giving myself a little break from work to recover.  I've been meaning to add a DR_end to generate an end date for sure. Not sure about for inline, would you want something like:

* (DR:: 1701) - (DR_end:: 1702): Something something

Probably, right?


[11/8/2023 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
it works better for events files


[11/8/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I would probably mostly use it for events files


[11/8/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
in lists I'm more likely to do: 
- (DR:: 1701): Thing starts
- (DR:: 1703): Thing ends


[11/8/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i've been using DR-end, e.g. in Blood Years, for event files that span multiple years


[11/8/2023 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
For whereabouts, my thinking is that the the key goal of whereabouts is to indicate the difference between 3 things:
* Were an NPC was from if it is different from where they live
* Where an NPC lives
* Where an NPC was when the party met them if it is different from where they live

{Reactions}
👍

[11/8/2023 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yes agreed


[11/8/2023 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
Less often, it could be used to track shared NPCs who move, i.e. someone like Vistra who might have lived in place X for years A-B and then place Y for years C-D. Simarly, there are some NPCs (i.e. Kaeso) who move during a campaign, and it can be useful to track that via whereabouts change


[11/8/2023 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, i think the flexibility to account for individuals with multiple homes or multiple excursions is useful, but ideally the structure is set up to make that an optional add on not the main purpose


[11/8/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably NOT useful to use it to track goings and comings. i.e. if you had an NPC who is wandering across Dunmar (i.e. Sura) it is much more likely that you'd want do something like:

- date: 1748-01-29, type: excursion, place: traveling , region: Dunmar

Then to bother creating sequential records for each place they go


[11/8/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
If you wanted to track a detailed timeline of moves, you'd create a bulleted list instead


[11/8/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, agreed


[11/8/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
that said there are a few circumstances where i'd want sequential excursions. e.g., Antonia would be something like:
- date: xxxx, type: home, place: Chardon
- date: xxxx, type: excurision, place: traveling


[11/8/2023 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
- date: xxx, type: excursion (or home?), place: Mirror of Soul trapping


[11/8/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think that is better as a new home line


[11/8/2023 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
Well, maybe not


[11/8/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think the key thing is that usually you want to define where the character is traveling or "settled somewhere"


[11/8/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
and for the settled somewhere, you want to know whether is their origin/home/temporary place


[11/8/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
but you dont want to track in whereabouts **where** someone is travelling


[11/8/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, exactly


[11/8/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
so maybe type: excursion isn't actually correct


[11/8/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking about this differently, i wonder if having origin as part of whereabouts is actually not that useful?


[11/8/2023 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
Probably not. Origin maybe should just be a  frontmatter field


[11/8/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
i think whereabouts should basically just be a "settled at x at y time"; "traveling in x1 at y1 time"; "settled at x2 at y2 time"


[11/8/2023 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
(or based in instead of settled at, or whatever"


[11/8/2023 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
basic idea would be that if party meets a random traveler on the road, you can just add "traveling in x at y"


[11/8/2023 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking of it as:

* moved to X at time Y
* stopped in X at time Y until optional time Z
* was travelling from time X to optional time Z


[11/8/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
what is difference in moved to and stopped in though?


[11/8/2023 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
so for someone like Kadmos, you could say:
* origin chardon
* whereabouts:
** was traveling from time x


[11/8/2023 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
The output


[11/8/2023 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
So the idea is that 
stopped at is to capture the idea that someone was at a particular place at a particular time
travelling doesn't have a place. It just means they were away from home


[11/8/2023 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[11/8/2023 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
So the output text would for someone complicated would be something like:

Origin: <origin>
Based in: <home>
Current location: <traveling> or <stopped> place
Last seen by party: <stopped place> or <home>


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
It works best if we are relatively strict about saying if you are setting a last-seen-by-party date, you should also set a stopped
And perhaps the default for a "Stopped nested inside traveling" would be 1 day


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
is there a reason you'd ever care about a stopping place that wasn't also a "crossed paths with party" place?


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
In the simple case of I'm making up an NPC who is passing through but I don't know if the party is going to meet them and I don't want to decide where they are front


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
ah


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
okay


[11/8/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
You would have ONLY  a stopped place for the place they are,perhaps without even a date


[11/8/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
it would just render as

Current location: <stopped>


[11/8/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
with no based in or home


[11/8/2023 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I only ever make up full yaml information for people that you actually meet (or hear about), the notes I have for people that you remain unaware of just get recycled into my draft NPCs folder to be reused


[11/8/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think it is generically cleaner to track stopped locations (which can be multiple) and last seen locations (when needed, always just 1)


[11/8/2023 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
So the idea would be:

**Simple NPC who lives somewhere, no separate origin, no travel**
Set origin to someplace, no whereabouts
Renders as
Based in: xxx

**Simple NPC who lives somewhere, with a separate origin, no travel**
Set origin to someplace, whereabouts to a single item without a date, with a type of "home"
renders as
From: <origin>
Based in: <home>

**Simple NPC who was met somewhere no info about origin or home**
Set origin empty, wherabouts to a single item with a date and type of "stop", and a place
Renders as

Current location: (xyz)
This is dynamic so it might render as (unknown) if it is before the stop date or after the stop-end date


[11/8/2023 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
**More complex NPC with a home, but potentially who was away from home for some period, but where doesn't matter**
Set origin and home as desired, but set at least 1.
Whereabouts is a single item with a start date and potential stop date, of type : traveling
renders as

From/based in as bove
Current location: travelling (if within the travel date) or (home) if after the travel date


[11/8/2023 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
**More complex NPC who has a home and traveling and met PCs on travels**
Set origin and home
whereabouts has 2 items, a travelling and a stopped

From/based as above
Current Location : travelling or stopped depending


[11/8/2023 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think this is the right idea


[11/8/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so origin moves out of whereabouts, and becomes its own yaml item, which is just text


[11/8/2023 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
whereabouts changes to have three types: traveling, stop, home


[11/8/2023 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
then also start-date, end-date, place, region


[11/8/2023 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
region should ideally always be either a top-level or a second-level note or folder in gazetteer


[11/8/2023 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
start-date, end-date, and place should be optional, i think


[11/8/2023 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
although start-date is really only optional for home


[11/8/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
(region could also be something in cosmology, of course)


[11/8/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
end-date is assumed to equal start date if blank for type = stopped


[11/8/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
end-date is assumed to equal current date if blank for type = traveling (unless current date < start date)


[11/8/2023 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i haven't spent enough time looking at your event table code to figure out if this is the most sensible setup


[11/8/2023 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but it seems like if we just ignore homes without dates for parsing it isn't too bad


[11/8/2023 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
could also move home out of whereabouts, have it a separate list that just takes start-date (optional), place (optional), region (required)


[11/8/2023 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
then if you want "moved to X" to show up in the events table you need  to add it to an tagged list or


[11/8/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
So a full spec would be something like

Calculate the "home" and "origin" values as follows:
1. If there is no whereabouts, home and origin are both equal to the origin front matter, and neither are considered dynamic.
2. If there is exactly one whereabouts with type home, and that line has no date, or a date before bornYear-01-03, origin = origin frontmatter, home = home whereabouts and neither are considered dynamic.
3. If there is more than one home whereabouts, or one home whereabouts with a date after bornYear-01-03, home = dynamic, origin = origin frontmatter

Output the following information:

For the origin line:
* If origin is undefined, output nothing.
* If origin equals home and home is not dynamic, output nothing.
* If origin does not equal home, or home is dynamic, output "Originally from: <origin>"

For the home line:
* If home is undefined, output nothing.
* If home is defined but not dynamic, and origin != home, output: "Based in: <home>"
* If home is defined but not dynamic, and origin == home, output : "Location: <home>"
* If home is defined and dynamic, output a DataviewJS call to get_DynamicHome (spec follows)

For the current whereabouts line:
* If home is dynamic, or there is at least one whereabouts line with a type of travelling or stopped, output a call to get_CurrentWhereabouts (spec follows)
* Else output blank

For the last seen by party line:
* If there is at least one entry in the last seen by party section, parse the last seen by party dates to generate the correct output (spec follows)


[11/8/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
Dynamic Home Spec:

Find the home item in whereabouts that is >= the current date and output "Based in: <home>".
If there is no home item that is >= current date, output nothing


[11/8/2023 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
Current Whereabouts Spec:

Throw away all whereabouts lines without a date.
Throw away all whereabouts lines with a start date > current date.
Throw away all of the whereabouts lines with an end date < current date.


[11/8/2023 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
If there is 1 stopped line and 0 travelling lines and any number of home lines:
Current location: <stopped>


[11/8/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
If there is 1 or more stopped line and 1 travelling line and any number of home lines and the date == one of the stopped date:
Current location: <stopped that matches date>

If there is any number of stopped line and 1 travelling line and any number of home lines and the date != the any of the stopped date:
Current location: <travelling>


[11/8/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
If there are no stopped or travelling, use home.


[11/8/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
If there are stopped and home but no travelling, use last stopped


[11/8/2023 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
So basically the idea is:

* If you only have a single item that matches, we use that
* If you have a traveling value and a stopped "inside" that traveling period, we use the stopped location only if the date == the stopped date (i.e. stopped has an implicit end of start)
* If you are NOT travelling, the stopped has no implicit end and we use it instead of home if it matches


[11/8/2023 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
If you JUST have traveling and no stopped, we use travelling


[11/8/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
So for example
* Home = 1703
* Stopped  A= 1719
* Stopped B = 1720

We use stopped A in 1719, Home before 1719, Stopped B after 1719


[11/8/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
So for example
Home = 1703
Stopped  A= 1719
Stopped B = 1720, end 1721

We use Stopped B only until 1721, home after that


[11/8/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
So for example
Home = 1703
Travelling = 1718
Stopped  A= 1719
Stopped B = 1720

We use stopped A only for 1719, stopped B for 1720, travelling for anything after 1720


[11/8/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
etc


[11/8/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the only change i would make is to have stopped always have an implicit end == start if not specified


[11/8/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
in the case of just a stopped line, the output would be Current Location: (unknown)


[11/8/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
if the current date != stopped date


[11/8/2023 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
the argument is that most of the time, if you just have a stopped line, that is an NPC who was just passing through a place, and you have no idea where they were before or are going after


[11/8/2023 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe they are still there - maybe they are traveling elsewhere


[11/8/2023 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
the point is that information hasn't been invented yet and shouldn't be assumed


[11/8/2023 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
traveling, on the other hand, is probably fine to just assume continues into the future, unless it is explicitly decided the person stops


[11/8/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
Right that makes it easier as well


[11/8/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, instead of the spec I wrote.
* Assume that all home dates have an implicit end date of "death year"
* Assume that all travelling dates haven an implict end date of "death year"
* Assume that all stopped dates have an implicit end date of start date

If there is exactly 1 stopped whereabouts. Use that. If there are multiple stops whereabouts use the last.
If there are 0 stopped whereabouts and exactly 1 travelling whereabout, use (traveling). If there are multiple travelling ones use the last.
If there are 0 stopped and 0 travelling, use the home. If there are multiple, use the last

If the year is after the death year, and no whereabout explicitly has start > death, use (deceased)


[11/8/2023 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
the way i'd do it is:
Throw away all whereabouts lines without a date.
Throw away all whereabouts lines with a start date > current date.
Throw away all of the whereabouts lines with an end date < current date.

check to see if we have a precise location: 
for each stop 
 if stop_end <= cur_date and stop_start >= cur_date
  print Location: <stopped location>; break

check to see if we are traveling:
for each traveling:
 if travel_start >= cur_date and !travel_end or if travel_start >= cur_date and travel_end <= cur_date:
   print Location: traveling in <region>; break


[11/8/2023 1:22 PM] rsulfuratus
could add as well the home checking, if you want someone with a dynamic home to have "Based In: <home>; Current Location: <home>" instead of just "Based In: <home>"


[11/8/2023 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
alternatively, you could always just print either "Current Location: <home>" or "Current Location: (unknown)" if you don't have a stopped or traveling location


[11/8/2023 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway i think this makes sense as a general idea


[11/8/2023 7:49 PM] rsulfuratus
do you know why this doesn't work?
```dataviewjs
await dv.view("_scripts/view/get_EventsTable", { yearStart: 1748, yearEnd: 1749, pageFilter: " \"_DM_/timelines/unified_timeline\" ",includeAll: true } )
```


[11/8/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
getting rid of the full path doesn't work either


[11/8/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
is it a file or a folder


[11/8/2023 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
file


[11/8/2023 8:06 PM] .deciusmus
You have a space between the leading quote and the path


[11/8/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
includeBirth: input.includeBirth ?? input.includeAll ?? false,
        includeDeath: input.includeDeath ?? input.includeAll ?? false,

        includeExcursions: input.includeExcursions ?? input.includeAll ?? false,
        includePartyMeetings: input.includePartyMeetings ?? input.includeAll ?? false


[11/9/2023 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
Btw I spent a little time cleaning up whereabouts. I pushed a big update that gets rid of all of the old ways of doing it


[11/9/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
Ok, I rewrote the entire whereabouts stack

[11/9/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
No explanations yet but it is mostly in line with the discussion above


[11/9/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't fixed get event dates ye


[11/9/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
but born / died / etc now support full dates


[11/10/2023 8:40 AM] rsulfuratus
any reason not to merge your PR?


[11/10/2023 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
Breaks export I think


[11/10/2023 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
But otherwise no


[11/10/2023 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
Esp if you are going to fix exports

{Reactions}
👍

[11/10/2023 9:30 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah was going to work on that this weekend


[11/10/2023 9:30 AM] rsulfuratus
i have today off


[11/10/2023 9:34 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed some fixes just now


[11/10/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
I merged, so switch back to main if you do anything else


[11/10/2023 9:46 AM] .deciusmus
got it


[11/10/2023 9:46 AM] .deciusmus
I wanted you to review a few of the changes


[11/10/2023 9:46 AM] .deciusmus
But..


[11/10/2023 9:46 AM] .deciusmus
I was trying to fix some people's whereabouts and wasn't always sure it was correct


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
right, i'm looking at the recent changes now


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but also getting some weird bugs


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
```
Dataview: Failed to execute view '_scripts/view/get_HomeWhereabouts.js'.

TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
I was still fixing stuff last night


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
do you have customJS


[11/10/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
I moved a lot of stuff to depend on customJS


[11/10/2023 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
which file is showing this


[11/10/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah i have that


[11/10/2023 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
actually reloading obsidian seems to have fixed that particular issue


[11/10/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a fix for some issues btw


[11/10/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
The "new" whereabouts logic, btw, is as follows:

For simple NPCs just set origin to either origin: string or origin: { place: xxx, region: yyy }. Don't use whereabouts at all.
This will generate a dynamic "get_Homewhereabouts" line to the template, which will output either: Based in or Lived in depending on whether the NPC is alive or not.

For simple NPCs with a separate home and origin, set origin as above, plus a whereabouts with a {type: home, place:, region: } and no date.
This will generate a Originally from line with the origin plus a get_Homewhereabouts as above. 
If you know when the NPC moved from origin to home, you can set on a date on the home line. This will keep the originally from, but also add a "currentwhereabouts" dynamic line. (See below)

For complex NPCs with various more complexity, you set the full whereabouts structure. (see below)


[11/10/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
so i'm messing around a bit and actually i think the assumption that traveling continues forever is also probably wrong


[11/10/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. this is not necessarily correct:

[11/10/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
current location for Dain is unknown - might still be traveling in Illoria but I actually have no idea and haven't invented that detail


[11/10/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
would be much more useful to me to have "Last Known Location" than "current location"


[11/10/2023 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
simple option is to just report Last Known Location (last whereabouts date): Location


[11/10/2023 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
right now not sure how lastSeenByParty is handled


[11/10/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
So I was messing around with the idea of visit having an "end: true" or "end: false"


[11/10/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
So for example Antonia is in the mirror of soul trapping, which is an indefinite visit


[11/10/2023 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
so I wanted her to show as "current location: mirror of soul trapping"


[11/10/2023 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
but of course if the fantasy calendar date is 1800, who knows if that is true


[11/10/2023 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
But really actually that is just a way of turning off the implicit "a visit is 1 day"


[11/10/2023 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
i think rather than indefinite, in the cases where you actually have positively decided the stay is "a while" it is easy enough to just set an end date an estimated time in the future


[11/10/2023 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for antonia I'd just set end-date: 1751-12-10 which would be 3 years


[11/10/2023 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
if we ever play out what happens to her can change that, if not that is kind of a reasonable assumption, could even set { date: 1751-12-10, place: Voltara, type: home }


[11/10/2023 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
but my default assumption is that if i don't make a positive decision that something is happening for a certain length of time (even if just estimated), then we don't know if it continued for a day a week or a year


[11/10/2023 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
i think how i'd encode it is to have two dates: "last seen date", and "last known date". if last known date is < current date, the text is "Last Known Location (last known date): Location". if last known date is >= current date, the text is "Current Location (current date): Location"


[11/10/2023 10:24 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe the right thing to do is something like:

* assume visit and travel is 1 day if not otherwise set
* assume home is indefinite unless date_end is set
* calculate the "last known" location which is using the same logic as I have today, but uses the date of the whereabouts line, rather than the current fantasy calendar date, in the text (i.e. Last known location (as of xxx): (something)


[11/10/2023 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
yes exactly


[11/10/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure about the Current though -- the current location is different than last known


[11/10/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
But your rule is not right


[11/10/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
You can tell the different between "the current fantasy date matches a location" vs "the current fantasy date doesn't match a location"


[11/10/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
Basically, actually, what I said is totally wrong


[11/10/2023 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
Actually what you want is:
* Keep existing current location logic, but change travel to also have an implicit end date of 1 day


[11/10/2023 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
Then, the current location will be either an actual current location, or alternatively, unknown


[11/10/2023 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
the logic is:
1. if the current date is in the future (relative to last reported whereabouts), then current location doesn't exist (it is unknown, by definition). in this case you report Last Known Location (last known date): Location
2. if current date is in the past (relative to last reported whereabouts), then you know the location, and you report Current Location (current date): Location


[11/10/2023 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
Then, if current location is unknown, you also output:

Last known location (as of whereabouts_date): (last known)


[11/10/2023 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
right, I'm just suggesting if current location is unknown, it is probably just too much clutter to report both current location: unknown and Last known location


[11/10/2023 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
this assumes this is independent from last seen by party stuff


[11/10/2023 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
Is it too much clutter to have current: unknown and last known: something?


[11/10/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess that would be fine


[11/10/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
you could end up with 5 location lines, if you have from, home, last known, last seen by, and current


[11/10/2023 10:31 AM] .deciusmus
I kinda like it, as either

1) There is a known location - show
Current location (as of current date): xxx

2) There is no current location, but we do have a visit or travel that is not eligble to be current because it has ended
Current (as of current): unknown
Last known (as of whereabouts): yyy


[11/10/2023 10:31 AM] .deciusmus
Unlikely you'd have a home & last known


[11/10/2023 10:31 AM] .deciusmus
because we assume they are at home unless they are explicitly not


[11/10/2023 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm, that is not quite correct actually


[11/10/2023 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus
once someone leaves home, can't assume they are there unless they are explicited returned there


[11/10/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
But that's why I made travel indefinite


[11/10/2023 10:35 AM] rsulfuratus
that isn't quite right either. e.g. someone who is "traveling in X" in DR 1719 is probably not still traveling in X in DR 1749


[11/10/2023 10:35 AM] rsulfuratus
but can't assume they are home either


[11/10/2023 10:35 AM] rsulfuratus
technically someone who just has a home line with no end can't assume to be home 20 years in the future either


[11/10/2023 10:35 AM] rsulfuratus
but generally speaking I think the simplifying assumption is there are two types of NPCs: those that travel and those that don't


[11/10/2023 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
taking the trouble to fill out whereabouts is an implicit signal that this is an npc that travels


[11/10/2023 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
the concept is basically we have a "knowledge cutoff date" for each npc


[11/10/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
if there is nothing but a home or a home/origin, we implicitly assume knowledge cutoff date = current date, which is fine


[11/10/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
someone can make something up but the default, unless you actively invent a contrast, is they just stay home forever


[11/10/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
if there is a whereabouts line, and the last line is a home entry, same assumption


[11/10/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
if there is a whereabouts line and the last line is not a home entry (its a stop, or traveling) then the knowledge cutoff date is not current date, its the last whereabouts date


[11/10/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
we assume we have no idea where they are after that


[11/10/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
basically, if the last recorded location for an NPC is home or origin, then they remain there until told otherwise


[11/10/2023 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
if the last recorded location for an NPC is traveling or stop, then they are in a quantum indeterminate state at any date after last recorded


[11/10/2023 11:02 AM] .deciusmus
See, I'm not sure about that


[11/10/2023 11:02 AM] .deciusmus
one sec, have to pay attention to my meeting for a bi


[11/10/2023 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
See, I think the right logic is back to the idea of defined vs undefined ends. I think if you say:

- home = Cleenseau
- travel to Dunfry, start = Jan 5, end = Jan 29

It is very reasonably to assume that after Jan 29 they are back home


[11/10/2023 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it makes sense to have to go back and add ANOTHER home line, or something like that


[11/10/2023 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that's sensible


[11/10/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
I think what you actually want is to say that logically, every whereabouts line is:

* a start date
* an end date
* a place

Then to find the current location of someone, you just find the whereabouts that started before the current date and ended after the current date, and if there are multiples, you take the one with the shortest duration


[11/10/2023 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
that makes nested work nicely, i.e. you could have

- home Chardon ( 1719 - 1740 )
- travel Green Sea ( 1722 - 1725 )
- visit Irrla  (1723)
- travel western Irrla (1723 May - July)
- visit some town in western irrla ( June 10 - 15)


[11/10/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
obviously you wouldn't bother with that level of detail for most characters


[11/10/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
but the algorithm with work


[11/10/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
Then, to make it not annoying, you need a mechanism to not have to make up start and end dates for everything


[11/10/2023 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
my main goal is to have sensible assumptions that don't require a lot of extra work


[11/10/2023 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
So...
type = home, assume the start = born, end = died


[11/10/2023 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
type = visit and travel, assume end = start


[11/10/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
then, if it seems useful, we could add an "indefinite: true" to visit and travel, which would assume end = died as well


[11/10/2023 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
but realistically I'm not sure if that matters, because usually if someone is travelling you want to assume the travel ends


[11/10/2023 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
Then you can implement your idea of "travelling" or "not travelling" by setting an end on the home or not


[11/10/2023 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
So character 1:
- home = Cleenseau, no start or end
- travel = Dunfry, start = 1720 end = 1721

will show as in Cleenseau outside of 1720-1721

Character 2:
- home = Cleenseau, no start, end = 1720
- travel = Dunfry, start = 1720 end = 1721

Will show in Cleenseau up to 1720, travelling in Dunfry 1720 - 1721, and unknown after 1721


[11/10/2023 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
Basically character one would have, in 1720

Home: Cleenseau
Current Location: travelling in Dunfry

And in 1722
Home: Cleenseau

Whereas character two would have, in 1720

Origin: Cleenseau
Current Location: travelling in Dunfry

And in 1722:

Origin: Cleenseau
Last Known Location (1721): travelling in Dunfry
Current Location: unknown


[11/10/2023 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
Then last seen by party works exactly the same, except it uses the "last seen by date" rather than the "current date" to get the current location.


[11/10/2023 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
So a different simple case might be a traveling merchant the party met at an inn who has no home or origin.

There you'd have one line
type: visit, place = the Inn, date = the date
last seen by party = the date

It would output

Last Seen By Party (the date): the inn
Last Known Location (the date): the Inn
Current Location: unknown


[11/10/2023 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the complication for me is that i usually don't want to work out complicated travel histories, just to be able to record when people were at specific locations


[11/10/2023 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
doesn't this let you do that?


[11/10/2023 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus
well i guess what happens if you have no home?


[11/10/2023 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
see example above


[11/10/2023 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
right okay


[11/10/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
but ignore last seen by party, to make it simpler.

If you have a single line in whereabouts:

- type: visit, date = some date, place = the Inn

It would output if the fantasy calendar date == some  date

Current location (some date): the inn

And if the fantasy calendar date > some date

Last known location (some date): the inn
Current location (fant. cal date): unnknown


[11/10/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
and if the fantasy calendar date < some date:

Current location (fant cal date): unknown


[11/10/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
if you know they were at the inn for a week (say because the were an important NPC in the session and the whole session was at the inn), you could add an end: <some date + 1 week> which would extent the period of time the current location showed as the inn


[11/10/2023 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
But realistically that is rarely worth bothering with


[11/10/2023 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay. i think setting the end date of home to be xxx to indicate someone should be considered "traveling until stated otherwise" is fine


[11/10/2023 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
presumably then one could just add another home line, or alternatively delete the end date, if they return


[11/10/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/10/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
although, what you really want, is the ability to not set the home date


[11/10/2023 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
it would be nice to support the edge case of "left home at 1748-08-22, traveling in Illoria at 1748-10-23" and have location between 08-22 and 10-23 be unknown


[11/10/2023 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
then it is just the default assumption if home has no date


[11/10/2023 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
That would work if automatically if you set home end = 1748-08-22


[11/10/2023 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay


[11/10/2023 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, you could set

type: travelling (with no place) with a start of 1748-08-22 and an end of 1748-10-23


[11/10/2023 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
then it would say

Home: Chardon
Location: travelling

If you were >08/22 but before 10/23


[11/10/2023 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
It really depends on whether you want the whereabouts section to report their home as chardon or not


[11/10/2023 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
or whatever


[11/10/2023 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, here also it might be easier to just set "traveling" from 1748-08-22 on and then track events with date tag


[11/10/2023 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/10/2023 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
But I actually think there is a missing feature here


[11/10/2023 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
Which is the idea of "hazy future"


[11/10/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
Although actually


[11/10/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
in your example above, what do you want to show as the location on 10-24-1748


[11/10/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
"unknown" with "last know" = traveling in Iloria?


[11/10/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/10/2023 1:09 PM] .deciusmus
right, so what you want is the ability to flag something as "hazy future"


[11/10/2023 1:09 PM] .deciusmus
Which would mean - they are not in THIS place forever, but they are not home either


[11/10/2023 1:09 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure how to do it exactly


[11/10/2023 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
But imagine two characters. One who has gone for an extended travel, and it isn't clear where they are exactly, but they are not home.
The other who has actually moved to a new home or is moving


[11/10/2023 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
For one you want to see

Home: Cleenseau
Last known location: traveling in the Plaguelands
Current location: Unknown

For the other you want to see

Originally from: Cleenseau
Last known location: traveling in the Plaguelands
Current location: Unknown


[11/10/2023 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm. i don't actually really care about the "Home" or "Originally from" distinction


[11/10/2023 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
It isn't super relevant for the actual text output, but I was playing around with the idea of a data view query you could add to a place that would show:

* all the people who live in the place
and also
* all the people who are currently in the place


[11/10/2023 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i think of "home" as "associated with"


[11/10/2023 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I agree that home = associated with


[11/10/2023 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. I'd still want Dain to have "Based in: Chardon" despite current location being unknown


[11/10/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that is where the "hazy future" comes in


[11/10/2023 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i just don't want to assume people are home at an arbitrary date in the future


[11/10/2023 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
or assume they are at their last known location either


[11/10/2023 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
this is why I kind of like the concept of a knowledge horizon


[11/10/2023 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think that is what I mean by hazy future


[11/10/2023 1:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so the way I would probably do is is track a "knowledge horizon" variable for each NPC. 

if they have no whereabouts lines, the knowledge horizon is the current date. 
if they have a whereabouts line, the knowledge horizon is the last recorded date in the whereabouts


[11/10/2023 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
See I don't think that is quite right


[11/10/2023 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the conflict is about what to do with people who finish traveling


[11/10/2023 1:16 PM] .deciusmus
Because I want to record an end date for a visit or travel, and assume that the have returned home


[11/10/2023 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/10/2023 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess my argument then is that if you know they returned home, you probably should write that down somewhere


[11/10/2023 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. by having a whereabouts line with home or something else


[11/10/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
See for me, I don't want to do that because it is too cluttered. My use case is ~10 important NPCs in Cleenseau


[11/10/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
I'd like to be able to, in session prep for say me next session, record that some of these folks are gone on various errands or whatever


[11/10/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
Then, I can easily just set the fantasy calendar date to the current in game date and see who is or is not in town


[11/10/2023 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm


[11/10/2023 1:18 PM] .deciusmus
But if in game, someone returns (or in between sessions I decide they return), I just want to set the end on the visit / travel line


[11/10/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
I could just delete it but that seems sad, because it seems cool to have a record of the travels


[11/10/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
But I definitely don't want to have to set an end on the travel line AND add a new home line


[11/10/2023 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
ah. right. but what if having an end date on the travel line implicitly indicates that the person returned home


[11/10/2023 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
(or, rather, on the last travel line)


[11/10/2023 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
a person who has no uncompleted travel is home


[11/10/2023 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
a person who is traveling with a start date, but not an end date, has a hazy future


[11/10/2023 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that probably works for all our use cases


[11/10/2023 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
the other idea is what if the output of type: travel with no place isn't "travelling" but "unknown"


[11/10/2023 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
that is probably a good idea as well


[11/10/2023 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, in combo with your idea


[11/10/2023 1:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so in that case, home should only have start/end if a person has multiple homes


[11/10/2023 1:22 PM] .deciusmus
Right, or has left home with no new home


[11/10/2023 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
right, e.g. someone like Dee Wildcloak who fled chardon for "parts unknown"


[11/10/2023 1:23 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/10/2023 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but for 'traveling with hazy future', you just set a whereabouts line


[11/10/2023 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
in that case, i'm not sure whereabouts even needs a type


[11/10/2023 1:23 PM] .deciusmus
Well, it is nice for defaults


[11/10/2023 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
well in this case i'm assuming everything important can be inferred from whether end date exists


[11/10/2023 1:25 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., if you have wherebabouts with a start date but no end date, then you report last known location and current location unknown


[11/10/2023 1:25 PM] .deciusmus
It's hard to represent "home" though


[11/10/2023 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. to have Based in: xxx, Last known: yyy, current: unknown


[11/10/2023 1:26 PM] rsulfuratus
originally from: xxx, based in: yyy are always reported if origin and home exist (and are different)


[11/10/2023 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
but without a type, how do you know what is home?


[11/10/2023 1:26 PM] rsulfuratus
home is not part of whereabouts


[11/10/2023 1:27 PM] .deciusmus
but then how do you manage someone who moves?


[11/10/2023 1:27 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. Vistra


[11/10/2023 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
home can have multiple entries


[11/10/2023 1:27 PM] .deciusmus
I don't thnk that saves anything


[11/10/2023 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
or maybe it is easier to have whereabouts with type = home and type = something else


[11/10/2023 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
that is fair


[11/10/2023 1:27 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/10/2023 1:27 PM] .deciusmus
I do think the distinction between "travel" and "visit" is maybe not important


[11/10/2023 1:28 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. you have whereabouts with 

* start (optional)
* end (optional)
* type (home or away, required)
* place (optional)

You need at least one of start or place


[11/10/2023 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
although actually I think start is required


[11/10/2023 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
start is required, yes


[11/10/2023 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
unless type = home, in which case null start = birth


[11/10/2023 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/10/2023 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i haven't looked at your code, but i wonder if the way to do this isn't a bunch of logical tests, but just to construct a set of date intervals for each person


[11/10/2023 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
you construct a set of home intervals and a set of whereabouts intervals, and record the last known date as well


[11/10/2023 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
then the "based in" line is -> query home intervals, print "based in: XXX" or nothing


[11/10/2023 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
the location line is -> query whereabouts, return location, if unknown print current location unknown plus query with last recorded date and print that as last known location


[11/10/2023 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
the main thing then is to consider how to decide when a person is hoome


[11/10/2023 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but when you construct location intervals, could fill "defined gaps" with home and "undefined gaps" with unknown


[11/10/2023 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
so basically:

* start (required for away, defaults to birth if not set for home)
* end (optional)
* type (home or away)
* place (required for home, optional for away if end is empty. required if end is present)

Logic is:
Logical end = start if end is undefined, otherwise end

Find the "exact known whereabouts". This takes all of the whereabouts where type = away, start is before or equal to current, and logical end is before or equal to current. If there are multiples take the one with the smallest duration between start and logical end. This could be empty.
Find the "home whereabouts". This is everything with type = home where start <= current and end >= current or where start <= current and end is unset. If there are multiples take the one with the most recent start date.
Find the "last known whereabout": This takes all of the whereabouts where type = away, start is before or equal to current, finds the one with the most recent logical end. 

If there is a home whereabouts, output
Based in: <home>

If there is an exact known whereabouts, output:
Current Location: <exact known>

If there is no exact known whereabouts:

if there is a home whereabouts and a last known whereabouts, and the last known whereabouts has an end, and it is in the past, output:
Current Location: <home>

Otherwise, if the last known whereabouts exists, and does not have an end, output:
Last known (date): last known
Current Location: Unknown


[11/10/2023 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that is it.

so for example, if I didn't want to decide exactly when Dain left Chardon, I could have:
- start: , end:, type: home, location: Chardon
- start: 08-27-1748, end:, type: away, location: Chardon
- start: 10-23-1748, end:, type: away, location: Illora


[11/10/2023 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
for dates before 08/27, you would just get: Based in: Chardon and no current or last known location


[11/10/2023 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
on 08/27, you'd get: Based in: Chardon, Current Location: Chardon


[11/10/2023 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
between 8/28-10/22, you'd get: Based in: Chardon, Current Location: unknown, Last Known (8/28): Chardon


[11/10/2023 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
on 10/23, you'd get: Based in: Chardon, Current Location: Illoria


[11/10/2023 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
after 10/23, you'd get: Based in: Chardon, Current Location: unknown, Last Known (10/22): Illoria


[11/10/2023 1:50 PM] rsulfuratus
if I later added an end: 01-25-1749 to the last away line, then for any dates after 1/25 you'd go back to "Based in: Chardon" with no current or last known


[11/10/2023 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
Yes


[11/10/2023 1:50 PM] rsulfuratus
that seems perfect


[11/10/2023 1:52 PM] rsulfuratus
for someone for whom you have very little information (e.g., a halfling traveler at an inn somewhere), you just end up with "Current Location: unknown; last known (date): inn"


[11/10/2023 1:52 PM] rsulfuratus
which is also exactly what you want


[11/10/2023 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
The one additional wrinkle is origins.

Which, I think works best by adding:

* Determine the "origin whereabouts": This is everything with type: home and just selects the one with the earliest start date.

Then if we have >1 whereabouts with type: home, and output:

Originally from: <origin>

In addition to everything else


[11/10/2023 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
That way, if you wanted to decide that Dain is never going back to Chardon, you could instead set end: 8-27-1748 on home line


[11/10/2023 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
so, the only downside to that is it requires inventing when someone moved


[11/10/2023 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
You mean for the cases where you want a different origin and home but don't care when?


[11/10/2023 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/10/2023 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
One sec, getting to that


[11/10/2023 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
what we had before worked for that but had the downside of polluting the events tables with "moved to" at artificially precise dates


[11/10/2023 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
Actually, it works fine.

If there are multiple home whereabouts with no start or end, we just take as the actual home whereabout the lexically last in the list


[11/10/2023 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
So if you have

- type: home, place: somewhere in the feywild
- type: home, place: Shimmersong

It would output

Originally from: somewhere in the feywild
Based in: Shimmersong


[11/10/2023 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay, that is great


[11/10/2023 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
if you add a third line it is probably because you care when someone moved, but if you add a third line without any dates, it just means the 2nd line never gets printed


[11/10/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/10/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
that would be a bit pointless, you may as well just change the 2nd line


[11/10/2023 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/10/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
it might be nice to have a fuzzy_date: true


[11/10/2023 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
well, maybe if you want to remember that they spent time in X but don't want to check dates at the momemt


[11/10/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
which would mean the date should be ignored for events tables


[11/10/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
especially if I do time-jump my campaign into the 1730s/early 1740s it might be useful for shared NPCs who are canonically in place A and time X and place B and time Y but no one wants to decide when they actually moved


[11/10/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
i would actually prefer to have those show up in the events table


[11/10/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
just have a comment in yaml #approx or something


[11/10/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
ok


[11/10/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
sure that probably makes more sense actually


[11/10/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
so that we know they can be changed. the events table stuff is great for checking internal consistency


[11/10/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
righ


[11/10/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
i think as a general rule it makes sense to use  #approx or similar comments liberally in yaml for any shared npcs to delineate what is a guess and what is canonically

{Reactions}
👍

[11/10/2023 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
so then the final piece would be what does the events table output? For example what does this generate:

start: , end:, type: home, location: Chardon
start: 08-27-1748, end:, type: away, location: Chardon
start: 10-23-1748, end:, type: away, location: Illora


[11/10/2023 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
simplest is just "Was in"


[11/10/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
was in is definitely the best


[11/10/2023 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
or if there is a start and end, an "arrived " and "left "


[11/10/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
i would say:
- just start: turns to "Was in", or "Arrived at" if end is defined
- end: turns to "Left"


[11/10/2023 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
right, makes sense


[11/10/2023 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly for generating "So and so left Chardon" when you have type: home, and just an end date


[11/10/2023 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that the events table can ignore type, actually


[11/10/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
(except for inputing "Born at:" events from born dates)


[11/10/2023 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
I think you want to say "Moved to" for home that has start but no end


[11/10/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is also good


[11/10/2023 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
as opposed to "Was in"


[11/10/2023 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, actually, that reminds me, the last thing for whereabouts is that if the current date is > died, shouldn't print location information at all (but we should assume died = 12-31-diedYear)


[11/10/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
Yes agreed


[11/10/2023 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
might print last known location actually


[11/10/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
Actually, wait disagree


[11/10/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
🙂


[11/10/2023 2:07 PM] .deciusmus
It should print:

* originally as if they were alive, if it exists
* lived in, rather than based in, if there is a home
* never any current location
* last known location as normal, if it would otherwise be printed


[11/10/2023 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes, the originally/home stuff should stay


[11/10/2023 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i just meant current location information


[11/10/2023 2:08 PM] .deciusmus
right, for that I'd print last know if we would have otherwise


[11/10/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would work, just means that if someone dies traveling and you want where they died to be recorded as last known, you have to leave the end date off


[11/10/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
that's good


[11/10/2023 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
right, which now that died supports day-precise dates, is fine


[11/10/2023 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
I think in the past we were using whereabouts with place: dead to track that someone died on May 5, not just some random date in the year


[11/10/2023 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, but this way is better


[11/10/2023 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
but now you can just do: died: 1702-05-11


[11/10/2023 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
yes, definitely


[11/10/2023 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
we probably need some consistent tests for this, i was going to work on the python code and will verify we are reporting same output


[11/10/2023 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
I'm writing a spec in Obsidian now


[11/10/2023 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
also do you want to stick with three separate functions? page dated value, home whereabouts, current whereabouts


[11/10/2023 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
plus i guess regnal value for royalty


[11/10/2023 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
(Sorry dealing with work for a min, give me a sec)


[11/10/2023 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
So the original goal of the split functions was
(a) to make the python simpler
(b) to make it less likely to require dataview queries on some pages
(c) make the dataview queries simpler

I'm not sure if those are truly sensible


[11/10/2023 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the way to make the python simpler is implement as much as possible in metadataUtils.js


[11/10/2023 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
I suspect we want

getPageDated => for the born/year/etc stuff
getRegnal => for the reign
getLocation => for everything else


[11/10/2023 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
can you call metadataUtils from python?


[11/10/2023 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
or is it just easier for some other reason?


[11/10/2023 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
no, not that i'm aware of, but it is much easier for me to reimplement a bunch of functions


[11/10/2023 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
really just the smaller each function is the easier it is to make sure it does the same thing in python


[11/10/2023 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[11/10/2023 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure how far you have gotten, but I was going to move a bunch of the logic into metadata utils


[11/10/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
right now i'm stuck on trying to decipher the fantasy calendar json to reimplement:
```
    get_displayDateFromPieces(day, month, year) {
        let currentFantasyCal = FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0];
        let date = { year: year, month: month, day: day };        
        return FantasyCalendarAPI.getDay(date, currentFantasyCal).displayDate;
    }
```


[11/10/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
So I was about to suggest maybe it would be easier for metadataUtils to have a "setCurrentDate", and then you could just call that yourself


[11/10/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
like, there is a lot I could do to structure metadataUtils to be more portabe


[11/10/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
but I don't know if that is worthwhile if I don't get to it until next week 🙂


[11/10/2023 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
i want to get the export working this weekend because I want to update session notes


[11/10/2023 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the structure of metadataUtils isn't too bad and I can hack around a bit in javascript in some cases too


[11/10/2023 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
parse_date_to_events_date is going to be annoying


[11/10/2023 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
but everything else looks pretty easy


[11/10/2023 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
github copilot is actually pretty much perfectly auto-generating the python code for me


[11/10/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
just be aware that the javascript code does't match this convo


[11/10/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, so far i'm just implementing the helper functions


[11/10/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
pushed a spec


[11/10/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
you might be better off, for get_CurrentWhereabouts, just ignoring the helper function and using the spec


[11/10/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
oh the other reason we wanted 2 scripts was to separate the last seen by party


[11/10/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. to have

origin
home
last seen by part
last known
current


[11/10/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm trying to figure out the date logic you have, as I think i can do this simpler in python. the assumption is that we have either:
YYYY
YYYY-MM


[11/10/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
YYYY-MM-DD


[11/10/2023 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
and that for sorting and other purposes, if MM is missing, it is set to 1, and if DD is missing it is set to 1


[11/10/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/10/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
well, actually


[11/10/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
I think for "end" dates we assume 12-31 or last day


[11/10/2023 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a bunch of spec


[11/10/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/10/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
Encourage you to read the specs in _MOC\Templates and Scripts rather than look at a the Javascript


[11/10/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
fixed a lot of logical bugs when writing them


[11/10/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
you might be better off with just a reimplement from scratch using the spec than anything else


[11/10/2023 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
I think the specs are pretty clear and should be trivial to implement from


[11/10/2023 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
re: this "Note that in frontmatter, specifying YYYY-MM and YYYY-MM-01 are identical. If you want to indicate that the day is unknown, set the date as YYYY-MMx"


[11/10/2023 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
does this imply that if I split on `-` I can't assume outputs of split are ints?


[11/10/2023 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/10/2023 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
Javascript parseInt happily ignores the trailing junk


[11/10/2023 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
which makes it easy


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, we could define that ONLY MMx is valid


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
literally x I mean


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
no it doesn't matter, easy to trim non-numeric chars


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
just trying to get the clean_date function correct as everything depends on that


[11/10/2023 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/10/2023 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
the Javascript is  pain for that because we have 4 types of dates:

- Luxon dates from Dataview


[11/10/2023 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
- JS Dates from YAML
- String dates 
- "fantasy calendar" dates which are very similar to Luxon dates but they have 0index rather than 1index months


[11/10/2023 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
In python you just have a string so in theory much easier


[11/10/2023 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
born, created, founded, built: these are used to determine at what point the page started to exist. If the page has a type, then only the type value will be used. Otherwise, the order here is searched and the first defined one used.


[11/10/2023 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
why don't we just use born and change the output text by type?


[11/10/2023 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
seems unnecessarily complicated for coding


[11/10/2023 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
or, if that is too annoying, use born (living things) created (non-living things)


[11/10/2023 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
died (living) destroyed (non-living)


[11/10/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, lets do that


[11/10/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
I don't love born/died for buildings


[11/10/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
but lets do born/created and died/destroyed

👍

[11/10/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
probably better to just say:

if NPC or Ruler or PC, use born
else if no type or any other type use created


[11/10/2023 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/10/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
ca you update the spec file


[11/10/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
actually I will


[11/10/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
my logic for current date:
1. if the page as a pageTargetDate, use that
2. if there is no pageTargetDate, but you specify a date on the command line, use that
3. if there is no pageTargetDate and you don't specific a date on the command line, use the current date in the data.json fantasy calendar info

{Reactions}
👍

[11/10/2023 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
mine is:

    get_pageEventsDate(metadata) {

        if (metadata.pageTargetDate) {
            return this.parse_date_to_events_date(metadata.pageTargetDate, false);
        }

        return this.parse_date_to_events_date(window.FantasyCalendarAPI.getCalendars()[0].current, false);
    }


[11/10/2023 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
basically skipping the cmdline


[11/10/2023 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
your specs are great, takes like 10 minutes to code each function with that plus copilot


[11/10/2023 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i have the page date and the regnal date reimplemented with a cleaner way to handle dates


[11/10/2023 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't tested yet


[11/10/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, well, writing specs like that is what I do for a living


[11/10/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
at least sometimes


[11/10/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
why do we have place, region separate in whereabouts?


[11/10/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess it is to do dataview queries?


[11/10/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
would it not make more sense to just do a text query? e.g. whereabouts.home.location contains "Tokra"


[11/10/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
feel like we are not consistent about what goes in each bit (place vs region) and it would be easy enough to have just location: "Chardon, Chardonian Empire, The West Coast Region"


[11/10/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
then in code can split on commas and any subpiece gets links


[11/10/2023 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense


[11/10/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
the "exact whereabouts" spec is't quite right


[11/10/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
sorry


[11/10/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
last known


[11/10/2023 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is backwards: "Sets the "page exists" flag to true if the Page End Date is defined Page End Date is before the Target Date"


[11/10/2023 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
or rather if page end date is not defined this should be true too should it not


[11/10/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/10/2023 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
should be "not defined or "


[11/10/2023 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
kate and i are going out to dinner so i'm not going to work on this more tonight but i should be able to finish all the python code tomorrow morning, then will test

{Reactions}
👍

[11/10/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i also will probably write some code tomorrow that scans a directory, and cleans up yaml.
1. removes home, homeRegion, origin, originRegion, location, locationRegion and sets whereabouts, also added a tag to make it easy to check files that are updated this way (they will have incorrect dates)
2. updates whereabouts lines to current spec if they don't meet it (here probably less concern about errors, so won't tag)

{Reactions}
👍

[11/10/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
if we have a good metadata spec at some point this could be extended to do something like:
1. read in file, parse yaml
2. write out yaml based on spec, with empty values for missing things
3. delete yaml frontmatter not in spec, but write out deleted yaml to a comment box immediately at the start of the file in case it was important


[11/10/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
I might take a stab at a metadata spec


[11/10/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
Although I think only thing we have well defined is NPC


[11/10/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
And even there the “family” / “organization” stuff


[11/10/2023 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
Is a bit vague


[11/10/2023 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a proposed metadata spec


[11/11/2023 8:51 AM] rsulfuratus
there are a few issues with the whereabouts spec i think


[11/11/2023 8:53 AM] rsulfuratus
first, on home/origins - are we assuming that origin is a separate yaml entry, not part of whereabouts? otherwise, i don't see how it is possible for there ever to be a origin whereabout without a home whereabout
```
   # An origin location is defined as
    # Value: the origin whereabout
    # Output: origin whereabout is defined and whereabouts with type home > 1 or the origin whereabout is defined and there is no home whereabout
```


[11/11/2023 8:54 AM] .deciusmus
You don’t have a home where about if you have a home with an end


[11/11/2023 8:54 AM] rsulfuratus
ah right, okay


[11/11/2023 8:54 AM] .deciusmus
I did change the logic when I was implementing to say just don’t show origin of origin and home are the same


[11/11/2023 8:55 AM] .deciusmus
So basically origin = first home; home = last valid home. 

Show both if they are different
Only show home if they are the same


[11/11/2023 8:56 AM] .deciusmus
First = first in the list; last = last in the list but filtered by start / end


[11/11/2023 8:56 AM] rsulfuratus
right, okay, so if you want a traveler with a defined origin but no home, you can just create type=home, start=undefined, end=born (or any arbitrary time < current date)


[11/11/2023 8:56 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/11/2023 8:57 AM] rsulfuratus
the other was the checking for home/origin value identity but that is easy to implement


[11/11/2023 8:57 AM] .deciusmus
Right - given the move to a single location value I just checked locations are equal


[11/11/2023 8:58 AM] rsulfuratus
also, is it correct to assume a whereabouts must have a location and type but everything else is optional?


[11/11/2023 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
(technically an away location with no dates will work strangely/not at all, i guess)


[11/11/2023 9:01 AM] .deciusmus
Away locations should have a start. Home locations don’t need dates.


[11/11/2023 9:01 AM] .deciusmus
Location is not required at all, if there is no location it should render as unknown


[11/11/2023 9:02 AM] .deciusmus
So if someone is traveling in unknown parts you can just set away ; start date


[11/11/2023 9:02 AM] .deciusmus
I’m not sure if the spec implies that


[11/11/2023 9:02 AM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[11/11/2023 9:03 AM] .deciusmus
I suppose it might be nice if a home location with no location rendered as blank


[11/11/2023 9:03 AM] .deciusmus
Then you could do:
Type home: location = some origin
Type home; # not sure where they live now


[11/11/2023 9:05 AM] rsulfuratus
for my parsing, though, i'm now just doing the following:
1. type must exist, throw an error if you have whereabouts line that has no type (currently allows for non-home or non-away types, but these will never be output)
2. value is constructed from location (preferred) or "place, region" (if no location), and set to "Unknown" if doesn't exist
3. if type is away, a start date must exist, and an error is thrown if it doesn't exist

{Reactions}
👍

[11/11/2023 9:09 AM] .deciusmus
Although I think I’d leave location blank on the parse side and set to unknown on output only


[11/11/2023 9:14 AM] rsulfuratus
all  dview functions except the get event date are now implemented in python - testing now so will have to debug for a bit before output works


[11/11/2023 9:19 AM] .deciusmus
I haven't actually implemented the get_Current yet 😄


[11/11/2023 9:19 AM] .deciusmus
but plan to at some point this weekend


[11/11/2023 9:19 AM] .deciusmus
I also think there are some subtlies with home whereabouts that are not captured in the spec


[11/11/2023 9:19 AM] .deciusmus
I changed the code to exclude the origin whereabout as the home whereabout if there were other home whereabouts in the file


[11/11/2023 9:20 AM] .deciusmus
so for example the spec, if you have:
- type home, no dates, location A
- type home, end date = 1720, location = B

Will report in 1721, a home of A instead of an origin of A and no home


[11/11/2023 9:22 AM] rsulfuratus
my code won't, because i count the number of homes and report origin if homes > 1


[11/11/2023 9:23 AM] rsulfuratus
so in this case i'd report origin and home


[11/11/2023 9:23 AM] rsulfuratus
because home A is assumed to be current


[11/11/2023 9:23 AM] .deciusmus
right but you should just report Origin


[11/11/2023 9:23 AM] .deciusmus

[11/11/2023 9:24 AM] .deciusmus
sorry that


[11/11/2023 9:24 AM] .deciusmus
should report:

Originally from: Or Place

and nothing else


[11/11/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't think your example has enough information to determine whether location A is origin, with no home, or whether location A is current home, with no origin


[11/11/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
unless we assume homes have to be entered in chronological order even without dates


[11/11/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
the data you describe could have been created from someone adding the new home to the top of the yaml, not the bottom


[11/11/2023 9:25 AM] .deciusmus
Right but I think the implication of the spec was that origin is the first home in the file


[11/11/2023 9:26 AM] .deciusmus
No matter what


[11/11/2023 9:26 AM] rsulfuratus
ah, okay


[11/11/2023 9:26 AM] .deciusmus
And  "home" is the *last* valid home in the file


[11/11/2023 9:27 AM] .deciusmus
If I delete the location: Or Place (but keep the end date on the home) it should report:

orginally from: home place 
if you are after the end date

and
based in: home place
if you are before the end date


[11/11/2023 9:28 AM] rsulfuratus
so home is last valid home in the file, but if home_count > 1 and origin == home then home is unknown


[11/11/2023 9:28 AM] .deciusmus
right


[11/11/2023 9:28 AM] .deciusmus
whereabouts if home_count = 1, then home = origin and we output only home


[11/11/2023 9:28 AM] rsulfuratus
i think the spec gets the correct home and origin but it is just a question of deciding which to output depending on value and home count


[11/11/2023 9:30 AM] rsulfuratus
if home_count == 1:
home = True and origin = False if home value is defined, otherwise origin = True and home = False


[11/11/2023 9:30 AM] rsulfuratus
logic is if home_count == 1, should always just output home unless home has an end date, implying no current home


[11/11/2023 9:31 AM] rsulfuratus
by definition if home_count == 1, origin and home must have the same value if both defined, so don't need to check


[11/11/2023 9:32 AM] rsulfuratus
if home_count > 1, we need to check if home and origin have the same value. 

if they have the same value, that means the only valid home is the origin, so we output origin True and home True but set home value to "Unknown"

if they have a different value, then we have a valid home and an origin, so set both to True and leave values unchanged


[11/11/2023 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
So I have a js function get_homeWhereabouts in the metadataUtils which returns the "home whereabouts" per the spec and then I make output decisions later


[11/11/2023 9:34 AM] .deciusmus
I updated that js function to return "undefined" if the home count > 1 and the home has no start or end date


[11/11/2023 9:34 AM] .deciusmus
that might be wrong though


[11/11/2023 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
i return a dict with value, output for each of current, home, origin, last known


[11/11/2023 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
where value is location and output is logical


[11/11/2023 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
(also has date so we can report last known date)


[11/11/2023 9:35 AM] .deciusmus
actually I didn't follow the spec for home at all


[11/11/2023 9:36 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I want to distinguish between "the home whereabout" and "I should output the home whereabout" because I want to write an Dataview table generator that shows everyone who's home is in a place


[11/11/2023 9:37 AM] .deciusmus
So I want the home to be "correctly" undefined if there home is not in the place,


[11/11/2023 9:37 AM] .deciusmus
Same for origin


[11/11/2023 9:37 AM] .deciusmus
So basically, I want my underlying JS code to return both home and origin if they are the same, and then my output code distinguishes


[11/11/2023 9:46 AM] .deciusmus
I never show "Home: unknown" - always blank if it isn't known


[11/11/2023 9:51 AM] rsulfuratus
can you push your testing notes?


[11/11/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/11/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus

[11/11/2023 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus

[11/11/2023 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
so far the filter option to remove %%^Date: and %%^Campaign blocks works, as does the dview convert. the yaml cleanup is not yet implemented


[11/11/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
I'm looking at tweaking how the Javascript get_CurrentWhereabouts works a bit


[11/11/2023 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
Because I want to have two different concepts:
(a) the current location of someone - is either (a) home or (b) exact or (c) unknown but never undefined
(b) the output of the "get_CurrentWhereabouts" which uses "is same" to decide what do to


[11/11/2023 11:07 AM] .deciusmus
So I was going to propose a tweak to the get_currentwhereabouts which is basically to say:

Get current location (as per the spec)
Get home location (as per the spec)
Get last known location (as per the spec)

Output:

if (current == home) return ""

if (last known)  output last known
output current


[11/11/2023 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
Wait that isn't correct.

We don't output last know if current is known


[11/11/2023 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus
my code has four things: last known, exact, home, and origin


[11/11/2023 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
So the logic is

if (current == home) output nothing & exit
if (current.location is deifned) output current & exit
if (current.location is not defined) output last known + current: unknown


[11/11/2023 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
My code doesn't care about exact


[11/11/2023 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah this is basically what i do


[11/11/2023 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
but this might be slightly cleaner


[11/11/2023 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
but not going to rewrite unless my implementation introduces bugs


[11/11/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I'm heading out for a hike in a bit, but one slight wrinkle


[11/11/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
Belagor testing page has this:

lastSeenByParty: 
 - { date: 1748-9-30, prefix: DuFr }
whereabouts:
     - { start: "", end: 1600, location: Ainumarya, type: home } #end is approx
     - { start: 1733-01-01, location: "Elderwood", type: away }
     - { start: 1748-08-15, location: "Te'kula village, Elderwood", type: away}


[11/11/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
the current code assumes that  location: "Te'kula village, Elderwood" is good only for 1748-08-15


[11/11/2023 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
so my "last seen by party" code generates "unknown"


[11/11/2023 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
hmmm


[11/11/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
so one option would be to treat this as a data entry problem, and just require an extra away line in that header


[11/11/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g.,
- { start: "", end: 1600, location: Ainumarya, type: home } #end is approx
- { start: 1733-01-01, location: "Elderwood", type: away }
- { start: 1748-08-15, end 1748-09-29, location: "Te'kula village, Elderwood", type: away}
- { start: 1748-09-30, location: "Te'kula village, Elderwood", type: away}


[11/11/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
that properly codes that we know he was in the village from 8-15 to 9-30 but don't know where he is after that


[11/11/2023 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
in this case as well, because there is no valid home, we could just set the end to 09-30 and leave off the last line


[11/11/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is simplest to treat the whereabouts as a list of known locations, and consider it a data entry error if lastSeenByParty generates an unknown line


[11/11/2023 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
there are going to be very few of these and it will be easy to correct because we know that last seen by party unknown must be an error


[11/11/2023 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
alternatively, you could add an explicit "unknown future" tag that, when present, treats end as unknown for the purposes of determining if someone returned home after the end of the whereabouts line


[11/11/2023 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think it is probably simpler to just stick with the logic of "defined end = returned home, undefined end = unknown future" and just duplicate away lines as needed


[11/11/2023 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, that's the conclusion I came to as well


[11/11/2023 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
The code I wrote will generate:

last seen by party @ date: unknown


[11/11/2023 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
which I think is accurate per the spec and clear enough signal that something is wrong

{Reactions}
👍

[11/11/2023 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
one last thing about setting metadata - I'm thinking adding default values to startPrefix, startStatus, endPrefix, endStatus, and preExistError in my metadata cleanup code, which would mean we could simplify the get_PageDatedValue function and be more flexible about not needing to define values for any possible type there (e.g., if we to add a created: 1700 to an organization and have it say "started: DR 1700")


[11/11/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
this would mean proliferation of file properties in obsidian, and would mean needing to set up templates to auto-generate default metadata for each type


[11/11/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but personally i think it is a lot cleaner and more flexible to rely on yaml frontmatter for these things


[11/11/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
and if i'm already going to reformat existing notes, may as well?


[11/11/2023 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
It just means when creating a new note you have a lot of work


[11/11/2023 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not against it but we need a template for a new note that sets it all


[11/11/2023 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
that is why it only works with templates


[11/11/2023 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
Oh I missed that line


[11/11/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I agree


[11/11/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly, maybe we should get rid of born/died and just use created/destroyed for everything


[11/11/2023 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
eh, not sure it matters too much, there is a lot of people vs non-people setup anyway so moving created/destroyed to 'core' doesn't change much


[11/11/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Sure


[11/11/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Although one note, I think the preexist error is not important


[11/11/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
I’d hardcode it to something


[11/11/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
It doesn’t really need to vary for different pages


[11/11/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
I am actually leaving to go to the fells now… but I pushed what should be working template for the header and js for current and home whereabouts

If I have time I want to 
- fix event table
- create a table of everyone in a certain place at a certain time
- everyone who lives in a certain place at a certain type
- everyone from a certain place


[11/11/2023 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
I also have some ideas around replacing the npc tags with something more friendly to programmatic manipulation so that I could create a table of all the npcs in Cleenseau the party knows about or has meet


[11/11/2023 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
can't you just use tag != NPC/Clee/unknown?


[11/11/2023 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah probably. Haven’t looked in detail. I’m just not sure the benefit of tags for that kind of thing


[11/11/2023 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah tags could change later if we have better things to do with them. i use them to sort npcs to work on, e.g., I have a table of npc/dufr/major and not status/uptodate


[11/11/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
Finally I was thinking about gazeetteer and thinking it might be nice to have a “parentLocation” so that it would be easier to find places inside places and so on. Although maybe that can be derived by folder structure


[11/11/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
So.. A few changes I am playing with, curious as to your thoughts:

1. Introduce "parentLocation" frontmatter tag and when getting a location, walk up the tree acculmulating. Currently I am only doing it when the input string has no comma.

So for example get_Location("Taviose") tries to get the file for Taviose, if it finds it, it gets the file for Taviose's parent location and so on. And then it outputs

Tavoise, Barony of Averil, Sembara

It will only go up 2 levels

[11/11/2023 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
I find it very nice to be able to type bare strings for locations, i.e. just "Cleenseau" or "Tollen" or "Tokra" or whatever


[11/11/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
so, that seems nice, but with my current python code will be impossible to implement. all i track is the metadata of the current file and the names of all files in the dir+subdirs


[11/11/2023 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
you are presuambly able to do this fairly easily because you can get the tags for an arbitrary file with dataview api


[11/11/2023 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
theoretically it could be possible to run my code on all files, get a dict of file -> metadata, and then write a loc lookup function


[11/11/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
well, the raw obisidan API, but yes


[11/11/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
let fm = window.app.metadataCache.getFileCache(file).frontmatter


[11/11/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
but you shouldn't need to do that. it doesn't need to be fast


[11/11/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Just write a function that takes a file path and returns the value of the parentLocation from the file path


[11/11/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. by reading the file's yaml


[11/11/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
ah hmm there is this:

[11/11/2023 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
right now I don't have a separate function to read frontmatter, i just grab it when i read the file


[11/11/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right you'd have to extract your file loading code. Or just use obsidian tools which looks like it would give you the same basic API obsidian has


[11/11/2023 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, the obsidian tools has a get frontmatter and get source text so i could dump all my parsing text...and also has a get plain text which would be quite useful for generating material to input into chatgpt


[11/11/2023 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
might refactor to use that which would make a lot of things easier. if it reads inline tags could even make event stuff manageable


[11/11/2023 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
inline tags are a dataview feature not an obsidian feature, I think


[11/11/2023 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah there is an open issue in the obsidiantools repo marked as enhancement to implement dataview....


[11/11/2023 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm working on metadata cleanup and am almost ready to deploy


[11/11/2023 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
however, noticing an issue, when we encoded origin as start=born-01-01 and home as start=born-01-02


[11/11/2023 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
if you remove the start=born-01-01, things work correctly


[11/11/2023 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
i could check to see if the start=born for metadata cleanup and remove start in that case


[11/11/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
but wondering if there is a reason why that would cause problems elsewhere


[11/11/2023 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure what you mean


[11/11/2023 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
You mean, would removing start from lines that have start = born-01-01 or start=born-01-02 ?


[11/11/2023 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
if start == born-01-01 set start to ""


[11/11/2023 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense to


[11/11/2023 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
*to me


[11/11/2023 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
we are about to go out for dinner, but the other thing I was thinking about was clarifying the types of files and metadata spec...

It would be useful to have a template for creating / adding yaml to each type of file...

(a) PC
(b) NPC
(c) Ruler
(d) Event
(e) Item
(f) Building
(g) Location
(h) Organization
(i) Holiday


[11/11/2023 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
maybe "Timeline"


[11/11/2023 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
my metadata cleanup code is kind of hacky but the way it works is creates a blank metadata with all the expected values for a type, then parses the actual metadata into the expected values based on various rules, then exports the new metadata with empty values for those without info


[11/11/2023 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
it is pretty easy to change and run with different types and metadata specs


[11/11/2023 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right now i'm going to clean up at least the people directory because of how messy the whereabouts is


[11/11/2023 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but it would be fairly easy to change the code to clean up to any arbitrary spec


[11/11/2023 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
and also would be easy to write a function to guess type based on folder, json, or something else


[11/11/2023 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is probably better to have:

An obisidian template the creates a specific metadata for a type
An obsidian template (in javascript using templater) that figures out type based on folder and inserts
A Python script that cleans up existing data


[11/11/2023 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
So when you have a blank page you can just do

ALT-N or whatever and it inserts the probably right YAML for the folder

Or you can run the specific template you want
Or if we change stuff we can rerun the python script to cleanup


[11/11/2023 4:55 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes, the python script is just for wholesale cleanup of entire folders


[11/11/2023 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a branch with massive metadata cleanup


[11/11/2023 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly affects people as things with undefined type just get copied over


[11/12/2023 9:28 AM] .deciusmus
Not much time to look at this today as I’m running my game this afternoon


[11/12/2023 9:29 AM] .deciusmus
But I was wondering if it would be possible to format with {} instead of lists, ie

{ location: x, type: home }


[11/12/2023 9:29 AM] .deciusmus
The updated metadata takes a lot of space in the file


[11/12/2023 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
My obsidian is set to in source mode so I see the yaml frontmatter and it is kinda annoying to have the body of the note so far down


[11/12/2023 9:30 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah i was messing with the formatting a bit, i'm using a yaml dumper package so I need to figure out how to control the output better


[11/12/2023 9:31 AM] .deciusmus
It looks like it has a flow style parameter


[11/12/2023 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
I assume this is what you are using https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation


[11/12/2023 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
The size of frontmatter was also making me reconsider the endStatus/prefix/etc


[11/12/2023 9:33 AM] rsulfuratus
no i'm using the default yaml package in base python. might need to switch to pyYAML for better control


[11/12/2023 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
oh, actually, i am using pyyaml, nvm


[11/12/2023 9:35 AM] .deciusmus
I think if you set default_flow_style = true it should get closer to what we want. 
I also think the set of empty frontmatter should be small


[11/12/2023 9:36 AM] .deciusmus
Ie don’t add everything in with empty values


[11/12/2023 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
i think it might make sense to collapse some stuff that doesn't need to be human readable easily into lists, e.g. could have a defaults frontmatter item (dict or list) that is auto-generated (by template or python) with all the various default text. would only take up one line of frontmatter


[11/12/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
and could easily extend to other defaults if desired


[11/12/2023 9:37 AM] .deciusmus
Right that’s not a bad idea


[11/12/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
i also was working on implemented an "optional/required" flag, where empty optional items are not output. so far this is just ka is only output for elves but could easily be extended to anything


[11/12/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
Do you have a source config somewhere for this?


[11/12/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
Where does the metadata list live?


[11/12/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
it is horrible, it is just a function that defines a metadata dict in the python code. but i will at some point (probably thanksgiving week, which i'm taking off) rewrite to parse a spec


[11/12/2023 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
If you make it a json file I’d write a templater that generates the new note from that


[11/12/2023 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
Could even have 2 templates one for minimal and one for all


[11/12/2023 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
the way i have it set up now is that i create a few dicts with different keys, combined them by type (so, e.g., NPC = core + people, Ruler = core + people + ruler, PC = core + people + PC), and then set defaults by type


[11/12/2023 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
I wasn't sure the best way to define this in json


[11/12/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
it would be trivial to have like 10 json files, and then do the combining and default-setting in code


[11/12/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah I’d have one json file per type plus a core


[11/12/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
And people


[11/12/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
Or rather, I’d have a set of “metadata” files like core,
Person, etc


[11/12/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
And then a single file that defines for each type which metadata files to use


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess you could do the default setting in the json if you just don't put things in core that have variable defaults by type


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. the defaults list could be part of the most-specific json


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
that would be easy too


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
I’d do the default in json and not put something like the end status in core. Just put it wherever


[11/12/2023 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/12/2023 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
you'd need a separate file to define which metadata is combined for which type, and also to define which elements are always output (even if blank) and which are only output if not blank


[11/12/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
although i guess the latter might be better as a spec that can be implemented separately in cleanup code and in templater


[11/12/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
the workflow would then be:
1. run cleanup code to make all notes conform to spec
2. use templater for new notes, ideally never running cleanup
3. if spec changes, update cleanup code and rerun to convert all notes to new spec


[11/12/2023 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/12/2023 9:50 AM] .deciusmus
I’d make it as data driven as possible, ie have a json file that defines:
Type -> metadata
And each metadata file has:
{ name: , outputIfEmpty: , default:


[11/12/2023 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
You might want to output died even if blank for rulers (most rulers are dead) but not for npcs and PCs for@example


[11/12/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that's fine


[11/12/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
how annoying would it be to parse defaults that refer to variables in templater / javascript? e.g.:
```
name : { required; True, default: <file-name> }
```


[11/12/2023 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
Not annoying


[11/12/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
where required implies "always-output" and the `<>` syntax would mean "replace with a variable of this name if exists"


[11/12/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
okay, that seems like the best option then


[11/12/2023 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
I’m not sure the point of something like replace name with filename though


[11/12/2023 9:57 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe not


[11/12/2023 9:58 AM] rsulfuratus
that specific example


[11/12/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
but could be used for example to implement your folder -> ancestry map, for example, if that was useful


[11/12/2023 10:00 AM] .deciusmus
My view on metadata is that is serves 3 purposes:
1. To be used by the header generation template to generate consistent Wikipedia style bio-blocks
2. To by used by the dynamic dataview/python code for whereabouts, page dated value, and regnal year
3. For dataview queries


[11/12/2023 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/12/2023 10:01 AM] .deciusmus
Anything that is used by (2) we should prefer having defaults in yaml. So that there is a single source of truth. But for (1) it is perhaps nicer to have the default logic in JavaScript


[11/12/2023 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus
for new notes, sure


[11/12/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
I just mean, we should in general try to prefer smaller rather than larger frontmatter


[11/12/2023 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
Anyway I gotta go shopping before my D&D game and still have three tower levels in the hobgoblin fort to make up, so can continue this later but not right now

[11/12/2023 10:05 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not going to do any coding on this until next weekend most likely anyway


[11/12/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
Speaking of my game today, any thoughts on holy symbols for the Father and the Night Queen?
Thinking for the father:
Simplest - a line with a circle with rays  on top, representing a scepter with the sun at the top. More complex would include details of scepter sun

Night queen - five dots in a circle, representing the outline of a crown of stars. More complex would represent the crown (seen top down). Alternate sometimes seen: just three stars in an arch with an implied horizon, representing transition to and from the night/life/death


[11/12/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
I like both of those. for night queen perhaps stylized stars not dots? as an amulet or holy symbol assume it would be a styled crown in general


[11/12/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah. Sounds good


[11/12/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
In this case it will come up scrawled on walls as graffiti / ward against undead


[11/12/2023 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
btw, here is the history of a ruined villa in western Cymea that is the setting for my game tonight
The Perdoli Manor (*Pehr-DOH-lee*) was build in 1479, by the wealthy Perdoli family, merchants and traders. Got rich off wine and control over a marble quarry in the hills, built manor as a place to relax and get away, about a day's journey into the hills from Vistalba. 

The family enjoyed the manor for several generations, until the Great War. The Perdoli family faired poorly, and came out of the Great War having lost much of their wealth (details don't really matter). A few years after the Great War, forced to sell the villa. The new owners were not much better, and never lived there, and couldn't afford the upkeep. Some stone was scavenged during this time, but it was too far away to be convenient. The new owners died without heirs, living the manor to fall into disrepair and ruin in the 1590s. 

It stood empty save from occasional wandering travelers seeking shelter far from home for the next 30 years or so, generally falling out of memory of the local villagers, who had other problems to deal with. 

In the 1620s, the manor was reoccupied by a medusa, who made it her lair for 30 years, during which time it acquired a reputation as a cursed place, and fell further into disrepair. The medusa eventually succumbed to her reflection, caught unexpectedly by the water in a fountain. While she lived there, some crude repairs were made to the manor, scavenging stone from outbuildings as needed. 

In the 1690s, a group of pirates and bandits fleeing the beginnings of Tollender persecution moved in and made it a hideaway for the next 15 years or so. They dug tunnels and built a secret room behind the wine cellar to store treasure, and repaired the smithy/forge and parts of the manor, in a crude fashion. The leader was killed by the Tollender Navy in the 1720s, and the lair was gradually abandoned. 

It has sat empty since then, until recent events.


[11/12/2023 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
It’s dungeon crawl day in Taelgar


[11/12/2023 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/12/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
Do you have any issue with lots of undead across sembara in the winter of 1720, btw? Like 10s of skeletons and zombies appearing in lots of little villages and towns across a wide swath of southern sembara.


[11/12/2023 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
sounds great


[11/12/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
The lich cast some spell that awakened say, 0.01% of all the dead in sembara


[11/12/2023 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
i keep thinking that you all should go find someone who remembers the lich in sembara to ask about how to kill liches


[11/12/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
That would be a good idea but none of us know about the lich


[11/12/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
right, i need a way to introduce it. maybe when you get back to tollen


[11/12/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I mean you could tell Wellby he remembers from his childhood


[11/12/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's true, i guess it was probably a pretty big deal when the lich was exposed?


[11/12/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah. It’s going to be summer 1720


[11/12/2023 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
So like a year or two before he was born. But a big deal for everyone in the region


[11/12/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
I have no idea how the lich was defeated. It doesn’t matter actually since the PCs will not be involved. All I know is that a human woman paladin or fighter (who was involved in the backstory of one of my PCs) is part of it


[11/12/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm, yeah, i'll think a bit. even if i introduce in game those details wouldn't matter for several sessions, as presumably you'd need to get back to tollen and ask around. all wellby would remember is there was a lich who was killed


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
The only other thing is that the lich wasn’t actually killed. Just everyone thought he was killed. In reality he ended up trapped by mind flayers in a complex plot


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
But that plot is canonically secret, ie even if my players fail no one in sembara would reallly know about it


[11/12/2023 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/12/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
But that won’t be remotely relevant to my game until summer 2024 at the very soonest


[11/12/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
And I don’t have well plotted details


[11/12/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
So I have lots of flexibility to let whatever comes up in dunmar game to be canonical as long as it’s possible to somehow have the lich re-emerge later. It could be even not the actual lich, but something related to him. 

The only plot I’m committed to is underdark/mind flayers vibe as the bad guys plus the necessity to run all over sembara region to find info/items/legends/something


[11/12/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
And that I want the lich prologue that’s running now to be connected to the “main plot” so the lich has to be involved somehow


[11/12/2023 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
the idea is that the mind flayers are somehow in control of the lich, or the lich is in control of the mind flayers? or you haven't decided?


[11/12/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
Haven’t decided


[11/12/2023 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
My original idea was that the mind flayers were in control of the lichs phylatcertry and when he was “killed” instead of letting him come back to life they imprisoned him with the idea of using his undeath to fuel a chaylyte golem that would be functionally unstopped and kill everyone


[11/12/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
But I’m not committed to that - all I’m committed to is
A) mind flayers under the Sentinel Ranger 
B) who are doing something bad
C) related to the lich in some fashion
D) where to solve the problem the PCs have to go to a bunch of different places in greater sembara


[11/12/2023 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
btw - it might be too late for your game today or not relevant - but I made up the elf from our last session thinking they could be a chararacter who could show up in your game.

Traveled and fought with the rangers for a time, spent time around Massau, Addermarch, fighting hobgoblins, until by 1700 was tired of fighting. Had amassed some considerable skill in arms, and favors and knowledge from a wide swath of people, including many rangers. Word of their deeds spread, and returns to Orenlas - which is particularly close to Addermarch - in the early 1700s, tired, feeling out of cycle, uncertain about having missed their first mela, wanting the strength of Aldanor's roots just as Elmerca's winds are scattering the newly awakened elves of the small and uncertain 37th ka. Decides to stay in Orenlas. Given their fame, attracts a number of gifts, and finds particular joy in painting. Even has one of Beryl's paintings, a very rare piece if not particularly amazingly crafted, and a gift from the Rangers.

messing around a bit with metadata ideas some more. pushed a few updates to metadata spec mostly with some thoughts, on the clean_metadata branch


[11/13/2023 4:55 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly, feels like people is pretty clear, but other types are not


[11/13/2023 4:56 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure the repo is the best place to think through ideas though


[11/13/2023 4:58 PM] rsulfuratus
in particular, we have a lot of different types of notes in gazetteer, including specific buildings, settlements, geographic features, culture/politics, civilizations/kingdoms (which overlap but don't totally encompass culture), big regions, etc


[11/13/2023 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
I was also messing around a bit.

This:

```dataviewjs
const { metadataUtils } = customJS

await dv.view("_scripts/view/get_PersonTable", {     
    header: ["Location", "Name", "Born"],
    map: p => [p.currentLocation, p.name, p.life.startDate?.display ?? "unknown" ],
    where: p => metadataUtils.inLocation("Dunmar", p.file.frontmatter)
} )
```

Generates this:

For everyone with 
(a) proper whereabouts data
(b) where they are currently in Dunmar


[11/13/2023 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
did you push to the clean_metadata branch?


[11/13/2023 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
Here is the current location of everyone who is from the feywild

[11/13/2023 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yes pushed to clean_metadata


[11/13/2023 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
did you push that script? i don't see it on either branch


[11/13/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
no, haven't pushed


[11/13/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
there is a moderately serious memory leak of some kind


[11/13/2023 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
paste it into chatgpt and ask it to find the memory leak


[11/13/2023 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
branch  js_refactor


[11/13/2023 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
I added a few main things:

1. On timeline generation, if the frontmatter has a timelineDescriptor it inserts it as *(timelineDescripter)* in the event text


[11/13/2023 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
2. The events table generation now works with/requires new metadata


[11/13/2023 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
3. The aforementioned get_PersonTable

We should probably just pick a language and call python from JavaScript or vice versa (https://blog.logrocket.com/exploring-jspybridge-library-python-javascript/#importing-javascript-file-python-different-directory)

[11/13/2023 7:02 PM] rsulfuratus
for calculating location, is this supposed to report Tollen as current location?

```
whereabouts:
- type: home
  start: ''
  end: ''
  location: At Sea, Western Gulf
- type: home
  start: 1722
  end: ''
  location: Tollen, Western Green Sea
```


[11/13/2023 7:02 PM] rsulfuratus
currently does not, at least not based on your location script


[11/13/2023 7:02 PM] .deciusmus
As long as the date is after 1722


[11/13/2023 7:02 PM] .deciusmus
There are some bugs


[11/13/2023 7:03 PM] .deciusmus
Also I’m not sure if end:’’ is handling perfectly everywhere as opposed to end : undefined


[11/13/2023 7:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i think my python code is less buggy than your java code, at least for the whereabouts info box calculation


[11/13/2023 7:05 PM] rsulfuratus
😛


[11/13/2023 7:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that page displays properly if I convert it


[11/13/2023 7:07 PM] rsulfuratus
however based on that link it looks like it might be easier to use javascript functions in python than vice versa


[11/13/2023 7:07 PM] .deciusmus
Which thing is not displaying correctly? I was rewriting stuff to handle the “inLocation” code better

Originally from: Sembara, Western Green Sea
Based in: Tollen, Western Green Sea


[11/13/2023 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah. I think there is a stable-sort bug I didn’t fix


[11/13/2023 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
What if you remove the start date


[11/13/2023 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that works


[11/13/2023 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
it also works if you have an end in the first home


[11/13/2023 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
That is, JavaScript is basically the worst language in the world and array.sort() isn’t stable. So I fixed the logic in one case but not all of them


[11/13/2023 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
“Stable” means it keeps the input order for the same keys


[11/13/2023 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway..


[11/13/2023 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
AFK for a bit


[11/13/2023 7:32 PM] rsulfuratus
so, looking at https://github.com/extremeheat/JSPyBridge some more...

[11/13/2023 7:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i think there is a core of something that could work there


[11/13/2023 7:34 PM] rsulfuratus
the problem is that the javascript code relies a lot on the obsidian api and the dataviewjs api, and i'm not sure if it is possible to import those into python


[11/13/2023 7:35 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, the basic set of metadata utils might be easier to code and maintain in python. python at least seems like a much simpler language to handle e.g. dates and some of the sorting stuff


[11/13/2023 7:37 PM] rsulfuratus
however, that particular package relies on node.js so i have no idea if that is even functional in obsidian


[11/13/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
theoretically I think the idea would be to have a core set of metadata processing functions written in python, e.g.:
pass metadata, get current whereabouts
pass metadata, get origin whereabouts
pass metadata, get age


[11/13/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
then, separately code functions in python or javascript to use that information


[11/13/2023 7:53 PM] rsulfuratus
things that are basic reformatting are easy to code in either and there is probably no reason to try to synchronize


[11/13/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
to export things that require parsing the vault would either require a way to call the obsidian and dataviewjs apis from python, or an alternate approach to get the same kind of information


[11/13/2023 7:54 PM] .deciusmus
Dataview provides a lot of stuff; going to be hard to do via python


[11/13/2023 7:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yes. anything that only requires the information about the current page metadata is straightforward to replicate in python given a core set of functions that return information from metadata


[11/13/2023 7:56 PM] rsulfuratus
anything that requires querying the vault as a database is quite tricky and probably requires finding someone else who has done the coding


[11/13/2023 8:02 PM] .deciusmus
The main problem with Python is that everything has to be wrapped in JS


[11/13/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
It's fine to have like a core Python "get whereabouts state" or "get page existence state" that returns back and object, but to do all the various dynamic bits needs JS functoins


[11/13/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
So I could see, for example, an architecture working where you have a core python lib that returns, for a given page, some set of data like the current/last known/home/origin whereabouts, the regnalData, and the page Existence data

And then the JS functions for Dataview could wrap those


[11/13/2023 8:06 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. 

```
    inLocation(targetLocation, metadata, targetDate) {
  
        if (!targetDate) targetDate = this.get_pageEventsDate(metadata)
        let current = this.get_currentWhereabouts(metadata, targetDate);
        if (current == undefined || current.location == undefined || current.location == "Unknown") {      
            return false;
        }

        let found = this.locationSearch(current.location, targetLocation)
        return found;
    }
```

could be somethng like

```
inLocation(targetLocation, metadata, targetDate) {
    let whereabouts = pyLib.getWhereaboutsForPage(metadata, targetDate)
     let current = whereabouts.current
....
```


[11/13/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that is what I was imaging


[11/13/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
python just handles metadata in, object out


[11/13/2023 8:08 PM] rsulfuratus
that simplifies debugging and maintanence for basic info boxes


[11/13/2023 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't help with the more fundamental issue about web export. to me, a lot of this metadata stuff feels extremely useful for session prep, information cleanup, and other tracking stuff. but it feels quite challenging to figure out how to incorporate into the webpage


[11/13/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn't really worrying about that


[11/13/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
I like seeing it for session prep and fun


[11/13/2023 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
and info cleanup


[11/13/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
The only architecture that is likely to work for export is something that captures the rendered data in obsidian


[11/13/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
reimplementing dataview isn't realistic I don't think


[11/13/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus

[11/13/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
But I bet that is focused on the simple dataview stuff, not dataview JS


[11/13/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
it looks like it is pretty easy to, for example, get all the notes with the event-source tag, and a DR tag between 1600 and 1700


[11/13/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
so that is a decent bit of the way there


[11/13/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't implement the task/list tags


[11/13/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
as far as I can see


[11/13/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
right, but that isn't that close to what dataviewJs lets you do


[11/13/2023 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/13/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
my get_EventsTable is doing a **lot** more than that


[11/13/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
obviously. i think at the moment i'm more interested in getting the basic metadata functions really solid and making sure the python export can handle info boxes smoothly, as well as figuring out the metadata structure for more complex things like places, than solving the web export issue for dataviewjs, which I think is your feeling too


[11/13/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/13/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
Although I'm also interested in learning a bit of javascript and having the tools to rapidly prototype various types of dynamic exploration of the data


[11/13/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
it wouldn't take that much fiddling to clean up metadataUtils.py to make it something that could theoretically be imported into Javascript


[11/13/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
I think it would need to be a little differently structured


[11/13/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
but.. it would be doable


[11/13/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
maybe I should learn python instead of Javascript


[11/13/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
well someone needs to know javascript


[11/13/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so looking at the JSPyBridge some more, I think what you'd want is a python function returns all the computed variables on a metadata object, right? 

e.g., in python, you have:
```python
def get_computed_metadata(metadata):
    # code goes here
    return computed_dict
```

then, in Javascript:
```javascript
import { python } from 'pythonia'
const computeMetadata = await python('./metadataUtils.py')
computed_metadata = await {computeMetadata.get_computed_metadata(metadata)
```


[11/13/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
well, maybe


[11/13/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
probably; you'd just want it relatively well structured


[11/13/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
there are also some grey areas .. is the "current" location computed or not


[11/13/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i would consider that computed


[11/13/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, the ideal would be to compute a bunch of stuff...

* Current whereabout
* Last known whereabout
* Home whereabout
* Origin whereabout
* Start / End date
* Age
* Is Alive
* Is Existing
* etc


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think your current code actually computes those all correctly though


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i haven't yet found a page that my current code doesn't correctly compute, but i haven't checked everything


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
there could be edge cases


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
Well, I mean, I think it is correct to the spec


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
But its the wrong


[11/13/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
wrong model


[11/13/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
"current" should be undefined for dead people, for example


[11/13/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
"last known" should potentially be home, if that is the last known place


[11/13/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
a few other similar things


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i do check when people died, and correctly report nothing for current location


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i was not positive what to do with last known


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i played around with setting last known to location when died, but that is not technically last known if it was an away location


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right I don't mean your dview is wrong, I mean the metadataUtil doen't have the right level of data


[11/13/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
right spec, whatever


[11/13/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
my parse metadata code does a little too much for one function. i am pretty sure the exact, home, origin, and last locations are correct, but it is probably better to allow a different function to decide what to output when instead of trying to overload that on the same function


[11/13/2023 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
it relies on setting output to false instead of updating location in some cases, which isn't as correct as you'd want for something you can pass back and forth


[11/13/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
It does assume the whereabouts are sorted by date


[11/13/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
Which is probably reasonable


[11/13/2023 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
at least if I am reading the python correctly it does 🙂


[11/13/2023 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
who knows?


[11/13/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
it only assumes this for home without dates


[11/13/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
or at least it should only assume for homes without dates


[11/13/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway the exact details don't matter, it is relatively feasible to update this code to return whatever is useful for the javascript if you want to try to use it in javascript, or alternatively to have a wrapper function to generate a formatted dict however the javascript code wants it


[11/13/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm actually more interested in figuring out location metadata than fiddling with code sychronization


[11/13/2023 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/13/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
That’s reasonable


[11/13/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
although i am adding a bit of documentation and cleanup to my code right now


[11/13/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
will push in a bi


[11/13/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
*bit


[11/13/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
did you look at my location musings in the metadata spec?


[11/13/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
As far as metadata, for places in general I’m not sure the point in distinguishing much


[11/13/2023 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
right maybe you just need one place type with a bunch of optional fields


[11/13/2023 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Why not just have “partOf” and “location” ? Otherwise the created / destroyed  is optional


[11/13/2023 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Im a little skeptical of population


[11/13/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
But maybe worth having to help with a standardized header block. But I’m actually not sure there is much benefit to a standard header


[11/13/2023 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing that I want to do is move all the pronounciation stuff to metadata, so I can easily make a dataview query for how to pronounce everything - it's a big pain having to click over to each note


[11/13/2023 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
Yes


[11/13/2023 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
Agree with that


[11/13/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but I also want it in the header of the note, so in that case having a standardized header, even if it is just:
```
# Name
*(pronounciation)*
```


[11/13/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
might be worthwhile


[11/13/2023 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
you also might want to generate a standard "x of y"


[11/13/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
I also want to have standard headers for my session notes although I don’t know if you want to bother


[11/13/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., 
```
# Gold Street
a ward of [[Tollen]]
```


[11/13/2023 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/13/2023 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Although isn’t that easy enough to type?


[11/13/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
if it is just one layer, sure


[11/13/2023 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
if you are doing: [[Tollen]], [[Tollen partOf]]


[11/13/2023 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
then you want a template I think


[11/13/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
But do you really want:
# The Crossroads Inn
an inn in [[Cleenseau]], [[Averil]], [[Sembara]]


[11/13/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe you do?


[11/13/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd probably only go two levels up


[11/13/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe three levels


[11/13/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
three levels might be overkill for display


[11/13/2023 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
I guess you could have:

- partOf
- placeType
- population


[11/13/2023 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
- name


[11/13/2023 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I was going to say I would like placeType for sure. my DM notes for the Tollen sessions were a lot of copying and pasting of things and embedding notes, it would be a lot faster if I could just do a dataview query for wards of Tollen


[11/13/2023 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
And then generate

# <Name>
(Pronunciation)
A <placeType> in <partOf>
(Population) / getPageDatedValue


[11/13/2023 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd do:


[11/13/2023 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
A <placeType> in <partOf>, <partOfParent>


[11/13/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
Right I meant “partOf” to be 2 levels up

{Reactions}
👍

[11/13/2023 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the other question is whether we want to have tags for specific levels of organization. e.g., I saw you using cultureDescriptor to tag the page a specific ancestry links to


[11/13/2023 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
I actually don’t like that. I’d rather have something in metadata.json I think that defines page names for species and cultures


[11/13/2023 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
I like keeping the frontmatter simpler


[11/13/2023 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
So I’d say the header should be:

As is for people / rulers
As above for locations (anything with type - Location)
Items tbd
Anything else will be just
# name 
(Pronounciation)


[11/13/2023 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
okay. I might then run my metadata cleanup one more time and do the following:
- convert the startStatus, endStatus stuff into a displayDefaults dict with sensible defaults per type
- output a very short list of required metadata (that is output even if blank): tags, displayDefaults, born/species/ancestry/gender for People; reignEnd/reignStart/died for rulers; placeType, partOf for locations


[11/13/2023 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
Just don’t make reignEnd default to anything

{Reactions}
👍

[11/13/2023 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
and type of course


[11/13/2023 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
I mess around with death dates it is a pain to have to change reignEnd


[11/13/2023 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
valid types will be: 
- Ruler
- NPC


[11/13/2023 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
It should be optional / not output

{Reactions}
👍

[11/13/2023 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
so just born/species/ancestry/gender for all people, nothing extra for rulers?


[11/13/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
ReignStart for rulers

{Reactions}
👍

[11/13/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
On the display status stuff, I think it’s fine but I’d drop the pre-exist error


[11/13/2023 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
valid types would be:

People:
- Ruler
- NPC
- PC

Organization
Location
Item
SessionNote

Events:
- Event
- Holiday (maybe)
- Timeline (maybe)


[11/13/2023 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
might not even need Events as a type...


[11/13/2023 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
I would not bother with a type for event vs holiday vs timeline


[11/13/2023 9:58 PM] rsulfuratus
is there even any reason to have an Event type at all?


[11/13/2023 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
No, I don’t think so


[11/13/2023 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
The only reason I can see to have type is to customized the generated header


[11/13/2023 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
For selecting it is better to have tags. 

It could be sensible to have some default tags:
- person
- place 
- event


[11/13/2023 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
- timeline
- sessionNote
- item


[11/13/2023 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
tag organiation is a whole separate issue


[11/13/2023 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
We could even just get rid of type and do tags.contains(person)


[11/13/2023 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
But maybe not something to consider right now


[11/13/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
Btw I was messing around with the idea of changing lastSeenByParty to something like:
partyKnowledge and allowing prefixes without dates


[11/13/2023 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
the only problem with tags is it gets a bit much to overload so much information onto them. for example it might be more useful to have a "campaign status" instead of using tags


[11/13/2023 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
I see you suggested the same thing


[11/13/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
Then I could do dataview queries that would do something like:
All people who DuFr is aware of


[11/13/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
I’d rather use tags for selection


[11/13/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
Not organization


[11/13/2023 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
Ie passing “#person” as a filter to data view


[11/13/2023 10:03 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/13/2023 10:03 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe a campaign info metadata field would be better


[11/13/2023 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. I like to keep track of the importance of NPCs because it is a useful filter for what to work on


[11/13/2023 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
but you could have campaignInfo -> dufr -> "major" or something


[11/13/2023 10:04 PM] .deciusmus
That could make sense as a tag, actually


[11/13/2023 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I guess it doesn't need to be campaign specific


[11/13/2023 10:04 PM] .deciusmus
You want to use tags for things you want ad-hoc queries on


[11/13/2023 10:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I do have maybe two NPCs who are major in one campaign and background or minor in another...


[11/13/2023 10:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but generally that distinction doesn't really matter


[11/13/2023 10:05 PM] rsulfuratus
how does dataview handle hierarchical tags?


[11/13/2023 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't like all the clutter on the tag browser from having a million disorganized tags


[11/13/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
i.e.

If you want to rapidly throw together a page of NPCs who are important to DuFr who live in Dunmar, because we are heading back there and you want to make sure up to date, doing something like

get_PersonTable("#DuFr/major and #person", f => metautils.inLocation(f, "Dunmar")

seems useful


[11/13/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly, if I was redoing everything, I would actually propose getting rid of type entirely and just use tags.

I'd start with the "main" tags:
* person
* PC
* ruler
* item
* place
* event
* timeline
* sessionNote


[11/13/2023 10:08 PM] .deciusmus
then I'd have the idea of campaign importance tags (which could apply to anything):
* prefix/major
* prefix/background
* prefix/minor


[11/13/2023 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so it would be trivial to add all these tags to metadata


[11/13/2023 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I was wondering about e.g., if you have #place, can you add #place/settlement and have #place get both #place and #place/settlement, while #place/settlement gets only #place/settlement


[11/13/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
I don't know


[11/13/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
but how often do you care?


[11/13/2023 10:11 PM] .deciusmus
I'd rather have a PC have 
tags: [ person, PC ]

then

tags: [person/PC ]


[11/13/2023 10:11 PM] .deciusmus
and hope that #person matches both


[11/13/2023 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that is a fairly simple case


[11/13/2023 10:12 PM] .deciusmus
although I just tested, it does work


[11/13/2023 10:12 PM] .deciusmus
so nesting is certainly feasible


[11/13/2023 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I am more thinking for campaign stuff


[11/13/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and for negative queries, e.g. if I want all the stuff that does not have a status tag


[11/13/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
I think I would say that:

(campaignPrefix/*) 

is undefined


[11/13/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
I might not want to do the same things as well


[11/13/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
as you


[11/13/2023 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure I quite get your point. hierachies under the campaginPrefix would be exclusively for dataview queries and such, you wouldn't use them for frontmatter or headers


[11/13/2023 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
The real question is:

* person, person/PC, person/ruler OR person, PC, ruler
* place, place/settlement, place/country, place/river OR place, river, settlement, country

etc


[11/13/2023 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
What I mean is your metadata cleanup shouldn't assume anything about campaign tags


[11/13/2023 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, yes, okay, that makes sense


[11/13/2023 10:16 PM] .deciusmus
And for example, a newly created NPC shouldn't have

tags: [NPC/DuFr/unsorted, NPC/Clee/unsorted, NPC/GL/unsorted]

or whatever


[11/13/2023 10:16 PM] .deciusmus
"unsorted" for DuFr would just be "!#DuFr"


[11/13/2023 10:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yes exactly


[11/13/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
if you then wanted ot add a [DuFr/unaware] to my NPCs that is fine


[11/13/2023 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
But separately, I was proposing a proper, not-tag-based, mechanism to track campaign info


[11/13/2023 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I do sometimes use the tab browser, and it is pretty annoying if it gets extremely cluttered. so for that reason I'd probably lean towards nested tags


[11/13/2023 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, they are more annoying to type if they get more than 2 deep


[11/13/2023 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think a good mechanism would not necessarily be super-strict


[11/13/2023 10:21 PM] .deciusmus
So replace

lastSeenByParty 

with

campaignInfo:
- { campaign: (a prefix), date: (a date, optional), type: (a string, optional) }

This would do 2 things:

1. The "last seen by party" template header output would continue to be generated
2. I'd add some mechanism so that you could do something like:

util.campaignStatus("prefix", "type")
util.isKnownToCampaign("prefix")

This would make it easy to generate place or NPC tables that contain only those places, NPCs, etc that a party knows about


[11/13/2023 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be great


[11/13/2023 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
so for example if you had:

- { campaign: DuFr,  date: 1748-01-01, type: met }
- { campaign: DuFr,  date: 1748-05-01, type: scryed }

It would generate:

* Last met by party (on 1748-01-01): (location)
* Last scryed by party (on 1748-05-01): (location)

Obviously rare to bother with that level of detail, but it could build up esp in my game where it is not that hard to add that stuff over time


[11/13/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
Then, additionally, if "isKnownToCampaign" returns true if there is any matching entry either with no date or with a date in the past


[11/13/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
and CampaignStatus returns true if a matching type is no date or in past


[11/13/2023 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so one thing I am eventually going to write is some code to grab the last time an NPC was mentioned in session notes and backfill all the campaignInfo


[11/13/2023 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
so the 95% case could just be:

campaignInfo: [ { campaign: DuFr} ]

that means that DuFr knows about this NPC or place, no one else does


[11/13/2023 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
the 4% case could be:

campaignInfo: [ { campaign: DuFr, date: somedate } ]

and then the 1% case could be the actually complicated where you have different dates for met vs scryed vs contacted or whatever


[11/13/2023 10:26 PM] rsulfuratus
that is pretty nice.


[11/13/2023 10:30 PM] rsulfuratus
so to update:
1. delete endStatus, startPrefix, endPrefix, etc and create displayDefaults instead
2. delete lastSeenByParty and create campaignInfo instead
3. delete type and instead add relevant tag (person, place, thing, etc, with for now person/pc and person/ruler)
4. delete blank metadata except for a small handful of key things: tags, name, born/species/ancestry/gender for people, player for PC, reignStart for rulers, partOf, placeType for locations


[11/13/2023 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/13/2023 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
what about dates?


[11/13/2023 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
obviously DR stays; as does DR-end


[11/13/2023 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
fc-date and fc-end as well


[11/13/2023 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
realWorldDate


[11/13/2023 10:32 PM] .deciusmus
fc-date and fc-end for reoccurring events
realWorldDate for sessionNotes
DR and DR_end for events or session notes (use DR_end not DR-end) as _ is eeasier to manage in JS


[11/13/2023 10:32 PM] .deciusmus
DR_end

{Reactions}
👍

[11/13/2023 10:32 PM] .deciusmus
not DR-end

[11/13/2023 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
all your parentLocation I'll turn to partOf?


[11/13/2023 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
or keep parentLocation


[11/13/2023 10:34 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/13/2023 10:34 PM] .deciusmus
turn to partOf


[11/13/2023 10:34 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't fixed the JS but that is easy


[11/13/2023 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
anything else I will pass on untouched if it is not empty, delete if it is empty, and then any additional little cleanup can be done directly with the Properties View in Obisidian


[11/13/2023 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
that is I think easier than trying to program all the little edge cases


[11/13/2023 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus
oh also I'm going to assume that anything in gazetteer is a place, even though that is not quite strictly true, and add place tags to everything as well as empty partOf: to help make that fast to fill in

{Reactions}
👍

[11/13/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
and I'm going convert [ stub ] in tags to [ status/stub ] if that doesn't bother you


[11/13/2023 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus
at the moment, I'm not going to clean up tags any more than inserting person, place, thing, person/ruler, person/pc


[11/13/2023 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a tag wrangler plugin (https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler) so I think probably most tag cleanup is easier done in obsidian itself

spent a bit of time this morning doing a bit of manual cleanup. there are still a handful of yaml lines that, for some unexplained reason, got output in "long form" but I don't think this is worth debugging in my python code. at some point we might consider https://platers.github.io/obsidian-linter/ if we really want to enforce strict yaml rules


[11/14/2023 11:10 AM] rsulfuratus
i am pretty busy this afternoon but might work on python code tonight - i think it would make sense to merge the metadata_cleanup PR, since right now my git history is a mess and all my python coding commits are intermingled with metadata cleaning commits, which is bad form but hard to resolve without just merging to main and starting a new python branch to clean up python functions


[11/14/2023 11:10 AM] rsulfuratus
(alternatively I might work on actual content tonight, we'll see)


[11/14/2023 11:15 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/14/2023 11:15 AM] .deciusmus
Happy for you to do that


[11/14/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
Im just done with a series of meetings and have a kinda dead 40 min til my next thing so I might muck around with JavaScript a bit


[11/14/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a few small changes to your metadata branch and spot checked it


[11/14/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
So looks reasonable to merge


[11/14/2023 11:16 AM] rsulfuratus
i'll merge PR now, have to fix few merge conflicts but should be minor


[11/14/2023 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
would be nice to make the template generator get info from tags since we don't have type anymore, would make it faster to regenerate headers


[11/14/2023 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah I can fix that


[11/14/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
I was mucking about with whereabouts because I’m trying to get a solid :

- give me a list of all people who are in place X at time Y


[11/14/2023 11:20 AM] .deciusmus
And I think the concept of current / home / origin / last know is not quite right


[11/14/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
But I’ll take a few min to look at cleaned up template stuff


[11/14/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
Do you use the “regenerate front matter” template or just the regen header / insert header ones ?


[11/14/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
I just use the header templates


[11/14/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
I was going to delete the front matter one as it is confusing and not up to date


[11/14/2023 11:43 AM] .deciusmus
Ok:

Template1 : Regenerate Header
Purpose: Deletes the header block and inserts the generate header template

Condition: File must have at least one tag, must not have a tags containing "stub"

Make sense?


[11/14/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
why not allow header regeneration for stubs? a lot of things i would tag stub are things with just header info


[11/14/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
but could use a different tag for that i guess


[11/14/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe stub = nothing


[11/14/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
wip = basic info but needs text


[11/14/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
i would say must have at least one non-status tag


[11/14/2023 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
you mean at least one tag that doesn't start status ?


[11/14/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/14/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
the idea being you shouldn't be able to regenerate headers for notes with just:
---
tags: [status/stub]

{Reactions}
👍

[11/14/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
---
tags: [status/stub]
---

no header

---
tags: [person, status/stub]
---

gets a header


[11/14/2023 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
to what extent do you think the header should look nice if there is very minimal info?


[11/14/2023 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. it is easier to code if we always generate the 

[!info]+ Biographical Summary

bit even if there is nothing else to do (for people, I mean)


[11/14/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
here is my attempt at a new whereabouts spec:

A whereabouts entry consists of four parts: 
- a type, which can be home or away
- a start, which is any date, an empty string, or a null/None value
- an end, which is any date, an empty string, or a null/None value
- a location, which is any string, which can be empty, or a null/None

A whereabouts entry must have a type.
A whereabouts entry with a type of away must have a start that is a valid date.

To calculate a whereabouts result requires a whereabouts metadata and a target date. The target date is usually the current date, but can be overwritten with yaml frontmatter (e.g. pageTargetDate). Functions to calculate whereabouts locations assume they will always be passed a metadata object from which whereabouts can be extracted, and a target date. If there is a pageTargetDate in the metadata, this will override the target date passed to the function. 

Given a whereabouts and a target date two additional values are calculated - imputed start and imputed end
for type home, the imputed start is equal to the earliest possible date, and the imputed end is equal to the target date
for type away, imputed start is always equal to start, which must be provided. if start is YYYY or YYYY-MM, imputed start should be the earliest valid month/day
for type away, imputed end is always equal to imputed_start


[11/14/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
1. An origin whereabouts is defined as the earliest 'home' location, where earliest is defined as the smallest imputed start.
If multiple home locations have the same date, the lexigraphically first home is considered the origin whereabouts.

2. A home whereabouts is defined as the valid home location with the shortest duration between imputed start and target date.
A valid home location is a home location where imputed end >= target date
If there are multiple valid home locations with equal duration between imputed start and target date, the lexigraphically last home is considered the home whereabouts.

3. A current whereabouts is defined as the valid current location with the shortest duration. 
A valid current location is determined by the following algorithm:
- if there are no away lines in the whereabouts, the only valid current location is the home location
- if there are away lines, the list of valid current locations is the set of away locations where imputed start <= target_date <= imputed_end
- if the list of valid current locations is empty, then the current whereabouts is set to unknown if real end is undefined, and home otherwise
- if the list of valid current locations is not empty, then the current whereabouts is set to the valid location with the shortest duration (imputed_end - imputed_start)


[11/14/2023 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
4. A last know whereabouts is defined as the valid current location with the shortest duration, defined as imputed_end - target_date. A known location cannot be unknown
A known location is determined by the following algorithm:
- if the current whereabouts is not unknown, the last known whereabouts is the current whereabouts, and the last known date is the target date
- if the current whereabouts is unknown, by definition there must be away lines, and there must be away lines with undefined real ends. in this scenario, to determine the last known location:
    - the last known location is the away lines where imputed_start <= target_date and with the shortest duration between imputed_end and target_date 
    - if there are multiple valid last known locations, the one with the shortest duration (imputed_end - imputed_start) is preferred
    - if there are multiple valid last known locations with the same duration, the one lexigraphically last in the file is preferred
    - the last known date is defined as the imputed_end of the last known location

[11/14/2023 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
Want to read that but trying to finish the header spec...


[11/14/2023 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
For the header, I have basically:

# <name>
> Biographical Info
> species (ancestry), pronouns
> get_pageDatedValue (ka for elves)
> > origin
> > home
> > last seen by party
> > current whereabouts


[11/14/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
that seems good to me


[11/14/2023 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
where:
(a) name block is always generated
(b) page dated value is always generated (it should return blank if there are no dates for the page)
(c) origin home etc are generated for any page that has whereabouts
(d) species line doesn't show the bits that are not in frontmatter


[11/14/2023 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, maybe I should only output page dated if the tag indicates it is a person, place, item, or organization


[11/14/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd leave pageDated for everything - if we eventually want to do something like add a date for events, e.g. just 
# Name
DR 567 - 677


[11/14/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
also, we should add pronuciation if it is not blank


[11/14/2023 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
although I guess for events that might not need to be dynamic


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so maybe better to only output for person, place, item, organization. or you could just check to see if born/created/died/destroyed is not null and only output if there are values for at least one of those


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
Where should pronunciation go?


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] .deciusmus

[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
#name
bio
(pro)


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd do:

# Name
*(pronuncidation)*

Biographical Info
species (ancestry), pronouns
get_pageDatedValue (ka for elves)
> origin
> home
> last seen by party
> current whereabouts


[11/14/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus

for other common types, I'd do something like:
1. for locations, output pageDated and "a <placeType> in <partOf1>, <partOf2>. also maybe output popuation if not blank, like age for pageDated. there might be other summary information for places that could be useful, but not positive


[11/14/2023 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
2. for items, output pagedDated and some kind of summary from magical, unique (for items that are unique or that represent a type), [mechanics](ddbLink), maker, owner


[11/14/2023 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
at the moment almost none of these are filled in so items is kind of low priority IMO


[11/14/2023 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
locations is more interesting because it is quite fast to fill in location metadata by hand and a lot of locations are stubs that could benefit from simple orientation information


[11/14/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
organizations probably don't really need much tbh, i don't have anything set for any organizations yet and founded/disbanded dates are generally not actually that important (especially because they can be a little ambiguous). probably a historical tag to indicate "was primarily active long ago and isn't a "current day" organization" is better

> To calculate a whereabouts result requires a whereabouts metadata and a target date. The target date is usually the current date, but can be overwritten with yaml frontmatter (e.g. pageTargetDate). Functions to calculate whereabouts locations assume they will always be passed a metadata object from which whereabouts can be extracted, and a target date. If there is a pageTargetDate in the metadata, this will override the target date passed to the function. 

From a specification perspective this isn't true. I might want to get the whereabouts at the last met by party date, for example. In which case the page date shouldn't override that.

From a specification standpoint I would just say "whereabouts has a target date" and leave it at that. The python function should require an input target date and fail if it isn't passed

I think that the imputed end is not target date. I would say that:
for type = home, the imputed_start is the minimum date and the imputed_end is the maximum date
for type = away, the start is required, and the imputed_end is the imputed_start


[11/14/2023 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
> for type away, imputed start is always equal to start, which must be provided. if start is YYYY or YYYY-MM, imputed start should be the earliest valid month/day

Question - if you have something with type: away and start: 1602, does that imply away for ALL of 1602? I think yes. Which would mean that the imputed_end for YYYY is YYYY-12-31 and for YYYY-MM is YYYY-MM-lastDayOfMM


[11/14/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
It seems weird otherwise that someone with a 
type: away, start: 1602, location: Sembara is considered "in sembara" only on 01-01-1602

Agree here.


[11/14/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus

Actually wait, this isn't right. The origin location is simply the first location that has type = home and no start.

I want to be able to say:

type: home, start: 1700, location: Cleenseau # date is approx

To represent someone with definitely no origin, i.e. where I know they didn't come from Cleenseau


[11/14/2023 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
This is distinguished from:

type: home, location: Cleenseau

which indicates they should be considered as "from" Cleenseau

vs

type: home, location: Embry
type: home, location: Cleenseau

for someone who is from Emby and now lives in Cleenseau

I don't think this is quite right. I think what you do is calculate the valid location (imputed start <= target date <= imputed end) where the start is closest to the target date, just like for home. 

But instead of imputed_end = end ?? start for type = away and imputed_end = end ?? max for home, you use imputed end = end ?? max date for both.

That gets you the "best match location". Then, either
(a) this location is type home - use it as current, last known is none
(b) this location is type away and has a real end - use it as current, last known is none
(c) this location is type away and has an undefined real end - 
then, if the target date == start date, use it as current, last known is none
otherwise, use it as last known, current as none


[11/14/2023 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I updated some things in the _MOC/Templates/Whereabouts and Location Specification

yes, this is automatic in my code, as I have a clean_date function that takes a possibly incomplete date and returns either start (earliest valid) or end (latest valid). start/born always calculated as earliest valid, end/died always calculated as latest valid, unless this needs to be overridden for some reason


[11/14/2023 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
It's all even simpler. You need:

filter_whereabouts
Given a whereabout list, a target date, and optional valid type this will return the whereabouts in the file order from the whereabout list that
(a) are valid (imputed start <= target <= imputed end && type matching if type specified)
(b) have the smallest possible target - start from amongst the valid items


[11/14/2023 4:56 PM] .deciusmus
origin = filter(target, "home").first()
if (origin.start) origin = undefined.

home = filter(target, "home").last()

current = filter(target, none).last()
lastKnown = current
if (!current.end && current.start != target)  current = undefined
else lastKnown = undefined


[11/14/2023 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing that doesn't work with the above is that if that you will end a last known = unknown in some cases when you should get a real last known


[11/14/2023 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
You would need to end up with  second check:

if (!lastKnown && !current) filter checking only for whereabouts in the past, and take the one where the end date is closed to target, i.e. where end - target is smallest


[11/14/2023 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
that gives you your last known


[11/14/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
Smallest duration is wrong; we want latest start date


[11/14/2023 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right, the trick is to correctly calculate imputed start and imputed end for all entries, and then just do the filter


[11/14/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
right, but actually imputed start is always earliest date and end latest date


[11/14/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
the actual trick is to allow "away" with no end to be found by the filter and then realize (because it has no end) that it isn't a valid "current" location


[11/14/2023 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
for example, a line with:
- { type: home, location: home } 
- { type: away, start = 1535, location: trip }

should return as 
orgin: home
home: home
current: home if target_date < 1535; trip if target_date == 1535, unknown if target_date > 1535
lastknown: home if target_date < 1535, trip if target_date >= 1535


[11/14/2023 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
there is also complication of unknown origin, e.g. 
- born: 1560
- whereabouts: 
  - { type: home, start: 1570, location: home }


[11/14/2023 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
oops


[11/14/2023 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. So the "filter" will return trip.
Then this:

if (!current.end && current.start != target)  current = undefined
else lastKnown = undefined

will fix current.

Then you need to realize that because you have no last known and no current, we need to see if there is a valid date in the past that we could use instead of last known.

So we look for a valid whereabouts in the past and pick the most recent one. home and trip are both valid in the past, but trip is more recent


[11/14/2023 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
Actually ignore that, in that case, we do have a valid last known


[11/14/2023 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
we get in trouble when the home ends and the trip ends


[11/14/2023 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
{ type: home, location: home, end  = 1535 }
{ type: away, start = 1535, end = 1537, location: trip }

in that case in 1538, we have no valid locations left. So what's our last known? We have to go hunt for something in the past


[11/14/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
how would your algorithm handle this if the current date is 1450:

```yaml
born: 
{ type: home, start: 1475, end: 1499, location: first home}
{ type: home, start: 1500, end: , location: home}
```


[11/14/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess just return unknown for everything because there are no valid whereabouts?


[11/14/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
(which should be the correct behavior IMO)


[11/14/2023 5:12 PM] .deciusmus
yup


[11/14/2023 5:12 PM] .deciusmus
the list is empty of valids so everything is unknown


[11/14/2023 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but this (which could be considered a data entry error) will I think trip it up:
```yaml
born: 1450
{ type: home, start: 1475, end: , location: home}
{ type: home, start: , end: , location: origin}
```


[11/14/2023 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
my thinking was:
- pageStart = born or date.min if not born
- imputed_start = start or pageStart if not start
- imputed_end = end or imputed_start if not end and type == away; end or date.max if not end and type == home


[11/14/2023 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
no, you don't need any of that


[11/14/2023 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
the imputed starts and ends are meaningless. you just want to assume if there is no start the start is minDate and if no end the end is maxDate


[11/14/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
in your code I don't think you can have a home with an unknown origin, for example


[11/14/2023 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
then you apply business logic, so to speak, on the result of the match


[11/14/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
how would you specify origin = unknown, home = home


[11/14/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
{ type: home, location: home, start: <any date> }


[11/14/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
or, alternatively, start: <any date after birth>


[11/14/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
puzzling over this


[11/14/2023 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't quite work for origin


[11/14/2023 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
because it won't pick things in the past


[11/14/2023 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
that's actually the key point, different between "current" vs "current or past"


[11/14/2023 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so for current dates (home/current location), you never care about anything except picking the valid date and then converting to unknown for current if !end


[11/14/2023 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/14/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
origin is a bit tricker, you need to know where you were when you were born, or the earliest home location you have recorded if you don't know when you were born


[11/14/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
but actually I think you can just ask for the valid date with target date = born if defined, or date.min if not


[11/14/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, origin isn't really tricky if we assume all origins have start = empty or start = before born


[11/14/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
as long as the start is equal to or before born, origin is the first home with targetDate = born (and if not found, first home with target date = dateMin)


[11/14/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
right but I want to be able to code someone as:
born: 1677
- { type: home, start: 1700, location: Chardon } #start is approx


[11/14/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
they don't have an origin because start: 1700 is in the future


[11/14/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess that would work with your as long as start is equal or before born


[11/14/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
right exactly I want them to be origin unknown


[11/14/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
> I mean, origin isn't really tricky if we assume all origins have start = empty or start = before born

this was confusing


[11/14/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
you can have an unknown origin if you 
a: have the first line of the whereabouts be { type: home, location: }
b: have a defined born date, and no home locations that have start <= born


[11/14/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think this is what you said


[11/14/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Yes


[11/14/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
As an aside, I pushed a bunch of template stuff


[11/14/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
look in _testing\headertests


[11/14/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
has the "max" of each type


[11/14/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
you can see what various bits look like by commenting out parts of the yaml


[11/14/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
```python
def filter_whereabouts(whereabouts, target_date, type=None):
    """
    Takes a whereabouts list of dicts, a target date, and optionally a type
    Returns all valid whereabouts for the specified type on the target date
    """

    target_date = clean_date(target_date)

    valid_whereabouts = []

    for entry in whereabouts:
        if type is not None and entry['type'] != type:
            continue
        else:
            #valid type, or no type specified
            start_date = clean_date(entry['start'])
            end_date = clean_date(entry['end'], end=True)
            if start_date <= target_date <= end_date:
                valid_whereabouts.append(entry)


    return valid_whereabouts
```


[11/14/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
writing another function to do the actual selecting of a valid whereabouts


[11/14/2023 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
will need a little tweaking to work for origin and last known I think
and forgot the
```
            start_date = clean_date(entry['start']) if "start" in entry else date.min
            end_date = clean_date(entry['end'], end=True) if "start" in entry else date.max
```


[11/14/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
you need the option of allowing dates in the past


[11/14/2023 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
should a function return "unknown" or None/null


[11/14/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
null


[11/14/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
But actually I implemented in Javascript as well for fun and there are lots of little issues


[11/14/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
Basically the line

{ type: home, location: origin }

causes lots of headaches


[11/14/2023 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
because it is always valid


[11/14/2023 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
right, but that is the desired behavior isn't it?


[11/14/2023 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
whats the correct current location for this:

---
pageTargetDate: 1500
whereabouts:
- { type: home, location: origin }
- { type: home, end: 1499, location: home }
---


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
origin


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
ok


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
that's easy then


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
and whats the right home?


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
also origin?


[11/14/2023 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
origin, however, is tricky for that one


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess you just take the lexically first


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
so its fine


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
origin is always origin


[11/14/2023 6:17 PM] .deciusmus
what's the right answers for this?
---
pageTargetDate: 1501
whereabouts:
- { type: home, location: origin }
- { type: home, start: 1401, end: 1499, location: home }
- { type: away, start: 1500, location: trip }
---


[11/14/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
current: unknown
last know: trip
origin: origin
home: origin


[11/14/2023 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
so basically you expect that we should be setting end:  on the origin line if you want it to not be valid


[11/14/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
not necessarily. 
pageTargetDate: 1501
whereabouts:
- { type: home, location: origin }
- { type: home, start: 1401, end: , location: home }
- { type: away, start: 1500, location: trip }

should report 
origin: origin
home: home
current: unknown
last known: trip


[11/14/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
and:
pageTargetDate: 1501
whereabouts:
- { type: home, location: origin }
- { type: home,  location: home }
- { type: away, start: 1500, location: trip }


[11/14/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
should report the same


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, I don't think we should assume that file order takes precedent over validness, it is only used to break ties


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
So if you set an END date on home, you better also set an END date on origin


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
is the real message


[11/14/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. 

Guy X came from Chardon, lives in Cleenseau, left Cleenseau in 1719 for parts unknown


[11/14/2023 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, for that person you need to set end on the Chardon line


[11/14/2023 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
you need to, at the point you are setting end: 1719 on the Cleenseau home line also need to set an end: xxx on the Chardon line, but it could be end: born if you want


[11/14/2023 6:23 PM] .deciusmus
```
           let originDate = DateManager.parse_date_to_events_date(metadata.born, false) ?? DateManager.parse_date_to_events_date("0001-01-01", false)
            let normalized = metadata.whereabouts.map(f => this.getNormalizedWhereabout(f))
           
            let homes = this.filterWhereabouts(normalized, "home", targetDate, false)
            let origins = this.filterWhereabouts(normalized, "home", originDate, false)
           
            whereaboutResult.home = homes.last()
            whereaboutResult.origin = origins.first()

            if (whereaboutResult.origin.startDate) whereaboutResult.origin = undefined

            let current = this.filterWhereabouts(normalized, undefined, targetDate, false).last()
        
            if (current) {
                if (targetDate.sort <= current.awayEnd.sort) {
                    // this away is truely valid
                    whereaboutResult.current = current
                    whereaboutResult.lastKnown = undefined;
                } else {
                    // this away is our best guess as to location, but we are not still there
                    whereaboutResult.current = undefined
                    whereaboutResult.lastKnown = current;
                }

                return whereaboutResult
            }

            // this means we don't have a current whereabout - everything is in the past
            whereaboutResult.lastKnown = this.filterWhereabouts(normalized, undefined, targetDate, true).last()                   
```


[11/14/2023 6:23 PM] .deciusmus
is my working code


[11/14/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
Guy X came from Chardon, lives in Cleenseau, left Cleenseau in 1719 to go back to Chardon could be:
- { type: home, location: Chardon }
- { type: home, start 1700, end 1719, location: Cleenseau }


[11/14/2023 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
where filter whereabouts is:

```
    get_distance_to_target(item, target) {    
        if (item.logicalEnd.sort < target.sort) { 
            return target.jsDate - item.logicalEnd.jsDate
        }
        else return target.jsDate - item.logicalStart.jsDate
    }

    filterWhereabouts(whereaboutsList, type, target, allowPast) {
        let candidateSet = whereaboutsList.filter(w => (!type || w.type == type) && (w.logicalStart.sort <= target.sort)).filter(w => allowPast || target.sort <= w.logicalEnd.sort)
        let soonestPossible =   Math.min(...candidateSet.map(w =>  this.get_distance_to_target(w, target)))           
        return candidateSet.filter(w =>  this.get_distance_to_target(w, target) == soonestPossible)
    }
```


[11/14/2023 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
oof I hate reading javascript code especially after working in python


[11/14/2023 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/14/2023 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
I gotta go deal with dinner anyway


[11/14/2023 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
could maybe add affiliations to people notes?


[11/14/2023 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
might be too much clutter


[11/14/2023 6:36 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, maybe “member of: “


[11/14/2023 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Just not sure whether to put it before the dated stuff or after


[11/14/2023 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
I could do it below the pronoun line


[11/14/2023 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
that is where I'd put it


[11/14/2023 6:38 PM] .deciusmus
I added “rulerOf” to rulers


[11/14/2023 6:38 PM] .deciusmus
It might also be worth mapping family


[11/14/2023 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
if you want to get really fancy, you'd parse organization frontmatter and have separate report for family/clan vs other


[11/14/2023 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
Something like:
Ruler of (kingdom) of (family)
Member of : (a), (b), (c)


[11/14/2023 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
Or for non rulers

Of (family)
Member of: (ab), (c)


[11/14/2023 6:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/14/2023 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure if I like it


[11/14/2023 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
But I might play around after dinner


[11/14/2023 6:41 PM] rsulfuratus
might also try:
Person, Of Family


[11/14/2023 6:41 PM] rsulfuratus
at least for rulers, e.g., 
Queen Some NPC of the House of HouseName


[11/14/2023 6:42 PM] rsulfuratus
might be overkill for non-rulers, e.g. 
Ander of the Charmhearts


[11/14/2023 6:43 PM] rsulfuratus
would prefer just 
Name Family


[11/14/2023 6:43 PM] rsulfuratus
that is assuming we use metadata for family instead of affiliations - not sure which is best


[11/14/2023 7:12 PM] .deciusmus
Name Family is tricky because I don’t love the link in the header


[11/14/2023 7:12 PM] .deciusmus
I also think we should add partOf to organizations


[11/14/2023 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
So I could have 
Army Garrison of Cleenseau - partOf - Army of the West - partOf - Sembaran Army


[11/14/2023 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
And I might change rulerOf to leaderOf and also use it for my organizations


[11/14/2023 7:16 PM] .deciusmus
Was also thinking orgType - and use that to find if something is a family or not


[11/14/2023 7:18 PM] .deciusmus
It’s easier on the organization page to just have a 

# Members
Dataview query that gets everyone with affialiation contains this.file


[11/14/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/14/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
definitely think partOf makes sense for orgs


[11/14/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I wrote a python function that converts DR to CY


[11/14/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
putting my python date code in dateFunctions.py


[11/14/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
all of them take strings and can return strings instead of datetime objects


[11/14/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure how to use a DR to CY


[11/14/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
because... I need to know the source date


[11/14/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
I think we should get rid of get_home vs get_current for whereabouts


[11/14/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
so the template is just a single get_whereabouts

{Reactions}
👍

[11/14/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
what i was actually doing is trying to figure out how to go DR to CY, which is more useful, since you can't have negative dates


[11/14/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
at least with python date objects


[11/14/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
so the idea is all comparisons are done internally in dwarven years, and then converted back to DR for display


[11/14/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but actually it was just to see if I could come up with a reasonable calculator


[11/14/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
I'd like to be able to do 1111 DR vs 3333 CY in display but haven't quite figured it out

how do you calculate killed location?

just current for died date?


[11/14/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
it is the "current" location of where they died

[11/14/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
more specifically, the whereabouts logic just returns a "current" for the target date, but it doesn't know if the person is dead or alive


[11/14/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
So the current location means at that date, the person was there. But the script knows they are dead, so switches to killed


[11/14/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess it would be fairly silly to worry about the situation where a body is moved after they die


[11/14/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
you wouldn't track that with whereabouts anyway


[11/14/2023 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/14/2023 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
if the person was killed without a current location:

[11/14/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
that is where the "Valit" whereabout has no end date (whereas the previous example it had an end date > target)


[11/14/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
slightly annoyingly, the logic doesn't quite work for people killed in the past


[11/14/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
aha, but if the page is dead I can just used the death date for whereabouts

Should I push this to main? I have deleted get_CurrentWhereabouts and get_HomeWhereabouts and replaced with a new get_Whereabouts

based on orgType: family in the organization page


[11/14/2023 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if you have

affiliations: [a, b]

and a has orgType: family

we parse that as the family. If there are multiple familes we take the first

I might spend some time in a bit fixing real data, so if you want to take a minute to make sure you are happy with the templates would be good


[11/14/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
although not hard to recreate


[11/14/2023 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
do you have test data?


[11/14/2023 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
for whereabouts


[11/14/2023 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
also at least on my computer the template code needs to output an extra newline


[11/14/2023 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I was output to fix that

Alban has a bug


[11/14/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
'_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts.js'.

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startDate')


[11/14/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
looks like you don't accept full dates for home starts?


[11/14/2023 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
it should


[11/14/2023 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
that bug is that if there is no origin it doesn't work

[11/14/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
for Casian as well


[11/14/2023 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
both fixed by deleted MM-DD from start


[11/14/2023 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
fix pushed


[11/14/2023 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
deleting  the dates from start actually changes the underlying logic and makes the first line eligible to be an origin


[11/14/2023 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
i.e with 
born: 1722
whereabouts:
- {type: home, start: 1722-01-02, end: '', location: 'Chardon, Chardonian Empire'}

Casian doesn't have an origin, as Chardon is > birth date


[11/14/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
right but it is okay to not have an origin


[11/14/2023 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
but 

- {type: home, start: 1722, end: '', location: 'Chardon, Chardonian Empire'}

Chardon is a valid origin


[11/14/2023 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
Yes, but that was the bug


[11/14/2023 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
Just a missing null check


[11/14/2023 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a fix


[11/14/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
```yaml
whereabouts:
- {type: home, start: '', end: '', location: 'Luminatia, Chardonian Empire'}
- {type: away, start: 1748-03-11, end: '', location: ''}

[11/14/2023 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
what are you expecting the above to output?


[11/14/2023 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
i am expected same output if location: "" or if location: "unknown"


[11/14/2023 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
either both should just report "Based in Luminatia" or both should report "Based, Last known: unknown, Current: unknown"


[11/14/2023 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
probably the latter


[11/14/2023 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
or perhaps no last known


[11/14/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
The lack of "Based in Luminatia was just a bug


[11/14/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
I was forgetting to return anything if there was no last known and also no current


[11/14/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
Or rather, if there WAS a last known but without a location


[11/14/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
But then the question is:
what is the output if the current or last known whereabout does not have a location


[11/14/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
Outputing "last known: unknown" seems pointless


[11/14/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
But presumably you added the away line for a reason


[11/14/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
I guess maybe Current location: unknown is the right thing to output here?


[11/14/2023 10:03 PM] rsulfuratus
this is the dad of the boy you talked to on the sending stone


[11/14/2023 10:03 PM] rsulfuratus
he left home, but no one knows where


[11/14/2023 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/14/2023 10:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but he might return so just putting an end on home is not quite right


[11/14/2023 10:04 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I think 

Based in: xxx
Current location: Unknown 

is correct


[11/14/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
The core whereabout function was returning the right thing... a last known whereabout with location = null


[11/14/2023 10:08 PM] .deciusmus
but I think the right thing to do is basically treat location: "" as the same as location: unknown, except it won't output the last known whereabouts


[11/14/2023 10:09 PM] .deciusmus
fix pushed


[11/14/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd consider getting rid of the "Last" in "Last met", and instead just capitolize the first letter of whatever is in type for campaign info


[11/14/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
then you can have:

[11/14/2023 10:20 PM] .deciusmus

[11/14/2023 10:32 PM] rsulfuratus
still have the issue of export - it would really help to have a bunch of yaml that you test on that I can verify behaves the same


[11/14/2023 10:32 PM] rsulfuratus
probably not going to touch that until this weekend, we'll see


[11/14/2023 10:32 PM] .deciusmus
whereabouts with type away and no start date is defined as invalid


[11/14/2023 10:32 PM] .deciusmus
per the spe


[11/14/2023 10:32 PM] .deciusmus
maybe that's wrong, but thats why the failure


[11/14/2023 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
right, of course


[11/14/2023 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
that might be one where it is easier to just use a fudged start


[11/14/2023 10:34 PM] rsulfuratus
end is fudged too obviously

[11/14/2023 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe there is no reason away must have a start


[11/14/2023 10:35 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I think with the new algo it makes no sense to assert on it or require it


[11/14/2023 10:35 PM] .deciusmus
because lack of start just means start = earliest possible date


[11/14/2023 10:36 PM] .deciusmus
which is fine, for Revaka (who doesn't have a born date) you just want to report her in the mirror of soul trappin for all dates


[11/14/2023 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/14/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
it is probably not worth recoding stuff, but there is some logic in having a third type that is not home but behaves like home, that is lets you have indefinte start/end


[11/14/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for Revaka, you'd ideally want just:
- { type: "something", start:, end:, location: mirror }


[11/14/2023 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus
it is just like home but reports "Current location" instead of "Based in"


[11/14/2023 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus
or you could just use home/away, but add an optional display variable


[11/14/2023 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
But type: away with no start date does report Current location


[11/14/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., 
- { type: "home", start, end, location: mirror, display: "Trapped in: " }


[11/14/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, instead of Current location


[11/14/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
is that worth it?


[11/14/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
type away with no start and no end doesn't work


[11/14/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
that is true, you need a fudged end


[11/14/2023 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus
it is probably easily to add an optional displayDefaults for homeString that overwrites the normal logic


[11/14/2023 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
eh, type: away with no start and end works now 🙂


[11/14/2023 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus
not for me


[11/14/2023 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't pushed the fix


[11/14/2023 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
ah


[11/14/2023 10:44 PM] .deciusmus
The logic is just to say that an away with no start or end is just like a home with no start or end -- it is valid for all time


[11/14/2023 10:44 PM] .deciusmus
but because there is no home, you get "current" instead of "home"


[11/14/2023 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i still think it is clearer to have a way to overwrite the default text


[11/14/2023 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
pushed


[11/14/2023 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
I actually like the type: away no date. It models nicely the idea of someone who is
(a) somewhere
(b) for an undefined and therefore infinite period of time
(c) but it isn't there home


[11/14/2023 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
It is different from away with a start and no end, which implies traveling. This version (no start, no end) implies some permanent non-home state


[11/14/2023 10:52 PM] rsulfuratus
why doesn't this generate a correct location for last seen by party?
- {type: home, start: '', end: '', location: unknown}
- {type: home, start: 1733-01-02, end: '', location: 'Tollen, Western Green Sea'}

The second home should be the current whereabout at dec 30 1748


[11/14/2023 10:58 PM] .deciusmus
There might be some bug in how the template handles current vs home but it shouldn’t care about home


[11/14/2023 10:58 PM] rsulfuratus
doesn't really matter right now


[11/14/2023 10:59 PM] rsulfuratus
i have to put this aside for a bit, have two sessions worth of session notes to write from two different games plus a massive battle to prep


[11/14/2023 10:59 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense


[11/14/2023 10:59 PM] rsulfuratus
before i do any work on the python end of things I need to develop a really robust set of testing whereabouts


[11/14/2023 11:00 PM] rsulfuratus
it is easy to test the functions in a notebook but really annoying to test against actual obsidian notes


[11/14/2023 11:01 PM] rsulfuratus
i got chatgpt to convert your whereabouts code to python which actually looks fairly reasonable.


[11/14/2023 11:01 PM] rsulfuratus
i looked at just using it directly but the date stuff makes that a real pain


[11/14/2023 11:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(e..g with that javascript-to-python bridge)


[11/14/2023 11:02 PM] .deciusmus
I think my code handles string dates just fine


[11/14/2023 11:02 PM] rsulfuratus
no, i mean, i'd have to load all your DateManager stuff too, because it is too embedded in the whereabouts to use the whereabouts and not the Datamanager


[11/14/2023 11:03 PM] .deciusmus
Ah. I could trivially merge those though


[11/15/2023 8:11 AM] rsulfuratus
probably not going to do much coding on taelgar stuff today, but am thinking a bit about organization and don't really like having the python stuff embedded in the taelgar notes repository (the javascript makes more sense since it is never run independently of the notes). so i'm splitting out the python code into a new taelgar-utils repo, which we could make a submodule of taelgar if we wanted to. i spent a while trying to get the calling java in python to work last night and I think it is probably faster and easier to debug chatgpt translated code than debug a pure python java vm running inside my python code, and for anything other than header generation we probably need a different solution anyway


[11/15/2023 8:13 AM] rsulfuratus
anyway, not going to think about this deeply today and tonight will probably mostly work on content, but this is what i'm thinking right now


[11/15/2023 9:02 AM] rsulfuratus
okay I lied, I'm actually messing around with updating my python utilities. what data do you actually use from the various json configs (I guess primarily metadata.json and taelgarConfig.json)


[11/15/2023 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
Taelgar config is gone


[11/15/2023 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
I don’t think it is used at all


[11/15/2023 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
Metadata config is used for the campaign prefix mapping only


[11/15/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
But I don’t think anything in python needs that. If the idea is that the python code is only to reimplement the dynamic bits, at the moment the only dynamic page pieces that don’t depend on dv.table are:

Get whereabouts
Get page dated value
Get regnal value


[11/15/2023 11:02 AM] .deciusmus
The page dated and regnal stuff in turn requires the fantasy calendar json for current date. 

The whereabouts stuff uses current date logic as well, plus a bunch of obsidian apis to map Cleenseau to Cleenseau, Barony of Averil, Sembara


[11/15/2023 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm making my own config for the python utilities that allow you to set things like default campaign and obsidian path, and if you had anything that got information like a default campaign from an existing json i'd read it from there (like I read current date from the fantasy calendar data json) instead of from the utilities  config


[11/15/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
No, none of the JavaScript cares about default campaign


[11/15/2023 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
Thinking ahead a bit, btw, if we define some “core” dataview tables it might be relatively realistic, using obsidian tools, to just recreate them in python


[11/15/2023 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah obsidian tools is pretty nice. it certainly makes things like building the location chain from partOf metadata very easy


[11/15/2023 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
it is harder to implement stuff that uses dataviewjs for complex filtering


[11/15/2023 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
Right but if we had something like

dvStandardTables.getNPCsInTown(dv.current())


[11/15/2023 11:07 AM] .deciusmus
It might be pretty straightforward to just use obsidian tools to reimplement the npcs in the town table


[11/15/2023 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah. at least until i find a work coding project to work on and spend my breaks from meetings and paper editing and grant writing doing work instead of hobby programming

Well maybe by then someone will have done something open source or obsidian will have a cleaner way to generate markdown or something

ha, maybe.


[11/15/2023 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
I am assuming it is on you to tag people I newly create with duFr/unware and so on. That is, you, if you care, should find all pages with tag = person and !tag = dufr and fix. Or are you hoping I will add tags for you?


[11/15/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
no, don't add tags


[11/15/2023 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus
I will probably update my various filters to just use person not dufr instead of having a specific dufr unaware

But being able to tag a sembaran royalty to a bunch of kingdoms really helps keeping track of when various places were conqueored/broke away


[11/15/2023 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
what tag are we using for stubs?


[11/15/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
status/stubs


[11/15/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
*status/stub


[11/15/2023 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i plan to have: "status/stub" for stubs, "status/uptodate" for don't need to work on this unless something changes during a session that impact its, "status/wip" for something in between, and perhaps "status/notes" for pages with extensive notes that need to be integrated (or perhaps use status/wip for that)


[11/15/2023 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
my logic for having them all under status is it makes it easy to find tags with no status information (which are kind of a random mix)

[11/15/2023 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
Do you think the header generator should link everything even if is dangling?


[11/15/2023 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if someone has an affliation that is not currently a page, do we create it as

[[something]]
or just
something


[11/15/2023 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i used to dislike all the dangling links, but I use them a lot now to keep track of things that should have a page


[11/15/2023 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
so i'd lean towards awlays link


[11/15/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i usually browse the dangling links page and create pages for things with like 5+ dangling notes


[11/15/2023 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
I've just been cleaning up sembaran royalty and it is kinda annoying to have

House of Teckburg

unlinked, because then I need to go create the page manually and so on


[11/15/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm fine with always linked

{Reactions}
👍

[11/15/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
also helps to find things that aren't consistently named as you get a bunch of dangling links to something you have a page for


[11/15/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
although I'm not sure the best way to fix that - i guess create the page and then merge?


[11/15/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
if you just create the page you get all the ugly full paths


[11/15/2023 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
but does merge clean those up? i guess we can test


[11/15/2023 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
it does

[11/15/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
The only annoying thing about having family be part of affiliations is that if the page doesn't exist it displays wrong


[11/15/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
So for I example I had to create a page for the Dharajun Dynasty. But I guess that is fine


[11/15/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
how does it display families again? it looks up the page and gets the tag information to determine display?


[11/15/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/15/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
it looks for front matter of
orgType: family


[11/15/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay so anything not tagged family gets the: member of [[thing]]


[11/15/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
familes get the "of xxx"
others get
Member of: xxx


[11/15/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
so family pages need to be named the FamilyNamePlural?


[11/15/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
or do you insert "the"


[11/15/2023 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
The current logic is:

Given affiliation: [x, y]

We look for the page named x
if the page exists, we use the "name" attribute from frontmatter, and if it is different from the page name, link like [name|file], otherwise we link like [file]

if the page doesn't exist, we just link [x]


[11/15/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay that makes sense


[11/15/2023 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
But we might want 2 different names - a name and a descriptor


[11/15/2023 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
because, i.e. to get

the Dharajun dynasty

instead of The Dharajun Dynasty

I had to set the name in the page to the Dharajun dynasty
which means the header of the page is

# the Dharajun dynasty

not

# The Dharajun Dynasty

or

# Dharajun dynasty


[11/15/2023 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, I could just add "the", i.e. say

of the <x>
rather than
of <x>


[11/15/2023 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
for given group, I think you want 
Member of: [XXXX]
of [XXXX] 
# XXXX (on the org page)

to pretty much always be the same, the only difference is you want the title on the org page to be title case, the member of [XXXX] to be title case, and the of [XXXX] to be unconverted


[11/15/2023 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if I tag Grash's Horde as a family and a random orc gets "of Grash's Horde", I don't want a the inserted


[11/15/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/15/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
maybe I should just do:

of <x> where I toLower the first letter in x


[11/15/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
but even that isn't right


[11/15/2023 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd do it the other way


[11/15/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
because you don't want

of grash's horde


[11/15/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
for the header of org, you to x to upper the first letter in x


[11/15/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes more sense.


[11/15/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
then you set the name of Dharajun Dynasty to "the Dharajun Dynasty", the file name to Dharajun Dynasty", and add an alias for Dharajun if you wish


[11/15/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
displays as "The Dharajun Dynasty" for the title; "of the Dharajun Dynasty" in person pages, and links to either Dharajun Dynasty or Dharajun (if set as an alias)


[11/15/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
for Grash's Horde, you'd have just Grash's Horde as title


[11/15/2023 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
(name sorry not title)


[11/15/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
what happens if there are multiple family affiliations? i assume this is an error?


[11/15/2023 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus
in that case might treat it not as family, might instead organization groups into two classes - membershipType: unique and membershipType: shared
you can only be in one membershipType unique group and these are displayed as "of [[NAME]]" in person pages
you can be in as many membershipType shared groups as you want and these are displayed as "Member of: [[XXXX.toTitle]], [[YYYY.toTitle]] on person pages


[11/15/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
that lets you use the "family" tag for things like orc hordes where it isn't really family but functions like family. or perhaps deno'qai tribes


[11/15/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
they are family-ish


[11/15/2023 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
separately, i wonder how to track dwarven thuhrs, I think probably just having them as affiliations is fine, with the name set to Ruler Thuhr


[11/15/2023 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
alternatively if you can display multiple families, perhaps just leave orgType: family and document that this is family-ish things, and primarily controls whether a person is "of [XXXX]" or "Member: [XXX]",


[11/15/2023 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
So I implemented as follows:

Anytime you get a "name" of something (family, place, person) you can decide if you want title casing or not.

Title case = yes: We uppercase every first letter except for a short hardcoded list of words (the, of, an, and a few others) which are kept lower case if they are NOT the first word. 

So the House of Sewick in title case is The House of Sewick not The House of Sewick

Title case = no: preserve exact casing


[11/15/2023 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
Currently, we use title case for:

Member of: xxx, on people pages when linking to an affiliation
H1 title on all pages

Everything use uses regular case


[11/15/2023 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
Aliases are ignored


[11/15/2023 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I’d use title case for location partOf probably too


[11/15/2023 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Although that might never come up?


[11/15/2023 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
The Green Sea vs the Green Sea


[11/15/2023 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean you might never have the plain text be non-title case


[11/15/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Well, do you want:

Current Location: Tollen, the Green Sea

or

Current Location: Tollen, Green Sea

or

Current Location: Tollen, The Green Sea


[11/15/2023 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I would lean towards last


[11/15/2023 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
I guess if you are never going to want the Green Sea (outside of plain text like the [[Green Sea]]) then I'm not sure it matters because the name can just be The Green Sea


[11/15/2023 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
Right. We don’t really have a consistent scheme for how to name pages, eg what is the file called, what goes in aliases, and what goes in name


[11/15/2023 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
Ok, well, I implemented so that for locations I implemented as:
People:

"Ruler of X": regular case
All whereabouts: title case EXCEPT died in X is regular case
(so Lived in: The Green Sea or died in the Green Sea)

Organizations:

"Based in: X" title case

Places:
"an inn in X": title case

Additionally, where it says title case, only the first in the location series is title case.

So:

an inn in the Seventh Ward, Tollen, The Green Sea

instead of

an inn in the Seventh Ward, Tollen, the Green Sea


[11/15/2023 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
It obviously doesn't matter if the name is already title cased


[11/15/2023 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
> Right. We don’t really have a consistent scheme for how to name pages, eg what is the file called, what goes in aliases, and what goes in name

It would be good to define this. There are really several things:

1) The file name. This is what you need to specify in anything that tries to read the file (partOf, affiliations) as well as the easiest thing to link to when typing
2) The aliases. This is an almost-as-easy-as-the-filename thing to refer to when typing (but if you rename the file, links via alias don't rename automatically, they rename the target but keep the same text)
3) The front matter "names". These are used in constructing the header and in generating content


[11/15/2023 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I think for people, the convention should be:
file name - unique full name w/out title
aliases - anything you want to auto link (eg just first name)
name - display name which can vary, eg for generic halflings I’d set to full name but for Wellby goodbarrel just to Wellby


[11/15/2023 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
header is: title + name


[11/15/2023 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
For organizations and places it is a bit trickier. I’d lean towards never including starting prepositions in the file name, except when you would never say “place” <other noun> where place is an adjective


[11/15/2023 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Eg Green Sea trade routes


[11/15/2023 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
So for example inn names that start with “The” might be easier to leave alone


[11/15/2023 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
Rationale is for linking. Green Sea will link either The Green Sea or just Green Sea, but if file name is Green Sea you need aliases and this gets annoying when fixing names


[11/15/2023 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
Eg still a bunch of broken Great War links from “the Great War” vs “Great War”


[11/15/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
Do you mean if the file name is The Green Sea


[11/15/2023 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
if the file name is "Green Sea", the if I type "Wellby confronted a group of Green Sea merchants" and "It was a calm day on the Green Sea" in session notes, both will autolink


[11/15/2023 1:19 PM] rsulfuratus
if the file name is "The Green Sea", only the first will autolink (or neither, depending on how autolinking handles case)


[11/15/2023 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
you can just add "Green Sea" as an alias, but then a) when you have "the Green Sea" in session notes, it gives you two choices to link to that point towards the same page (more likely to produce garbled links when you are clicking fast), and b) if we ever change the name of the Green Sea, only the text linked to the file directly, and not to the alias, will update


[11/15/2023 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so my argument is that (for places and organizations at least) we should usually prefer linking to the file name, and should prefer file names without leading prepositions to make auto linking easier


[11/15/2023 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
But the text string
The Green Sea 
In a session note will generate a link like
The [[Green Sea]]
Right?


[11/15/2023 1:22 PM] rsulfuratus
not if the file name is The Green Sea


[11/15/2023 1:22 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/15/2023 1:22 PM] .deciusmus
We are agreeing


[11/15/2023 1:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yes okay


[11/15/2023 1:23 PM] .deciusmus
“the” should never be in file names unless it is intrisnic to the place, ie The Flying Fox Inn

[11/15/2023 1:23 PM] .deciusmus

[11/15/2023 1:24 PM] .deciusmus
To go back to families for a minute while I eat lunch…


[11/15/2023 1:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so then I think the convention is pretty simple:
file name is unique full name without leading prepositions
name is display name, in regular case if you want the option for it to show up in regular case, in title case if you always want title case
aliases are used for any other text that should link to that page (but don't include the <file name> or really any alias that contains the file name, unless there is a good reason)


[11/15/2023 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
Yes


[11/15/2023 1:27 PM] .deciusmus
With one exception for people an  alias  of just first name


[11/15/2023 1:27 PM] .deciusmus
Also sometimes the file name needs disambiguating


[11/15/2023 1:28 PM] rsulfuratus
right, aliases that are just part of the file name, or if there are two pages with the same file name, would be good reasons to include exceptions


[11/15/2023 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
Does this imply the Drankorian emperors should have file names of just X rather than Emperor X?

[11/15/2023 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
The basic idea is that a person might have a “special” organization that we want to display differently. I think there is also an implication that a person can only belong to one of these organizations at a time. Most commonly this is a noble house, a clan, an extended family, an orc horde, etc. Most commonly it’s tied to birth or marriage although there are exceptions. 

At the moment the only thing we want to do differently with these organizations is show a “of X” line rather than a member of: x line


[11/15/2023 1:38 PM] .deciusmus
One option is to make this something other than an affiliation / organization pair. This is likely annoying though given for data query purposes we think these are basically the same


[11/15/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
Looking at Wikipedia a bunch, there is a tendency to structure "affiliations" via affiliation specific language, i.e. have a bio block like:

Political Party: XXX
Other political affilations: YYY, ZZZ

or

House: QQQ

or

Company: YYY
Board Member of: QQQ, ZZZ


[11/15/2023 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
for simplicity, I'd start with just a simple true/false flag in organization metadata that is true if we want to print "of XXXX" and false otherwise


[11/15/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
if we want to later on we can use the organization/XXXX tags to trigger different display information, but this seems overkill at the moment


[11/15/2023 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
on names - can i also request that we don't use unicode characters in file names? Alicarinquë always messes up my git history because my work terminal and my home terminal interpret it differently for some reason i don't care to debug

I was starting to write a longer reply here but got pulled into a meeting


[11/15/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
I think the real question is:

* orgType and membershipType
* just membershipType
* just orgType

I don't love the idea that you *have* to be in a single noble house or you get an error, so either way I think that only the first affiliation that matches the rule gets special treatment.


[11/15/2023 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that's fine


[11/15/2023 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I would actually call it orgDisplay not orgType


[11/15/2023 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is not an actual classification (e.g., i'd probably put orgDisplay = True or whatever) on adventuring parties, to get Dewalth of the Side Quests


[11/15/2023 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
you could even just make it an optional displayDefaults value


[11/15/2023 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
if you really want to make it customizable you have have an additional primaryOrg optional display default on a person page that overrides group tags and assigns that to the primary org


[11/15/2023 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
so the idea would be that any person page has 0 or 1 primary organizations.

primary organizations are determined as: 
- the first affiliation that has the orgType = primary or whatever
- unless the primaryOrg displayDefault is set on the person page, which then uses that


[11/15/2023 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
that is probably overengineered since you could just rely on changing the affiliation order


[11/15/2023 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
unless there are some organizations that you want to be displayed as "of XXX" on some pages and "member of: xxxx" on other pages


[11/15/2023 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
So if you are [ House of Sewick, House of Lils, Oracle of the Riven ] you get

of House of Sewick
Member of: House of Lils, Oracle of the Riven


[11/15/2023 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/15/2023 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
I would do something a little different


[11/15/2023 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
I would say that we have an "orgType" just to categorize orgs for unknown future purposes

and then the displayDefaults has a primaryOrgType: X


[11/15/2023 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
We can then default the primaryOrgType to "family"


[11/15/2023 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that's fine


[11/15/2023 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
that allows any customization you want as long as all orgs have an orgType


[11/15/2023 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
presuming that if primaryOrgType is undefined it will never display "of XXX"


[11/15/2023 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
should orgtype just be a tag though?


[11/15/2023 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess it is a bit easier to look up orgType


[11/15/2023 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
and also enforces that all orgs can only have one type, which is probably good


[11/15/2023 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway yes I think your solution works fine


[11/15/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
your regenerate header script deletes all the text in a file if there is no header there to begin with, is that intended/is there another template to use if a header doesn't exist?


[11/15/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
also - do we want the top level folders in the gazetteer to be "The South Region" or "South Region"


[11/15/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
Either we should default displayOrg to family in the display defaults section in the python yaml cleanup, or we should assume family if it isn't present


[11/15/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
it is kinda a pain perhaps to go add it to all the rulers I just fixed


[11/15/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
That is a bug, it shouldn't do anything if there is no yaml frontmatter


[11/15/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus

[11/15/2023 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
It considers everything between the end of the yaml and the first newline to be "header frontmatter"


[11/15/2023 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I could update it to say if the "header frontmatter" has no h1 to not delete and just insert

an undead or a undead? both sound ok in my head


[11/15/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
it is just words that start with "u" but phonetically sound like "you"


[11/15/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., a universe, a university, a unicycle


[11/15/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
might just be "uni"


[11/15/2023 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
yeah but Javascript doesn't have a handy helper function for what the phonentic sound of a word is!


[11/15/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but it would be "an uninformed person"


[11/15/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
it is plain text so it is easy to fix

there are also some others like an hour not a hour


[11/15/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean fix directly in the note


[11/15/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
going back to this - i would write it as defaults to family unless displayDefaults.primaryOrgType is defined


[11/15/2023 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
but if you have a templater to generate yaml for a new note, I'd have it set displayDefaults.primaryOrgType : family for people


[11/15/2023 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
then at some point if we want we can either manually or via code update the ones missing the default (in case we want to do something like make more org types, e.g. dynasty vs family or something)


[11/15/2023 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
honestly timelineDescriptor could also be in displayDefaults, with a default value of name if missing


[11/15/2023 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i would prefer to keep as much "display control" things in displayDefaults to avoid metadata clutter, it does look way nice with minimal metadata

(probably name.titlecase actually)


[11/15/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
Pushing two changes:

1.  A fix to the delete bug in regen
2. A special case for uni in my "an" vs "a" handler


[11/15/2023 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
playing around, I'd actually prefer that locations either all be title case or never title case, in "a city in XXX" and in whereabouts


[11/15/2023 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
this looks kind of weird to me:

[11/15/2023 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
See in that one shouldn't it just be

the Chasa River Valley, Chardonian Empire

?


[11/15/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
probably not worth worrying too much about little details


[11/15/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
but happy for title case to propogate onward. Just change get_LocationByPieces in metadatautils to pass titleCase in the recursive call rather than always passing true


[11/15/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
this also looks a bit weird IMO:

[11/15/2023 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
true


[11/15/2023 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
generally I like notes to be The XXXX as the title as well


[11/15/2023 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., The Chardonian Empire as opposed to Chardonian Empire


[11/15/2023 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I guess that's true


[11/15/2023 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
having "The XXX" as the name: and XXX as the file solves a lot of display issues


[11/15/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
well, "the XXX" as the name

{Reactions}
👍

[11/15/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
that's what I mean


[11/15/2023 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/15/2023 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
should we add thurh to dwarves like ka for elves?


[11/15/2023 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
leaning towards just making it an affiliation


[11/15/2023 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so playing around a bit, noticing a few things:

1. always creating links for any text may not be the best idea. for locations, there are a lot of people with location information like "plains west of Tokra" or "somewhere in the Feywild". e.g., look at Cloudspinner, those links are pretty cluttered. for organizations, it is probably safer


[11/15/2023 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
2. I'm not sure that using name to store appropriate definte article in non-title case is correct


[11/15/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
3. some (many?) organizations have leaders, and it is nice to be able to use the leaderOf for these, but the end result is a bit cluttered:

[11/15/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., you duplicate "Ruler of" and "Member of", and those are both fixed text


[11/15/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
theoretically you could fix most of this by using displayDefaults more heavily, where pretty much any text in the header can be overwritten with displayDefaults (but has sensible defaults in most cases to avoid needing to set displayDefaults for everything)


[11/15/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
but since most of this is not live, and most people won't have headers updated all that frequently, i'm not sure how much effort it is worth putting into programmatically customizing everything


[11/15/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I think for now what I'd propose is:
1. document what  metadata affects header text (e.g., if leaderOf exists, displays text "Rule of [[XXXX]]")
2. use it for a while and get a sense of what QoL improvements would be worthwhile
3. update


[11/15/2023 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
The main use of programmatic customization is that it is faster to hit ATL-W / ALT-R then to type


[11/15/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/15/2023 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but if it is only 5 people it affects the amount of time is not worth it


[11/15/2023 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
(or whatever your hotkeys are)


[11/15/2023 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
unless you enjoy the programming


[11/15/2023 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
well, if it only takes 90 seconds to fix the Javascript...


[11/15/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
fair enough


[11/15/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess my feeling would be that the "standard" should be any display text in the header should a) have a sensible default, and b) check displayDefaults to see if there is an override


[11/15/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
you could use this also for definite articles, for example, set the default as "the" for places/organizations, "" for people/items with displayDefaults.article overriding


[11/15/2023 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
The changes I'd propose for the next 10 min at least are:
* Before processing affiliations, remove any that are also in the leaderOf list, using exact text match
* Change locations so that any location with the word "in" or "of" doesn't auto-link unless it matches a place


[11/15/2023 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
add "somewhere, unknown" to the auto-linking exclusions


[11/15/2023 3:51 PM] .deciusmus
what I should do is move some of these things to metadata.json


[11/15/2023 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, the no-autolinking stuff especially would be best there


[11/15/2023 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
documenting a few more bugs, can try to fix a few myself tonight:

the TypeError is because of missing displayDefaults I assume but not sure why Owner: undefined


[11/15/2023 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
here is another one where having a "definite article" displayDefault would be nice, this should ideally say "maker: The Bahrazel" imo

[11/15/2023 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
wonder if it is worth having rarity tag for items? either using traditional dnd: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, legendary, artifact or something else


[11/15/2023 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea behind the unique tag is that there are some items of which there are many copies in the world, e.g. phasing stones or sending stones, and you might want a page for both the "general" version and the specific (likely campaign - related) version. e.g. for phasing stones I have the general page but might also want a "Vindristjarna's phasing stones" page


[11/15/2023 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so one could extent partOf logic here as well, e.g., "Vindristjarna's phasing stone" is partOf "phasing stones"


[11/15/2023 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
then you could link back to the generic version, perhaps even embedding the note e.g. with ![[generic]]


[11/15/2023 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
in other cases it is not worth tracking the individual versions, e.g. Kenzo's and Wellby's driftglobes on party treasure, or various sending stones, but you might want a link on party treasure to a generic "sending stone" page


[11/15/2023 4:51 PM] .deciusmus
I'm moving some stuff to metadata.json (which is shared, I believe)


[11/15/2023 4:52 PM] .deciusmus
But JavaScript async methods don't seem to always play well with inline dataview


[11/15/2023 4:52 PM] .deciusmus
So I had to implement a customJS initialization function to load the metadata into a static cache so I didn't need to await any time I needed it


[11/15/2023 4:53 PM] .deciusmus
So with my next push you will need to change your customJS configuration to set the "Startup script" to init

{Reactions}
👍

[11/15/2023 4:53 PM] .deciusmus
Also, changes to metadata.json will require an Obisidian restart


[11/15/2023 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
but in exchange you get:
    "placeNameFragmentsThatSkipAutoLinking" : ["somewhere", "unknown", "of", "in"],


[11/15/2023 4:56 PM] .deciusmus
pushed


[11/15/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
Fixed


[11/15/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
Where would this displayDefault be?


[11/15/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
on the Bahazeral page?


[11/15/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
Oh, ok. But why have a unique tag? Why not just have an oneOf: x


[11/15/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
So for items I would do:

1. Get rid of unique
2. Add an optional oneOf or typeOf or instanceOf tag to the item header
3. If the item has a instanceOf we add

(a [[instanceOf]])


[11/15/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
i.e.

# Vindristjarna's phasing stones
(magical item)
maker: Hlrogar
created DR 1522
(a [[Phasing Stone]])


[11/15/2023 5:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah, I think in this case you’d get the display default for the page you are linking


[11/15/2023 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
But not everything that is not unique has an instanxeOf page to link to


[11/15/2023 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
Unique vs not is important for magic item worldbuilding


[11/15/2023 5:09 PM] rsulfuratus
Although maybe there is a better way to tag that


[11/15/2023 5:10 PM] rsulfuratus
On some level every item that has a page is unique, the worldbuilding question is “are there other things that function like this out there”


[11/15/2023 5:10 PM] rsulfuratus
It is largely just for consistency, I want some way to tag the floating disc coin as “lots of these”


[11/15/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
But the unique true/false is maybe a clumsy way to do this


[11/15/2023 5:12 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I see, you want to distinguish between:

* this is an specific instance of a magic item, there are others like it out there, but I don't feel like writing up a page on the generic item, or it is too boring to bother
* this is a specific instance of a magic item, there are others like it out there, and the general type of item (sending stones) is something I actually have lore about, so I want to create a page for the generic item
* this is a specific instance of a magic item, and it is unique. It has a distinct history and there are certainly not others out there


[11/15/2023 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
instanceOf: works well for the 2nd case, but lack of instanceOf doesn't let you distinguish between 1 and 3


[11/15/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
Exactly


[11/15/2023 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
Unless you have a “generic” instanceOf that doesn’t auto link and perhaps doesn’t even display but can be used in queries


[11/15/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
The advantage of unique is that the default generally should be 1


[11/15/2023 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
Update on leaderOf:
1. Will now skip outputting to Member of: x or "of X" blocks anything you are a leader of
2. Supports (for edge cases) a displayDefaults.leaders array of the form:
leaders: [{ name: Army of the West, title: Commander }]

The name is the name of the organization/place and the title is the title


[11/15/2023 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
Let's you potentially do, for complex cases:

displayDefaults: { leaders: [{ name: Army of the West, title: Commander },{ name: Tyrwingha, title: Princess } ]}


[11/15/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus

[11/15/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
What is the advantage of rarity tag? I think I'd for game purposes have it on a mechanics page


[11/15/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think you'd usually care to query or see it on the main page


[11/15/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
re: items. can't think of a use case for rarity so probably better to leave untouched for now


[11/15/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
was just idlely thinking


[11/15/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
For items, how about:

* unique: true / false
* typeOf or instanceOf: optional

Output is:

(unique magical item) if unique is true
(magical item type) if unique is false


[11/15/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
instanceOf: <anything> implies unique


[11/15/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
and changes the line to:

(unique magical <instanceOf> [mechanics])


[11/15/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that works


[11/15/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Where instance of is not auto-linked, but is linked if it exists


[11/15/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
default parsing should assume unique is False if not present, which i presume is how it works


[11/15/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
so:

- magical: true 
(magical item)

-magical: true
-unique: true
(unique magical item)

-magical: true
-typeOf: sending stone
(unique magical sending stone)

-magical: true
-unique: false
-typeOf: sending stone
magical sending stone

(but probably last case is never wanted?)


[11/15/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
the generic sending stone page would just be:
magical: true


[11/15/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm


[11/15/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess I'd probably not display unique for typeOf: <case>


[11/15/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
It feels sensible but looking at the Treasure stuff you have for our game, it is not clear it is right


[11/15/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
you really only want three cases as you outlined before


[11/15/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. 
# Ring of Jumping

A ring of a Drankorian design, a twisted silver hare motif. Gift from [[Havdar]], in exchange for the [[Spear of the War Leader]].


[11/15/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
what is the right thing to set?  just unique: false I guess?


[11/15/2023 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that is a specific instance of a generic thing


[11/15/2023 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
this is "this is an specific instance of a magic item, there are others like it out there, but I don't feel like writing up a page on the generic item, or it is too boring to bother"


[11/15/2023 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i actually thing unique is the wrong frame


[11/15/2023 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
you want:

typeOf: generic
typeOf: <something>
typeOf: unique


[11/15/2023 5:40 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/15/2023 5:40 PM] .deciusmus
that is much better


[11/15/2023 5:40 PM] rsulfuratus
if I wanted for some reason to tag all magical shields for a query, you could use typeOf: shield


[11/15/2023 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
ah, I see


[11/15/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
since it isn't autolinked doesn't matter if a page doesn't exist


[11/15/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
generic is just a special keyword that doesn't display


[11/15/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
as is unique


[11/15/2023 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
so Ring of Jumping would be:

either

typeOf: ring or
typeOf: generic


[11/15/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
Or is generic meant to imply "this is a category"


[11/15/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. it is a kind of item, rather than a specific item


[11/15/2023 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
no, generic implies "i don't even care what category this is"


[11/15/2023 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
you could do this with displayDefaults instead


[11/15/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
ah, ok


[11/15/2023 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., showType: False


[11/15/2023 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
or just leave typeOf blank


[11/15/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
or just not show if it is blank


[11/15/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/15/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
that is is probably easier


[11/15/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
So, what do you set the typeOf for the generic page on phasing stones


[11/15/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
wonderous item or nothing


[11/15/2023 5:43 PM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[11/15/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, from a query perspective, you only care about 1+2 vs 3 for in-game lore


[11/15/2023 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
you care about 1 vs 2 only for note building


[11/15/2023 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
but you can easily make a dataview query that lists all items with typeOf != unique and not blank


[11/15/2023 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
that is your "what notes should I work on query"


[11/15/2023 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
typeOf == unique is your "these are special items query"


[11/15/2023 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
so really only "unique" is a special reserved word


[11/15/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
So basically.

If typeOf: unique we generate a header like

(unique magical item)

If typeOf is blank, we generate

(magical item)

If typeOf is anything else, we generate

(magical <typeOf>) and link typeOf only if it is a valid link


[11/15/2023 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/15/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
which is really to say, the default typeOf is "item"


[11/15/2023 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/15/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
I think I'm going to make magical: true the default


[11/15/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
almost everything worth having a note on is going to be magical


[11/15/2023 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
agreed


[11/15/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
so I'll change it to

mundane: true


[11/15/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
required to make it non-magical

[11/15/2023 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
btw I'm looking at adding the ability to get a definitive article from the displayDefaults of the page you are building a descriptiveName for in your get_Name function


[11/15/2023 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
doesn't seem that hard. only question is - do you ever get a name for something that has a definitive article where you wouldn't want it to be added to the descriptiveName?


[11/15/2023 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
logic is:
if article in displayDefaults, use that
else if organization or place in tags, add "the"
else blank


[11/15/2023 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
you don't want to default to add "the" for places


[11/15/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
The Cleenseau, The Sembara are both wrong


[11/15/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
The Tollen


[11/15/2023 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
right, probably more places with no definitive article


[11/15/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
The Chardon


[11/15/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
the right heuristic is whether it has >1 word


[11/15/2023 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/15/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
not always correct but relatively close


[11/15/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
maybe default to the for > 1 word, not for 1 word, and wrong guesses can be fixed in display defaults


[11/15/2023 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
yes I think that is correct


[11/15/2023 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
the other question is with capitalization, would need to either code whether it should be returned upper/lower, or add a option to titleCase to handle first word


[11/15/2023 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
titleCase already title-cases the first word if it is true


[11/15/2023 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[11/15/2023 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right because we just didn't use titleCase for "Chardon, the Chardonian Empire" location strings


[11/15/2023 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. 

the Green Sea in title case is The Green Sea

but 

Green Legs of the West in title case is Green Legs of the West


[11/15/2023 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
so you should always return article lowercase and just use titleCase if you want titleCase


[11/15/2023 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/15/2023 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
and probably the only function that cares is the get_Name, right? you use that for location parsing?


[11/15/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
get_Name is ultimately called by everything that starts with a raw string, turns it into a file link, and then gets the name


[11/15/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
so should be good


[11/15/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
to only change things there


[11/15/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
it is also called to generate the header


[11/15/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
the H1 header on the page


[11/15/2023 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
great


[11/15/2023 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
So actually with this, we'd probably want to just say that 
name: frontmatter and also filename should never have articles


[11/15/2023 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/15/2023 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
unless it is integral to the name


[11/15/2023 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
you probably need to handle displayDefaults.definitiveArticle: ""


[11/15/2023 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that is plan


[11/15/2023 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
as distinct from undefined


[11/15/2023 6:06 PM] .deciusmus

Is Eudomes' mirror typeOf: unique or typeOf: mirror


[11/15/2023 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
hmmm. actually I've never decided


[11/15/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
It feels important to have a typeOf: mirror so we can add a dataview query for all of the mirrors


[11/15/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
When we go on our side quest to collect all the magical mirrors in taelgar


[11/15/2023 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
it is probably not the only history-revealing mirror ever to exist so typeOf: mirror seems better


[11/15/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
I actually wonder if rarity: unique is better than typeOf: unique


[11/15/2023 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah was just thinking that


[11/15/2023 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
you still sometimes want typeOf for unique things e.g. to query all the magic mirrors in Taelgar


[11/15/2023 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
frontmatter could just be:
rarity magical/mundane typeOf

{Reactions}
👍

[11/15/2023 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
rarity defaults to nothing


[11/15/2023 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
typeOf to item


[11/15/2023 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
magical/mundane to magical


[11/15/2023 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
do you trim excess whitespace before printing descriptiveName or should I?


[11/15/2023 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I should


[11/15/2023 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
you should


[11/15/2023 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
I like rarity, you can do stuff like:

what's your code to tell if a page is a person with tags?


[11/15/2023 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
I'm just checking if tags.startsWith(person)


[11/15/2023 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
sorry


[11/15/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
tags.filter(t => t.startsWith(person)).length > 0


[11/15/2023 6:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I hate how javascript handles undefined


[11/15/2023 6:28 PM] rsulfuratus
is there a simple way to tell if a key exists, but not care if it is defined? e.g., distinguish these two key2:
{ key1: , key2: }
{ key1: }


[11/15/2023 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
no


[11/15/2023 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
not that I know of


[11/15/2023 6:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yuck


[11/15/2023 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
why do you care?


[11/15/2023 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
key2: "" vs key2: should be detectable via key2 == undefined vs key2 == ""


[11/15/2023 6:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I wanted to treat { definitiveArticle: } and { definitiveArticle: ""} the same


[11/15/2023 6:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but it doesn't really matter if you can't


[11/15/2023 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
I don't know of any way to do that, but I don't really know javascript


[11/15/2023 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
maybe null vs undefined


[11/15/2023 6:32 PM] .deciusmus
yup


[11/15/2023 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
displayDefaults: {startStatus: born, x: , y: "", startPrefix: b., endPrefix: d., endStatus: died}


[11/15/2023 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
displayDefaults.x == null


[11/15/2023 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
displayDefaults.z == undefined


[11/15/2023 6:34 PM] .deciusmus
nope


[11/15/2023 6:34 PM] .deciusmus
aha


[11/15/2023 6:34 PM] .deciusmus
use the magic ===


[11/15/2023 6:34 PM] .deciusmus
triple equals


[11/15/2023 6:34 PM] .deciusmus
meaning "actually compare" rather than "randomly guess"


[11/15/2023 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
oh java


[11/15/2023 6:35 PM] .deciusmus
```null == undefined
true
null === undefined
false
```


[11/15/2023 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
actually the bug was different


[11/15/2023 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
key in dict does actually return true for both null and undefined


[11/15/2023 6:36 PM] .deciusmus
don't think of javascript objects as dictionaries


[11/15/2023 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
just dot into things


[11/15/2023 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
don't use dictionary syntax


[11/15/2023 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
ah but my problem was that, frontmatter.displayDefaults.article throws an error if frontmatter.displayDefaults doesn't exist


[11/15/2023 6:38 PM] .deciusmus
x?.

ah nice chatgpt didn't find that one for me


[11/15/2023 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
I actually didn't know that per se, it is just a C# feature that I just tried in Javascript and it worked


[11/15/2023 6:42 PM] rsulfuratus
ah that doesn't actually work


[11/15/2023 6:43 PM] rsulfuratus
doesn't return


[11/15/2023 6:43 PM] rsulfuratus
you need to use "key in dict" if you want to return true if and only if the key is present no matter what the value


[11/15/2023 6:43 PM] rsulfuratus
at least nothing else I've tried works


[11/15/2023 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
except then it returns "Null The Thirsty Scholar" if definitiveArticle:


[11/15/2023 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
and "The Thirsty Scholar" if definitiveArticle: ""


[11/15/2023 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
this seems to do the right thing:

```
    get_DisplayArticle(metadata) {
        if (metadata.displayDefaults) {
            let article = metadata.displayDefaults.article
            if (article === null) return "blank"
            if (article === undefined) return "default"
            if (article == "") return "blank"
            return article
        }

        return "default"
    }
```


[11/15/2023 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
on my test page it seems to return blank vs default as you expect


[11/15/2023 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
this works:
```java

        if (input.frontmatter.displayDefaults && "definitiveArticle" in input.frontmatter.displayDefaults) {
            // we have a page override, use as is
            // if null or undefined or blank, don't add anything
            if (input.frontmatter.displayDefaults.definitiveArticle) descriptiveName = input.frontmatter.displayDefaults.definitiveArticle + " " + descriptiveName;
            else descriptiveName = descriptiveName;
        }
```


[11/15/2023 6:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but i'm changing it to return article so I can link to just the page not the [[article page|page]]


[11/15/2023 6:52 PM] rsulfuratus
almost done


[11/15/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed my definitive article code, just need to clean up title case usage now. i'd say title case for:
H1
Member Of:

Not title case for:
maker/owner
location strings
"of XXX" for primary org


[11/15/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
actually, maybe yes title case for Maker/Owern


[11/15/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
*Owner


[11/15/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
don't really care about that one, just would like non-title case for location


[11/15/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I can probably track it down


[11/15/2023 7:53 PM] rsulfuratus
also, do you care about:
The [[file]] vs [[the file|file]]


[11/15/2023 7:53 PM] rsulfuratus
I have the first right now which I think looks better in location strings but might look worse in Member Of:


[11/15/2023 7:53 PM] .deciusmus
I prefer the [[file]] I think


[11/15/2023 7:54 PM] .deciusmus
But maybe in some cases the t will not look at good


[11/15/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
can tweak if desired. honestly for Member Of: you might not even want the article, e.g. 
Member Of: Society of the Open Scroll, Great Library, University of Chardon
vs
Member Of: The Society of the Open Scroll, The Great Library, The University of Chardon


[11/15/2023 7:55 PM] rsulfuratus
both look fine to me but with links I think the first will look better


[11/15/2023 7:58 PM] rsulfuratus
added: `get_Name(input, link, titleCase, returnArticle = true)`


[11/15/2023 7:58 PM] rsulfuratus
if you want to generate a name without the article for some reason


[11/15/2023 7:59 PM] rsulfuratus
returnArticle = false just sets the article to "" no matter what is the in the file or the defaults

{Reactions}
👍

[11/15/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
"of XXX" definitely looks much better as

of the [[XXX]]


[11/15/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
makes all my Sembaran royalty look much nicer


[11/15/2023 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
looks like it is working from my testing. i just pushed the returnArticle=false update and changed location have consistent titleCase across all pieces (currently all set to false)

{Reactions}
👍

[11/15/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
there is one bug I don't fully understand - if the partOf page doesn't exist, it doesn't properly set defaults based on number of words


[11/15/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
what's an example

well, wait


[11/15/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't call get_Name if there is no file


[11/15/2023 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I just saw that


[11/15/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
I guess it should


[11/15/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
but really, the code should be restructured


[11/15/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
there should be a 

get_Name(targetFilename, metadata, link, titleCase)


[11/15/2023 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
then the whole mapping for 
let fileName = blah blah blah goes away


[11/15/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to do a bit of refactoring


[11/15/2023 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
Refactoring makes sense but actually I think not returning articles for non-files is fine, it is such as edge case


[11/15/2023 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/15/2023 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not even touching that code


[11/15/2023 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
for the moment I'm just getting rid of all the old whereabouts stuff


[11/15/2023 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
and date stuff


[11/15/2023 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
so that DateManager manages dates and WhereaboutsManager manages whereabouts


[11/15/2023 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
I'd actually like metadataUtils to just be short functions for helping with dataview queries

Wait did you intend title case for locations?


[11/15/2023 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
no, I thought I changed that


[11/15/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I changed the get location by pieces to use the titleCase variable for everything but this should be false from the original function call


[11/15/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
but only tested for partOf, not sure how it interacts with dview calls


[11/15/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus

I also fixed the bug where NPCs get "The" added if they have > 1 word in name


[11/15/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm using, roughly:
status/uptodate - I don't think there is anything more to add until more detail is invented
status/draft - think this is pretty good but could use review
status/wip - some initial notes or cleaning
status/notes - extensive notes (from e.g., Google Drive or similar) that have not been incorporated, although I haven't been checking google drive to confirm stuff has been copied
status/stub - minimal detail, often just a summary box


[11/15/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
these are not hard and fast categories


[11/15/2023 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
for "my" NPCs I assume you wouldn't edit much, for gazetteer stuff feel free to change tags if it is a region you feel comfortable on


[11/15/2023 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
once the initial round of header updates stabilizes, it will be easy to use recent changes + status tags to review, e.g., recent status/uptodate to get things to review


[11/15/2023 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
That sounds good


[11/15/2023 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed another round of bug fixes


[11/15/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
the auto place linking doesn't work by alias, or at least doesn't seem to. i assume this is tricky to do


[11/15/2023 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
That is correct, it needs "real" filenames

[11/15/2023 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
I dont know if there is a good way to find a place by alias


[11/15/2023 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't looked at the obisidan api very carefully


[11/15/2023 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
you almost never want to actually link to the alias, and it is find to edit by hand if you do, I think


[11/15/2023 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
just was curious, e.g., Kunda (stoneborn village) should be a village in the Indalas not a village in the Sentinel Range


[11/15/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I put Taelgar as the partOf for a few top level regions, but not sure if I like that...


[11/15/2023 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
I really like the summary boxes for places, though, because for a lot of stubs all you really want is the summary box information. makes the stubs look neat and organized


[11/15/2023 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I am also trying to tag comments, e.g., %% notes %% vs %% detail %%


[11/15/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
last comment for tonight - I'm using status/stub to mean "nothing much has been made up about the subject of this note" and status/needswork to mean "there is detail about the subject of this note somewhere - email, session notes, google drive, our heads -- that isn't captured in obsidian"


[11/15/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
generally status/stub then don't need work, it is status/needswork, status/notes, and status/wip that need work


[11/16/2023 8:25 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed a region and climate map (png, leaflet versions in worldbuilding, coords might be wrong). they are huge, will try to shrink for loading speed when I have more time

[11/16/2023 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
I am mostly working today, but took a few minutes to do a bit of refactoring...

I implemented a "getFileFromTarget" method that will, given a string, return the "best match" file or undefined.
1) If there is an exact link (i.e. if [[target]] would work) it returns the exact link
2) otherwise, if there is a file with an alias, it returns the first one that matches (if you have 2 people with an alias of Robin it will return the first one it finds)
3) otherwise, it looks at a "filemap" structure in the metadata.json that looks like 

``` "filemap": [
        {
            "name": "Mike",
            "file": "Delwath"
        },
```

The filemap is intended to be used to allow you to map terms (like say DuFr or clee) to a file without having those terms clutter up the alias namespace. Main uses are expected to be replacing the "campaigns" structure and potentially linking players to PCs, or providing short names for frontmatter for long names


[11/16/2023 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
I also implemented a new getName which takes:
* a target string
* a linkType (never, always, exists)
* a case (title, default)

And returns the right thing (i.e. something like [[x]] or x or [[name|x]] or whatever)


[11/16/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
The main question is do you see any value in the campaign data? Right now it is just used to lookup the name for "clee" or "DuFr" for "last met by party" but I'd rather just use the name of the party page instead


[11/16/2023 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
Then I would also get rid of the species and culture descriptor and we could either add aliases to the target pages or just use the file map


[11/16/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I don’t think there is any value in the campaign data


[11/16/2023 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
Slight spec update:

* "linkmap" { "from" : string, "to" : fileThatExists, "isAlias": true | false }


[11/16/2023 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Behavior:

Assume a file: Something with aliases Thing and Some and definitive article of "the"
Assume 2 linkmap entries :  { "from" : "st, "to" : "Something",  "isAlias":  false } &&   { "from" : "Special Something", "to" : "Something",  "isAlias":  true }

getName("st") => "the [[Something]]"
getName("Something") => "the [[Something]]"
getName("Thing") => "[[Thing|Something]]"
getName("Some") => "[[Some|Something]]"
getName("Special Something") => "[[Special Something|Something]]"


[11/16/2023 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
So basically:

If your frontmatter (i.e. partOf: x) is an alias, you get

a village in [Alias|Real]


[11/16/2023 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
We **don't** apply definitive articles to aliases, as it isn't clear the make sense


[11/16/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
You can in theory get slightly weird cases, i.e. if Open Scroll Hunters is an aliases for Society of the Open Scroll then  adding leaderOf: Open Scroll Hunters will generate

Leader of Open Scroll Hunters instead of
Leader of the Open Scroll Hunters


[11/16/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
but I think fixing that is too complicated


[11/16/2023 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
that seems fine. it is less typing to add an article than to modify the link to generate an alias, and if there are a few random slightly grammatically incorrect pages no one will care


[11/16/2023 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
adding a few little bits to region notes during the day and realizing at some point I probably need to decide if Taelgar is the world or the continent....


[11/16/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
I think its definitely the world


[11/16/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
Hkar was on Taelgar


[11/16/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
The mariners who sailed across the endless ocean were on Taelgar


[11/16/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
I just think no one has a world for the continent because no one has any reason to think about it


[11/16/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
I guess the first humans would have had a world for it


[11/16/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
where did they sail to from Hkar? I don't think they were sailing from Hkar to Taelgar, they were on Taelgar sailing from Hkar to (??)

[11/16/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I’m going to add a note on this


[11/16/2023 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
I am going to push a massive refactor of the Javascript code


[11/16/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
It is dramatically cleaned up. Take a look at the metadata.json that I will be pushing (in the .obisidian folder) -- it is shared, but lets you tweak some things now (mostly the default displayDefaults per type) but I'm moving towards putting more text in there (i.e. eventually I want to move a lot of the format strings into metadata.json)


[11/16/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
If you see casing decisions or "max pieces" for locations you don't like, should be pretty straightforward to fix


[11/16/2023 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
great


[11/16/2023 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
really it would be ideal if basically all the format strings were set in a json file by type, individually override-able by displayDefaults. then you could just delete displayDefaults entirely unless you want a non-default value. really I guess should be called displayOverrides then or something


[11/16/2023 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
python code could also then read from same json to get consistent formatting


[11/16/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
A few quick notes then I need to go make dinner:

1. Use partOf to chain things together. For example, you can set a halfling boat to be "partOf" an ocean, and a halfling to have their whereabouts location the boat, and you will get: Current location: [[Wave Dancer]], the [[Green Sea]]
2. Same deal with items. The people who current location is set to Mirror of Soul Trapping will correctly backlink to the item page (you could have an item by partOf something else
3. You can even set items to be part of other items. For example, if you set Mirror of Soul Trapping to be part of Vindristjarna then Antonia's location becomes:  [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], [[Vindristjarna]] 

I set the default for definitiveArticle (in metadata.json) to be "" for person and default pages.  That can be changed per page or in the metadata.json. We don't process articles for links that don't match a page


[11/16/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
what functions call partOf chains? these are currently just used to construct location (for person/whereabouts and place)


[11/16/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
?


[11/16/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
reason for question is figuring out when it is even useful to add partOf to something atypical


[11/16/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., it does nothing if you set phasing stones to be partOf Vindristjarna, unless a person is in a phasing stone or a place is partOf a phasing stone


[11/16/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, anything a place or a person could occupy could be cool to add partOf information to, but it is more-or-less meaningless for things a person or place can't/don't occupy


[11/16/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
the use case for vehicles, though, is very cool


[11/16/2023 6:53 PM] .deciusmus
Currently partOf is only used for locations (so whereabouts type info plus “party met” lines)


[11/16/2023 6:56 PM] .deciusmus
It’s pretty trivial to change things to follow the chain


[11/16/2023 7:09 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at your javascript refactor


[11/16/2023 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
with things organized the way they are, I think the best way to handle the python code is to let chatgpt translate each javascript class and then rewrite functions to replicate the obsidian api calls.


[11/16/2023 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
in the nameManager, they look pretty simple


[11/16/2023 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
But I think broadly there are probably 4 types of relationships:
- partOf
- whereabouts
- typeOf
- memberOf

I think your phasing stone example is actually whereabouts.


[11/16/2023 7:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i think fundamentally there are three relationships:
1. whereabouts, which tells you where something is in relationship to the fixed world
2. partOf, which tells you the hierarchy of names for a fixed point
3. typeOf (of which memberOf is a special category), which tells you what larger thing this thing is a specific example of


[11/16/2023 7:18 PM] rsulfuratus
however, in some cases it probably makes sense to use partOf to track location, instead of whereabouts, because it is simpler


[11/16/2023 7:19 PM] rsulfuratus
formally, an item like mirror of soul trapping shouldn't be partOf anything, it should have a whereabouts; same with a ship


[11/16/2023 7:20 PM] rsulfuratus
so formally if your whereabouts are in something that itself has a whereabouts, you should get the current location of the "parent", and then follow the partOf chain up


[11/16/2023 7:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so in the complicated setup of Antonia, you could have:
- Antonia's current location is Mirror of Soul Trapping
- Mirror of Soul Trapping's current location is Vindristjarna
- Vindristjarna's current location is LakeOutsideOrenlas
- LakeOutsideOrenlas is partOf Cymean Peninsula, which is partOf Western Green Sea

So for Antonia you get:
current location: MIrror of Soul Trapping, Vindristjarna, LakeOutsideOrenlas, Cymean Peninsula, Western Green Sea Region


[11/16/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
However, the whole point of whereabouts is that we want to be able to separately track the location of people across time


[11/16/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
So a shared NPC can have a different location in 1720 and 1749


[11/16/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
it seems like for items, that is never going to happen


[11/16/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so using partOf as a simple what to implement a fixed whereabouts is probably a good, simple idea


[11/16/2023 7:25 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, you can overload partOf as a way to track a single fixed location for something, which probably covers all the important use cases


[11/16/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
the alernative would be to use whereabouts, but basically assume that items can never go on trips, they just move homes


[11/16/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so you can never have an unknown current location, you always have a current home


[11/16/2023 7:27 PM] rsulfuratus
or maybe the code is organized neatly enough that there is no reason not to just check - does a page have partOf? if yes grab that page, if no check does page have whereabouts? if yes grab current location, if no stop


[11/16/2023 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
and just repeat for each step up the chain


[11/16/2023 7:30 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly just having a single whereabouts with type home and no dates is fine. Esp if I add a displayOverrides for home


[11/16/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
So then you could have mirror show as “in” or “stored in” Vindistraja


[11/16/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
Using whereabouts


[11/16/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
But then really we are saying that things that are moveable have whereabouts and things that are fixed have partOf


[11/16/2023 7:32 PM] .deciusmus
And “location” just follows the chain


[11/16/2023 7:33 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, the implication is that having both a partOf and a whereabouts is an error, although I would say in that case you follow the partOf chain


[11/16/2023 7:35 PM] rsulfuratus
but honestly each header generation could just check:
if a page has partOf, generate a location chain from the partOf and display the "a <typeOf> in partOf1, partOf2, partOf3"
if a page has whereabouts, generate the get_whereabouts line


[11/16/2023 7:36 PM] rsulfuratus
you actually might not ever need to really check type


[11/16/2023 7:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Owner: Beryl could just be tracked by:
whereabouts: [ { type= "home", location = "Beryl" } ]


[11/16/2023 7:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean this might be a lot of work to refactor for not much benefit


[11/16/2023 7:41 PM] .deciusmus
I like reducing special cases


[11/16/2023 7:42 PM] rsulfuratus
it would be a lot of fun to add all the whereabouts for e.g. the scepter of command - apollyon -> "lost" -> werewolf dude -> agata -> delwath -> wellby


[11/16/2023 7:43 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/16/2023 7:43 PM] .deciusmus
I think it’s fine to have whereabouts for items instead of owners


[11/16/2023 7:44 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly I think basically the idea is that anything can have a whereabouts in which case we add a whereabouts script


[11/16/2023 7:44 PM] .deciusmus
Anything can instead have a partOf in which case we generate a static part of line


[11/16/2023 7:45 PM] .deciusmus
You can go from whereabouts -> part of but not part of -> whereabouts


[11/16/2023 7:45 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that would be the idea


[11/16/2023 7:47 PM] .deciusmus
The placeType is removed in favor of a displayDefaults


[11/16/2023 7:47 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, a header is three kinds of things:
type specific static text
a whereabouts line if whereabouts exist || a partOf line if partOf exists
a page dated line if dates exist (+ regnal dates line if regnal dates exist)


[11/16/2023 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
maker/owner is just origin/home


[11/16/2023 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
org "Based in: " is just whereabouts home


[11/16/2023 7:48 PM] .deciusmus
Right I guess an org could move


[11/16/2023 7:49 PM] rsulfuratus
could even have orgs that move:
Omnis Pura
Originally based in: Drankor, Drankorian Empire
Based in: Chardon, Chardonian Empire


[11/16/2023 7:49 PM] rsulfuratus
Organizations can have whereabouts or partOf but not both


[11/16/2023 7:50 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm actually you might want both


[11/16/2023 7:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I think you don't care if something has both a whereabouts and a partOf


[11/16/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
just, when you follow a location chain, you follow partOf if it exists, and only check for whereabouts if partOf doesn't exist


[11/16/2023 7:51 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/16/2023 7:51 PM] .deciusmus
Although I’m not sure that is right


[11/16/2023 7:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but you also probably want a displayDefault to override following location chain


[11/16/2023 7:51 PM] .deciusmus
Im not sure the use case for both actually


[11/16/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus

[11/16/2023 7:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure I can think of a real organization that has this property


[11/16/2023 7:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but if we are eliminating special cases, you don't want basedIn, you just want a home whereabouts


[11/16/2023 7:54 PM] rsulfuratus
so actually all the sembaran army stuff would need both a whereabouts and a partOf


[11/16/2023 7:54 PM] .deciusmus
I agree org should have a whereabouts for its location but Im not sure about part of


[11/16/2023 7:55 PM] rsulfuratus
you were the one who wanted partOf to track the sembaran army subunits originally


[11/16/2023 7:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Anyway, I think the generic header is:
```markdown
# DisplayName
*(pronunciation)*
>[!info] BOXNAME
> TYPE-SPECIFIC TEXT
> pagedated if it exists
> partOf if it exists [static line, not auto-generated]
> whereabouts if it exists
```


[11/16/2023 7:59 PM] rsulfuratus
oh, add: 
Campaign info if exists at the end


[11/16/2023 7:59 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., no reason you can't have "Last visited on:" for a place if you want, but probably I wouldn't bother for most things


[11/16/2023 8:00 PM] rsulfuratus
campaign is static line


[11/16/2023 8:00 PM] rsulfuratus
pagedated includes regnal values


[11/16/2023 8:04 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Forgot about that


[11/16/2023 8:04 PM] rsulfuratus
actually, you could disallow partOf for organizations by allowing organizations to have affiliations maybe


[11/16/2023 8:04 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking it might be cleaner to have@something like that


[11/16/2023 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
actually if you did that you could dramatically simplify header generation, because you (almost) wouldn't care about type


[11/16/2023 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
the only thing that would have special type-specific text would be items (for rarity / magical / typeOf) and people


[11/16/2023 8:06 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/16/2023 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
those are unique enough that it probably doesn't make sense to try to generalize


[11/16/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
then you just have:
- additional static line if partOf exists
- additional static line if affiliations exist
- dataview line if whereabouts exist
- dataview line if dates exist
- dataview line if reign information exists


[11/16/2023 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
actually, this would be really great. you could use partOf to represent also events - e.g., "a battle in the Great War"


[11/16/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
same concept - a fixed point in time is part of multiple events


[11/16/2023 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus
the key thing about partOf is that it is *fixed* - whether the battle of urlich pass is always a battle in the great war no matter your time reference


[11/16/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/16/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
I also think partOf implies a "same type" relationship


[11/16/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm really into the summary boxes because when I was cleaning up stubs I noticed that at least 50% of places really only need a summary box and one or two lines of text to capture all the relevant information about them


[11/16/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/16/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
I am not going to enforce it


[11/16/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
but logically an event can be part of an event


[11/16/2023 8:12 PM] .deciusmus
and an place can be part of a place


[11/16/2023 8:12 PM] .deciusmus
but an event shouldn't be part of a place


[11/16/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
right, because an event is a partOf in the time dimension, and a place is partOf in the space dimension


[11/16/2023 8:12 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/16/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but, in the feywild, an event could be part of a place


[11/16/2023 8:12 PM] .deciusmus
(We might also want a "whereabouts" for events)


[11/16/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
sunset is part of Amberglow


[11/16/2023 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure what a whereabouts for events would mean


[11/16/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
Where the event happened


[11/16/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
The whereabouts is the "location" of something


[11/16/2023 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay


[11/16/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder though if it would make sense to allow:

whereabouts: <string>


[11/16/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
as a shorthand


[11/16/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
for:

whereabouts:
- { type: home, location: <string> }


[11/16/2023 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would only be a few lines of code and would potentially save a lot of typing


[11/16/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
Sure


[11/16/2023 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I think if we allow whereabouts for events, we should assume by default that created = destroyed = DR, or if DR_end exists, created = DR, destroyed = DR_end


[11/16/2023 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
that will then allow timeline code to work without having to retype dates and still give you the "happened in the past" logic of whereabouts, e.g. "Happened in: " vs "Happening in: "


[11/16/2023 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
this would be nice for me since I have event pages for the siblings war (Sura vs Karnas) and the War of the Cloak (Grash vs orcs) that are "happening now" but at some point will be happening in the past


[11/16/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean it is a tiny display point but would be satisfying to see those change from "Occurring in: " to "Happened in: " as the campaign progresses automatically


[11/16/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/16/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
So I pushed

whereabouts: <string> as shorthand


[11/16/2023 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
I think to make this work nicely I need to write some code to generate the home/origin etc lines from displayDefaults


[11/16/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
so you don't get

lived in:


[11/16/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
for event-based whereabouts


[11/16/2023 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, and for maker/owner in items


[11/16/2023 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
you need a:
originText
alivehomeText
deadhomeText
currentLocationText


[11/16/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
I am not sure about currentLocationText


[11/16/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
isn't "current location" always accurate?


[11/16/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
(There is also Last Known)


[11/16/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
right, assuming we never use "away" whereabouts for anything that is not a person or an item


[11/16/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
which is probably a safe assumption


[11/16/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
right, if it isn't a moveable item it definitely shouldn't have away whereabouts


[11/16/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
what does it mean for it to be "away"


[11/16/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/16/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
(maybe a demi-plane has away whereabouts, but Current location: the Astral Plane seems fine in that case)


[11/16/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
although a secret organization could have an "Originally Based In: " / "Currently Based In: "


[11/16/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
sorry, Last Known:


[11/16/2023 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
but isn't Last Known location probably correct then?


[11/16/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, probably


[11/16/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess if I were doing it I'd just remove all hardcoded text strings and just load a json for everything


[11/16/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
some things can have global defaults


[11/16/2023 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
btw if you are mucking with metadata.json - you can add a hotkey to customJS to run the "init" script


[11/16/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
then if you hit the hotkey it reloads and you can see the effect of the new metadata.json


[11/16/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to define a new type: event which is anything with a DR or DR_end


[11/16/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
(or CY or CY_end, I guess)


[11/16/2023 8:30 PM] rsulfuratus
then you just replace defaults.displayItem with displayDefaults.displayItem


[11/16/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
to get display defaults


[11/16/2023 8:30 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, good

[11/16/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
an origin whereabouts for an event is weird, it implies an event happened in multiple places


[11/16/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
I guess it could have


[11/16/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
maybe Started in is bette


[11/16/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Started in for event origin yes


[11/16/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
shouldn't event have startPrefix = startStatus and same for end?


[11/16/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
or I guess the idea is:
1455 - 1470


[11/16/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, that


[11/16/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
oops but I mixed up endPrefix and endStatus


[11/16/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
so if you have an event with an end date but not a start date:
ended in 1450
with a start date but not an end date:
started in 1400
with both:
1400-1450


[11/16/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd make it "started in" and "ended in"

{Reactions}
👍

[11/16/2023 8:52 PM] .deciusmus
one day/one year moment in time events are a bit of a pain


[11/16/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
you have to say DR and DR_end to get an end date


[11/16/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder if we should assume DR_end = DR


[11/16/2023 8:53 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think you should


[11/16/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
probably


[11/16/2023 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
an event that is ongoing can probably just set DR_end to some far date in the future


[11/16/2023 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
only annoying thing would be auto-populating "Event ended" in timelines


[11/16/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
probably the most correct thing is to set DR_end if DR unless DR_end is null, in which case this is an ongoing event


[11/16/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
same logic as away whereabouts


[11/16/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
well, that isn't what whereabouts does


[11/16/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
but I can do the definite article tricky


[11/16/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
not coding logic


[11/16/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, right


[11/16/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
I see what you mean


[11/16/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
same logic in that undefined has meaning


[11/16/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to define 3 strings:

pagePastWithStart
pagePast
pageCurrent

Do you think there is any point in keeping startPrefix, startStatus or endPrefix?


[11/16/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
Separate endStatus I like because it is used in whereabouts when you are dead


[11/16/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
I guess we use start for events timelines


[11/16/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
But I think the prefixes are unnecesary


[11/16/2023 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
They are used for b. and d. in people pages aren’t they?


[11/16/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
"pageCurrent": "<start> <startDate> (<length> years old)",
            "pagePastWithStart": "b. <startDate> - d. <endDate>, <end> at age <length>",
            "pagePast": "<end> <endDate>"


[11/16/2023 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but that doesn't work


[11/16/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
why not?


[11/16/2023 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
or rather you mean you can change that whole string


[11/16/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/16/2023 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
you can set:
end and start to whatever


[11/16/2023 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
or the whole string


[11/16/2023 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
so you could do:

displayDefaults: { end: killed }

and you will get

b. <startDate> - d. <endDate>, killed  at age <length>


[11/16/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
or if you want something weird, you can do:
pagePastWithStart: "fell from heaven in <startDate> and was returned to hell in <endDate>"


[11/16/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
both in the frontmatter


[11/16/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
"pagePastWithStart": "b. <startDate> - d. <endDate>, <end> at age <length>" into 
 "pagePastWithStart": "<shortStart><startDate> - <shortEnd><endDate>, <end> at age <length>"


[11/16/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
ah see what you are saying now


[11/16/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
also, there is a metadata.json that sets the defaults for each type, i.e. item has:

            "pageCurrent": "<start> <startDate> (<length> years ago)",
            "pagePastWithStart": "<startDate> - <endDate>, <end> after <length> years",
            "pagePast": "<end> <endDate>"


[11/16/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
whereas person has:

            "pageCurrent": "<start> <startDate> (<length> years old)",
            "pagePastWithStart": "b. <startDate> - d. <endDate>, <end> at age <length>",
            "pagePast": "<end> <endDate>"


[11/16/2023 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, okay, that makes sense


[11/16/2023 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
Ok I pushedthat


[11/16/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
I did test but not a ton


[11/16/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
let me know if you see issues


[11/16/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
The header for events generates the dataviewjs block but it doesn't evaulate correctly outside of a header block


[11/16/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
looking at fixing that


[11/16/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
i probably won't look at much tonight, i'm still working on region pages


[11/16/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but will test a bit tomorrow or over the weekend


[11/16/2023 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
need to send out session notes over the weekend so will need to work a bit on export


[11/16/2023 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
hopefully the export is pretty straightforward at this point


[11/16/2023 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
given the JS -> ChatGPT -> python pipeline


[11/16/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/16/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
one last thought


[11/16/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
conceptually, species and ancestry are just typeOf relationships


[11/16/2023 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
that is true


[11/16/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so fundamentally, every page can conceptually have the following metadata:
startDate
endDate
typeOf
whereabouts


[11/16/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
partOf


[11/16/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
subType


[11/16/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
affiliation


[11/16/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
conceptually and for readablity, we alias speces == typeOf and ancestry == subType


[11/16/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
born == startDate


[11/16/2023 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
DR = startDate


[11/16/2023 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
etc


[11/16/2023 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
placeType is also just typeOf


[11/16/2023 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
actually I like that, you can do a dataview query for typeOf: inn


[11/16/2023 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/16/2023 9:50 PM] .deciusmus
orgType is also just typeOf


[11/16/2023 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/16/2023 9:50 PM] .deciusmus
I actually don't think subType is a thing, it is just people have 2 "typeOf" values


[11/16/2023 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[11/16/2023 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but it matters for display which is primary vs secondary


[11/16/2023 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/16/2023 9:52 PM] .deciusmus
there are a few other special cases:
* reignStart, reignEnd, leaderOf for people
* rarity for items


[11/16/2023 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
magical/mundane for items as well


[11/16/2023 9:52 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/16/2023 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
I'm trying to get the whereabouts -> partOf -> whereabouts to work right now


[11/16/2023 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but basically the only special cases you have then are a few item additions and a few leader additions


[11/16/2023 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
plus things like ka


[11/16/2023 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/16/2023 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think I would lean towards leaving born, died, species, ancestry in the frontmatter as aliases


[11/16/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, agreed


[11/16/2023 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
but replace created/destroyed with the generic startDate/endDate


[11/16/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
why?


[11/16/2023 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess no reason


[11/16/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
or do you think we should replace DR with startDate / endDate


[11/16/2023 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
no I like DR


[11/16/2023 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
we need to keep DR for readability on list tags


[11/16/2023 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
I think created / destroyed / DR / DR_end / born / died


[11/16/2023 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
is fine


[11/16/2023 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, okay, agreed


[11/16/2023 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, this sounds great and will dramatically simplify stuff. i am stopping for the night now but i'll test tomorrow, and also probably finish my region cleanup soon


[11/16/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus

[11/17/2023 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
I am moving all of the string construction out of Javascript into format strings


[11/17/2023 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
So i.e.      whereaboutsLastKnown: "Last known location: (as of <endDate>): <loc>",


[11/17/2023 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
The "loc" token is special:

<loc:int>

Will generate int depth.

i.e.

<loc:1> means just the target, don't follow the chain

<loc:10> means go up to 10 levels in partOf chain


[11/17/2023 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
my javascript -> python gpt works by function (if you give it too much code it tends to trail off) so it is pretty easy to just update individual functions


[11/17/2023 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
the only complicated bit is if you refactor entire classes


[11/17/2023 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
or change how functions are called so all function calls need to be updated


[11/17/2023 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
loc also supports t, i.e. 

<loc:5t> means depth 5 / use title case


[11/17/2023 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
that is great


[11/17/2023 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
The format strings follow a path of:

displayDefaults: x is prefered over metadata.json's setting for the type is preferred over metadata.json's setting for default is preferred over the hardcoded default


[11/17/2023 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
to avoid having to deal with missing strings or other similar null-ref errors I hard code a base default for each string in name manager

Need to think about subType typeOf vs typeOf (subType)


[11/17/2023 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
the reason to do subtype typeof is because I share code


[11/17/2023 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
it's just

get all the type of parts in order
merge


[11/17/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
ah. hmm


[11/17/2023 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but then there is no way to prevent e.g. archfey fey of Amberglow


[11/17/2023 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
or great wyrm dragon


[11/17/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
yeah Agata as hag fey is not the nicest


[11/17/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
but I didn't have a better idea


[11/17/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
I guess fey (hag) or fey (archfey) looks nicer


[11/17/2023 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
but for humans I like Tyrwinghan human


[11/17/2023 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
or Tyrwinghan elf


[11/17/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe we should have a subSpecies and I can special case that like

Tollender great wrym (dragon)


[11/17/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
(i.e. the "species" element is:

if (species && subspecies) species (subspecies)
else species ?? subspeices


[11/17/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is probably not correct to completely generalize any type-specific formatting


[11/17/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
that is, I don't think it makes sense to just smash up all vaguly typeOf/partOf like information into a generic string


[11/17/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
we are heading out to dinner. I did push a spec


[11/17/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I would have: typeOf (alias = species) and subType (alias ancestry, rarity)


[11/17/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Then just use your format string


[11/17/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
Gender is a special case that can be inserted if desired and present


[11/17/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I’ll look at the spec


[11/17/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
(Spec not complete, fyi)


[11/17/2023 7:32 PM] rsulfuratus
here is what I would propose. i think it is really nice to actually have a type-specific string you can control, because without that some things are inevitably going to look ugly. e.g. right now if you put a ddbLink for a PC for a character sheet it is a mess (or, say, to the homebrew mechanics for a species on a species page). 

I can't think of a situation where you would want more than three basic pieces: a mainType, a subType, and a descriptor. 

Then, there are a small number of "special" pieces:
primaryAffiliations
ddbLink
ka if you are an elf, and potentially other things like this

So I would use a format string with some sensible aliases.
`mainType = species || typeOf ` (potentially adding a default "item" if type is item and any of ddbLink,rarity,magical/mundane exist
`subType = ancestry || rarity`
`descriptor = gender || magical/mundane`

then the string is:
<subType> <descriptor> <mainType> for items
<mainType> (<subType>) for people
etc

requires a bit of fiddling to get the () to not show up in there is no subType. for specific people you could add gender to the line, if you wanted, with the usual override.


[11/17/2023 7:32 PM] rsulfuratus
for events and defaults probably just <mainType> (generally subType and descriptor wouldn't be defined anyway)


[11/17/2023 7:34 PM] rsulfuratus
then you add:
- if ddbLink, something like [<linkText>](ddbLink) where <linkText> is mechanics by default and overwrites to character sheet for people (but this can theoretically then be used for ANY link, doesn't technically need to be dndbeyond
- primaryAffiliations as current
- ka as current

species (ancestry), pronous

looks way better than the current layout IMO


[11/17/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
I think this is close but not quite there yet.

For example, I think that

sea elf
fire giant
storm giant
cursed giant

all seem better than

elf (sea)
giant (fire)
giant (storm)
giant (cursed)

Same with
Semabaran human (compared to human (Sembaran))

admittedly a bit of a personal preference


[11/17/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
there are cases where it looks bad:

archfey fey
great wrym dragon
oni giant


[11/17/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
but actually in those three cases, I think archfey | great wrym | oni are effectively aliases for the type


[11/17/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't have very strong feelings about the default
species (ancestry) or ancestry species
although I lean towards the former


[11/17/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe for display purposes, but very strong disagree for actual tagging


[11/17/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
right, I don't mean species: archfey


[11/17/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
I mean what you are trying to say is that this is a "fey" with no other info, but you want it to display as

archfey

not 
fey


[11/17/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
but dataview query for table name where species = fey should still find it


[11/17/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
sure in those cases you could have a display string that is just "<subtype> <descriptor>" or whatever


[11/17/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think in those cases you'd prefer the header to be


[[fey|archfey]]


[11/17/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
i.e it is literally a display alias to the link


[11/17/2023 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[11/17/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
personally I think that it was basically fine before


[11/17/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean i get it is fun to play with this and optimize things, and having the partOf stuff and item whereabouts is great


[11/17/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, I could just restore the old code


[11/17/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
It is true it wasn't really an issue


[11/17/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
I got a bit caught up in the "lets get rid of the concept of a 'page type'"


[11/17/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
So there is a purist perspective that says the header generator shouldn't care about page type


[11/17/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
part of the problem is this is consuming all my d&d time and i've got two sessions to run next week and two sets of session notes to send out plus worldbuilding stuff i want to work on


[11/17/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
Heh


[11/17/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it would make sense to fiddle around with this on a branch


[11/17/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
Well, from my perspective this is useful from a learning Javascript perspective


[11/17/2023 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. my actual goal is to get a bit more familar with Javascript and this is a convienent project


[11/17/2023 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that's great, but i guess for me while i enjoy the coding aspects of this and it is nice learning about spec writing and stuff, it is actually more important to me for the content


[11/17/2023 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I get that


[11/17/2023 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
and the type line is not that interesting


[11/17/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps simplest to just restore the special casing we had before and move on


[11/17/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
realistically, the type line is actually only interesting if the page either has

one of species or ancestry
or typeOf but not partOf


[11/17/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
if it has none of those, a type line is silly


[11/17/2023 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. because saying typeOf: battle

and then having the header by

battle
a battle in the Great War

is not ideal


[11/17/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/17/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
places & events only care about typeOf for queries and for partOf lines


[11/17/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
people & items get a special type line that is custom based on the old layout, but with the primarily affliation tweaks


[11/17/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I like the primary affiliation stuff, that has a lot of advantages, although it was obviously built with your complicated royals in mind 🙂


[11/17/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
Well, the affiliation stuff was not really built with anything in mind


[11/17/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
The leaderOf (which I don't know if you have looked at) was built for Sembaran royalty


[11/17/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes,that is what I meant, the Ruler of X and Y and Z


[11/17/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/17/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess that isn't affiliations, that is a separate thing


[11/17/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/17/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway


[11/17/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
affiliations is just to make it easy to do clans or whatever


[11/17/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
if we want


[11/17/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
Ok, so my plan then is to:

a) restore the old typeOf stuff
b) do further non-bug fix messing around on a branch


[11/17/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
well, also nice for dwarves instead of a specific thuhr, e.g you could have [ clan thuhr ] and the "of the Gemcrafters and the Warrior thuhr"

{Reactions}
👍

[11/17/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/17/2023 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
my hope is to get a draft of the python stuff done tonight, and then focus on session notes and session prep over the weekend, even if the python code is not fully working (in a pinch can just convert session notes only and just add it to existing taelgarverse)


[11/17/2023 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
(you should also take a break from coding to look at bastion stuff!)


[11/17/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
Yes, bastion is on my list


[11/17/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
To look at as well as your PR about regions


[11/17/2023 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
regions are done except dunmar and green sea - spent a while on sentinels and Chardonian Empire


[11/17/2023 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm taking next week off, so planning to debug website build during that time, and also do a lot of note cleanup


[11/17/2023 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
if you are at your computer, is there an obvious reference for the obsidian api somewhere? i need to know what these are supposed to return:
window.app.vault.getRoot()
window.app.metadataCache.getFirstLinkpathDest(target, root)
window.app.metadataCache.getFileCache(tfile)
window.app.vault.getMarkdownFiles()


[11/17/2023 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
getRoot().path is presumably returning path to the vault
window.app.vault.getMarkdownFiles() presumably a list of all markdown files in the vault


[11/17/2023 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
those I have


[11/17/2023 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
this one is the least clear: window.app.metadataCache.getFirstLinkpathDest


[11/17/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
window.app.metadataCache.getFileCache(tfile)?.frontmatter presumably returns the metadata for tfile if it exists, that isn't too hard i'm sure there is a python package that reads markdown and parses yaml


[11/17/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
getRootPath you don’t need. I just use it as a value to pass to getFirstLinkpathDest


[11/17/2023 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
All of that logic is basically boils down to:
Given a string like “Cece I” find the frontmatter for the file


[11/17/2023 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
So either just find the first file named Cece I.md or use obsidian tools


[11/18/2023 7:41 AM] rsulfuratus
code updates:
- python export is sort of working; there is a bug in my partOf code I haven't found yet, a date formatting issue unique to Python, and a few whereabouts formatting display issues I fixed in javascript that I haven't ported, but it is good enough for session notes and I might have time to fix the last few bugs today
- I partially reverted the header generation, moving the old code (with generic typeOf lines) to generateHeader_develop.js, where you can branch if you'd like to noodle on this. I didn't want to just revert the code because there are some format string and other updates intermingled. i kept the move to generic typeOf and whereabouts, e.g. I didn't revert to the placeType and basedIn for places and orgs, these still use whereabouts
- get_RegnalDates is not working in either javascript or python; if you get the javascript working I can try to fix the python, but this is not a high priority for me. i think it has to do with incompatible metadata (at least that seems to be the problem with the translated python), but I'm not likely to spend the time tracking this down
- in addition to get_RegnalDates not working, there is something a little buggy with orgs, where organizations without orgType always default to being a primaryOrg and showing up with the "of XXX" line instead of in the "Member of: " line. I just gave a bunch of things types instead of tracking this down, but would be worth fixing


[11/18/2023 7:44 AM] rsulfuratus
other small things:
- I changed default "Ruler of XXX" to "Leader of XXX", since it is usually used w/o title for leaders of organizations; I assume there is a way to change this with displayDefaults for pages that one cares about, but it doesn't seem to be documented and I didn't want to dig around in the code
- there are a few other small things that could be perhaps cleaned up about leaders and orgs which remain in a bit of an in-between state right now


[11/18/2023 7:47 AM] rsulfuratus
my plan:
- except for python debugging if I feel like it, and maybe a few small header tweaks as I work on content if I see easy to fix bugs, I'm not working on code until Monday
- i'm going to regenerate a lot of headers with the current (type-specific) header code as part of session notes and general content cleanup
- my preference would be to keep bugfixes and other stability improvements to the current code in main, and to branch any messing about with summary line generalization.


[11/18/2023 8:56 AM] .deciusmus
This all sounds good


[11/18/2023 9:00 AM] .deciusmus
I was thinking some more about person type categorization and I still think we are missing something. You would, for example, never want to do a data view query for “fire” I don’t think to get fire giants and fire elements (but not efreti)


[11/18/2023 9:01 AM] .deciusmus
In other words the human ancestry piece tends to be useful especially as a shorthand for a more complex origin query to get groups as people


[11/18/2023 9:01 AM] .deciusmus
Nonhuman ancestry is mostly used as a more specific description of a anything


[11/18/2023 9:03 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, I agree. conceptually probably the correct way to do it would be to treat that as typeOf, e.g. a fire elemental is a typeOf elemental, and you look up typeOf for the species and get [[ elemental|fire elemental]]


[11/18/2023 9:03 AM] rsulfuratus
but that makes dataview queries to get all elementals annoying complex


[11/18/2023 9:03 AM] rsulfuratus
and also means you need pages for every subspecies, basically


[11/18/2023 9:04 AM] rsulfuratus
ancestry, on the other hand, is really a distinct subType. you could for example be a Sembaran dwarf


[11/18/2023 9:05 AM] .deciusmus
I think the right answer is to have a “typeOfAlias” in the front matter


[11/18/2023 9:05 AM] rsulfuratus
well, except that I also like the ability to query all hags, for example


[11/18/2023 9:05 AM] rsulfuratus
(although at the moment I only have two invented)


[11/18/2023 9:06 AM] rsulfuratus
I think for people you really need three things:
1. subType
2. ancestry
3. species


[11/18/2023 9:07 AM] rsulfuratus
default display is [[species|subType]] (ancestry) or something


[11/18/2023 9:07 AM] .deciusmus
Right so the subtype is fire giant not fire


[11/18/2023 9:07 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/18/2023 9:07 AM] rsulfuratus
but that makes sense too because it simplies queries


[11/18/2023 9:07 AM] .deciusmus
For a hag would you want to point to the hag page or the fey page


[11/18/2023 9:08 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure, but that could be override with page-specific displayDefaults


[11/18/2023 9:08 AM] rsulfuratus
for a hag you might want: species (subType)


[11/18/2023 9:09 AM] .deciusmus
I was thinking you wouldn’t see the word “fey” on line at all


[11/18/2023 9:09 AM] .deciusmus
That’s consistent with some fey like dryad where the species is (currently) just dryad


[11/18/2023 9:09 AM] rsulfuratus
if you wanted that, you could do [[subType]]


[11/18/2023 9:10 AM] rsulfuratus
I think it should be controllable by frontmatter. e.g. now that I've thought more about species in Taelgar I might want to go retag things


[11/18/2023 9:10 AM] rsulfuratus
and maybe for archfey and centaurs you don't want to display fey, but for faires and satyrs you do


[11/18/2023 9:10 AM] rsulfuratus
i haven't thought about it much


[11/18/2023 9:12 AM] rsulfuratus
if you were doing this totally specific for people pages, I'd do:
species - your species
subspecies - a descriptor for the specific kind of your species you are, e.g. hag, fire elemental, great wyrm
ancestry - a shorthand for origin culture


[11/18/2023 9:12 AM] .deciusmus
So my proposal would be:

subtype??species (ancestry) as the default, both linked to whatever page the link finder finds 

(Including using the json link map)


[11/18/2023 9:13 AM] rsulfuratus
yes I think that is a good default


[11/18/2023 9:13 AM] .deciusmus
So we could add say a archfey -> fey link map or a great wrym->dragon etc


[11/18/2023 9:14 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/18/2023 9:18 AM] rsulfuratus
so I think then if you wanted to try to generalize to a less type specific type line, you'd really want to think about four kinds of pieces:

- there is a "primary" type, this is species in people, typeOf for everything else, and is "this is a specific <X> of <primary type>"
- there is a "subtype", this is subspecies in people, subType for everything else, and is "this is a specific <X> of <subtype> which is a kind of <primary type>"
- there is an "alternate type", this is ancestry in people and e.g. rarity in magic items, which is distinct from subtype in that any combination of alt type and primary type is in principle valid (e.g., you can be a Sembaran dwarf or a Sembaran human or even a Sembaran fire elemental, but you can't be a fire elemental dwarf)
- there is a "descriptor", this is gender/pronouns in people and magical/mundae in items, this is to represent an additional descriptor that is commonly used


[11/18/2023 9:20 AM] rsulfuratus
technically, you could make this completely general if you followed typeOf chains and did a lot of processing/default setting to a) make sure that every subtype has a typeOf defined, and b) set up some display overrides to handle outputting


[11/18/2023 9:20 AM] rsulfuratus
but that feels like it would make data entry and queries really annoying


[11/18/2023 9:22 AM] rsulfuratus
so what I'd propose if you want to generalize things is to construct a type line string format from: secondary type (ancestry in people, rarity in items, secondType in everything else); primary type (species in people, typeOf in everything else); sub type (subspecies in people, subType in everyone else); descriptor (pronouns in people, magical/mundane in items)


[11/18/2023 9:22 AM] .deciusmus
No I would do it by having specific frontmatter
- species
- subspecies
Etc


[11/18/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
the key change is splitting subspecies and ancestry as conceptually different and with different display priorities and search goals


[11/18/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
this reminds me, where did we end up on item uniqueness?


[11/18/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess just rarity at this point


[11/18/2023 9:26 AM] rsulfuratus
typeOf is too useful for other stuff to use undefined typeOf to mean unique


[11/18/2023 9:26 AM] .deciusmus
I was going to be a little less generic.  My plan was to have a type line string that takes format options of:
- a set of specific metadata (pronoun, rarity, etc)
- some calculated values like mainType 
- and then have unique cases handled via display default override


[11/18/2023 9:26 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense


[11/18/2023 9:27 AM] .deciusmus
I also think for unknown types the type line can be blank. You really only want it for people and items mostly


[11/18/2023 9:27 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/18/2023 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
So the default item line would be something like:
(rarity subtype type)
And the default subtype is magical 

For people it’s 
Ancestry calculated primary type, pronouns


[11/18/2023 9:31 AM] .deciusmus
So you can if you want more descriptive item text do something like

Magical mithril as the subtype (or just mithril at which point it would link to the page on mithril if it existed)


[11/18/2023 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
If you want Agata to say hag (fey) instead of just hag you set her display override to

subspecies (species)


[11/18/2023 9:32 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense


[11/18/2023 9:33 AM] rsulfuratus
items of materials is an interesting case - not sure it is worth generalizing to, but that is basicaly "ancestry" for items


[11/18/2023 9:33 AM] rsulfuratus
of course so is rarity


[11/18/2023 9:34 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah I wasn’t thinking it was worth generalizing. And also for some items you might want to see
(rare Chardonian magic ring)


[11/18/2023 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/18/2023 9:35 AM] .deciusmus
But I don’t think you would ever be searching for all Chardonian magic rings per se. It’s more some nice flavor


[11/18/2023 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
agreed, but you still want the ring to have magical = true


[11/18/2023 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
I don't think I want to get rid of the true/false flag for magical


[11/18/2023 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
so you probably need another frontmatter item if you want a subtype for items


[11/18/2023 9:36 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/18/2023 9:36 AM] .deciusmus
Although maybe magical is just a tag


[11/18/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
ah hmm yeah that is probably best


[11/18/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
well, wait


[11/18/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
But I think in general the goal of magical is get lists of magic items.  But a tag is best for that


[11/18/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
we'd need to do a lot of tag cleaning, because the downside is that you can't set the default to magical if magical doesn't exist in tags, since then you can't ever have a mundane item


[11/18/2023 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
You just set the subType to mundane


[11/18/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
ah, okay, yeah that works


[11/18/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
anyone these small details are better to fiddle with once someone actually starts generating headers for a lot of items because in the abstract it is a bit hard to know exactly what will look nice and feel useful

{Reactions}
👍

[11/18/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
the general concept seems sensible


[11/18/2023 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
and for people where we do have a lot of headers, the separation of subspecies and ancestry is a nice improvement


[11/18/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
Alternatively you could grab the default subtype from the second part of the item tag

Item/book becomes book
Item/magical becomes magical
Etc


[11/18/2023 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
Anyway we are about to have breakfast but I wil play around a bit later and also try to fix regnal@studd


[11/18/2023 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
here is a random feature request from updating notes. it would be nice to have a "alternate name" option.

Vindristjarna,the Star on the Wind
Rostaurë, the Forest of Rains
Estemar, the City of Peace
Mantle of Protection, aka the Cloak of Rainbows

I don't think you want it in the h1 line
I think you want:

```markdown
# Vindristjarna
**The Star on the Wind**
*(Vind-rist-YAR-na or vin-dree-SHAR-na)*
```


[11/18/2023 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
I was wondering about parsing aliases


[11/18/2023 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe any alias that doesn't contain the name


[11/18/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm. sometimes you want the alias just for linking though, and sometimes denomyns dont contain the name


[11/18/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. Voslander =/= Vostok


[11/18/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
Dwarven =/= Dwarf

[11/18/2023 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
(but I think it looks good)


[11/18/2023 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
Let me get back to that in a sec. A few things:

Version management. 
I am going to keep 3 versions of the header script: old, current, next.
If there is no ongoing changes, the old and next will just call current, but if there is active changes it gives some protection.
If you set the frontmatter version to "old" or "next" it will run the new or old script

So basically, if I am making a major change, it can start as "next" and will only run on pages (for testing) with version: next
once we are happy with it, we can switch it to the "current" and it will run on all pages with version: next or no version, but if it messes something up on a page you can still go back to previous with version: old


[11/18/2023 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
👍


[11/18/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
Secondary Line (i.e. the "type of" stuff).

I think I have something pretty good. There is a "secondaryInfo" display default.

For people, it defaults to: <ancestry> <mainType>, <pronouns>
For items: (<rarity> <ancestry> <subtypeof> <typeof>)
For everything else: nothing

The following frontmatter keys work: gender, typeOf, species, subspecies, rarity, ancestry
There are 3 calculated values: 
pronouns (as it always has been)
subType   = subTypeOf or calculated from tags
mainType = subspecies or species or typeOf or subtype

To calculate subtype from tags, we
(a) if there is item/x or place/x tag, it is x
(b) if there is an item tag it is the word item
(c) if there is a place tag it is the word place


[11/18/2023 11:16 AM] rsulfuratus
the item whereabouts is fun:

[11/18/2023 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
how did you get the traveling to? is that just a location


[11/18/2023 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
aha, that is the wherabouts of Vindristrjarna


[11/18/2023 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
Vindristjarna's current location


[11/18/2023 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
added traveling to the don't auto-link


[11/18/2023 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
it doesn't link though, presumably because you used "traveling to"


[11/18/2023 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/18/2023 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
there isn't really another way to do it


[11/18/2023 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
I should really add a "descriptor" to whereabouts


[11/18/2023 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
so you can do
{ type: away, descriptor: travelling to, location: <x> }


[11/18/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
ah that would be nice


[11/18/2023 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
maybe overkill but it would make that autolink


[11/18/2023 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
alternatively, I could just split on space and link


[11/18/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure how valuable it is to have it autolink honestly


[11/18/2023 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
the second might be better because you don't want the current location to appear as "Xurkhaz"


[11/18/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
but for maximum flexibility it would be nice to have descriptor actually


[11/18/2023 11:19 AM] rsulfuratus
because then you can do: current location: imprisoned in <link to place>


[11/18/2023 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
actually it is probably better to do it by split on space and check each part


[11/18/2023 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
because otherwise you have to always make sure that "location" is "descriptor + location" or you get weird things


[11/18/2023 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus
ah hmm except that messes up two word locations


[11/18/2023 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus
there is probably a solution but doesn't seem that critical to solve immediately just to autolink, it is cool to have it show up


[11/18/2023 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus
ah except antonia gets a bit weird;

[11/18/2023 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus
since the current location of Vindristjarna is "the Dunmar Fellowship" to generate the owner line


[11/18/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
since on Dec 8th, Vindristjarna was just "home" there is no whereabouts line


[11/18/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
for that date specifically


[11/18/2023 11:27 AM] rsulfuratus
it is a bit excessive but if you set all the whereabouts properly it works perfectly:

[11/18/2023 11:27 AM] rsulfuratus
pretty cool


[11/18/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
I think for something like Vindrisjarna it makes sense to set the actual whereabouts lines


[11/18/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
Eventually, if you do that with each session onte update, we can draw on the map a gps track


[11/18/2023 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/18/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
which is potentially kinda excessive but also kinda cool


[11/18/2023 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
Ok I am pushing an update


[11/18/2023 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
I have "current" set to what was generate_develop, so with the new type stuff discussed here


[11/18/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
Currenty the default type line for people is <ancestry> <mainType> so you will get Chardonian human instead of human (Chardonian) but if you really don't like that you can change the metadata.json 😄


[11/18/2023 11:35 AM] .deciusmus
If you want to have a page use the "old" i.e what you currently have version, just set version: old


[11/18/2023 11:40 AM] .deciusmus
That is pushed


[11/18/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
type line is gone from items in current it looks like? not sure what is wrong


[11/18/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
just doesn't generate type line at all with version: current


[11/18/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
did you change startup script?


[11/18/2023 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
It works for me


[11/18/2023 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
Did you reload metadata?


[11/18/2023 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/18/2023 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus

[11/18/2023 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
weird


[11/18/2023 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
which item


[11/18/2023 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
person wit all


[11/18/2023 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
version: old works fine


[11/18/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
huh


[11/18/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
it worked until I reloaded obsidian and now it doesn't


[11/18/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
it works fine on most npcs so it must somethign specific to that "full" header


[11/18/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
after reload normal stuff is working okay


[11/18/2023 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
the item line is very buggy, what do I set to display:
(very rare magical mirror)


[11/18/2023 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
rarity: very rare
subTypeOf: magical (or make the tag item/magical)
typeOf: mirror


[11/18/2023 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[11/18/2023 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
there is an extra space bewteen rarity and magical


[11/18/2023 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
hrm, I don't see that


[11/18/2023 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
it's affiliations, if I delete affiliations from PersonWithAll it looks fine


[11/18/2023 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I fixed the affiliations bug


[11/18/2023 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
just pushed


[11/18/2023 12:02 PM] .deciusmus
can you paste the full frontmatter that geerates an extra space?


[11/18/2023 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm, can't see it now. maybe it was just a glitch


[11/18/2023 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
if typeOf exists there shouldn't be a default "item"


[11/18/2023 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
(very rare item mirror) -> (very rare mirror)


[11/18/2023 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
yeah there a few bugs in default calc, about to push them


[11/18/2023 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
Pushing a slight fix so that:

default typeOf is "place" or "item" if there is a place-based or item-based tag

default subTypeOf is the 2nd element in a tag that starts place or item


[11/18/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
there is an extra space, obsidian just deletes it
```markdown

typeOf: mirror

[11/18/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
between legendary and magical


[11/18/2023 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
if you go to reading view it is gone


[11/18/2023 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
So:

tag: item
typeOf: mirror
rarity: rare

will generate (rare mirror)

tag: item/magical
typeOf: mirror
rarity: rare

will generate (rare magical mirror)

tag: item/magical
rarity: rare

will generate (rare magical item)


[11/18/2023 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, perfect


[11/18/2023 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
the extra space is after the rarity


[11/18/2023 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
`(legendary  magical mirror)` with rarity
`(magical mirror)` without


[11/18/2023 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
yeah my code to trim interior spaces was wrong


[11/18/2023 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
pushing a fix


[11/18/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
pushed


[11/18/2023 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
partOf also uses the tag-based defaults

if you have a place with a partOf and no typeOf, it will generate based on tags, i.e.

tag: place

a place in 

tag: place/building

a building in

etc


[11/18/2023 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
fixes pushed


[11/18/2023 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
I'm adding accurate whereabouts for Agata


[11/18/2023 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
whereabouts:
- {type: home, end: 1400, location: Amberglow} # end is arbitrary, just needs to exist to prevent Amberglow from being home after she left Garamjala
- {type: home, start: '', end: 1748-05-29, location: Garamjala Desert}
- {type: away, start: 1748-05-29, end: 1748-11-15, location: Ring of the Warded Mind }
- {type: away, start: 1748-11-15, end: 2000-01-01, location: Heartwood Grove } # end is abritrary

[11/18/2023 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
Is there a canonical date when Hralgar was trapped?


[11/18/2023 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
only roughly. he was free during the reign of Akaston, and Eudomes both a) trapped him and b) was alive and had to flee during the first plague


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
so that would be roughly 1010-1020 probably?


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
need to double-check Akaston reign end


[11/18/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
the notes say Apolloyon


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
When the Golden Age ended in civil war, and the [[Omnis Pura]] came to power, things became more difficult, and some time later he was trapped by Eudomes, during Apollyon's reign.


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
is that wrong, should I fix to Akaston


[11/18/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that's right. i mean Hralgar told you that the emperor he remembered was Akaston, this was the time period he was imaging in the dreamworld in his pre-trapped state


[11/18/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
Apollyon's reign was long so trapped during his reign would make sense


[11/18/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
Is Stormcaller Tower part of: Eastern Dunmar or Dunmar


[11/18/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
And if is it partOf Eastern Dunmar, is eastern Dunmar in turn part of Dunmar?


[11/18/2023 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Eastern Dunmar, and yes, for now


[11/18/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus

[11/18/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus

[11/18/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
The lack of a descriptor for whereabouts is a little annoying


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
you could just override whereaboutsCurrent


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
ah although that would mess things up for you


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
in 1720


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
why not just trapped, Stormcaller Tower, Eastern Dunmar?


[11/18/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
that should link probably even though it doesn't do partOf chains


[11/18/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/18/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
actually, you could proably simply a lot going forward with the following:
split loc on comma
if one part, follow partOf chain
if 2 part, link first part only if actual file, follow partof chain
if 3+ part, link first only if actual file, don't follow partof chain


[11/18/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
although that is kind of awkward for traveling to, Place because you have an extraneous comma, but whatever


[11/18/2023 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
probably the right thing to do would be:

if there are no commas in the string, find the first capital letter and use everything after that as the location for linking/part of chains


[11/18/2023 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
so trapped in Stormcaller Tower would be all you had to say


[11/18/2023 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would probably almost always work


[11/18/2023 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a bunch of little bugs with the web export I need to fix


[11/18/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
is "Red Mesa" or "Shakun's Wellspring" the right place for Sameki and Agata's death


[11/18/2023 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
Shakun's Wellspring, which is partOf Red Mesa


[11/18/2023 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i am also working on note clean up now, so would be very helpful to push regularly to avoid too complicated merge conflicts


[11/18/2023 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
will do


[11/18/2023 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
I'm starting with all ancestry that is set that isn't "right" and fixing from there

{Reactions}
👍

[11/18/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
is Red Mesa partOf Karawa, Western Dunmar, or Garmaldji


[11/18/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
eastern dunmar


[11/18/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
sorry meant eastern obs


[11/18/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
agata's hut and pava and avaras' house are part of garamjala


[11/18/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
kharsan as well

[11/18/2023 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
garamjala is part of nashtkar


[11/18/2023 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
which I guess it part of the desolation of cha'mutte


[11/18/2023 3:20 PM] .deciusmus

[11/18/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that looks right, assuming you checked session notes/timeline for dates


[11/18/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
5/29/1748 is the date we killed agata and samerki


[11/18/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
per session note


[11/18/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/18/2023 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
actually, samerki was watching cintra the whole time. FEb 08 1748 to death date


[11/18/2023 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
where are we putting destroyed places?


[11/18/2023 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
gazeteer?


[11/18/2023 3:27 PM] .deciusmus
I think a relatively recently destroyed place goes in gazeteer


[11/18/2023 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
if it predates say, the great war, its history, unless the ruins are particularly interesting, I think


[11/18/2023 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
doing Drankor era stuff


[11/18/2023 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
Rostaurë


[11/18/2023 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
I think that's history right?


[11/18/2023 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't really still exist, even as a ruin


[11/18/2023 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
although maybe it does?


[11/18/2023 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
But I think if there is some haunted remains, that would be its own place:

Haunted Remains of Rostaure


[11/18/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
fair enough


[11/18/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
putting it in history for now


[11/18/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
renaming Drankorian Empire to Drankorian Era though


[11/18/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
so history is organized by time possibly region


[11/18/2023 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
for fixing non-humans:

1. Mostly just setting subspeciies, i.e. Hralgar is subspecies : storm giant, species: giant and adding a linkmap for storm giant -> giants
2. For a small set where it seems like the subspecies is independently interesting, I am setting the secondaryInfo line to override as <species> (<subspeices>) so we get both


[11/18/2023 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
For #2 so far oni and hag are my 2 examples


[11/18/2023 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
Although for Samerki, is he is probably oni as species, giant as subspecies, right?


[11/18/2023 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
oni is type of giant


[11/18/2023 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
what do we call the period of history between the fall of Drankor and the Great War?


[11/18/2023 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
for both agata and samerki i'd set species = giant/fey, subspecies = oni/hag, but set the display to be <subspecies> (<species>)


[11/18/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
that's what I did

[11/18/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
hrm


[11/18/2023 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
I also set Taelgar to not auto-link btw


[11/18/2023 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
good


[11/18/2023 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
if you make a page for Taelgar it will link, but didn't want the links showing up without the page


[11/18/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
fyi i've found the metadata comments often get stripped if they are the end of lines, but tend to stay when on their own line


[11/18/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure why, probably some obsidian processing thing


[11/18/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but i've started putting them e.g. after the whereabouts instead of in the list


[11/18/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
do you happen to have a death date for Typhina? I set it to 1400 (to match Agata's "end" date for feywild as home)


[11/18/2023 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
she died in the feywild, so "sunset"?


[11/18/2023 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
time in feywild is tricky


[11/18/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
heh but that won't parse


[11/18/2023 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
it would have been after calaus showed up (since when he showed up CLoudspinner was still around)


[11/18/2023 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
I would be kinda nice to have the ability to just say died: true


[11/18/2023 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
probably something like 1200 - 1300 would be reasonable


[11/18/2023 3:40 PM] .deciusmus
or actually to be able to say : true for any end date


[11/18/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/18/2023 3:40 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. to have agata's whereabouts be

{ type: home, location: Feywilded, end: true }


[11/18/2023 3:40 PM] .deciusmus
actually letting end dates by true or false would be useful


[11/18/2023 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
although what does end true really mean?


[11/18/2023 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
end: true means this is in the past for all possible dates


[11/18/2023 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
that will work up until someone decides to run a campaign during the Drankorian era


[11/18/2023 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/18/2023 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
which I've considered


[11/18/2023 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
But, it is easier to find


[11/18/2023 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
can just have convention that end 0001-01-01 is "true"


[11/18/2023 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
that will, in fact, be in the past for all possible dates since you can't have a date before 1/1/1


[11/18/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess unless you set your calendar to 1/1/1


[11/18/2023 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
I mean you could use 0001 and 9999 as "true" and "false" respectively


[11/18/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
yea


[11/18/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but 0001 for end is not technically 0001, it's 0001-12-31 isn't it?


[11/18/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
not that that should matter


[11/18/2023 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
that covers all "realistc" dates until someone decides to run a game during the Downfall Wars and we need to handle CY dates


[11/18/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/18/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
(and end: 0001 is visually more appealing than end: 0001-01-01 )


[11/18/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
I do have a dr -> cy -> dr function working in my python code


[11/18/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
relies on python date objects being able to have bce years though


[11/18/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
otherwise you can't convert cy dates before 4133


[11/18/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
probably the way to do it in java would be to internally just convert everything to "days since time began" as an int, then you could forget about string sorting, and you'd just need a display function to convert to DR / CY


[11/18/2023 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/18/2023 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
this works:

```dataview
table from #person where contains(whereabouts.end, 1400)
```


[11/18/2023 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
so having 0001, 9999 should  be an easy convention for true/false


[11/18/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
actually if you did that you could fairly easily write a function to generate dynastic years and regnal years and ka from days


[11/18/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
would be nice to have a little calculator for date conversion built in, i was looking at actually doing this in python because there is a plugin that lets you do notebook-like operations


[11/18/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
don't think you'd want to support regnal years and that stuff for anything except display of course


[11/18/2023 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/18/2023 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
is timeline descriptor still a thing?


[11/18/2023 3:53 PM] .deciusmus
my get Events table code has been a bit neglected


[11/18/2023 3:53 PM] .deciusmus
I was planning on moving to displayDefaults but havent yet


[11/18/2023 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
ok, I pushed a bugfix where you can now use end: 0001 or died: 0001 and it should display correctly, i.e.

[11/18/2023 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
lich (undead) is another one where it is probably nice to have both


[11/18/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Apollyon does not have an ancestry of lich but I will add subspecies


[11/18/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
the died archiecture doesn't handle undead that well


[11/18/2023 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
well didn't want to put it in there until it was clear in game, there is no good way to have secret metadata


[11/18/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/18/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
if you have a died date will it still generate Current location?


[11/18/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., originally from drankor, killed in drankor, current location unknown?


[11/18/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
you wouldn't want that in general I guess


[11/18/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
it does not


[11/18/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
undead are probably best treated specially


[11/18/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/18/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean custom/manual


[11/18/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
right, that is what I thought you meant


[11/18/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
its easiest to just have a timeline block for died & reborn and let the "died" date in metadata not be set


[11/18/2023 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/18/2023 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
well, eventually maybe it gets sense


[11/18/2023 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
*set


[11/18/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
yes. like for Grash, I am going to set the died date to 1720-01-19


[11/18/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
haha


[11/18/2023 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
Speaking of Grash:

is it subspecies: skeleton or subspecies: blank and ancestry: skeletal or subspecies: blank and secondaryInfo: "skeletal <species>"


[11/18/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
ancestry skeletal


[11/18/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
should generate skeletal undead yes?


[11/18/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/18/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
although it capitalizes


[11/18/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
although I guess we capitalize in the frontmatter so no need, i.e. it is
Dunmari in the frontmatter


[11/18/2023 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
I'll fix the title casing there


[11/18/2023 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
Do we know when Grash left Kharsan?


[11/18/2023 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yes you scried on him


[11/18/2023 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
I found a scry date of ~10-23


[11/18/2023 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
I was setting slightly better whereabouts for Grash


[11/18/2023 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
nov 28


[11/18/2023 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
nov 28 left kharsan


[11/18/2023 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
after that, you should have the war of the cloak page which is up to date to current day


[11/18/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
last scried would have been late dec during the time in tollen

with a note:
# start date of Kharsan is guess, Tim might have a more canonical date


[11/18/2023 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
put 1747. grash had been there at least 9 months according to the orcs you interogatted when you were in kharson in april


[11/18/2023 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
of course that is still a guess


[11/18/2023 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but a more accurate one


[11/18/2023 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
and actually, you could pin it down even more, since obviously he *wasn't* in kharsan when the werewolf leader found the scepter


[11/18/2023 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
which is a date you got from interogatting the werewolf prisoner in tokra


[11/18/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but I don't need to be that accurate


[11/18/2023 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
put 1747, the exact date in that year is uncertain but it is definitely then


[11/18/2023 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
1747 (Fraternity of the Empty Moon): A werewolf who is part of the Fraternity of the Empty Moon finds the Scepter of Command near Kharsan

is People of the Rainbow a clan? I guess yes, right?

I’m working on orcs though, since you are heading that way

I’ll fix caelynn


[11/18/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Probably nothing too major. The only really important secret not to read is philosophers guild. Most other secret stuff is in my DM notes not the public notes


[11/18/2023 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
I prefer to just not read them


[11/18/2023 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
I was just trying to scan the backlinks in Caelyns file to get the date we met her

and saw it but I didn't read it other than accidentally to see something about how she can't die

If you are fixing her pull first because I updated her header to include when we met her


[11/18/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
is centaur a type of fey?


[11/18/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
ie. should it be centaur (fey)


[11/18/2023 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
No centaurs would be very mad if you called them fey


[11/18/2023 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
although I guess technically they are a type of fey as they were created by archfey. they have their own page though, so better to just do species = centaur

basically if you have a location: bit that 
(a) doesn't match a file
(b) doesn't START with a capital letter
(c) DOES contain a capital letter we treat it like:

[part before capital letter] [part after capital]

[11/18/2023 6:59 PM] .deciusmus
It has some kind of a stack overflow bug in certain circumstances, I think when you have a place that starts with a captial letter but dosn't exist

probably need to use explicit event tag instead of presence of DR

Your generate header changes are not quite right 🙂


[11/19/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
if you do this:
let type = NameManager.getName(metadata.typeOf, "exists", "lower") ?? getDefaultTypeOf(metadata);

it means that "mainType" will never be the subtype


[11/19/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
maybe that's ok because we don't use maintype except for people?


[11/19/2023 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
but subtype can be maintype


[11/19/2023 9:50 AM] rsulfuratus

the real fancy trick would be to propagate the date correctly


[11/19/2023 10:00 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the default for events pagePastWithStart should be: "pagePastWithStart: "<startDate> - <endDate>, lasted <length> years"


[11/19/2023 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus
have manually added that to a few events and think it looks much better than:
"1545-1555, lasted 10 years"
vs
"Happened 1545-1555, ended after 10 years"


[11/19/2023 10:01 AM] rsulfuratus
going to change unless you object

I still want to fix the current whereabouts line to use the whereabouts display from the TARGET rather than source page


[11/19/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. the current location of an item that is in a place should use the place whereabouts rather than the item whereabouts, I think


[11/19/2023 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
But that's a bigger change

There are a few glitches with unknown dates, like it would work better if there was an actual date there


[11/19/2023 10:28 AM] .deciusmus

>the TARGET rather than source page
>i.e. the current location of an item that is in a place should use the >place whereabouts rather than the item whereabouts, I think

that would be quite complicated. i think you always want to control text on the page itself, but need something like located_in_person vs located_in_place vs located_in_thing


[11/19/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g on page X, you want to be able to change the display defaults to have located-in-person locations and located-in-place locations look different


[11/19/2023 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
right, that probably works better

The big next set of javascript I want to write is:
* Alias handling for an also known as in the header
* Better date support: the idea of "approximate" that changes the display text somewhat so you can say "created: ~1000" or something
* Better date support: CY and DR years
* Better whereabouts chain following as discussed above

I'm doing some gazeeter cleanup...

I've been trying to follow a specific pattern of  for buildings, set typeOf generically (inn, temple, etc) and then set ancestry (for "halfling inn") and subTypeOf (for who the temple is for or a more detailed type of inn - tavern, caravanseri, etc)

This should make it easy to query for "all the inns of taelgar" or "all the temples of taelgar"


[11/19/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
For religious buildings I've been setting the partOf to
"A <typeof> of <subtypeof> in <loc>"


[11/19/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
so you get:
>[!info]+ Information
> A temple of [[Shakun]] in [[Karawa]], [[Eastern Dunmar]], [[Dunmar]]


[11/19/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I haven't done much on buildings other than a few inns


[11/19/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but that sounds reasonable


[11/19/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
I've also been trying to use:

village or town or city for various sized settlements
ruin for anything old and ruined
realm for political units / kingdom-things
region for any generic "place"


[11/19/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
Also, do we have a clear place to put things like, the Lord's Council of Cleenseau?


[11/19/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
Should we try to restrict gazeetter to actual physical places and move other things to organizations


[11/19/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
(that is where I was leaning)


[11/19/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i would put groups that are very specific to a place in gazeetter


[11/19/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
but i'm not certain


[11/19/2023 8:58 PM] rsulfuratus
i think there is a lot of value in having the stuff for a specific place in one spot as it is a lot quicker to skim through, and it is easier to send out to players


[11/19/2023 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
in the ideal world I would like to have a bunch of carefully organized folders (people, places, things, groups, species, cosmology), and then have a gazetteer that is organized more like a sourcebook, but is almost exclusively autogenerated by embedding other notes


[11/19/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess initially i'd focus more on tagging than reorganizing directories though


[11/19/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, agreed, I just was moving all the Sembaran army stuff (which I definitely do think belongs outside of Sembara) and I noticed those


[11/19/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
I'm actually of the opinion that with the right tagged and dataview system, it is nicer to have everything floating around and then "overview pages" for important places that show people/places/etc in a place


[11/19/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. a 

Political Organization of Cleenseau
dataview query for type = organization/political, partOf = Cleenseau

is a lot nicer to me than trying to find stuff in the cleenseau folder


[11/19/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. I think my plan would be to focus on content cleanup and adding frontmatter, and then kind of see where things are after having a chance to play around with dataview with fleshed out content


[11/19/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
On a totally different topic I’m trying to plan sorcerer vs warlock. Sorcerer lvl 2 gives me almost nothing useful but lvl 3 is great as it grants metamagic


[11/19/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not sure when the best time to waste a level on sorc 2


[11/19/2023 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
it is a little hard to predict because I'm not entirely sure what you are doing after you kill Grash


[11/19/2023 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
generally except for level 9, which was very short, i've aimed for ~2 story beats / 8 sessions between levels


[11/19/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
probably next level up would be after next rai hand piece (grash session, 1-2 non-combat sessions in Uzguhkar/Orenlas/Tollen, 3 sessions for fragment adventure); then again after you get all 5 before the final showdown in drankor


[11/19/2023 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is hard to predict as it is sometimes difficult to know when you'll get sidetracked


[11/19/2023 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess if it were me i'd just take it now, unless there is a feat you really want, since warlock 12 is kind of boring too


[11/19/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
personally i'd do sorcerer 2 next, sorcerer 3 after, then warlock 12 going into drankor and take metamagic adept to end up with 5 sorcery points + 3 metamagic options


[11/19/2023 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i assume ultimately you want 17 warlock / 3 sorcerer


[11/19/2023 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/19/2023 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
I think sorc 2 / sorc 3 / warlock 12 is probably good. Are you aiming for lvl 15 for Apollyon showdown?


[11/19/2023 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
i am assuming level 15 when you enter drankor, assuming you mostly go straight to getting the three shards of the hand.


[11/19/2023 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
might be 16 instead of 15 for apollyon fight, but very unlikely to be higher


[11/19/2023 9:58 PM] rsulfuratus
btw - definitely think it makes sense that you take the ring of sharp mind, but also don't forget you can use your sorcerer feature (+2d4) on failed concentration checks as well


[11/19/2023 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
Oh that’s a good point. I forget about that all the time


[11/19/2023 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
sharp mind is supposed to be a backup so that you don't feel like you can't wade into melee, but with advantage plus the 2d4 if you fail, 6 uses should last a good long while


[11/19/2023 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
and the 2d4 recharges on short rest


[11/19/2023 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/20/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
what are your status tags again?


[11/20/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
I've been trying to do minor cleanup in various short bits of time between meetings and such


[11/20/2023 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
Also there are few oddities…
Is Illoria an archipelago in the Nevos Sea or a province (colony? realm?) of the Chardonian Empire?


[11/20/2023 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
status tags are rough, but basically: 
- stub = all information in obisidan, but not much to begin with
- uptodate - all information in obsidian, feels roughly complete
- needswork - needs some attention to sort out details
- notes - information scattered elsewhere that needs to get into obsidion
- draft - was working on something and stopped
- refactor - page needs a rethink for some reason


[11/20/2023 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
the distinction between stub/uptodate is a bit blurry


[11/20/2023 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
as it the distinction between needswork/notes


[11/20/2023 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
still refining these


[11/20/2023 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
but generally, stub/uptodate for me means I don't need to check elsewhere or add detail for session prep
notes means I need to check elsewhere for session prep
needswork means I need to collate information either from notes or internally in obsidian
draft/refactor are often reasonably complete but not in the format I want


[11/20/2023 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
re: Illoria it is both the name of the archipelago and the name of the colony


[11/20/2023 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure how to tag that


[11/20/2023 10:24 AM] .deciusmus
so probably there should be 2 pages in Gazetteer?

Illoria (island) and Illoria


[11/20/2023 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, probably


[11/20/2023 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
Illoria is a protectorate of the Chardonian Empire
Illoira (archipelago ) is an archipelago in the Nevos Sea


[11/20/2023 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
On separate topic, I’m debugging python code, I think I fixed most of the “original” bugs and will probably fiddle around with implementing some of the new features at some point, but would be helpful to have a handful of “fancy notes” that I can check against


[11/20/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
I was thinking about that a bit


[11/20/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
I don't like the testing notes because they clutter up dataview queries


[11/20/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
I was thinking of adding a flag to particular complex notes:
testCase: true

or something

to indicate real notes that have complex rules


[11/20/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
and then we could test python/javascript correpondence on those


[11/20/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
but I hadn't gotten very far on that


[11/20/2023 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah i don't like testing notes either


[11/20/2023 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus
that is a good idea


[11/20/2023 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus
testCase tag


[11/20/2023 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus
or frontmatter item


[11/20/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
Some good ones are:

Apollyon
Scepter of Command
Antonia


[11/20/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
Hralgar


[11/20/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
I like tag even better


[11/20/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Any objection to adding a headerVersion: yaml tag that is auto-generated from the header template generator?


[11/20/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
seems like a nice way to track pages that just need header regen if/when we make significant changes to functionality


[11/20/2023 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus
no, that is good


[11/20/2023 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
it will insert at top of frontmatter


[11/20/2023 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
current version is 2023.11.20 will just use dates going forward


[11/20/2023 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
will update anytime the output of the header would change such that you'd want to regen a page that was using an older version


[11/20/2023 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
pushed


[11/20/2023 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus

[11/20/2023 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
do you remember what you changed to get the "Created by:"


[11/20/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
fixed that


[11/20/2023 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
I have the following pages as test cases, and so far all work in Python:
- Antonia (person in object with whereabouts)
- Apollyon (not sure what is complicated here)
- Hralgar (not sure what is complicated here)
- Mantle of Protection (follow location string at creation date, not current date)
- Scepter of Command (use startStatus in whereabouts)


[11/20/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
if you see any other pages that have complicated whereabouts or page dated stuff, let me know


[11/20/2023 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I also have Evelina (dead person location) and Belegor (origin/last known/current unknown), as test cases for general whereabouts handling


[11/20/2023 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed an update with those tagged testcase


[11/20/2023 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the build process is updated, so i'll also push an update with new website build instructions today

{Reactions}
👍

[11/20/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Apollyon is complicated as someone who's origin needs to be found by someone else


[11/20/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. the scepter of command


[11/20/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
The scepter of command's "created by:" having Drankor rather than unknown as the location is the key though


[11/20/2023 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
ah. i was using mantle of protection as my test for that


[11/20/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Apollyon page itself not interesting


[11/20/2023 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
I was giving you that list from memory, just for cases I was fixing bugs in 🙂


[11/20/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
But actually the data is a bit different

Apollyon is currently set up with an *origin* at the create date of the item whereas Cloudspinner has a *home*


[11/20/2023 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
Hralgar is a test case for following "trapped in Stormcaller Tower" to add the Eastern Dunmar, Dunmar bits


[11/20/2023 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay, that might not be working yet then


[11/20/2023 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
because in my timeline his current location is floating on the storm


[11/20/2023 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
also are you doing something to reformat frontmatter? 
I hate this:

obsidian does that randomly


[11/20/2023 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't know why


[11/20/2023 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
do you have properties set to source:

[11/20/2023 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
ah no, i was just looking to see if there was an option


[11/20/2023 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
that is probably the issue


[11/20/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
that is it


[11/20/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
If you have "properties mode" set to visible it reformats when you add a property


[11/20/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
it reformats any time you add a property not in source mode


[11/20/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
right, that's what I meant


[11/20/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
but changing the setting doesn't totally fix the issue because if you add a property in reading view it still messes things up


[11/20/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
But I keep my obisidian  :
* property mode: source
* page mode: live preview


[11/20/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/20/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
I just never use reading mode


[11/20/2023 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
ah. i toggle source and reading, i don't use live preview much


[11/20/2023 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
That is also what strips your # comments


[11/20/2023 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
from yaml


[11/20/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/20/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
that is very annoying, the file properties update to obsidian is generally not great imo


[11/20/2023 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
yes

lots of complaints about it online, actually

Do you have objections to me pushing a change that deletes _Testing and _templates ?


[11/20/2023 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus
no


[11/20/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
btw dataview doesn't work well with git


[11/20/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
if you do a git pull that changes files it doesn't reindex those files


[11/20/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
or at least, not all of them


[11/20/2023 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
if you quit and reopen obsidian its fine in my experience


[11/20/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
yes I was about to say same


[11/20/2023 1:28 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a reorg of _MoC


[11/20/2023 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
to add a number of helper pages that find potentially wrong, etc stuff


[11/20/2023 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
Most revelevant is Needs Double-Checking specifically for pages where I am doing data cleanup but I'm not sure if it is canonical


[11/20/2023 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
The two key folders are:

Data Quaility, which is for finding things to work on, basically
Pages to Review, which  is mostly for reviewing each others changes


[11/20/2023 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I pulled. i'm adding a few things. i have a links to check page with dangling links, unlinked pages, and linked pages in worldbuliding that should be reviewed for inclusion in gazetteer/elsewhere


[11/20/2023 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
making a few small changes:
- exclude worldbuilding from "Missing Tags"
- sort missing partof by backlinks so highly linked incomplete pages show up first
- sort missing tags by folder then backlinks

[11/20/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I assume we should just tag planes as places


[11/20/2023 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/20/2023 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
what is the feywild partOf ? nothing? the multiverse? echo realms?


[11/20/2023 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
echo realms


[11/20/2023 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
added website build instructions. it should work fine on pc paths but lmk if it throws an error


[11/20/2023 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
I will try it out soon,  maybe not today. I'm on a meeting, just only half paying attention and updating tags at the same time 🙂


[11/20/2023 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
any thoughts on tag categorization for religions and gods?


[11/20/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
not developed thoughts. but I do think it would be useful to have a tag for each religion, to pull together all the bits and pieces. probably religion/mosnumena, religion/fivesiblings, etc


[11/20/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
probably deity is fine as a general tag


[11/20/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe deity/high, deity/incorporeal, deity/embodied


[11/20/2023 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
deity and religion seem like good starting spots


[11/20/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
the divine order google doc has a lot of hierchary in it


[11/20/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
I find it pretty easy to work in layers, i.e. set [deity] for now, which I can do easily, and then we can have a "single layer deity"  work page for more categorization

{Reactions}
👍

[11/20/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
I've been doing:

deity, religion/xxx
sometimes setting:
partOf: religion page
affiliations: [ species ]


[11/20/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. I added

affiliations: [orcs] to Thark
and 
partOf: Five Siblings to Bishma


[11/20/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
Thinking a bit more about how to organize ambiguous places, things that are both a physical place and a political unit. Two relevant contexts:
1) whereabouts for Deno’qai. I don’t really like tribe names for location; this should ideally be an actual location 
2) Illoria - the partOf here should in some sense really be a whereabouts type line; associations between physical places and realms/cultures can vary in time


[11/20/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
Not sure I want to do any major reorg anytime soon


[11/20/2023 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
This is a tough one to tag:

on the place one, I agree it is a bit tricky


[11/20/2023 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
Part of divine realm, religion/five siblings


[11/20/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
I added three tags:

species -> used to tag individual pages for species

meta -> for random "about" pages that I wanted to exclude from the tag list, i.e. main.md, various pages that list events from other places, etc

background -> for "worldbuilding" type information that I didn't want to review to see if it should be moved


[11/20/2023 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
what I have left untagged is mostly history:

[11/20/2023 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
or do we want either (a) divine to not be in spiritual (b) heart of mountain to be directly in spiritual realm or (c) the page to have <loc:2>


[11/20/2023 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Divine realms are a subset of spiritual realms


[11/20/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
Not all subsets of spiritual realms have good names but everything that is associated with gods directly should be a divine realm, anything else directly tagged to spiritual realms

[11/20/2023 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
Metaphysically realms of incorporeal and embodied gods are different but it is a bit too fuzzy at the moment to split up the divine realms yet

[11/20/2023 8:03 PM] .deciusmus
Thinking about organization a bit while I was washing dishes....

Ultimately, I think you *could* (but we definitely shouldn't) distinguish between:

* Groups of people - which ultimately form large political units (Sembara, Chardon) and  cultures (Deno'qai, Highlander) and of course there is a mix
* Places in the world that you could go to and that would exist even if all the people vanished

The question really ends up being -- when do we
(a) have a single page that covers the group and the place
(b) have a different page for the group and the place

Secondarily, the question is, what is the tag and partOf relationship chains?

i.e. if there is one page, is it tagged place or organization, and separately, what is part of it?


[11/20/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
Additionally, there is a separate question of how to model more complex relationships --

For example, Western Cymea is
(a) a place that is part of the Cymean Peninusula
(b) a culture that is ruled by Tollen

Or Illoria is separately
(a) a place that is part of the Nevos Sea
(b) a culture that is ruled by Chardon


[11/20/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
A specific Deno'qai tribe isn't really part of the general Deno'qai tribe, though. Nor is the tribe part of something other than perhaps a larger deno'qai organization


[11/20/2023 8:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i think my feeling is that it is a little hard to know in the abstract. mostly, there aren't places that are both well developed as a geography, and well developed as a culture. we pretty much exclusively have one or the other


[11/20/2023 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
I think the answer is actually fairly straightforward in that we already have 3 types of relationships:

(a) a smaller unit of (either in time, space, or organization). This is the partOf of relationship
(b) a more specific kind of a general type. This is the typeOf relationship
(c) a entity that controls another entity. This is the (little used so far) leaderOf relationship


[11/20/2023 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
There are two things the relationships are used for...
(a) header generation
(b) queries

I think I'd model something like Western Cymea as 

* partOf the Cymean Peninsula (which Cymea is also partOf)
* a typeOf of realm
* set the leaderOf on Tollen to say that Tollen is the leader of Western Cymea


[11/20/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
maybe its all too complicated


[11/20/2023 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
my gut reaction is overloading the leaderOf for modeling political relationships is frought


[11/20/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, you could have a simpler ruledBy


[11/20/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
or controlledBy or something


[11/20/2023 8:12 PM] .deciusmus
But I'm not sure why it is fraught, actually


[11/20/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
what I would probably do is overload whereabouts as ruled by


[11/20/2023 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
leaderOf is trying to do something specific, it is trying to make it easy to go from fixed place to variable rulers


[11/20/2023 8:12 PM] .deciusmus
If you have a dataview table that reports all of the people in Tollen, someone in Western Cymea shouldn't show up though


[11/20/2023 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
right, you probably need to call it something other than whereabouts, because it doesn't report location


[11/20/2023 8:13 PM] rsulfuratus
but it could use the same code logic


[11/20/2023 8:13 PM] .deciusmus
hence leaderOf 🙂


[11/20/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
The difference is that whereabouts is a chain - you can only be in one spot at a time - whereabouts leaderOf is a one -> many - you can be the leader of many things at a time


[11/20/2023 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but when you are working on the page for Western Cymea, you don't want to have to go to the Tollen page to edit Western Cymea's political relationships


[11/20/2023 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
that is the other reason leaderOf is not the same as ruledBy


[11/20/2023 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, you might want the inverse of leaderOf, i.e. ruledBy


[11/20/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
There is a simple version were ruledBy is just a link


[11/20/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. ruledBy: Tollen


[11/20/2023 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
ruledBy: Chardon


[11/20/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
and all it does is produce a second line:

A protectorate in the Cymean Peninsula
Ruled by Tollen


[11/20/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
or whatever


[11/20/2023 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, you can just type that line manually as well, which is the simplest


[11/20/2023 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think my feeling is we've made a lot of organizational changes and information restructuring, and my inclination would be to conslidation information first before refactoring things again


[11/20/2023 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
i've been using status/refactor for pages that have correct and up to date informaiton but there is something about them i don't quite like


[11/20/2023 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
if we fill in content and get 10-15 of those, then it makes sense to think about generalization


[11/20/2023 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
This is coming up because I've been going through the "missing partOf" list


[11/20/2023 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/20/2023 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I think for now I'd stick to geographic relationships where possible for partOf


[11/20/2023 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and keep ruled by relationships in the text


[11/20/2023 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think that is basically what I am trying to say as well


[11/20/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
if something is part of something else, it means it is a smaller piece of a larger thing of the same type


[11/20/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
tomorrow I am going to work on moving content from google docs, as there is a lot there that isn't in obsidian (and some in my old onenote docs); I think that will be informative as well as to where the current organization falls apart


[11/20/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
Partly I was thinking about leader of because I want to fix the regnal stuff for Sembara


[11/20/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
and I was wondering how far we might want to try to take it


[11/20/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
but to keep it simple for now...

(1) partOf should always be used for "same-type" relationships and also for "smaller-bigger" relationships.
When something is a political unit (town, country, whatever) and it could have multiple partOf relationships, pick the "more permanent/important one" as long as it meets smaller -> bigger rule
(2) when a smaller group is a *kind* of thing, but the bigger thing is more of a category than a specific thing, prefer typeOf or ancestry to partOf
(3) use whereabouts to denote current location to allow for boundary crossing - as long as the whereabouts is a thing that could be located in the world, makes sense
(4) ruled by and similar relationships are just in the text

Examples:
the Sembaran Army is not part of Sembara - they are not the same type of thing, but it is whereabouts: Sembara
the Ko'zula could be partOf Northern Deno'qai Tribes or they could be typeOf  - it probably doesn't matter a ton
Western Cymea is not part of Tollen (it could be part of the Tollen Empire if it had been conqueored for 5 generations). It could be partOf the Cymean Peninusla or partOf the Western Green Sea
Illoria is similarly not partOf Chardonian Empire, unless in game that is the most defining feature about it. 
Some town in Mawar is part of the Mawar Confederacy which in turn is partOf the Mawakel Peninsula 
A river in Mawakel might just be defined as partof Mawakel because in that case the physical relationship is more important


[11/20/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
I am going to move Deno'qai to organizations, I think, because they really don't fit as places, unless you object


[11/20/2023 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that makes sense. all the forests have names, I just short-handed a lot of things as <tribename> village that should really have proper names to track


[11/20/2023 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
but also I'm not sure they are really organizations


[11/20/2023 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
they are a culture


[11/20/2023 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
you wouldn't put Sembaran Army in ancestry, for example


[11/20/2023 8:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i've written the information about the deno'qai more like halfings / halfling families or dwarves / clans


[11/20/2023 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, fine to move them around for now, folder organization isn't that critical, but i'd expect those pages would move around more


[11/20/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
it is just a quirk of worldbuilding that in the elderwood, the thing that was important and interesting in the game was the biome + the NPCs


[11/20/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so the deno'qai settlement patterns never got invented


[11/20/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway I need to help N so afk for a bit


[11/20/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
Right on Deno'qai, a specific person would have an affiliation: [ Ko'zula ] and an ancestry: Deno'qai (or perhaps northern Deno'qai or southern Deno'qai)
The page for the Ko'zula tribe itself would either have no relational tags (i.e. no partOf) and a typeOf of tribe or a partOf to Deno'qai or a subTypeOf: northern Deno'qai


[11/20/2023 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
so, eventually, I think we need to have culture pages, that are neither places nor organizations. the model for something like the Deno'qai would be like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts

[11/20/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in the end it is totally fine if there is a culture page for Deno'qai but not other human cultures, there are some place pages that have multiple meanings (Sembara is both a realm, a region, and a culture), and some places where there are separate physical and political pages (Mawar vs Mawakel)


[11/20/2023 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I think “culture” pages are fine. In theory that’s what “ancestry” is about so it would even link nicely

[11/21/2023 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
A couple of random topics.

**Highland Kingdoms**
 I've been thinking a bit about the highland kingdoms as I was cleaning up the Sembaran regnal lines. I have some game reasons to want them to be more fleshed out, so probably making up some stuff there is going to be my next project.

I don't think there is much we've defined anywhere about them right?

My immediate goal is to come up with a better name - I think the entire greater Sembaran region needs a name and then the highland kingdoms can be "the <whatever name> highlands" (to distinguish from <whatevername> lowlands, which is Sembara + Tyrwingha + Maseau + Addermarch)


[11/21/2023 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
Etymology is, I think, the ancient mariner word for "land of many rivers"


[11/21/2023 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, the "lowlands" region ends up acquiring some Drankorian-derived name for whatever Drankor called the provinces and the ancient marnier word comes to mean just the highland section (which is the only bit not conqueored by Drankor)


[11/21/2023 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
there isn't much defined about them, perhaps a bit in the old human migrations docs. they are supposed to be the "north/east" culture that is a mix of the northerners and mariners, basically adopt the northerner gods and the mariner language


[11/21/2023 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
language-wise  Sembara is French/English (with French more to the south and especially the old Isingue language) and Tyrwingha is Welsh/Celtic


[11/21/2023 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
but never really been clear if the highland kingdoms are closer culturally/linguistically to tyrwinghan or vostok/skaerhem


[11/21/2023 1:40 PM] .deciusmus
I think probably Vostok


[11/21/2023 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
so that puts them scandanavian/icelandic/finnish/russian, which is a linguistically odd mix but I think captures the kind of weird linguistic currents of that region


[11/21/2023 1:42 PM] .deciusmus
The current kingdom names are more slavic derived (Zovka, Lavnoch) as are the kestavo names (Kamak, Vacla)


[11/21/2023 1:42 PM] .deciusmus
Tyrwingha is actually another odd blank spot that I should probably think about given the centrality of Tyrwinghan fey to the backgrounds of 2 of my PCs


[11/21/2023 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
In my language doc I have the Skaer/Vos language use the Eastros alphabet


[11/21/2023 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I am going to push my language notes to background in notes that has all the real world mappings that I've used

[11/21/2023 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
I think it actually makes sense for the highland kingdoms to be fairly culturally distinct from lowland "greater sembara"


[11/21/2023 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
Tyrwingha + Sembara + Insingue/Maseau/Addermarch have ~1000 years of shared rule under the Drankorians to culturally align


[11/21/2023 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
whereas the highland kingdoms are - at least per the current history - never conqueored

[11/22/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I think we should remove "stub" from pages which are just headers or otherwise very minimal, but where it isn't clear that more information is needed


[11/22/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
I was trying to use stub for things like Embry where obviously just a header is insufficient


[11/22/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
stub is supposed to mean "a header is enough, this is done"


[11/22/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
ah, that isn't how I was using it at all


[11/22/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe it needs a different tag, or no tag?


[11/22/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
the status tags are definitely a work in progress


[11/22/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i like having tags for:
- this is a minor thing and the frontmatter is checked, skip it and move on
- this is an important note but it is up to date with current lore
- this needs work but primarily inventing stuff
- this needs work but primarily digging through notes/emails/texts/comments
- this needs review of various kinds


[11/22/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
but i haven't really settled on a good shorthand


[11/22/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
also want a tag for "i'm not sure about the status of this thing"


[11/22/2023 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
I like having a tag to distinguish between:
* this thing really needs invention before in-game use; something that needs attention vs
* this thing is minor and doesn't really need invention before in-game use, but more details certainly could be added


[11/22/2023 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
maybe that's the same as your 1 and 3


[11/22/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right, the reason i used stub was i was thinking this is something of course you could always add more detail to, but it doesn't need more detail


[11/22/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
That's very much similar to my "minor and doesn't really need invention"


[11/22/2023 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
whereas 3 is "this is an important thing that has some questions about lore/canon"


[11/22/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
Happy to use stub for that


[11/22/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
But I'm not sure that say the Battle of Metium or Mithril is really "needswork"


[11/22/2023 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah my tagging is inconsistent


[11/22/2023 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
battle of metium should really be notes, I have a few details in OneNote i want to transfer over


[11/22/2023 2:07 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/22/2023 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
mithril probably could be stub


[11/22/2023 2:08 PM] rsulfuratus
although my thinking there is do we want to establish the canon that mithril is equivalent to D&D standard (lets you make armor that is light/easy to where under clothes) or is there more to it in Taelgar?


[11/22/2023 2:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so maybe there should be another category for "unsettled questions but not important"


[11/22/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. these are the kinds of things you can easily improvise general, overarching details about during a session


[11/22/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
which, I guess, is basiclly stub


[11/22/2023 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
To me, the most useful types of things to know are:

* does this note represent broadly what is known about this topic or is there information elsewhere, either in notes or someone's head
* does this note represent an important or unimportant topic


[11/22/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
Where, in particular, for me, I want to shy away from making up lots of details about "important" topics on the spot


[11/22/2023 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
So for example mithril is something where:
* the note represents everything that is known and 
* the topic isn't very important


[11/22/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that is a good way to represent it


[11/22/2023 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
for me, i also care about whether the "information elsewhere" is:
- in my head or needs to be invented
- in notes somewhere but not in Obsidian
- in Obisidian in some form but needs some work to incorporate


[11/22/2023 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
Whereas say the note for Valit, a small town near Cleenseau:
* is not very important but
* the note doesn't represent everything that is known


[11/22/2023 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah strongly endorse that as well


[11/22/2023 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
and actually, at some level, I'm not sure I care that much about:

* not very important but there are known details in Tim's head

and

* important but details need to be invented


[11/22/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
they are both indicators that the note is potentially dangerously non-canonical


[11/22/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, a little bit of informality and commonsense helps a lot as well


[11/22/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
and actually maybe what I just said is wrong, in the sense that it matters where the details are


[11/22/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
what i'm trying to say is something like:

status/notes and
status/needswork

could do double duty. Is it important whether something needs work because it is just obviously incomplete or because someone's idly planning needs to be written down?


[11/22/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
I also somewhat prefer not to try to have a "done" or "up to date" label


[11/22/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
To me, a status label indicates there is some action on the note


[11/22/2023 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i'm not sure the uptodate is particularly useful


[11/22/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
there is also no reason there can't be multiple status labels, so we don't have to agree on everything


[11/22/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
right, of course


[11/22/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
it is helpful to agree on a few key things that have specific meaning though


[11/22/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/22/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
I think I'd propose a basic set:

status/needswork 
means that this note does not contain all of the information about this topic and shouldn't be treated as "complete"

status/draft
means that this note is largely complete but could use a second opinion  / review before being considered canonical. Might need agreement before removing draft status

status/check
this note has a comment about consistency accuracy and needs someone to do a check 

status/refactor
this note appears to be "accurate and complete" at first glance, but it represents something that needs rethinking


[11/22/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps also a status/unknown


[11/22/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
for "not sure what the status is"


[11/22/2023 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe also

status/stub for "I just created this page because I was filling in back links or empty spots on the map but I don't know anything about it and its up for grabs"


[11/22/2023 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
i.e.

status/needswork means "important and incomplete"
status/stub means "unimportant and incomplete"


[11/22/2023 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
that seems reasonable. i would also add optional:
- status/needswork/notes (information from non-obsidian notes needs to be incorporated)
- status/needswork/wip (details need to be invented)
- status/needswork/internal (mostly needs cross-check against other notes and/or incorporating comments in the note itself)


[11/22/2023 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
internal could be crosscheck or something else


[11/22/2023 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[11/22/2023 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
the main useful thing here is that if you tag something in sembara needswork, it is helpful for me to known if that means you need to pull information from somewhere, or there are details that are not settled


[11/22/2023 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense


[11/22/2023 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
Although a %% comment can be helpful as well


[11/22/2023 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
internal is also useful before theoretically anyone can work on that even if it isn't "their" area; ideally we'd also add comments to here

{Reactions}
👍

[11/22/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, comments are great, but if I have 20 minutes and want to work on something it is nice to have a way to sort the needswork tags without having to open each note


[11/22/2023 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
yes, agreed


[11/22/2023 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
it's just sometimes hard to distinguish


[11/22/2023 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/22/2023 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
finally on status/refactor - does this mean refactor related to the page structure or note organization (this is how i've used it)
or more like "rethink" - there are details here that I'm not sure should be canon


[11/22/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, maybe rethink is better


[11/22/2023 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I'd use refactor just for the first, and have the second be a different tag


[11/22/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/22/2023 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
rethink is good


[11/22/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
agreed


[11/22/2023 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Here is what I have, putting this on a page:


- **status/needswork**: this note does not contain all of the information about this topic and shouldn't be treated as "complete." optional secondary tags include:
    - **notes**: additional details exist and are recorded in non-Obsidian notes or in someone's head, but haven't yet been captured in Obsidian
    - **wip**: additional details need to invented
    - **internal**: additional details exist in Obsidian, e.g. in the form of dates on other notes, comments in the note itself, etc, but haven't been fully incorporated into the note text
- **status/draft**: this note is largely complete but could use a second opinion / review before being considered canonical. Might need agreement before removing draft status.
- **status/check**: this note has a comment about consistency accuracy and needs someone to do a check
- **status/refactor**: this note has something about it that is not well captured by current Obsidian note organization, and might benefit from refactoring note structure (examples could be narrative history notes that should be refactored into timelines; or item notes that mix general and specific lore)
- **status/rethink**: note is relatively complete but there are details that might need to be rethought; best to include a comment here
- **status/stub** for "I just created this page because I was filling in back links or empty spots on the map but I don't know anything about it and its up for grabs"
- **status/unknown** for the status of the note is unclear


[11/22/2023 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
actually wondering if status/stub is useful


[11/22/2023 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
sounds good


[11/22/2023 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
I guess the absence of needswork is good enough


[11/22/2023 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, don't need to judge whether something is "minor enough" for a status/stub tag


[11/22/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
however I'd say since this relies on the absence of tags to have meaning, probably should start by just marking all notes as status/unknown


[11/22/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that is reasonable


[11/22/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
then i'd suggest for npcs, only remove the unknown tag if it is "your" npc, although feel free to add other tags if it seems reasonably clear

{Reactions}
👍

[11/22/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i will use the tag thing to push this. i'm not going to change any existing tags, just add status/unknown

{Reactions}
👍

[11/22/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
so presence of unknown implies status tags are not  reliable


[11/22/2023 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
are you going to push a tags cleanup as well?


[11/22/2023 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/22/2023 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
ok, I will wait to do anything til that is pushed


[11/22/2023 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
to avoid merge conflict


[11/22/2023 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
give me a few minutes


[11/22/2023 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
yeah no rush, I have  a few work emails I still need to respond to, I will do that 🙂


[11/22/2023 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
it is actually a bit tricky, can't do it in obisidian, so modifying my taelgar-utils to have an "add tag" function


[11/22/2023 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
do you care if I just tag all notes (outside of `_` directories), or should I exclude things like session notes?


[11/22/2023 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
as a side effect this should fix the long-format yaml


[11/22/2023 3:43 PM] .deciusmus

by default appends your obisidan vault location (in the config.json) to the input dir


[11/22/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
try:
`python taelgar_utils.py --output c:\temp\workingspace --dview  --campaign Clee -v .`


[11/22/2023 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
as long as you have "c:\Users\msackton\personal\OneDrive\taelgar" in the config.json file


[11/22/2023 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
ah, I need a config.json?


[11/22/2023 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
missed this
> The `taelgar_utils.py` requires a `config.json` which specifies, at the moment, only the obsidian_path (which should be an absolute path to the root of your Taelgar obsidian folder).


[11/22/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
there should be an example the repo


[11/22/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
`python taelgar_utils.py --help` should be fairly complete as well


[11/22/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus

[11/22/2023 3:51 PM] .deciusmus

[11/22/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, I already use the presence of a 

%%SECRET[]%%

to indicate "there is more to this note then mets the eye"


[11/22/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
right, just something like "merfolk" doesn't have any secret information in it yet


[11/22/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[11/22/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
but obviously is going to come up when you go to the jade garden


[11/22/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/22/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
any reason to keep the dufr/unaware on random cleenseau npcs I'm cleaning up?


[11/22/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
no, delete that


[11/22/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
not using it anymore


[11/22/2023 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Also do you prefer having disambiguation built in or only add if needed? i.e. do you add " of XXX" or other descriptors when creating people with minimal name info?


[11/22/2023 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
or wait for a name conflict


[11/22/2023 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
no clear preference. i think if they'd go by that in-world or if there is likely to be a name conflict, no reason not to just add it if you feel like it, but don't have to be systematic about it


[11/22/2023 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
and just to confirm, absence of status tag = "as much information as exists about this place is in the note"


[11/22/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
one more comment - I am documenting things that are probably true but not confirmed in game in comments, instead of text, e.g. for Dreamhaven:
```
%% notes
Many elves who fled the destruction of Ainumarya fled here, according to Caelynn
%%
```


[11/22/2023 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
I think the key thing is the audience of notes is [Mike, Tim] whereas the audience of body text is [Mike, Tim, Players]


[11/22/2023 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
> and just to confirm, absence of status tag = "as much information as exists about this place is in the note"

Yes that is my intention


[11/22/2023 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yes. 

i don't want to put things that are kind in a state of quantum uncertainty in the actual text, but also want that information to be available, e.g. if you are using the elf I made up and they are talking about where their people went, "they've heard rumors that many ended up in Dreamhaven" is useful to have

[11/22/2023 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
what's the right status for a page that has some upcoming campaign-important info but that "broadly" doesn't need more info


[11/22/2023 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. an NPC I have plans for in the next session


[11/22/2023 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
could just use status/secret, same idea even if it isn't actually "secret"


[11/22/2023 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
or could use status/inprogress or something


[11/22/2023 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
I actually like just using status/secret


[11/22/2023 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
basically a short hand for "DM-specific info pending"


[11/22/2023 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/22/2023 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
honestly, it is probably better to use status/needswork/secret or status/needswork/campaign


[11/22/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/22/2023 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
I then have the luxury of making it status/needswork/internal if I just dump my DM notes in the note itself


[11/22/2023 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
We should probably reserve internal for "all the relevant info is IN the note, it just isn't properly integrated"


[11/22/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/22/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i do need a tag for "needs cross-checking"


[11/22/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
status/factcheck


[11/22/2023 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
isn't that status/check


[11/22/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
status/check is "other person should look at something in a commet"


[11/22/2023 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
maybe we should use

status/draft for "other person should look"

and

status/check for "needs fact checking"


[11/22/2023 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/22/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
or status/factcheck for needs fact checking


[11/22/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
That makes it more clear, i.e. I can add

status/draft 

to Twlight's Grace 

with a note bout what I want you to check.

Or you could add
status/draft
to a note about Sembaran history

or whatever


[11/22/2023 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
whereas status/factcheck can be resolved by the person who added it if you take the time to find the fact.

the code is a bit messy, will try to check it in later


[11/22/2023 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
```dataviewjs
const { util } = customJS
dv.table(["Type", "Name", "Info", "Location"], 
            dv.pages("#person or #organization or #place or #item")
                .where(f => util.isLinkedToPerson(f.file, dv.current().file))
                .sort(b =>util.getType(b))
                .map(b => [util.getType(b), util.getName(b.file.name), util.getInfoLine(b), util.getLoc(b)]))
                
```


[11/22/2023 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
I think status/stub is useful for pages that need full header info and a sentence but not much else


[11/22/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
how hard would it be to make this frontmatter:
```
campaignInfo: 
- { campaign: Wellby, date: 1748-09-30, type: met}
- { campaign: Wellby, date: 1748-10-12, type: last seen}
```
generate these lines:
```
>> %%^Campaign:dufr%% Met by [[Wellby]] on September 30th, 1748 on the [[Wave Dancer]], the [[Eastern Green Sea]] %%^End%%
>> %%^Campaign:dufr%% Last seen by [[Wellby]] on October 12th, 1748 on the [[Wave Dancer]], [[Wahacha]], the [[Vermillion Isles]] %%^End%%
```


[11/22/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. instead of Campaign:Wellby


[11/22/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
For example I was completing the page on the Aben River in Tyrwingha, and decided to make up the name of the river it joins with. But I did not want to set all the frontmatter corretly


[11/22/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
that wouldn't be hard at all


[11/22/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
would need some sort of mapping somewhere to map prefix to some other prefix


[11/22/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
what you probably want instead though is a person:


[11/22/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
i.e.

campaignInfo: 
- { campaign: dufr, person: Wellby, date: 1748-09-30, type: met}

[11/22/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
that's easier and just says: if the person is specified, use getName of that


[11/22/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
instead of getName of DuFr


[11/22/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I have some other JS changes in flight I dont want to push, but if you change

whereaboutsManager.js

getPartyMeeting

let partyName = ...

to 
        let person = element.person ?? element.campaign
                    let partyName = NameManager.getName(person, NameManager.CreateLink, NameManager.PreserveCase)
It should work


[11/22/2023 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
got it


[11/22/2023 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
will test and push


[11/22/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a few other formatting tweaks that would be nice, e.g. having control over displayDefaults in the whereabouts line, so that if someone has two homes (e.g. Vistra), you can change Based in: to Properitor of: only for second home, stuff like that


[11/22/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
but nothing urgent


[11/22/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking for Properitor of using leaderOf


[11/22/2023 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
oh, yeah, that's good


[11/22/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
leaderOf: [ { place: The Name Of Inn, title: Properitor }] should work


[11/22/2023 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
doesn't work for me, but not sure if i have out of date code or what


[11/22/2023 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a fix so that start: 0001 for leaderOf works


[11/22/2023 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
You need a start date


[11/22/2023 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
I should fix it so it doesn’t require a date at all


[11/22/2023 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
But at the moment it requires reignStart in frontmatter or start: in the leaderOf line


[11/22/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
I just pushed a fix so that at least start: 0001 means “no start display” rather than show something weird


[11/22/2023 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, got that


[11/22/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
that's pretty nice


[11/22/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus

I’m mostly cooking / hanging out with Z&Dana today but to the extent I’m working on stuff I’m thinking of cleaning up Gazeetteer:

- make pages for all place names that don’t currently have them
- potentially make up some names for features that don’t have them
- create ~name~ pages for unnamed features that exist 

My plan is to tag new names with status/namecheck and put in Gazeetter. Anything without a name I’ll tag with status/needs work and put in Worldbuilding/unnamed

I'm still working on halflings while waiting for my pie crust to chill


[11/23/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
what is the code to get an events table for a person?


[11/23/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
(e.g. all events that mention that person's name)


[11/23/2023 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
There is a get_eventtable but I’m not sure it works


[11/23/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
The stuff I was messing around with last night I didn’t commit


[11/23/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
I probably should


[11/23/2023 9:42 AM] .deciusmus
Events are harder though because its not just getting pages


[11/23/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
BTW, I completed all my halflings. So you can have a 100% done halflings set when you are done with halflings


[11/23/2023 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus
halflings done and pushed fyi


[11/23/2023 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
Cool. I’m working on gazetteer stuff. Should push an update soon. I’m creating ~xxx~ pages for all the major features and regions we have discussed or are obvious on the map


[11/23/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed an update that has a template place name for almost everything we’ve ever talked about or that is mapped. I petered out around Voltara because I wasn’t sure which things you might have made names for


[11/23/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
I saw that. i just merged my stuff from the climate branch, which also has some place names (dangling links)


[11/23/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
will try to resolve any duplicates

[11/23/2023 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
What do you think of Aelvarsk for the highland kingdom region


[11/23/2023 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
And Elvare for “greater sembara” lowland regions


[11/23/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
need to let it sit for a bit


[11/23/2023 3:10 PM] .deciusmus
I’m much less sold on Elvare or even the need for a name. But I feel like the highland kingdoms area needs a name that isn’t “the highland kingdoms”


[11/23/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
Two others from chat gpt 

Jarviskar 
Isbrek


[11/24/2023 9:08 AM] rsulfuratus
what are these names for, exactly? e.g., is this geographic region of the sentinel foothills; the cultural designation for the highland kingdom area, something else?


[11/24/2023 9:08 AM] rsulfuratus
taking a page from Scotland, it could make sense to just have: "Sembaran Highlands" and "Sembaran Lowlands"


[11/24/2023 9:20 AM] .deciusmus
The general region of the highland kingdoms. I don’t think they would call themselves “sembaran highlands” though


[11/24/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess I don't have a good sense of whether this would be a coherent region as seen from within. like, would someone from Breva think of themselves as a person from Breva and from Jarviskar or whatever?


[11/24/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
the drankorians definitely would have called them "the Sembaran highlands"


[11/24/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
of course one complication with that is there is already a highlands region of sembara


[11/24/2023 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
Basically I think originally we called this area “Greater Sembara” and then we had “highland kingdoms” and “Tyrwingha” and such as subparts of “Greater Sembara”


[11/24/2023 9:31 AM] .deciusmus
But as I’ve developed the history I’m not happy with that naming


[11/24/2023 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
In particular I don’t think the “highland kingdoms” would ever consider themselves part of “Sembara”


[11/24/2023 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
They have a long and independent history and were only ruled from Sembara for ~100 years around the Great War


[11/24/2023 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
so, I think it depends on where Sembara comes from


[11/24/2023 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
take this scenario, for example


[11/24/2023 9:35 AM] .deciusmus
Well, I created the Duchy of Sembara and the river Semb as a source for the name of the kingdom


[11/24/2023 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
river names often stick around for a long time, so perhaps the Drankorians came and the local people said the river was the Semb, and so in the Drankorian empire these were known as the Sembaran provinces


[11/24/2023 9:36 AM] .deciusmus
Right, the river name is probably ancient


[11/24/2023 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
in Drankorian geography, Sembaran would refer to the entire Semb rivershed, basically everything from the Sentinels to the Green Sea, south of the Volta and north of the hills


[11/24/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
the duchy of Sembara takes its name from this


[11/24/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
the parallel is Great Britain


[11/24/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
Although Great Britain is a counter example to me. Sembara = England, Tyrwingha = wales, highland kingdoms = Scotland


[11/24/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
but the island is called Great Britain


[11/24/2023 9:38 AM] rsulfuratus
which derives from latin


[11/24/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
and if the Angles hadn't moved in between the end of the roman empire and the growth of the english kingdoms, England very likely could just be Britain


[11/24/2023 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
I guess there is no reason you couldn’t have had Britain as the name of the English kingdom


[11/24/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
since England = land of the Angles and Britain = land of the britons


[11/24/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
which isn't to say that a name for "Scotland" = highland kingdoms isn't worth having


[11/24/2023 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
but probably it should be "land of the X"


[11/24/2023 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure have a name for the people who live there


[11/24/2023 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
it is actually probably useful to develop names for all the various subcultures since that makes naming regions a lot easier, since some many  names in the real world are just "land of the X"


[11/24/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
this is what I was trying to do with Vostok and Skaehem (which are land of the Vos and land of the Skaer)


[11/24/2023 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
You’ve slightly convinced me though that Sembara is actually the appropriate name. 

The derivation would be:
Drankorians appear and are told basically “we are the people of the Semb river valley, ie the Sembarans” (at the time the drankorians arrived the highland/lowland distinction was fairly minimal)

They don’t conquer the highlands, but the provinces are called Sembaran provinces (ala “Gaulish or British provinces”)

The highlanders themselves continue to refer to themselves as “sembaran“ or “free sembarans” or “highland sembarans”

And today there is just the Sembaran lowlands and the Sembaran highlands


[11/24/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
On the other hand, it probably is pretty reasonable for the sembaran highlanders to have developed a new name for themselves, or linguistic change to have happened differently, etc


[11/24/2023 9:50 AM] .deciusmus
Today (1720/1750) it seems to me the four highland kingdoms would have much more in common with each other than with sembara


[11/24/2023 9:54 AM] .deciusmus
All *that* said, for worldbuilding/in game reference purposes, it seems nicer to have a word for the highland kingdoms as I find it unsatisifying to refer to the language as "highlander" and so on. And there is an actual region of the kingdom of Sembara that is called the Sembaran Highlands as well. In the real world things end up with confusing names all the time, but I'd prefer to not have this particular situation be confusing


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] .deciusmus
So if we can come up with a good name for the "land where the people of Lavnoch, Breva, Ardlas, and Zovcka live" it probably makes sense


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
i think a name for the people is most useful


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
then you'd just have X-land


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] rsulfuratus
and also a name for the language


[11/24/2023 9:55 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, agreed


[11/24/2023 10:11 AM] .deciusmus
On a totally different topic, I am refactoring the Javascript stuff pretty significantly


[11/24/2023 10:11 AM] .deciusmus
I'm moving towards an architecture where there is a string formatter class that takes strings in the form of:

"Some data <token:format>"

and applies the format


[11/24/2023 10:12 AM] .deciusmus
This is designed to centralize all formatting of locations and dates so that we can more easily add fancy features (like approximate dates or location slices)


[11/24/2023 10:12 AM] .deciusmus
It also makes it much easier to use pieces of frontmatter logic in dataview queries, i.e. to allow for things like the secondary line or pronunciation or pronouns in a "members of" table


[11/24/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
i am hopefully going to push a new taeglarverse build today with session 82 session notes, fwiw


[11/24/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
a string formatter makes a lot of sense and will also be worth implementing in python (the more things that can be moved to classes with clearly defined functions the simpler the translation is in my experience)


[11/24/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
but it might be a while before I get to it


[11/24/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
It shouldn't matter a ton, except that python won't have access to certain new features, i.e. if we add splices to loc


[11/24/2023 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
The basic idea is that the DV scripts (like get_pageDatedValue, get_Whereabouts) are for picking a format string


[11/24/2023 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
I'm still trying to figure out exactly the best solution to your whereabouts problem


[11/24/2023 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
it seems like allowing specific display overrides on particular whereabouts lines (or campaignInfo lines) should be fairly easy, you just check if whereabout.displayDefaults exists and then if it does just use your merge code to create a new format string, in buildFormattedLocationString


[11/24/2023 10:32 AM] .deciusmus
the challenge for whereabouts is you don't know if the whereabouts line is going to be a current location or a last known location or a home location


[11/24/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
I need to go back and read your example, but I am not sure if you need to know the usage type of the whereabout to know what to put in the string


[11/24/2023 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
I'm also a bit nervous about slicing  because it is susceptible to unpredictable changes if you reorganize a region or something


[11/24/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
Like, if I added a "Greater Sembara" region everything that sliced that was rooted back at Sembara could get weird.


[11/24/2023 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
it wouldn't change anything more than already


[11/24/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
i wasn't thinking of arbitrary slices


[11/24/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
just continuous slices


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
so for location chain a-b-c-d-e-f, you can pick to display b-c-d instead of a-b-c


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
not you can pick a-c-f


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
so a start + count only, not arbitrary ranges


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/24/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
i agree arbitrary ranges get wonky


[11/24/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
the use case is really for something like buliding a full whereabouts for delwath


[11/24/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
you'd want a good chunk of that time to be in "Dunmar Fellowship"


[11/24/2023 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
but you don't (necessarily) want the location to be "Dunmar Fellowship, Vindristjarna, Vetta"


[11/24/2023 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
you might prefer: "Vetta, Skaer Islands, Western Green Sea"


[11/24/2023 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus
or for a lot of my chardonian adventurers, if i build a full whereabouts, I don't want to copy and past, I want a whereabouts container


[11/24/2023 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
right, so it is mostly about skipping to the "actual" location


[11/24/2023 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/24/2023 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
Would it make more sense to have a filter for only showing actual location pieces?


[11/24/2023 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
<loc:p> = location with places only


[11/24/2023 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that might be easier


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
but, you'd still want that to be applied per-whereabouts


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., for antonia, I don't want to skip over Mirror of Soul Trapping


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
right, but I actually think the "per whereabouts" is just the formatter


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
but do probably want to skip over "Kadmos Team"


[11/24/2023 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. you do not want to say: "Currently in: <loc:p>"


[11/24/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
you want to just say:

{ type: away, location: Dunmar Fellowship, format: p }


[11/24/2023 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
ah yes, that would work


[11/24/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
What you really want is a selector for what type of things to show


[11/24/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
format: pio shows places, organizations, and items is the default


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
but it is also useful to adjust the location size by whereabout as well


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
right


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
that still works


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
so you could do format: 10p


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
means 10 sizes, places only


[11/24/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
or format 10ip means 10 pieces items and places only


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
format 10 means 10 pieces, items, places, and organizations


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
I'd actually prefer to have an exclude


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
maybe o means exclude organizations, i means exclude items, etc


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
p would mean exclude people


[11/24/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
the one reason to still do slices, although maybe there is a better solution, is i started putting the whereabouts of some people as, e.g., an inn, so that the Met by Party line would show the specific meeting location


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but I don't necessarily like the actual location of the person to be the inn


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
right you'd like to allow subtypes of places


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
but that gets confusing to represent in single characters


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. exclude place/inn


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
but maybe a slice is better for that


[11/24/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
because you know it is always the first one


[11/24/2023 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
probably p = exclude places, i= exclude items, o = exclude organizations, f = exclude first would be sufficient


[11/24/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
you might also want an exclude person


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I would use p for exclude person


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure you'd ever want to exclude places, really


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
and l for exclude places


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
maybe in a whereabout of an item


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
sure if you just want to track the owner/maker


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/24/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
same with organizations


[11/24/2023 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
org and item whereabouts lines use loc:1 often


[11/24/2023 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
to avoid showing the full details


[11/24/2023 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
but loc:l to exclude locations works better


[11/24/2023 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
you could also use casing, i.e. L P O I could mean include only  locations people organizations items


[11/24/2023 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
and F


[11/24/2023 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
actually if you did that plus R r for regions


[11/24/2023 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
You could probably get rid of the counting entirely, i.e. you could say:

R = include regions only; r = exclude regions (i.e. places with typeOf region)
L = include locations only; l = exclude locations
P = include people only; p = exclude people
I = include items only; p = exclude items
F = include first step only; f = exclude first step
O = include organizations only; o = exclude organizations


[11/24/2023 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
so this would be very easy to do in python, you just record the location chain as a list of dicts and then you can use a lamba function to filter however you want, it is like one line of code


[11/24/2023 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
but you want to split the get_location_from_part_of into two functions


[11/24/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
one that builds the chain, one that formats the array once you have it


[11/24/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure the javascript approach


[11/24/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
Haven't looked but it isn't hard


[11/24/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
when formatting a whereabout which wins? the <loc:xxx> or the inside the whereabout version?


[11/24/2023 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
I guess the inside the whereabout one


[11/24/2023 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
presumably it has to be the inside the whereabouts


[11/24/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. if you had:

whereaboutsCurrent: "Based in: <loc:pi>"

and then a whereabout like:

{ type: , location: , format: fp }

presumably you want to end up formatting using fp not pi


[11/24/2023 11:01 AM] .deciusmus
There is some complexity about whether you follow whereabouts or partof if you have both


[11/24/2023 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
I think you should always follow whereabouts if it exists


[11/24/2023 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
conceptually, partOf: <loc> for places is just shorthand for whereabouts: {type: home, location: <loc>}


[11/24/2023 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus
since it (almost). never makes sense for a place to have a whereabouts line


[11/24/2023 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus
although imagine an inn that is teleported from Chardon to Tollen


[11/24/2023 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
I think the end state should be:
* A format string logic as per the above
* A set of different replacements that represent different things you might care about

> <current:format>:  this represents the current location of an item and uses the "current" whereabout as of the current fantasy date. it follows current whereabouts if current exists, but if current doesn't exist on the first item it uses last known instead. When using last know if follows the chain using the last known's date, rather than the current date. If a page further up the chain doesn't have current, it terminates with unknown unless the page has a partOf

> <onlycurrent:format> : this represents the current location of an item and uses the "current" whereabout as of the current fantasy date. it follows current whereabouts up the chain or partofs if there is no current whereabout. Unlike current it never uses last known and will report Unknown if there is no current

> <partof:format>: this represents what the thing is part of. it never looks at whereabouts and can be used to present something other than a location, i.e. an organization is part of a larger organization or a phasing stone is part of Vindistraja

> <origin:format>: this is the same as current but when following the chain it uses the page creation date, not the current date

> <home:format>: this follows home whereabouts if they exist, otherwise partof. It won't follow current whereabouts (i.e. an away whereabout)


[11/24/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
The reason to distinguish partof and current is because an organization could have both


[11/24/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
or an item could have both


[11/24/2023 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus
but if you are following a location chain you always want the whereabouts


[11/24/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
right but you might want to follow the partOf chain instead


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] rsulfuratus
but only for a place


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] .deciusmus
or an organization or item


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] .deciusmus
or even a person


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] rsulfuratus
but when would you want to follow the partOf for an item?


[11/24/2023 11:15 AM] .deciusmus
an item on Vindistraja


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
you might want the header line to be:

(<rarity> <etc> <partof:I>)


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
so it would be (a rare magical phasing stone on Vindistraja)


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, I guess that is a bit weird


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
because you would probably just use whereabouts


[11/24/2023 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
The better use case is organizations


[11/24/2023 11:17 AM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/24/2023 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
the Cleenseau Garrison is partOf: Dunfry Regiment and whereabouts: Cleenseau


[11/24/2023 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
you then want to show both:

Parent Organization: <partof>
Based in: <home>


[11/24/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm only talking about what you do when you are building a location chain


[11/24/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., if a person has Cleenseau Garrison as their whereabouts


[11/24/2023 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
conceptually, that means, "this person is where the Cleenseau Garrison is"


[11/24/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
right but I think you want to distinguish different bits


[11/24/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
see the spec above


[11/24/2023 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
<current:x> means "current location" following the current whereabouts if there are any whereabouts and partof only if there are not


[11/24/2023 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
your spec seems too complicated to me but maybe i'm missing something


[11/24/2023 11:22 AM] rsulfuratus
my take is whereabouts are a super useful way to speed up notetaking once you get using them, because many items and people move around in clumps, so you just need to track the clump and then you can put the whereabouts of the things in the clump as "clump"


[11/24/2023 11:22 AM] rsulfuratus
but to make this sensible requires tweaking display a bit


[11/24/2023 11:22 AM] .deciusmus
Right, my goal is slightly different and maybe not clear


[11/24/2023 11:22 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not talking about formatting the whereabouts line itself or rules on the whereabouts line


[11/24/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
I'm talking about trying to generalize the formatting so you can make a data view table like:

column 1 = "<typeof>, <pronouns>"
column 2 = "<current>


[11/24/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
and that works but you could also add a column 3

column 3 = "<partof:1>"


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
and have it all mean something


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
ah, i see


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
for the whereabouts line itself, you'd just have {format:x}


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
so, i think i would simplify that, though


[11/24/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
then the "whereaboutsCurrent" in the display defaults would be "Currently in: <current>"


[11/24/2023 11:25 AM] rsulfuratus
I actually kind of think we should replace partOf: x with whereabouts: x in places


[11/24/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, arguably partOf doesn't need to exist for anything


[11/24/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
for organizations it is affiliations


[11/24/2023 11:26 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. the Cleenseau garrison is not "part of" the Dunfry regiment, it is affliated with and has a primary affiiation typeof set correctly


[11/24/2023 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
conceptually leaderOf is not really meaningful either


[11/24/2023 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think there are really just 2 relationships:
whereabouts and affiliations


[11/24/2023 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
so, i would argue you are overgeneralizing a little bit


[11/24/2023 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
whereabouts only ever means one thing: where is this in space


[11/24/2023 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
but affiliations gets complicated if it has to track a large number of different relationships


[11/24/2023 11:29 AM] .deciusmus
isn't it just

{ title: , thing: , start:, end:, isLeader: }


[11/24/2023 11:29 AM] .deciusmus
leaderOf is definitely being misused for "navigator of the x"


[11/24/2023 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, that is a display hack


[11/24/2023 11:29 AM] .deciusmus
entirely because you can't set the title of an affliation


[11/24/2023 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
but yeah I think generalizing the leaderOf structure could work


[11/24/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think "affiliation" just means:

this specific creature or group of creatures is associated with this other group of creatures


[11/24/2023 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
it makes dataview queries a bit hairer


[11/24/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
it does


[11/24/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
but whereabouts: x instead of partof: x has the same problem


[11/24/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
basically it requires mostly using javascript helpers


[11/24/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
and actually it works fine


[11/24/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
as long as you don't care about dates


[11/24/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. this query works

table from #person where contains(affiliations, "Drankor") or contains(affiliations.org, "Drankor")


[11/24/2023 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
in the case where I have one page with

affiliations: [ Drankor ]

and another page with

affiliations: [ {org: Drankor }]


[11/24/2023 11:35 AM] .deciusmus
this also works:

table from #person where contains(whereabouts, "Cleenseau") or contains(whereabouts.location, "Cleenseau")


[11/24/2023 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah i just tested the same thing


[11/24/2023 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
It just ignores the types and dates; so you end up with everything that has ever been somewhere (or anything that has ever been affiliated with something)


[11/24/2023 11:37 AM] .deciusmus
but I actually think i.e. for checking the part of chains of places, its totally fine to just ignore that


[11/24/2023 11:37 AM] .deciusmus
the teleporting inn appears in both Chardon and Tollen's list - who cares?


[11/24/2023 11:37 AM] .deciusmus
and if you want perfect accuracy there is always javascript helpers


[11/24/2023 11:38 AM] .deciusmus
but collapsing leaderOf / partOf for organizations / affliations into one thing actually is appealing from a simplification standpoint


[11/24/2023 11:38 AM] .deciusmus
You end up getting the same display as before, with just "Member" being the default title for affiliations with no title


[11/24/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
but it lets you specify dates for affliations if you want


[11/24/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. Antonia when she becomes a key NPC in the far northern 1760s campaign, could have

affiliation: [ {org: The Cleansed, start: xxx, end: yyy }]


[11/24/2023 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
that is nice


[11/24/2023 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
i think instead of just isLeader, you need  "leader of" and "subordinate to" relationships


[11/24/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
Right that gets into the ruledBy stuff I was trying to avoid


[11/24/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for "Kadmos Team" org, you have:
- affiliated with Society of the Open Scroll
- ruled by The Cleansed


[11/24/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
I think a type: on affiliation that currently supports “none” or “leader” is probably a good starting spot


[11/24/2023 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/24/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
And see where it goes


[11/24/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
Anyway afk for a bit. Will revisit some of this later


[11/24/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm actually


[11/24/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
there are really three display options:
halfling, she/her, of the AFF1
---
Queen of AFF2
---
Member of: AFF3


[11/24/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
I think you want those to be tracked in the affiliation object


[11/24/2023 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
so:
type = primary, leader, none


[11/24/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
that works fine for people, but using affliations to track organizational relationships also implies a partOf


[11/24/2023 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus
that is, I might want the Voltara Legion to be:
Voltara Legion
a garrison in the Chardonian Army
Based In: Voltara


[11/24/2023 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but I don't want the Chardonian Army to be:
Leader of Voltara Garrison, Myraeni Garrison, Chardon Garrison, Chasa Garrison, Valandros Garrison, etc, etc


[11/24/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe part of actually does make sense for orgs


[11/24/2023 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
It could be unitOf instead


[11/24/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
so I think minimally you want:
- primary (implies of XXX in the secondary info line)
- leader (implies Leader of XXX in separate lie)
- partof (imples A <typeof> in XXX in separate line)
- none (implies Member Of: XXX)


[11/24/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Ah you are suggesting using it as affiliation type


[11/24/2023 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus
whether those are all combined into a single affiliations line or not i think is more about ease of programming or ease of querying


[11/24/2023 11:49 AM] rsulfuratus
but I think at least in the notes I've worked on / am thinking about, those are the four types of affiliation relationships that should be separately tracked/displayed


[11/24/2023 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
honestly having it all in one affiliations object would be way simpler for primary affiliations, which currently were quite annoying for the halflings because I had to make a stub note for every halfling family with typeOf: family


[11/24/2023 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
so i think i'd lean towards putting everything as an affiliation type, which is also more easily extensible if we think of another relationships that needs to be captured (maybe feudal relationships for example)


[11/24/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
Right so I think getting rid of leader of and primary affiliation and just having a type line of “primary” | “leader” | “member”

Last is the default. 

Makes sense


[11/24/2023 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
Of course if the primary affiliation is dated then it has to be dynamic but I suppose that is rare


[11/24/2023 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
Part of is less clear. Need a bit of thought. 
All affiliations would support the dates and title features of leader of


[11/24/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
Display logic and allow for either

Non primary affiliations 
Primary affiliations
All affiliations


[11/24/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
Currently leader would be unused except for 

- leader title defaults to page title


[11/24/2023 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
Let me mess around with this a bit later today


[11/24/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
I want to finish the string format refactor first. But I might implement the affiliation stuff before the whereabouts format stuff

{Reactions}
👍

[11/24/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID Link.file.name as Note, join(split(meta(Link).path,"/",2),"/") as Folder, Link as Link, choice(contains(Link.tags, "status/unknown"), "check", choice(contains(Link.tags, "status"), "wip", "complete")) As Status
FROM "Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier/Session Notes/Session 81 (DuFr)"
FLATTEN file.outlinks as Link
WHERE Link
GROUP BY Link
```


[11/24/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
gets all the notes that link to a specific page, with status info. could probably be neater in javascript


[11/24/2023 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but is great for prioritizing updating notes that are linked to session notes


[11/24/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
I’ve made some progress on refactor. 

Basically all string display and composition is based on the new string formatter class.


[11/24/2023 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
It takes -dozen special <xxx> strings plus will fall back to just looking at metadata


[11/24/2023 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
The special ones are:
- current: get the current whereabouts for this page and follow the chain using the “now” date
- “home” currently same as current except it starts from home 
- “origin” starts are origin and follows chain at page creation date or 0001 if there is no page creation date
- lastknown: starts with last known and follows at “end date” of last known


[11/24/2023 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
Logically I’m planning on getting rid of part of. These chain following functions will only follow whereabouts


[11/24/2023 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
For back compat a page with type = place, partOf set, no whereabouts will act like a single whereabouts with the part of value


[11/24/2023 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
The get_xxx methods then are just about selecting the right format string


[11/24/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
do you think it is worth keeping the "primary affiliation" stuff for backwards compat or is it fine to have to update all the pages to have

affiliations: [ {org: Goodbarrels, type: primary}] if you want Of xxx to appear?


[11/24/2023 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
its fine to not retain backwards compatibility. its a static line anyway


[11/24/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
Any opinion on the "org" bit?


[11/24/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't want to use affiliation as it is long to type


[11/24/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
currently supporting either

{ org: xxx }

or

{ place: xxx }

where 

{ place: xxx } is shorthand for { place:xxx, type: leader }


[11/24/2023 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
org is fine


[11/24/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
I assume you don't really need to see:

Properitor of The Salty Pig, Fiskirk, Tollen


[11/24/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
Or do you want that?


[11/24/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't think so


[11/24/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
it is a lot easier to not have that for now


[11/24/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
I'm about to push a major rewrite of the Javascript to a branch


[11/24/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm about to push session notes


[11/24/2023 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
There are likely some bugs but it is a lot more flexible


[11/24/2023 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
I'll try to write a bit of a guide


[11/24/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
adding some more notes to test cases (ones that use the new features and work) is almost as useful


[11/24/2023 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
true


[11/24/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
A lot of it is magic formatting strings:

     // t: title case; s: lower case, u: initial upper case
        // a: indefinite article, A: indefinite article if first
        // n: never link, y: always link


[11/24/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
so you can do stuff like (<ancestry:A> <typeof:A)

and it will get you

a Sembaran human
or
a human

but not

a a human or a Sembaran a human


[11/24/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
Affiliations are also no longer static


[11/24/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
because they are normalized with regnal stuff


[11/24/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have any examples of complex intercrossing whereabouts chains?


[11/24/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
Or did you not commit them because they didn't really work?


[11/25/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
garret tealeaf would be a good example, if you built a tealeaf whereabouts and a charmhearts whereabouts he could be tealeaf -> lair -> dufr -> charmhearts. but i didn't abstract out anyones whereabouts yet


[11/25/2023 9:16 AM] rsulfuratus
was going to use it for the various chardonian adventures when i get a chance.


[11/25/2023 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
I'll play with that. You haven't published session 81 notes yet have you?


[11/25/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
no, but they are pushed


[11/25/2023 9:56 AM] rsulfuratus
ah session 81 yes, not session 82


[11/25/2023 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
I kinda want to merge my changes relatively soon to reduce conflicts but it might cause some publish challenges for a bit until we sort out the bugs


[11/25/2023 9:59 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm going to rebuild website in next 30 minutes


[11/25/2023 10:00 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed all changes i will make before website build, so feel free to merge


[11/25/2023 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
Have you had a chance to look at the changes? The big one is that <loc> is no longer valid and you can use <current> <home> <origin> or <lastknown>


[11/25/2023 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus
no, i've been working on content


[11/25/2023 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
Also partOf on places is treated same as whereabouts


[11/25/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
whereas "part of" is still meaningful for organizations


[11/25/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
so i.e. the Dunfry Regiment can be partOf Army of the West and whereabouts: Dunfry


[11/25/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
whereabouts Dunfry (if the page says "partOf Barony of Dunfry) is treated as if it said whereabouts: Barony of Dunfry


[11/26/2023 9:17 AM] rsulfuratus
how do you control location partOf depth now? e.g. if you had <loc:2> before


[11/26/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
Do you mean part of? Usually you want current


[11/26/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
Which works with current:2 as before


[11/26/2023 9:18 AM] .deciusmus
Part of is now only for organizations


[11/26/2023 9:18 AM] rsulfuratus
current:2 doesn't do anything


[11/26/2023 9:19 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm it should


[11/26/2023 9:19 AM] rsulfuratus
ah nevermind


[11/26/2023 9:19 AM] rsulfuratus
typo


[11/26/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
a few comments after fiddling for a bit:
1. it would be great to move the default required object defined on line 177 of nameManager to metadata.json. it is nice to see all the defaults in one place.


[11/26/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
2. i might also change a few of the defaults, minimally I'd set all the locations back to 3 in most cases, and i think "halfling (he/him), of the Charmhearts" generally looks better than "a halfling, he/him of the Charmhearts" -- but this is pretty minor. i might also make some of the affiliation defaults shorter (like not put age/length when there are start/end dates). generally i'd probably default to making the header shorter and more compact, and then use overrides to make it longer when needed


[11/26/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
3. the biggest remaining QoL improvement would be to allow format overrides per line in affiliation and campaignInfo


[11/26/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if I have `campaign: dufr, person: Wellby, date: 1730, type: met`


[11/26/2023 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
I want to be able to generate:
`Met by Wellby around DR 1730 at The Singing Fox, in Fairgate Outer, the Free City of Tollen`


[11/26/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
For #2 feel free to change defaults whereever you want, I'm not committed to particular defaults


[11/26/2023 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
For #1, on my list


[11/26/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
But the main reason I did it the way I did is it is pain when debugging to have it in metadata.json as you have to remember to reload the metadata which I often forget to do


[11/26/2023 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
something like:
`format: <type> by <person> around <start> at <current:F> in <current:f2>`


[11/26/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
it would be fairly trivial to add overrides to affliation and campaign info


[11/26/2023 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus
that would also allow something like different defaults for leaders and non-leaders for affiliations


[11/26/2023 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. place: xxx could be shorthand for org: place, type: leader, format: xxxx


[11/26/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
the tricky bit I think is getting the order of operations right


[11/26/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if you have:
`{type: home, location: The Singing Fox, format: fr}`


[11/26/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
and also `<current:F>` in your campaignInfo format


[11/26/2023 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
the campaignInfo should override the whereabouts format string


[11/26/2023 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
when you determine a format string the order should be something like:
required defaults < type defaults < page defaults < whereabouts format string < campaign info format string / affiliation format string


[11/26/2023 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
the presumption is that if you are adding a specific override string for a campaignInfo line, you know what it should generate and you wantt to have a specific, exact format


[11/26/2023 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
That last bit is hardest


[11/26/2023 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
because the string format doesn't know where the format string is coming from


[11/26/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
i think the way to do it is just have the string formatter trust the string it is passed and not try to update it


[11/26/2023 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
but it needs to for whereabouts


[11/26/2023 10:31 AM] .deciusmus
anyway, will think about it


[11/26/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
architecturally, the way I would do this in python is try to build a data object for each page that contained everything - all possible locations, all possible affiliations, all format strings. but, i think that doesn't make sense for the javascript functions which need to work on continually updated pages instead of a fixed directory of static text


[11/26/2023 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
but i have the feeling that 1300 lines of code is more than we need for what we are trying to do and there is probably a clever way to simpilfy things that would also make some of this easier


[11/26/2023 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm just not sure what it is yet


[11/26/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a spec, fyi


[11/26/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
or more accurately, documentation


[11/26/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
The problem is that the format hierarchies are a bit of a pain here. The simplest would be to have something like ! mean “this wins”


[11/26/2023 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
So if you have a format string of !f in the party line it wins over the whereabouts format


[11/26/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
That could be useful in general if you wanted a generic table to always show something


[11/26/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/26/2023 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not going to spend a ton of time on this today as I've got other things to do but i am currently trying to just make sure I understand all the new code in case I want to try to work on python implementation

{Reactions}
👍

[11/26/2023 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
Makes sense. We are going out hiking today so also not spending much time on it but might implement the ! rule as discussed above. The key for python is to just reimplement the string formatter I think. The get_xxx functions are really simple now


[11/26/2023 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
assume you are out hiking, i am switching between work work and going over code. opening issues for each class to track questions/potential refactors/potential bugs


[11/26/2023 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
not going to edit any code at the moment


[11/26/2023 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
okay lied about not editing code, pushed some edits to code_cleanup branch


[11/26/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
so I think you are not quite right about how whereabouts should work...  I'm leaving some comments on the github issue


[11/26/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
but I do think that last known should contain the current, i.e. last known is never undefined


[11/26/2023 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
look at the code in code_cleanup, it is way shorter and so far displays identical things, except fixes the bug in Apollyon where it doesn't display a last known location


[11/26/2023 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i had to change the part of to check if current location is unknown instead of exists


[11/26/2023 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so far the only difference is that if you have a home but not an origin, you get "Origin unknown" text, which I like, but would be easy to remove either via code or a format string


[11/26/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
I am not sure I agree that causing all the locations to exist with "unknowns" is better


[11/26/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
*all the whereabouts


[11/26/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
why not?


[11/26/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
it removes context - you can't decide things based on whether it exists or not


[11/26/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe there are not any cases you care, but I think origin is at least one of them


[11/26/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
You need some mechanism to conditionally display origin as unknown or not unknown


[11/26/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it is clearer as a property of the page:


[11/26/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so, what I wanted to eventually do was have "display this if it is unknown" be a format string


[11/26/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. I want to be able to distinguish between "this person's origin is canonically unknown" vs "no thoughts on origin"


[11/26/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
but it shouldn't be a display string


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I don't see those as being any different


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
I think its nicer to add the unknown whereabout than add the display string


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
although I suppose it depends on where you come down on the default


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
if you think the default should be everyone has an unknown origin, if their home has a start date, I guess that makes sense


[11/26/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the use case for a format string is to get:
Current Location: the Emerald Song, unknown


[11/26/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
but is that an origin?


[11/26/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
that is a home or current whereabout, right?


[11/26/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, the location chain always follows current


[11/26/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, more accurately, that is an argument for having the whereabout have a defined unknown location


[11/26/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
But it doesn't have to be so for home and origin, necessarily


[11/26/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but back to the origin unknown case, I consider:
- {type: home, start: 1725, location:  Tollen } 
to mean that yes, canonically, the origin is unknown


[11/26/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
the only way you can ever have an unknown origin is to have no known location at birth, which can only arise if you intentionally make it so that there is no known origin at birth


[11/26/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
right although you broke that case I think in your refactor


[11/26/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
But, yes, I see the point. The setting of a start date on home implies unknown origin


[11/26/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
actually nevermind it does work


[11/26/2023 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway have to start dinner more in a bit though


[11/26/2023 6:26 PM] .deciusmus
So I thought about this some more when I was making dinner (now in the oven) and I think the basic concern is that the codebase is getting littered with "if location == "unknown"" which would be much clearer if the location was just undefined


[11/26/2023 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
That is, I would:

(a) change logic so that last known is returned always (if there is either a last known or a current)
(b) change logic so that current, lastknown, etc always are returned, but the location is undefined, if it isn't known
(c) change follow logic for last known so it follows at the last known date only if it is in the past, current date otherwise
(d) change string formatter so that last known doesn't fall back to current


[11/26/2023 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
Then I would add the following strings to metadata.json

whereaboutsOriginUnknown - used if the origin is not known
whereaboutsCurrentUnknown - used if the current is not known
whereaboutsHomeUnknown - used if the home is not known
whereaboutsLastKnownUnknown - used if the last known is not known

and remove the whereaboutsUnknown


[11/26/2023 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
Then, the get_Whereabouts logic adds the unknown case into the format string generation, i.e. so the "home" string is either past/unknown/etc


[11/26/2023 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
see, I have the exact opposite opinion. I think that if you want to filter unknown locations, you should explicitly say so in the code


[11/26/2023 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
so far I've only had to add one single filter, with the get location from parts code


[11/26/2023 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
everything else works exactly as it is, because the only time it matters if a location is unknown is for display


[11/26/2023 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
internally, an undefined location is just an unknown location


[11/26/2023 6:31 PM] .deciusmus
see, I disagree


[11/26/2023 6:32 PM] .deciusmus
and you have special cases in the get_whereabouts as well


[11/26/2023 6:32 PM] rsulfuratus
but that is where you should have special cases


[11/26/2023 6:32 PM] rsulfuratus
part of the issue is that java and python have very different ideas about what undefined means


[11/26/2023 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
filtering on whereabouts.location == "Unknown" works


[11/26/2023 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, technically this should be null not undefined


[11/26/2023 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
I just didn't know the different when I starting writing the code


[11/26/2023 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
but filtering on !whereabouts.location works better


[11/26/2023 6:34 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure what use case you are envisioning


[11/26/2023 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
filtering on location being falsey requires that:
a) we add special handling for unknown locations, because by default they get removed
b) I need to carefully debug python code because falsey is not defined the same way in python and java


[11/26/2023 6:35 PM] .deciusmus
To me, writing code like:

if (home.location == "Unknown") formatStr = whereaboutsUnknownHome

is really messy


[11/26/2023 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is telling me expiclity what the code is trying to do


[11/26/2023 6:36 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure where you are envisioning (a), I guess is the problem


[11/26/2023 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
it also means that you get the same results for { type: away, location: Unknown } and { type: away } which to me is the desired behavior


[11/26/2023 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
if I want to generate a table in dataviewjs with all items without defined makers, for example


[11/26/2023 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
or without defined Owners


[11/26/2023 6:38 PM] .deciusmus
sure, but 

something like:

where(f => !util.gw(f).origin.location)

is much more pleasant to read than

where(f => util.gw(f).origin.location == "Unknown")


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
First, just because it is shorter, so it is nicer


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
Second, because the "unknown" logic elides the difference between "not defined" and "defined as not known"


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
So I think the second point is our fundamental disagreement


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I want to elide that difference


[11/26/2023 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
Why?


[11/26/2023 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
If I am doing data cleanup, I don't want to be bothered with the stuff someone has explicitly defined as unkown


[11/26/2023 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure the use case you want them to be the same, actually


[11/26/2023 6:43 PM] .deciusmus
If I am creating a table of all of the people either in or based in a place, I might do something like:

where(f => util.inOrBasedInLoc(f, "Cleenseau")
map(f => [util.s(f, "<name>"), util.s(f, "<current:1>")]


[11/26/2023 6:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so one alternative that might work for both of us is to keep the idea of an unknown whereabout, but just have location = null for unknown whereabouts


[11/26/2023 6:43 PM] .deciusmus
That was my proposal above!


[11/26/2023 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
🙂


[11/26/2023 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
oh I thought you were saying whereabout.origin = null


[11/26/2023 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
not whereabout.origin.location = null


[11/26/2023 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
no, whereabouts.origin.location


[11/26/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
I am proposing:
(a) whereabout with no location represents the canonical "undefined" location
(b) if you want to "force" the whereabout to appear as "defined", you can set the location to something like "unknown" or "somewhere in Taelgar" or "drifting on the winds"


[11/26/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
which is a "defined-undefined"


[11/26/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
and is treated just like any other place


[11/26/2023 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
it does make the get_Whereabouts logic a little more complex but I think that is manageable


[11/26/2023 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think it makes it simpler


[11/26/2023 6:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I do not like at all needing to write " type: home, location: unknown" to force an unknown origin, though, that is just pointless extra typing


[11/26/2023 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
You introduce a "unknown" format string for each type


[11/26/2023 6:48 PM] rsulfuratus
originally I was going to propose exactly that - you have a pastKnown, pastUnknown, currentKnown, and currentUnknown for each type


[11/26/2023 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
So the idea is:

this line:

```originString = StringFormatter.getFormattedString(displayDefaults.whereaboutsOrigin, file, pageYear)```

becomes

```originString = StringFormatter.getFormattedString(origin.location? displayDefaults.whereaboutsOrigin : displayDefaults.whereaboutsOriginUnknown, file, pageYear)```


[11/26/2023 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think you need all that complexity


[11/26/2023 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
no one cares about past vs current unknown


[11/26/2023 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
Then, if you want to see "origin: unknown" you just set the display default


[11/26/2023 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
Or rather, the default display default would be Origin: Unknown, if we decided


[11/26/2023 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
whichever way


[11/26/2023 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
can you think of an example page where a) origin is unknown and b) you don't want unknown origin to be displayed?


[11/26/2023 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, we are about to eat dinner


[11/26/2023 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
i'll think about it a bit


[11/26/2023 6:50 PM] .deciusmus
No


[11/26/2023 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
treating unknown as special locations feels a bit more complicated to me but I need to think about it


[11/26/2023 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, so if we use null for unknown locations, what should happen in each of these cases:
- { type: away, location: unknown}
- { type: away, location: ""}
- { type: away, location: }
- { type: away }


[11/26/2023 7:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and I guess one could add for fun:
- {type: away, location: null }
- {type: away, location: undefined }


[11/26/2023 7:16 PM] rsulfuratus
and also, should these be treated the same or different:
- {type: home, end: 1000 }
- {type: home, location: home1 }

vs

- {type: home, start: 1001, location: home1 }


[11/26/2023 7:16 PM] rsulfuratus
(presuming born date is < 1000 or missing)


[11/26/2023 7:17 PM] .deciusmus
Location: unknown implies the string “unknown” right?


[11/26/2023 7:19 PM] .deciusmus
I think the rule is simpler than I made it sound


[11/26/2023 7:19 PM] .deciusmus
Stringformatter.getFormattedString("<current>") already returns "Unknown" if there is no current whereabout


[11/26/2023 7:19 PM] .deciusmus
so the rule for get_whereabouts is:

if (home.location == origin.location) {
     output home
} else {
    output origin
    output home
}

If (current.location != home.location) {
if (current.location == lastknown.location) {
         output current
} else i{
         output current
          output last known
}
}


[11/26/2023 7:22 PM] rsulfuratus
that is not quite right, because if current is unknown and home is unknown you still want to output current


[11/26/2023 7:22 PM] .deciusmus
right I guess you want something like:

if (home.location && home.location != current.location)


[11/26/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but this implies:
- {type: home, end: 1000, location: unknown}
for a date after 1000 with a born before 1000 will return:
output origin
output home

because unknown != null


[11/26/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but I don't think you want:


[11/26/2023 7:23 PM] .deciusmus
why?


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] rsulfuratus
there is no valid home so it is null; origin is unknown


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
if the only line is type: home, end: 1000, location: Unknown that is both the home and the origin


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, after 1000


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
if the current date is after 1000 you will get

Origin: unknown
Home: unknown


[11/26/2023 7:24 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[11/26/2023 7:25 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure that is wrong though


[11/26/2023 7:25 PM] rsulfuratus
this is why i was asking about how to process unknown locations


[11/26/2023 7:25 PM] .deciusmus
Like, why did you write the words:

"location: unknown"

instead of the shorter

"location:"


[11/26/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
that one might not be wrong, but:
- {type: home, end: 1000}

should definitely just return:
Origin: unknown

and 
- {type: home, end: 1000, location: ""}
should probably also return 
Origin: unknown


[11/26/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but null != ""


[11/26/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
and I think null != undefined but I'm not sure because java is weird


[11/26/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so you need to convert to null explicity, I think


[11/26/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
I think you are getting bogged down in the implementation


[11/26/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
What are you trying to express with

* type: home, end: 1000


[11/26/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
It seems like, in general, an odd line to ever write on its own


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
moved from somewhere to somewhere but I'm not sure where


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
grash for exampl


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] .deciusmus
It seems arbitrary to me that you prefer to see

Origin: unknown
vs
Home: unknown


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I just don't want to see both


[11/26/2023 7:28 PM] .deciusmus
but you wont


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] .deciusmus
assuming "==" is defined in a rational way


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] rsulfuratus
if one is "" and the other is null you will


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I think


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but I don't really understand java falsey-ness very well


[11/26/2023 7:29 PM] .deciusmus
but again, you are getting caught up in (a) trying to make "hard" cases and (b) implementation details


[11/26/2023 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
well I am trying to change my code to match this spec


[11/26/2023 7:30 PM] .deciusmus
it is kinda reasonable to say a couple of different things

1) we already normalize whereabouts, so it is trivial to decide that "", " ", "     ", undefined, null all equal undefined in the normalization code
2) we are not writing this code for an arbitrary set of 1000s of users, I'm not convinced there is any reason why it would be difficult to just change the location tag to location:


[11/26/2023 7:31 PM] rsulfuratus
it is one line of code


[11/26/2023 7:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but I have to make a decision about whether falsely values are considered null or not


[11/26/2023 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
Well, I would put it more simply, which is to say that any line that contains only whitespace is considered equal to any line that is contains only whitespace


[11/26/2023 7:33 PM] .deciusmus
if I didn't trust javascript I'd write it as something like

if (location == undefined ||  location == null  || location.length == 0 || location.isWhitespace()) normalizedLoc = undefined


[11/26/2023 7:34 PM] .deciusmus
but I think it is a relatively unimportant bit of logic


[11/26/2023 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
I think this is actually the right logic:

```if (whereabout.origin.location != whereabout.home.location) {
        // display origin if it is not the same as home //
        displayString += originString + "\n"    
    } 
    
    // always display home
    displayString += homeString + "\n"

    // we want to display the current location only if
    //  (a) it is different from home
    //  (b) or we don't have a home

    if (!home.location || whereabout.home.location != whereabout.current.location) {        
        displayString += currentString + "\n"
    }

    // we display the last known location only if
    //  (a) it is different from current
    //  (b) it is different from home
    //  (c) it is set (i.e. not unknown)
    if (whereabout.lastKnown.location != whereabout.current.location && 
        whereabout.lastKnown.location != whereabout.home.location &&
        whereabout.lastKnown.location) {
        displayString += knownString + "\n"
    }
```


[11/26/2023 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
The idea is that we 
(a) always show home
(b) show origin if it is not home
(c) show current if it is different from home or we don't have a home
(d) show last known if it is different from something we have already shown


[11/26/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think you can simplify (d) - I think you only ever show lastknown if current is unknown


[11/26/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
so change (a) to current is unkown


[11/26/2023 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
(and lastknown is not unknown)


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
do you want to show it if home is known?


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. a last known @ home? I guess


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, if current is unknown


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
or I guess maybe not


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure


[11/26/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think only if home is also unknown


[11/26/2023 8:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right, if home is known it implies last known = home


[11/26/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if you have

home: X, end: 1100

in 1101

I think you have

home: unknown
current: unknown
last known: X


[11/26/2023 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
but I think that is fine


[11/26/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think you show last known only if both home & current are unknown and it is known


[11/26/2023 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I think by default the whereaboutsHomeUnknown = ""


[11/26/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
Oh, I didn't bother with any of that


[11/26/2023 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't think we needed it?


[11/26/2023 8:23 PM] rsulfuratus
the use case that occurs to me is when you have an item where you want to display " Current owner: unknown"


[11/26/2023 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
isn't that going to work with current location: unknown though


[11/26/2023 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think the whereaboutsHomeUnkown, etc strings are not that useful


[11/26/2023 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think the problem is that for items, you have to treat home as special, and away as always an actual location


[11/26/2023 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., if you want an item to be "Make in: <location>", Owner: <person>", how do you do that?


[11/26/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
Do you want to distinguish between the "owner" and the "location"?


[11/26/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
the only reason I can think of to use "type: away" for items is if you want to say: this item is not with its owner


[11/26/2023 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[11/26/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe I'm overcomplicated it


[11/26/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it is, in general, fine to show:

Origin: unknown
Home: unknown
Current Location: unknown

It is rare that anyone bother's to setup whereabouts that would generate that


[11/26/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
So why not show it if you do?


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
(and actually, with the rules above, you'd never get that


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
it would just be

Origin: somewhere
home: unknown
current location: unknown


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
well, won't:
- {type: home, end: 1700, location: place}
generate that for anything after 1700?


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
your second thing


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[11/26/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
that is actually quite common in my experience


[11/26/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
really? what's the in-world example? someone you know left home but you haven't decided where they went?


[11/26/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for an item with a known maker and an unknown owner


[11/26/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
which is a decent number of items that are worth having whereabouts for


[11/26/2023 8:28 PM] rsulfuratus
that are not possessed by a member of the party


[11/26/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
it is also common for people who were born somewhere, and are now wandering


[11/26/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
which is a decent number of NPCs


[11/26/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
they would usually have subsequent away lines


[11/26/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
I am not convinced - for npcs at least - that it isn't better to just add something like

type: home, location: on the road, start: 1701


[11/26/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
then you get:

origin: somewhere
home: on the road
current location location: unknown
last known location: (somewhere or an away line)


[11/26/2023 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but the whole point is they don't have a home


[11/26/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
If I wanted across an NPC of yours, I would strongly prefer to know if you intended them to be wandering or hadn't made up a home


[11/26/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
*wandered across


[11/26/2023 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
imagine you have an NPC in Tollen you create, and what you know about them is:

* they were born in Embry
* they settled in tollen in the 1730s


[11/26/2023 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
I want the whereabouts structure to be able to express the difference between that and

* they were born in Embry
* they wandered, unsettled, without a fixed home, until the 1730s when they settled in tollen


[11/26/2023 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
The first NPC is fair game to be running an inn in Telham. The second one, probably not


[11/26/2023 8:35 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, it's all a bit edge-case


[11/26/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess in that case though I would just think you could trust the implicit unknown location


[11/26/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Eg if embry has an end date, fair game


[11/26/2023 8:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Rather of embry has an end date, then everything until the next start date is “truly unknown could be anywhere”


[11/26/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
If embry doesn’t have an end date, best to assume they moved straight from embry to Tollen


[11/26/2023 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I am just not sure why I’d want to always have to type an extra line instead of just setting an end date


[11/26/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
The way whereabouts works makes it implicit that dates on home locations have meaning


[11/26/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
The exception being people like grash or Apollyon who might have secret locations


[11/26/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
But that is a different challenge


[11/26/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not saying you should type an extra line


[11/26/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm saying you shouldn't UNLESS you want the home to be known definitely as "they didn't have a home"


[11/26/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
I'm arguing there is a difference between:

NPC X has an unknown home and
NPC X has no home


[11/26/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I think if you want to communicate a person was in a fixed location but you don’t know where, you use type = home location = unknown


[11/26/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I can’t think of anyone I’ve made up for whom that is true


[11/26/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
Sorry, I am not sure I am being clear


[11/26/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
Going back to your Tollen/embry example, the difference for me is whether the origin line has an end


[11/26/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
I don't mean "fixed location, don't know where". I mean a difference between

* I don't know what this person was doing between 1721 and 1742. They could have been having a family, they could have been adventuring, they could have been doing anything

VS

* This person left home in 1721, and wandered about for a while, mostly in greater Sembara, and they ended in 1742 in Tollen


[11/26/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
in both cases you have an end date on home 1 (Embry) of 1721 and a start date on home 2 (Tollen) of 1742


[11/26/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
The real question is, in that period, how do you show the "home" line. The options are:

Origin: Embry
Home: Unknown
Current Location: Unknown
Last Known Location (1721): Embry

VS

Origin: Embry
Current Location: Unknown
Last Known Location (1721): Embry

--

Basically, the question is, is there meaning in showing an unknown home


[11/26/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
Previously, we had declared that we don't show unknown anything except current location


[11/26/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
But now we are moving towards showing unknown origins, which is fine, but I am not sure what the argument is for unknown origins but not unknown hoes


[11/26/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
*homes


[11/26/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Ah okay, yes, in the case where I know someone left embry in 1721 and wandered with no home for a while until they settled in Tollen in 1742, I would probably explicitly set home to “unknown” or “wandering”


[11/26/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
But that is very rare edge case


[11/26/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
I don


[11/26/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
I don


[11/26/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
argh


[11/26/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think the question is about representation, exactly. Just what an "unknown" home means in display turns


[11/26/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
*terms


[11/26/2023 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I would argue a “null” home should never be displayed


[11/26/2023 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
I just don't understand why home and origin is different


[11/26/2023 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I have lots of NPCs from somewhere but who are wanderers with no current home


[11/26/2023 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
see I have lots of NPCs from "not here" but who are settled in Cleenseau with a current home 🙂


[11/26/2023 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
Eg Dee Wildcloak, Antonia/Vola arguably, Sura, Havdar arguably,


[11/26/2023 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, I agree with the origin: unknown, because it helps distinguish


[11/26/2023 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
I actually like being able to set a start on home and get Origin: unknown


[11/26/2023 8:52 PM] .deciusmus
its a quick way to distinguish natives from transplants


[11/26/2023 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
Exactly


[11/26/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
But for me at least I feel like the same logic applies to home. If I set end: xxx on an NPC in the Cleenseau orbit, I probably mean they left to settle down somewhere else


[11/26/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
it is likely the difference between a game set very heavily in one place, where it is more worthwhile to have details about dozens of minor NPCs, so the PCs keep running into the same people and they develop a bit of versimilitude vs a travelling ame


[11/26/2023 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
But you will have a current location in that case


[11/26/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't decided where they have left for


[11/26/2023 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Current location unknown then


[11/26/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, but I like seeing Home: unknown as well


[11/26/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
is my argument


[11/26/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure I care too much, honestly


[11/26/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
I don't want to make the code more complicated


[11/26/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
But if you don't like the "home: unknown" I'm happy to set the home to never show if null


[11/26/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess to me:
Origin: Clee
Current Location: Unknown

Is pretty clearly a person who left for parts unknown


[11/26/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
in that case I can always add a 

type: home, location: somewhere east of Clee


[11/26/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
But this is why I was working on having unknown and known display strings


[11/26/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
Then it is just a question of defaults


[11/26/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
Well, yes, the real solution is that 🙂


[11/26/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
but it seemed more complicated than it was worth


[11/26/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I have it nearly working in my branch


[11/26/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
although this 40 minutes of mostly pointless back and forth argues otherwise 🙂


[11/26/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
It is not hard


[11/26/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the only ones you car about are home and origin


[11/26/2023 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
Home is the only one that needs 4 display strings


[11/26/2023 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
sure, I mean if you end up deleting whereaboutsUnknown and adding whereaboutsOriginUnknown, whereaboutsHomeUnknown, and whereaboutsCurrentUnknown


[11/26/2023 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
and current, although logically that is the existing whereaboutsUnknown


[11/26/2023 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
which is not used anymore


[11/26/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think you need 4 for home even


[11/26/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
I guess you need the dead unknown to avoid a special case of blank


[11/26/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
but I can't imagine a scenario where you'd want it anything other than blank


[11/26/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
so you will have:

whereaboutsOriginUnknown
whereaboutsHomePastUnknown
whereaboutsHomeUnknown
whereaboutsCurrentUnknown


[11/26/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
?


[11/26/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
I presume last known is never shown if it is unknown, that doesn't make sense


[11/26/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a fix to stringmanager to your branch


[11/26/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
we should always display origin if it is unknown


[11/26/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
I also pushed the ! stuff


[11/26/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
if the format string has ! we use it, not the whereabout format


[11/26/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed some more updates


[11/26/2023 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
going to clean up setting default displayDefaults and then go to bed


[11/27/2023 9:16 AM] rsulfuratus
mostly working today but currently moving on to try to understand location manager. one question: should we treat commas as legacy/backwards compatibility, or should we make it possible for something like "wandering, north of Tokra" to work equivalently to "wandering north of Tokra"? e.g., if I understand code correctly, LocationManager.isInLocation with a targetLocation of Dunmar will return false for first one (with comma), true for second (w/o comma).

my inclination is either:
(a) leave things as they are, and treat commas as special, often with unexpected behavior - just don't use them unless you want to turn off location chain building for some reason
(b) ignore commas entirely, just check if string matches something, if not look for first capital. this will mean that "Karawa, Eastern Dunmar" will be considered a data entry error and (should) turn into "Karawa, Eastern Dunmar, Eastern Dunmar, Dunmar"

I would mildly prefer (b) for simplicity, since you can always turn off location chaining with format: F anyway, but I'm not sure it really matters that much

I haven't written the find capital letter function in Python yet, but planning on designing it as a function that takes a string and returns the position of the first capital letter. then I'd have the note lookup function take a string and checks, in order: 1) if the string exists as a file; 2) if the string exists as an alias; 3) if the string starting from the index of the first capital exists as a file; 4) if the string starting from the first capital exists as an alias. 

In python the linking stuff doesn't matter, there is no reason to ever link a file that doesn't exist for the website, so that part is a lot simpler and we never use the link always type.


[11/27/2023 9:35 AM] .deciusmus
I would be happy to ignore commas


[11/27/2023 9:35 AM] .deciusmus
Makes the code simpler


[11/27/2023 9:36 AM] .deciusmus
But there are a lot of whereabouts today still with old-style data, ie

Kawara, Eastern Dunmar
Rather than just Karawa


[11/27/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
I’m pretty sure my capital letter code ignores the first capital letter (to avoid infinite loops) so Kawara, Dunmar would be treated the same as wandering in Dunmar


[11/27/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
ie only Dunmar would be linked


[11/27/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
And inLocation only believes the person is in Dunmar, not Karawa


[11/27/2023 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/27/2023 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
It might be better to in general ignore “old stuff” and just fix the data though


[11/27/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
there are 102 people with commas in location, would take 20 minutes to fix, i'd ignore


[11/27/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
table whereabouts.location as Loc from "People" where contains(whereabouts.location, ",")


[11/27/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
i am in general in favor of ignoring backwards compatibilty if it requires more than few lines of code to maintain


[11/27/2023 9:46 AM] .deciusmus
do you want to merge your code_cleanup branch, btw?


[11/27/2023 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
i can. i am slowly working through all the code to make sure i understand it and simplify if possible, since i am finding it very hard to maintain the python code without actually understanding what the java functions do


[11/27/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
I can also just commit changes there


[11/27/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
if that is easier


[11/27/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
we should really make the _scripts directory its own repo and make it a submodule of taelgar


[11/27/2023 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
I have 13 minutes until my next meeting and I was going to
(a) fix the bug where Origin: unknown sometimes doesn't show
(b) introduce slices, i.e. 2-6 meaning parts 2-6 of the depth tree


[11/27/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
great


[11/27/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess commit to code_cleanup for now


[11/27/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm looking at location manager for next 13 minutes then also have a meeting


[11/27/2023 9:49 AM] .deciusmus
did you implement the "unknown" strings for whereabouts


[11/27/2023 9:50 AM] .deciusmus
I don't see it in the code


[11/27/2023 9:50 AM] rsulfuratus
it is in metadata.json


[11/27/2023 9:50 AM] rsulfuratus
and get_whereabouts


[11/27/2023 9:50 AM] .deciusmus
ah, I see


[11/27/2023 9:50 AM] .deciusmus
there just isn't one for current


[11/27/2023 9:50 AM] .deciusmus
I didn't scroll up enough


[11/27/2023 9:51 AM] rsulfuratus
right, i didn't think you needed a different string for current unknown


[11/27/2023 9:51 AM] rsulfuratus
but could add it, not difficult


[11/27/2023 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
i agree


[11/27/2023 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
just didn't look carefully enough


[11/27/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
thinking about name processing, i wonder if it is worth having a "standardized name" object, like we have standardized whereabout and standardized date. that could simplify a lot of stuff


[11/27/2023 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
a standardized name would take any string, and return an object with:
- bare text: input string
- file: the file associated with the string, if any
- prefix: the text before the file
- suffix: the text after the file (for now always "")
- alias: the link text, if different from file
- frontmatter: the file metadata
- article: the article
- displayName: the computed descriptive name, e.g. "title name" for people, etc


[11/27/2023 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
possibly other things as well would be useful


[11/27/2023 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
that could simplify a ton of stuff, we stick all the normalization code into a normalizeName function


[11/27/2023 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
and then any kind of lookup can always rely on normalizedName.file as either a) pointing to a real file or b) being null if there is no file


[11/27/2023 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
that would simplify anything like isInLocation, and would make it a lot easier to tweak name processing if we want to in the future (e.g. to allow "sailing between Western Gulf ports" to auto-link to Western Gulf)


[11/27/2023 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
or to change how auto-linking works, e.g. only allow dangling links to proper names


[11/27/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/27/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
it definitely makes sense


[11/27/2023 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
i have half an hour before my next meeting I might make a preliminary attempt at this


[11/27/2023 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to push a location manager cleanup


[11/27/2023 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
(1) supports formats like 2-4r meaning, start at the 2nd location, go until the 4th, exclude regions
(2) removes special casing of commas. Comma strings are treating like regular strings, so Place Name, RegionName is treated like RegionName for matching purposes


[11/27/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
great


[11/27/2023 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
In strings like "trapped in Stormcaller Tower", the filter doesn't apply to the "trapped in" part


[11/27/2023 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. that will always appear


[11/27/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
so if you have "trapped in Stormcaller Tower", format: "2-4" you will get

trapped in Eastern Dunmar, Dunmar, the Central Lowlands Region


[11/27/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
I think that is correct


[11/27/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
But if it isn't, it is too much of  pain to fix in the next few minutes, so we should just log a bug


[11/27/2023 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is correct, but this is what the normalized name would handle anyway, so if we want to change that behavior it should be wrapped into the normalized name handling


[11/27/2023 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, true


[11/27/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
the other slight oddity is I'm making no attempt to handle blanks


[11/27/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if you set a format like "Rr" (to exclude regions and also make only regions" you are going to end up with

Based in:


[11/27/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. a blank


[11/27/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't somehow determine thats an "unknown location"


[11/27/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
which, also,  I think is correct


[11/27/2023 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is not an unknown location, it is a undisplayed location


[11/27/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
it would be pretty easy to have it display something like

(location hidden) or (location filtered out)


[11/27/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure the benefit other than to help understand the filter is busted


[11/27/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
theoretically that would be useful for secret locations for website export


[11/27/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
but we don't support an alternative format for export only, so it doesn't really help much


[11/27/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/27/2023 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, architecturally, it would be pretty trivial to allow for exportDisplaySettings in the yaml


[11/27/2023 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
you could change it right before you export and then change it back if you really cared


[11/27/2023 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
exportDisplaySettings would also be easy


[11/27/2023 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
It wouldn't quite work though


[11/27/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
you'd need an export format for whereabouts lines


[11/27/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
The only realistic use case is for a campaign I am not in, because otherwise you can't really push the secrets to git anyway


[11/27/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
for secrets, yes


[11/27/2023 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
until I figure out a way to add secret filtering to yaml without breaking stuff


[11/27/2023 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
And realistically, I'd be inclined to do something like:

exportDisplaySettings: { whereaboutsCurrent: "Unknown" }

rather than trying to control it at the specific whereabout line. Although I guess having a exportFormat for whereabouts would be easier


[11/27/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the real use case is if you like having long location chains in obsidian but prefer short ones in the website, or vice versa


[11/27/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is a pretty low priority feature IMO


[11/27/2023 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
I can actually see the benefit of the export feature for secrets management


[11/27/2023 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah it would also be useful for secrets management for your campaign


[11/27/2023 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. when my game gets to the point where the players are trying to figure out where someone is, and I want to be tracking their location via whereabouts (for note-takening convinence), I could just tag a whereabout line as "exportFormat: rR" so that it filters to nothing


[11/27/2023 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
and would display as (location filtered) or something


[11/27/2023 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
it would actually be fairly trivial, your python code would just have to do the equivalent of:

whereaboutsFormat = w.exportFormat ?? w.format


[11/27/2023 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
and that's it


[11/27/2023 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
i haven't written any string formatting in python and don't plan to until i have time to understand the string formatter class, but yes it will be very easy to implement at the whereabouts level for secret whereabouts


[11/27/2023 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
and actually should be fairly trivial at the displayDefaults level as well


[11/27/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, a wee bit harder if you want to merge


[11/27/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
but not really


[11/27/2023 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
merging dicts in python is pretty easy via the magic of list comprehesion, I think easier than merging javascript objects


[11/27/2023 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
One last bit before I go back to work:

dealing with "Taelgar".

Currently
(a) it doesn't auto-link
(b) it is special cased to always return "" when being handled in a location chain

(b) is to prevent

[11/27/2023 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, (b) makes sense, but it creates a minorly annoying bug that the string: "floating across Taelgar" becomes "floating across"


[11/27/2023 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
low priority to fix and might be better handled by a normalized name


[11/27/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
it was something the comma was handling


[11/27/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. on the Hralgar page, "drifting on the storm, Taelgar" worked because we didn't check anything with commas


[11/27/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
having removed the comma code, it is now "drifting on the storm"


[11/27/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
one simple fix is to include taelgar only if the current depth is 1 or 2


[11/27/2023 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
and also if regions are included


[11/27/2023 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
that actually works pretty nicely


[11/27/2023 1:24 PM] .deciusmus

I think it feels about right. You can always set format:1 on the dunmar layer if you don't want it to show taelgar

merging pr. will start a new branch for normalized name refactor to avoid messing things up while in flight

{Reactions}
👍

[11/27/2023 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
so occurs to me looking at your commits that a nice side benefit is places can change home now, so e.g. Drankor can report as part of the Drankorian Empire prior to 1059 and something else after


[11/27/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
that is true


[11/27/2023 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is probably better not to enforce a strict system on this and see how we feel like using it


[11/27/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is still a topic to sort out around how the difference between a place and a polity


[11/27/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
but I wanted to just let that develop


[11/27/2023 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i mean conceptually home vs away could map to "physical location" vs "political location"


[11/27/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
or, alternatively, partOf could map to political location


[11/27/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
or affiliations


[11/27/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure what is correct


[11/27/2023 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, me neither. also a bit tricky for location chains - if there is a physical and political location which do you follow?


[11/27/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno.. if you were looking at a page on a village in Western Cymea what do you want to see?


[11/27/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
or a page on Insingue in 1502


[11/27/2023 3:22 PM] .deciusmus
or even, say Drankor


[11/27/2023 3:22 PM] .deciusmus
in 1748, the page on Drankor should say what?


[11/27/2023 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I think generally i'd prefer to see political affialiations


[11/27/2023 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. in 1748 Drankor should be Drankor, Desolation of Cha'mutte


[11/27/2023 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
or something like


[11/27/2023 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
right, that is just a dated "home" for Drankor though


[11/27/2023 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but of course a place like Drankor is not part of any larger physical region


[11/27/2023 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
which works nicely for places that logically "moved"


[11/27/2023 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
there are very few places actually that are contained both within a meaningful political designation and a meaningful physical designation


[11/27/2023 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
just because we usually haven't bothered naming geographic regions independently of politics


[11/27/2023 3:25 PM] rsulfuratus
or we've left them pretty ambiguous, like Cymea


[11/27/2023 3:25 PM] rsulfuratus
so it might not matter


[11/27/2023 3:25 PM] .deciusmus
a great way to deal with places like Drankor would be origin + home with dated whereabouts actually

a ruin in the Desoluation of Cha'mutte
was part of the Drankorian Empire


[11/27/2023 3:25 PM] .deciusmus
Well, the same is true on earth. The french Alps is in France, not some other region name


[11/27/2023 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is mostly relevant for ruins actually and origin + home is a nice option there


[11/27/2023 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. I might want Stormcaller Tower to display as "a tower in Central Dunmar"; "originally built as part of Alcarinque" or something like that


[11/27/2023 3:27 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/27/2023 3:27 PM] .deciusmus
it actually works very well for ruins


[11/27/2023 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
or the dwarven outpost, "A ruined trading post in the Sentinel Range. Built (date if known) as part of Ardith"


[11/27/2023 3:27 PM] .deciusmus
the murkier area is conquests and colonies


[11/27/2023 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
Because I think that is the only place where the distinction actually matters


[11/27/2023 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. the difference between "Sembara" (the country) and "Sembara" (the place) is not worth making. Same for Dunmar


[11/27/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
that is where you need ruledBy:
"A city in Western Cymean, Cymean Peninsula"
"Ruled by Tollen"


[11/27/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
probably best as an affiliation type


[11/27/2023 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
but if war breaks out between Chardon and Dunmar and Songara is conqueored by Chardon, you'd really like to be able to reflect that somehow


[11/27/2023 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
as distinct from its physical location in western Dunmar


[11/27/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
i think probably the best model is a ruledBy/partOf affiliation. the display is similar to leader of


[11/27/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
and affiliations are also naturally dated


[11/27/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
so if Songara is conquered by Chardon, it can have a dated affiliation with a ruledBy type, so the line just doesn't show prior to that date


[11/27/2023 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/27/2023 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
you might not even really need a special affiliation type since affiliations are grouped by title and if you set the title to Ruled by it should work with just default member


[11/27/2023 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
It might be simpler to code/think about as a type: leader on Chardon though


[11/27/2023 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
but that gets back to the problem of having to edit a different page to change information about songara, which is very messy


[11/27/2023 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
and also you don't want the information displaying on the Chardonian Empire page


[11/27/2023 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
The challenge is, I think, that I want to add a 

get_RuledBy()

to the header, so I can have a nice little block in the front of Sembara that tells you who the current ruler is


[11/27/2023 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
it seems quite useful, and lets you do cool things like have the page for The Crossroads Inn just show the current proprietor


[11/27/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
The problem is if you can define it both ways, who wins?


[11/27/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
Do you just merge? What if the inn page says "ruledBy: X" and the page for Y says "leaderOf: inn"


[11/27/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
having two places to define the same thing gets messy really fast


[11/27/2023 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
I'm also not convinced that the page you are on is so fixed as that


[11/27/2023 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i would just merge and display both if they are different. if that is wrong, you'll see and can fix it


[11/27/2023 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
Imagine I'm filling out the page for the Republic of Auzbez and I make up the fact that they conqueored a bunch of small independent frontier towns. I just set it on the auzbez page


[11/27/2023 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah you should be able to set it on either page


[11/27/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
Fair enough. But for the moment, if I do anything, it would be to add a "get ruled by" logic to the get affiliations


[11/27/2023 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
say chardon and dunmar go to war and over the next 3 months chardon slowly conquers places. i don't want the chardonian empire frontmatter to be 20 lines long


[11/27/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
so that Sembara page shows the current ruler


[11/27/2023 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
that's fine


[11/27/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
that doesn't prevent us adding the back-linking, but it means someone needs to code it


[11/27/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
and the leader -> place will work


[11/27/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i am not likely to think much about new features for a while, my current goal is to just get through the existing code and then support string formatting properly in export, with the option of export-specific formats


[11/27/2023 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
not likely to touch affiliation code until i'm happy with the string formatting on export, at least


[11/27/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
For affiliations I am trying to add a format override but to keep it simple... do you think it is reasonable to say:

format -> if specified use else if

formatPast & formatCurrent are specified, use the past for past and the current for current?


[11/27/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
You will know whether you have dates or not


[11/27/2023 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
but you don't know if you are past or current


[11/27/2023 3:52 PM] .deciusmus

[11/27/2023 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but doesn't that imply that Dunmar is leader of Cleenseau despite text saying Cleenseau conqurerored Dunmar?


[11/27/2023 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
yeah by text was backwards


[11/27/2023 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
it should say Conqueored


[11/27/2023 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
not conqueored by


[11/27/2023 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
re: format, I would like to generalize basically everything that has more than one line to be able to set the display string for just that entry. so for example if you set "whereaboutsPastHome" on a specific whereabouts line it uses that display string if it is PastHome only. would be the same logic with affliations, e.g. set affiliationPast specifically or whatever


[11/27/2023 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
it is not obvious to me at the moment how to make that would but I think that is the ideal option. i'd really like to be able to override whereaboutsParty for specific campaignInfo lines, for example


[11/27/2023 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
well here is the real use case of the above:

right, i don't think you want to have to type affiliationNoDate if you provide a format string for an affiliation without a date, because there is only one thing it could be


[11/27/2023 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
same for whereaboutsParty, you just want format although there you have to deconvolute whether it is a format string for <current:> or a whole thing


[11/27/2023 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
I think for whereabouts you need to say what it is


[11/27/2023 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
right

[11/27/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
so that gets awkward because what if person X dies, then it stays living aboard


[11/27/2023 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
no it doesn;t

[11/27/2023 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay, homeFormat = whereaboutsHome then, sure

[11/27/2023 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but why not just use whereaboutsHome?


[11/27/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
so many letters


[11/27/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
well I think we should make the displayDefaults shorter then


[11/27/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd be happy to go clean up the code to do that


[11/27/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
sure, that works


[11/27/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
it will be super annoying to have to remember two different format naming schemes when there are so many


[11/27/2023 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
that is fair enough


[11/27/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
"current" is awkard because it clashes with pageCurrent


[11/27/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
probably actually the structure should be:

displayDefaults: { whereabouts: { home:, pastHome:, etc }, ... rest of stuff }


[11/27/2023 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't like nested objects like that, i think it will be easier to remember if we just use short letter codes


[11/27/2023 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g.
wHome
wHomePast
wHomeUnk
wHomePastUnk


[11/27/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[11/27/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
that works as well


[11/27/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
w = whereabouts, a = affiliiations, d = page dates (or p for page)


[11/27/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
but this is messy to me:

[11/27/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
I like d


[11/27/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
you mean wHome instead of Home?


[11/27/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
I think homeFormat is best


[11/27/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
inside the whereabout, "home" is not clearly a format


[11/27/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, I guess it doesn't matter a ton


[11/27/2023 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
normalize whereabouts can fix that


[11/27/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
well, yes, in the code clearly normalize can change home -> homeFormat


[11/27/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
do you want to just type { home: } and remember it means the home format


[11/27/2023 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I just really really don't want to have to remember different string codes. so whatever aliases work, you should be able to always pass the same string code via a whereabouts line


[11/27/2023 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
it should be wHome, not home


[11/27/2023 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if displayDefaults has wHome, wHomePast, then wHome and wHomePast should work in a whereabouts line too


[11/27/2023 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
homeFormat is confusing to me because does that mean past or current?


[11/27/2023 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
same with plain home


[11/27/2023 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
that's what we have in display defaults right now


[11/27/2023 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
we have home and pastHome, current and past


[11/27/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
ah i see you are just stripping the w from the front


[11/27/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i would prefer *wHome* to just *home*


[11/27/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
because it standardized format string vocab


[11/27/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
welll I wrote it to work with wHome, home, and homeFormat


[11/27/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
🙂


[11/27/2023 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
sure as I said I don't care what aliases exist as long as you can alway use whatever is in displayDefaults as well

[11/27/2023 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
that is awesome


[11/27/2023 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd propose:
```
"startStatus" -> 
"endStatus" -> 
"whereaboutsOrigin" -> wOrigin
"whereaboutsOriginUnknown" -> wOriginU
"whereaboutsHome" -> wHome
"whereaboutsHomeUnknown" -> wHomeU
"whereaboutsPastHome": -> wPastHome
"whereaboutsPastHomeUnknown" -> wPastHomeU
"whereaboutsCurrent" -> wCurrent
"whereaboutsPast" -> wPast
"whereaboutsLastKnown" -> wLast
"whereaboutsLastKnownNoDate" -> wLastU
"whereaboutsUnknown": no longer used, I think
"whereaboutsParty": -> wParty
"pageCurrent": -> dCurrent
"pagePastWithStart" -> dPastStart
"pagePast": -> dPast
"boxName": -> boxName
"partOf":  -> partOf
"secondaryInfo": -> boxInfo
"affiliationNoDate": -> aNoDate
"affiliationPast": -> aPast
"affiliationCurrent": -> aCurrent
"affiliationPastWithStart": -> aPastStart
"ddbLinkText": -> linkText
"definitiveArticle" -> Article
```


[11/27/2023 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
Article could just be Art or art or article


[11/27/2023 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure about startStatus and endStatus


[11/27/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
I'd leave start and end status


[11/27/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
they match the format strings


[11/27/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
I'd make article defArt


[11/27/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
right and we also have `<start> and <end>` for dates


[11/27/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
we might want to add indefArt at some point


[11/27/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I'd also add indefiniteArticle (inArt) which


[11/27/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/27/2023 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
would be nice for those A university things


[11/27/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/27/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
although only works if you add a page for "university"


[11/27/2023 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
the whereabouts unknown can be deleted


[11/27/2023 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
wLastU should be wLastNoDate


[11/27/2023 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
and I think I might makeit wLastKnown


[11/27/2023 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
ha oops that was copilot tab completion on wLastU, kind of funny


[11/27/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
slightly more to type but again, it aligns with "<lastknown>" in the format strings themselves


[11/27/2023 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
still keeps everyhing 10 characters or less


[11/27/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
also I would do PastWithStart not PastStart


[11/27/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
PastStart is confusing, that sounds like we use it when we are past the start


[11/27/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
but actually it is used for in-the-past with a start date


[11/27/2023 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
dPastHasStart


[11/27/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/27/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
perfect


[11/27/2023 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
will also use: "affiliationPastWithStart": -> aPastHasStart

I am going to attempt to fix all the displayDefault names now. if you have any in flight changes you don't want to deal with merging push them now


[11/27/2023 5:05 PM] rsulfuratus
unless you are already doing this


[11/27/2023 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
we have rather inconsistent naming, the results of NameManager.getDisplayData is called:
- displayOptions
- displayData
- displayDefaults
- pageDisplayData


[11/27/2023 5:31 PM] .deciusmus
I don’t have anything relevant in flight. AFK for a while

[11/27/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus

[11/27/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
with definitiveArticle instead of defArt and such

{Reactions}
👍

[11/27/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think it should just be art not defARt


[11/27/2023 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
if you have a page that should be "a phasing stone" just set the art to "a" instead of "the"


[11/27/2023 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah probably, since I don't think we'd use indefArt


[11/27/2023 8:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/27/2023 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
pretty trivial to replace defArt with art with a unix one-liner if we want


[11/27/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
I added a Bad Data page


[11/27/2023 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
with a collection of dataview queries for various older ways of doing things


[11/27/2023 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i tried to clean up the _MOC content. i moved "useful query" type pages to top-level (with the test case)


[11/27/2023 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
also moved anything that didn't seem current to old


[11/27/2023 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I see you also cleaned stuff, I may have restored some files you deleted


[11/27/2023 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
feel free to re-delete anything in old


[11/27/2023 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
still left to write for _MOC stuff is an update on how strings are parsed into names and links but waiting on normalize name refactor for taht

the code is just this:

```dataviewjs
const { util } = customJS
dv.table(["Person", "Info", "Current Location"], 
            dv.pages("#person")
                .where(f => util.isAffiliated(dv.current().file.name, f.file))
                .map(b => [util.s("<name> (<pronouns> <pronunciation>)", b.file, dv.current().pageTargetDate), util.s("<ancestry> <maintype>", b.file, dv.current().pageTargetDate), util.s("<lastknown:2r> (<lastknowndate>)", b.file, dv.current().pageTargetDate)]))
```


[11/27/2023 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
this reveals a bit of a headache with vehicle locations - would prefer to see the last known location of the Wave Dancer in the first one, but that is a bit trickier


[11/27/2023 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
so it is really easily to change


[11/27/2023 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
you don't get a last known for the person since current is valid


[11/27/2023 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but the location chain stops since the current location is unknown of the wave dancer


[11/27/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
it works

[11/27/2023 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
the issue is that the Wave Dancer has no home


[11/27/2023 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
I guess the issue is that we don't pick up the last known of the wave dancer


[11/27/2023 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah what is the code you are using to generate that?


[11/27/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
util.s("<name> (<pronouns> <pronunciation>)")


[11/27/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
is just a simplified shorthand for calling stringformatter.getFormattedString


[11/27/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
no I meant how are you getting last known of wave dancer in the table?


[11/27/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
I changed the date


[11/27/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
the pageTargetDate


[11/27/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
so that it is the current not the last known


[11/27/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[11/27/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
it only works if the wave dancer has a current date


[11/27/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. it does follow current correctly, but it won't jump backwards to the last known


[11/27/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes, that was my point


[11/27/2023 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure there is a simple solution


[11/27/2023 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
you would have to allow the inLocation to return a date


[11/27/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, technically it is quite easy to just follow the last known instead of the current


[11/27/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
actually, it would be really easy


[11/27/2023 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
following last known would be easy


[11/27/2023 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but managing the date would not


[11/27/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
it is


[11/27/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
because the date is its own thing


[11/27/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
it works only for string formats


[11/27/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
but <lastknowndate> can generate the right thing


[11/27/2023 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
no, i mean that I think you don't want to just always follow last known


[11/27/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
just need a new API on location manager to get the "oldest" date in a chain


[11/27/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
generally speaking, the correct behavior is to follow current


[11/27/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
and terminate when you hit unknown


[11/27/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
realistically, you probably want a better way to have location containers


[11/27/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is only when you are generating the last known whereabout that you want to follow last known


[11/27/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/27/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is tricky because getLocationFromPartOfs needs to know if it is generating a lastknown or something else


[11/27/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
more specifically, when you are getting the location chain for the <lastknown> format string


[11/27/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[11/27/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
its just a bool input


[11/27/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
allowFollowLastKnown


[11/27/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
that string formatter passes when it is generating a <lastknown>


[11/27/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
then you need a getOldestKnownDateInChain


[11/27/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
which will walk the chain with the same logic


[11/27/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
or something


[11/27/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
don't feel like solving it tonight but it isn't that hard


[11/27/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the location chains are getting a little complex here. these kinds of things that just have a ton of little bools passed through three functions are really tricky to keep in sync across python and java


[11/27/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
true


[11/27/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
this is why I want a normalized name because it is much easier to check an object property than pass lots of bools


[11/27/2023 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
here is a nice one:

[11/27/2023 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but actually,  this would be a nice use of export formats


[11/27/2023 11:04 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[11/27/2023 11:05 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a bunch of templates btw


[11/27/2023 11:05 PM] .deciusmus
for making nice little tables


[11/27/2023 11:06 PM] .deciusmus
They are:

cities-in
members-of-org
members-of-org-historical (includes dead members)
people-in-or-based-in (only living people, home or last known in the page)
places-in 
relationships-of (includes dead people, with an isAlive column)


[11/27/2023 11:09 PM] rsulfuratus
just saw that


[11/27/2023 11:10 PM] rsulfuratus
how do you sort these?


[11/27/2023 11:13 PM] rsulfuratus
nvm got it, just need sort before map which I didn't realize


[11/27/2023 11:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm just going to start keeping delwath up to date with the world by adding:
`{campaign: DuFr, person: Delwath, date: 1748-12-27, type: scryed}` to randompeople


[11/27/2023 11:39 PM] rsulfuratus

[11/28/2023 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
We should define a bit of standardization on typeOf/subTypeOf/ancestry for places


[11/28/2023 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
Just to follow up on this, I spent a bit of time looking at how we are using typeOf / etc today on items + places, and I think we are missing a feature.

I propose the following update.

(a) typeOf - this should be a relatively well defined, relatively limited set of values intended to support data queries
(b) typeOfAlias - newly introduced. This is used in display strings as an alias for typeOf and can be used when you want to change how the type is described. Never meaningful in data queries.
(c) subTypeOf - an adjective or descriptive noun (ruined, abandoned, forest, manor, etc) that helps clarify what the thing is. Might be sometimes uses in searches, and particularly useful when you want to characterize something as two things (i.e. forest realm or section of road)
(d) ancestry - always used to describe the kind of people who live in or lived in a place


[11/28/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
Examples:

Lakan Monastery:
From:
```{ typeOf: monastery }```
to 
``` { typeOf: holy site, typeOfAlias: monastery, ancestry: Dunmari, subTypeOf: Laka }```

Akela Inn
From:
```{ typeOf: inn, subTypeOf: caravanserai }```
To
``` { typeOf: inn, typeOfAlias: caravanserai, ancestry: Dunmari }```


Dunmari Fort (Gomat)
From:
```{typeOf: fort, ancestry: ruined }```

To

```{typeOf: fort, ancestry: Dunmari, subTypeOf: ruined }```


Stormcaller Tower
From:
```{typeOf: ruin }```

To

```{typeOf: fort, typeOfAlias: tower, subTypeOf: ruined }```


[11/28/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
The standard display string then becomes:

<ancestry> <subTypeOf> <typeOfAlias??typeOf>


[11/28/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
And we can avoid having to override the wHome for places that want to use a different display name for the type of


[11/28/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
This would also help with cities.. For example, we could change all towns / villages / hamlets / cities to be typeOf: settlement, typeOfAlias: <whatever>


[11/28/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
The ultimate goal here is to make queries easier, i.e. make it a lot more straightforward to get a list of all inns, all ruined places, all settlements, etc


[11/28/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
The same logic can apply to items, i.e. for vehicles where you want the typeOf to be vehicle but for it to display as "caravan" or "skyship" or "boat"


[11/28/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
This would also make it easier to start having specific behaviors for certain types of pages, i.e. having the whereabouts logic work differently if a page is a vehicle


[11/28/2023 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, dated wherabouts for places works great


[11/28/2023 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this sounds reasonable, I am quite busy at work for the next few weeks and have to write a session for Thursday so realistically not going to probably think about Obsidian related stuff until the weekend, but I think this is a good change. i might quibble about some details but that is fine to revise later. once we have a bunch of stuff with typeOf: fort it is easier to go back and see if some things don't belong


[11/28/2023 6:54 PM] rsulfuratus
stub for the Deno'qai godcaller is already in obsidian, jotha, feel free to change gender if you want


[11/28/2023 7:15 PM] rsulfuratus
I think take the orcs too if you want


[11/28/2023 7:17 PM] .deciusmus
We also need a gardener


[11/28/2023 7:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I have an elf gardener


[11/28/2023 7:18 PM] .deciusmus
Technically the garden and the greenhouse both have a tender


[11/28/2023 7:18 PM] .deciusmus
Although we don’t need to fully staff stuff obvs


[11/28/2023 7:19 PM] rsulfuratus
You flesh out elf instead of orcs if you want


[11/28/2023 7:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think ship would be crowded if everything is fully staffed o assume most people do two jobs, plus you all


[11/28/2023 7:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I think orcs should probably be one librarian type and one brawler / fighter type


[11/28/2023 7:23 PM] .deciusmus
I’ll do the orcs. Was just thinking we could use a lizardfolk for completeness


[11/28/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
Ha yeah eventually you need a lizardfolk and a stoneborn and some interesting fey…


[11/28/2023 7:27 PM] .deciusmus
Also if we are getting level 13 stuff we should at least have a archive and a mediation chamber. Maybe we at least need an archivist of some sort


[11/28/2023 7:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i was thinking one of the orcs could be an archivist


[11/28/2023 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
actually i had an idea for one of the orcs, maybe it makes more sense for them not to be twin sisters


[11/28/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
I like the orcs as twin sisters, but haven't started making them up


[11/28/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
I'm trying to organize our rooms


[11/28/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
what's the elf's name again?


[11/28/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
Égnir (he/him, AY-nyeer)


[11/28/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
not yet in obisidian?


[11/28/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
sure stick with twin sisters


[11/28/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
I'm making a page for our rooms


[11/28/2023 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
our to-be state of our rooms


[11/28/2023 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
just made a page, will push


[11/28/2023 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
my idea for the orc was an archivist/lore master,  who has been gathering records and rumors of other free orcs for a while and now wants to look for rumors in the outside world. could function as archivist easily and run the archive


[11/28/2023 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
but could definifitely stick w/ twin sisters


[11/28/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
here is what I have so far:

Upper Deck:

* the shrine to the [[Tanshi|tanshi]], tended by [[Jotha]] 
* the elven garden and greenhouse, tended by [[Egnir]]
* the elven tree, grown from seed by [[Kenzo]]
* the main building on the upper deck, which contains a lavish dining hall, space for conversation and relaxation, the living quarters of [[Kenzo]], [[Delwath]], [[Riswynn]], [[Seeker]], [[Wellby]], and the map room, tended by ~kenku scout~ and ~mapmaker~
* the courtyard bow-ward of the main building, and the decking and railings around the main building, which is decorating with memorials to the adventures of the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] and tended by [[Kenzo]] and [[Amil]]


[11/28/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
Lower Deck:

* [[Seeker|Seeker's]] game room
* [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak's]] workshop
* the archives and research library, tended by ~tbd~
* the smithy, tended by ~smith~


[11/28/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
Storage Deck:

* [[Baxter|Baxter's]] accomodations and stable area
* a storage hold


[11/28/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
Gamewise that would be:

* Sanctury   (5)
* Garden (5) & Greenhouse (9)
* Meditation Room (13)
* Library (5)
* Trophy Room (9)
* Training Area (9)
* Workshop (5)
* Archive (13)
* Smithy (5)
* Stable (9)
* Storehouse (5)


[11/28/2023 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
Eric wants an observatory


[11/28/2023 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to say we need to add an observatory somewhere


[11/28/2023 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
and a second training hall, probably


[11/28/2023 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
that's 14 special facilities total


[11/28/2023 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
I was calcuating the space, pretty sure it all fits fine but was going to double check


[11/28/2023 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
kate also wants a dwarven shrine


[11/28/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
yeah she should have a sanctum


[11/28/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
or a reliquary


[11/28/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
or both


[11/28/2023 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
reliquary is super useful from a game point of view since it gets you material components for hero's feast 1/week for free


[11/28/2023 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
sanctum is level 17


[11/28/2023 8:52 PM] .deciusmus
right I meant sacristry


[11/28/2023 8:52 PM] .deciusmus
But let's say we add:

* observatory on upper deck


[11/28/2023 8:52 PM] .deciusmus
that probably fills up the upper deck


[11/28/2023 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/28/2023 8:52 PM] .deciusmus
Reliquary down by the smithy


[11/28/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
although actually the upper deck is only ~250 squares, even including 128squares for a roomy parlor, kitchen, dinining + living quarters x5


[11/28/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, 200 x 80 is a lot of square footage.


[11/28/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
but also the courtyard and tree is probably a vast facility


[11/28/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
(36 squares)


[11/28/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
I guess the garden should be vast


[11/28/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
and the greenhouse vast


[11/28/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
I gave garden + greenhouse = 52 squares


[11/28/2023 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd count them each as vast, which gives you two garden options. the vast greenhouse is just flavor to give space for the tree


[11/28/2023 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
but still probably have space for a few more things on the top deck to be added later


[11/28/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
I made the meditation chamber vast and indicated that it also counted as a vast courtyard

{Reactions}
👍

[11/28/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
so it takes 40 squares


[11/28/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
Garden and Greenhouse are also both  vast


[11/28/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
312 squares used on top floor


[11/28/2023 9:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd say maybe 408 usable on top floor so still room for a bit more later


[11/28/2023 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
btw, totally separately, I was looking at the D&D Playtest stuff. Monks and Rogues have a lot of cool things I was going to see if Schwartz and Kong want. most of the warlock stuff is about making pact of the blade viable for non-hexblades and i think not worth the trouble of reworking your entire character, but there are a few useful features if you are interested in either of these:
- Magical Cunning: If all your Pact Magic spell slots are expended, you can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute, at the end of which you regain half of those spell slots (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
- Contact Patron: In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw. Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.


[11/28/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
The main thing I want is the 3rd extra attack


[11/28/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
and ritual casting


[11/28/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
where is the 3rd extra attack? i must have missed that


[11/28/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
ritual casting is fine


[11/28/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
THIRSTING    BLADE
Prerequisite:    Level    5+    Warlock,    Pact    of    the    Blade
You    gain    the    Extra    Attack    feature    for    your    pact    
weapon    only.    With    that    feature,    you    can    attack    
twice    with    the    weapon,    instead    of    once,    when    
you    take    the    Attack action    on    your    turn.
When    you    reach    level    11 in    this    class,    this    
Extra    Attack    confers    two    extra attacks    rather    
than    one.


[11/28/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
oh on thirsting blade. i didn't read all the invocations


[11/28/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
with ritual casting and comprehend language, I'd swap out eyes of the rune keeper for something actually useful


[11/28/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
and the third attack makes a huge difference in terms of making sword attacks have parity with eldritch blast + agonizing blast


[11/28/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i actually think ritual casting + comprehend languages is much less useful than eyes of the rune keeper


[11/28/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
you have to be able to touch the writing to understand it


[11/28/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
thats true


[11/28/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so useless for scrying, mirror, any kind of dream vision


[11/28/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
plus you need a 10 minute ritual for it to work


[11/28/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, that is true


[11/28/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
the other thing that would be appealing is the bonus spells


[11/28/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
but sorcerors don't have bonus spells, so might need a bit of tweaking


[11/28/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
anymore more interested in thinking about bastion than warlock rules right now

{Reactions}
👍

[11/28/2023 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
mention it only because i am going to offer cunning strike to wellby and defect attacks to kenzo


[11/28/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
probably won't be any combat next session so can think about warlocks later


[11/28/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
If I was doing anything, new thirsting blade + ritual casting would be the main thing


[11/28/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
Here is what I have for hirelings, still trying to work out who tends each room:

* Deno'qai (shrine)
* Elf (garden + greenhouse)
* Sacred tree (no one)
* Kenku scout + mapmaker (map room)
* Amil + halfling storyteller (hall of stories)
* TDB, observatory

=  7 on top floor

* Training hall 1 (no one/seeker)
* Faldrak (workshop)
* training hall 2 (tbd + tbd)
* archive (tbd)
* smithy (~riswynn smith~)
* reliquary (no one)

= 5 on second floor

storage deck:

* stable (Tbd )
* storage room (Adam Gower, not onboard)

= 2

== 14 total hirelings, of which 13 are on board. 5 are TBD, of which 2 are the orcs, so there are 3 complete TBDs.

If that seems like too many, we could reduce by 2 by not having anyone for the stable (Wellby) and  the Observatory (Seeker) which would be 11 on board which feels kinda reasonable?


[11/28/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
if that still seems like too many we could have the 2nd training hall be just staffed by one orc


[11/28/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
and we'd have 10 on board


[11/28/2023 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i think wellby tends the stable


[11/28/2023 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
(and maybe stable doesn't go in hold? i'd put dwarven stuff there and stable on top deck - i don't think wellby will want baxter in the hold)


[11/28/2023 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe ask schwartz where the stable goes at beginning of next session


[11/28/2023 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
riswynn can tend reliquary


[11/28/2023 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd put one of the orcs on the archive


[11/28/2023 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, the stable could be somewhere else, that's true


[11/28/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd leave observatory open for now too


[11/28/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
seeker / space for some random npc later


[11/28/2023 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
you really like the idea of the orc seeking people of the rainbow as the archivist...


[11/28/2023 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
fine without it if you don't like it


[11/28/2023 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
but the orcs will kind of blend into the background without a hook


[11/28/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
True.


[11/28/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
I've made quarters for 12 for now


[11/28/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
plus the 5 of us


[11/28/2023 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
but I think we will have only 10 or 11 filled


[11/28/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. probably need a guest suite too


[11/28/2023 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Deno'qai, elf, kenku scout, mapmaker, Amil, halfling storyteller, Faldrak, smith apprentice, orcsx2 = 10 plus maybe one more depending on what idea I have for archivist/orcs


[11/28/2023 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
i would not consider the kenku scout a hireling, per se, not guaranteed they will stick around after ursk


[11/28/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
fair, well, the maproom is currently staffed by the kenku + the TBD mapmaker


[11/28/2023 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
they are the person who is going to show you the back route


[11/28/2023 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
mapmaker definitely


[11/28/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
so maybe the kenku isn't a true hireling


[11/28/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
could become one but i wouldn't give them a formal role just yet


[11/28/2023 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[11/28/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
I am considering whether it would be fun to have a sembaran or isinquen or perhaps even a ranger onboard


[11/28/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
one option for mapmaker is an isinguer friend of Guy Marchand


[11/28/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Sembaran certainly possible too, if you wanted a Sembaran archivist for example could be easy to recruit from Tollen


[11/28/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but again, unless an NPC has a very strong hook, they are just going to be a background fixture


[11/28/2023 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
I think with 10 NPCs probably it is ok if some of them are background fixtures


[11/28/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
which is fine


[11/28/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[11/28/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
how about a tyrwinghan


[11/28/2023 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
I'm thinking:

orc twin sisters, about 45-50, one seeking stories of the people of the rainbow, the other sees herself as her defender and keeper and is mostly background, but is a reasonably skilled warrior and tends the 2nd training hall


[11/28/2023 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
a Tyrwinghan, used to be in the army, perhaps even spent some time in the feywild, also tends the training hall, seeking something fey-related


[11/28/2023 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
still pondering details


[11/28/2023 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
and I don't want "seeking fey" really, feels too similar. but something to do with fey


[11/28/2023 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so, doing some session planning, i am actually thinking that I don't want to introduce all the NPCs in one go, no one will remember them and it will be a slow session


[11/28/2023 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
that kinda makes sense


[11/28/2023 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think I'm going to do flashbacks to various meetings in Tollen over the course of the next 4-5 sessions


[11/28/2023 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so next session would just be the orcs and amil/the dwarf


[11/28/2023 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
(and then the kenku meeting and getting off to the adventure)


[11/28/2023 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
so anyone in tollen there would be room to fill in over the next month or two


[11/28/2023 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
the deno'qai could actually be lost in the wilderness


[11/28/2023 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
obviously the deno'qai is wandering around the woods north of ursk


[11/28/2023 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
alright, I will let the idea of a sembaran/tyrwinghan linger


[11/28/2023 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think the orcs should be an archivist and a brawler


[11/28/2023 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus
are you imaging orcs as never had families, families died in war, leaving behind grown kids?


[11/28/2023 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus
kind of thinking maybe the archivist never had a family, the brawler lost family in war and so is finally willing to travel with sister


[11/28/2023 10:09 PM] .deciusmus
I was envisioning a tragic story of some kind for one of them, less sure about the other


[11/28/2023 10:09 PM] .deciusmus
but perhaps actually it is more interesting to invert the stereotype and basically make them empty nesters


[11/28/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
or at least one of them


[11/28/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
I don't know much about orc family life, or lifespan


[11/28/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
how old is 50?


[11/28/2023 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm thinking something like... some tragedy in their youth, lost parents, became very close, archivist married into a large, boisterious, happy family, brawler more reserved and introverted and never had kids but was an aunt, archivist in her late 30s became passionate about the history of her in-laws, who were perhaps a significant in the longer history of the people of the rainbow

many of the family were soliders in the late war, but miraclously, none of them died, which the archivist took to be a sign (from? I guess these orcs don't really like gods.. need to think about that a bit) that she should go looking for stories, brawler is thrilled, has always secretly prefered having her sister to herself


[11/28/2023 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
orc lifespan roughly human conditional on surviving to 30


[11/28/2023 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
most non-free orcs die before 30 from war/famine/violence


[11/28/2023 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
(i guess not famine actually, orcs can survive on almost any food)


[11/28/2023 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so age structure of free orcs probably fairly similar to humans


[11/28/2023 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus
although i imagine a much more bimodal family size - not many with 1 kid, but lots with 0 and lots with 5


[11/28/2023 10:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i have always imagined a significant minority of free orcs would be wary of having kids because they don't fully trust thark won't somehow get them


[11/28/2023 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
and another significant minority would have *lots* of kids because they *do* trust thark wont get them


[11/28/2023 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
I seem to remember that chained-and-freed-after birth orcs have a hard time of it?


[11/28/2023 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/28/2023 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
depends on age they are freed


[11/28/2023 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus
murook was freed very late, as a teenager or close to it, which would be quite unusual


[11/28/2023 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but the freed-after-birth orcs would be very unlikely to leave Xurkhaz


[11/28/2023 10:26 PM] .deciusmus
how's this.

Nurzkar and Aygul are 51 years old, born near Gorzum oasis, to relatively poor farmers. Their parents were both born chained orcs and both struggle. In their father, this manifests as nightmares, weeks sometimes in bed with migraines. In their mother, who was freed when she was 8, this manifests as violent outbursts, where she often has to be restrained. Despite this, the parents are fervant believers in Xurkhaz and envision there salvation will be in their children, born free and unchained and untouched by Thark.


[11/28/2023 10:27 PM] .deciusmus
The twins are born first, then their three siblings, soon after. However, tragedy strikes when the twins are 8. They are at this point old enough to help out on the farm, and one afternoon when their father can't work due to his headaches, their mother goes into a rage and kills the three younger children.


[11/28/2023 10:28 PM] .deciusmus
This dissolves the family - both parents are wracked with guilt, and the twins are fostered out


[11/28/2023 10:29 PM] .deciusmus
(Perhaps the mother is punished, but I have to think there is some understanding and management of chained orcs, anyway the details there are not important to our story)


[11/28/2023 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
The twins grow close to each other in this time, both responding to the tragedy in different ways. Nurzkar wants to **understand**. How are orcs chained? Where did her parents come from (all she knows it that they are from the same horde). Aygul, on the other hand, just wants to learn to defend herself. She never wants to be in the position where someone else can hurt her


[11/28/2023 10:31 PM] .deciusmus
They bounce around orcish society for a while, eventually growing into adults. Nurzkar is the more outgoing one, and ends up meeting <some name>, the 8th son of a large family who proudly traces their lineage back 10 generations


[11/28/2023 10:32 PM] .deciusmus
They marry, have kids, and Nurzkar becomes fascinated by the histories her adoptive family tells


[11/28/2023 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
this sounds great so far


[11/28/2023 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
talking to kate about her dwarf smith so will check in in a bit


[11/28/2023 10:34 PM] .deciusmus
Nurzkar and her husband have a large family, the youngest of whom is an oldish teenage when Grash attacks


[11/28/2023 10:34 PM] .deciusmus
Much of the family ends up in war - by this time they are living in the capital and have some moderately promiment position


[11/28/2023 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
Nurzkar and Aygul both worry -- Aygul perhaps even joins up, despite being a bit on the older side, she is wiry and skilled with weapons and unarmed combat techniques. Both worry about the end of their people. 

Nurzkar, for much of her life, has felt like she could be doing more. The drive to learn/understand/help the chained orcs, and find more orcs to unchain/more People of the Rainbow who are lost kept being put aside due to the basic joy of her life, and the busy-ness of raising a family, etc


[11/28/2023 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
But something happens during the conflict with Grash - my original idea was a prayer but that doesn't really make sense here -- that inspires her to rededicate herself to this childhood dream of learning how Thark chains people and finding others


[11/28/2023 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
So when a flying ship appears, looking for a loremaster and archivist, and willing to carry her around the known world, with her limp and bad eyesight, she jumps


[11/28/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
Her sister is eager to go with her -- Aygul has always been the type who would have gone into the world, but she would not leave her sister, even though her sister kept talking about exploring/looking for stories/etc


[11/28/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
need to tweak a bit but the basic idea is Nurzkar is leaving behind a happy family, Aygul is more of a loner


[11/28/2023 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus
There is a group, called the Hezguli, that is kind of like AA for orcs freed after birth. Murook is an unofficial leader. Orcs that have trouble adjusting, or end up in situations like this, would typically end up living with the Hezguli under their supervision


[11/28/2023 10:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Xurkhaz was founded in 1583 when Uzgash found the cloak, so the timing would be good for the proud family to trace their lineage back to the founders of Xurkhaz


[11/28/2023 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
Right that’s perfect. The mother goes to live with the Hezguli and the father is left to raise them but his headaches and depression really don’t get better and they basically raise themselves


[11/28/2023 10:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Orcs fundamentally think gods are evil, but of course Riswynn will have changed many minds recently. I'd probably make it basically she is inspired by Riswynn


[11/28/2023 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
Faldrak is already the "has a limp and is obviously old character", I think the orc hook is enough to be looking for storie without needing to have the limp and bad eyesight too.


[11/28/2023 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
To add, the father each morning gets up and thanks the miracle of the cloak, because this is better. Having a wife who kills 3 of your kids- better than being chained. Having crushing headaches and nightmares 2-3 times a week? Better than being chained.


[11/28/2023 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
Sure


[11/28/2023 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
can also be a fey connection, or at least a loose one  - "the miracle of the cloak" isn't precisely a miracle, it was a gift from Cloudspinner, an archfey, but it was given as a reward, a boon that was earned (why exactly is not really currently known)


[11/28/2023 10:54 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think the orcs of Xurkhaz especially would, to the extent they have any sort of prayers, it would be to thank their ancestors who earned the boon of a fey


[11/28/2023 10:54 PM] rsulfuratus
so maybe not really a fey connection so much as almost a kind of ancestor worship


[11/28/2023 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
I am envisioning the father more directly thanking the leaders of Xurkhaz


[11/28/2023 10:55 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes, that would definitely make sense


[11/28/2023 10:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it would generally be understood that it is hard, and sometimes dangerous work, to maintain the safe borders of Xurkhaz and the chiefs of Xurkhaz are very much not stay at home kings and queens - they literally have to walk the entire borders of the country over the course of their reign


[11/28/2023 11:02 PM] .deciusmus
I gotta go to bed but either you can work with this as is or I’ll flesh it out a little more tomorrow


[11/28/2023 11:02 PM] .deciusmus
I have some ideas for the Deno’qai as well, will she come up next session?


[11/28/2023 11:03 PM] .deciusmus
I also wrote a whole page on obsidian for all our rooms, I will clean that up and push tomorrow


[11/28/2023 11:05 PM] rsulfuratus
you won't meet Deno'qai next session


[11/29/2023 8:54 AM] rsulfuratus
you vindristjarna room page is great, i love it


[11/29/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
I had a few min, so I implemented a new formatting feature: prefix and suffix

<(prefix)key:format(suffix)>


[11/29/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
prefix and suffix only added if key has a value


[11/29/2023 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
so

<(of )primary>

means if there is a primary value, add of primary, else nothing


[11/29/2023 11:26 AM] .deciusmus
or 

<(()pronouns())> means add (he/him) or nothing


[11/29/2023 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
at some point, i think we need to think a bit about locations like "traveling to Tokra", since I'm not actually sure the capital letter parsing is the correct framework here.


[11/29/2023 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd argue that there are two distinct things:
(a) page is in location at time, but you want some flavor text, e.g. imprisoned in Stormcaller Tower
(b) page is in a location that is not represented by a note, either because it is not a fixed location (sailing to Skaerhem; traveling to Chardon), or because it is an area that doesn't really have a name or any kind of detail (plains east of Tokra)


[11/29/2023 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
(a) is probably correctly handled with prefix/suffix data - location is Stormcaller Tower, prefix is "imprisoned in"


[11/29/2023 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
(b) is probably correctly handled by just not expanding the chain. someone who is traveling to Tokra isn't in Tokra and shouldn't show up on a list of NPCs in Tokra, for example


[11/29/2023 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but, i'm not sure that string formatting is the best way to handle this. this is what i think a normalized name object would be good for. prefix/suffix is great for changing "in The InnName" to "at TheInnName"


[11/29/2023 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, super busy today and also still have session prep, so not going to do anything on this


[11/29/2023 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but I would argue for:
(a) a concept of a normalized name, that provides a universal object interface to handle getting the actual file something represents, as well as linking, display text, title, article, and other name-related topics
(b) concept of approximate locations that are text descriptions without a location chain, or that imply a different location chain, e.g., perhaps "traveling to Tokra (Central Dunmar area)" or something
(c) string formatting primarily to replace prepositions, although how much do you use this instead of just replacing the preposition in the displayDefault string? you have to retype the entire string to replace the default prepositions anyway. i guess for whereabouts it could be nice if you can override on a per-whereabout-line basis


[11/29/2023 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess lumping the prepositions into string formatting helps with trimming extraneous bits of text


[11/29/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
The main goal of the string formatting is to have the default strings be able to be simpler


[11/29/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
i.e dropping the of


[11/29/2023 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
for example, I made the location default something like

ancestry subtype type of primary in current


[11/29/2023 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
so 

a Dunmari monstery of Bhisma in Kharsan


[11/29/2023 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
but it is a pain to drop the of / in easily


[11/29/2023 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
without the prefix / suffix


[11/29/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
So I agree about normalized name (mostly this would be moving the upper casing and article stuff to name manager from string formatter)


[11/29/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
I also agree that whereabouts would really benefit from a "prefix" / "suffix" which is added to the whereabout (i.e. for imprisoned in, trapped in, etc) vs the idea of a whereabout that represents a non-page place


[11/29/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
I do think that for non-page places, I like the "travelling to Embry, Sembara" but that the "in location" checks shouldn't follow the capitalized pieces


[11/29/2023 1:20 PM] .deciusmus
but otherwise, I'd guess the capitalization rule would largely work


[11/29/2023 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. you'd like to be able to define:

{ location: Stormcaller Tower, prefix: trapped in }

which would cause the "current" or "home" or "origin" for that page to display

trapped in Stormcaller Tower

this is different from the location

near Stormcaller Tower

which implies the person is NOT in storm caller tower (but might imply they ARE in the parent location of storm caller tower)


[11/29/2023 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
although it is probably ok for people with vague locations to be considered "no where" as far as dataview queries go


[11/29/2023 1:22 PM] .deciusmus
(and if you wanted, you could always do something like

location: Sembara, locationDisplay: travelling to Embry

which would cause data view searches to find the location as Sembara, but display it as travelling to Embry
)


[11/29/2023 1:23 PM] .deciusmus
The other piece that comes up a lot is the preposition. If a string is

Met by <person> on <target> in <current>

you'd really like the "in" to come from the <current> rather than the format string


[11/29/2023 1:24 PM] .deciusmus
That solves the "in/on" problem


[11/29/2023 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
Which is to say, I'd propose the following set of features:

1. Introduce a "prefix" on a whereabout line. If set, it is prepended to the lcoation for display, but otherwise has no impact on the location searches or other logic about "where" something is

2. Introduce a "prepositionFor" display default which defaults to "in" for places and "" for everything else. It might be nicer to wait to do this until we have a normalized name manager, because you'd like this to be like casing/formatting. That is, the name manager should have an article option of none, prepositional, definite, indefinite (or similar) that can map to format strings with reasonable defaults.

This is to enable changing: 
<met:u> by <person> on <target> in <current:3r>

To

<met:u> by <person> on <target> <current:3r>

And having the in/on generated correctly.


3. Make sure that the isInLocation logic stops following if the name doesn't match i.e. the capital letter stuff is only for display, not for in-location checks


[11/29/2023 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
The key thing is that the preposition stuff is a property of the *location* whereas the prefix is a property of the whereabout


[11/29/2023 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
generally yes, agree. I think the prepositions are a bit tricky. e.g. for a location that is "The Singing Fox", you might want:
Based in: Fairgate Outer, Tollen (<home:fr>)
Last seen by party at The Singing Fox, Tollen ("at <current:1>, <current:3>")


[11/29/2023 1:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but even if you didn't skip the inn for based in, you probably don't want:
Based in: at The Singing Fox, Fairgate Outer, Tollen


[11/29/2023 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
So I guess it implies that the preposition needs to be a property of the location and the type (origin/home etc)


[11/29/2023 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
which feels complicated


[11/29/2023 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
its just a format specifier


[11/29/2023 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
p = include preposition (default is to not)


[11/29/2023 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
right but the point is whether you include the preposition feels like it depends on whether the location is origin, home, current


[11/29/2023 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
no, it depends on the format string


[11/29/2023 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
"wHome": "Based in: <home:3r>",
            "wPast": "<end:u> in <current:3r>",


[11/29/2023 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
1st one - no preposition


[11/29/2023 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
2nd one - yes


[11/29/2023 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. you modify the 2nd string to be

<end:u> <current:3rp>


[11/29/2023 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
(ignore that p is already used)


[11/29/2023 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
then it generates died at The Singing Fox


[11/29/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
and you have one less case where you need to do a display override to get the right thing


[11/29/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
the only problem it is intended to solve is to reduce display overrides


[11/29/2023 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
but it introduces the new problem you need to set prepositions? i'm not sure which is less typing


[11/29/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
well, the default would be "in"


[11/29/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
so you only need to do so if you don't like in


[11/29/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay I see


[11/29/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
the displayDefault is in The Singing Fox ala defArt


[11/29/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/29/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
I thought you were setting the preposition in the whereabout line


[11/29/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
no


[11/29/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
that would be hard to use, agreed


[11/29/2023 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I would change wHome to "Based <home:3rp>" then


[11/29/2023 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/29/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
Based in X vs Based in: X kind of meanless but it gets you Based on the Emerald Song naturally


[11/29/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/29/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
Originally from probably stays, if you want "Born at sea on the Emerald Song" you need to set wOrigin


[11/29/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
right


[11/29/2023 2:00 PM] .deciusmus
(unless you change origin to <startStatus> <origin>


[11/29/2023 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
But I like Originally from: better than "Born in"


[11/29/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I do to, i'd leave that


[11/29/2023 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
So I think I'd leave it


[11/29/2023 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
you could make the default preposition for a person "by"


[11/29/2023 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
which would also be nice


[11/29/2023 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
because then item origin could just be

<start> <origin>

and you get

Created in Kharsan

or 

Created by Grash

automatically


[11/29/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[11/29/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
depending on how complicated, i'd also introduce automatic preposition insertion when you switch type in a location chain


[11/29/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., Created by Grash in Kharsan


[11/29/2023 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
ah, that would be nice


[11/29/2023 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
instead of comma


[11/29/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
rather than Created by Grash, Kharsan


[11/29/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[11/29/2023 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
that would actually work really well


[11/29/2023 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think for items and places you probably don't want both a "page date" and a "location" line


[11/29/2023 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
although that's a separate topic and I gotta go do work


[11/29/2023 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
so not for right now


[11/29/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
easy enough to just set what you don't want to "" in displayDefaults IMO


[11/29/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a few items I changed to "Created by X in date"


[11/29/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
or played with, not sure I committed


[11/29/2023 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
think it is easier to just do it that way if you don't want both or what a merge of the two


[11/29/2023 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
For someone like Vola with a line that currently says:
Traveling in Dunmar

I’d assume you’d want them to show up in a filter that finds everyone in Dunmar


[11/29/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yes. i think that what you suggested before of display information is the best idea here


[11/29/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
a location is always the most precisely specified place a note can be located


[11/29/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but then there is a way to have it display more information, e.g. traveling in Dunar


[11/29/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
actually traveling in Dunmar is no different from imprisoned in Stormcaller Tower


[11/29/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
it is just "traveling east from Tokra" that is diferent


[11/29/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
depending on whether we care about being able to easily query this information, it might make sense for this to be part of the normalized name


[11/29/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
since traveling east from Tokra could be thought of as basically just linktext for Dunmar


[11/29/2023 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
Right, so the prefixes are super easy and basically work


[11/29/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus

{type: away, start: 1748-03-20, end: 1748-04-22, location: traveling to Chardon}

Still works, i.e. the split on capital letter still happens, but inLocation behaves differently


[11/29/2023 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
The Nevos Sea one, inLocation reports true for Nevos Sea
the traveling to Chardon, in location does not report true for Chardon


[11/29/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
conceptually could implement a locationDisplayAlias, but I think better to see if it is really useful first


[11/29/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
in general, it is probably fine if "travelling" people don't appear in any actual location


[11/29/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
the use case would be whereabouts of someone like Havdar or Sura who travel a lot but always in Dunmar. Would be nice to put "Dunmar" as their location, and then "riding east from Tokra" as the text, so they still come up in Dunmar searches


[11/29/2023 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
but do you really want a search of all people in Dunmar?


[11/29/2023 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, it can be done, I am just not going to do it right now


[11/29/2023 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
the most useful search would be all people in dunmar not in a city right now


[11/29/2023 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
for example


[11/29/2023 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
which theoretically should be possible since we can get a list of cities/towns/villages using typeof


[11/29/2023 3:51 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/29/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
prefix solves a lot of the current ones though


[11/29/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
So I just looked at all the whereabouts lines with of / to / in / near / travel / ride / sail


[11/29/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
+ north/south/east/west


[11/29/2023 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
basically, there are exactly 2 cases:

(a) a bunch of Dunmari who are on the plains (north/south/east) of (Songra/Tokra) (or a few other cases, like desert west of Kharsan)

(b) a bunch of travelers, i.e. via traveling to Chardon


[11/29/2023 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
case (a) I think is largely lack of names. In Sembara, I'd probably just say:

prefix: western plains of, location: Barony of Dunfry


[11/29/2023 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
but in Dunmar there really isn't good or sensible names for various stretches of the place


[11/29/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I think in Dunmar some of that reflects nomadic people as well. probably their should be names for some of these broad areas


[11/29/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
So for that one specific use case, you probably would prefer something like

location: Central Dunmar, locationDisplayAlias: plains west of Tokra


[11/29/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, as you say, there should be a name


[11/29/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
the XXXX plains


[11/29/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
part of the issue in dunmar is doesn't have the kind of political organization that makes it sensible to have relatively constrained political subunits


[11/29/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
and it is a bit tedious / hard to name six different plains


[11/29/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but in-world the Dunmari surely would have names for the land they travel over and live on


[11/29/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
that isn't just "the plains west of Tokra"


[11/29/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, a simple option is ~Plains West of Tokra~


[11/29/2023 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that's not a bad idea


[11/29/2023 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
and if you add "plains west of Tokra" as an alias you can find it without needing to display the ~ / ~


[11/29/2023 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
traveling to is still a little awkward because you don't want to use a prefix for that. that is actually the case where you want: "location: Chardonian Empire, locationAlias: traveling to Chardon"


[11/29/2023 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
then you could remove capital letter procesing entirely and have InLocation work a little more seemlessly if you ever want to make a list of everyone in dunmar, etc


[11/29/2023 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
but a very minor thing


[11/29/2023 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
the only places left that are not linked, that I can find, are:

Grumella    north of Voltara
Herasto             plains south of Voltara


[11/29/2023 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
+ various travelling ones


[11/29/2023 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
those are both just shorthand for unnamed geographic features


[11/29/2023 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
could actually set them both as the voltara plains (which has a non-canonical name and I think a ~Voltara Plains~ page), and just put prefix as north for Grumella and south for Herasto


[11/29/2023 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
or maybe northern part of and southern part of


[11/29/2023 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
actually, if you have a suffix option, that could be the solution for traveling


[11/29/2023 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
prefix: traveling through
location: Chardonian Empire
suffix: to Chardon


[11/29/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
I was wondering if there should just be a "type: travel"


[11/29/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
with a from: and to:


[11/29/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
not sure if it is worthwhile though


[11/29/2023 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
from is generally recorded in whereabouts already, at least if it is known


[11/29/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[11/29/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
I gotta go but I made a DV query that gets all of the whereabouts that are not linked


[11/29/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
there are currently 43 of them after my cleanup


[11/29/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
most are travelling or the villages of the Deno'qai which don't have pages yet


[11/29/2023 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
So there are 27 whereabouts lines that are not linked to anything now


[11/29/2023 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
I will push later tonight


[11/29/2023 8:15 PM] rsulfuratus
probably about as close as I'll be able to get to twins with Dall-E

[11/29/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
note the prepositions


[11/29/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
seems to work pretty well


[11/29/2023 11:13 PM] .deciusmus
So I got a little carried away with prepositions and such, it actually works almost perfectly, a few little things to clear up but between prepositions and prefixes you can get a nice chain like:
Trapped in the Mirror of Soul Trapping, stored on Vindrijarna, piloted by the Dunmar Fellowship, in Tollen


[11/30/2023 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
trying to organize some details of human migrations / cultures a bit more clearly to help figure out some details about some things that might come up towards the end of the session tonight. going to push a page to brainstorming before 1:30, and then in meetings until 4pm. if you have a chance to look and see anything you think is wrong, let me know


[11/30/2023 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
got sucked into a meeting so nevermind


[11/30/2023 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
not getting to this before the session


[11/30/2023 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
Btw I was thinking about export a bit some more. It would be pretty easy to write a template command that materialized all of the headers at a specific date. 

The simplest export flow could be to ignore the python duplicate code entirely and just do…

git branch export
Open obsidian
Run command that updates all headers using a fixed date
Close obsidian
Run export 
git checkout main; git branch -d export


[11/30/2023 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
that is a good idea


[11/30/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
still could use python code for cleaning markdown but would not have to reimplement dataview commands


[11/30/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
we've been working on a new website for my lab and so i'm messing around a little bit with python code to write html from markdown templates - I suspect ultimately the best use of python coding time is to move away from a dependence on obdianhtml, which is no longer maintained


[11/30/2023 6:45 PM] .deciusmus
I managed to do a bit of a PoC in between other things and it defintely works fine


[12/1/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
so, i was messing around a bit with homebrew stuff for playtest updates this morning - warlocks are quite tricky because most of the changes are built into invocations which so far I haven't figured out a way to modify via homebrew.


[12/1/2023 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
also, for delwath, i have bit of a conundrum since one d&d shifts all subclasses to level 3, so if you straight convert you would lose a bunch of sorcerer spells and favor of the gods, in exchange for gaining better warlock invocations + more warlock spells


[12/1/2023 9:50 AM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, sorcerers gain metamagic at level 2 and gain sorcery incarnate at level 1, which gives bonus to sorcerer spells (+1 DC and advantage on attack rolls)


[12/1/2023 9:54 AM] rsulfuratus
I think what I would do is:
1) leave sorcerer alone (effectively swapping the level you get metamagic and favor of the gods, and sacrificing sorcery incarnate -- which isn't that impactful for Delwath anyway)
2) balance bonus spells so you get 10 total from warlock + sorcerer


[12/1/2023 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm going to send an email with thoughts


[12/1/2023 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
Actually I think reskinning to UA stuff would work fine.  Basically the bonus sorceror spells were always flavored as "tanshi", so moving to warlock makes perfect sense


[12/1/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
Delwath would go from having 5 sorcerer spells (3 from level, 2 bonus) and 11 warlock spells to 4 sorcerer spells and 21 warlock spells


[12/1/2023 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
which is obviously way better but fits with the UA model


[12/1/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
Also, assuming I just kept Hex Warrior unchanged (but technically having gotten it at 3rd level rather than 1st) and kept invocations unchanged, he'd go from 5 invocations to 7, but one of the new ones would be Pact Weapon


[12/1/2023 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
So the next would be 1 new invocation


[12/1/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is easy, you just take the eldritch adept feat


[12/1/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
the annoying thing is actually changing the invocations themselves


[12/1/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
But no need


[12/1/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
The only meanful change is thirsting blade given 3 attacks, I would just remember that


[12/1/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, i guess you are better at remembering things than most of the rest of the party


[12/1/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
the rest of them don't change


[12/1/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not going to forget that I get 3 instead of 2 attack


[12/1/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
you can change damage type of pact of the blade, and you can use the mastery property of your pact weapon


[12/1/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
I was potentially going to just ignore those


[12/1/2023 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but honestly warlock gets enough other goodies if you forget about those it doesn't matter


[12/1/2023 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus
probably easier to just ignore them


[12/1/2023 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
Changing the damage type doesn't seem quite right, flavor-wise


[12/1/2023 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
well you could change it to be all radiant which could make sense


[12/1/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
The mastery property does, but I'd rather just play with the 5E pact weapon rules where I store the sword in an extra-dimensional space but not get mastery, at least for now


[12/1/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
sur


[12/1/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
*sure


[12/1/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
(The UA rules read to me like the intention is that if you bond with a magic weapon, it is just a regular magic weapon, i.e. you have to carry it around like normal)


[12/1/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is how i read it too


[12/1/2023 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
so:
1) you'll just remember the invocation changes (3 attacks, ignore the rest)
2) you'll take the edritch adept feat to represent your extra invocation
3) I'll update yezali subclass to add bonus spells (2 per level, with the first level ones copied from sorcerer)
4) I'll update sorcerer to give you one bonus 1st level spell at level 3, to represent the bonus spell you'd normally get for divine soul
5) we'll ignore other sorcerer changes in one D&D, figuring they come out in the wash


[12/1/2023 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, makes sense


[12/1/2023 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm going to poke around at spells a bit


[12/1/2023 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
Add contact other plane to the yezali subclass as well, that is a useful feature that seems very flavor - appropriate


[12/1/2023 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/1/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
magical cunning I will either remember or forget about, don't worry about trying to add to D&D beyond


[12/1/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
It is easy to track as an item, if I just want to remember if I used it or not


[12/1/2023 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
Actually that's what I'd do


[12/1/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
that one is actually quite easy to add


[12/1/2023 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
anyway I'll mess around


[12/1/2023 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
for spells, these are the hexblade spells:
1st    shield, wrathful smite
2nd    blur, branding smite
3rd    blink, elemental weapon
4th    phantasmal killer, staggering smite
5th    banishing smite, cone of cold


[12/1/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
the smite spells are flavorful


[12/1/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
elemental weapon, phantsamal killer, and cone of cold are not particularly "Yezali" to me


[12/1/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
What we were originally planning on doing was flavoring each level of sorcerer with spells from a different tanshi


[12/1/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
ah right


[12/1/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
the 1st level spells were "blessing of betali: sleep & sanctuary"


[12/1/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
definitely need to keep sleep given the critical in game use during the kadmos battle


[12/1/2023 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
yes I was going to swap the 1st level for sleep and sanctuary already


[12/1/2023 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
to keep those


[12/1/2023 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
you also have used sanctuary a decent among


[12/1/2023 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
*amount


[12/1/2023 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
also true


[12/1/2023 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
But I could take sanctuary as a sorcerer spell


[12/1/2023 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
One way of flavoring it might be that each level gets one spell from Yezali and one from someone else.

1st: shield - yezali, sleep - betali
2nd: either of the hexblade ones - yezali, ?? - someone else
3rd: blink - yezali, ?? - someone else
4th: staggering smite - yezali, ?? someone else
5th: banishing smite - yezali, ?? someone else


[12/1/2023 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
then I swap shield (which I took as a sorcerer spell) for sanctuary instead and end up with the same 1st level spells


[12/1/2023 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
right that could work, let me fiddle around a bit


[12/1/2023 11:02 AM] .deciusmus
actually all of the smite spells feel pretty good


[12/1/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
although they don't play well with other concentration spells


[12/1/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
that is a one D&D change to import - all the smite spells are "when you hit with an attack, cast this as a bonus action" no concentration


[12/1/2023 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
except the ones that have ongoing effects


[12/1/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
in the delwath solo, belati was not one of the lost tanshi, so i might update the spell sources to be consistent with the lost tanshi:

[12/1/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense


[12/1/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
I don't remember where betali came from


[12/1/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
but I like being consistent


[12/1/2023 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
and actually it works perfectly to have 1 spell from each, plus 5 from yezali


[12/1/2023 11:20 AM] .deciusmus
Also, Hunter's Mark might be a reasonable non-smite choice as a more flavor-appriopriate form of Hex


[12/1/2023 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
level 1: shield (Yezali), sleep (Midri)
level 2: moonbeam (Yezali), blur (K'onisati)
level 3: blinding smite (with Playtest 6 modifications; Yezali), tongues (Taraka)
level 4: shadow of moil (Yezali), arcane eye (Nisir)
level 5: banishing smite (with Playtest 6 modification; Yezali), cone of cold (Yaliki'i)

some thematically appropriate substitutions that I might consider:
level 2: blur (Yezali), alter self (K'onisati)
level 4: staggering smite (Yezali) or sickening radiance (Yezali) instead of shadow of moil


[12/1/2023 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
also: if you are going to take the one D&D buffs, I think you need to take the spell revisions. the two that affect Delwath would be:
(1) counterspell forces a con save and the target only loses the spell if they fail
(2) banish gives a save at the end of each turn to return; banishing smite gives a save on hit (but does not give save at end of turn)


[12/1/2023 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
I have no issue with the counterspell rules as long as caster who tries to counter Delwath's spell has the same rules


[12/1/2023 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/1/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
banish makes sense as well, although I might reconsider whether it is worthwhile with a save at end of each turn


[12/1/2023 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
I liked Shining Smite quite a bit


[12/1/2023 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that's fine. i was trying to avoid too many concentration smites (blinding does not require concentration)


[12/1/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
I think Shining Smite - skinned as the moonlight vibe from moonbeam - is more fun


[12/1/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
will swap that for moonbeam for sure


[12/1/2023 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
It is concentration, but against an invisible foe, super useful and worth the concentration. And moonbeam is a fun spell but not one delwath is super likely to ever cast


[12/1/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
do you want to still keep blinding smite then?


[12/1/2023 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
which is less thematic but has the advantage of no concentration so you can stack it on a concentration buff


[12/1/2023 12:29 PM] .deciusmus
I think thematically having Yezali stuff be mostly smites makes sense


[12/1/2023 12:29 PM] .deciusmus
The above list honestly feels a little too good 🙂


[12/1/2023 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
i think i would leave shadow of moil which was a good spell but rarely worth the concentration these days (but you used it a fair bit when you first got it)


[12/1/2023 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
that gives two defense and three offense for yezali


[12/1/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
arcane eye and cone of cold might be a little strong for nisir and yaliki


[12/1/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but they are very thematic


[12/1/2023 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
I agree about shadow of moil, although maybe reskinned to be resistant to something other than radiant damage?


[12/1/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
radiant is a super-uncommon damage type to face so it is hard to change it to something else without significantly buffing the spell


[12/1/2023 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
it just feels themeactically weird


[12/1/2023 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
thunder or psychic are roughly equally rare, not sure either makes any more sense


[12/1/2023 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
radiant is like "super strong light" so i'm not sure it is actually thematically wrong, it isn't necessarily "holy"


[12/1/2023 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, probably easier to just keep it


[12/1/2023 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
spider climb could be an alternative to blur; same with enthrall (skinned as a cloud of butterflies)


[12/1/2023 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
i like enthrall


[12/1/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
otherwise blur and shadow of moil kinda feel the same


[12/1/2023 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
I can't think of something better than cone of cold for Yaliki


[12/1/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
this list seems pretty good, if a bit on the powerful side:

level 1: shield (Yezali), sleep (Midri)
level 2: shining smite (Yezali), enthrall (K'onisati)
level 3: blinding smite (with Playtest 6 modifications; Yezali), tongues (Taraka)
level 4: shadow of moil (Yezali), arcane eye (Nisir)
level 5: banishing smite (with Playtest 6 modification; Yezali), cone of cold (Yaliki'i)


[12/1/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the Yezali spells are thematic and balanced by being very concentration/bonus action heavy


[12/1/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
sleep for Midri will definitely stay for consistency


[12/1/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
and tongues for Taraka is perfect


[12/1/2023 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
here is an alternative idea for the others:
level 2calm emotions (Yaliki'i, from the clear mind aspect); level 4 freedom of movement (K'onisati); level 5 scrying (Nisir)


[12/1/2023 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure if that is overall stronger or weaker


[12/1/2023 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
it gives me a extra "Whatever I want" spell


[12/1/2023 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
which is technically more powerful


[12/1/2023 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
Freedom of Movement is interesting idea though


[12/1/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is definitely more powerful though


[12/1/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
Calm Emotions is much better than Enthrall


[12/1/2023 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
Scrying is not necessarily better than arcane eye or cone of cold, but it is a spell delwath already has, so the net effect is I can pick up any spell in exchange


[12/1/2023 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
Arcane Eye is probably more useful than Freedom of Movement though


[12/1/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
What about Entrall (k'onisati), ice storm (yaliki'i), scry (nisir)


[12/1/2023 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
Or:

Frost Fingers (1st level, Yaliki), Grasping Vine (4th level, Midri), Scry (Nisir)


[12/1/2023 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
I really like Enthrall as a flock of butterflies for Konstani


[12/1/2023 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
And tongues for Taraka


[12/1/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
But I have 4 1st level sorcerer spells from sorcorer: For game consistency they have to include Sanctuary, Sleep, and Shield


[12/1/2023 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
But I could drop absorb elements or create/destroy water


[12/1/2023 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
(I've never cast absorb elements and I don't think I've cast create/destory water)


[12/1/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
The set (sleep, arcane eye, cone of cold) is the best set of actual useful spells, as cone of cold is a good AoE, which Delwath doesn't have (sickening radiance isn't always the best choice), and arcane eye is just very useful


[12/1/2023 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
you only have 3 level one sorcerer spells (absorb elements, create/destroy water, shield) plus sleep and sanctuary as bonus spells


[12/1/2023 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
i like sleep as midri, it is a good flavor for hibernation


[12/1/2023 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
i also like enthrall as kostani


[12/1/2023 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly i think that as it is already a strong set of bonus spells having both a very useful out of combat scouting option AND a very useful AoE is too much


[12/1/2023 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I kinda agree. But not sure where the fix is. Moving nisir to scry doesn’t change anything I just take arcane eye with my newly freed slot


[12/1/2023 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, I was looking at UA sorcerers who have 4 known spells at second level


[12/1/2023 1:44 PM] rsulfuratus
i think sleep (midri), enthrall (kosanti), tongues (taraka), ice storm (yaliki), scry (nisir) is fine.

ice storm is a worse aoe than cone of cold; you are already getting two spells to pick with tongues and banishing smite and the 3rd best new spell you could pick is probably not that strong anyway


[12/1/2023 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, I think delwath is all updated. you'll have to add the eldritch adept feat to get the extra invocation, and you have 1 sorcerer spell and 3 warlock spells free to choose


[12/1/2023 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I did not make new versions of counterspell and banish yet - will eventually do this for counterspell, but if you decide not to keep banish i'm not going to make a one d&d version


[12/1/2023 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i did make new versions of the smite spells


[12/1/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
you need to remove sanctuary from Blessings of the Tanshi


[12/1/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
I also seem to have contact other plane 2x


[12/1/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
nevermind


[12/1/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
that is correct


[12/1/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
once is the free usage


[12/1/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
Blinding Smite is also not correctly upgrading damage when cast with  5th lvl slot


[12/1/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
Or did you mean for me to get Sanctuary from the Tanshi as the "one free spell" from divine soul?


[12/1/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, you did


[12/1/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
thats the 1 sorceror spell


[12/1/2023 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yes meant the sanctuary as one free spell; will check blinding smite and see what the issue is


[12/1/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
you might need to switch back to the old yezali and then to the new one again to get the blinding smite to update


[12/1/2023 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
blinding smite just doesn't seem to have scaling in the spell


[12/1/2023 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
switching doesn't help


[12/1/2023 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I had the type of higher level scaling set wrong. just fixed it. hopefully will update


[12/1/2023 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
doesn't seem to have helped


[12/1/2023 4:56 PM] rsulfuratus
its fixed


[12/1/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
yup


[12/1/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
thanks


[12/1/2023 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
I think I am going to take

Healing Word
Dream
Synaptic Static
Mislead


[12/1/2023 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
you don't want a damage boost like hex or spirit shroud? 3 attacks makes them very strong


[12/1/2023 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
honestly although your sword is cool, with 3 attacks shadow blade is also rather strong


[12/1/2023 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(but probably not delwath's flavor)


[12/1/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
I am thinking of taking life drinker


[12/1/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
whatever is it


[12/1/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
invocation that gives +1d6


[12/1/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
Hex is good but it takes concentration


[12/1/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
spirit shroud is very powerful though


[12/1/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
+2d8 is pretty good


[12/1/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
that would actually be an ungodly amount of damage"

4d8 + 1d6 + 10 (x3) against anyone I've hunter's cursed


[12/1/2023 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
well it is very bonus action heavy


[12/1/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
it takes 2 bonus actions to set up


[12/1/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
that is true


[12/1/2023 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
one for spirit shroud, one for hunters curse


[12/1/2023 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
but also monks make 5 attacks and wellby can knock someone out with one hit if they fail a con save, so you do need to keep up


[12/1/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
The smites are very powerful


[12/1/2023 5:05 PM] rsulfuratus
actually with the one d&d stuff seeker and riswynn kind of get left behind because they don't really optimize spells at all


[12/1/2023 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
blinding smite is 5d8 per cast, no concentration


[12/1/2023 5:05 PM] rsulfuratus
and no save for initial blindness


[12/1/2023 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
so with x3 attacks and hexblade curse thing you fish for criticals then drop 14d8 when you get one


[12/1/2023 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
the smites are amazing because you can cast it once you know you rolled a crit


[12/1/2023 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, 10d10 + 4d8 is even better, it just depends on whether concentration is running on something else


[12/1/2023 5:10 PM] rsulfuratus
crit smites are a lot of fun but I think mathematically suboptimal, because if you don't roll a crit early there is a good chance the extra crit damage won't matter (you would have killed it anyway with 7d8+10)


[12/1/2023 5:10 PM] .deciusmus
true


[12/1/2023 5:11 PM] .deciusmus
it is a bit hard to know on which attack to drop the smite


[12/1/2023 5:11 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. do you drop it on your first one that hits, or wait for crit


[12/1/2023 5:12 PM] .deciusmus
but once I get quicken spell at next level, there is so much to do with bonus action you just kinda wait and see


[12/1/2023 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
mathematically, I think if you are going to use a smite it is better to use it on your first hit than wait


[12/1/2023 5:12 PM] .deciusmus
missed with your last attack? don't smite, cast something else


[12/1/2023 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
(except banish which you want to hold on for the status effect at <50 hp)


[12/1/2023 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
but e.g. blinding the one round guaranteed blind is worth more than the extra crit damage, especially if you are going before kenzo and can set up 5 attacks with advantage


[12/1/2023 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
true


[12/1/2023 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes with quicken the bonus action becomes very valulable and so more complicated - e.g. quicken booming blade is very strong too


[12/1/2023 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
or quicken green flame if you are fighting hordes. you could likely take out 6-7 minions in one turn with three attacks + quicken green flame


[12/1/2023 5:14 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[12/1/2023 5:14 PM] .deciusmus
i have basically never used green flame


[12/1/2023 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
but actually I think the math for it is pretty good


[12/1/2023 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
it is good if you are fighting multiple enemies, and booming is good if you can get the movement effect to trigger, but neither is better than 2 attacks if you don't get the rider effects


[12/1/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that's true


[12/1/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
but e.g. against minions you really should be using green flame because you take out 2 and have a good chance to take out 3 if you hit, and minions usually don't have a high ac


[12/1/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
against e.g. grash it is much more dubious


[12/1/2023 5:20 PM] .deciusmus
anyway, shadow blade is not the right vibe, but I might consider sprit shroud instead of mislead or dream


[12/1/2023 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
honestly if you want hunter's mark instead of hex that would be fine too, they are basically the same spell


[12/1/2023 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
but might not be worth the concentration / bonus action tax


[12/1/2023 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
the problem with hex/hunter's mark is the concentation


[12/1/2023 5:22 PM] .deciusmus
There is no point in having that and shadow shroud, for example, as you can only keep one of them up


[12/1/2023 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
right. 

btw if you want the 1D&D version of lifedrinker as your extra invocation, it should be possible to homebrew that as a feat


[12/1/2023 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, I see it that there are 2 different paths I could take....
lean on smites for bonus action/additional damage and use concentration for buff/debuff/control (sickening radiance/fly/shadow of moil/banish)


[12/1/2023 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
or just fully optimize for damage and assume concentration will mostly be going to a +dice per hit spell (spirit shroud is probably the best option there)


[12/1/2023 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
being able to fly in the grath fight thou was really useful


[12/1/2023 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean fly + blinding smite is very strong it is just spell-slot-heavy


[12/1/2023 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
yeah but it is super rare for us to have two combats where it is worth buring much in the way of spells without a short rest in between


[12/1/2023 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that's true


[12/1/2023 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so it probably doesn't matter


[12/1/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
the smite-heavy playstyle seems fun even it if is not quite as damage optimized


[12/1/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
and the magic cunning + pact of the rod keeper gives me one complete spell slot reset per day anyway


[12/1/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
(magic cunning gives back 2, pact the 3rd)


[12/1/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/1/2023 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
plus mental prison is also pretty strong


[12/1/2023 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
even though it fizzled against grash


[12/1/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i forgot in the grash fight they still take damage even if the save succeeds, and creatures immune to charm just auto-succeed


[12/1/2023 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
they aren't immune to the spell completely


[12/1/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
right, I misread that as well


[12/1/2023 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
kenzo rolling high on initiative is pretty important to your playstyle because you and seeker both have big spells that fizzle against charm immunity


[12/1/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
If I had remembered about soul sight I could have just spent the first round tossing something else out, or even just attacking


[12/1/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
there is probably an argument for going damage in round 1 and then dropping the big spell in round 2 if kenzo is behind you


[12/1/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
there is probably an argument for going damage in round 1 and then dropping the big spell in round 2 if kenzo is behind you


[12/1/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/1/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
it is tough to remember not just your abilities but everyone else's too


[12/1/2023 5:31 PM] .deciusmus
The grash fight was pretty awesome, so it worked out


[12/1/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
honestly the big spell fizzling kinda worked narratively even if it was annoying the moment


[12/1/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/1/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, I might change up something for Spirit Shroud, but Dream is pretty appealing, because even with teleport, being able to talk to someone in their sleep is pretty powerful


[12/1/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah Dream is super-useful, i'd probably keep that


[12/1/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
you can always leave things as they are and swap something on level up if you want


[12/1/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
Although what does "known to you" mean, something you will have to figure out. Is the guy I scryed once with the jade hand "known to me"


[12/1/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
*jade fragment in Ursk


[12/1/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
no, it has to be someone you've met


[12/1/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
doesn't have to be someone you are friends with


[12/1/2023 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
I should send scary nightmares to fausto


[12/1/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, you could kill someone by just nightmaring them every night, if they keep failing their saves and don't have a good alternative source of healing. Sure they can burn hit dice but they don't get them back...


[12/1/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
That is a bit dark but sorta appealing to try to mess with fausto that way


[12/1/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
I have to remember to collect body parts and hair clippings and thing from our enemies more


[12/1/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
both for scry and dream


[12/1/2023 5:40 PM] .deciusmus
On a different topic...


[12/1/2023 5:40 PM] .deciusmus
I have mostly been working, but I did spent a bit of time yesterday and this afternoon on the Obsidian stuff


[12/1/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
I have two things basically working:

1. prepositions. add "q" to the format specifier and it adds prepositions
2. prepare for export, which makes the headers all static


[12/1/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus

[12/1/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
It is not super well tested, but I figure I should just push it anywy?


[12/1/2023 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/1/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
For export there is a new template, "prepare for export". 

It shows a dialog for the "Export date" and then processes all files that have a header version attribute by regenerating the header in "static" mode as of the date you typed in


[12/1/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
you just need to be careful to not commit the changes


[12/1/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
changing the filter is pretty trivial


[12/1/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
I was just messing around with how not to run header generation on pages that have not previously had a header generated, so where it might fail or have weird side effectives


[12/1/2023 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i mean you can always revert, but I think my workflow would be:
1) run python to generate a new obsidian vault with %%^Campaign%% stuff stripped
2) run template to make static
3) run osidianhtml to make html


[12/1/2023 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
that probably works pretty well


[12/1/2023 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
if you just leave the `--dview` option off the python code it will just pass code without doing conversion


[12/1/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, the template no longer bothers with the intermediate stage of the "regen" that creates a "gen" templat


[12/1/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
if you run the regenerate header template it just immediately inserts the new header

{Reactions}
👍

[12/1/2023 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
That is all pushed


[12/1/2023 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
let me know if you see bugs


[12/1/2023 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
Dana is working tomorrow and Zachary has rehersal so I might spent some time on taelgar stuff


[12/1/2023 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
btw, I think your human culture doc is good but I'm not sure if there is "too much" going on in some of these places


[12/1/2023 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
but more later, going to eat dinner


[12/1/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
one small thing - i'd probably make the default option be to show prepositions, and have the format spec remove prepositions. it is kind of annoying to have to add q anytime you overwrite a format spec in whereabouts


[12/1/2023 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense


[12/1/2023 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a few display issues but probably not going to mess around tonight. 

currently unknown is weird, needs a fix
events not having the "Happened in: " or similar makes single date events look quite awkward ("DR 1059 - 1059, 0 years)
I don't necessarily think the default should be not to show page dated info for places/items (e.g. Destroyed in Year)


[12/1/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
ah guess default is display "destroyed in" just need to clean up endstatus stuff when it doesn't make sense "A consumed by Cha'mutte's plague city in ..."


[12/1/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, mostly not doing this tonight


[12/1/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
just a few notes


[12/1/2023 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
If you give me some pages that are messy I’ll look at some cleanup tomorrow afternoon


[12/2/2023 7:46 AM] rsulfuratus
a few bug reports, more explicit.


[12/2/2023 7:46 AM] rsulfuratus
1. Unknown Location bug
Currently Unknown looks weird to me; to fix it however probably requires going back to an "unknown" displayDefault for wCurrent, which isn't really that bad. haven't implemented in case you have a different clever idea. Should probably be Current Location: Unknown. 

Alton Greenleaf is a good "unknown location" test case


[12/2/2023 7:58 AM] rsulfuratus
2. Event display cleanup
(The Battle of Urlich Pass is a test case)

Generally speaking, I think that the header for events is generally not great, but it is a bit hard to fix strictly with defaults. 

Events with DR but no DR_end should not display imputed end, e.g. they should be:
"Happened in DR 1059"
not
"DR 1059 - DR 1059, lasted 0 years"

Conversely, events with defined start and end with a length <1 year should still display. For some reason War of the Cloak just shows ended, not span. 

Even more complicated, I would generally think that for events with location and a single date, you probably want:
"Happened in <date> in <loc>"
whereas events with start and end you want:
"<start> - <end>"
"Happened in <loc>"

There might be a few more event display issues but these are the main ones. 

War of the Cloak and Battle of Urlich Pass are my test cases here


[12/2/2023 8:12 AM] rsulfuratus
3. Reusing endStatus in the whereabouts line for places might not be the best default, since endStatus if often how they are destroyed, e.g. Isingue. You can override it, of course, so this is just more about defaults, whether it is easier to set wPastHome to something different when you change endStatus or to add endStatus when you want it

Isingue is a test case I have customized, but which looks bad with the default wPastHome. 

But this might be fine to leave


[12/2/2023 8:15 AM] rsulfuratus
4. Preposition defaults. The best case scenario here would be introduce Q for no prepositions, and then have q/Q be "sticky" - if you have a q, it is not overriden in a whereabouts format spec unless you give Q, and if you have Q same unless you give q. 

So if the default is wHome: "Based <home:3qr>" then you set "format: f" you still get prepositions, it is only if you set "format: fQ" that you don't.


[12/2/2023 8:16 AM] rsulfuratus
that is what I've seen so far, but generally it is quite nice


[12/2/2023 8:36 AM] rsulfuratus
another minor thing about prefixes: the Dunmari who are based in locations like "the plains north east of Karawa" are a bit awkward at the moment, not sure whether there is code changes or just format string changes for these. E.g., Akan


[12/2/2023 8:40 AM] .deciusmus
How are they awkward?


[12/2/2023 8:41 AM] rsulfuratus

[12/2/2023 8:41 AM] rsulfuratus
the arrangement of articles and prepositions is wrong


[12/2/2023 8:41 AM] .deciusmus
Ah


[12/2/2023 8:41 AM] rsulfuratus
should be something like: "Based in the north-eastern plains of Karawa"


[12/2/2023 8:42 AM] rsulfuratus
partly this is caused by default prep being ""


[12/2/2023 8:42 AM] .deciusmus
It’s tricky because if then prefix was “sailing to” it would work


[12/2/2023 8:42 AM] .deciusmus
Ah, no


[12/2/2023 8:43 AM] .deciusmus
I optimized for the halfling boats where you have a location chain


[12/2/2023 8:43 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. person is on boat sailing to place


[12/2/2023 8:44 AM] .deciusmus
Or alternatively the currently case


[12/2/2023 8:44 AM] rsulfuratus
right, the problem i think is the concept of prefix is a bit loosely defined to make it worth well with automatic prepositions


[12/2/2023 8:44 AM] .deciusmus
Ie traveling to,
You get currently traveling to Embry


[12/2/2023 8:45 AM] rsulfuratus
location status, location subpart, and approximate location are all overloaded into prefix and it gets complicated because the article/preposition needs differ


[12/2/2023 8:45 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[12/2/2023 8:46 AM] rsulfuratus
the easiest option is probably actually the display alias option


[12/2/2023 8:46 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[12/2/2023 8:48 AM] .deciusmus
That solves the “sub part” case


[12/2/2023 8:48 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for Akan simplest option would be:
- {type: home, location: Eastern Dunmar, display: "plains north-east of Karawa" }


[12/2/2023 8:48 AM] .deciusmus
And the approximate I guess


[12/2/2023 8:49 AM] rsulfuratus
technically the prefix is just a complicated preposition in some ways


[12/2/2023 8:50 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if a ship were "trapped in the Whirlpool of Death"


[12/2/2023 8:50 AM] rsulfuratus
then really you are replacing the "in" in a wherabout-specific way


[12/2/2023 8:50 AM] rsulfuratus
so someone on the ship should be: "Currently on Black Pearl, trapped in the Whirlpool of Death"


[12/2/2023 8:51 AM] rsulfuratus
so probably having display alias and prefix works fine, where prefix is just a simple way to override the entire preposition for a whereabout


[12/2/2023 8:53 AM] rsulfuratus
again I think a general standarded name object would probably make a lot of this much simpler


[12/2/2023 9:04 AM] .deciusmus
You actually want the prepositions to be able to vary based on type, it the mirror of soul trapping should be able to have a “trapped in” for people, stored on for items, and in for places


[12/2/2023 9:08 AM] rsulfuratus
but "Stormcaller Tower" has a different preposition for different people "imprisoned in" vs "in" so it isn't quite that simple


[12/2/2023 9:08 AM] rsulfuratus
that could be a nice way to generate defaults, though


[12/2/2023 9:10 AM] .deciusmus
Right that’s where the prefix comes in


[12/2/2023 9:10 AM] .deciusmus
Or maybe you actually get rid of prefix and just have a display alias


[12/2/2023 9:12 AM] .deciusmus
So if you don’t have a locationAlias it displays as 
calculated preposition article place

If you do it just displays the alias


[12/2/2023 9:13 AM] .deciusmus
The one thing that doesn’t work for is “traveling to X” because you’d like the chain to come from the X not the location


[12/2/2023 9:13 AM] .deciusmus
It would be pretty simple to allow aliases for unknown as well


[12/2/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
still think a generalized name object would make this a lot simpler. you could have something like a locChain property that would let you follow the chain from a different place, for example


[12/2/2023 9:16 AM] rsulfuratus
so "traveling to Tokra" could be:
file: Dunmar
locChain: Tokra
displayText: traveling to Tokra


[12/2/2023 9:21 AM] rsulfuratus
basically any string can be decomposed to:
file: the thing it actually represents, or null if unknown
display: the text to show

where display can be autogenerated based on prepositions and articles, or just overwritten entirely 

you need a few more bells and whistles to handle linking (e.g., you don't want traveling to Tokra to link to Dunmar), and perhaps things like locChain to calculate parts from a different file than file and a few other tweaks


[12/2/2023 9:23 AM] rsulfuratus
the string formatter then could just do: <prefix><article><name><suffix>


[12/2/2023 9:24 AM] rsulfuratus
so default would be something like:


[12/2/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
Currently on the Emerald Song


[12/2/2023 9:25 AM] rsulfuratus
where "Emerald Song" is:
file: Emerald Song
prefix: on
article: the


[12/2/2023 9:27 AM] rsulfuratus
but, you could then imagine a lot more stuff. for example, suffix could be ", a typeof"
so you get:
Currently on the Emerald Song, a boat
Currently at The Red Lily, an inn in Tokra, Central Dunmar


[12/2/2023 9:29 AM] rsulfuratus
Currently sailing on the Emerald Song, a halfing ship


[12/2/2023 9:31 AM] rsulfuratus
Or if you have different display text, you could have:
file: Central Dunmar
display: plains south of Tokra
locChain: Tokra
prefix: camped on
art: the

You get:
Camped on the plains south of Tokra, Central Dunmar, Dunmar


[12/2/2023 9:33 AM] rsulfuratus
or in that case maybe it is easier to include the article in the display text, e.g. "the plains south of Tokra", art: ""


[12/2/2023 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
still need to figure out exactly the details and implementation, but I think this would be way simpler than increasingly complicated string formatter commands for display overrides and such


[12/2/2023 9:35 AM] .deciusmus
Where are you imagining you are providing this name object? In the whereabouts line?


[12/2/2023 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
i think it would be constructed from any string. but overrides would come from whereabouts lines mostly I think, yes. 

e.g., location: <string> 

<string> gets processed by getNormalizedName to generate the name object

location: <string>, prefix: imprisoned in

gets processed by getNormalizedName but with prefix: imprisoned in instead of default


[12/2/2023 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
I understand the idea of having a normalized name object for a file (although I'm not actually sure what you ever want to do with the name object other than display it)


[12/2/2023 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
And I gues it is easier to think about if the idea is that you have some definition of a name and then you can override pieces on a whereabouts line if you want the name to be generated differently


[12/2/2023 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
But something like locChain is not part of a name


[12/2/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
i think normalized name is not a property of a file, it is a property of a string


[12/2/2023 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
it's not a normalized representation of a note, it is a normalized representation of a bit of text, so it is basically all about display


[12/2/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
sure but in that case I don't know what you do with it other than display it


[12/2/2023 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
all you do is display it, yes


[12/2/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
so what's the point of having all the properties, any consumer of it is only going to want the string representation


[12/2/2023 9:41 AM] .deciusmus
I can't see why, say, string formatter would ever want to access name.article


[12/2/2023 9:43 AM] rsulfuratus
because in some contexts you might not want to display name.article


[12/2/2023 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
sure, but that's just semantics


[12/2/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. is it better to have the "a" format string interpreted by string formatter, by calculating the name display string, or have name code decide based on an input


[12/2/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
it isn't visible to the user


[12/2/2023 9:44 AM] rsulfuratus
well, okay, i guess my main point is the string formatter codes are not sufficient. e.g., for variable prefixes, for display alias text, etc


[12/2/2023 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
I do think that there should be a method on name manager, something like getLocationChainName(previousLocation, nextLocation)


[12/2/2023 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
The key point I guess is that generating the location chain and generating the name are two different things, and that generating a name in a location chain is more complex


[12/2/2023 9:46 AM] .deciusmus
So for example the casing and linking format codes work quite well for things like typeof, etc


[12/2/2023 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
but the "following the chain" string format commands (current, home, origin, lastknown) have a bunch of additional complexity to get them perfect which is not well covered right now


[12/2/2023 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
display aliases, variable prefixes, etc are not really part of a name, they are part of a location chain


[12/2/2023 9:52 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess my feeling is that the "location chain" concept is more widely useful.


[12/2/2023 9:53 AM] .deciusmus
but where?


[12/2/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
and also that at least 50% of pages really just need a good information box so it is worth the time to clean it up


[12/2/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
events, for one


[12/2/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
although i guess that is more just that whereabouts are generally useful


[12/2/2023 9:54 AM] .deciusmus
events and organizations have the idea of "part of" as distinct from whereabouts


[12/2/2023 9:54 AM] .deciusmus
which probably does need a bit of thought


[12/2/2023 9:54 AM] .deciusmus
and is logically similar


[12/2/2023 10:01 AM] .deciusmus
I also do think there is this idea of "the name as part of a chain" as distinct from "the name itself"


[12/2/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
there are really three concepts that we are dealing with:
* the source page
* the target "page" (which might not exist)
* the link between them

What you'd like is to have a general function like getChainedDisplayName(source, target, linkInfo)

which would then generate a string like:

owned by the Dunmar Fellowship
or
Chardon
or
a battle in the War of the Cloak
or
an inn on the Tokra-Darba Road


[12/2/2023 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
or
on the plains east of Karawa


[12/2/2023 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
the problem is, in general, it is tricky to define generic rules that always work


[12/2/2023 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
the simple case is something like:

<prep of target> <name of target>


[12/2/2023 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
or really <prep of target if different from prep of source> <name of target>


[12/2/2023 10:07 AM] .deciusmus
allowing you to specify the format string, not for the entire chain but for this specific link might work pretty well though


[12/2/2023 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
no, it gets confusing... let me keep thinking


[12/2/2023 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus
I don't think that names in chains and names out of chains are really that different, you just have a chain length of 1


[12/2/2023 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
Strings are basically:
<prefix><name><prep><prefix><name><prep> etc


[12/2/2023 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
where prep is really shorthand for "linker text"


[12/2/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
well, but there are two contexts for names


[12/2/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. in a table of "people in Cleenseau" I don't want to see "linker text" at all


[12/2/2023 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
in headers though you probably do...

i.e. in a header it is pretty much always

<description of line><context><article><prefix><name><linktext><context><article><prefix><name> etc


[12/2/2023 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
and in fact, "description of link" is really just a link text as well


[12/2/2023 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
so you can think of it as

So for example if you have

Sword of Power owned by Anontia in the Mirror of Soul Trapping on Vindijsjtra piloted by the Dunmar Fellowship travelling across the plains of Central Dunmar, Dunmar


[12/2/2023 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
you have a sequence of pages:
[Sword of Power] -> [Antonia] -> [Mirror] etc


[12/2/2023 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
you want to display a line that is basically

<link text: Sword of Power To Antonia><context: Antonia><article: Antonia><prefix: Antonia><name: Antonia><linktext: Antonia to Mirror> etc


[12/2/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
relatedly, I think it is also much better to define the default link stuff in page metadata, than in metadata.json

e.g., if I have ancestry: Urskan

I shouldn't need to add an entry in metadata.json


[12/2/2023 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not entirely sure why we don't just use an alias for this, like why not just have Sembaran be an alias for Sembara?


[12/2/2023 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah I had that same though a while ago


[12/2/2023 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
The link map should in theory be obsolete at this point


[12/2/2023 11:26 AM] rsulfuratus
having a way to indicate paths (traveling to, etc) could also be very useful for rivers. e.g., a lot of rivers have just one line of text, describing a source. 

having an autogenerated:
Flows from <source> to <outflow>, passing <place1>, <place2>

might be nice

or might be overkill when you can just type that in the text


[12/2/2023 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
A few updates:

locationAlias, in a whereabout line, works well. It is basically an alias for that location and it doesn't overwrite article or prep. It **does** work for unknown locations.

So:

- {type: home, start: 1051, end: 1582, locationAlias: wandering and hiding}

Means that this is an "unknown" location but it displays as "Currently wandering and hiding" rather than Currently Unknown


[12/2/2023 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
Prefix works with locationAlias as an override to the "link text" basically, so:

{type: home, start: 940, end: 1050, prefix: in, locationAlias: parts unknown}

Displayas as "Currently in parts unknown"


[12/2/2023 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the ideally the prefix would only display if the format string had "q", so that if it was an origin location it would show as

Originally from: parts unknown


[12/2/2023 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
Similarly, 

- {type: home, location: plains of Karawa, locationAlias: plains north-east of Karawa, format: "3" }

Shows

[12/2/2023 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
The locationAlias is not meant to solve all problems, but it gives a handy way to change the description of a location and is analogous to typeOfAlias and speciesAlias


[12/2/2023 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
basically cases where you want a *local*, rather than *global*, alias for a real thing, or you need an alias for a page that doesn't exist


[12/2/2023 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
(but you don't want the "location" to be the page that doesn't exist because you want to be able to search for that specific location)


[12/2/2023 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i think this is fine, and probably a useful exercise, but generally speaking it is hard to tell if it is worth investing a lot in cleaning up display text (as opposed to just cleaning up actual metadata)


[12/2/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., I'm not convinced this stuff feels mature enough yet


[12/2/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
well, the alias works well for the case where you don't think "the plains north east of kawara" should be a place


[12/2/2023 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
(because "the plains of karawa" is the place, and you don't want to make more specific types of places within the plains of karawa)


[12/2/2023 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that isn't really my point though. i don't particularly care whether Akan's bio box is ungrammatical, I mean this is a super minor NPC who weirdly has a lot of information


[12/2/2023 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
doesn't that contradict what you said 2 hours ago? 😄


[12/2/2023 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
when you said it was worth spending time to get the boxes correct?


[12/2/2023 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
the point of pointing out bugs is to identify structural issues with how we process metadata, then come up with a stable fix, then clean them up


[12/2/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i feel like the process of "fix each edge case with another layer" is going to end up with an unmaintainable mess


[12/2/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
hence, pointing out bugs doesn't imply they need to be fixed immediately


[12/2/2023 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
sorry if that wasn't clear


[12/2/2023 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
it means: there is an aspect of our current strategy that doesn't capture this case well


[12/2/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I think the idea of an alias actually captures this case perfectly


[12/2/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
A better example is Hralgar


[12/2/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
His current location is unknown


[12/2/2023 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
But it should display as “drifting on the wind”


[12/2/2023 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
Using that as a prefix for taelgar is a hack


[12/2/2023 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[12/2/2023 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
And overriding wCurrentU for Hralgar is wrong as well because it wouldn’t work if you wanted to have an item owned by him


[12/2/2023 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the general idea that we want to be able to control the display alias of pages (including "unknown" or other generic things) in a context-specific way is definitely crucial to making things work


[12/2/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
I think in general the idea of being able to say “this is an unknown location but it should display like this” and also “this is a known location but it should display like this”


[12/2/2023 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
this is what I've been arguing for with a standardized name


[12/2/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
Is useful


[12/2/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I don't disagree


[12/2/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
I don’t think it’s a name though


[12/2/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
but are you convinced that the current implementation is definitely the best way to do it?


[12/2/2023 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
well, sure, standardized string


[12/2/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
But going to eat lunch, more later

[12/2/2023 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
So looking at this some more, I really am not sure that the issue or problem is really related to whether there is a normalized name object or not


[12/2/2023 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
the onenote importer is amazing


[12/2/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
I just don't see that as a useful model for solving any particular problems. I do think that it is very useful to have

(a) a generalized function that takes a page and returns the "name" of that page (which takes into account titles, prefixes, articles, linking, casing, aliases)
(b) a generalized function that takes a *source* and a *target* and returns the "relationship text" between those two pages

At the moment, we have (a) via the nameManager.getName, but the format string is overloaded in an unfortunate way. I strongly believe that format strings are a good way to separate display instructions from the metadata itself, but it is not ideal that the chain-following logic and the formating logic are intermixed


[12/2/2023 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
what you really want is:
* a format string that specifies how you generate the name for something
* a filter that defines which pieces of a chain you output
* a link format string that species how you link a and b in a chain


[12/2/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I think if I was refactoring I'd be tempted to try to split the format and the filter, but I'm not sure it is really actually worthwhile


[12/2/2023 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
because the current code is pretty simple for managing that


[12/2/2023 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not sure that a normalized name object is the right implementation. but the problem is there are too many ways to set display options, and different display parts have different ways to set them. the shear number of format strings and display defaults makes them hard to efficiently use


[12/2/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. My basic instinct is that display defaults are at some level wrong


[12/2/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
I gotta go take Z to rehersal then I am going to mess around with this for real for a bit


[12/2/2023 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
eh actually onenote importer is uselessly buggy, will have to try again in a month or so


[12/2/2023 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
oh well


[12/2/2023 1:44 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, here is my take on the string formatting stuff. i have a bunch of other projects to work on today so don't have a ton of time to mess around with this.


[12/2/2023 1:44 PM] rsulfuratus
fundamentally, I think the ultimate goal is that we want (a) structured metadata that can be used for querying notes, that (b) can be converted into nice-looking info boxes for each page automatically, which (b1) allows a good fraction of TaelgarVerse to be autogenerated from metadata, and (b2) helps keep key summary information readily visible


[12/2/2023 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
for (a), structured metadata needs to be (i) accurate, (ii) easily querable, and (iii) use at least a semi-controlled vocabulary


[12/2/2023 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
for (b), display control needs to be flexible enough to allow page-specific overrides, while general enough to allow most autogenerated pages to look good enough to not require manual editing


[12/2/2023 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
the problem I feel like we are in right now is that we have a lot of bells and whistles for display control, but (i) they are very inconsistent (e.g., to add startStatus to Originally from: requires overwriting wOrigin but endStatus is built into wPastHome),  (ii) things like approximate locations are mixed up with display control, and (iii) there is a lot of variability in where you need to change display variables to change the output, especially for "linking text" in chains


[12/2/2023 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
there is also a lot of complication with what is a property of a page in general, vs what is a property of a specific display element, which makes makes updating a lot of pages complicated


[12/2/2023 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
there is actually I think a fundamental complication which can be seen if we think about the whereabouts of a person like Dee Wildcloak


[12/2/2023 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
if a whereabouts line is supposed to mark known locations, then these lines should not exist:
- {type: away, start: 1748-03-20, end: 1748-04-22, location: traveling to Chardon}


[12/2/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
between 03/20 and 04/22, we don't know where Dee was


[12/2/2023 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
but we know she left Stormcaller Tower at on 3/19 and arrived in Chardon on 4/23


[12/2/2023 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
now, for Dee, it probably doesn't matter because it is unlikely we'll ever care her exact location on a specific date in the past


[12/2/2023 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but, if for example you later found out that there was another important item that Dee left stormcaller tower with, but that didn't make it to Chardon, then her exact route might turn out to matter


[12/2/2023 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
however, from a display point of view, we probably don't want Dee to show "unknown location" on 4/10


[12/2/2023 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
(again, doesn't really matter for Dee specifically)


[12/2/2023 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
because her location isn't totally unknown, it is "traveling from Stormcaller Tower to Chardon by some unknown route"


[12/2/2023 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
Right but that’s a problem of representation I haven’t tackled yet


[12/2/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I know, I'm just saying I think it is fundamentally related


[12/2/2023 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure solving how to display "traveling to" information is worthwhile in isolation, that is


[12/2/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not sure I agree. Look at the “travelling in Dunmar” line of Dee


[12/2/2023 2:07 PM] .deciusmus
In that case the word prefix is wrong but it’s basically overriding the preposition


[12/2/2023 2:07 PM] .deciusmus
It makes perfect sense - Dee is in Dunmar, but adding some color commentary for display is useful


[12/2/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so, that is fine, but if that is the solution I think it implies very strongly the following:
a location is the most specific target note that captures the physical whereabouts of a source


[12/2/2023 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
that might be the right decision


[12/2/2023 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
I think that is true


[12/2/2023 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
Because that is what makes sense for queries


[12/2/2023 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
The only wrinkle is whether it is worth capturing movement separately


[12/2/2023 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
That definition has tradeoffs, for example traveling from Stormcaller Tower to Chardon crosses from Central Lowlands to West Coast


[12/2/2023 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
so the most specific target note for "traveling to Chardon" is "Taelgar"


[12/2/2023 2:11 PM] .deciusmus
That is, should a dataview query be able to distinguish between:

Person A is kinda aimlessly wandering around Dunmar

Person B is specifically traveling from point A to point B


[12/2/2023 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
But that’s correct. The only known location from a page perspective is Taelgar


[12/2/2023 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I'm not saying it is incorrect


[12/2/2023 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm saying it might not be the most useful way to structure information


[12/2/2023 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
Well I agree but I think the other alternative is a first class notion “type: travel”


[12/2/2023 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
One of the advantages of travel is it is easier to track stops and paths.


[12/2/2023 2:14 PM] .deciusmus
And it also works for roads and rivers


[12/2/2023 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
well, yes and no. a path that moves in time and a path that moves in space are not exactly equivalent


[12/2/2023 2:14 PM] .deciusmus
For our purposes I kinda think they are


[12/2/2023 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not convinced but would have to think about it a bit


[12/2/2023 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
My broader point is that I think the locationAlias and linkText concepts  solve all problems *except* traveling and the question of how to “start” the chain. 

The only time origin/home/etc matter is the link text from the page itself to the first part of the chain


[12/2/2023 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
Ie “originally from: “ is just the link between page X and the first location in the origin whereabout


[12/2/2023 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that makes sense


[12/2/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
So playing around a bit, I think there is basically no need to have wHome, wOrigin, etc. There was no current usage of them that isn't better solved with link text or better defaults. Also, the format on a whereabout isn't really used either, except for 2 things

(a) to force regions to appear when the whereabout doesn't make sense without regions
(b) to skip the first line in some cases


[12/2/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so, take a look at Morkalan which I just pushed


[12/2/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
(you might need to test on pageTargetDate: 1749)


[12/2/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
any edits should ideally make that kind of header generation easier, not harder


[12/2/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
in theory, all you should have to do is:

displayDefaults: {startStatus:  brought into being, endStatus: "destroyed by [[Riswynnn]] and companions" }


[12/2/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
the rest of it is, I think, just bad defaults


[12/2/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
places are going to be more of a mess because we haven't really thought about what the defaults should be


[12/2/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
In particular, I think places and organizations, unlike people, shouldn't have a separate origin and created lines


[12/2/2023 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
constrast with Isingue


[12/2/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
which kind of works with: `displayDefaults: {endStatus: Consumed by Cha'mutte's plague in, wPastHome: "<subtypeof:UA> <typeof:UA> <(of )primary> <current:5q>, once part of <origin:rA>\n<end> <target>", dPast: ""}`


[12/2/2023 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
with: `whereabouts:
- {type: home, location: Istabor Alliance}
- {type: home, start: 1545, location: Plaguelands, format: Fq}`


[12/2/2023 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
which you could probably clean up a bit


[12/2/2023 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
but since they are incompatible you need a way to have fine control over the actual strings displayed


[12/2/2023 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
probably wHome, wOrigin, all that isn't the right way


[12/2/2023 3:25 PM] rsulfuratus
this is cleaner for Isingue: 
`displayDefaults: {endStatus: Consumed by Cha'mutte's plague in, wOrigin: "<subtypeof:UA> <typeof:UA> <(of )primary> <current:Fq>, once part of <origin:rA>", wPastHome: "<end> <target>", dPast: ""}`


[12/2/2023 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
but, that doesn't work perfectly for dates prior to 1545, since now you get: "An Isinguer ruined city in the Istabor Alliance"


[12/2/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
which is mostly driven by "ruined" as a subtype being a permanent, and not time-dependent, property of the page


[12/2/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe not worth fixing


[12/2/2023 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
you can fix if it you really want like so:
```
---
headerVersion: 2023.11.25
tags: [place, status/unknown, testcase]
displayDefaults: {endStatus: Consumed by Cha'mutte's plague in, wOrigin: "A <primary:UA> <ancestry> <typeof:UA> <home:Fq>, once part of <origin:rA>", wPastHome: "<end> <target>", dPast: ""}
campaignInfo: []

pageTargetDate: 1542

---
```


[12/2/2023 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
one could imagine taking this to the extreme and basically making ALL descriptors be page-dated. even species might change if someone cases reincarnate on you.


[12/2/2023 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
you could have a standard format like:
- { label, start, end } 
and then just a default string processor that converts bare strings to { label: string, start: 0001, end: 9999 }


[12/2/2023 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
it makes dataview queries a bit more complicated because if you care about the page-dated value you need to use a dataviewjs function


[12/2/2023 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
it might be overkill


[12/2/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but also might unlock a lot of format simplification


[12/2/2023 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, to summarize:
- the current approach as is is extremely powerful and allows construction of essentially arbitrary page headers if you understand the quirks, albeit in some kind of complicated ways that often involve using metadata a little suboptimally
- it is likely that there is a way to simplify by abstracting some of the linkText and linkAlias ideas and perhaps combining with a way to get the description of something at time X, or other ideas
- the simplification may be fun and useful to play around with but (a) should probably be done on a branch and (b) should not remove the customization power of the current approach, it should just make it simpler to use and more consistent


[12/2/2023 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
- separately for query purposes it is worth thinking about stuff like approximate locations and path-style locations


[12/2/2023 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
So, spending 30 minutes entering data for places, I am starting to wonder if the whole concept of overloading everything into whereabouts is correct


[12/2/2023 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
For example I was looking at inns in Tokra. There really isn’t a good way to record who built an inn


[12/2/2023 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
Technically you can by putting origin as person and setting the location of a person at the founding date to the current location and the overwriting the display strings


[12/2/2023 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
But this isn’t really great because for a place, “origin” might mean:
- the founder / builder 
- the political “part of” for a time in the past
- a geographic location that doesn’t currently exist


[12/2/2023 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
There is an argument that overloading whereabouts for item owners was a mistake


[12/2/2023 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
However, I also feel like this is moving too fast 🙂


[12/2/2023 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
What I really wanted to do is get the basic structure of whereabouts for representing actual locations of things finalized


[12/2/2023 4:47 PM] .deciusmus
To that end, I was going to propose the following mini-spec

A whereabouts line has the following properties:

* type: home or away
* location: the target page / target place the person/vehicle/etc is in. This is the place that will return true when asked "is the person in this place"
* alias: used as an alternative display for the location. works even if the location is empty (meaning "unknown")
* filter: the filter string (f, 1-2, 2-,  etc) for filtering whereabouts from here onward
* format: a format string to pass to string formatter to format this specific whereabout
* linkText: a string to join the previous whereabout to this one


[12/2/2023 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
the default format is: <name:q>


[12/2/2023 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
sorry that is wrong. q goes away


[12/2/2023 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
the default format is <name>


[12/2/2023 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
the default link text is the link text from the target page


[12/2/2023 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
whereabouts would no longer support wOrigin etc. I don't think those make sense


[12/2/2023 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
(the display defaults for the PAGE still would)


[12/2/2023 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
you don't think there is use in "generate this specific display string only if this location is the origin?"


[12/2/2023 4:51 PM] .deciusmus
No


[12/2/2023 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
well, I guess wOrigin specifically is a bit silly


[12/2/2023 4:52 PM] .deciusmus
I think you might set link Text differently


[12/2/2023 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I don't really understand exactly what you are proposing


[12/2/2023 4:53 PM] rsulfuratus
the problem is something like linkText depends on whether something is origin or home


[12/2/2023 4:53 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., person born in 1715, lived in Cleenseau until 1725, moved to Tollen


[12/2/2023 4:53 PM] .deciusmus
does it? in practice the usages I've seen don't really


[12/2/2023 4:54 PM] rsulfuratus
in 1749, that should be:
"originally from: Cleenseau"
"based in Tollen"


[12/2/2023 4:54 PM] rsulfuratus
in 1720 presumably you don't want:
"Originally from: Cleenseau"


[12/2/2023 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
think of it this way.

the format tokens <home>, <current>, <origin>, and <lastknown> all generate the same string


[12/2/2023 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
the different is the wOrigin string


[12/2/2023 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
so if the page has

wOrigin: "Originally from: <origin>"


[12/2/2023 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
that would generate the same string as

wOrigin: "Originally from: <home>"

except that the actual selected whereabouts would be different


[12/2/2023 4:55 PM] rsulfuratus
ah so you aren't using linkText as the "Oriignally from", "Based in" part


[12/2/2023 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
No


[12/2/2023 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
not yet


[12/2/2023 4:56 PM] .deciusmus
conceptually, you might be able to do away with wOrigin if you could set the "originLinkText, homeLinkText, etc" in the display defaults of the page


[12/2/2023 4:56 PM] .deciusmus
At the moment, all I am triyng to do is define how the <origin> or <current> string gets built


[12/2/2023 4:56 PM] .deciusmus
But I'm not sure it is worth getting more complex because why not just set wOrigin on the page?


[12/2/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
So basically the idea is... given a page Q and a string <current|home|origin|lastknown> how to you generate the replacement value for <current|home|origin|lastknown>


[12/2/2023 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
My proposal is those 4 values are generated as follows:

starting from Q, select the correct whereabout from the list of whereabouts in Q. 

then the text you generate is something like

<link text> [[target|alias??target]]


[12/2/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
but with the ability to override that via a standard string format, so you could do something like

format: "<typeof> <ancestry> <name>"

which would use the target page's values


[12/2/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
q\Q and prepositions go aay, instead there is a <linkType> or <linkText>


[12/2/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
so the default format is actually <linkText> <name>


[12/2/2023 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
then if you want something complicated you can do 

<linkText> <ancestry:a> <subtype> <typeof> <name>


[12/2/2023 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
and you'd get

in an elven forest realm, Orelands


[12/2/2023 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I think the idea is very powerful


[12/2/2023 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
but I still think there is a subtlety either I'm missing or this doesn't capture


[12/2/2023 5:08 PM] rsulfuratus
although maybe actually making whereabouts represent an actual location always and separating out things like owner/maker/founder would be sufficient


[12/2/2023 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
For the most part, it works even if we don't do that


[12/2/2023 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
there are likely some subtle issues that depend on convention


[12/2/2023 5:09 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, okay, here is an example


[12/2/2023 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. for an item, if you assume that the home location type means owner and away means no owner, you can define

wHome: "Owned <home>"
wCurrent: "Currently <current>"


[12/2/2023 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
and it works


[12/2/2023 5:10 PM] .deciusmus
for places, it gets a bit murkier I suspect


[12/2/2023 5:10 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't looked


[12/2/2023 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
again, maybe I'm missing something, but here is an example
- {type: home, end: 1745, location: originalPlace }
what if you want that formatted differently when it is in the origin line vs when it is the last known line?


[12/2/2023 5:12 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. someone like Apollyon


[12/2/2023 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
but do you actually want it to be formatted differently?


[12/2/2023 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
what's the actual example


[12/2/2023 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean I haven't messed around with the possibilities yet


[12/2/2023 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but for example what if I want:
"Last known location: facing down Cha'mutte in Drankor, DR 1059"


[12/2/2023 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
"Originally from Drankor, the Drankorian Empire"


[12/2/2023 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
the format for the whereabout has to be different in the "origin" context and the "lastknown" context


[12/2/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
but, you don't want to set a page-wide "wLastKnown" to "facing down Cha'mutte in <lastknown>, <date>" because it only makes sense for that specific line


[12/2/2023 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
if the last known is something else ("utterly destroyed by The Dunmar Fellowship in the ruined city of Drankor")


[12/2/2023 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
it is also true for wParty (which is a bit of a special case)


[12/2/2023 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
I think that is overloading whereabouts too much


[12/2/2023 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean, one decision could be: this is not what the summary box is for


[12/2/2023 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
I actually am not sure I agree with that, I am just not sure it is what whereabouts is for


[12/2/2023 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
What you really want it

campaignInfo: { person: Cha'mutte, format: Faced down <person> in <current>, date: 1059 }


[12/2/2023 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
I think


[12/2/2023 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
and the wLastKnown: ""


[12/2/2023 5:20 PM] .deciusmus
broadly, I think you are looking for interactions or events, not whereabouts


[12/2/2023 5:20 PM] .deciusmus
and trying to overload whereabouts to include interactions or events is probably a mistake


[12/2/2023 5:20 PM] .deciusmus
Now, last known location is a bit funny, because it kinda is a flavor of event


[12/2/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/2/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually think it would make sense to actually never export last known


[12/2/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
it is just really useful information to be able to query and see


[12/2/2023 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but, that is a lot of data entry hassle


[12/2/2023 5:22 PM] .deciusmus
what is a lot of data entry hassle?


[12/2/2023 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
because you always need to have a campaignInfo line to show last known kind of information


[12/2/2023 5:22 PM] .deciusmus
well, not necessarily


[12/2/2023 5:22 PM] .deciusmus
it is actually more like the page date stuff


[12/2/2023 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
I think this is a bit separate from the original case though which was about chaining


[12/2/2023 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
I'm trying to solve the problem of halfling on a boat or whatever


[12/2/2023 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
which mostly works, but it has some weird bits


[12/2/2023 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
although I guess they mostly involve the mismatch between owner and location


[12/2/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not fully convinced that conditional whereabout formatting (format X when origin, format Y when home) is never useful, but I am convinced that trying to use whereabout formatting as a way to display significant events/interactions in the header box is not correct


[12/2/2023 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
if it is simpiler to refactor the code without conditional formatting, it seems fine to go that way, and then add it back if needed

[12/2/2023 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. this annoys me


[12/2/2023 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
well, that is exactly what I was talking about


[12/2/2023 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
conditional formatting based on what it is used for


[12/2/2023 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
but that isn't based on it is used for


[12/2/2023 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
well, in this case the solution is probably to set wParty differently in the "Imprisoned by" line


[12/2/2023 5:30 PM] .deciusmus
No, the thing that annoys me is the "by Dunmar Fellowship


[12/2/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
don't you just need to set the article?


[12/2/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
or is the issue that following the location chain somehow drops the article?


[12/2/2023 5:31 PM] .deciusmus
well, I want to be able to set the link text for Vindisjratan -> Dunmar Fellowship as "owned by"


[12/2/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
and potentially set the format to skip people


[12/2/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
I think this is all close to doable


[12/2/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
why are you ever following into Dunmar Fellowship from Vindristjarna?


[12/2/2023 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
because its the current location


[12/2/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
Vindristjarna's location is "Dunmar Fellowship"?


[12/2/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
aha


[12/2/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
its because the home is set to dufr


[12/2/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
you've been making it work nicely for you


[12/2/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
home is set because that is the only way to generate "Owned by: "


[12/2/2023 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
by setting the location


[12/2/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/2/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, but if I lazily set the page target date to 1750


[12/2/2023 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
the current location becomes Dunmar Fellowship


[12/2/2023 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
right but that is because of the fact that home is overloaded both as a location and as "owned by:"


[12/2/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if you had a separate "Current Owners: Dunmar Fellowship"


[12/2/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
then you could set home to "Stormcaller Tower"


[12/2/2023 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
and origin to unknown


[12/2/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
(with an end date for home as 1748 whenever)


[12/2/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
then in 1750 location would correctly be unknown


[12/2/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/2/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
and in 1720 location would correctly be Stormcaller Tower


[12/2/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
It is a good argument for having ownership by separate from whereabouts


[12/2/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
that said, there are still reasons for things to be "located in" organizations


[12/2/2023 5:36 PM] .deciusmus
but by default you'd like an item's whereabouts to be its owners whereabouts


[12/2/2023 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
unless it doesn't have an owner


[12/2/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/2/2023 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
so you do want to be able to set the location of an item to a person or an organization


[12/2/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
but how is that different than owner?


[12/2/2023 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
isn't the idea that the default whereabout for an item is "owner"


[12/2/2023 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
because an item can be somewhere that is not its owner while still being owned by that person, for one


[12/2/2023 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
but would that be a person


[12/2/2023 5:40 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, wouldn't that be something like

whereabouts:
- { location: xxx, type: away, start: xxx }
- { location: owner, type: home }


[12/2/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
the idea would be that you could set the owner, like:

- { owner: Dunmar Fellowshop, start: x, end: y}


[12/2/2023 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
then you could set the whereabouts to be:

whereabouts: owner

which just means the whereabouts of this item is whatever the owner is


[12/2/2023 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
At some level owned by is just an affiliation. It goes back to the ruledBy vs leaderOf issue


[12/2/2023 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
You don’t want to set on the owners page all the items they own


[12/2/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
Actually what you really want is a with tag


[12/2/2023 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
{ type: with, with: (some other page) }


[12/2/2023 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
Which just means for this period of time, the page is wherever that other page is


[12/2/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
That actually solves a lot of issues because if you have a group of people traveling around you can pick one and set the rest as with the other person


[12/2/2023 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
how is that different from just setting the location?


[12/2/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
You don’t get the intermediate person / whatever in the page


[12/2/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
And you correctly get unknown if the other person is unknown


[12/2/2023 5:50 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, but that is basically just a shorthand for "format:plo" or whatever is it not?


[12/2/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
Well, you won’t get unknown


[12/2/2023 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
(with the additional correct setting of unknown locations, which probably should always happen if the whereabouts of the target are unknown when you follow a chain)


[12/2/2023 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i would argue that is just a bug


[12/2/2023 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
if the location of something is a place with an unknown whereabout, the chain should be: "target, Unknown"


[12/2/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
But a place can’t have an unknown whereabout


[12/2/2023 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
The whereabout is the place. I don’t know what you mean


[12/2/2023 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
"The Lost Inn", an inn ~somewhere~ that can only be reached by teleportation


[12/2/2023 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Wizard Y is in "The Lost Inn"


[12/2/2023 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
there location should be: 
"The Lost Inn, Unknown"


[12/2/2023 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
(with nicer formatting)


[12/2/2023 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
but conceptually that is their location


[12/2/2023 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
and that would work if you explicitly made the location of the lost inn unknown by adding whereabouts: Unknown


[12/2/2023 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I just don't see why you need a special "with" type when you can exactly cover the use case with the current setup


[12/2/2023 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
I'm talking about the case of:

3 NPCs (A, B, C) travelling together


[12/2/2023 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
are you suggesting I set, on NPC B, type: away, location: A


[12/2/2023 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, why not?


[12/2/2023 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
format: p


[12/2/2023 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
although if you have a group traveling together for a while it might make sense for them to be an organization


[12/2/2023 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
this is how I was going to set up all my halfling families and such


[12/2/2023 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
it was the original use case for the "skip organizations/people" in the format specification


[12/2/2023 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
I think the main issue is that it doesn't handle unknown correctly


[12/2/2023 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
but that should be fixable without needing to invent a "with" type


[12/2/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think so, you can't distinguish


[12/2/2023 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. how do you tell the difference between "the next level has no location, so I stop" vs "the next level has no location, so I say my location is unknown"


[12/2/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
you can't just always output unknown or you get things like

Dunmar, the West Coast Region, Unknown


[12/2/2023 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
the idea behind with is it would actually be handled during whereabouts normalization, not during display


[12/2/2023 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
theoretically if everything is set properly you always end at Taelgar or Unknown


[12/2/2023 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Taelgar can't be unknown (although I guess technically you could always stop at one of [Echo Realms, Spiritual Realms, Energy Realms, Material Plane]


[12/2/2023 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe that is better because then you can have demiplanes in unknown locations


[12/2/2023 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
right I think I first saw this issue with fey realms


[12/2/2023 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
but it feels like a bunch of ugly special casing to me


[12/2/2023 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the special casing?


[12/2/2023 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
the chain termination


[12/2/2023 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
actually, in general, i think the location filters were a bit of a mistake


[12/2/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think it encourages representing everything under the sun as a whereabout, but that isn't really necessarily sensible


[12/2/2023 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
it is just what was working


[12/2/2023 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno, I'm not sure this is really what I want to be spending my energy on


[12/2/2023 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean, fair


[12/2/2023 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
but my basic argument for with is that 
* {type: with, person: Dunmar Fellowship, start: X, end Y }

is way more clear than

* { type: away, location: Dunmar Fellowship, start: X, end Y, format: plo }


[12/2/2023 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[12/2/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I think with is a good shorthand


[12/2/2023 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
and it encourages using whereabouts to represent locations in space


[12/2/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
but I guess my argument is there are plenty of gray areas


[12/2/2023 6:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so if for example I want to represent a person in one of Cha'mutte's shadow realms, is that "with" or "away"?


[12/2/2023 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I agree that it is good practice to have clear metadata that can be understood at a glance, and with helps a lot with that


[12/2/2023 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
but that also leaves problems


[12/2/2023 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
like how to dates work? if you set a start but not an end, does it behave like home or away?


[12/2/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
I think with is like home


[12/2/2023 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. no start = 0001, no end = 9999


[12/2/2023 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
the key thing about with is that it would elide the thing you are with


[12/2/2023 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
This feels a bit like going in circles. Eg Garret Tealeaf was with Charmhearts, but I don’t know if he still is,


[12/2/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
So now I’m back to using away


[12/2/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I think we have really different preferences with unknown information


[12/2/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I also really want to be able to record the minimally “known” information without having to fill out a ton of detail


[12/2/2023 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
So for example I want to be able to say: “Garret was with Charmhearts on 1748-11-12, but I’m not sure what happened after”


[12/2/2023 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
If I later update Charmhearts location without deciding it Garret is with them, I don’t want Garret’s location to update


[12/2/2023 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe you scry Ander Charmheart for some unknown reason and I just improvise a location. But you only see him and Calle in an inn together


[12/2/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
Now I want to record “charmhearts at X location on Y date, delwath scryed”


[12/2/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
But maybe I just invented a random inn and I don’t even know where it is yet.


[12/2/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
The inn should then have unknown whereabouts


[12/2/2023 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
basically my two goals with metadata are:
1) capture the minimal canonical information I need without having to invent details I'm not ready to
2) have Obsidian automatically tell me what other relevant canonical information exists


[12/2/2023 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so having all these densely interlinked pages should be *possible* but it shouldn't be *necessary*


[12/2/2023 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
which is not to say the idea of with is bad, I like that, but I guess I'd just be inclined to rethink a bit how everything is structured before jumping ahead to write another piece of special-parsing code


[12/2/2023 6:28 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe for example we should be revisiting the distinction between explicit "this is unknown" and implicit "this is blank so it is unknown"


[12/2/2023 6:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't know


[12/2/2023 6:29 PM] rsulfuratus
at some point when I have time I will probably look at this in code but I just can't write or understand javascript nearly as fast as you, so you have a tendency to generate new things before I can possibly grasp how you are representing old things


[12/2/2023 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, I've mostly been working on a photobook for Matt and Nancy for christmas this afternoon and haven't really been thinking about this too deeply, so some of this might not have been carefully thought out


[12/2/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I pushed some metadata brainstorming to MoC but now Kate and I are going out so won’t think about this more until tomorrow


[12/2/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
So, to circle back to the very simple thing I wanted to do, here is my proposal for new whereabouts, with examples.

whereabouts on a halfing:
- {type: home, location: Wave Dancer, format: "<linktext> <name>, <ancestry:a> <maintype>" }

next in chain, Wave Dancer:
- {type: away, start: 1748-09-30, end: 1748-10-11, location: sailing to Wahacha, startFilter: "2" }

Generates:
> Based on the Wave Dancer, a halfling boat, sailing to Wahacha, in the Vermillion Isles

---

If the date changes, the next in chain is:

- {type: away, start: 1748-10-12, end: 1748-10-14, location: Wahacha, linkText: at port in, startFilter: "2" }

Generates:
> Based on the Wave Dancer, a halfling boat, at port in Wahacha, in the Vermillion Isles

This is demonstrating two features: the format and the link text.


[12/2/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, you could do:

- {type: away, start: 1748-10-12, end: 1748-10-14, alias: main port of Wacahca, location: Wahacha, linkText: moored in, startFilter: "2" }

> Currently moored in the main port of Wacahca, in the Vermillion Isles


[12/2/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
There are basically four features this is demostrating:

1) startFilter. This replaces the old "format", and defines the filter (using the existing rules) *if the whereabout chain starts with this item*. The filter doesn't change as you go through the chain, so if the whereabouts chain starts somewhere else, this is ignored


[12/2/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
So for example Wave Dancer has a startFilter of "2", which eans that it only goes 2 in the chain (Wahacha, Vermillion Isles). but that filter has no impact on the location of the halfling on the boat


[12/2/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
This isn't really a functional change, but it makes the rules much more clear


[12/2/2023 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
2) format string. This is a format string for this particular whereabout.

So for example format: "<linktext> <name>, <ancestry:a> <maintype>" in the location: Wave Dancer whereabout means

* Pass that format string into string formatter, using all the usual rules, and use the return for *this piece of the chain*


[12/2/2023 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
i.e that generates on the Wave Dancer, a halfling boat


[12/2/2023 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
3) linkText override. By default, the linkText comes from the displayDefaults of the *target* page. So for example in this line:

{ type: home, location: The Red Lily Inn, format: "<linktext> <name>" }

The linktext comes from The Red Lily Inn's page (either the display default for the type, or an overridden one for the page)


[12/2/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
but if you specify it on the line, it gets overridden. So for example:

{ type: away, location: The Red Lily Inn, format: "<linktext> <name>", linkText: staying at }

Means that instead of using the default linkText from the Red Lily Inn, we use staying at


[12/2/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
Note that you could achieve the same thing via:

format: "staying at <name>"


[12/2/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
(the default format string is "<linktext> <name>")


[12/2/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
Finally, alias.

Alias is special, it replaces the name *inside the link*


[12/2/2023 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
So if you have

- {type: away, start: 1748-10-12, end: 1748-10-14, alias: main port of Wacahca, location: Wahacha, linkText: moored in, startFilter: "2" }

You get:

Currently moored in the [[main port of Wacahca]], in the Vermillion Isles


[12/2/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
The same thing could be achieved with format string like

format: "moorred in the main port of <name:x>" (x = no article)


[12/2/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
except that only Wacahca will be linked in that case


[12/2/2023 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
as opposed to main port of Wacaha being linked via an alias (i.e. technically it is Currently moored in the [[main port of Wacahca|Wacahca]], in the Vermillion Isles


[12/2/2023 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
that all seems really nice


[12/2/2023 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
The one thing I want to fix is the ability to have different default link text based on source and target types


[12/2/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
Because right now it generates 

In Cleenseau, in the Barony of Averil, in Sembara


[12/2/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
I’d like to be able to define the place-place link text as empty


[12/2/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
By default


[12/2/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing that I was doing for some places is setting it so that instead of "A city in Ursk" it is just "An Urskan city"


[12/2/2023 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
but if that is the middle part of a chain you don't necessarily want that behavior


[12/2/2023 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
Right,  but for that you are setting the wCurrent or wHome


[12/2/2023 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that is probably the correct way to do it


[12/2/2023 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
you can also achieve it was format strings in the current setup


[12/2/2023 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
Right those still work


[12/2/2023 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
But they only apply to the first element


[12/2/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
Ie the wHome on a whereabouts line replaces the wHome on a page when that whereabout is the home whereabout


[12/2/2023 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
But that has no impact on what happens if that whereabout is the second location in a chain


[12/2/2023 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so this: 
- {type: home, location: Ursk, format: f}
will only skip "Ursk" when that whereaout is displayed on the current page (which is existing behavior)


[12/2/2023 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, that makes sense


[12/2/2023 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah except I renamed format to startFilter


[12/2/2023 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
To make it clear that
(a) this is a filter - qxa etc are ignored 
(b) it only applies when this whereabout is the start of the chain


[12/2/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense


[12/2/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that


[12/2/2023 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
do things like the region filter / type filters still apply up the chain?


[12/2/2023 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
what if you put a person as the location but don't want that person to show up? you need something like P on the start chain right?


[12/2/2023 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
although this would ultimately be the use case for e.g. a "with" type


[12/2/2023 9:42 PM] .deciusmus
The start filter is carried all the way along


[12/2/2023 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
So if you have r in the startFilter you get no regions anywhere along the chain


[12/2/2023 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
can you still apply filters as part of format, e.g. wCurrent: Currently <current:r>?


[12/2/2023 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
Yes


[12/2/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
Those are the default start filter


[12/2/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
but presumably the startFilter overrides


[12/2/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
Yes


[12/2/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
if there is conflict


[12/2/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
Unless you have !


[12/2/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/2/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I will have to play around to see


[12/2/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but it sounds like a nice system


[12/2/2023 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
need to think about how it interacts with campaignInfo / lastknown a bit


[12/2/2023 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but perhaps that is not an issue if those will be handled in a different way


[12/2/2023 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess it is mostly an issue for campaignInfo lines. for example I wouldn't want to repeat "a halfling boat" every time Emerald Song shows up, just once. so for a person like Wella Brightmoon you might want:
- Based on the Wave Dancer, a halfling ship
- Met by Wellby on September 30th, 1748 on the Wave Dancer, sailing to Wahacha, the Vermillion Isles
- Last seen by Wellby on October 12th, 1748 on the Wave Dancer, at port in Wahacha, the Vermillion Isles


[12/2/2023 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, Kate is done ordering pjs so I


[12/2/2023 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
so I'm signing off. if you push this stuff I will play around tomorrow and get a better feel for it


[12/2/2023 10:18 PM] .deciusmus
pushed to  new-whereabouts


[12/3/2023 8:15 AM] rsulfuratus
the automatic link text for location chains that switch type is very nice. however, it is often the case you don't want link text for the first element in a chain. more specifically, you might want link text for a location if it is "current" but not if it is "origin"


[12/3/2023 8:22 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., this is incorrect:
Originally from: in Ainumarya, Central Highlands Region


[12/3/2023 8:22 AM] rsulfuratus
but this is correct (if I change page date)
Based in Ainumarya, Central Highlands Region


[12/3/2023 8:22 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that was on my list but I didn’t get to it. It’s because the lack of q in the format specifier is now ignored


[12/3/2023 8:23 AM] .deciusmus
It should mean “skip the first link text”


[12/3/2023 8:30 AM] rsulfuratus
right. i was looking at trying to do that, but getFormattedString doesn't know what part of the chain it is


[12/3/2023 8:31 AM] .deciusmus
Its slightly non-obvious, basically you need to set the default format string to <name> if the format doesn’t contain q


[12/3/2023 8:32 AM] .deciusmus
But actually it’s more than that, what I wanted to do was split the filter and the format.


[12/3/2023 8:32 AM] .deciusmus
And move the link text into name manager as what gets generated for q


[12/3/2023 8:32 AM] .deciusmus
And then pass the format string to the name


[12/3/2023 8:32 AM] rsulfuratus
I lookeda that too, but #getDescriptionForThisPiece doesn't have the format string


[12/3/2023 8:32 AM] .deciusmus
But I haven’t quite thought it all through


[12/3/2023 8:33 AM] rsulfuratus
need a string object


[12/3/2023 8:33 AM] rsulfuratus
😉


[12/3/2023 8:42 AM] .deciusmus
do you think it would be annoying to have a format specifier like:

```<current:a;b;c>```

a: filter
b: formatter for first part
c: formatter for all parts


[12/3/2023 8:44 AM] .deciusmus
so ```<current:2r;Q;x>```

would mean:

1. filter using 2r
2. apply the Q format to the first piece
3. apply the x format to all pieces


[12/3/2023 8:44 AM] .deciusmus
the "format" would be the format specifier for the name part, if not specified


[12/3/2023 8:45 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the format specifier is getting overloaded already


[12/3/2023 8:45 AM] .deciusmus
Would you prefer a wHomeFilter ?


[12/3/2023 8:45 AM] .deciusmus
or wHome being a complex type?


[12/3/2023 8:45 AM] .deciusmus
{ wHome: { format: } { filter: } }


[12/3/2023 8:46 AM] rsulfuratus
no, I think that is worse


[12/3/2023 8:47 AM] rsulfuratus
I would probably do something like <format:current:filter>


[12/3/2023 8:48 AM] rsulfuratus
although actually that might be annoying too


[12/3/2023 8:48 AM] rsulfuratus
hmm


[12/3/2023 8:48 AM] .deciusmus
so ```<Q:current:2r>``` ? that seems worse


[12/3/2023 8:48 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm trying to avoid <current:;;x>


[12/3/2023 8:48 AM] .deciusmus
so there is an argument for wHomeFilter etc


[12/3/2023 8:49 AM] .deciusmus
because actually, you *never* overload that on the page


[12/3/2023 8:49 AM] .deciusmus
because realistically you set the filter on the whereabout line


[12/3/2023 8:49 AM] .deciusmus
not the page level


[12/3/2023 8:49 AM] .deciusmus
it is really the "default start filter for this type"


[12/3/2023 8:49 AM] .deciusmus
it could even just be wDefaultStartFilter


[12/3/2023 8:50 AM] rsulfuratus
but not being able to generically filter <loc> strings will be super annoying in general, for anything other than specific whereabouts lines


[12/3/2023 8:50 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., for campaignInfo lines


[12/3/2023 8:51 AM] rsulfuratus
which are often repetitive and so might want different filters


[12/3/2023 8:56 AM] .deciusmus
I dunno, looking at the current data the only place it is used is to cause one of Dee Wildcloaks lines to not show "Thirsty Scholar, Chardon, Chardonian Empire"


[12/3/2023 8:56 AM] .deciusmus
(but to just show "Thirsty Scholar, Chardon")


[12/3/2023 8:57 AM] rsulfuratus
but the current state is not reflective of the final stage, because things are in flux enough that I usually don't invest time in formatting


[12/3/2023 8:57 AM] .deciusmus
I actually there there is a different problem, which is that you don't want to be constantly repeating the same location information in th header


[12/3/2023 8:58 AM] rsulfuratus
I usually fiddle with one or two pages to see how things work


[12/3/2023 8:58 AM] .deciusmus
that is, it isn't so much that you want a specific different filter for met by party as you don't want to see the same string repeated over and over again


[12/3/2023 9:00 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, but some kind of filter on repetition is going to be way trickier than just giving direct control over location filters for each line


[12/3/2023 9:00 AM] .deciusmus
sure, but I don't think there is any good way to do locationfilters for each line other than

```<current:filter;format>```


[12/3/2023 9:01 AM] rsulfuratus
just because we are running out of letters?


[12/3/2023 9:01 AM] .deciusmus
oh, you want to keep them intermingled?


[12/3/2023 9:01 AM] .deciusmus
The problem is that I want the startfilter to override the *filter* but not the *format*


[12/3/2023 9:02 AM] .deciusmus
and I need to know which part of the format should apply to *all* pieces vs just the *first* piece


[12/3/2023 9:02 AM] .deciusmus
I could just split


[12/3/2023 9:02 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. take

3rqa

the code knows that r and 3 are filter and q and a are format


[12/3/2023 9:02 AM] .deciusmus
so it could just built 2 values from the one string


[12/3/2023 9:02 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/3/2023 9:02 AM] .deciusmus
but that is kinda annoying and inprecise to me


[12/3/2023 9:03 AM] .deciusmus
and to me it feels harder to read


[12/3/2023 9:03 AM] rsulfuratus
<current:2rP;Uq> is nice to me; <current:;q> is not


[12/3/2023 9:04 AM] rsulfuratus
so what I would do is write a format parser function that splits on `;` and then deconvoltes if there is no `;`


[12/3/2023 9:05 AM] rsulfuratus
and possibly fixes errors, e.g. if you have <current:q;2> it fixes it


[12/3/2023 9:13 AM] .deciusmus
eh, see writing a format parser in C# sounds like fun; Javascript not so much


[12/3/2023 9:13 AM] .deciusmus
I was just going to make regex groups for the parts, which is tolerable


[12/3/2023 9:14 AM] rsulfuratus
your refusal to engage with regexs is kind of breaking down


[12/3/2023 9:14 AM] .deciusmus
I know


[12/3/2023 9:14 AM] .deciusmus
its sad


[12/3/2023 9:15 AM] .deciusmus
handling the simple case of

```<current:q>```

is pretty easy


[12/3/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
i will try to get chatgpt to write a format parser


[12/3/2023 9:15 AM] .deciusmus
heh


[12/3/2023 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
the question is what an ideal format parser would return


[12/3/2023 9:15 AM] .deciusmus
{ format: x, filter: y }


[12/3/2023 9:16 AM] .deciusmus
parseFormat(input, validFilterChars, validFormatChars)

returns

{ format: x, filter: y }

or undefined if the string cant be parsed


[12/3/2023 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
here you go:
```javascript
function parseTokenString(input, filterChars, formatChars) {

    // Initial structure of the result
    let result = {
        token: null,
        filter: null,
        format: null
    };

    // Check if the input is in the expected format
    if (input.startsWith("<") && input.endsWith(">")) {
        let innerContent = input.slice(1, -1).split(":");
        
        if (innerContent.length === 1) {
            // Case for only token
            result.token = innerContent[0];
        } else if (innerContent.length === 2) {
            // Case for token with filter and format
            result.token = innerContent[0];
            let initialFormat = innerContent[1].split(";");

            // Separate filter and format based on allowable characters
            let filter = "";
            let format = "";

            for (let formatString of initialFormat) {
                for (let char of formatString) {
                    if (filterChars.includes(char)) filter += char;
                    if (formatChars.includes(char)) format += char;
                }
            }

            result.filter = filter;
            result.format = format;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

```


[12/3/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
not guaranteed to be bug-free


[12/3/2023 9:53 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not fluent enough with javascript to see at a glance


[12/3/2023 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
I have 2 hours while kate and kids are at church, i'm messing around with a new token parser structure. fine if it doesn't end up being useful. i pushed a basic, not working and very incomplete (mostly auto-generated by copilot) template as tokenParser.js


[12/3/2023 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
I just pushed my version


[12/3/2023 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
I'm going to go play Zelda with Z fora while, but it is a slightly hacky bit of logic that

(a) implements in the location chain the idea of a separate "filter", "first format string", "all format string"
(b) syntax is ```<current:filter;firstFormat;allFormat>```
(c) if ```<current:x>``` is specified, and x is a valid format string, it will be treated as firstFormat rather than filter
(d) the default format is 'q' but 'Q' overrides (i.e. if you have both q and Q you do not get link text)


[12/3/2023 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
here is what I am doing:
// a full formatfilter string is defined as filter;format;firstformat
// if the string is only two parts, it is filter+firstformat;format
// if the string is only one part, it is filter+firstformat


[12/3/2023 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
so Qp is interpreted as filter: p, firstformat: Q, format: null


[12/3/2023 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
Qp;q is interpreted as filter: p, firstformat: Q, format: q (which is equivalent to p;q;Q)


[12/3/2023 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus
which is reversed from yours because that way if you have "p;q" and decide you need a separate first format you can add ";Q", or if you just want to specify firstformat you can do: Q


[12/3/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
Sure


[12/3/2023 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus
my hope is that even if my general token parser class isn't useful, at least the parseToken function might be. it also returns mindepth and maxdepth, so your result is:
```
        let result = {
            token: null,
            filter: null,
            format: null,
            firstformat: null,
            mindepth: 1,
            maxdepth: null
        };
```


[12/3/2023 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
That seems helpful


[12/3/2023 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
It would probably be nice for the location stuff to take that instead of the various params


[12/3/2023 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[12/3/2023 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
ultimately the idea is you have a format string like "Arbitrary text where <event> happened to <person>, at <name>", you pass it to a parser that splits it and passes each chunk to another parser, that returns either the raw text or the formatted string for that token


[12/3/2023 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
so each <token> has a parsed token object, and then each token needs a method to get the information given metadata. those are already written, so it just about reorganizing how things are passed around


[12/3/2023 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
but ideally would allow e.g. reusing depth filters for affiliation chains if we want to do that


[12/3/2023 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. <primary:2>


[12/3/2023 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
btw, I was thinking about your "metadata" thoughts doc, I think there is a lot of good stuff there. I think it might be worth reconsidering exactly what a header should be. For example, I'm not sure that for most random npcs I actually care when they are born, but I do care how old they are if known, and if they are alive or dead.


[12/3/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
for example, here's a random minor NPC I made up:

# Avelina Smith
>[!info]+ Biographical Info
> A Highlander [[Humans|human]] (she/her)
> Born DR 1673 (47 years old)

An important smith and leader of the metalworking community of [[Cleenseau]]. She trained with dwarves in her youth.


[12/3/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
anyway, more later, we are going to get lunch


[12/3/2023 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
fiddling amongst other things. here is the basic structure i'm working with:

pass a string to getDisplayString, which then parses out token and format with parseToken

then pass parsed token object to getFormattedToken, which checks through a bunch of cases to find the right way to (a) set the value of token.token, and (b) format that value based on the token object format parameters


[12/3/2023 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
for example, dates all get the "date" formatter applied, which for now is just DateManager.normalizeDate(value).display, but could in the future support eg a cy/dr format string option, or a full date (Jan 1, 1749) vs short date (1749), or other format options


[12/3/2023 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
strings get "string" format, which is basically NameManager.getName(string), although there are probably some quirks to smooth out


[12/3/2023 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
eventually the hope is a generic "chain" format that can built location or affiliation or other thing chains, that just needs to know what to follow


[12/3/2023 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
but for now locchain is its own thing


[12/3/2023 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, it is all in tokenParser, you can take a look


[12/3/2023 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
I'm messing around with a standardized name object


[12/3/2023 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
it isn't quite what you were talking about, but..


[12/3/2023 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i just pushed a few more Token Parser updates


[12/3/2023 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
the basic logic is:
```
   // This class is responsible for parsing tokens and returning formatted strings
    // There are two main functions:
    // 1. parseDisplayString: takes a display string with words and tokens ("This is a <token>, print it."), 
    //      replaces each token with a formatted version, and returns a formatted string
    // 2. getFormattedToken: takes a token string (<token:format>) and returns a formatted string
    // Both functions take a string as the first argument, a file object as the second argument, and a targetDate as the third argument
```


[12/3/2023 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
so one thing that would be very useful is something like normalizeDate for normalizeName, that could return the info needed to build a formatted name (which mostly needs to manage linking)


[12/3/2023 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is probably better if the normalize name function doesn't do the formatting itself, it just builds the name


[12/3/2023 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it is quite right the way you are trying to stick all the formatting inside the parser


[12/3/2023 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
I would have a formatName function in the name manager that takes a name object and format specifier and returns a formatted string


[12/3/2023 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
one of the challenges, for names in particular, is that most of the input for a name has to be overrideable


[12/3/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
well, that's fine too, you just pass token.format to NameManager.formatName


[12/3/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
to generate a name, you need:
* the "target"
* a potential alias
* a potential link text override
* potential article override (not yet in use)


[12/3/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
plus you need the source page, to get the right link text


[12/3/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
so the "getNameObject" API takes:

* a string (target)
* a string (sourcePageType)
* override object that has { alias, linkText, article }


[12/3/2023 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think that is quite right


[12/3/2023 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
you only need a source page in chains, right?


[12/3/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
anytime you want link text


[12/3/2023 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
that is, anytime you are generating a name for a relationship between page A & page B


[12/3/2023 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
you don't always have a relationship


[12/3/2023 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
but that is always a chain


[12/3/2023 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
person in campaign info


[12/3/2023 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
affiliations


[12/3/2023 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
both examples of "relationship names" that are not part of a chain


[12/3/2023 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
campaign info and affiliations are complicated


[12/3/2023 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
I thought about using <linktext> as a separate piece of data, but it doesn't work as nicely as :q / :Q


[12/3/2023 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
because you want to control whether/when it shows up


[12/3/2023 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
so logically, "<person:format>" should actually be generated by getting the name of the target page, using the current page as the sourceType


[12/3/2023 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so that is what I would consider a chain


[12/3/2023 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
sure, it is a chain of lengt 1


[12/3/2023 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea is you call the internal #formatToken recursively


[12/3/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so a token <person> becomes:
<linktext><name> 
with source = current, target = "person"


[12/3/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
same for location chains, you walk up the chain and each piece just generates a new token to call #formatToken


[12/3/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
sure but I don't think linkText is/should be a separate token


[12/3/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
too hard to determine if/when it appears


[12/3/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
"<person:xxx>" should become <name:xxx> in the context of the person page


[12/3/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. you call getName passing the value of person and the source page as te current page


[12/3/2023 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/3/2023 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't quite figured out how you have link text coded


[12/3/2023 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
but that would be fine too


[12/3/2023 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the thing I'm not currently sure of is where the override information comes from


[12/3/2023 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
is it always calculable from a prior step in the recursion? or does the getFormattedToken need to take an override object itself


[12/3/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
curently string formatter takes it


[12/3/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
I believe that will stay true


[12/3/2023 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
but where does string formatter get it?


[12/3/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
its a parameter


[12/3/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
it comes from whoever is formatting the string


[12/3/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
in the current code, it comes from the location manager, when it decides to format a string to represent the current whereabout, it knows the overrides because they are coming from whereabouts.linkText


[12/3/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
or whereabouts.alias


[12/3/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
separately, string formatter in some cases knows it itself, i.e. when it is formatting "species" and sees a "specieAlias"


[12/3/2023 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but all that is already being passed via the file object, it is just a matter of where it is calculated


[12/3/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
or typeof and sees a typeOfAlias


[12/3/2023 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
the whereabout isn't, it is the next level down the chain


[12/3/2023 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
well more precisely it is calculatable from the metadata


[12/3/2023 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
well, everything is calculated from some piece of metadata somewhere


[12/3/2023 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
but you dont want the token / string code to know about whereabouts


[12/3/2023 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. it shouldn't access whereabout.linkText


[12/3/2023 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
well, it has to, because if your token is <current> you need to get wb.current


[12/3/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
but it shouldn't know what to do with a whereabout


[12/3/2023 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
no, all it knows to do is to pass it to locationChainFormatter or whatever


[12/3/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
it gets wb.current and then askes the location manager to do something with it


[12/3/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
the location manager then in turn decides it needs to format a string, so askes the string formatter to format <name:q>


[12/3/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
etc


[12/3/2023 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/3/2023 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
but the getDisplayString never needs to get any input data besides a string with tokens, a file to start at, and possibly a targetDate


[12/3/2023 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
display string parses out tokens, token formatter takes each token and calls the correct manager to handle it, and then returns the formatted string to getDisplayString


[12/3/2023 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway we are about to leave


[12/3/2023 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
more later


[12/3/2023 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
That's wrong, but yes, we are also leaving


[12/3/2023 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
Might fiddle a bit more - you should push what you’ve been doing even if it isn’t fully functional yet


[12/3/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
pushed


[12/3/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
it gets articles wrong at the moment


[12/3/2023 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
plus a couple of bugfixes


[12/4/2023 1:10 AM] rsulfuratus
couldn't sleep so I stayed up too late fiddling around. i think i finally understood your string parsing setup.

the Token Parser class should be (mostly) able to replace the StringManager class. you can call it either with a display string ("Display this <name:format>"), an unparsed token (<name:format>) , or a parsed token object. 

the key advantage IMO is it separates token parsing into (a) getting the format string, and (b) figuring out the correct manager to call to format the particular token. 

all the Token Parser functions take:
(a) input (either a display string, a token, or a token object, depending on the function)
(b) a file (equivalent to file in getFormattedString)
(c) a targetDate (the date you want the token formatted at)
(d) an overrides object

The overrides object is generally just appended to metadata, so it can be used to supply any format-line-specific metadata (like person/met for campaign info).  but there are some special terms used for NameManager and others, see the code


[12/4/2023 1:11 AM] rsulfuratus
there are still some bugs for sure and doesn't necessarily work well with everything else (e.g. locationManager) but at least for me separating format parsing and "what do I do with this token" feels a lot easier to understand


[12/4/2023 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
I think in general it makes sense but it drops a number of features from string formatter, i.e. the ability to do stuff only on the first item and have prefixes and suffixies


[12/4/2023 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly been super busy but just pushed a fix for prefixes and suffixes


[12/4/2023 2:49 PM] .deciusmus
ah, hrm. I spent a while at lunch rewriting the whole thing to work


[12/4/2023 2:49 PM] .deciusmus
then I got busy and didn't get a chance to push it


[12/4/2023 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
oops


[12/4/2023 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think I pretty much had stringmanager 100% replaced


[12/4/2023 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
the most useful bit was distinguishing between "name" tokens and "casing" tokens which solved my problem of strings coming up as "A born..."


[12/4/2023 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
parse-tokens has my fixes but yours may be cleaner


[12/4/2023 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
yah, I just wrote a giant regex with https://regexr.com/ that matches everything perfectly to groups

        //      fifth, the all item format string: the standard format string options. Must be separated from the filter with a semi colon

            token.chainFormat = match[5] ?? match[4] ?? ""
            token.suffix = match[6] ?? ""
        }


[12/4/2023 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
that formated weird:

```
    // this is a complicated regex, but basically it is 6 groups:
        //      first, prefix: contained in (), any letters or spaces
        //      second, token: letters only

            return null;
        }

        let match = regexp.exec(input)
        if (match) {
            token.prefix = match[1] ?? ""
            token.token = match[2] ?? ""
            token.filter = match[3] ?? ""
            token.format = match[4] ?? ""
            token.chainFormat = match[5] ?? match[4] ?? ""
            token.suffix = match[6] ?? ""
        }
````


[12/4/2023 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
it handles filters vs formats nicely


[12/4/2023 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
i.e


[12/4/2023 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
this works too: <(\(.*?\))?([a-zA-Z]+):?([^:()\s<>]+?)?(\(.*?\))?>


[12/4/2023 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
```
<(\(.*?\))?([a-zA-Z]+):?([^:()\s<>]+?)?(\(.*?\))?>
```


[12/4/2023 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but you have to separately parse the filter


[12/4/2023 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
```<token:filterformat>``` works

as does

```<token:filter;format>```

but you can't do

```<token:formatfilter>```


[12/4/2023 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
but I think that's fine


[12/4/2023 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
I also renamed "first format" to format and chainFormat to the remainder.


[12/4/2023 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
my version is:
`<token:a>`: a is interpreted as a "all format" + filter
`<token:a;b>`: a is interpreted as "all format"  + filter; b is first format


[12/4/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
so the "expanded" syntax is

```<token:filter;format;chainFormat>```

where chainFormat applies to *everything* in a chain; format applies to the first part only (which, if it isn't a chain, is the same as everything)


[12/4/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
yeah mine is basically the same but it inverts "all" vs "first" format


[12/4/2023 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
with the special case of, if you apply a format but no chain format it is both


[12/4/2023 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. <token:filter;q> applies to the whole chain


[12/4/2023 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
I guess it would be better to say:

```<token:filter;format>```

where the ```filter;``` is optional is the expected format, and if specified, applies to everything


[12/4/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
if you need to differentiate "first" from "rest", you need to say:

```<token:filter;rest;first>```


[12/4/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
(where again, the `filter;` is optional)


[12/4/2023 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is easier to have <token:string> parse string as either "filter + format" or "filter + chainFormat" (in your terms), and then have <token:string;string2> parse string2 as the other one


[12/4/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
isn't that way simpler?


[12/4/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
it is just a question of whether <token:qr> should apply q as "format" or "chainFormat" and I have no strong opinions about that


[12/4/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
well, the regex I wrote breaks apart the filter automaticlly


[12/4/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
you can't intermix


[12/4/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
i.e.

1-2qr is not valid


[12/4/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
because the 1-2r is a filter and the q is a format


[12/4/2023 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
well then my regex is better 😉


[12/4/2023 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
but I did that on purpose so I could do:

token.format = group
token.fiilter = group


[12/4/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
but that is not hard to parse, as long as format and filter chars are distinct


[12/4/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
you only ever need to parse it once, so why not just separately parse the filter?


[12/4/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
the formatfilter string


[12/4/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean


[12/4/2023 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
eh, I don't have strong feelings. but it seems very trivial benefit to be able to write 2qr vs having to write 2rq


[12/4/2023 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
the format and filter codes are hard enough to remember, having the order be critical just makes more fragile and harder to use


[12/4/2023 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
and it makes the groups easier, i.e. x;y naturally "knows" whether it is a filter and a format or two formats


[12/4/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
and filterformat;other also can automatially parse into the right group sets


[12/4/2023 3:04 PM] rsulfuratus
well I was going for ease of writing. if I have a party meeting line with <current:2q> and I decide I don't want the regions, I don't want to have to remember I have to insert r after 2, I just want to add r. numbers have to go first is enough to remember


[12/4/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
see, I think having 2q is bad practice. it should be 2;q


[12/4/2023 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
that's much easier for me to see and understand


[12/4/2023 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
2farlP buries the a


[12/4/2023 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
you want to encourage 2frlP;a


[12/4/2023 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, but should 2farlP just not work? I guess I prefer tolerance in this case


[12/4/2023 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not against it, just found it much simpler to not support it


[12/4/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
my code to parse the filter string should work, it just required some tweaking to properly support prefixes and suffixes


[12/4/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
it is easy to modify to support whatever a, a;b, and a;b;c should mean


[12/4/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i picked the option that seemed to generate the most correct text with current metadata display defaults


[12/4/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway I have to get Nathaniel to martial arts but I'm not doing anything from 4-5 roughly so if you push your changes I can at least attempt to rebase my token-parser branch


[12/4/2023 3:10 PM] .deciusmus
rebase will be hopeless, I deleted all that code


[12/4/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
but if you want to restore the token parsing, to your way I won't object although keep my regex as a comment at least


[12/4/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
the main things are
(a) don't split out the depths; that is a whereabouts specific thing and I don't think it should be assumed that it is a property of a token
(b) you need to return the prefix and suffix


[12/4/2023 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
why do we assume that depth is a whereabouts specific thing? the reason to split it out is that any chain could theoretically have a depth filter, e.g. at some point we might want to allow a depth filter for affiliation chains or anything else


[12/4/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
but filters might not always be for chains


[12/4/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
and I don't think it adds value


[12/4/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
with the current setup it is *much* simpler for the thing that takes a filter to handle the filter; it is really an opaque blob


[12/4/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
arguably the syntax should be something like

<token:[filter]format>


[12/4/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
where filter is literally an opaque blob


[12/4/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
then you could do stuff like

<affiliations:[type=primary]>


[12/4/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
for now that seems too complex


[12/4/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
but having the token parser try to "understand" the filter doesn't seem worthwhile


[12/4/2023 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
Fair enough. The concept of what a filter is supposed to be is pretty ambiguous arm


[12/4/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
But opaque blob is fine


[12/4/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I am currently trying to re-understand token parser. I will open a pull request tonight to merge this into main, and you are welcome to comment at that point, but i'm probably not going to try to merge any new changes from new-whereabouts at this point. 

While I appreciate that some of your ideas here are better than mine, the whole thing I enjoy about this is figuring out how to implement things and get them to work. I realize that I am not the fastest coder but I think it is okay if this isn't done in 24 hours. 

If you really feel like this is too much your project to let anyone else fiddle around with I'll find another coding project, but I'm enjoying this and it is useful to learn from your experience. It just isn't fun for you to just reimplement all my code while I'm still trying to get it to work in the first place


[12/4/2023 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a reason i've been doing this all on an isolated branch


[12/4/2023 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
I totally get that... I'm actually kinda ready to be done mucking about with Javascript as much as I have been... but I want to be able to quickly add new stuff when I want it here. It's tough to know how to balance that. Do I just add stuff to the old way?


[12/4/2023 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
I don't really intend/want to trample on your coding exercise at all, I'm just not sure how to move this all forward if we end up with two parallel development tracks


[12/4/2023 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm suggesting maybe it doesn't have to move forward super-quickly?


[12/4/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean I get you want to mess around too, but I'd suggest either just spending less time on it or messing around with different parts instead of the same thing at once


[12/4/2023 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. there is plenty to do with event handling, for example


[12/4/2023 6:09 PM] rsulfuratus
in general of course having well-defined APIs would help let us both mess around with interacting parts of the code at the same time


[12/4/2023 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
but also i'm happy to port stuff from the old way to the new way, as long as things don't change SO fast that I can never catch up without spending 8 hours a day on it


[12/4/2023 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
for example with the token parser, most of what i was doing was almost totally independent of your name object stuff


[12/4/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I mean, the token parser was a pretty close-to-drop-in replacement for string formatter


[12/4/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
it just made solving certain problems a lot easier


[12/4/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
so I didn't want to wait for it to be ready 🙂


[12/4/2023 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway kate is cooking dinner tonight so i'm working on it now and will hopefully push something cleaned up soon, although there are still probably some bugfixes


[12/4/2023 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't help when I keep running into weird things like javascript considers an empty array to be truthy (in python you wouldn't need complicated things like `if (value && (!Array.isArray(value) || value.length > 0)) `)


[12/4/2023 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
your whereabout stuff is clever


[12/4/2023 6:31 PM] .deciusmus
same pattern works for affiliations


[12/4/2023 6:31 PM] .deciusmus
way nicer


[12/4/2023 6:31 PM] .deciusmus
Haven't figured out how to make it work for multi-line strings, but I will leave that for your project 🙂


[12/4/2023 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
what is your opinion on the following:
I currently have the #getFormattedName to either take a name object, or value is not a name object, look for a property in metadata called "<token>Alias" and if that exists, build a name object with the value of that as the alias


[12/4/2023 6:34 PM] .deciusmus
dinner is ready so afk for a while. That special casing works but you need to be careful about generic values vs names


[12/4/2023 6:35 PM] .deciusmus
that is, take a look at the difference between "casing" and "name"


[12/4/2023 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
this is not for generic metadata, just for things processed by "name" formatting


[12/4/2023 6:35 PM] .deciusmus
yeah it is probably a good general rule


[12/4/2023 6:35 PM] .deciusmus
actually could solve a bunch of issues with ancestry


[12/4/2023 6:35 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. 

ancestry: Sembara
ancestryAlias: western Sembaran


[12/4/2023 6:35 PM] .deciusmus
or whatevr


[12/4/2023 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah just means that that is a general rule


[12/4/2023 6:36 PM] .deciusmus
reduces the special case for species and typeOf


[12/4/2023 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
if a token is processed by the name formatter, then "tokenAlias" becomes alias


[12/4/2023 6:36 PM] .deciusmus
yeah makes sense (with the exception of name itself)


[12/4/2023 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
but default is still casing


[12/4/2023 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
if value is a name object then it just gets passed to name manager


[12/4/2023 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
left a few comments on your pr;


[12/4/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a fix for the infinite loop


[12/4/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
that was in my whereabouts chain code


[12/4/2023 8:25 PM] rsulfuratus
great


[12/4/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
there are a couple of other bugs, do you want me to fix them?


[12/4/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
aliases don't work correctly and the "is first" logic is wrong


[12/4/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm trying to fix the isFirst logic which I can't quite track down


[12/4/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
please fix aliases


[12/4/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
any objection to moving the alias check to the main switch statement, so that getFormattedName always has a name object


[12/4/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I didn't put it there, because then you have to repeat it for typeof and species as well


[12/4/2023 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. something like this:

```
            case "ancestry":
            case "subtypeof":
            case "subspecies":
            case "species":
            case "person":
                let valueFromMetadata = this.#getParameterCaseInsensitive(metadata, token.token)
                let possibleAliasKey = token.token + "alias"
                let alias = this.#getParameterCaseInsensitive(metadata, possibleAliasKey)
```


[12/4/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
ah yeah that is good


[12/4/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
I am also tempted to resplit typeof and maintype


[12/4/2023 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
although maybe there is no sense in which you'd ever have a page with species and typeOf?


[12/4/2023 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
Probably okay to split it


[12/4/2023 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
right now it is impossible to get the typeof a page that has a specieis


[12/4/2023 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I merged them originally because it didn't occur to me you could have just a bunch of cascading cases into the same processing but with that setup the benefit of merging is less clear actually

Re: "This will break files that have an actual name attribute in metadata that doesn’t match the filename. (Ie some of the Cleenseau people who non-ascii names). We should only use the name instead of the filename is the name is a normalized name object)"


[12/4/2023 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
The reason I did it this way is that I want "Béatrix of Cleenseau" to use metadata.name (which is "Béatrix of Cleenseau") instead of file.name (which is Beatrix of Cleenseau) for the main H1 of the note. But, I think that if you pass Beatrix of Cleenseau to the name formatter it should return Béatrix of Cleenseau anyway, yes?


[12/4/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
getNameObject expects to get either
(a) a filename
(b) an unlinkable string


[12/4/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
basically the way getNameObject works is that first, it tries to find the file for the target


[12/4/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
and then it calculates the articles and stuff from the file


[12/4/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
if it can't find the file, it makes some stuff up best it can


[12/4/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
you can see the bug if you go to Beatrix and delete the aliases


[12/4/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
her name will become The Béatrix of Cleenseau


[12/4/2023 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so there is no reason to pass metadata.name because you are going to end up with that anyway (via the file Beatrix of Cleenseau)


[12/4/2023 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/4/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
HOWEVER, various things that want to override name set (currently) overrides.name


[12/4/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I was catching that in the formatter function but it seems like your way is better to just format it here


[12/4/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, I'm afk for a bit


[12/4/2023 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
feel free to fix any of the name/alias bugs


[12/4/2023 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
and deconvolute any merged tokens


[12/4/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i am still tracking down a few small bugs and then will deal with the formatfilter string parsing, which I think you are right, you can either pass a single string that is filter+format (but no chain format), or a separated string that is either filter;format;chain
filter;format
format;chain


[12/4/2023 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
that is relatively straightforward to fix just requires a bit of fiddling


[12/4/2023 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
ok, I pushed a fix to the name stuff


[12/4/2023 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
not going to do much more tonight

{Reactions}
👍

[12/5/2023 7:55 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed a bunch of bugfixes last night. have another busy day today so might not do much, but I don't feel any particular ownership over any remaining bugs so fix whatever you want if you feel like it.


[12/5/2023 7:55 AM] rsulfuratus
I also moved the get party meeting stuff to a new EventManager class, in preparation for thinking about event-style metadata a bit more, but probably won't do much on that front for a while


[12/5/2023 7:56 AM] rsulfuratus
probably still a few lingering bugs as I test more pages, will add more possibly buggy pages to the PR comments as I find them


[12/5/2023 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed fixes for those bugs


[12/5/2023 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
A few other things:

1. We should tweak some of the default text to better take advantage of these features, but I would wait for that to merge
2. There is still an issue with link text in chains. If you make the place - place link text = "", then you get

[12/5/2023 11:23 AM] .deciusmus
Also messing around a bit the "r" filter is fiddly


[12/5/2023 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
it would probably be nicer if "r" meant "don't show regions except the first one"


[12/5/2023 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
For example, Wave Dancer in 1720 shows

Last known location: (empty)

Because the default filter is r, and the last known location is Eastern Green Sea.

It can be fixed with

[12/5/2023 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
but it seems annoying to have to set the startFilter on every region location


[12/5/2023 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
and sometimes it gets fiddly, i.e. on Akan, you don't want to see the whole chain (plains north east of Kawara, Eastern Dunmar, Dunmar, Central Lowlands...)


[12/5/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
another option would be to have f mean "always show first"


[12/5/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
sorry, F


[12/5/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
f = only first
F = always first


[12/5/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. so Fr shows the first even if it is a region


[12/5/2023 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
with regions specifically, another option would be to just be a little more judicious about "region" as opposed to "subregion" or something else


[12/5/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
true


[12/5/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
although that doesn't help the "Eastern Green Sea" wave dancer example


[12/5/2023 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus
F as skip first is a little pointless with the slice now, though, so it might be useful to repurpose


[12/5/2023 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, that is what I was thinking


[12/5/2023 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
I just got out of a meeting and have 20 minutes, I'm going to check a few more pages but I think we could probably merge at this point if there are no more obvious bugs


[12/5/2023 11:37 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, I just did the same


[12/5/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
I have a few page fixes to push but no code fixes


[12/5/2023 11:40 AM] .deciusmus
Is there a reason Apolloyon had:

```
 whereabouts:
 - {type: home, end: 1059, location: Drankor}
-- {type: away, start: 1053}
 - {type: away, start: 1060}
```


[12/5/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
I wanted the created location for the Scepter of Command to be unknown


[12/5/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
it causes the Scepter of Command to lose the "in Drankor"


[12/5/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
ha, ok


[12/5/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
that was the main reason Scepter of COmmand was on the test case pag


[12/5/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
so I was checking for tha


[12/5/2023 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah the test case files need a bit of cleanup some of them are probably not needed


[12/5/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
Cloak of Rainbows covers the case


[12/5/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
(i.e. an item created by someone who's past location was known but current isn't)


[12/5/2023 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
oh, that reminds me. The Chalice of the Runepriest is in the test case to remind that we should ideally find a solution to the blank case demonstrated by the chalice where having no pageDated of affiliations output causes this weird gap between (unique chalice) and the whereabouts


[12/5/2023 11:46 AM] .deciusmus
I was planning on getting rid of the individual "get_xxxx" and instead just having a single "output header box contents"


[12/5/2023 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
at some point


[12/5/2023 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would be better


[12/5/2023 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but doesn't need to happen for this pr


[12/5/2023 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
no, definitely not


[12/5/2023 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
oh one other thing - the various merges means we have getPartyMeeting in both whereabouts and the new EventManager class


[12/5/2023 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a bunch of fixes to individual pages, mostly setting displayDefaults like linkText that were wrong (i.e. Dunmar Fellowship should be "by" not "with")


[12/5/2023 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
once this PR merges I'm going to delete all the unused code

{Reactions}
👍

[12/5/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Also your casing change is not quite right


[12/5/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
its fine to merge but it isn't going to do the right thing if you want say "initial upper"


[12/5/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
it will generate:

The prefix of Place


[12/5/2023 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
rather than
The prefix of place


[12/5/2023 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
For title case it works fine, because title case is the same regardless


[12/5/2023 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
what does the current code generate for that case?


[12/5/2023 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
the prefix is uncased


[12/5/2023 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
I think: "the prefix of Place"?


[12/5/2023 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/5/2023 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
well, depends


[12/5/2023 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
that was the case I was trying to fix, "part of The Great War" annoyed me


[12/5/2023 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
I mean the easy fix is change the prefix to Part of


[12/5/2023 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
but ideally it should be "Part of the Great War" not "Part of The Great War"


[12/5/2023 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
but then you get "A battle, Part of the Great War"


[12/5/2023 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
(if you have <subtypeof(,)> <(part of)partof:u>)


[12/5/2023 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
the right fix is to have the prefix and suffix passed into name manager


[12/5/2023 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
the prefix is basically link text


[12/5/2023 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
but not everything with a prefix is a name


[12/5/2023 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
but yeah that is probably generally better


[12/5/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
but everything that should support casing format strings should either go through the casing formatter or the name formatter


[12/5/2023 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that's true


[12/5/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. the simplest fix would be to just change :

```    #getFormattedCaseString(value, token) {
        // this is something that can never be meaningfully linked
        // and never has an article
        // but which might need casing rules

        const { NameManager } = customJS;

        // this probably just returns itself, but...
        let name = { name: value, linkText: "", indefiniteArticle: "", definiteArticle: "", linkTarget: undefined }

        return NameManager.formatName(name, token.format)
    }
```


[12/5/2023 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
so set linkText to token.prefix


[12/5/2023 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
(suffix doesn't work, but usually suffixes don't have casing rules)


[12/5/2023 11:56 AM] .deciusmus
it would be pretty easy to change name manager to take a suffix as well


[12/5/2023 11:56 AM] .deciusmus
but actually ignore that


[12/5/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
you'd have to set linktext to prefix and add "q" to the format string


[12/5/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
its probably better for name manager to have an explicit prefix and suffix


[12/5/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm going to leave it for now


[12/5/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
anyway the fix you have for right now is fine


[12/5/2023 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
it isn't like subtle casing bugs are a big deal


[12/5/2023 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
having the initial lowercase annoys me a lot more than a extra capitalized The before a placename


[12/5/2023 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
I am merging the PR now, then will be busy most of the rest of the afternoon


[12/5/2023 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
we have a lot of stale branches, unless you object I'm going to delete everything except new-whereabouts, which might still have some unmerged bugfixes; can also leave feature/families-and-kingdoms if it has anything you want


[12/5/2023 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
you can delete familes and kingdoms


[12/5/2023 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
I have a meeting @ 1, but depending on whether I feel like doing code reviews for work or not, might work on this a bit


[12/5/2023 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to implement the F rule and change defaults


[12/5/2023 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
sounds great


[12/5/2023 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
to include F


[12/5/2023 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
we are building a new website for my lab and currently discussing an auto-generated "About" page with little image boxes for each person with autogenerated summary text based on a yaml or json object.....probably not going to suggest we just use my existing javascript token parser but....


[12/5/2023 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, maybe I can steal the code one of my staff is writing to auto-generate html snippets to make like "People of X" pages with clickable images for taelgarverse


[12/5/2023 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
I'd love the ability to have

[12/5/2023 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure if this actually works but claims to support dataview


[12/5/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
I looked at it


[12/5/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
It runs within obisidian


[12/5/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
it works by using the obsidian "renderashtml" api to render each page as html, so the output looks exactly like your vault looks


[12/5/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
we are using material for mkdocs for my group website and it has a lot of flexibility that our current setup doesn't have, and makes a much nicer website. so I think my preference is not to rely on the obsidian html renderer which gives up a ton of control


[12/5/2023 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I agree


[12/5/2023 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but i'm not interested in writing the code to convert obsidian markdown to mkdocs markdown


[12/5/2023 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
so hoping to find something that can do that and replace obsidianhtml


[12/5/2023 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
anything dynamic we want rendered on the website would rely on using an export-style dataview command to push static content to the export version of the vault


[12/5/2023 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
which I think is probably fine


[12/5/2023 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
yes. It is quite easy to do that, via dv.markdownTable


[12/5/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
it is a bit of a pain if you want arbitrary dataview


[12/5/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
but in general, I think 95% of the use cases is going to be very specific types of queries that are build in javascript anyway


[12/5/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. an events table


[12/5/2023 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/5/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
why not just use the md -> md parts of obsidian html?


[12/5/2023 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
or does it convert straight to html?


[12/5/2023 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
it does run some markdown cleaning to convert things like wikilinks but the code is a bit squirelly and is a bit of a kludge


[12/5/2023 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
plus no longer maintained


[12/5/2023 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd prefer something I understand enough that I can fork it and keep it running if needed


[12/5/2023 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
it also converts the wrong things - it is actually fairly easy to support wikilinks in mkdocs, for example, so converting links is not needed. but stripping code blocks is nice, which obsdianhtml doesn't do


[12/5/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
can't mkdocs strip codeblocks?


[12/5/2023 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah it should be able to


[12/5/2023 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
it actually may not require any conversion to use obsidian straight with mkdocs with the right plugins


[12/5/2023 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
When I researched this a while ago, a lot of people were using the tools of their prefered markdown -> html toolchain, rather than something for obsidian specifically


[12/5/2023 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/5/2023 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
I was looking at someone's workflow that used jekyll


[12/5/2023 3:40 PM] .deciusmus
and they got leaflet and mermaid codeblocks to work by just having jekyll plugins that converted the obsidian codeblocks to jekyll codeblocks


[12/5/2023 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
Here's a separate question.... part of chains...

I think we should redefine part of to mean:

* a chain of like-typed things that this thing is part of

so organizations can be part of other organizations 
items can be part of other items
but organizations cant be part of places


[12/5/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
events can be part of other events


[12/5/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
etc


[12/5/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
Once we have fully removed partOf: to mean whereabout: in places, it might be interesting to see if it would be useful to allow a place to be "part of" a place and use that to define politcal relationships


[12/5/2023 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
but at the moment I was thinking about cleaning up how part of chains are parsed as it is the last "hacky" thing


[12/5/2023 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i think that makes sense


[12/5/2023 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
to use partOf as political affiliations we'd need to allow them to be dated, I think


[12/5/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually think the concept of places might benefit from being informally separated into:
- structures / settlements / etc
- geographic locations
- political units


[12/5/2023 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
they are all places, and I don't think it is worth defining them strictly


[12/5/2023 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but for example it might be nice to have Guildhome (ward) be partOf Tollen


[12/5/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
it would allow something like a general page on Tollender culture separate from the city of Tollen, and then both Tollen and Western Cymea could be partOf the "Tollender" page


[12/5/2023 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
but a person in a city in western Cymea wouldn't show up as "Currently in the Palanca Hills, Western Cymea, Tollen" which doesn't make sense


[12/5/2023 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it would also be useful to implement a "with" whereabout type and also expect that "home" and "away" can only be locations. you can be "with" a person or an organization or an item


[12/5/2023 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
if I start working on anything soon, it will probably be events and dates. with the token parser it would be really easy to just normalize all dates as "days since time began" internally and then we can have a dr vs cy formatter token


[12/5/2023 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
i'd also like to convert all elven born dates to just ka, and then parse a table to get CY year each ka started to calculate ages


[12/5/2023 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
it would be a little complicated to figure out the input, but it might just be worth having any date be able to be in an object representation as well, and the default conversion be dr. but if you want an elf with 
`born: { date: 26, unit: ka }`
you can


[12/5/2023 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but `born: 1712` still works find because it defaults to DR


[12/5/2023 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
my main hesitation is that it messes up dataview queries and forces dataviewjs because any date-based metadata needs to be run through normalizeDate


[12/5/2023 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
I am cleaning up dates now in prep for that


[12/5/2023 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
true. I think the basic goal at the moment is to get clean partOf for orgs and items (if you wanted phase stone: partof vindistrjarna, i.e.) and events. Then do some data quality cleanup to get rid of old partOf for places and move them to whereabouts, then see what might be useful

{Reactions}
👍

[12/5/2023 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
it is much easier to work with dates in taelgar than the real world


[12/5/2023 7:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I mostly have to do work tonight, but I might start messing around with date conversions. i don't necessarily want to figure out what the final normalized date structure should be or anything like that. my initial goal would be to write a set of functions that take an integer (in days since time began) and return a formatted string in ka/dwarven/DR and possibly other formats


[12/5/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i might also mess around with the reverse, taking the string representation of a DR or CY date (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD), or a integer ka, and converting to days since time began


[12/5/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i am going to start a feature/date-conversion branch


[12/5/2023 7:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but not sure if i'll do much of this tonight as I do have a few hours of real work to do


[12/5/2023 7:25 PM] .deciusmus
I did about half of this already

👍

[12/5/2023 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm actually more interested in formalizing / canonizing the calendar systems themselves than the coding. actually not totally straightforward since years don't line up


[12/5/2023 7:30 PM] rsulfuratus
did you push that anywhere?


[12/5/2023 7:32 PM] .deciusmus
no, i went to eat dinner


[12/5/2023 7:34 PM] .deciusmus
just pushed to  feature/date-refactor


[12/5/2023 7:44 PM] .deciusmus
This is the part I did. My actual goal is to be able to show ages as something less than a year if needed


[12/5/2023 7:47 PM] .deciusmus
So i was starting with the idea that a date in a taelgar is just a number of days since creation


[12/5/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
added a CY export


[12/5/2023 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
still double-checking calculations


[12/5/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
I just pushed a fix to the "figure out the month" logic


[12/5/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
last days of month didn't work


[12/5/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. the last day of nov is 11/30 not 12/0


[12/5/2023 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
but also it doesn't seem to be calculating correctly on actual pages but haven't looked into why


[12/5/2023 8:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm just checking conversion math with jsfiddle.net


[12/5/2023 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
you still have a day 0 issue, 365 days after creation is 1/0/2 not 12/31/1


[12/5/2023 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
if you want to test in obsidian, btw, this is the easiest way:

```dataviewjs
const {DateManager} = customJS

dv.paragraph(DateManager.normalizeDate(dv.current().born))
```


[12/5/2023 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
on some random page


[12/5/2023 8:53 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the issue is only with how years turn over


[12/5/2023 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
364 days after creation is 12/30/1


[12/5/2023 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
365 is 1/0/2


[12/5/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
right, its this

        let year = Math.floor(convertedDays / 365) + 1


[12/5/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
but DR<->CY conversion seems to work


[12/5/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
because 365/365 generates 1 not 0


[12/5/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
I need use math.ceiling


[12/5/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
and not add the one


[12/5/2023 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. 3/17/1748 DR is 1/1/5881 CY which is correct


[12/5/2023 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that fixes it


[12/5/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a fix


[12/5/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
also fixed a stupid case missing a break, so now it sems to be working


[12/5/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
except now that I got rid of all jsDates, ages are calculated in days


[12/5/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
but that's what I wanted an age formatter in token parser


[12/5/2023 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right. i'd default to years if days > 365*2, months otherwise


[12/5/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm actually if the age difference is exactly 365 days that probably means DR_start == DR_end


[12/5/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
I'd save that for approximate dates


[12/5/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
and the moment I was going to do exactly what you say


[12/5/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah makes sense


[12/5/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
but where months = 30 day units


[12/5/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I think dwarves should have 10 months of 35 days each (divided into 5 weeks of 7 days each)


[12/5/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
then, three 5-day intercalary "months"


[12/5/2023 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
or maybe 5 3-day


[12/5/2023 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
actually five 3-day intercalary periods is better. between every other month you have a 3-day transition


[12/5/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
sounds reasonable


[12/5/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
the age calculation is annoying. If you have bare years, it is one day off


[12/5/2023 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
so the whole thing is super regular. The first day of the year is also always the same day of the week because you have exactly 35 weeks in a year


[12/5/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
you should probably only ever pass it normalized strings, no? 1748-01-01 is correct


[12/5/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
as far as I can tell anyway


[12/5/2023 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
just set day = 1 if not day


[12/5/2023 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
in getDaysSinceCreation


[12/5/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
if you just give it a year you are missing one from `days += ((year - 1) * 365) + day`


[12/5/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
no, I think the issue in the age calculation


[12/5/2023 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
rather, there were 2 bugs


[12/5/2023 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
1) I wasn't respecting the isEnd logic for bare dates, i.e. born: 1714


[12/5/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
that I just pushed a fix for


[12/5/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I like dwarven year being super regular


[12/5/2023 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
but no real opinions on the actual structure


[12/5/2023 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
The issue with age is that:
(a) bare years for born get 1-1-year and for died get 12-31-year
(b) someone born on Jan 1st 1000 who died on Dec 31st 1002 was in fact only 1 year and 364 days old
(c) but it seems a bit annoying to show their age as 23 months rather than 2 years


[12/5/2023 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
just round up instead of down for months and convert to years once you hit 24 months


[12/5/2023 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
days/(365/12) = months


[12/5/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
or like Math.ceil(days/(365/12))


[12/5/2023 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
then if >24, Math.round(months/12)


[12/5/2023 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
>= 24


[12/5/2023 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, but then you get the wrong value if you have exact dates


[12/5/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but do you really care if you display 23 months as 2 years?


[12/5/2023 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
no, nevermnd


[12/5/2023 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
it all works fine


[12/5/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
the actual issue is that I needed to divide by 30.4 not 30


[12/5/2023 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. 
return Math.floor(value/30.4) + " months"


[12/5/2023 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
any opinion on what it should show if the age is actually exactly 0?


[12/5/2023 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
if you are dividing by a float anyway why not just 365/12?


[12/5/2023 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that's what you suggested actually and works fine


[12/5/2023 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
if age is exactly 0 I would not display it


[12/5/2023 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
that implies something that has a start date specified to the day and either no end or end on the same day


[12/5/2023 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, it looks a bit weird


[12/5/2023 9:39 PM] .deciusmus

[12/5/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
probably not worth worrying about honestly, there probably isn't anything that actually has an age of 0


[12/5/2023 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe round it up to "1 day"


[12/5/2023 9:42 PM] .deciusmus
the main case would be if we ever did something like show how long someone was at a stop


[12/5/2023 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
right, in that case you want to round up to 1 day


[12/5/2023 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
so that is probably a good default and anything else can wait for approx date formatting


[12/5/2023 9:42 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/5/2023 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
any opinions on whether there should be format strings for dates?


[12/5/2023 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, for ages


[12/5/2023 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
haven't gotten to dates


[12/5/2023 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
for exact ages, no


[12/5/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
or, at least not right now until we think of a need


[12/5/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
ok, all that is pushed


[12/5/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
for dates, I definitely would like a "force year only"


[12/5/2023 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
it seems to work pretty well


[12/5/2023 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
should be pretty easy to have a CY/DR for dates too, although it will get complicated the more display options we have


[12/5/2023 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
btw any objections to me mergint those 2 prs


[12/5/2023 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that's fine


[12/5/2023 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
although did you push any changes to the name formatter on #27?


[12/5/2023 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
it looks like you just parse `k` but don't do anything with it


[12/5/2023 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
or is that the point I guess


[12/5/2023 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
correct


[12/5/2023 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
that is the point


[12/5/2023 9:50 PM] .deciusmus
I was just finding it hard to read:

```<partof:;t>```

to get title case for the first item but not the rest


[12/5/2023 9:50 PM] .deciusmus
```<partof:k;t>``` is a lot nicer


[12/5/2023 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/5/2023 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I was thinking in context of names you usually have <name:q;t> or something


[12/5/2023 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but partof doesn't have any natural format you would usually apply


[12/5/2023 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
right, that is where it came up


[12/5/2023 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
or <name:q;Q> for origin


[12/5/2023 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
although with this change you could also just do <name:q;> for origin since blank (but not null) firstFormat is retained


[12/5/2023 9:52 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[12/5/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
D K C and Y are all free. I'd suggest date formats are:

Y = year only
D = DR
C = CY
K = (future) ka


[12/5/2023 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
default is D


[12/5/2023 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
I was actually thinking it might be worth something like {DR}, {CY}, {KA}, etc


[12/5/2023 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
just because I'd like to output Dunmari events in dynastic years, for example


[12/5/2023 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/5/2023 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
that makes sense


[12/5/2023 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
shouldn't be too bad to parse something like that


[12/5/2023 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
the suggestion is that {any letters} = valid format string but not filter?


[12/5/2023 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/5/2023 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
you'd want to split it out of the filterformat string before splitting on `;` I think


[12/5/2023 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but that is relatively easy regex parsing


[12/5/2023 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think there is every a case where it makes sense for date formats to separately apply to parts of a chain


[12/5/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
sure, and anyway, we don't have date chains


[12/5/2023 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
to simplify the filter checkers in other functions I'd pull date formats specifically into token.dateFormat and remove them


[12/5/2023 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so they aren't part of format strings and name formatter doesn't have to worry about letters in {}


[12/5/2023 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
*format checkers


[12/5/2023 10:03 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps you could just directly pass token.dateFormat to the date display function


[12/5/2023 10:04 PM] .deciusmus
one way to think of this is that we currently have 4 data formats:

* lists (whereabouts, part of, affliations)
* names + other name like strings
* age
* dates

(plus untyped/unformatable raw strings)


[12/5/2023 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
FWIW one could image date chains in events, e.g. died during the battle of urlich pass during the Great War


[12/5/2023 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
although perhaps that is more of a partOf chain than a date chain


[12/5/2023 10:04 PM] .deciusmus
that is a part of chain


[12/5/2023 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
you could do that almost trivially right now by just changing the partOf to be a type like { parent: xxx, format: yyy } and then passing the entire metadata of the file as part of the returned partOf object


[12/5/2023 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
in fact it would already work


[12/5/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
because the token parser does this

    results.push(this.formatDisplayString(item.format ?? "<name:" + formatStr + ">", {}, targetDate, item))


[12/5/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
for all list-types


[12/5/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
so if the partOf code returned an the full metadata + a format object, you could set the format of a line to include a date


[12/5/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
but of course, I'm not sure if that makes sense, as you probably would want to decide the format string from the source


[12/5/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
anyway, not going to fiddle now


[12/5/2023 10:08 PM] .deciusmus
What I was going to suggest is that there is an argument that the token format should be parsed by the type that is using it


[12/5/2023 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
could be something to think about. it does get a lot harder to remember though


[12/5/2023 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
we could get more tokens if we required a;b;c to be a = format, b=firstformat c=filter or something


[12/5/2023 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
or a|b;c where |b is optional


[12/5/2023 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
eventually we'll run out of separators but the filter/format string only techincally has to avoid ():<> and space


[12/5/2023 10:12 PM] .deciusmus
any reason not to merge the date stuff?


[12/5/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
are you working on dwarven calendar?


[12/5/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
the refactor to days seems pretty stable


[12/5/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
no I'm working on tracking down where all the people who have left my group in the past 5 years ended up for an "alumni" page


[12/5/2023 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
go ahead and merge


[12/5/2023 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
can change dwarven calendar export later, just need to have a different month function


[12/5/2023 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
I'm about to go to bed, I was just cleaning up my name manager suffix/prefix stuff


[12/5/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm going to add a (somewhat messy for now) dwarven calendar export


[12/5/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
it is much easier than DR since the number of days in the month doesn't matter


[12/5/2023 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
it won't be formatted because it doesn't have the fantasy calendar formatter


[12/5/2023 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
One question...
What do you expect this to generate : ```<(part of )partof:t>```

Given a part of chain like: 
The Battle of Something -> The War of Something -> The Epic Clash Against Something


[12/5/2023 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
Should it genreate:

Part of the Battle of Someting, The War of Something, The Epic Clash Against Something

or should it generate

Part of The Battle of Something, The War of Something, The Epic Clash Against Something


[12/5/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
that is, is the prefix considered "part of" the first element, and thus the "the" in the first element doesn't get upper case (the same way The Book of the Shadows) doesn't have the 2nd the uppered


[12/5/2023 10:40 PM] .deciusmus
or is the prefix its own element for title case purposes


[12/5/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
the second looks more natural to me


[12/5/2023 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't "Part of the Battle", it is Part of "The Battle"


[12/5/2023 10:41 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So in general, the prefix should be considered its own "part" as far as title casing goes


[12/5/2023 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/5/2023 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm. Should the prefix ever be title cased?


[12/5/2023 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe the prefix should only participate in initial upper rules


[12/5/2023 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus
probably the only formatter you really want to apply to prefix is the conditional upper case (when first)


[12/5/2023 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus
jinx


[12/5/2023 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus
actually might not be worth handling it with the name formatter


[12/5/2023 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
although you probably already have


[12/5/2023 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
basically it is just a "if initial upper, take it out of the token format and give it to the prefix"


[12/5/2023 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
otherwise prefix is not formatted


[12/5/2023 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
or actually I guess if you have an all lower case give it to prefix as well


[12/5/2023 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
you could just do like:
`token.prefix = token.format.replace(U, "") ? #format(token.prefix) : token.prefix`


[12/5/2023 10:50 PM] .deciusmus
I moved it to name manager and I'll push a PR in a minute but I'm not actually sure it was a good idea


[12/5/2023 10:50 PM] .deciusmus
because we might want prefixes and suffixes on other things, i.e. age or dates


[12/5/2023 10:50 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably better to simply manipulate the format string, as you suggest


[12/5/2023 11:07 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm. Well it’s my bed time but I think all the approaches are wrong. I’m not sure I want to spend a lot of time on casing though


[12/5/2023 11:08 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I wouldn't


[12/5/2023 11:09 PM] .deciusmus
The right answer though is probably to delete title casing entirely. It isn’t useful because all of the pages are the correct interior casing anyway


[12/5/2023 11:09 PM] .deciusmus
It’s really just whether you want to have lower case, keep case, or initial upper case


[12/5/2023 11:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I added a displayCY property to normalized date, which is the string "CY YYYY-MM-DD"


[12/5/2023 11:29 PM] .deciusmus
Really we should add format functions to the date object and remove display entirely


[12/5/2023 11:30 PM] .deciusmus
But that’s a nice start


[12/5/2023 11:30 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/5/2023 11:30 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure how to display the intercalary days, still working on that


[12/6/2023 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
working seriously on calendar eras here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anb-F8574X5BJbA4o1oeSRIuNveaXB--u21Owbd9LTA/edit?usp=sharing


[12/6/2023 9:48 AM] rsulfuratus
just have bits of 10-15 minute chunks throughout the day so will be pretty fragmentary for a while


[12/6/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
For dwarven calendar what about no months?

Each 73 day cycle has 7 named days (one for each thuhr) and 6 11 day weeks spaced Roman style like

Ruler day - 11 days - Traveller day - 11 days - etc 

Where the 1st and last day are both named


[12/6/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
Dates are cycle + counting towards next names day (like Roman kalends/nones/ides)


[12/6/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
Conventionally the middle day of each week is rest/market day


[12/6/2023 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
(And maybe you name the days like:
X
1 day after X
2 day after X
3 day after X
4 day after X
5 day after X
Between X and Y
5 day until Y
…
Y


[12/6/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
That is interesting


[12/6/2023 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I was kind of going for a slightly Mayan system with cycles-within-cycles-within-cycles


[12/6/2023 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. But the math of cycles in cycles in cycles is rough, as 73 is prime


[12/6/2023 12:27 PM] .deciusmus
So either you have a year is 5 cycles of 73, and the cycles inside 73 are messy, or you have to use something other than 365 for your big cycles


[12/6/2023 12:29 PM] .deciusmus
I think if you want cycles-in-cycles-in-cycles I'd have the intercalendary days outside of the nested cycle


[12/6/2023 12:30 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. have something like

big cycle is 360 days with 10 blocks of 36 each with 6 blocks of 6 or whatever


[12/6/2023 12:30 PM] .deciusmus
but obviously that is a lot harder to code as the inner cycles move around through the year


[12/6/2023 12:30 PM] .deciusmus
although they don't if you add "out of cycle" days


[12/6/2023 12:30 PM] .deciusmus
(which is how the mayans did it)


[12/6/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
so i had messed around with two intersecting cycles: 10 weeks per month, 5 months per year
3 extra days per month, 15 extra days per year


[12/6/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
the extra days count from 1 to 300


[12/6/2023 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
so every time the extra days start over at 1, you have a 20 year cycle


[12/6/2023 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
this is strongly inspired by the mayan calendar round


[12/6/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
with the mayan long count equivalent to the dwarven count of hours


[12/6/2023 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
but you could also do it without intercalary days by not sticking with a 7 day week


[12/6/2023 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
right what is interesting about the mayan calendar is 2 different ways of counting (reading wikipedia now) that intersect


[12/6/2023 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i was trying to go for the same feeling, but simpler to translate


[12/6/2023 12:36 PM] .deciusmus
i.e the 260 day cycle + the 365 day cycle


[12/6/2023 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
rather than each day having two names that cycle (one per year and one per less-than-year), you have the day/year combo be unambiguous, but the years themselves cycle based on the intercalary day names


[12/6/2023 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the strictly mayan style is a bit annoying for dwarves since we want CY years to exist and be equal in length to DR years (both 365 days). whereas my understanding of the mayan calendar is you don't have year numbers


[12/6/2023 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
right the mayan long count is just days in base 20


[12/6/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
what about

Cycle = 73 days = 5 per year
Each cycle has 36 days / middle day / 36 days
Each 36 day period is divided into 5 7 day weeks, with another middle day in between.

So the calendar goes

Cycle 1/partA/week1 - Cycle1/partA/week2 - middle day - Cycle1/partB/week3 - Cycle1/partB/week4 - middle middle - etc

Which, I think, is exactly what you proposed


[12/6/2023 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
But I'm not sure I'd think about names for "part a" and "part b"


[12/6/2023 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
I'd create names for the 5 cycles, and names for the days of the week


[12/6/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
then I'd use roman style naming:

14 days before 1st middle day
13 days...
1st middle day
14 days before middle middle
13 days before middle middle
middle middle
14 days before last middle
13 days before last middle..

etc


[12/6/2023 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
or split like to use days before / days after


[12/6/2023 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
14 days before 1st middle
...
1st middle
1 day after 1st middle
7 days after 1st middle
7 days before middle middle
...
middle middle
1 day after middle middle.
7 days before last middle
...


[12/6/2023 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
etc


[12/6/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
actually if you had names for the "1 day before... 7 day before" etc


[12/6/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
and had the intercalendary days repeat on a cycle


[12/6/2023 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
the day name would encode the year which might be interesting


[12/6/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think something like this makes sense just need to work out the details


[12/6/2023 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
the only problem is a 5 week cycle can't have an even. middle point that is between weeks


[12/6/2023 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
might be better to do two weeks / day / three weeks / day / two weeks day


[12/6/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
instead of dividing cycle into two parts


[12/6/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking a middle week


[12/6/2023 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
ah that works


[12/6/2023 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
messing around, one sec


[12/6/2023 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
actually that doesn't quite work. you have 10 weeks plus 3 days in a cycle


[12/6/2023 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
you could have (2w / 1d / 2w) (1w / 1d / 1w) (2w / 1d / 2w)


[12/6/2023 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
or you could have (2w / 1d ) (3w / 1d / 3w) (1d / 2w)


[12/6/2023 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
or you could just have (1 d / 5 wk / 1 d / 5wk / 1d)


[12/6/2023 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus
that is the most symmetric


[12/6/2023 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
but I think for 5 weeks to work it needs a name


[12/6/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
1 d / 5 wk / 1d / 5wk etc is your original proposal


[12/6/2023 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
a date could be:
year - cycle - (1-2) - (1-5) - (1-7)


[12/6/2023 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I was trying to layer in some roman idea around counting towards/away from the middle days


[12/6/2023 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is better for someone else than dwarves. i like dwarves being kind of mathematical


[12/6/2023 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g.


[12/6/2023 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
5881.2.1.5.3 = year 5881, 2nd cycle, 1st part, 5th week, 3rd day


[12/6/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
right, if you add a part it works


[12/6/2023 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think you need 5 parts


[12/6/2023 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, you just could days in each cycle/part combo from 1-35


[12/6/2023 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
rather than counting weeks + day of week


[12/6/2023 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
although if you have 5 parts nothing ever gets into double digits which is kind of pleasing


[12/6/2023 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
(except year)


[12/6/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
if you separate out the regularity of the week, I actually think the 36 / 1 could work fine


[12/6/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
you have a sequence of numbered incalendary days from 1 - 300 or whatever


[12/6/2023 1:04 PM] .deciusmus
the date is then

CY 4133 Cycle 1 35 days since day 256


[12/6/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
or 
CY 4133 Cycle 1 24 days after day 256


[12/6/2023 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
or 
CY 4133 Cycle 1 Day 256


[12/6/2023 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
but I guess the problem is that  week is, like in human calendar, not really part of the cycle of anything


[12/6/2023 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
might be nicer for dwarves to have the week be part of something


[12/6/2023 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
but you could have a 6 day week and then do

year.cycle.week.day

with one day each cycle that isn't part of a week


[12/6/2023 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
you could also do

2 weeks / 1 day / 2 weeks / 8 day middle middle week /  2 weeks / 1 day / 2 weeks

which keeps the idea of middles


[12/6/2023 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I like the date being year.cycle.(part).(week).day.(extra), and I don't think the dwarves should have a concept of units of time that are outside the cycle


[12/6/2023 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. weeks either don't exist or are regular within the cycle


[12/6/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I think that makes sense


[12/6/2023 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
but not sure exactly the correct arrangement of partts/weeks/extra days to make it work


[12/6/2023 1:18 PM] .deciusmus
if you are wedded to a 7 day week, 6 is a nice number


[12/6/2023 1:18 PM] .deciusmus
you get 6 cycles of 6 days in each cycle


[12/6/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
sorry, 12 cycles of 6 days


[12/6/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
or 6 x 6


[12/6/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
but your numbering could be

year.cycle(5/73days).week(12/6 days).day


[12/6/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
with 1 special day per cycle / 5 per year


[12/6/2023 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
that might work, although i like have a 7 in there somewhere as it seems natural to have something in the cycle associated with gods


[12/6/2023 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
the outer cycle has to be 5 to get 5*73


[12/6/2023 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so the 7 probably needs to be in the 73


[12/6/2023 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
unless the gods are part of the extra day rotation


[12/6/2023 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
you can get 7 extra days per month if you have 11 weeks of 6 days


[12/6/2023 1:22 PM] .deciusmus
"month = 73 day cycle"


[12/6/2023 1:22 PM] .deciusmus
(or 6 weeks of 11 days)


[12/6/2023 1:23 PM] .deciusmus
you could have

year.cycle.week(11/6 days each).day(1 of 6)
or
year.cycle.thuhr N

where each god repeats once per cycle, and the N increments once per cycle


[12/6/2023 1:23 PM] .deciusmus
so each year you have 5 traveller days, 5 ruler days, etc


[12/6/2023 1:24 PM] .deciusmus
you each have some akwardness where the days get inserted, or they need to be 6 weeks of 11 not 11 weeks of 6


[12/6/2023 1:26 PM] rsulfuratus
have meetings until 4 but will think on this a bit. definitely think the right option is somewhere in here


[12/6/2023 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, i need to go do some work as well


[12/6/2023 1:28 PM] .deciusmus
you could have

Thurhday - 2 weeks - Thuhr day - 2 weeks - Thurh day - 2 weeks - Thurday - 2 weeks - Thurh day - 2 week  - Thurday - 1 week - Thurday


[12/6/2023 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
it gives you one week per cycle (5 per year) which is close to 2 thuhr days


[12/6/2023 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
it gives lots of cycles of 5, which could be interesting, i.e. 5 cycles per year, 5 days to each thuhr per year, 5 "special weeks" per year, etc


[12/6/2023 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Here are the various prime factorizations for a 73 day cycle with X extra days:
1 extra day gives 72, which divides to 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3
2 extra days gives 71 (prime not useful)
3 extra days gives 70, which divides to 2 x 5 x 7
4 extra days gives 69, which divides to 3 x 23
5 extra days gives 68, which divides to 2 x 2 x 17
6 extra days gives 67 (prime not useful)
7 extra days gives 66, which divides to 2 x 3 x 11
8 extra days gives 65, which divides to 5 x 13
9 extra days gives 64, which divides 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2
10 extra days gives 63, which is 3 x 3 x 7


[12/6/2023 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
The only options I've found that fit a 73-day cycle and also have some kind of 7 somewhere are:
Six 11 day weeks per cycle with seven extra days: d w d w d w d w d w d w d
Ten 7 day weeks with three extra days: d (w w w w w ) d ( w w w w w ) d
Three 21 day months of three 7 day weeks each, with 10 extra days: d ( w d w d w ) d ( w d w d w ) d ( w d w d w ) d


[12/6/2023 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I did the same think basically, just slightly more informally


[12/6/2023 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
7 10 day weeks or 11 6 day weeks also work if you are willing to mess about with the symmetry


[12/6/2023 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I like either six 11 day weeks with the 7 "thuhr days" inserted between each week, or ten 7 day weeks (each day named after a thuhr/god)


[12/6/2023 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
I personally like the 7 thuhr days


[12/6/2023 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I do to


[12/6/2023 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
*too


[12/6/2023 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
the only slight hesitation is it is almost too perfect


[12/6/2023 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
Well, you could have 6 day weeks, gives you the odd pattern


[12/6/2023 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i like the symmetry in a cycle, I just want an "outer cycle" as well


[12/6/2023 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
oh, you mean the 5x5


[12/6/2023 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/6/2023 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
but you could do 7x7 with the thuhr days


[12/6/2023 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
well, you intersincally have 5 of them per year, right?


[12/6/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
but you mean make the repeating cycle every 35 days


[12/6/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. Ruler 35 -> Ruler 1


[12/6/2023 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
so you have a 7 year cycle of thuhr days layered on top of the year


[12/6/2023 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/6/2023 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
well, something like that


[12/6/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
can tune the repeat unit of the outer cycle to get something longer or shorter


[12/6/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
so would dates be: year.cycle.day? Or year.cycle.week.day


[12/6/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd do the latter


[12/6/2023 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
with day 0 being the intercalary day


[12/6/2023 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
athought that doesn't quite work because there is one more intercalary day than weeks


[12/6/2023 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
so either year.(name of cycle).(number of week).(number of day) or year.(name of cycle).ruler 35


[12/6/2023 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right yeah that works


[12/6/2023 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
can tweak the exact representation but something like that


[12/6/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Which basically means for names just need to make up the names of the 5 cycles


[12/6/2023 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
might just call them dwarven word for first, second, third


[12/6/2023 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
etc


[12/6/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
It seems like 

year 5122, 2nd month, 3rd week, 11th day is a little short on names?


[12/6/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
but maybe its ok


[12/6/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean like november, december except in fake dwarvish


[12/6/2023 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
so they'd have names, the names just mean first month, second month, etc when translated


[12/6/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
right, I'm projecting into dwarvish


[12/6/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
I guess you could have weekday names on top of the cycle


[12/6/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. what does a dwarf say to his friend, let's meet next Thirdday?


[12/6/2023 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
that works for me, but then I wonder if you want names for months


[12/6/2023 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
you probably need names of the week because next eleventhday sounds weird


[12/6/2023 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
or maybe it is just "1 after ruler, 2 after ruler" etc


[12/6/2023 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. roman style


[12/6/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
right, actually that works


[12/6/2023 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe this:
Ruler
1 after ruler
2 after ruler
3 after ruler
4 after ruler
5 after ruler
Ruler midweek
5 before priest
4 before priest
3 before priest
2 before priest
1 before priest
Priest


[12/6/2023 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
the only slighty asymettric bit is that there are two thuhr days in a row between one cycle and the next, so there is one thuhr, which ever is last, that never gets the "after" days


[12/6/2023 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
the other point I guess is that the romans used these instead of day #, not instead of names for days of the week


[12/6/2023 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
ie. Friday the 6th kalends


[12/6/2023 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/6/2023 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
but probably no need to actually make up dwarven weekday names


[12/6/2023 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand I could see no real need for days of the week names in dwarven. maybe within each cycle you'd just say 2.6 or 3.4


[12/6/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe the middle day of the week has a special name and conventionally the thuhr days and the middle days are rest days


[12/6/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, for the purposes of calendars and dates, I think it doesn't matter. 

A CY date is

Year.(Month, named, maybe "Firstember style").number.number OR
Year.(Month, named, maybe "Firstember style").thuhr number


[12/6/2023 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
if you wanted to invent dwarven day names they could be dervied from something like 5 before, 4 before, on, 1 after, 2 after


[12/6/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
where the dots are not intended to be necessarly the separator


[12/6/2023 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
right although the number after the thuhr is not needed to uniquely specify a day w/i a year


[12/6/2023 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
it just specifies a year within a 7 year cycle


[12/6/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/6/2023 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
I guess whether the style is

year.named month.thuhr
year.named month.thuhr number
or just
year.thuhr number

is up for grabs. They all uniquely specify a date


[12/6/2023 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
still going to think on this a bit, but I think this is the basic framework. not 100% sure about the thuhr number yet. feels like with thuhr days you kind of already have a nice concept that doesn't need the extra cycle tacked on


[12/6/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
sure, year.named month.thuhr could be were it lands

[12/6/2023 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
well, actually, no


[12/6/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
so the 76th day of 4133?


[12/6/2023 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
that's backwards


[12/6/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
1/1/4133 is march 17, dR 1


[12/6/2023 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
right so 1/1 DR is a late date in 4132


[12/6/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/6/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
the code i pushed last night gets the conversion correct from years since creation


[12/6/2023 9:03 PM] rsulfuratus
3-17-1749 should be 1-1-5882


[12/6/2023 9:03 PM] rsulfuratus
3-17-1748 should be 1-1-5881


[12/6/2023 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
Etc


[12/6/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
but it seems to be reporting CY 4133-08-35.2 for DR 1 / 1/ 1


[12/6/2023 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Hmm


[12/6/2023 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe I messed something up


[12/6/2023 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I was testing with jsfiddle and it was correct


[12/6/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
What does report for DR 1748-3-17


[12/6/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
5881.1.1


[12/6/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
it gets that right


[12/6/2023 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
So yes I think I got the year drankor was founded wrong then


[12/6/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
are you sure the year isn't just off by 1


[12/6/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
Well the year for 1748 is correct


[12/6/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
Don’t know how it could get one year wrong and another right


[12/6/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
because year 1 doesn't count


[12/6/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
there is no year zero


[12/6/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
Ah hmm maybe


[12/6/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
so the dates of 4133 and 5881 can't both be correct


[12/6/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
there is 1 too many years in between them


[12/6/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
because the years are counted inclusive of 1, i.e. year 2 is actually only 1 year old, so to speak


[12/6/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, there are 1748 years between 4133 and 5881 but only 1747 years between 1 and 1748


[12/6/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
easiest to just say Drankor was founded in late 4133 instead of late 4132


[12/6/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
That is what I meant


[12/6/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
When I said I got the date wrong


[12/6/2023 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/7/2023 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
added a few more status tags:
- **status/mike**, **status/tim**: this note needs a quick review from whoever (probably) created it to make sure tags and frontmatter are correct (used primarily for, e.g., deleting status/unknown from notes that appear complete but might have non-Obsidian information to add, or for adding dates/organizations/whereabouts/other information to pages you are pretty sure but not certain of)
- **status/images** for pages that might benefit from additional of some images or descriptive text


[12/7/2023 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to clean up status/unknown; if I am not sure about correct tag will change to status/mike, for example, instead of leaving status/unknown


[12/7/2023 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
doing a bit of work on Dunmar notes while I eat lunch and increasingly clear I think that political and geographic notes don't quite intersect completely into a proper folder hierachy. 

i'm doing a test rearrangement of Central Lowlands to separate political units and geographic units

I'm actually not convinced the entire of regions is even quite correct but for now not messing with that


[12/7/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
I was wondering if it would make sense to change the metadata a bit. Specifically I think we care about 3 things:
- where the thing is in space (whereabouts, special rules about home vs away, chains)
- relationships (many to many, no chain)
- part of (one to many, chains)


[12/7/2023 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
Imagine you had a page Dunmar that was both a type place and type polity


[12/7/2023 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
Then you could say it is whereabouts is central lowland region and it’s part of nothing. Some town (Karawa) could in theory then have a whereabouts of (plains of Karawa) and a part of (Dunmar)


[12/7/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
It models things well and if part of could be dated handles a lot of cases around changes in political situation pretty well.


[12/7/2023 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
But it means it isn’t clear what you do with a whereabouts chain - do you follow whereabouts exclusively (which might often by not really what you want)?


[12/7/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
Or do you always prefer part of?


[12/7/2023 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
The western Cymea case suggests you’d like to prefer whereabouts


[12/7/2023 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
the complicated answer would be to have a filter string that controls this. I think you'd acutally generally prefer partOf but there are a few places where you'd likely prefer to follow whereabouts


[12/7/2023 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for Dunmar - which I'm working on the geography of - you don't want "Karawa, Dunmari Basin, Central Lowlands Region" you want "Karawa, Eastern Dunmar, Dunmar"


[12/7/2023 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, its almost like you want something in the filter string


[12/7/2023 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
for which to prefer


[12/7/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, what is the right status for "Worldbuilding" stuff?


[12/7/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda feel like everything in Worldbuliding\Brainstorming should just not have a status tag


[12/7/2023 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
+ WorldBuilding\High School notes


[12/7/2023 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
Thinking more about collaboration on status tags, I’d sort of prefer to keep it as:

status/needswork
status/factcheck
status/mike
status/tim
status/stub

Where needswork has a bunch of sub categories, means still under some kind of active work or needs active work. 

Fact check means there are things to confirm but they are facts elsewhere in Obsidian (session notes, etc) and so anyone can check them and remove the tag

Stub means this page probably only needs a header but whoever created the page or updated the status didn’t feel like filing in the details. Anyone who fills in header can remove tag


[12/7/2023 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
Then Mike / Tim means whoever is tagged should review and remove tag if happy


[12/7/2023 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
Or change it to needs work if it needs additional work


[12/7/2023 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
Name check is useful


[12/7/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
what's that for, exactly?


[12/7/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
a name that is being proposed?


[12/7/2023 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
A name that isn’t canonical yet


[12/7/2023 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Don’t think ~Place~ need name check tags


[12/7/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
who removes the name check tag though?


[12/7/2023 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
If it is “I like this name is it okay with you” that is status-Tim or sratus/mike


[12/7/2023 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
But I need some way to indicate “I just typed something and I want to let it sit for a bit”


[12/7/2023 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/7/2023 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
that makes a lot of sense


[12/7/2023 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
but how about you do status/namecheck, status/tim then?


[12/7/2023 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
or status/namecheck, status/mike, status/tim


[12/7/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
if it is also a name you want to run by me


[12/7/2023 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah that works


[12/7/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
the implication is that if I see something status/mike status/namecheck without the status/tim I can remove the namecheck if I like the name

👍

[12/7/2023 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
converse for you


[12/7/2023 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
is there any reason to keep ~xxx ~ naming on things with status/namecheck


[12/7/2023 4:51 PM] .deciusmus
specifically the Sayuna Islands


[12/7/2023 4:51 PM] .deciusmus
to me ~XXX~ means XXX is a purely descriptive term for a place on the map with no ideas


[12/7/2023 4:52 PM] .deciusmus
if someone has a bunch of name ideas, add them to the note or discuss. One proposed/prefered, rename note and add status/namecheck


[12/7/2023 4:52 PM] .deciusmus
but no need to have ~xxx~


[12/7/2023 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
agreed


[12/7/2023 4:54 PM] rsulfuratus
well, I often use ~Conclave War~ or something like that when writing a different note, to give something a temporary name. in that case when the note gets created ideally whoever creates the note should delete the ~~ and add status/namecheck


[12/7/2023 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, that makes sense


[12/7/2023 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
Any objection to bulk-removing status tags from everything under Worldbuliding/High School Notes and Brainstorming?


[12/7/2023 4:56 PM] rsulfuratus
no


[12/7/2023 4:56 PM] rsulfuratus
although I think we should probably separate "background" from "brainstorming" because status tags are useful on the background stuff


[12/7/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[12/7/2023 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
Specifically I am talking about the High School Notes and Brainstorming folders only


[12/7/2023 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[12/7/2023 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
at some point I might also reorganize worldbuilding and pull the stuff that is world info but really more background from the stuff that is brainstorming/note dumps


[12/7/2023 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/7/2023 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, that is what Background vs Brainstorming is supposed to be


[12/7/2023 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right I was just thinking that should probably be a top level distinction


[12/7/2023 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[12/7/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
if I move a file does it break your secrets stuff?


[12/7/2023 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
shouldn't as long as you don't rename it


[12/7/2023 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
I want to move the "Unusual Races" doc to Brainstorming from the root of Worldbuilding but it hs a secret


[12/7/2023 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
test it


[12/7/2023 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
works fine


[12/7/2023 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
it is really easy to get sucked into making up details and perfecting the pages of random npcs


[12/7/2023 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. my current obession is drainage basins


[12/7/2023 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
heh


[12/7/2023 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to make dinner but I just spent ~5 minutes making up the backstory of an NPC my PCs already killed 🙂


[12/7/2023 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
I flagged a handful of pages status/tim where I cleaned them up and assume they are complete but am not sure


[12/7/2023 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
messing around some more with my central lowlands project, i'm not actually sure it makes sense for places to have whereabouts. 

for example, I now have the Dunmari Basin, which lowland plains  bounded by the Sentinels/Myraeni Gap in the north/northwest, the Copper Hills/Yuvanti in the south/southwest, and the Garamjala Plateau in the east


[12/7/2023 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
there is also the desolation of cha'mutte, which is the large region covering the plaguelands, the nashtkar, the garamjala, and the area south of the plateau


[12/7/2023 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
the nashtkar, the blasted plain, is the eastern part of the Dunmari Basin


[12/7/2023 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so Kharsan is a location that is in:
a) the Dunmari Basin
b) the Nashtkar


[12/7/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
th Nashtkar being defined roughly as the part of the Dunmari Basin that overlaps the Desolation of Cha'mutte


[12/7/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
so, you could get away with it for Kharsan, it is in Nashtkar


[12/7/2023 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but what is the Nashtkar in? it is both Desolation of Cha'mutte and Dunmari Basin


[12/7/2023 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
i actually think places just need affiliations and you follow the "primary" chain


[12/7/2023 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but for clarity we might just use partOf for this and just reuse some of the affiliation code for generating the chains


[12/7/2023 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway nothing I want to revise immediately


[12/7/2023 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
just some idle thoughts


[12/7/2023 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
what's the goal of having a place be part of two things?


[12/7/2023 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
is it to generate a listing of places in the desolition of cha'mutte? just to record accurate metadata?


[12/7/2023 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
well at the moment it is just to have accurate metadata


[12/7/2023 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i think there are a couple of possible use cases, though


[12/7/2023 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
one is just getting lists of places in regions. the value of this decays as the region gets bigger and bigger


[12/7/2023 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but there is no reason in principle this has to happen at a high level of abstraction


[12/7/2023 9:44 PM] rsulfuratus
the more detail that exists the more you get overlapping features at all levels of any kind of abstract hierachy


[12/7/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
you can even see it in a place like tollen. if I had a page for Guy Marchand's shop, should it be on Scrollwright Street or in the ward its in (I think Godhome)


[12/7/2023 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
since Scrollwright Street spans wards, you have to pick one


[12/7/2023 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
again, just kind of idle thought - it might not be worthwhile to change, and maybe the best policy is to just use wherabouts for the thing you want the chain to follow


[12/7/2023 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/7/2023 9:50 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like there is something missing from the metadata but I'm not quite sure what it is...


[12/7/2023 9:58 PM] rsulfuratus
on a separate topic, I like Twilight's Grace for Ethlenn


[12/7/2023 9:58 PM] rsulfuratus
not quite sure about the moon in the feywild yet. how important is that to know soon?


[12/7/2023 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
I have a PC researching legends of the fey, and he rolled incredibly well. They are on a dungeon crawl right now that will take them one more session to finish, but I probably need to come up with something for him to have figured out by my Jan session


[12/7/2023 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
He is the dwarven lunar sorcerer, so he is specifically interested in what, if anything, the moon and the feywild have to do with each other


[12/7/2023 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
ah


[12/7/2023 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
don't need to give him real answers per se, because there is only so much he can find in Cleenseau


[12/7/2023 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
but it would be good to have some context to make up half-truths


[12/7/2023 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I wrote this kind of on a whim when I wanted to do something different for one of my intros (around the Empty Moon / werewolf arc) and I haven't quite figured out what it means yet


[12/7/2023 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus

[12/7/2023 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
what is key is the idea of extraplanar tides


[12/7/2023 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
this is also now canonically part of elven lore, albeit on a different time scale


[12/7/2023 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, my sorceror gets a different bonus spell in the new vs full moon


[12/7/2023 10:05 PM] rsulfuratus
what i am not sure is if the moon is responsible for extraplanar tides on taelgar, does it really make sense for it to actually exist on other planes?


[12/7/2023 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
on the theory that during the full moon its divine/outer planes, during new moon it is fey/inner planes


[12/7/2023 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
right that makes sense and is consistent with lore


[12/7/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
right, you are wondering about this line: " rising bright rising moon. "


[12/7/2023 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
I forgot i wrote that


[12/7/2023 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/7/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
stars probably work better actually


[12/7/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't want Twilight's Grace to feel gloomy


[12/7/2023 10:07 PM] .deciusmus
so that moon line was just throwaway


[12/7/2023 10:08 PM] .deciusmus
happy to change that


[12/7/2023 10:08 PM] rsulfuratus
it is kind of an important decision that seems like it is hard to go back on so want a bit of time to puzzle it out


[12/7/2023 10:09 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, sure


[12/7/2023 10:09 PM] rsulfuratus
agree twilight's grace shouldn't feel gloomy


[12/7/2023 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
but also light could work differently in the feywild. no need for a visible source of moonlight to have moonlight


[12/7/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[12/7/2023 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
I could also imagine a faint glow on the horizon and a spray of stars, like the milky way above


[12/7/2023 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway i deleted namecheck but will leave status/tim to remind me to think about it a bit.


[12/7/2023 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of like the faint glow on the horizon and a spray of stars imagery


[12/7/2023 10:13 PM] .deciusmus
I rewrote it like:


The realm of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. A land of perpetual twilight, but full of sparkling lights, music, and games.

%% 

Note: Could potentially have a moonlight connection, but unclear if there is a moon in the Feywild. For now avoid reference/mention of moon until this is determined.

[12/7/2023 10:18 PM] rsulfuratus
btw, Akan is a perfect example of how a "with" would be useful. I wrote out the chronology because I wanted a record somewhere of the general ebb and flow of Karawa area refugees during the early part of the campaign


[12/7/2023 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus
but really this should go on an events page (part of the gnoll attacks), and then all the people who are moving together can just be with xxx


[12/7/2023 10:19 PM] rsulfuratus
where xxx is probably someone like the priestess of the five sibling temple in karawa or another kind of "city leader" type


[12/7/2023 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus
of this:
```
- (DR:: 1748-03-22) *(Akan)*: Attacked with his extended family at the [[Gomat]] oasis by enraged giant lizards. One of the few survivors. 
- (DR:: 1748-03-23) *(Akan)*: Met the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] (who [[Session 2 (DuFr)|killed the lizards]]) while returning to camp to gather supplies for the ride to [[Karawa]]. They returned his sister's amulet to him (she was killed in the giant lizard attack), helped his family recover, and made a very favorable impression. 
- (DR:: 1748-03-27) *(Akan)*: Arrived in [[Karawa]] for the [[Festival of Rebirth]].
- (DR:: 1748-04-07) *(Akan)*: Leaves [[Karawa]] with Dunmari evacuation
- (DR:: 1748-04-13) *(Akan)*: Reaches [[Tokra]]
- (DR:: 1748-06-08) *(Akan)*: Leaves [[Tokra]] to return to [[Karawa]]
- (DR:: 1748-06-15) *(Akan)*: Returns to [[Karawa]] from [[Tokra]], for the [[Feast of Bhishma]]
- (DR:: 1748-06-22) *(Akan):* Returns to nomadic lifestyle traveling north and east of [[Karawa]] with his extended family and his diminished sheep herds.

[12/7/2023 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
only the first two should really be there, the rest should be part of a different page t


[12/7/2023 10:24 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I wasn't sure if writing out the whereabouts even made sense; I just did it to experiment


[12/7/2023 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
you could even have a with "the Karawa Refugees"


[12/7/2023 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/7/2023 10:25 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be even better


[12/7/2023 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda lost steam on dates, might need an easier coding project


[12/7/2023 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
with might be it


[12/7/2023 10:26 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is quite simple, you just copy the whereabouts from the with page


[12/7/2023 10:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/7/2023 10:26 PM] rsulfuratus
probably need a filter option as to whether you just copy (default) or whether you report "with XXX, whereabouts"


[12/7/2023 10:27 PM] rsulfuratus
because e.g. for halfling ships you probably want to code it as with, but displaying "on The Emerald Song, location"


[12/7/2023 10:27 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. the idea is that 

{ type: with, start: x, end: y, person: z }

means

go to page Z, get all of the whereabouts that were 'active' between x and y, and include them, but use type: away for all


[12/7/2023 10:27 PM] .deciusmus
I think we have a p/P for person


[12/7/2023 10:28 PM] .deciusmus
and oO iI


[12/7/2023 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus
right we already have that


[12/7/2023 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would cover all the use cases


[12/7/2023 10:28 PM] .deciusmus
I think the filters could use some rethinking though


[12/7/2023 10:28 PM] .deciusmus
specifically, the other thing I don't like is using whereabouts for item owners


[12/7/2023 10:29 PM] rsulfuratus
agreed


[12/7/2023 10:29 PM] .deciusmus
although maybe that is a use case for "with"


[12/7/2023 10:29 PM] .deciusmus
but it feels like overkill for most items, where you probably don't care aobut the location


[12/7/2023 10:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/7/2023 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. I want to be able to specify the owner of an item without caring about where it is


[12/7/2023 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
conceptually I think we need a "relationships" (which is really just affiliations, but a little broader)


[12/7/2023 10:31 PM] rsulfuratus
i actually wonder if an approach might just be to generalize the campaign info framework


[12/7/2023 10:32 PM] rsulfuratus
or maybe not that specifically


[12/7/2023 10:32 PM] rsulfuratus
more precisely basically allow any metadata to be either a string or an object with { name: start: end: }


[12/7/2023 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
then you could just have owner


[12/7/2023 10:33 PM] rsulfuratus
(maker is probably best as part of events)


[12/7/2023 10:35 PM] .deciusmus
Which is to say, I think, in general, we could model almost everything with:

* whereabouts (specifically refers to locations, has the concepts of home/away/with, not really one or many)
* relationships (which have start/end dates and types, refer to other pages that there is some kind of defined relationship with, many to many)
* interactions (or maybe events) (things which happened at a specific time and place, one to one)
* part of (a "bigger" thing of the same type this page is part of) (one to many)


[12/7/2023 10:35 PM] .deciusmus
Then "primary" org goes away, and becomes part of


[12/7/2023 10:35 PM] .deciusmus
campaign info goes away, and becomes interactions


[12/7/2023 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
You could imagine a handful of shorthands that define "quick" relationships:

maker: X => same as relationships: [ { type: maker, org: X }]
owner: X => same as relationships: [{ type: owner, org: X }]
leader: X => same as relationships: [{ type: leader, org: X ]}


[12/7/2023 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
(probably we'd want to rename org, or allow org/person/place interchangeably or something)


[12/7/2023 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems like it would be pretty good


[12/7/2023 10:40 PM] rsulfuratus
although I think partof should be many to many as well, but always same time


[12/7/2023 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus
partOf is just a specific kind of relationship that is useful to define separately


[12/7/2023 10:41 PM] .deciusmus
But it makes modelling something like an item pretty easy.

A really simple item is just owner: X

But if you wanted a complex artifact you could do:

whereabouts: (some long list, intermixed between "with" lines and "home" lines)
relationships: (maker, owner, etc)
interactions: (battle of X, destruction of Y)


[12/7/2023 10:41 PM] .deciusmus
See, I think you need some way of indicating "primary"


[12/7/2023 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
partOf is chain-following


[12/7/2023 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
which means it can't be many to many


[12/7/2023 10:43 PM] rsulfuratus
you just have a type: primary that you follow


[12/7/2023 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
In the model above, you have two chains you can follow:

* the whereabouts chain, which defines the current location
* the part of chain, which defines the "structure"


[12/7/2023 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
but what's the difference between partof and relationship then


[12/7/2023 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
nothing


[12/7/2023 10:45 PM] .deciusmus
I'd rather write:

Nasktar
partOf: Dunmari Basin
relationships: [ { type: region, location: Desoliation of Cha'mutte, start: 1545 }]


[12/7/2023 10:45 PM] .deciusmus
than
Nasktar
relationships: [ { type: region, location: Desoliation of Cha'mutte, start: 1545 }, { type: primary, location: Dunmari Basin } ]


[12/7/2023 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus
ah sure fair enough, that's a good idea


[12/7/2023 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
it also enforces the idea there can only be one primary


[12/7/2023 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
it could support dates but it wouldn't support overlap


[12/7/2023 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
and usually you wouldn't bother with dates


[12/7/2023 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
right, basically it is like a home whereabout style construction but for primary relationship


[12/7/2023 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
maybe for an important ruler who married into a different house, you might do

partOf: [ { name: House of Sewick, end: 1545 }, { name: House of Lils, start: 1546 } ]


[12/7/2023 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/7/2023 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
then, you can say that, in general, places never have whereabouts


[12/7/2023 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
Unless a place conceptually actually moves


[12/7/2023 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. a floating island


[12/7/2023 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
or, I guess


[12/7/2023 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
although


[12/7/2023 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
I guess there could be some advantage on political/nonpolitical


[12/7/2023 10:49 PM] .deciusmus
anyway, idle thoughts. Time for me to go to bed


[12/7/2023 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah me too


[12/7/2023 10:49 PM] .deciusmus
If I do anything soon on this it will be to implement with

{Reactions}
👍

[12/7/2023 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that is a useful incremental step that will help clear up whereabouts for a lot of NPCs


[12/8/2023 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
pushed a few bits and pieces of status update: tagged a bunch of pages "status/tim" from status/draft or similar if I read the page and think it is done


[12/8/2023 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
have break and am doing a bit of gazetteer reorganizing. curious which you prefer:
1) have the gazetteer top level remain regions, and have subdirectories for realms and geographic features in that region. pro: all the "stuff" for one area in one directory. con: the same river ends up with two different pages in two different regions (the Mahar, currently, has potentially three pages: Mahar, Istaros, Kulthul). 
2) reorganize gazetteer to separate out realms and geographic features, which can have different groupings. pro: allows more natural grouping of geographic features by topology and watershed. con: the page for ~Tokra Plains~ and Tokra are no where near each other
3) don't bother organizing the gazetteer by region at all, and have directories for rivers, forests, etc, and just rely on whereabouts/partof to make lists of things near each other. pros: easiest to sort new pages into. cons: requires tagging and dataview to work, might be hard to browse online


[12/8/2023 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
there are various intergrades too. for example rivers specifically could be handled separately, either by forcing region boundaries to conform to rivershed boundaries or by moving rivers out of the general region hierarchy


[12/8/2023 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus
my vague preference is #2, because I find having the March of Ardonne grouped with Dunmar a bit silly, but I also find having the Istaros and the Drogar, which are the same river, in two different regions to be a bit annoying.


[12/8/2023 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm


[12/8/2023 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
I think it is a good point that the current organization is a bit confusing


[12/8/2023 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
I think it is useful to be able to find things "nearby"  so I don't like #3


[12/8/2023 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
Broadly, I like how Western Green Sea is organized, which is basically:

Realm
Rivers
Roads
a few random pages for major geographic features

and then "small" geographic features live inside the realm directory


[12/8/2023 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that is in part an artifact of the kind of detail that has been invented for Sembara


[12/8/2023 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., the two things I'm working on mostly right now are the north coast of the western green sea and a reorg of Dunmar, and that organization doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense for either of those areas


[12/8/2023 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
in part because in both cases there is a lot of wilderness that is not part of any realm


[12/8/2023 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
I think the actual problem is that the the broad area bordered by Myrani Gap/Nevos Sea/Sentinals/Mostreve Hills/South Cymean Coast/Undefined Eastern Mountains/Sea of Storms (the "Istaros Watershed") really is across several different political units


[12/8/2023 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
and realms don't neatly line up with geographic features


[12/8/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
the plaguelands is a major political divide but not a geographic divide


[12/8/2023 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
right


[12/8/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
it would be completely neatly organized if you just moved everything south of the mostreve hills to the central lowlands


[12/8/2023 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
but that is annoying for different reasons


[12/8/2023 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
But actually the west coast has the same problem-- the major rivers stretch deep into the mountains


[12/8/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/8/2023 10:31 AM] .deciusmus
and if you are talking about geography/climate/watersheds you kinda want a different divide than politics a bit


[12/8/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that is kind of my suggestion above


[12/8/2023 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
political spheres of influence and geographic regions don't line up


[12/8/2023 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
I am just not totally sold on that from a "making things up" standpoint


[12/8/2023 10:36 AM] .deciusmus
Where do I put a page on the Aurbez Plateau? It is entirely within the refounded alliance...


[12/8/2023 10:36 AM] .deciusmus
but it is a geographic feature


[12/8/2023 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/8/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
so browsing some of the imo better D&D sourcebooks, it seems the usual solution is to just have super unrealistic maps with like 5% of the river systems the world would actually have


[12/8/2023 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think Taelgar doesn't have enough rivers! 🙂


[12/8/2023 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah it has way too few. i have a bunch of new dunmari rivers


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
although it has a decent number of trunks/main lines


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
Sembara feels good to me, ignoring the little brooks and streams


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
everything just needs about 20 more tributaries


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
actually the mapped areas are pretty good


[12/8/2023 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
I have a ton more rivers in the north coast too


[12/8/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
you'll see when you finally bother to go to Tollen and the kenku scout describes the area to wellby to map ;-0


[12/8/2023 10:39 AM] .deciusmus
heh 🙂


[12/8/2023 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess rivers are actually the major challenge in some sense


[12/8/2023 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think the right answer lies a bit in "why are you writing a page"


[12/8/2023 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I think there is fun/value in having well developed climate/geographic overview/river system pages


[12/8/2023 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
but I think those are kinda orthogonal to the "political units, small forests, little brooks, bridges, towns, ruined forts" type pages that give color to an are


[12/8/2023 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
sure but something like 90% of river pages are just stubs anyway to track a name


[12/8/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe it makes sense to just pull rivers (and maybe roads? less certain there) out of the region organization


[12/8/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
or at least, pull major watersheds that span political regions


[12/8/2023 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
this would basically be the chasa watershed and the hara/mahar/istaros watershed


[12/8/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
Right I think what I am suggesting is that I think having something ike:


Gazetteer
- Western Green Sea Region
--- Volta Watershed
--- Semb Watershed
--- Mostreve Hills
- Central Lowlands Region
--- Istaros Watershed
--- Dunmari Basin
- Green Sea Realms
--- Tollen
--- Sembara
- Dunmar
- Dwarven Realms
---- Nardith
- Chardonian Empire
---
- North Coast Realms
--- Mawar


[12/8/2023 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
could work


[12/8/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
Maybe that's too many folders though


[12/8/2023 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I can't decide if depth is better or worse than long lists though


[12/8/2023 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess I would say that the top level folders should aim to be a large grouping of subfolders that make sense to access together


[12/8/2023 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
Probably a strict organization is too hard


[12/8/2023 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
E.g., I want Dunmar in the Central Lowlands region because there is a lot of adjacent wilderness that is adventuring territory


[12/8/2023 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
or, you want those in the same folder


[12/8/2023 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
i prefer to keep the top level contents of any one folder to around 10 max


[12/8/2023 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Note that we don't attempt to do that for people at all


[12/8/2023 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah for people it seems less important because at least from a browsing perspective you are usually going to be going from a link


[12/8/2023 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
we also don't have folder pages for people for imo the same reason, you don't really click on "halflings" and then browse


[12/8/2023 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
originally we organized by species/ancestry for automation purposes, not sure that is still useful but nice to break things up somehow


[12/8/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
Not sure I want to think about people, but honestly its an area where a pretty flat list would probably be fine. What I actually want is to be able to see all the people in Cleenseau, but tagging+dataview works a lot better for that than folders


[12/8/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
right, not interested in reorging people now


[12/8/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
Back to places...


[12/8/2023 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
one challenge is that things get made up at weird levels of detail


[12/8/2023 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
I think to simplify the current issue before I get back to working on work: all I'd really like to decide right now is how to handle river systems that span regions, from three options:
1) pull large watersheds (for some definition of large) out of region folders entirely and organize watershed-related geographic features (primarily rivers) independently
2) move some river pages to be in the region hierarchy that is where the bulk of the river system is, even if that means there is a bit of annoying jumping back and forth for a handful of regions where the river system and the political sphere of influence don't line up (e.g., Elderwood rivers on the west coast and the Aurbez-area tributaries of the Istaros)
3) Just rely on linking with ![[]]. Have a master page for each river in the region where it is most contained and then for e.g. the Istaros just link the Mahar (doesn't work as well for tributaries)


[12/8/2023 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
4) something else


[12/8/2023 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
I like #1


[12/8/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
okay, yeah that is what I am leaning towards as well.


[12/8/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
I am going to pull istaros-mahar out into its own group and we can see how that works

{Reactions}
👍

[12/8/2023 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
easy to move pages back if needed


[12/8/2023 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not convinced that for climate description purposes it doesn't make more sense to tie the region to the watershed, but that is not a critical decision for right now


[12/8/2023 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
it does make more sense for sure


[12/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
probably the best organization is actually to have large scale geography (climate, mountains, rivers, large scale geographic features) organized separately from "regions"


[12/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
where "region" is more like "sphere of influence"


[12/8/2023 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
basically have a top-down structure and a bottom up structure


[12/8/2023 11:07 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, that is kinda what I was trying to describe above, but I don't think I quite hit it


[12/8/2023 11:07 AM] .deciusmus
but what you are saying makes a lot of sense


[12/8/2023 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
right, yeah


[12/8/2023 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
something like my page on Aurbez and the Ardonne probably belongs in the Istaros-Mahar watershed


[12/8/2023 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
I should have probably done this on a branch but too late now


[12/8/2023 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
whereas the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez belongs "near" Maseau and Sembara


[12/8/2023 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
eh, that's fine


[12/8/2023 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not in the middle of anything


[12/8/2023 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
just push at some point even if in progress because I have a 2 hr planning meeting this afternoon that I will probably ignore parts of and work on something or other


[12/8/2023 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
okay


[12/8/2023 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
what do you think of this?

Chasa-Nahadi Watershed
- the Chasa and Nahadi river systems (including lake valandros)
- all the forested slopes of the western sentinels
- deno'qai villages excluding northern deno'qai from delwath solo

Isataros-Mahar Watershed
- plaguelands
- xurkhaz
- all the rivers that feed into this large river system, excluding the hara
- the aurbez geographic region pages
- orenlas

West Coast
- Chardonian Empire
- Mawar
- rivers entirely contained within this region, including the Yeraad
- nevos sea
- geographic features w/i or near these areas and not already in the Chasa-Nahadi watershed

Dunmar Region
- all of Dunmar
- Hara river system
- Nashtkar
- Garamjala
- various geographic features contained entirely within this area
- Yuvanti and Nardith

Western Green Sea
(this is large, could be split, probably by moving skaerhem and vostok out and merging with ursk into a north green sea coast)
- all of "greater semabara"
- cymea
- vostok
- tollen
- skaerhem
- geographic features contained within these regions

Eastern Green Sea
- ursk
- irrla
- eastern islands
- medju

Far North
(stub)

South
(stub, just Kenzo solo)


[12/8/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
where are the sentinals?


[12/8/2023 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah just realized


[12/8/2023 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
they'd be a top-level directory


[12/8/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
I'd make them a top level folder


[12/8/2023 11:32 AM] .deciusmus
but looks good


[12/8/2023 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus
I have to get back to work by noon so I'm going to do a reorg then push

{Reactions}
👍

[12/8/2023 11:35 AM] .deciusmus
I'd actually be tempted to split Greater Sembara out into its own top level, with Cymea/Skaerhem/Vostok/Tollen as the "Western Green Sea"


[12/8/2023 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
you wouldn't put Tollen in Greater Sembara? seems like there are a lot of links there


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, probably


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
actually


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus
although also a lot of links between Tollen and Cymea


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus
but that is actually probably fine to span regions


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, I was originally thinking it has a lot more ties to the broader Green Sea than Sembara does


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
hence "western green sea"


[12/8/2023 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
but it is really a melting pot, which is always going to be wrong no matter who you group it with


[12/8/2023 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
conceptually though from a features point of view the north coast (skaerhem/vostok/ursk) is distinct from "greater sembara" (sembara/tyrwingha/highland/marches) and "western green sea" (tollen/cymea)


[12/8/2023 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
I think actually I'd prefer too many top level categories for now and we can collapse later so I might just to that


[12/8/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
then irrla/eastern islands/medju is eastern green sea


[12/8/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
Vostok doesn't feel north coast to me, the forests in central vostok stretch directly to the sembaran highlands


[12/8/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
guess that's true


[12/8/2023 11:41 AM] rsulfuratus
but parts of the coast is very skaer-influenced


[12/8/2023 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe it should just be one big thing


[12/8/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, it is a another melting pot


[12/8/2023 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
To me, making Greater Sembara top level is useful just to have less depth for my cleenseau pages


[12/8/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
i think right now I'm doing greater sembara just as highland kingdoms marches tyrwingha sembara


[12/8/2023 11:43 AM] .deciusmus
yeah that works


[12/8/2023 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
the tollen/cymea/skaerhem/vostok as western green sea


[12/8/2023 11:43 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/8/2023 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed


[12/8/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
keeps rivers together for the most part, main consequence is separating politics from geography for aurbez area and for chasa river valley. but i think that is fine


[12/8/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
(didn't move little brooks or anything, fat brook in tollen is still in tollen even though volta is in Greater Sembara)


[12/8/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
also makes the whole desolation of cha'mutte thing cleaner, since this is all in mahar-istaros watershed now

👍

[12/8/2023 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
might still shift a few things around (garamjala probably should move to mahar watershed from Greater Dunmar; might split the eastern and western halves of the far north so forest of nightmares and ursk aren't lumped together)


[12/8/2023 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but busy rest of day so won't mess around further until tonight or tomorrow, if then (need to do session notes and session prep for my low level minigame which wraps up sunday)

[12/8/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
I might mess around with Sembara org a bit


[12/8/2023 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[12/8/2023 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
and potentially rewrite the "Geography of Taelgar" page to better characterize the places


[12/8/2023 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
what is your feeling on ~xxx~ places? In Worldbuilding\Unnamed or "where they belong"?


[12/8/2023 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
where they belong


[12/8/2023 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
I might do a bit of that type of cleanup then as well

If I am listenting to a planning meeting I only 40% care about its perfect type of background task


[12/8/2023 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
Taelgar needs a couple of endorheic (not draining to ocean) drainage basisns


[12/8/2023 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
It's probably too big a change, but you could imagine that the upheaveal of the Yuvanti mountains /plaguelands disrupted the Istaros watershed and that actually the northern and southern halves are not connected


[12/8/2023 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
So the Andonne drains into the plaguelands but the Drogar and Kulthul rivers actually originate in the plaguelands or even the southern borders, ratehr than the Istaros actually flowing through


[12/8/2023 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
this isn't the right place for it. the dunmari basin, however, potentially is, if the hara is disconnected


[12/8/2023 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
which it might be. haven't decided yet


[12/8/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
would potentially create an interesting seasonal wetlands east of the yuvanti when the monsoon rains cause the hara to flood


[12/8/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
similar to some areas in southern sahara or the kalahari


[12/8/2023 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
actually that's very similar to the Otavangi (sp) delta in Namibia/Botswana


[12/8/2023 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/8/2023 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
did you push anything btw? I have like 10 minutes until my next meeting


[12/8/2023 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
no, I got distracted 
(a) thinking about rewriting Geo of taelgar
(b) fixing unit tests for work


[12/8/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus

[12/8/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I've been thinking about endorheic basins a lot. a little less than 20% of earths surface is endorheic, and they tend to require desert-like conditions to persist


[12/8/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
because otherwise the water just cuts through the barrier eventually


[12/8/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so e.g. the mahar is probably not a great place, there is too much water flowing through it


[12/8/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
but there is also likely a large endorheic basin in the great desert area


[12/8/2023 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
should have figured you would have read the wikipedia page already given your previously stated river basin obesssion


[12/8/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
equivalent to chad basin in north africa


[12/8/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
the thing taelgar really lacks is something like the giant himalayas / caspian sea basin


[12/8/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
yeah. the sentinals are fascinating because they have no large plateau around them. I don't think there is a good analoge on earth except maybe parts of the andes


[12/8/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
but they really just kinda push up from nowhere. clear evidence of no plate tectonics


[12/8/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
🙂


[12/8/2023 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
they are kind of rockies-inspired imo


[12/8/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
yeah but the rockies have 1000 miles of high plateau behind them


[12/8/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
maybe not quite 1000, but a lot


[12/8/2023 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
I tend to think of the Sembaran rivers as somewhat analogous to the India/Ganges river valley


[12/8/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
you have this wall-like set of mountains that arises out of almost flat land


[12/8/2023 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
really? then why are they called the highland kingdoms?


[12/8/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
they are like "lowland" nepal or bhutan or the highland indian provinces


[12/8/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
but they are pretty small


[12/8/2023 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
maybe that's wrong, I haven't thought about it super-carefully


[12/8/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
To me the Sembara river systems imply a pretty rugged hilly uplands


[12/8/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
you need spines of high terrain separting the river valleys


[12/8/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
otherwise you'd end up with Dunmar with just the Hara in the middle


[12/8/2023 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
doesn't have to be mountains but Sembara does not seem like a flat plain to me


[12/8/2023 3:22 PM] .deciusmus
what keeps the seine/loire/rhein/elbe as separate rivers?


[12/8/2023 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
hah that is just the map I was looking at

[12/8/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure what you have planned in the north, but it probably makes more sense to split the "Northern Green Sea" from the "Far North"


[12/8/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
Boundary would be a bit fuzzy but it would distinguish the stuff north west of Vostok and especially on the western side of the Sentinels from Ursk and the mountains north of Urks


[12/8/2023 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that makes sense


[12/8/2023 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Far North might not quite be the right title but the north coast of the green sea (extending from "Kenku Homeland" east to "Far North Peninsula") is definitely distinct from Pandar/Forest of Nightmares area


[12/8/2023 4:47 PM] .deciusmus
Realistically, there are probably 3 regions up there, the "northern green sea", the "far north" (which is basically polar/artcic regions), and the "north coast" or "north west" which includes forest of nightmares/pandar and the farther north coast


[12/8/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed some stuff to  a branch, geoupdates


[12/8/2023 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
not sure how I feel about it


[12/8/2023 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
a few things are misclassified but I basically like it. I was about to do something similar. my one major modification would be to keep things that are unmapped* in tentative


[12/8/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
by unmapped I mean things like "far north peninsula" or "north bay"


[12/8/2023 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
features that exist basically as coastline


[12/8/2023 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
i would also keep the southern continent and related in either brainstorming or tentative


[12/8/2023 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the only unmapped feature I'd include in the main gazetteer is the ~great desert~


[12/8/2023 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
Feel free to take over my branch or merge it and go from their


[12/8/2023 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
I thought the “there were two continents during hkar age” was canonical


[12/8/2023 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
either there were two continents or there was one continent that was split in two during the downfall


[12/8/2023 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure yet


[12/8/2023 6:32 PM] .deciusmus
Ah. Makes sense


[12/8/2023 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I am generally aiming to set river whereabouts to the watershed they are part of (although technically "partOf" is probably better here, but since that is all up the air not switching over yet). the aim being to make it easy to query a set of connected rivers. not sure how far I'll get tonight

What do you think about Zimka for the name of the highlanders? Zimkovia becomes the land

alternate ideas:  Vemkya and Vemkysk


[12/8/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus

or Vemkinsky


[12/8/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
don't like that as much


[12/8/2023 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
Zimka is intended to be evolved from Semb


[12/8/2023 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
very explicitly same root as Vostok could be 
Pemvos (the people of the Semb) Pemvora
also could use Kemvos Semvos Kambvos


[12/8/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
(Kem is already a river in Vostok so probably not that)


[12/9/2023 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
Vostok is supposed to be "homeland of the Vos", so people = Vos, land = tok. that gives you the ~English/Tollender translation Vosland and the variants Voslaag and Vosklad for "lowlanders" and "highlanders" which is then used synonymously with the name of the region (e.g. like Gauls/Gaul)


[12/9/2023 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
this wikipedia page is fascinating: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country-name_etymologies

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country-name_etymologies
List of country-name etymologies
This list covers English-language country names with their etymologies. Some of these include notes on indigenous names and their etymologies. Countries in italics are endonyms or no longer exist as sovereign political entities.


[12/9/2023 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
main reason to care is if you want to have an "indigenous" name and a "foreign" name, e.g. Skaergenland / Skaer Islands vs Skaerhem; Vosland vs Vostok


[12/9/2023 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
E.g. Zimland as the name used by Sembarans, Zimtovia or Zimkovia as the indigenous name


[12/9/2023 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus
my general take is that is most interesting from a game/worldbuilding perspective when you have distinct cultures close together that might clash. So no one would call Dunmar Dunland or whatever so we don't care about etymology, but some future adventure might for sure be interested in the political/cultural dimensions "Sembaran" vs "East-Northerner"


[12/9/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I was thinking Semvos would be "the people of the Sem"


[12/9/2023 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
Or whatever alternate, i.e. Pemvos Kambvos


[12/9/2023 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
so the "highlanders" would call themselves "Semvos" and the place Semkovia or whatever


[12/9/2023 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Ah right. Yes

do you remember what any of this means? I think it is your note


[12/19/2023 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
It was really raw brainstorming just trying to organize days


[12/19/2023 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
We had a long thread somewhere about different holiday ideas


[12/19/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I was just reading it, it is back in this history but it kind of peters out


[12/19/2023 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
or, rather, it is not consitent with the holidays we actually used (Viatela and Pyravela)


[12/19/2023 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing I took forward is this idea that there is a paired holiday in early/mid Jan to Viatela which is the “leavingtaking”


[12/19/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[12/19/2023 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
that is probably no later than first week of Feb, and with three major-ish holidays in a row probably means Feb/March fairly empty


[12/19/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
Also I still think having non-god-based “local” remembrance days is a key part of sembaran Mos Numena


[12/19/2023 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I haven’t sent a canonical date but after Jan 6th, which is the current date in my game. Also envisioned it as minor


[12/19/2023 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
right. still probably think there is likely no universal Mos Numena holiday between the leave-taking holiday and the vernal equinox


[12/19/2023 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, agreed


[12/19/2023 8:31 PM] .deciusmus
I think I was trying to work out if there should be a holiday for each god - kinda leaning towards not


[12/19/2023 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
probably not universal holidays for each god


[12/19/2023 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
I remember having some ideas for a couple of key holidays, one to the Night Queen which is an overnight event of some kind, I think we brainstormed about it earlier in this thread; the other was the idea that there is a legalistic "binding day" of sorts holiday to the father, which might have some legal bearing (i.e. around age of maturity)


[12/19/2023 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, there are a few ideas floating around


[12/19/2023 8:34 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly though just wanted to figure out if there would be a major holiday between say Feb 1st and March 15, which I think probably the answer is no


[12/19/2023 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
might think about a vernal equinox holiday in case you get really distracted and don't leave tollen until after March 21st...but have enough other session prep to do it is a bit easier to not worry to much about big holidays


[12/19/2023 8:35 PM] .deciusmus
I do need to set a canonical date for the leavingtaking holiday; but late Jan would suit well


[12/19/2023 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
a month after leaving taking would be probably too close to pyravela, but maybe 6 weeks


[12/19/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
6 weeks would be Jan 22nd


[12/19/2023 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
7 weeks Jan 29


[12/19/2023 8:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess depends on whether this is true or not:

In the urban parts of Hkar – the culture of Mos Numena, that eventually becomes the culture of Drankor – you have a system that grows up around magical cycles, with the 7 day week being of fundamental importance. A ritual cycle of 50 weeks, with 15 intercalary days (10 following the winter solstice; 3 on and around the summer solstice; 1 at the autumnal equinox, 1 at the vernal equinox), forms the basis of the urban Hkar year. For convenience, the 50 weeks are split into 10 groups of 5 weeks (months). Because a solar year in Taelgar is exactly 365 days, there are no leap years in this calendar, and it never goes out of sync (which also means the dates of the solstices and equinoxes never change).


[12/19/2023 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I think we decided that Dec 11 was just kind of an arbitrary date which had had significance to Drankor or even further back


[12/19/2023 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
I like the above being true, actually


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right at least the intercalary stuff is important as pyravela is the remnants of the old marking of the time between years


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
Vitatela is 10 days before the solstice


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that has a nice symmetry


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
not a perfect week but that is fine


[12/19/2023 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
well, the solstice is 10 days before the end of the year


[12/19/2023 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
so it has a symmetry


[12/19/2023 8:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
and with 50 weeks / 10 months / 7 days in a week it seems like holidays hitting the cyclic numbers probably makes some sense from  Hkarian mysticism standpoint


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I was actually thinking about 50 days after Dec 11


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
instead of a number of weeks


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be Jan 30th


[12/19/2023 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
that works


[12/19/2023 8:43 PM] .deciusmus
For reference medieval England had ~40 - 60 feast days a year


[12/19/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
i think this is one area where less realism actually feels more real in a way


[12/19/2023 8:44 PM] rsulfuratus
from a game point of view, anyway


[12/19/2023 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah,  I don't disagree. But I also think there is space for a place like Tollen (or perhaps even more so a place like Embry) to have a dozen local feast days on top of the dozen more universal ones


[12/19/2023 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think from a game point of view the idea would be there is a ritual calendar that is fairly universal and then on top of that you can pretty much just plop a feast day in any time you want


[12/19/2023 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[12/19/2023 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but a lot of the time adventurers are above those local feasts


[12/19/2023 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so they kind of happen in the background


[12/19/2023 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
right, agreed. Or in a place like Tollen, they might even be specific to a ward


[12/19/2023 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/19/2023 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
I do think the Mos Numena ritual calendar should be spaced by 50s and 70s and 10s days and 5 weeks and 7 week type numbers. I also think we established it isn't highly tied to the solstice/solar cycle. Maybe there are explicitly no holidays are in the intercalendary days of Hkar


[12/19/2023 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
7 weeks after Jan 30 is Mar 19 which could be a good day for the next big-ish holiday


[12/19/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
I also think at least one, if not two of the main universal holidays should be tied back to universal miracles, not specific gods


[12/19/2023 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps something about the birth of humanity


[12/19/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps something about Hkar and the downfall (maybe?) or the founding of Drankor in some sense/survival of humanity in those times


[12/19/2023 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
right, i think the idea is that there really isn't much difference between winter solistic and summer solistic in the tropics


[12/19/2023 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so it isn't a big marker of things


[12/19/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/19/2023 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
might just do 10 intercalary days at winter solistice and 5 at summer


[12/19/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
pyravela is part of the intercalary days after the winter solsitce so there can't be no holidays in that period


[12/19/2023 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
there definitely should be a holiday marking reaching the shores safely


[12/19/2023 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
you are going for 15 days to get exactly 50 weeks, right?


[12/19/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/19/2023 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
without getting sucked into another big calendar discussion, what's the advantage of that?


[12/19/2023 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly i just like the symmetry, exactly 50 weeks works out well for allowing a variety of different ritual cycles inside it


[12/19/2023 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
So what about just forgetting about the solar dates at all?


[12/19/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea is that somehow this is tied to various lost magical rituals, which given that extraplanar tides are thing probably also have some connection to the solar year


[12/19/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
after all it isn't entirely clear what the sun even is


[12/19/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
Say that the Hkar calendar was 50 weeks, running Jan 7th - Dec 23rd, which 15 day "winter" outside the calendar, of which Pyravela is the 3 day "middle"


[12/19/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
so you have the year,  then 6 days, then pyravela, then 6 days, then the year repeats


[12/19/2023 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
that actually has a nice symmetry to it


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
although on Hkar the entire 15 days would have ritual significance, only the middle part has been retained


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of think the traveler holidays (leave taking and home coming) might date to drankor, not Hkar


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I was thinking that as wel


[12/19/2023 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
only problem is that Drankorian year starts on Jan 1 not Jan 7th


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
right but that makes sense


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
the intercalendary dates are not retained


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right of course


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
and it is perfectly logical, I think (or at least, not particularly weird) to -- if pyravela is what is retained -- have that be the end of the year


[12/19/2023 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that actually works really well


[12/19/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
so it isn't so much that Drankorian calendar starts on Jan 1, it is that it starts the day after Pyravela, which appens to be Jan 1


[12/19/2023 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, the Hkaran people wouldn't have said "our calendar starts on the 7th". It starts on the 1st, obviously 🙂


[12/19/2023 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[12/19/2023 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
It's just that the Drankorians keep pyravela as the end of year, which is why on the "modern" calendar all the ancient holidays are 7 days later than they "should" be


[12/19/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
pasting this into https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anb-F8574X5BJbA4o1oeSRIuNveaXB--u21Owbd9LTA/edit


[12/19/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
and as usual this has become a discussion totally useless for session prep 😛


[12/19/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but I like the end result


[12/19/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
well, to tie it back to session prep, imagine that there are major holidays to 5 of the gods, plus Pyravela


[12/19/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
You get one every 70 days


[12/19/2023 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
(why do 2 of the gods not have holidays? well because the Sibyl's holiday is secret and ... need to think of another god to drop)


[12/19/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
That would work out to 

March 18
May 27
Aug 5
Oct 14
Dec 23


[12/19/2023 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
which actually doesn't quite work, because we definitely don't have a holiday on Dec 23


[12/19/2023 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, and that is kind of too close to pyravela


[12/19/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the vibe of the urban Hkar culture from which mos numena grew is a little more esoteric and also deeply magical. like, I'm not sure you really have too many festivals to the gods, you have the week of fire marking the time when it is auspicious to conduct summonings and spells that connect to the elemental plane of fire


[12/19/2023 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
right


[12/19/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
i think for the urban hkar culture everything was just "magic"


[12/19/2023 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
the divine weren't necessarily privelged


[12/19/2023 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
but then why does it matter for holidays at all?


[12/19/2023 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure it does. I think the Drankorians take some Hkaran holidays and turn them into opportunities for conversion


[12/19/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so there is that connection


[12/19/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but the holidays they take might only later become assocaited with mos numena in particular


[12/19/2023 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
the Drankorians, as opposed to the urban Hkarans, were definitely much more missionary


[12/19/2023 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, one option is to basically pick 8 - 12 dates and just make up holidays at a somewhat random spacing, and a couple of them might have ancient roots (Pyravela) but who knows


[12/19/2023 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think that is probably better than trying to tie everything to the hkaran calendar


[12/19/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
In which case, I'd say, if you need a holiday for Tollen make it the miracle of surviving the downfall


[12/19/2023 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
in mid-late March


[12/19/2023 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that could work


[12/22/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
I'm trying to come up with some fey legends about Ethlynn and Lord Umbraeth for my PCs to discover next session (Jan 7th)... 

I want a mix of truth, maybe true, and somewhat definitely not true...


[12/22/2023 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
I assume you don't have any strong feelings about why Umbraeth left Twilight's Grace or Ethlyn's personality?


[12/22/2023 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
Here are some ideas I have so far...

A story or legend about a lover's quarell between them - definitely false
Something about a time when Umbraeth was in Twilght's Grace during a competition of some sort, that he was in charge of, but rigged, which upset Ethyln
A story or legend about Duskmire growing bigger "recently"


[12/22/2023 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm about to do errands but will think a bit


[12/23/2023 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
here's what I have for fey stuff right now, btw:

My players are going to discover 4 documents:

1) A letter for the Oracle of the Red in Tyrwingha to warlocks of the Mostreve Army warning that Lord Umbraeth sometimes sends his Hands of Gloom (perhaps need a better name) to the mortal realm to try to trick anyone aligned to Ethlynn into swearing an oath to leave the area -- but don't fall for it, they have no power as long as you don't enter Duskmire. 

2) A report from the elf you made up to the Rangers about the Bogblight, which I need to make up, but is some kind of fey incursion from Duskmire that they helped deal with

3) A book of stories written as an instruction manual for a bard or other storyteller, with marginal notes and such on when the audience should laugh/cry/etc. There are three relevant tales here---
One about a Arryn I


[12/23/2023 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
One about Arryn i's second life in twlights grace, highlighting his place in Ethlyns court


[12/23/2023 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
One about an ancient love story between Ethlyn and Umbraeth


[12/23/2023 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
One about the Twilight Revel, a time of games of skill/festivities/dancing in Twilight's Grace, which talks about Umbraeth's role (somewhat masked) in organizing some of the games


[12/23/2023 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
4) An excerpt from a Insinguese translation of an Cymean polemic about the decline of proper language and grammar from about 150 years after the fall of Drankor, castigating the grandees of Cymea for not keeping up "proper" Drankorian customs and speech. The interest is that is full of examples of brilliant and wonderful Drankorian writing, one of which is a page from *On the Feywild* (or perhaps a moreinteresting name) that is a drankorian book that outlines places in the feywild


[12/23/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
The key info from #4 is a description of the borders and portals to the Duskmire, and in particular, I want the PCs to know that the portal near Cleenseau is new


[12/23/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
However, I might need to change #4 a bit as I'm not sure when Amberglow fell -- although it might be ok if it predates Amberglow falling


[12/23/2023 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
Duskmire was originally a small kingdom wedged between Amberglow, Twilight's Grace, Dreamhaven, and some unnamed fey kingdom that covers the heartland of Sembara (for various in game reasons I don't want Duskmire to be congruent with the heartland of Sembara)


[12/23/2023 3:25 PM] .deciusmus
It grew significantly to the south when the Cloudspinner was imprisoned, and more when the disruptions of the Great War


[12/23/2023 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
So actually having the Drankorian text describe Duskmire as a small realm nestled to the north of Amberglow, with only a single known portal somewhere in the Sentinels near Ulrich Pass, works pretty well


[12/26/2023 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus
thinking about your feywild stuff


[12/26/2023 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus
amberglow fell around 1000 DR


[12/26/2023 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
although the exact timing could be fairly uncertain as it may have persisted in some form for some time after cloudspinner's disappearance


[12/26/2023 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
more in a bit


[12/26/2023 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus

[12/26/2023 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
this is kind of rough but I guess I'm not fully understanding the geography you are imagining? especially if the Cleanseau portal is new - that is too far north to be former Amberglow territory IMO


[12/26/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
Amberglow probably never really extended north of Insingue


[12/26/2023 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
Shimmersong could easily extend a bit east, across the Aurbez plateu, and Duskmire could be in the Darkwood area


[12/26/2023 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
fey geography doesn't need to perfectly match the material plane especially as a far as distances are concerned


[12/26/2023 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
Here's the geography I was imagining....

Original:

Duskmire stretches from the border of Twilights Grace west as far as the Sembaran Wall, south as far as the northern Mostreve Hills, and north as far as the Wistel


[12/26/2023 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
Between the fall of Amberglow and the disruptions of the Ulrich Pass, it has now grown, and roughly runs from the Andonne/Darkwood in the south and east, to the Wistel in the North, and as far west as Dreamhaven


[12/26/2023 1:16 PM] .deciusmus
Although I suspect Lord Umbraeth is somewhat welcoming to refugees and fugitives and sketchy types exiles from other places for bad behavior or whatever, and that the edges - and especially the western and southern edges - of his realm are somewhat of a loose confederation of allies


[12/26/2023 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
In Drankorian days ,the only portal to Duskmire that the Drankorians knew about was in the Sentinels west of the Mostreve Hills. The Cleenseau portal definitely was never Amberglow, it is a new portal to Duskmire


[12/26/2023 1:18 PM] .deciusmus
The key thing is that there is something to the north of Duskmire that checks Lord Umbraeth's ambitions or expansion


[12/26/2023 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
And actually his original realm could have been entirely south of the Enst. Maybe there was a fey kingdom that was nestled into the mountains east of Dreamhaven that was distrupted by Cha'mutte's death


[12/26/2023 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Let me take a step back. Ultimately for my game I want Duskmire to:
(a) have expanded recently (ideally to include Cleenseau recently, although certainly since the Great War, and "recent" could be 100s of years ago)
(b) bordered by something odd and interesting in the west, Twilight's Grace in the east, something to the north that prevents expansion, and the shifting and chaotic borders of Amberglow to the south


[12/26/2023 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
i'm not sure how much you want to leave undeveloped in the Semaran feywild, but..


[12/26/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
Here is one idea...

Thousands of years ago, when Umbraeth was exiled from Twilight's Grace, he established/took over/something a small kingdom, labeled D on this map:

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1059870250440593520/1189281114813124740/image.png?ex=678b5119&is=6789ff99&hm=d9dc38c574876a229043a90aa2b2632f4d41c0d1064c26a22bf70294ab07eb77&


[12/26/2023 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps it was even a bit smaller, not covering the Darkwood


[12/26/2023 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
On the borders were two other fey realms (labeled 1 and 3) which today don't exist.

Realm 3 was an ally of Ethlenn's in some fashion, and Umbraeth tricking/killing/imprisoning/exiling/something him/her/them was the thing that lead to truly bad blood between them. 

So at some point, Duskmire expanded northward to cover the lands between the Andonne and Wistel, basically.


[12/26/2023 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
Then, when Cha'mutte died, some echo/something disrupted Realm 1. No idea what exactly (although actually, what if Cha'mutte's death somehow opened a connect to the Far Realms near Ulrich, and there is some kind of blight spreading - or perhaps not really spreading but just present - in all of the echo realms near Ulrich)


[12/26/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
So now it looks like this:


[12/26/2023 2:06 PM] .deciusmus

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1059870250440593520/1189283195552813056/image.png?ex=678b5309&is=678a0189&hm=9a844dc4867782e1ec9c3abed1c2ff52e6a094b5e3bcac0277a0cae643e74c00&


[12/26/2023 2:07 PM] .deciusmus
Realm 4 on the first map has expanded west a bit and is some sort of powerful fey who Umbraeth doesn't dare mess with


[12/26/2023 2:07 PM] .deciusmus
(now labeled 2, and not intentionally different from 1st map, just sloppy drawing, other than expanded to the west)


[12/26/2023 2:08 PM] .deciusmus
Duskmire (now in red) has grown substanitially


[12/26/2023 2:08 PM] .deciusmus
and realm 1 (now in black) is empty/strange/far-realm infested/shrunk/something


[12/26/2023 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
Darkwood is underdetermined, I realize I drew it a bit inconsistently, it could be part of Umbraeth's domain or it could be separate


[12/26/2023 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this basically works. I haven't yet completely worked out what actually happened when Cha'mutte died but this will likely be connected somehow to future Isingue adventure so I'd leave that uncertain and mysterious for now


[12/26/2023 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but some kind of desolate area that even Umbreath fears on the west is good


[12/26/2023 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
I was just thinking it could connect to the future part of my game that ends up dealing with far realm mindflayer stuff. But it doesn't have to


[12/26/2023 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
Shimmersong is canonically kind of a fortress, with the winter knights who protect the kingdom when the Lightbringer is sleeping so it makes sense for it to have dangers on three sides


[12/26/2023 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
and that is a while away - the insinguer stuff might happen first actually


[12/26/2023 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
we are likely to finish isingue before you get to mindflayers


[12/26/2023 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
unless the exact borders are important for your plot i'd also leave the darkwood and the upper istaros a bit undeveloped


[12/26/2023 2:16 PM] .deciusmus
exact borders don't matter -


[12/26/2023 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
look at the shimmersong note


[12/26/2023 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that the shimmersong / duskmire border would actually potentially be more interesting than the amberglow connection


[12/26/2023 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, just reading it


[12/26/2023 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
Although I think Umbraeth ultimately is motivated by a sense of betrayal and hatred from Ethlenn. So at some level he doesn't care about the west so much as he does the east. But that border does sound like an interesting place


[12/26/2023 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I would push shimmersong's eastern border a little east and north, so the Aurbez plateau is fully within Shimmersong, and Duskmire is really originally centered east of Masance and north of Andonne


[12/26/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
originally this was maybe, if not exactly empty land, not a strong realm, or perhaps was even gifted to Umbreath by Ethlynn, if the original split is more of an exile than a violent betrayal


[12/26/2023 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
Ethlynn feels to me a like a archfey with significant power


[12/26/2023 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[12/26/2023 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
I agree withthat


[12/26/2023 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so likely the bordering realms would be allies / vassals


[12/26/2023 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
her realm also borders Orenlas - or perhaps extends through Orenlas


[12/26/2023 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but also I think Ethylnn is more place-focused than many archfey


[12/26/2023 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
I actually like that a lot. He is originally exiled to his own realm, gifted by Ethlynn.


[12/26/2023 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
That works on a bunch of levels - the gift itself is a form of punishment, somewhat daring him to recreate her court for himself, which he can't do, so his inability to make even his own realm the kind of place he would want to live ends up its own kind of torment


[12/26/2023 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
Ethlenn could even the the original source of a deal, insisting that no one from her realm could go to his - which he thinks is a punishment for *her* but actually works out as a punishment to him beceause ultimately he loved the Twighlight Court, or whatever, which might be somewhat famous for its elegance and refinement, and upscale amusements


[12/26/2023 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
and he can't attract any talent because any fey that gives him alliegence can't go to the Twilight Court (which only happens every X years)


[12/26/2023 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the other question is what exactly Twlight's Grace is. I think that it is intentionally a small realm for ~reasons~


[12/26/2023 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but Ethlenn really is probably the "leader" in some vague fey sense of the whole western gulf


[12/26/2023 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
i.e., I don't think "realm 4" is more powerful than Ethlenn, that doesn't feel quite right


[12/26/2023 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
No, definitley not


[12/26/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't mean to imply that


[12/26/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
Just powerful enough that Umbraeth doesn't dare start something


[12/26/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
He definitley can't start anything with Ethlenn


[12/26/2023 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. he has no hope of conqueoring Twilight's Grace or really even harming it; he lives for small acts of venegance and revenge


[12/26/2023 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
For example, I imagine him trying to trick warlocks of Ethlenn to enter his realm, at which point they have violated the terms of the deal between him and Ethlenn by trepassing and lose her protection


[12/26/2023 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Or he tries to trick someone into believing that the terms of his deal with Ethlenn extend to the Materiel Plane. Other things like that. He has no particular hope of mounting any kind of attack on her --- but she is also bound by their agreement and can't enter his realm


[12/26/2023 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
Why does Ethlenn care about Tyrwingha? It seems like depending on the reason it would influence what she would be willing to give up to punish Umbreath


[12/26/2023 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. this is all great but also is very much a "both Ethlenn and Umbreath see mortal servants as pawns" vibe


[12/26/2023 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
which maybe is the right vibe


[12/26/2023 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm just not sure


[12/26/2023 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
So, the vibe I've been running for with Ethlenn is "beautiful wise faraway" - sort of Galadriel-equese


[12/26/2023 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
But definitely somewhat cavalier with mortals, in that she launched a bunch of PCs on various paths to try to ensure that they ended up in Cleenseau to stop an assassination attempt on Elaine


[12/26/2023 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
(and of course the PCs don't know this)


[12/26/2023 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
right, but that feels more like a divine protector


[12/26/2023 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
But also she *cares a lot* about the Tyrwinghan royal family


[12/26/2023 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
for reasons I'm not totally clear on


[12/26/2023 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
so to me that implies a different relationship with Umbreath. e.g., what if Umbreath tricks a prince of Tyrwingha into Duskmire


[12/26/2023 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, fine if fey feel weird and illogical


[12/26/2023 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
meaning, what would she do if that happened?


[12/26/2023 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
does she agree to deal that punishes mortals who enter duskmire?


[12/26/2023 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
would she even propose that deal if she sees the mortals of tyrwingha as under her protection?


[12/26/2023 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm


[12/26/2023 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
A couple of possiblities come to mind...


[12/26/2023 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
(a) it could have been a mistake at some level, a failure of foresight and changing human conditions. Perhaps when she made the deal she didn't anticipate the relationship between Sembara and Tyrwingha (unclear if Umbraeth was exiled pre or post Drankorian deal)

(b) it could have been somewhat involuntary - there is this material of the "realm 3" that Umbraeth conqueored/defeated/something else. Perhaps Ethlenn saw a deal like this as the best of a bad set of options


[12/26/2023 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
(c) it could not apply to mortals -


[12/26/2023 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
(c) might actually work the best. The deal doesn't apply to mortals at all, Umbraeth just likes to try to trick them


[12/26/2023 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
i kind of feel like Ethlenn's vibe is that she has protected Tyrwingha forever, basically


[12/26/2023 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
Yes


[12/26/2023 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
so rather than fight with Umbreath starting as a fey conflict, what if it starts as Umbreath playing small tricks on mortals that she doesn't approve of?


[12/26/2023 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
she kicks him out so he can't access Tyrwingha


[12/26/2023 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[12/26/2023 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe in the beginning she's not even really mad at him, exactly, just disappointed / annoyed


[12/26/2023 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
and this could also be the source of a lot of weird fey rumors in tyrinwingha


[12/26/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so, a long time ago you have Twilight's Grace, which is kind of the center of power of the western gulf, and Ethlenn with this idiosyncratic wish to protect tyrwingha. but also a lot of power and seeing the other neighboring realms as basically vassals


[12/26/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
one of her rules is that you cannot mess with the mortals of tyrwingha


[12/26/2023 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
Umbreath is high up in her court, maybe an important vassal, obviosly somewhat powerful


[12/26/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
but also chaotic in nature and can't resist the temptation to trick people sometimes


[12/26/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
Ethlenn finds out, and punishes him with exile


[12/26/2023 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps there is a deal of sorts, she will let him live but no fey can go to his court if they wish to join the Twilight Court, etc, as you discussed


[12/26/2023 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that works


[12/26/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
she is bound by the promise so as he has gotten more cruel and violent over the years she can't just invade his realm


[12/26/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
his realm probably starts quite small then, nestled between the Aurbez / Shimmersong, the Andonnne, the Darkwood, and the Enst


[12/26/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[12/26/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
although it could also work for it to have originally just been the darkwood


[12/26/2023 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
huh, thats a good idea


[12/26/2023 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
which perhap was "the darkwood" even as far back as the Drankorian empire


[12/26/2023 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that a lot actually


[12/26/2023 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, so he starts as Duskmire is just the darkwood


[12/26/2023 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
right, and then over time he is the one who whever there is an opportunity, grabs territory


[12/26/2023 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the exact details don't matter much


[12/26/2023 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
their is no reason to believe fey realms are particularly static


[12/26/2023 3:02 PM] rsulfuratus
although archfey rarely die they likely wax and wane in power


[12/26/2023 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Ethlenn has been a constant, of course, and Cloudspinner was for a while


[12/26/2023 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
Ethlenn can't go after him directly because she agreed to a deal not to harm him or something


[12/26/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, so his realm grows a bit here and there


[12/26/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
I guess there doesn't even need to be a realm that falls


[12/26/2023 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
It could work to just have the relationship between them get worse and worse as he always takes the opportunity to expand


[12/26/2023 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
And the really only "major" thing that happens is the fey realm in the southern sentinels is disrupted at the end of the Great War, to be replaced with some empty terrority, which he takes and some "scary thing to the west"


[12/26/2023 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I'd probably leave it a bit undetermined


[12/26/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
Amberglow in part is modeled after the Sandman's realm in the netflix series after he is imprisoned for a long time


[12/26/2023 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
Cloudspinner is/was powerful enough that Amberglow is not conquered, it is empty / decaying


[12/26/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but of course one can assume there were many smaller realms stretching between Amberglow and Twilight's Grace


[12/26/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
and with the fall of Amberglow, these are vunerable


[12/26/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
then, I do think there were serious disruptions around the time of the Great War


[12/26/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
Even Umbreath may not understand exactly what happened


[12/26/2023 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
But, the west is now scary/dangerous


[12/26/2023 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
And possibly Insigue mumble mumble something Beryl Rangers magic water mumble


[12/26/2023 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
Shimmersong is a hard stop on westward expansion by Umbreath but he might not really care, and might even ally with Lightdancer sometimes to defeat incursions from "scary west thing"


[12/26/2023 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
And, perhaps, Ethlenn never really cared much about the southwest - this was always somehow in the Cloudspinner's orbit - so she doesn't do anything after the fall of Amberglow


[12/26/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus

[12/26/2023 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
But as Umbreath becomes more and more a thorn in her side she does make sure that ~fey realm in Sembara~ is not vulnerable


[12/26/2023 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
So the above has Shimmersong expanded a bit and then #1 is the original duskmire


[12/26/2023 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
1+2 is the minimum size of Duskmire now for game reasons. Open quesiton is whether it includes 3 (and it could go a little farther west, basically, until it stopped by the "scary thing")


[12/26/2023 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
Then north of Duskmire I think there are at probably 2 different realms, but the details don't matter too much. I was thinking about a Highlands-kingdom-northern realm full of human sized beasts, where all the animals talk


[12/26/2023 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think this makes sense


[12/26/2023 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
the exact southern/western borders of Duskmire don't matter so much


[12/26/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
But then there is probably also some other realm or realms  in the western gulf/sembara/tollen area that is twilight's grace ally/part of Ethlenns domain


[12/26/2023 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
probably there is some buffer area around #3  but whether a full-fledged realm or just a kind of demilitarized zone could be unclear


[12/26/2023 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
my feeling is expanding west and south would be easy for Duskmire since Ethlenn perhaps doesn't acre


[12/26/2023 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
*care


[12/26/2023 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
and e.g. what is now March of Andonne might have been a vassal of Amberglow or something


[12/26/2023 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[12/26/2023 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
then Duskmire cannot expand further west because of the hard border with Shimmersong, but north open


[12/26/2023 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right, and the north is especially opened after the "whatever happened" during the fall of Cha'mutte


[12/26/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[12/26/2023 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
so that is presumably more recent


[12/26/2023 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
And so since the Great War Duskmire could have grown by 50% or something, pushing north


[12/26/2023 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
Which works perfectly, it makes Duskmire's overlap with Cleenseau recent, which is what I was after


[12/26/2023 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
What do you think of Twilight's Gate as the name for a militarized buffer realm


[12/26/2023 3:25 PM] rsulfuratus
sound a little too similar to Twilight's Grace for my taste


[12/26/2023 3:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but don't have strong feelings


[12/26/2023 3:25 PM] .deciusmus
Well, I was feeling like maybe a bit too similar


[12/26/2023 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
could just be the Sunset Gate


[12/26/2023 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
it is the line where the sun actually sets


[12/26/2023 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
I was envisioning an actual buffer realm, not just a line


[12/26/2023 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
But the whole realm could be called Sunset Gate


[12/26/2023 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
Right


[12/26/2023 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
Or, the buffer realm doesn’t need to be a realm really


[12/26/2023 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
The Sunset Gate is the line Umbreath cannot pass due to the terms of his exile


[12/26/2023 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Various minor fey allies (strong but not archfey) of ethlenn occupy the sunward side to keep watch


[12/26/2023 3:30 PM] rsulfuratus
But it isn’t really a realm - there is no archfey in control


[12/26/2023 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, here is where I think we've landed on Duskmire....

Originally, it was the fey realm concurrent with the Darkwood, which has always been "the Darkwood" even in Drankorian times, for undetermined reasons. This realm was given to Umbraeth by Ethlenn as part of his exile, which is at an undetermined date, but predates Cloudspinner's imprisonment.

Once Cloudspinner is exiled, the opportunity arises to expand to the west, which Umbraeth eagerly does, until he reaches the fortified borders of Shimmersong in the west and the <unnamed Ulrich fey> to the north.

Then, when the Great War disrupts <unnamed Ulrich fey> he expands north as far as the Wistel, where he encounters another strong archfey, the <big talking animals fey>, and west, until he encounters <scary thing in the ruins of Ulrich fey>


[12/26/2023 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
The Sunset Gate runs basically due north from the westeren edge of the Darkwood - through Fellburn and then northward, and is a literal line Umbraeth cannot cross


[12/26/2023 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
(where the sun sets)


[12/26/2023 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
The lands sunward of the Sunset Gate (in the region labeled 3)  are not part of any domain, but there are several courts and castles of allies of Ethlenn. But this area is also especially treacherous. Time works even more strangely than usual, and without an archfey to bring order to the land, the line of the Sunset Gate is particularly unsettled, so the border between 2 and 3 is a big vague, and thus the eastern border of Duskmire is a bit vague


[12/26/2023 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I like this


[12/26/2023 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
are you going to copy it all to Obsidian?


[12/26/2023 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[12/26/2023 3:40 PM] .deciusmus
Starting that now.


[12/26/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
on a totally separate topic, I'm thinking of putting the neo-easterner religion in Usk / northern Green Sea


[12/26/2023 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
possibly Irrla as well, tbd


[12/26/2023 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
Is Ursk the right place for an interesting religion on top of all the mage stuff?


[12/26/2023 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I guess we explicitly left out religion when doing the Artem backstory to make it easy to add in later whatever seemed right


[12/26/2023 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
And its a good place to introduce it in game.


[12/26/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so things will be more complicated than I'm letting on


[12/26/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but the basic idea is that it would be useful for the people of the northern Green Sea coast - east of Skaerhem all the way to the Eastern Isles - to be culturally distinct from western/southern green sea


[12/26/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
basically trying to figure out the cultural strands of the green sea


[12/26/2023 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
you have:
- "east northerners" that become the highland cultures of Sembara and Vostok


[12/26/2023 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
- "ancient mariners" that are Skaer


[12/26/2023 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
- "east southerners" that become Medju / mariner trade pensisula with undetermined religion but which has some cultural connections to each other and are outward-looking / trade oriented


[12/26/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
that leaves basically only Irrla and the north coast


[12/26/2023 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
(this is excluding drankorian-influenced areas in Cymea / South Cymea / Western Gulf; and Dunmari-influenced areas in South Cymea)


[12/26/2023 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
both irrla and north coast are relatively not seafaring


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
so probably should have a fairly significant cultural break with the Hkaran mariner culture


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
Did you look throughthe old emails from last summer about mariner trade peninsula?


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
I thought there was some good stuff there, and I think we were leaning towards the "divine spark" religion as north coast/Irrla


[12/26/2023 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[12/26/2023 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the ^^ is basically a summary of those discussions


[12/26/2023 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right.


[12/26/2023 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
I'd add that the above shouldn't imply that the eastern isles themselves (which are quite large) are not another cultural strain TBD


[12/26/2023 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right, eastern isles themselves are strange and unique and potentially dominated by non-humans anyway


[12/26/2023 3:51 PM] .deciusmus
I liked this idea for the MTP itself:
The overriding attitude of MTP religion though is one that says: love your gods for if you do, they will watch over you. And there is also a strong sense of: the more love you give, the more love you have to give. This very strongly encourages adopting lots of additional gods. I am imaging the most religious folks having rosary bead style chains of symbols of many different gods and ships decorated with totems to many different gods, the more the better.


[12/26/2023 3:52 PM] .deciusmus
which doesn't really impact putting divine spark up in Ursk/Irrla


[12/26/2023 3:52 PM] .deciusmus
(plus this
The divine spark religion doesn’t actually contribute gods to this mix, but it does contribute a meditative tradition that the MTP people see as a way to get closer to the gods, and so there is a unusual semi-Buddhist style self-awareness / meditation philosophy that floats around. This leads to some folks say chanting a sutra to twelve different gods to strengthen their connection to them.)


[12/26/2023 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, there is a lot of good stuff about MTP there but not my current focus, at least not until you do the cursed demon waters sidequest


[12/26/2023 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
the things that are currently not clear in my mind are:
- is Irrla culturally related to Ursk/north coast or is it a distinct thing? 
- how big of a cultural break is the Skaer / Vostok Mountains?
- how long has Ursk been settled? Is the isolation a relatively new thing or does this go back 1000 years?


[12/26/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, yes, I think that all makes sense especially the "northern" route - basically a big split between the Vos (east northerns), Skaer (ancient mariner), and Ursk/Irrla/NorthCoast, which themselves are quite distinct from the "east southerns" who end up being the basis of MTP/Medju


[12/26/2023 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
My instinct is that irrla is distinct


[12/26/2023 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is my instinct too


[12/26/2023 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
although that could theoretically still leave the possibility of Irrla as a part of the divine spark culture if there was an early split between Ursk/north coast and Irrla w/i the divine spark tradition. e.g. could have a indian/japanese buddhist kind of thing


[12/26/2023 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[12/26/2023 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
As far as Ursk, the old Artem backstory thread had a lot of good ideas


[12/26/2023 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it was pretty marginal land until the various Urskian magical rituals were developed


[12/26/2023 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Also the Artem backstory had the novja which we had theorized were a different cultural strain


[12/26/2023 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
oh yes, that is going to come back


[12/26/2023 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it works best if Ursk has grown a lot in the last 300-500 years, since the various magical rituals were established, but that without those rituals it is a pretty marginal land and never had large population


[12/26/2023 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps there are two strains of divine spark people on Irrla and scattered along the northern green sea coast, and for whatever reason the north green sea coast folk turn away from large-scale seafaring


[12/26/2023 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
and, if not exactly isolationist, have low population densities, no big cities, and weird dangerous crap like vampires and dragons to deal with, so they develop a low-key culture based around low population denisties


[12/26/2023 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
depending on your plans, this culture could become the novja, or the novja could be a more Vostok/northern group heading east


[12/26/2023 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
But I think Skaer is a big cultural break. I think the Ursk culture is not particularly similar to Skaer/Vostok at all


[12/26/2023 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, okay. still a few moving pieces I'm trying to decide what the most fun would be


[12/26/2023 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, the novja could be culturally related to Skaer


[12/26/2023 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
if the novja are a vostok / northern group, that potentially sets up a religious conflict with kestavo vs divine spark


[12/26/2023 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
or, you have a divine spark vs magocracy


[12/26/2023 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
conceptually I kind of feel like either could work but from pure worldbuilding logic it is probably more likely to have north coast settlers as divine spark and then magocracy grow out of that, rather than the novja be vos-related


[12/26/2023 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
kestavo vs divine spark seems like it would be an odd set to be in conflict


[12/26/2023 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess you could have these sense that the divine spark tradition is *usurping* the kestavo


[12/26/2023 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think it is more:
the Vostok mountains are a serious barrier to travel, so you have basically wilds on the other side, and you get the divine spark religion out of which a magocracy grows, setting up a cultural conflict between the "old magocracy" and the novja

vs

the various highlander cultures spread across the entire interior Taiga, and blend in various ways, producing the Sembaran highlands, the Vos, and the ancestors of the novja with some degree of cultural continunity; then, as the magocracy develops on the coast they conquer the inland


[12/26/2023 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
in the current day the vostok mountains and the interior (even the coast) east of Skaerhem is very inhospitable but that could be relatively recent


[12/26/2023 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
the Artem backstory kind of implied #2 but with the origin of the novja undetermined, that doesn't mean the implication has to be true


[12/26/2023 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it could swing either way, it just depends:
is the magocracy conquering a very distinct culture (vos/highlander) or a relatively related culture (novja/divine spark who lived inland instead of on the coast)


[12/26/2023 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
I like the novja being distinct, personally.


[12/26/2023 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don't have strong feelings


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
And small differences can loom large, ultimately, so the "you are half foreign" vibe of the novja could happen even if the cultural difference isn't huge to being with


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think the novja should feel different now


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
no matter what


[12/26/2023 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
question is just 500 years ago, how different were they?


[12/26/2023 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I kinda of  like the idea of this band of northern-small-gods people spreading almost from coast to coast across the taiga and northern forests of Taelgar


[12/26/2023 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
And then the mariners come into the picture but on the north coast, really hug the coast, with these small scattered coastal villages. For a thousand years they might not even know that there were people way to the north, especially if the rivers are cold, frozen some of the time, and hard to navigate


[12/26/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
So you end up with two low population density groups, a divine spark group who left the mariner traditions behind and live in small groups along the coast, and a (probably semi-nomadic) vos/kestavo/northern culture farther north in the forests


[12/26/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps there is a more urbanized divine spark group on Irrla, who develop in their own unique way


[12/26/2023 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
but that can be undetermined


[12/26/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
Then, the magocracy arises, say 500 years ago, and urbanizes and the population grows (a lot) amongst (some section?) of the divine spark people


[12/26/2023 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
and then post-Great War they conquer the northern people


[12/26/2023 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm. yeah, this could work. will ponder a bit


[12/26/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
But honestly, a single divine spark culture could work as well. Why does one group go north though?


[12/26/2023 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
The land seems marginal-ish and it isn't clear why you wouldn't end up with dense(r) coastal settlement


[12/26/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in that case, the idea would be that you have relatively uniform low-density settlement at first. development of rituals allows bigger cities to be protected, and you get something like an 'urban / rural' split


[12/26/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
for a while these cultures just develop in peace separate from each other


[12/26/2023 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
then something changes after the great war, prompting urban culture to expand


[12/26/2023 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
this could be whatever drives expansion in the northerner scenario as well


[12/26/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I can see how that work would, but I kinda like the small-gods-northern-band as a unifying factor across taelgar


[12/26/2023 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
But I want to organize my feywild notes and then go pack, so..

(go pack, not go back..)


[12/28/2023 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
Some names because I don’t like random unnamed stuff—
For the ruined fey kingdom:
Farsight, Clearpeak, Diamond’s Facet, Sharpspire

For the beast-heavy place to the north: 
Nature’s Sanctuary, Beasthome, Nature’s Den, Nature’s Awakening


[12/28/2023 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
Sunset Gate: a line stretching from somewhere in Amberglow to somewhere in northern Sembara. It’s a line of materialized color - yellows and reds and oranges painted in the sky, but as these physical barriers - like paint brush strokes just sitting in the air, almost. The colors are physical and passing through them is impossible, by they are riddled with cracks and openings. In some places, these cracks are sharp and dangerous, and passing through has weird time effects - sometimes it takes a day or a year to walk through a crack. In other places, especially near Twilight’s Grace, there are elaborate structures


[12/28/2023 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
Since Amberglow fell it’s been even odder and weirder and the time effects worse and less predictable. And sometimes dark clouds race along the colors, blotting them out and bringing especial danger as it’s hard to even tell where the edges are


[12/28/2023 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
Where it passes through Duskmire, near the Darkwood, Umbraeth has chiseled and chipped tried to tear it down, but it has grown back as a tangled maze of angry reds and oranges, like sharp glass. It’s especially difficult to pass and this has lead to the Darkwood, despite being the original heart of Umbraeths domain, now somewhat different


[12/29/2023 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
I’m moving on from feywild to the sembaran impacts of the “undead plague” that’s happening right now in 1720. I might tweak some borders and sizes of baronies, I assume you aren’t committed to anything specific here


[12/29/2023 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
Not committed to anything specific re: semabaran borders


[12/29/2023 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
I like the Sunset Gate a lot


[12/29/2023 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Sharpshire is good for the ruined fey kingdom


[12/29/2023 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
Not really hugely a fan of any of the beast names. Also, what were the imagined borders of this place? This is overlapping the bulk of Sembara?


[12/29/2023 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
I didn’t love those names either. As far as the place I imagine it more overlapping with highland kingdoms and eastern sembara. Western sembara is probably allies of Ethlenn or something


[12/29/2023 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
Oops, reverse that. Western sembara


[12/29/2023 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
So from west to east the fey realms in sembara are:
Far west - remains of Sharpspire north of that animal-place
Then Duskmire, again with the animalplace north of it.


[12/29/2023 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
Then the sunset gate - outside any particular realm - with undetermined realm north of that.
The.

Then twilights Grace


[12/29/2023 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
When I’m back at my computer I’ll send a map


[12/29/2023 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
But at a high level I’m envisioning a animal fey kingdom over the highlands, bordering Duskmire to the north, and something else over Embry / heartlands, north of sunset gate and the various “non-realm” ethlenn allies


[12/29/2023 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
is the animal place relevant to duskmire? or just an idea for something that could be north of duskmire and would prevent duskmire from expanding?


[12/29/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
Just an idea


[12/29/2023 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
I liked the idea of a fey place that is focused on talking animals and such


[12/29/2023 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
Basically what I was thinking was this:

where:
D = Duskmire
S = Sharpspire, now a dangerous mystery
Orange line = Sunset Gate
A = small allied fey to Ethlynn but not part of any realm
B = nature/beast place

Although the exact line between A and B is a bit random, and B is a bit undefined


[12/30/2023 11:10 PM] .deciusmus
Pushed lots of Sembara stuff - mostly names — if you are curious   Plus some feywild stuff


[12/31/2023 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
How hard is it to tweak the map? I don’t have a good way to do it but have a few modifications I’d like to make to Sembara, mostly adding some rivers and forests


[12/31/2023 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
not hard. coastlines are a bit of a pain but adding rivers and forests is easy


[12/31/2023 2:16 PM] .deciusmus
If you get a chance, adding Cleenseau Wood, which basically streches from immediately north of cleenseau to ~30 miles south of Ainwick, and then a couple small hills just east of the wood in the northern part of the Barony of Aveil would be great


[12/31/2023 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
can you sketch it out and send me a draft? I can add it to the map then

[1/2/2024 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
I assume you haven't gotten to this; I have a few more tweaks to Sembara


[1/2/2024 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Correct


[1/2/2024 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Might do it tonight so send whatever other tweaks you have

[1/2/2024 1:09 PM] .deciusmus
the 3 added grey boxes are new hills : extensions of Braebine and Aine Hills, plus the new Aveil Ridge


[1/2/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
The arrows show the direction the lines of hills run; Braebine and Aine are basically where the land starts to rise towards the highlands


[1/2/2024 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
The green areas are new forests, one just north of Cleenseau the other extending along the entire highand side of the Aine Hills


[1/2/2024 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
There are several new rivers in blue; the ones in Arnsbury and Tyrwingha are a bit arbitrary and could be whatever feels right on the map; the forked river in Aveil I've made up stuff for


[1/2/2024 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
The new river in "WM4" is to establish a bit of a border


[1/2/2024 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
Then, if you want to tweak the political units layer:

The section labeled #1 around Dunore is the new Barony of Usbourg
The section labeled #2 around Ainwick is the (now much smaller) Barony of Ainwick
The "highlands" region of Sembara proper grows to include everything north of Chemin/Ainwick/Usbourg (labeled 4, but hard to see)
The "WM4" (Marches of Bronva) is everything west of the new river in WM


[1/2/2024 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
Also TM1/TM2 are gone and just "Tyrwingha" and I'd be inclined to make Adderfell a bit smaller


[1/2/2024 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed new version of world map


[1/2/2024 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
generally for precise detail I'd suggest making a separate hexmap since it is difficult to represent things that are <30 miles or so on the world map


[1/2/2024 10:10 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense

I'm not sure that Amberglow would ever have extended as far north as Cleenseau


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
feywild geography is not a perfect match for material plane geography - but even so that would make amberglow very big


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't mean to imply it did


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] .deciusmus
where did you get that from?


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] .deciusmus
Vahavia's report?


[1/2/2024 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/2/2024 10:37 PM] .deciusmus
They would not have thought that this was Amberglow, just contrasting it to a more pleasant fey place


[1/2/2024 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
ah - in that case I would think he'd refer to Dreamhaven


[1/2/2024 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean it is kind of a meaningless detail


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but of course pre Great War the elves of Ainuymara would have relatively close contact with Dreamhaven


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I was thinking the elves of Rostare might have had a connect to Amberglow. Might just drop it though, my players have no idea what any of these realms mean


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
wait, I also confused myself


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
Vahaiya is not from Rostare - that was gone long before they were born


[1/2/2024 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
Ignore Rostare above, that not from the Vahaiya letter, it was in the drankor stuff


[1/2/2024 10:39 PM] rsulfuratus
you also have Marcel de Valarin dying in 1658, which is before the Vahaiya letter


[1/2/2024 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
oops


[1/2/2024 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
I should fix his death date


[1/2/2024 10:39 PM] .deciusmus
it isn't canonical, just tossed in


[1/2/2024 10:41 PM] rsulfuratus
in 'An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realms' I would change Rostare to Orenlas


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Rostare is really far away - like 2000 miles from Tyrwingha


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
whereas Orenlas is immediately next door and would be concerned with the fey in their neighborhood


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, for some reason I thought it was close to Drankor


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
but yeah, makes sense


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
it is close to drankor. drankor is 2000 miles from Tyrwingha


[1/2/2024 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
I guess Drankor is really far away


[1/2/2024 10:45 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I think what ultimately caused the rift between Ethlenn and Umbraeth was his tendency to trick humans into the Feywild either to be his servants, or even to be ensorcelled by other fey outside of Twiligt's Grace, or just for giggles to be left somewhere dangerous to die


[1/2/2024 10:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i like that


[1/2/2024 10:46 PM] .deciusmus
She probably tolerates some amount of fey-being-fey around humans, but violating the refuge she extended to Tyrwinghans to come to the Feywild is unforgiveable


[1/2/2024 10:47 PM] rsulfuratus
other than those comments I think the letters and books are fine. i removed the status/tim and pushed but didn't make other changes so assume you'll make small edits as discussed / clean up


[1/2/2024 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
yup


[1/2/2024 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
I rewrote the Amberglow line to just talk about stories of "realms"


[1/2/2024 10:47 PM] .deciusmus
unnamed


[1/2/2024 10:48 PM] rsulfuratus
oh, one other thing - I'm not actually sure how closely related demi-planes and fey / shadowfell domains are. i might remove the mention of demiplanes from the drankor book since it seems unnecessary game-wise to link them


[1/2/2024 10:50 PM] .deciusmus
In another my game topic, the lich's plan to destroy Sembara is coming into view.... 

Step 1: Cast a really powerful and hard to cast spell (took a year or two of prep) that caused a decent percent (1%?) of the dead in southern Sembara to rise up as zombies/skeletons/etc
Step 2: Absolutely and completely mismanage the response...


[1/2/2024 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
really minor point


[1/2/2024 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
The mismanagement involves things like imposing a wealth tax to raise an army, but doing so on halflings and lizardfolk as well as humans (which is not what sembaran law says)


[1/2/2024 10:51 PM] .deciusmus
Having some of his controlled barons (he only has a few) collect the tax twice


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
Mixing up the army and sending it various different places, so Fellburn stays under siege from a bunch of hobgoblin zombies through the winter,


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
Specifically trying to stir up the Duke of Wisford so he rebels


[1/2/2024 10:52 PM] .deciusmus
etc


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] .deciusmus
Whatever my PCs do, a group of adventures is going to kill the lich in 6 months (July 1720) and things will get fixed after that


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
why does the lich want to destroy Sembara again?


[1/2/2024 10:53 PM] rsulfuratus
or does it not matter for the campaign?


[1/2/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
It matters a lot for the 2nd part of the campaign, but not entirely sorted out. The short version is that he was a wizard with a desire for life extension, doing dubious research, the House of Sewick specifically destroyed his research/tried him for illegal magic, he escaped, vowed revenge on the House of Sewick


[1/2/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
So actually it is less about destroying Sembara than the House of Sewick specifically. Probably he is hoping one of the northern dukes will eventually organize a coup of some kind


[1/2/2024 10:56 PM] .deciusmus
I have a vague backstory but I need to work it out a little bit more, at the moment it is still a bit unclear, other than a personal vendetta against the House of Sewick for what he sees as ruining his life


[1/2/2024 11:01 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed one more book - contains a bunch of stories about fey - less impact on other parts of the world or things you made up, but I did leave it status/tim


[1/2/2024 11:01 PM] .deciusmus
going to bed now


[1/3/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
writing notes on Delwath's dream conversation with Sura. what are you specifically trying to learn here? Sura is mostly going to want to talk about surviving the experience of losing a chunk of your life, having never expected to find someone else who survived a similar experience, but for someone with Delwath's persuasion and charisma it would presumably be pretty easy to steer the conversation to whatever you want to learn


[1/3/2024 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
Delwath would be happy to be a dream therapist for Sura (or more accurately, to start a part-of-your-life-disappeared support group via Dream), and would honestly probably get sucked into that kind of conversation pretty easily


[1/3/2024 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
For "stuff to learn" mostly just "how is the negotiations of Karnas going" / "what's the state of the conflict"


[1/3/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
FYI I think Delwath will keep up the dream-based lost-time-survivors-support-group over our downtime. Not every night but once a week or once every 10 days or so,  influenced by Sura's interest as well obviously


[1/3/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
I'll ask the gods at some point if they know of anyone nearby who has lost time in extra-dimensional spaces other than the Feywild (hint hint for the Deno'qai who would be in the same boat, right?)


[1/3/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, the tanshi say, there is some relatively close in the same boat


[1/3/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have an "official" layer for Sembaran borders? Is there any reason for me to not just draw stuff myself for now?


[1/3/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't have an up-to-date borders layer in the official map, no


[1/3/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
no reason not to draw it yourself. it is tough to label lots of things in the big map otherwise everything is just covered in text


[1/3/2024 6:39 PM] .deciusmus
what font did you use for your labels


[1/3/2024 6:40 PM] rsulfuratus
JSL Ancient

kind of shocked that web page from ~2000 is still up


[1/4/2024 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
I've been mucking about with Sembara in more detail, as I try to work out the impacts of this mass of undead. Not really changing much from the big Sembara document, but a few things I wanted to at least vaguely run by you...

The basic idea of the new map is that 
(a) there is a core unit of the six ancient duchies and a few border baronies (Aveil + Ainwick) which is the historic ancient Sembara
(b) this is all the lowlands ... as the land rises north and west of several different lines of hills, you get into a loosely defined border with the highland kingdoms. There are lots (at least a dozen, perhaps two dozen) baronies here, and there is no "formal border" but really a loose line of loyalties. This "highland Sembara" stretches all the way from the Volta to the Wistel..
(c) Then there are the southern borderlands (south of the Enst) and the western borderlands (west of Ainwick/Cleenseau). These are all lands that have had significant post-Great War distruption. The western borderlands were largely depopulated in the aftermath of the Great War, as the destruction of Urlich Pass changed the entire economic rationale, and refugees fled west. A small number of military towns (i.e. Dunmore from the original one-shot) remained, but the land would have been really sparsely populated in the 1580s.
The lands south of the Enst were ruled by hogoblins for 50 years in the early 1600s


[1/4/2024 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
So basically, all of the infrastructure west of Aveil/Ainwick and south of the Enst was rebuilt/reestablished during the long peaceful reign of Cece I, which I imagine was also a baby boom time. Settlers were flowing west and south to populate these new lands, etc


[1/4/2024 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
The far western baronies (Dunfry/Usbourg/Enford/Bronva) were explicitly establised by Cece as military districts, although by 1748 the direct military relationship has probably faded, especially in Dunfry and Usbourg


[1/4/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
The southern baronies (I have 5 but might expand to 6 or 7) were all new grants, also by Cece, largely to loyalists from the wars. That section (between the Enst and Adderfell) is probably decent farmland, it was just ravaged by hobgoblins and war. So it is probably somewhat booming these days, lots of growth


[1/4/2024 8:54 PM] .deciusmus
historically, Maseau and Adderfell were never part of "historic" Sembara. Maseau was established by Derik I after his defeat of Atavas, as basically new land,


[1/4/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
Adderfell I think has always had close ties with Tyrwingha, and is probably only not part of Tyrwingha because the Tyrwinghan borders are set by Ethlenn for mysterious reasons and she doesn't want it -- although it is likely somewhat congruent with her kingdom.


[1/4/2024 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
For a long time the earls of Adderfell probably looked to Tyrwingha for direction, and they only gradually came into the Sembaran orbit after Derik became king of Tyrwingha. But probably in some formal sense, it has never been "ruled" by Sembara in the sense that its always been an allied state, not a specific and direct place ruled by the monarch, so to speak


[1/4/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this all basically works. one thing to think about is who exactly are the people living in these places? I've been reading the Great Sea again (the Mediterranean book I started in Nantucket, but I got bored after the fall of Rome and put it aside for a while until recently), and one thing that is really clear from this, which is probably obvious but perhaps isn't incorporated enough into Taelgar worldbuilding, is that you have these big empires that expand and contract across the Mediterranean over 600 years, but for the most part, the people don't move around (with some exceptions like medieval spain and some trade colonies)


[1/4/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
so I guess I would think a bit about what the cultures are here


[1/4/2024 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
Well, that's part of why I want the Great War to have been so depopulating


[1/4/2024 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, you have refugee movements and resettlement too


[1/4/2024 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
I think basically there are two ancient cultures here -- the highland culture and the lowland culture, which spread up the river valleys


[1/4/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
Within the lowland culture (which is the core of Sembara today) you have a Tyrwinghan variant, which isn't hugely different, but has some unique strains via the fey connection


[1/4/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
Maseau is always been a bit of a marginal borderland.


[1/4/2024 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I would think Maseau would have been fairly rich Drankorian province, if only by nearby association with Isingue


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm, maybe


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but probably no need to go back that far, really


[1/4/2024 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like the land is less fertile.


[1/4/2024 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
The southern part of Maseau, probably. The northern section south of the Enst is kinda marginal farmland, compared to more eastern Sembara


[1/4/2024 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
But also, ignoring that far back


[1/4/2024 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
Start with Atavas, say


[1/4/2024 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
The whole area between Insingue and Sembara is under hobgoblin rule for some time. They probably don't kill everyone, but you would imagine that as being pretty disruptive


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, and at that point for a while it probably feels like Sembara is pretty cut off


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
insignue is still connected to Dunmar-Chardon trade routes and the Green Sea via Orenlas / Cymea / "South Cymea"


[1/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[1/4/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
And I suspect a lot of refugee flows *south* during the Atavas wars


[1/4/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that would make sense - this is also the height of Dunmar's military power


[1/4/2024 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right, so that seems like a safer bet. But Derik is the one who actually defeats Atavas, and has an upper hand at reestablishing the human kingdoms in the region


[1/4/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
Isingue is closer to Kharsan than Tokra to Kharsan, for example


[1/4/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
So he finds someone suitable, makes them a Duke and gets them to pledge feudal loyalty to him, and so a somewhat depopulated Maseau - which its own more Insinguen culture somewhat distinct from Sembara gets incorporated into the kingdom


[1/4/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
So at the eve of the Great War you have basically 5 cultures in Sembara:

* The highland culture
* The lowland culture, which spreads all the way to the mountains along the Enst
* The Tyringhan vairnt of the lowland culture, also in Adderfell
* The Maseau culture, kinda weakened/depopulated
* The northern/Tollen-influenced culture which is another variant of Sembaran, but basically not too different, along the Volta


[1/4/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right I was just typing exactly same thing but slower


[1/4/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
politically, the lowland culture is very dominant at this point, as well


[1/4/2024 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of fell like Tyrwingha is a bit more diverged than this makes it seem, though. by the time of the Great War, the Tyrwinghans have been living under the protection of the fey for ~1000 years


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i would think that would not be a minor influence


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but part of Drankor


[1/4/2024 9:23 PM] .deciusmus
But yeah, actually, I have been playing in my game Tyrwingha has more different than "a variant"


[1/4/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
My player with a Tyrinwghan PC has a tendency to play her character as "somewhat foreign, why do these Sembarans do things weird" which I have not discourged


[1/4/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
but I think it works with the above, i.e. Tyrwingha probably feels pretty different. The unification of the two realms has always been a personal union of crowns, not some kind of real "single country"


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so then you have Great War, west is upended, plaguelands, all that


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right. And then in the early 1600s everything south of the Enst is ruled by hobgoblins for 50 years


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
almost


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
40-something


[1/4/2024 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
at this point everyone who survives is basically just pledging themselves to Derik III in desperation


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
Right, although Sembara also is abandoning people left and right


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
after Derik III dies though


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/4/2024 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so at that point I think there is room for a bit more complex set of loyalities and obligations that doesn't result in Sembara just being one big country in a modern sense


[1/4/2024 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
you already have personal union of crowns that joins Sembara and Tyrwingha


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but for example adderfell can have relatively shifting loyalities


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah - although I think Adderfell has been more of a Tyrwinghan than Sembaran allied state


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
historically


[1/4/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
then of course this motivates Cece I to install loyalists in the newly created duchies / marches


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think a lot of places perhaps have more of a feel of "the Barony of Aveil" than "Sembara", wouldn't they?


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
Well, I think that changed during Cece's reign


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
it was 60-ish years of peace and prosperity


[1/4/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
everyone loved her


[1/4/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
Well, let me think it through


[1/4/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean my sense historically is that it often was not very important to the people of random place X whether their lord owed alliegance to the king of france or the king of england, except insomuch as it meant they might be killed fighting in a war


[1/4/2024 9:33 PM] .deciusmus
It seems like at the beginning of Cece's reign, you have:

* Maseau, which has been separated from Sembara by a hobgoblin kingdom for 50 years and also has had its own influx of refugees and challenges on its southern border
* Adderfell, which is also separated from Sembara by hobgoblins, and probably heavily dependent on the Tyrwinghan knights for aid which stuff gets bad
* Tyrwingha, which has only been recently rejoined with the Sembaran crown and which has a pretty distinct culture at this point


[1/4/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
* The highlands, which really are a place of shifting loyalties, where the "border" is kinda meaningless, and some local lord might be loyal to the monarch of Ardlas rather than Sembara, and which might feel very much like the "barony of whatever" rather than sembara or ardlas specifically


[1/4/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
* The core ancient duchies, which I think includes Aveil and Ainwick (although they were historically the border baronies and loyal to the Duke of Wisford)


[1/4/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
* The western military baronies, still very much army camps and frontier, not so many people


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the bigger worldbuilding question is: given all the danger out there, and magic, and the gods, do humans actually regularly fight wars of conquest?


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
No, I think probably not


[1/4/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think I agree


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, sometimes things happen - i.e. Chardon + Dunmar. But you don't have stuff like the Norman Conquest of England that often


[1/4/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm thinking about the approximately 1000 wars fought over siciliy, for example


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
you could imagine a scenario where northern cymea is constantly changing hands to control the straights


[1/4/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
or the long term war between the english and french kings over france


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the question then is, the absence of wars of conquest, what changes alliegance? i think generally there would be a very strong incentive to be allied with someone bigger


[1/4/2024 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is a feeling of safety


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example most of the Drankorian conquest of Sembara isn't really a war. it is "we have a huge army and a million wizards" and the sembarans going "awesome come stay"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Sure


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Although there are exceptions, i.e. the highlanders


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right, obviously


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it *all* has to be "no war conquest"


[1/4/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
no, of course not, but a lot less than in the real world


[1/4/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, agreed


[1/4/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
but I actually think that means you tend to have a bit more local identity, e.g. Barony of Aveil is not not-Sembaran, exactly - the people who live there are largely Sembaran in culture


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
and while through long ties of alliance and culture, Aveil is always looking to Sembara first, Sembara probably wouldn't march knights on them if the next Baron refused to swear alliegance to the king


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
they might, of course


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but it would be far from a guarantee


[1/4/2024 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think that is true


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
on the other hand, if an upstart knight in Cleenseau declares himself king of the river lands, the Baron of Aveil almost certainly is marching knights against him, I would think


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
Although I think its a bit more complicated than that


[1/4/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the " long ties of alliance and culture" elides a lot, yes


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but, it would be a reason why the lich would imagine this plan could work


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think the Baron of Aveil is a bad example only because I have in my mind that it has ancient ties to the Duchy of Wisford


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
The big duchies are a better example


[1/4/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
But yes, I agree


[1/4/2024 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
I think at some level, the lich is trying to get the six duchies to each one declare indepedence from Sembara and destroy the sembaran crown that way


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
The first step is to get Wisford, which I think is one of the most powerful duchies, to suceed


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] rsulfuratus
I think an interesting historical model is actually in a way the early modern Spanish crown


[1/4/2024 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right with land and stuff all over the place?


[1/4/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
no I was thinking you have castile, aragon, etc


[1/4/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
they are unified and all owe allegiance to the same king but also you have powerful local power bases


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
right before the hapsburgs


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
like 1500s


[1/4/2024 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus

Composite monarchy
A composite monarchy (or composite state) is a historical category, introduced by H. G. Koenigsberger in 1975 and popularised by Sir John H. Elliott, that describes early modern states consisting of several countries under one ruler, sometimes designated as a personal union, who governs his territories as if they were separate kingdoms, in accor...


[1/4/2024 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right although I dont actually want to make up 6 different sets of taxes and laws and such 🙂


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right I wouldn't go to that extreme


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
you just need vibes


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] rsulfuratus
basically the point is the Duke of Wisford is an important person with independent power


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/4/2024 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
And in fact, in a weird position right now, because their historic influence over the southern Enst border has waned significantly


[1/4/2024 9:55 PM] .deciusmus
Because after Wisford bore the brunt of the Shattered Ice Clan attacks, and then Cece's resettlement was focused on crown loyalists


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
And actually I have it in my plan that the baron of Aveil is actually working for the lich or controlled by the lich or something


[1/4/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
Which works really well to isolate Wisford


[1/4/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
And then, on top of that:
* Wisford has close ties to the lizardfolk of Ozabal Swamp
* Fellburn was a center of a lot of battles, so there are a lot of dead. It is going to suffer a lot more form the raise 0.5% of dead than many places


[1/4/2024 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, I agree with all of that


[1/4/2024 9:58 PM] .deciusmus
The other point I was going for in my thinking above is that the southern and western baronies are basically "new" from Cece's reign


[1/4/2024 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
And the southern borderlands in particular have grown a lot - good farmland then, and a sense of economic possibilities..


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think those baronies would have largely (entirely?) been personal possessions of the crown


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
whether that is still true in 1750 can be an open question


[1/4/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, after reconquest, for sure


[1/4/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
But I think Cece gifted a lot of of them out


[1/4/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
And probably in the chaos after the lich dies Wisford gets back some level of control


[1/4/2024 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
especially because the next queen is Elaine II who is strongly Tyrwinghan


[1/4/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
and so I think in 1750, its more balanced -- the crown has more wealth and resources partly from an expanded royal demense in the south, but also at least some of the barons are currently back in the Wisford orbit


[1/4/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure it matters much, its all a peaceful land these days. The action is in Adderfell / March of Andonne / Aurbez


[1/4/2024 10:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I was thinking Maseau might have gained at the expense of Wisford


[1/4/2024 10:05 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that is possible as well


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway doesn't really matter for now


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
Oh, one last thought -- I'm trying to figure out when the western wall was built


[1/4/2024 10:06 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking maybe recently -- during Cece's reign, by dwarves, with some magical assistance from Tollen


[1/4/2024 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that works. I am pretty sure I explicitly imagined the wall was *not* there for the stone titan one shot


[1/4/2024 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and then it wouldn't have really made sense as a place to build a wall during the hobgoblin occupation


[1/4/2024 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so I would probably put it ~1660-1670


[1/4/2024 10:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also make it more magical


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
it is not just with the help of dwarves, it is with the help of stone giants


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
or something like that


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] rsulfuratus
or earth elementals


[1/4/2024 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
right, I like elementals more than stone giants. But yeah, good point


[1/4/2024 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
it might not really matter exactly. maybe there are lots of rumors


[1/4/2024 10:16 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe cece found a ring of three wishes and wished for a wall


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
ooh, I like that


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
maybe Cece stole a ring of three wishs from the lich


[1/4/2024 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
before he was a lich


[1/4/2024 10:18 PM] rsulfuratus
only potential flavor issue there is a ring of three wishes is about as arcane magic as arcane magic gets


[1/4/2024 10:18 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, true


[1/4/2024 10:19 PM] .deciusmus
although maybe it was Cece's secret


[1/5/2024 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed a image that I might use as a emblem for Avatus:

assets/avatus-symbol-sketch.png


[1/5/2024 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
Any concerns? This is coming up in my game via some undead warriors ressurected from battlefields of the Atavus wars


[1/5/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
looks fine to me


[1/5/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
Working more on my Dunmar page. Trying to model a bit on Wikipedia with say a short section on “politics” and then a link to a longer page as needed as I feel like it is kind of a lot to have 1000 words on Dunmari politics if you just want a quick overview


[1/5/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
“Expanded” notes for geography, religion, and history have obvious homes


[1/5/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
But eg politics, culture, economy and trade, justice/law don’t right now


[1/5/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking about the same issues for Sembara, i.e. tax law is going to be relevant in the session after next, I was going to try to pull togeher some notes but was't sure where to put it


[1/5/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
For now I’m thinking about just leaving in gazetteer


[1/5/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to suggest the same


[1/5/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, going back to the Highland Kingdoms name, I was going to make a obsidian change for a new tenative name...

Do you prefer 

Zimka (people)/Zimkovia (place) 
Pemvos (people)/Pemvora (place)


[1/5/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
Not necessarily final, but I want to start using something oher than highlands in other stuff about sembara region


[1/5/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
Although I like Zimka / Zimkovia (or Zimkova), Zovcka is probably too similar, so would probably need to change


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, Zovcka is the place that sees itself as "the true home" of the Zimka people


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
hence the similarity of name


[1/5/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, maybe a little too confusing in actual game but I think it works from a worldbuilding perspective


[1/5/2024 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
eh I'm not really sold, I think the names are kind of in an uncanny valley where they are close enough that you confuse them but not so close as to be obviously from the same root


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure why you couldn't just change the name of Zovcka, as far as I know it has never come up in any game


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
yeah you might be right


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, changing Zovcka is no problem


[1/5/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
The term "highlander" has come up a few times in my game but I don't have any issue just changing it, it is just background color. And none of the kingdom names matter


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
honestly I'm not even sure Zovcka is a kingdom


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
highlander is just what the sembarans call the Zimka


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
But it came up because one of the players speaks Zimka, but again, no issue just telling him I renamed the languag


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly I might just erase Zovcka for now


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
why does there have to be a specific name for the Zimka people north of Breva that were never controlled by Sembara?


[1/5/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
(rhetorical question)


[1/5/2024 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
Actually the more I think about that I like it because naming it as a "kingdom" kinda guides the mind in a certain direction, and I'm not sure the Zimka really have the same concept of kingship as the sembaras


[1/5/2024 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
I’m working a bit on land tenure in Sembara, and based on our previous conversation, rethinking a bit about how it grew outside the original six duchies.


[1/5/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
The original timeline I wrote imagined a series of conquests but that doesn’t really feel right


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
Who was living in these places after the fall of Drankor? I’m not really sure.


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
That said the Great War depopulated a lot of it so maybe it doesn’t matter


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think I'd bother to write much of that old history


[1/5/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that was the conclusion I was coming to


[1/5/2024 1:35 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing that is obvious after revisiting my old dunmar notes is that while I had some good bones of things, there is a lot in the old google docs that turned out to be wrong after playing a game in dunmar for 3 years, and it is a lot easier now to write up a good dunmar page. 

so I'm kind of inclined to be a little careful over-inventing stuff - or at least committing to stuff as canon - too early


[1/5/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a complete draft of my rewritten Dunmar note, curious if you have any feedback, especially on organization


[1/5/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
subnotes are not generally done, or are just notes


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I'm looking at dunmar


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a note on land holding in sembara that I'd appreciate thoughts on


[1/5/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
largely based on medieval england and the complexity of French/Normal law vs Anglo-Saxon law


[1/5/2024 3:27 PM] .deciusmus
I like the organization a lot


[1/5/2024 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
on sembaran land ownership - I think the vibe feels right in general. specific comments mostly on non-humans


[1/5/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
One comment on Dunmar, btw: what are the borders, exactly? Is there some set of land that is considered "dunmar" by the gods?


[1/5/2024 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
my feeling is probably not


[1/5/2024 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
the "the gods own the land" is more of a cultural/religious aspect of dunmari culture than the gods actually owning the land


[1/5/2024 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
although i do have a bunch of old, dubiously canonical notes about the gods specifically bringing the dunmari to this place for a particular purpose


[1/5/2024 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
or perhaps it goes the other way, the longer the dunmari occupy a place, the more the gods grow to inhabit it


[1/5/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
I like the vibe of the dunmari being more a people than a place, per se.


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
That is, Dunmar doesn't really have formal borders or political organization, it is the membership in a temple and the relationship of the temple to the Samraat that matters, not where you live


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that is definitely true


[1/5/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
So I think the political organization in the note could clarify that a bit more


[1/5/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I also kind of like the idea that the reason it is Shakun - after all, a rather minor diety - is responsible for the defense of the eastern border from all kinds of bad things is specifically because unlike the five siblings, she was born to a Dunmari and had a physical connection to the land


[1/5/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway on land holdings:


[1/5/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
1. dwarves I think would certainly own land, but probably never not outright (and even taxes might be complicated). dwarves would very likely outlive the lord of the manor, and there could theoretically be dwarven communities that have passed down land for longer than Sembara has existed


[1/5/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure exactly how this would play out and it probably isn't formalized in the way that relationships with lizardfolk and halflings are


[1/5/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but it doesn't seem very dwarvish for a dwarf to consider themselves a "peasant"


[1/5/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think maybe that's just a poor choice of words in my doc


[1/5/2024 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think freehold land is particularly "subserviant"


[1/5/2024 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
well yes, even putting aside the subserviant aspect


[1/5/2024 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno, if the dwarf buys Sembaran land, why would they be against paying taxes onit?


[1/5/2024 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
Or why wouldn't a dwarven smith by willing to lease some land from a lord, or whoever, because they didn't intended to stay for more than 30-50 years, so a 50 year lease seemed better than outright buying the land?


[1/5/2024 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think they would be against paying taxes on it - or even, necessarily, leasing it. i'm thinking about the opposite arrangement though, where the dwarves are already there and perhaps have been there for a while, and the land is now claimed as crownland or whatever


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
RIght, in those cases I just think the land would have never been claimed as crownland


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
Its folkland


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, sure, okay, that makes sense


[1/5/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
I actually envision the legal arrangements in some places as being quite complex


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so you might have little bits of folkland on a manorial estate that was in some dwarven family since before barony of X even exists


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, exactly


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Now, the dwarves might sell it, in which case it becomes crownland


[1/5/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
You can't really sell folkland outside of your "folk"


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
so in this case, to non-dwarves


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/5/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
By the dwarves could sublease it, or whatever


[1/5/2024 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, I think that works. dwarves are basically fine with debts and obligations and would generalyl fit in the system, although I think could be a lot of odd quirks (e.g. a dwarf might offer a very large sum instead of annual taxes in order to turn a piece of crownland back into folkland, for some  reason)


[1/5/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, that's basically the same idea as the lizardfolk. You are negoiating with the duke or king or queen


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the only think I would change about lizardfolk is that there is probably room for a range of attitudes here


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
all lizardfolk consider their land folkland


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but some lizardfolk might consider much of lowland sembara as "lizardfolk land"


[1/5/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
since historically (long ago) it was


[1/5/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
so there may be times when lizardfolk just settle without asking for permission and dare the local lord to do something about it


[1/5/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
this doesn't have to be common but I don't think relationships between sembarans and lizardfolk need to be 100% peaceful all the time


[1/5/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
true. I'm just not sure I want to set up Sembara in the role of colonizer taking the indigenous land


[1/5/2024 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
fair, although it is pretty different since the humans were there long ago too, and the lizardfolk weren't driven out by the humans


[1/5/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Right, just if it comes up in an actual game I'd want it to be more differentiated and less coded as "hey this was our land, we are taking it back"


[1/5/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I wouldn't play it as that. I don't think the lizardfolk would view sembaran settlements as occupying stolen land - it is more a question of rents on profits


[1/5/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
and whether it is formally sensible to lay claim to unsettled, unimproved land


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps (some) lizardfolk understand unimproved, unsettled land as simply empty and free to be claimed by anyone willing to work it


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
the sembarans who settled and built cities are doing exactly what they should - settle and grow and the land is yours


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
it is only the idea of a lord saying "this land is mine by right of whatever" *without* settling it or working it


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
Right, in fact, the ancient idea of folkland matches that exactly and could even have come (at least in part) from the lizardfolk


[1/5/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
of course going back to earlier conversations about lizardfolk they might have very different ideas of what improving land means


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think the vibe is still right regardless of details - the basic idea is the land supports you and you support it, and that is what gives you property rights


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
not the fact that you marched an army through two years ago


[1/5/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
(Some) lizardfolk then just reject all the "overlord/sovereign" stuff


[1/5/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps other lizardfolk see the building walls and maintaining borders as "improving" the land in a way that gives the crown control


[1/5/2024 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
It could just play almost as a disagreement about scope. Is maintaining a road through a wilderness an improvement to all of that empty land?


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[1/5/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
and I think it is more interesting if there are a range of opinions and disagreements among the lizardfolk

[1/5/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
now, halflings are more complicated


[1/5/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
Ultimately almost all of the "new" crownland outside of the ancient duchies either came about via 
* a slow process of accretion as (human) families died out, or sold land, and various tracts and bits and pieces came under the control of the crown
* major depopulation events were reversed by armies, and the crown claimed all the land they freed from the hobgoblins/whatever


[1/5/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I really don't think halflings would give a hoot about some human lord. if a halfling family wants to settle down and run an inn on the road between fellburn and rinburg, they aren't going to negotiate with some lord


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
they are going to build an inn, and run it. or negotiate with someone who owns an inn, and take it over


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
the whole concept that someone can "own" land feels very un-halfling


[1/5/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that said, they probably feel fine about paying taxes


[1/5/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
but also probably have their own opinions about what taxes are fair


[1/5/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Do you envision halflings as just kinda like ignoring local law?


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, almost completely


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Presumably they aren't going to just decide this piece of farmland looks nice so I'm just going to take it over


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
It seems hard to be a member of society in a fixed location and ignore the laws


[1/5/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
well, they have their own laws


[1/5/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example you can't just take stuff would be enforced at the halfling end of things not the human end of things, so to speak


[1/5/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Why would humans put up with that though?


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
I guess if it works and doesn't really cause problems


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
well usually halflings are pretty well behaved, and they are quick to punish their own troublemakers


[1/5/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
But why would the human lords of the land tolerate a halfling effectively just stealing their land?


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I don't really imagine halflings wanted to build a home in the middle of nowhere


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
people tolerate it because it doesn't always end up as "stealing"


[1/5/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
If you are building an inn just outside the walls of Rinburg, what, they just do it even though someone owns that land?


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that is the "you can't just take land"


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I'd imagine it like this. say a halfling family wants to start an inn outside Rinburg


[1/5/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a nice orchard near the river, just along the road, that seems perfect.


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
the set up camp in the orchard, and let it be known that they want to stay


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
and then they wait


[1/5/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
probably they don't build anything for a year, but they have a little market


[1/5/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
presumably at some point -- relatively soon, unless it is owned by an absentee landlord or something -- whoever owns the orchard (if they aren't the person working it every day) shows up


[1/5/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the halflings ask if they can build an inn, and what the person wants


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
if they can't come to an agreement, they move on. maybe they come back in a generation and see if the new owners are more amenable


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but most people agree pretty quickly, because the halflings remember strange things. you don't want your kids cursing you out for refusing a good offer


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
and sometimes what the halflings offer is way more than what the land is worth


[1/5/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but isn't that in fact "negoitating with some lord"?


[1/5/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess I was more thinking about chains of obligations


[1/5/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
But land really doesn't have a chain of obligations


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
well, you owe tax to someone


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, but most taxes are only on argicultural produce


[1/5/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
An inn doesn't owe property tax


[1/5/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
and halflings, for example, might not always agree on who owns land. if you are a peasant who has a 50 year lease, the halfings might decide you own the land, not the lord


[1/5/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but it gets dicey for the person with the 50 year lease


[1/5/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
sure. although there are probably plenty of stories (true or false) of halflings who gave some peasant a comparatively huge some of money for land they didn't technically own, and then the peasant just skipped town


[1/5/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and left the halflings to deal with the lord


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right, and the retribution would fall on the peasant not the haflings ,ultimately, because the lord doesn't want to piss off the halflings


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
that is why they skip town


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
But sometimes they are caught anyway


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
of course. basically the idea is the haflings don't really interact with the formal system of land registeries and deeds


[1/5/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
And othertimes the halflings are forced to leave, although that probably doesn't end well for the lord


[1/5/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don't have a good sense of halflings view of collective punishment


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point schwartz and discussed this and were leaning towards the idea that halflings have a very strong sense of familial justice - so if your great great grandparent cheated their great great grandparent you are in trouble


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
Right I more meant if a lord pushes the halflings out, do they punish everyone who lives in the manor?


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
Or just the lords family


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
no, just the lords family


[1/5/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
But they might not always have a good mechanism to do that


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
right, which is why sometimes the halflings get pushed out


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
Also, it doesn't strike me as obvious that the halfling would decide that the yearly lease-fee is meaningless, i.e. would they actually want to ruin some small scale landholder?


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
I guess maybe sometimes they do


[1/5/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
and other times they don't


[1/5/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
halflings are supposed to feel kind of chaotic


[1/5/2024 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
sometimes they. might double the yearly lease fee the previous owner was paying for no clear reason apparent to the landholder


[1/5/2024 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
What is a halfling view on contracts?


[1/5/2024 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I think their view is roughly something like my present self cannot compel an obligation from my future self to your future self\


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
of course this can't be taken to the extreme or you couldn't even buy something from them


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think generally most people would be wary of long term contracts with halflings


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. you'd never make a 50 year lease with a halfling imagining it would be kept


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
you'd make a series of 1 year leases


[1/5/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
But I think from the perspective of Sembaran land holding, it boils down to 
(a) a halfling would consider the land theirs as long as they had purchased it fairly and they were still using it
(b) halflings don't always agree with the Sembaran legal system as to who the owner is or what theterms of purchase "should be"


[1/5/2024 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
right, and if they acquire a freehold, and would normally owe a manorial tax, they might also not agree with the lord on what the manorial tax should be - they would view this as a negotiation where the amount owed might include 0, instead of something the lord gets to decide


[1/5/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
Well...


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't refactored the taxes part, but I think for the most part the manorial taxes are a percetage of the harvest


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
If you build an inn, nothing is due


[1/5/2024 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but then doesn't the growth of a city just cost money? unless the lord is getting it back in other taxes


[1/5/2024 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
I have a separate taxes document that basically has 3 main taxes:

the deca and nonem, which are 1/10 and 1/9 of the harvest (so collectively, 19% of the harvest), due on argicultural produce
the hearth tax, due from every building with a hearth


[1/5/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, sure, then halflings might pay the hearth tax but consider it a negiotiation to set a fair rate


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Then, additionally, there is a baronial tax, owed by the baron to the crown or duke, for which the baron has to collect money


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Often via market taxes, taxes on inns, poll taxes (i.e. tax per person), bridge/road taxes, etc


[1/5/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
But I kinda assume halflings would generally pay these, if they saw them as fair taxes for the stuff they are gettig (.e. use of a road)


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so this is a bit separate from landowning per se but the general view of halflings would not be "we don't pay those taxes" it would be "we offer you what is fair and negotiate"


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
And it probably comes out in the wash, i.e. the one time the baron gets stiffed, but some other time a halfling caravan pays 10x as much


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[1/5/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
So mostly who is going to complain


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that people should see halflings a bit like a lottery ticket but with fair odds


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
and then human pyschology takes over and the stories of winning circulate in a way that the stories of losing don't


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
Right the other bit is mandatory gifts, i.e. the lord of manor might expect gifts from everyone on the birth of the heir


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
but of course, this would also apply might more gently to halflings


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea of a mandatory gift would probably be seen as quite offensive by halflings


[1/5/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
No one "demands" the halflings pay the gift, the lord lets it be known this has happened, and hopes for the best


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
Right but the idea of giving the lord a present on the birth of the heir, if the lord has been a huge boon to the local halfling community would not be weird at all


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
And might also be quite substantial


[1/5/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
no, of course not, it could be vastly more than what you would expect


[1/5/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
this all plays into the lottery idea. if you keep the hallings that pass through your land happy and safe, then when your heir is born maybe you'll get something truly huge


[1/5/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/5/2024 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
The only other source of money I have that would be very offensive to halflings is the idea of local monopolies


[1/5/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
and the story about how the lord of such-place's son got a dozen horses for a wedding gift from some halflings he'd never even met before travels far and wide (probably in part helped by halflings themselves)

{Reactions}
👍

[1/5/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah halflings would just basically ignore those


[1/5/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
Probably one of the few things that would cause true conflict; if some lord's main source of incoming is the local monopoly on brewing, and a hafling decides to open a brewery/inn in the same town, the lord might not really have any good options


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but of course the halflings would know this, and although they should feel chaotic it isn't totally capricious


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
But I suspect that is quite rare, as these types of monopolies are usually on stuff like milling, brewing, bakehouses, etc not say "selling glassware"


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right. But that's how they punish the grandson of the lord who didn't let them build an inn without punishing the whole town


[1/5/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
So to the poor grandson, maybe it really does seem capricious because he doesn't know that his grandfather refused a halfling deal


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
But that all works well, I think


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
it is caprcious to the humans but not the halflings


[1/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
I think dwarves and local monopolies is more interesting; what I have in my notes is that the dwarves are given permission to ignore the local monopoly as long as they don't sell to humans. To me, that seems reasonable, but not sure your thoughts


[1/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i think dwarves are the most likely of any non-human race to have substantial "dwarven quarters" in human cities and towns


[1/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
so that does have a certain logic


[1/5/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i think depending on the size of the local dwarven community you'd have a variety of arrangements, but that feels like a plausible option


[1/5/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right. It isn't one size fits all on the Sembaran side either, a lot depends on the specific baron and duchy and lord


[1/5/2024 4:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i also think it is worth keeping in mind a little rare species like elves, centaurs, stoneborn, various fey, etc. they are rare enough that this is mostly going to be kind of one-off arrangements


[1/5/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
which would mostly exist outside of typical human rules and understanding


[1/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think there are no "general rules" outside of lizardfolk/halflings/dwarves.


[1/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
And even for halflings there are probably no laws, more folklore and word of mouth about how to best deal with them


[1/5/2024 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/7/2024 5:38 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a weird glitch with the website export where the callout boxes work when there is no pronunciation but don't work when there is a pronunciation. e.g. https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/Istaros%20Watershed/Orenlas/Erelion.html vs https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/Western%20Green%20Sea/Tollen/Tollen.html

haven't had a chance to read this stuff yet but did poke around a little bit about alternative website options, and wondering if you have opinions. 

Option 1: Quartz
https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/
JavaScript React-style static site generator
Pros: 
- understands Obsidian markdown natively so can go from processed vault -> html directly as a Github Action
- includes decent search, backlinks, popover previews, a number of other nice features
- heavily used in the Obsidian community if r/obsidianmd is accurate
Cons:
- written in TypeScript so fancy customization requires writing TypeScript (e.g., getting Leaflet to work or something)
- does not have nearly the ecosystem of themes and plugins that other static site generators have

Option 2: Material for mkdocs, Hugo, Jekyll or another "big" static site generator
https://github.com/collections/static-site-generators
Pros:
- usually have big communities, lots of themes/plugins, comprehensive documentation for setting up on Github Pages
- similar to the build process for my lab website so have some experience with this setup

Cons:
- would require some markdown cleanup to convert obsidian-flavored markdown to something else, including injection of backlinks and other 'obsidian-ish' content worth preserving
- requires some searching/optimizing to figure out the best option among a number of possibilities

Option 3: Obsidian

oops


[1/9/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Option 3 coming


[1/9/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Option 3: Obsidian Digital Garden
something like https://dg-docs.ole.dev/
Pros:


[1/9/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Pros:
- build entirely as an obsidian plugin; potentially supports dataview and other complex things like that

Cons:
- build entirely as an obsidian plugin, so it can be kind of annoying to modify, extend, etc.


[1/9/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Another con:
- requires tagging notes to be published


[1/9/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
On a quick peak, Quartz seems promising


[1/9/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
I don't love a solution inside obsidian, as I suspect it is the hardest to make work, and is probably highly tied to the obsidian UI


[1/9/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
Typescript is just Javascript with some nice bits, so it is not a stretch from the existing script code-base


[1/9/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
Quartz also can use rehype/remark plugins although I don't know what that is


[1/9/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
It might be worth looking at how hard getting something like leaflet to work is


[1/9/2024 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
Lots of good lore drops there.


[1/9/2024 8:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I thought you'd appreciate that


[1/9/2024 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
Helpful to know the stuff I know out of game in game 😀


[1/9/2024 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have anything canonical about dwarven coins?


[1/9/2024 9:03 PM] rsulfuratus
no


[1/9/2024 9:03 PM] rsulfuratus
only think semi-canonical is dwarven trade bars are stamped and marked to indicate a certain weight of gold or silver in standard sizes and are typically trusted/commonly used for large transactions


[1/9/2024 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
right, I've actually used that in my game as well


[1/9/2024 11:04 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at your Sembara coinage - in practice I feel like this is more trouble than it is worth, unless your players are much more interested in tracking minutiae than my players


[1/9/2024 11:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean it is fine to make up - I actually have some old notes on dwarven, dunmari, and chardonian coins - but i have never found it worth the trouble to actually use these in a game


[1/10/2024 7:30 AM] .deciusmus
The only bit I’d use in game is the flavor about debased metals during the 1550s - 1650s, so I might say have a treasure horde with thousands of coins from the reign of Bertram I which are not worth as much as it seems


[1/10/2024 7:31 AM] .deciusmus
The other bit I might use in game is words, ie “that drink is a halfbit please”. But we don’t keep track of every coin spent and everything converts to ~10 gp units ultimately for tracking


[1/10/2024 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
A few more website thoughts after fiddling with quartz and with obsidian-export a bit.

quartz is very easy to set up and do some basic customization with, it also handles obsidian-style wikilinks and file renaming to get nicer urls natively; it does not strip comments (%% text %%); the search is only adequate; it does not handle folder pages very well (requires them to be named index.md); and it is has only limited ability to handle things like timelines and tables. some formatting quirks with lists and newlines and page titles but these can probably be fixed with config options.

obsidian-export basically is only useful for converting wikilinks to something else; it does not handle admonitions, comment stripping, or anything else like that

material for mkdocs is more work to set up, but is ultimately a lot more customizable that quartz. however it is complicated enough i don't have a simple working test page locally, so there is more of a heavy lift to start with


[1/10/2024 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
probably, the best workflow is something like:
taelgar-utils (strip comments, secrets, dataview queries that will not be static-ified, clean up tags/headers/metadata as desired)
templater export (static-ify dataview)
quartz (produce html/layout)


[1/10/2024 11:44 AM] rsulfuratus
that would require a few tweaks to taelgar-utils to support things that quartz doesn't (primarily removing comments)


[1/10/2024 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
then the quartz step can happen as a github action, so the website build process is:
run taelgar-utils to create new vault in website repo
open vault
run exporter
push


[1/10/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
if we instead wanted more flexible customization options with hugo/jekyll/mkdocs/whatever
you would need to add a "fix wikilinks" step and possibly some other reformatting


[1/10/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but this would mostly be able to be handled by obsidian-export


[1/10/2024 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
note that because quartz is JS, it would in theory be possible to run the existing scripts as quartz plugins


[1/10/2024 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
except can you call the obsidian API outside of obsidian?


[1/10/2024 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
that seems tricky


[1/10/2024 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
Well no. But the entire set of JS code only uses the obisidian API in 1 place


[1/10/2024 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
NameManager.getFileForTarget


[1/10/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
(and dv.current() in a few places to get the "current" page, but I think it only reads metadata from the current page, so that should be handled by the quartz plugin, which passes the same conceptual thing)


[1/10/2024 11:50 AM] .deciusmus
that said, NameManager.getFileForTarget is a key function and without looking at quartz I don't know how easy it is to find a file based on a link text item


[1/10/2024 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
it must be able to since this is how it parses and links wikilinks style text


[1/10/2024 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
that said I'm not actually sure how valuable this would be


[1/10/2024 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
it probably isn't, really


[1/10/2024 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
honestly. because it is pretty easy to just staticify stuff


[1/10/2024 11:53 AM] rsulfuratus
you could remove the need to open obsidian for the prepare for export step but otherwise I don't think it gets you much since you still can't link the website to the main vault


[1/10/2024 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
the only reason to go that route is if we ever move off github pages and do something like get taelgarverse.org served by a cloudfare backend that could then be set up to automatically generate separate taelgarverse.org pages based on a set of static dates


[1/10/2024 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
mostly it might be interesting if I wanted to play with more modern javascript stuff, honestly


[1/10/2024 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
I don't do a lot of node/JS functions only/etc


[1/10/2024 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
well sure as a coding project its fine


[1/10/2024 11:55 AM] .deciusmus
But I guess I am just saying the shared Javascript architecture is a (small) benefit of Quartz


[1/10/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
well, you can add javascript to any of the static site generators


[1/10/2024 11:56 AM] .deciusmus
ah, well then


[1/10/2024 11:56 AM] .deciusmus
maybe it doesn't matter


[1/10/2024 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
Honestly the thing I care about the most is getting leaflet to work


[1/10/2024 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
that is my biggest hesitation with committing to quartz


[1/10/2024 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. this looks fairly possible: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/discussions/2498

[1/10/2024 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
and there are dozens of repos with various implementations of leaflet in hugo or jekyll


[1/10/2024 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
it should be theoretically possible to make a quartz plugin that runs leaflet but this would be definitely trickier


[1/10/2024 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
this is nice on mkdocs:

[1/10/2024 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
having the bio blocks nest on the left/right of content would look a lot nicer


[1/10/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
I think the taelgar_utils would have to convert obisidian-style callouts to mkdocs style though


[1/10/2024 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah or I was thinking you could also nest an image on the right of the bio block


[1/10/2024 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, if we go the mkdocs route than taelgar-utils needs to strip comments and convert callouts


[1/10/2024 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
in that case I might also just handle link cleanup as well in taelgar-utils, which is not that hard and could then also handle path renaming to generate nicer urls without all the spaces


[1/10/2024 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
just searched the quartz discord and github issues and there is no mention of leaflet in either, except one github comment saying supporting it was out of scope


[1/10/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
mkdocs plugins look pretty straightforward as well


[1/10/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
how are you currently managing stripping non-linked content? does taelgar-utils do that, or did you just publish everything?


[1/10/2024 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
I have the obsidianhtml config set up to strip non-linked content


[1/10/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
ah, right, obsidianthml is still being used


[1/10/2024 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/10/2024 1:41 PM] .deciusmus
Mkdocs really seems like a better choice honestly. I found plugins for callouts and wiki links and it has a very simple extension architecture for one off scripts via a hooks.pu

[1/10/2024 1:47 PM] .deciusmus
The idea would be that taelgar-utils vanishes, it becomes some hooks on the mkdocs template


[1/10/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
Only bit I don’t see an obvious way to do is (a) leaflet (b) filtering out unwanted files via something more complex than gitignore file-syntax


[1/10/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
But both should be pretty straightforward


[1/10/2024 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
But the file filter would probably be pretty easy via https://github.com/mfarragher/obsidiantools

[1/10/2024 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
And the mkdocs “files” hook


[1/10/2024 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
The file hook is a python function which takes a set of files mkdoc wants to include in the site and returns a modified list


[1/10/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
You could in theory just use the obsidian tools to build a graph then get all the nodes in the graph that are reachable from the index.md root


[1/10/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Would also be not hard to do things like have frontmatter:
excludePublish: [campaign, campaign] or something so if either of us wanted to restrict access to pages you wouldn’t have to worry about links.


[1/10/2024 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I basically had the same thought


[1/10/2024 2:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I have been testing some python functions with taelgar-utils but it should be trivial to lift them into mkdocs hooks


[1/10/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i have strip comments, strip campaign info, and strip by date working fine


[1/10/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
as simple python functions that just take text


[1/10/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
Right, so the idea would be to just add that to a taelgar_hooks.py with an on_markdown or whatever it is called


[1/10/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[1/10/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
this is a good example

[1/10/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so the workflow is going to be:
copy files to new location in some fashion
run export in obsidian
push, using github actions to run python code to clean up markdown and then let mkdocs build html


[1/10/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
Conceptually it would be possible to change the export-in-obsidian to generate static blocks for each registered campaign, i.e. something like

%%Campaign:^DuFr%%
info block for dumar
%%End

%%Campaign:^Cleen%%
info block for cleen
%%End


[1/10/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
which would mean the github actions side could in theory generate 2 different sites


[1/10/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
not sure if that is worthwhile


[1/10/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think that is worthwhile


[1/10/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
the one other thing to consider is slugifying links, I personally really dislike the `https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/Gazetteer/Greater%20Dunmar/Garamjala%20Plateau/Garamjala%20Desert.html`


[1/10/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
with a lot of %20s in them


[1/10/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/10/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
I would guess there is a standard plugin for that


[1/10/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah it looks fairly easy

[1/10/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/10/2024 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
there are other bits of annoyingness that would need to be cleaned up, e.g. want a python hook that replaces (DR:: 1748-01-01) with text


[1/10/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/10/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
at least on mac, the ezlinks plugin is kind of crappy, it is case sensitive but obsidian is not so tons of links break


[1/10/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
are you using the ezlinked or ezlinks?


[1/10/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
ezlinked


[1/10/2024 3:24 PM] .deciusmus
but yes, I noticed the case sensitive issue


[1/10/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
still crappy


[1/10/2024 3:24 PM] .deciusmus
It seems to have 2 issues:
- It can't link to a page that has the same name as the folder
- links are case senstive


[1/10/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
so, there might be another way to run this. basically, you could have a source directory and then a hook that builds the md files in the docs directory. this is how we do a lot of my lab page (except from json + md templates)


[1/10/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
then the website directory would have taelgar main vault as a submodule


[1/10/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
building website would just be update submodule and push


[1/10/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
then we could just have custom python code to catch the various link quirks and other things


[1/10/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
and could easily slugify, etc


[1/10/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
e..g pretty easy to convert:
[[the Traveler]] -> [the Traveler](../rel/path/to/the-traveler.md)


[1/10/2024 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
and to convert every file to lowercase-dash-space.md


[1/10/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/10/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
ah...hmm..might even be more straightforward. you can have a github action that checks out a repo. 

so the website repo can, in theory, just be some mkdocs styling and python code, when you push it triggers:
checkout taeglar
run hooks to build docs
publish


[1/10/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
to build locally you'd I think need to manually clone repo before running mkdocs serve


[1/10/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
then you'd just have like a date.yaml or something and if you want to update webiste should be as simple as bumping date and then push


[1/10/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think in that structure, you'd have taelgar_export.py or whatever, which reads a json with:
campaign
target_date
build_date

in then creates the docs directory, stripping comments and cleaning links.

the github action would be set up to run if website.json was updated, and would:


[1/10/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
1. checkout taelgar
2. run taelgar_export.py as a pre-build hook


[1/10/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't played around with github actions really at all


[1/10/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
you are thinking we'd each have a repo that has taelgar as a submodule


[1/10/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah

[1/10/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
it can't just checkout taelgar as it needs to have the static-ified version


[1/10/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm, yeah


[1/10/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
then you would need to do that locally


[1/10/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
basically you'd want it as a submodule


[1/10/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
so you git pull; open obsidian and staticify; then git push


[1/10/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think it might be easier to push inside obisidian


[1/10/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
there are lots of obisidan plugins that push to a git repo

[1/10/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
Pretty sure that's the right solution


[1/10/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
You don't need to copy the vault or anything.
Just open your existing vault.
Run static template
Run github publish
Git revert to discard changes


[1/10/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
the github publish cleans the files in obsidian & then pushes to a **different** github repo


[1/10/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
so it doesn't touch the "real" one


[1/10/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
to me that seems more of a pain but in principle it shouldn't actually matter


[1/10/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
More of a pain than what?


[1/10/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
that is, we don't have to agree on how to go from "live" vault -> static vault


[1/10/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/10/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
more of a pain than:
git pull
open vault; run export in place
git push


[1/10/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
well, the key thing about the obisidian published plugin is it pushes to github itself


[1/10/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
you can't git push


[1/10/2024 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
the setup is:
taelgar repo
(mike) website repo
(tim) website repo

each website repo needs a "source" directory that is a static clone of the taelgar repo, which will be parsed by export_taelgar.py or whatever

how you get a static clone into the source directory shouldn't matter


[1/10/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/10/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the only key thing is you need:
(a) the static content to get pushed to a specific directory in the website repo
(b) github actions set up to build mkdocs with the taelgar_export hook when the static content is updated


[1/10/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus

(not dataviewjs, unforuntately)


[1/10/2024 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i fiddled around a fair bit with some python. conceptually it definitely feels like it will be quite possible to get an mkdocs site working but there are a bunch of fiddly details to figure out and debug. 

the basic protocol of static source -> python hook -> website though feels like it should work, regardless of how the static source is generated

dealing with slugification of urls and converting wikilinks is a huge pain, i can kind of understand why all the existing implementations are kind of buggy


[1/10/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
The plug-in I suggested above is kinda crap after all. It has all these nice features but they don’t really work


[1/10/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i can't say i'm super surprised


[1/10/2024 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
I was starting to look at just updating my template code. Obsidian has a “get file” api


[1/10/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
I think it would actually be fairly easy to:
Use a regex to get [[]]
Split on |
Call obsidian.getLinkpath or whatever to get the full filename to the link
Output md link


[1/10/2024 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
Could just do it in the same loop that outputs the static template

[1/10/2024 9:51 PM] .deciusmus
The other bit would be converting anything where the final dest matches the folder to folder/index.md


[1/10/2024 9:52 PM] .deciusmus
Then folder notes work nicely - as long as some script converts matches to index.md


[1/10/2024 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
I didn’t get a chance to try it out tonight but I might take a stab at having the “prep-export” modify links tomorrow depending on how busy I am at work.


[1/11/2024 9:43 AM] .deciusmus
Depending on what my afternoon looks like, here is the workflow I am thinking of trying to implement:

1. Run the "prepare for export" template in the vault. This will:
   (step 1) process all files with a headerversion attribute and make headers static
   (step 2) read main.md and recursively follow its links, setting shared: true in the front matter of any reachable page. Pages in MOC, DM, and Worldbuilding will be skipped and so the won't count for reachability.
   (step 3) read all files and update the links to be markdown links rather than wikilinks. This will remove links that point to files where shared: true doesn't exist, and will point to index.md on files that share a name with their immediate parent direction

2. Run the github publisher above, with no modification of file content, exporting only shared: true, and converting folder named-files to index.md. This will push to the docs folder in the website repo.

3. Github actions triggers MkDocs which uses taelgar_hooks.py to strip comments and strip %%Campaign:%% and %%Date:%% stuff


[1/11/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not going to mess around with websites until after the session tonight (most likely over the long weekend), but my plan is to work on taelgar_hooks.py which will be configurable by a website.json file, and will by default strip comments/campaign/date and optionally (a) slugify files, (b) convert links, and (c) skip files by name/glob/graph/tag/graph connectivity


[1/11/2024 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
(b) and (c) are duplicative of what I'm proposing in the js code above


[1/11/2024 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
but you can't slugify files without also fixing links


[1/11/2024 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
otherwise all your links will break because they don't point to a file anymore


[1/11/2024 11:19 AM] rsulfuratus
but actually i don't think it matters if there is both a js and a python implementation with slightly different twists


[1/11/2024 11:20 AM] .deciusmus
well, you can convert [The Cleansed](The%20Cleansed.md) to [The Cleansed](the-cleansed.md)


[1/11/2024 11:20 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. the order should probably be convert->slugify


[1/11/2024 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
for mkdocs you need [The Cleansed](../../Groups/the-cleansed.md)


[1/11/2024 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
Right but I was going to do that via the javascript prepare for export


[1/11/2024 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
not the slugifying


[1/11/2024 11:47 AM] .deciusmus
but the convert to MD links


[1/11/2024 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
which I think is trivial with the obisidian api as it gives you a list of inks on the page


[1/11/2024 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
poking around a little, i actually think that handling the relative link generation is best done as an mkdocs plugin, since that means that the folder names can change / move as desired to e.g. generate a nice nav structure or whatever


[1/11/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
we already enforce unique file names so it is pretty trivial to just let a plugin handle converting [Link Text](note-name.md) to proper relative links


[1/11/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
that also allows slugification of folder names if desired


[1/11/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
The biggest issue I’ve seen is folder notes


[1/11/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
Lots of existing tools that turn wiki links into markdown and lots of tools that turn Sembara/Semabara.md into Sembara/index.md


[1/11/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
there are lots of plugins to handle that though, e.g. something like https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-literate-nav/

https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/dgC54vBV-phFopZn7cDGR9NixVW_Cc6CMbykPdntlAU/https/pypi.org/static/images/twitter.abaf4b19.webp


[1/11/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
But I haven’t found anything that works together to let the link like [[Sembara]] become [Sembara](sembara/index.md)


[1/11/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
I looked at literate nav it requires specifying the entire tree which is too much work


[1/11/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i think you'd need to do it programatically. but if you want slugified urls and nice looking nav there is as far as I can tell no other choice


[1/11/2024 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. you can either use index.md and section notes to have:
Greater Sembaba link to Gazetteer/Greater Sembara/index.md

but then either the url is:
Gazetteer/Greater%20Sembara

or the nav display is:
greater-sembara (or I guess Greater-Sembara)


[1/11/2024 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
if you programatically generate an actual nav, you can have:
Greater Sembara -> gazetteer/greater-sembara/greater-sembara.md


[1/11/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
at least as I understand it


[1/11/2024 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
Yes I think that is probably true. I didn’t think about the implications of slugifying links


[1/11/2024 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
Although if you programmatically generating the entire nav the actual folder structure doesn’t matter at all


[1/11/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
And also no reason to rename to index.md


[1/11/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think actually not have the nav tied to the folder structure is a big positive. e.g., for the my version of taelgarverse I might want a top level nav item: "Campaign Notes" which points to Dunmari Frontier, and the top level nav item "Other Campaigns" which points to other campaigns


[1/11/2024 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
Right.


[1/11/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I also might want to explicitly exclude ~Unnamed~ files from nav


[1/11/2024 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
So the GitHub publisher plug-in I linked above is pretty good at publishing and renaming wiki links —- it just can’t handle folder notes


[1/11/2024 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
see also: https://oprypin.github.io/mkdocs-gen-files/


[1/11/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
But maybe folder notes are the wrong approach and having the hook generate the nav on the mkdocs size is better


[1/11/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
*side


[1/11/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
I almost have the “set shared:true” in the front matter of all reachable files working


[1/11/2024 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
this is also quite powerful: https://github.com/fralau/mkdocs-macros-plugin

[1/11/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
And from there — as long as I don’t care about the nav having 

Sembara:
* Sembara

The GitHub publish works really well


[1/11/2024 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not ever going to use the github publish workflow because I am basically 100% certain it is not going to work with my secrets filter


[1/11/2024 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
That is true it won’t


[1/11/2024 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
so my build process is always going to be pull a fresh copy of taelgar repo into the source dir (which will have secrets as %%SECRET[1]%%), and then run the export code, and push


[1/11/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, secrets will get stripped correctly by the mkdocs plugin so it depends a bit on whether you care if the GitHub repo for your taelgarverse has the secrets or not


[1/11/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
But the advantage of the shared: true approach is that it doesn’t require agreement on what to push to where or how


[1/11/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
A python hook can just only include markdowns with shared true


[1/11/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
right I'm also not sure that I actually want to strip non-linked pages


[1/11/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
so that will be optional in the python hook


[1/11/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Maybe I should call the front matter “rooted: true”


[1/11/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
It just means there is no need to calculate rooted in python. If you want to know if a page is rooted just check the front matter


[1/11/2024 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
rooted is trivial with the obsidiantools package but annoying complicated otherwise


[1/11/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
but obsidiantools is quite slow on a big set of files so would prefer not to have to install and run that as a github action or the website will take 20 minutes to build


[1/11/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
so that is quite nice to have in the metadata


[1/11/2024 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
Rooted is quite complex because ultimately almost everything is rooted from anywhere

[1/11/2024 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, it isn't complicated per se, it is just pointless without more work


[1/11/2024 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
the big thing is just making sure that the files are slugified because it converts [[File Name]] to [File Name](file_name.md)


[1/11/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
actually nevermind, roamlinks seems to work completely fine for all wikilinks


[1/11/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think no need to fix links


[1/11/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
right, if no folder pages (because nav is generated)


[1/11/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
Ok I have the rooted stuff working


[1/11/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
It starts from main.md and follows links recursively, seetting "rooted: true" on each page it reaches


[1/11/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
if a page has excludeRooted: ["key", "key2" ] then links on that page are not followed


[1/11/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
you specify the key when you start the export


[1/11/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. excludeRooted: ["Clee"] set on a page means if you are generating rooted things for Clee, don't follow links on that page


[1/11/2024 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
okay roamlinks works fine but it is annoying slow, since it walks the directory tree for every link it finds, instead of caching information, so it takes 3-4 minutes to build the website


[1/11/2024 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
mkdocs uses the `title` metadata field to determine document names, so you get a bunch of `Lord` etc in the nav panel


[1/11/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
ok, I am going to push a change which updates the prepare for export template so that it adds rooted: true


[1/11/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
it starts from main.md, follows paths, sets rooted: true in header


[1/11/2024 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
you can make a page not be part of the path follow via 
excludedRooted: [key] as above


[1/11/2024 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
I've addeda  bunch of excludedRooted: ["Clee"] to various pages

[1/12/2024 9:51 AM] rsulfuratus
I mostly have a lot of real work to do today but I did make a few bugfix changes to the python hooks, and it looks like I have slugification and relative links working correctly

this is pushed as export_vault.py in taelgar-utils

poking around, I am seeing a lot of visual bugs, mostly having to do with quirks of obsidian markdown (e.g., sometimes the callout boxes turn into code blocks)

there are also the annoyances like pages with `title` frontmatter set to Lord or Queen, pages without an H1 (which get a slugified name instead of title case or whatever), (DR:: ) display tags, obsolete dview inline code, code blocks not wrapped with %%Campaign:None%%

the question for me is: which of these should be considered bugs that need to be fixed in obsidian, which are bugs but will be cleaned for display, and which should be considered conversion issues that the python hook will handle?

so far I've only tackled links. so far I consider things like [[Cosomology/Echo Realms/Feywild]] to be a bug but my code fixes it; I consider things like broken links to [[The Battle of Tokra]] instead of the [[Battle of Tokra]] to be a bug but I don't fix in

I am likely to tackle the `title` frontmatter issue and the (DR: )) issue next, as those are both definitely visual conversion requirements

missing H1, various display bugs in the summary boxes, untranslated inline dview code, and code blocks I'm less certain


[1/12/2024 9:55 AM] .deciusmus
I would be careful about changing anything that
(a) looks like a bug in obisidian as well (i.e. either of your bad links)
(b) anything inside the generated header


[1/12/2024 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
I have a few tweaks to the generate header code (baked into the same logic that static-ifies it for export) to make the callouts work better on mkdocs


[1/12/2024 9:58 AM] .deciusmus
mostly there are issues with callouts 

```
> sss
sss
> sss
```

or 

```
> ssss
>> sss
> ss
```

where MkDocs prefers

```
> sss
> sss
> sss
```

Or

```
> sss
> > sss
> > sss
```


[1/12/2024 9:58 AM] .deciusmus
But that is a lot easier to fix in the gen-header than anywhere else

[1/12/2024 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
if you install the Image Toolkit plugin


[1/12/2024 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus
is this to support better image display with mkdocs?


[1/12/2024 10:05 AM] .deciusmus
Having the image in the frontmatter and then included in a standard place makes it a lot easier to control what happens in mkdocs


[1/12/2024 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
and actually also because I like the images smaller and clikable in obisidia as well


[1/12/2024 10:06 AM] rsulfuratus
obsidian doesn't really support proper alignment though or responsive display for smaller screens without a lot of fiddling with css


[1/12/2024 10:06 AM] rsulfuratus
what does that header look like if you make the obisidan window narrow?


[1/12/2024 10:07 AM] rsulfuratus
like 1/3 your screen or something

[1/12/2024 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
it works by setting the image as 

image|right|300

and then with a custom CSS style for "right" images


[1/12/2024 10:09 AM] .deciusmus
But I added a taelgar-fixes.css to the gitingore exclude list so functional css stuff can be easily shared


[1/12/2024 10:10 AM] .deciusmus
the bigger issue in making the bio blocks look nice is that the location stuff sometimes gets really long


[1/12/2024 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that I would be more interested in getting a nice website set up with proper navigation and fixing bugs before tackling images. i need to think about images a bit. I do think having an image file name stored in frontmatter would be very useful for lots of things


[1/12/2024 10:14 AM] .deciusmus
The very first thing I ran into when getting the website is frustration and how bad the images look


[1/12/2024 10:14 AM] .deciusmus
I hate the default bio block on the default website that is then followed by a **gianormous** image soon after


[1/12/2024 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
but that is mostly just because we never really set image sizes


[1/12/2024 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
Partially, but I think also it is hard to make things looking nice if there isn't a consistent place on the page for the image.


[1/12/2024 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
or more specifically the image really looks a lot better if it is inside the bio block, and having it inside the bio block makes it easy to style via css


[1/12/2024 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
but it is very difficult to make it appear inside the bio block in mkdocs but outside the bio block in obisidian as images are not well enough defined in our structure right now


[1/12/2024 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't know, at the moment image usage feels way too random


[1/12/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
i think it is hard to standardize


[1/12/2024 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
I dunno, I have lots of npcs that are not that much more than a bio block and an image


[1/12/2024 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
lots of cases where the images are not part of the bio block, i.e. random pages or something, but I don't think it is random at all


[1/12/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
right we just have totally different styles is the problem


[1/12/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
i basially only have images for a small number of npcs and usually people with dense pages


[1/12/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
I don't think i have any npcs (except a few kenku where i was enjoying playing around with getting kenku to work with midjourney) that are just image + bioblock


[1/12/2024 10:21 AM] rsulfuratus
and for many of my npcs it actually makes a ton more sense for the image to be in the "description" section


[1/12/2024 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
i've tried like 5 times to standardize npc pages and ultimately have just decided it doesn't work because i tend not to just invent npcs outside of a game context, so the information i record about them is widely varying not based even on importance but just kind of randomness. if i'm doing random worldbuilding it is almost always geography, not people


[1/12/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
I personally like say the Caelynn page  a lot better with the image in the bio block than the description. It just feels more natural, especially with a lightbox effect


[1/12/2024 10:24 AM] .deciusmus
But really I have a lot of pages like this

[1/12/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
right. i think the correct approach though is not try to standarize


[1/12/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
have a bioblock_image or something frontmatter that if set gives you the first thing


[1/12/2024 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
well, I don't see any value in having an image: in the frontmatter that is ignored


[1/12/2024 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
but otherwise, what are we disagreeing about?


[1/12/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't necessarily want npc images in headers


[1/12/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
(sorry bioblocks)


[1/12/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
but i don't care what you do with your npcs


[1/12/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
and it is isn't like i hate it


[1/12/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
so you can set bioblock_image: profile.png and get your headers


[1/12/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
and i can leave it blank and have an image in the note


[1/12/2024 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
at some point i might have a different idea for images but i don't think it makes sense to try to "solve" images in their entirty since it feels to me quite complicated


[1/12/2024 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
have you tested the mkdocs-glightbox plugin btw?


[1/12/2024 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
yeah it works great


[1/12/2024 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
that's what started me on this path


[1/12/2024 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
I actually like this better:

[1/12/2024 10:33 AM] .deciusmus
but it is way harder to make work via frontmatter


[1/12/2024 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah but if the obisidian css supports alignment that can be translated to mkdocs, maybe it is fine to just have to make things look nice in obsidian


[1/12/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
right


[1/12/2024 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
if you grab my css, the above is just

[1/12/2024 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
and then 

img[alt*="right"] {
    float: right;    
    margin-left: 1rem;
    margin-right: 1rem;
    margin-top: 0;
}


[1/12/2024 10:38 AM] .deciusmus
mkdocs supports the 300 piece automatically


[1/12/2024 10:39 AM] .deciusmus
having a lightbox (either the mkdocs plugin or the obsidian image toolkit) installed is crucial, so you can clck to zoom


[1/12/2024 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I haven't really messed around with getting the style I like in mkdocs for bio blocks though


[1/12/2024 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
well roamlinks supports the 300 piece automatically


[1/12/2024 10:40 AM] rsulfuratus
or whatever native link translation mkdocs does


[1/12/2024 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I believe it becomes the alt-text for the image


[1/12/2024 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
and there is some magic css


[1/12/2024 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
but I'm not totally sure


[1/12/2024 10:41 AM] rsulfuratus
roamlinks converts it to {width = 300}


[1/12/2024 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
is there are reason you use image|align|size instead of e.g. image|size,align?


[1/12/2024 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess for the css


[1/12/2024 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
I don't thik size,align works? are you saying mkdocs does something with it?


[1/12/2024 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. sets float: x automatically


[1/12/2024 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
or I mean romlinks


[1/12/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
no, it would just be easier to parse into:
[image](link){width = size}{align = left}


[1/12/2024 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
but that doesn't do any good in obisidian


[1/12/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that is why i was asking if the css could parse that syntax


[1/12/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
but i guess it cant


[1/12/2024 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
it breaks the obisidian sizing


[1/12/2024 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
the css does but obsidian doesn't now how to size the image anymore


[1/12/2024 10:44 AM] .deciusmus

[1/12/2024 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[1/12/2024 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
the only problem with [[image.png|right|300]] is that is breaks alt text since you overload it for alignment. which is not i guess the worst thing


[1/12/2024 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus
it would be easy to extend the roamlinsk parser I'm using the export_vault.py to add that alignment from alt text as long as we never use alt text for anything but alignment


[1/12/2024 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
this works as well
![[caelynn-portrait.png|portrait of Caelynn|right|300]]


[1/12/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
roamlinks won't parse that correctly


[1/12/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
but I think conceptually we are not actually going to set real alt text


[1/12/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
are you sure?


[1/12/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
I was pretty sure it parsed
![[caelynn-portrait.png|right|300]]


[1/12/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
how is 
![[caelynn-portrait.png|portrait of Caelynn|right|300]] different?


[1/12/2024 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
this is the regex, you can test yourself: `\[\[(.*?)(\#.*?)?(?:\|([\D][^\|\]]+[\d]*))?(?:\|(\d+)(?:x(\d+))?)?\]\]`


[1/12/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
in either case the "actual" alt text is portrait of Caelynn|right


[1/12/2024 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
no, it parses from the end


[1/12/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I mean in obisidian


[1/12/2024 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
right i'm saying in roamlinks you get file = "caelynn-portrait.png|portrait of Caelynn"


[1/12/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
which of course won't work


[1/12/2024 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/12/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
could change that since i'm not actually using roamlinks plugin, i'm just using their wikilinks parser class


[1/12/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
but it gets a bit annoying


[1/12/2024 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
I mean, if you are making changes, it would be a lot nicer to set a CSS class rather than alt-text


[1/12/2024 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
right i can easily set `{ align=left }` or `{ align=right}`


[1/12/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
you don't want to set align, you want to set { class =  }


[1/12/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
I think


[1/12/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
because it might be more than just an alignment


[1/12/2024 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus

[1/12/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
there were some issues I had with that, I am not 100% sure what


[1/12/2024 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
setting custom css is going to get incredibly annoying unless we just don't care at all about small screens though


[1/12/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
it is more flexible to do
{ .name }


[1/12/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
which adds .name as a css class to the element


[1/12/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
which makes it very easy to style


[1/12/2024 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
but it is probably better to see what looks nice in mkdocs first


[1/12/2024 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
part of this has to do with figuring out the right mkdocs look, and then how close that is to obsidian


[1/12/2024 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. to get a wikipedia style look

almost certainly a different strategy would be needed because the image would have to be in frontmatter in order to insert it into the bio block

[1/12/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/12/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
but i also think that there are some advantages to letting the obsidian style be a little loose and doing style conversion in code


[1/12/2024 11:02 AM] .deciusmus
css style yes sure


[1/12/2024 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
and markdown -> html, sure. But I don't think it makes sense to say parse the entire markdown and try to identify if an image should or sholdnt move somewhere


[1/12/2024 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
why not? that is pretty easy to do and if example, the assumption is that an person page with only one image should be processed in x way


[1/12/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
I don't think that is a good assumption though


[1/12/2024 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
Well, okay, then it is harder to do


[1/12/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
I prefer declarative to magical


[1/12/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. I don't want to have the mkdocs flow do something weird. What if the one image I put on a page is a scene of a battle? Or something that was found? Should mkdocs even know that something is a "person"?


[1/12/2024 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus
I mean fair enough. My counter argument is that if the only way for the website to look good is for every note to be formatted perfectly in obsidian the website is never going to look good


[1/12/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
Reformatting notes is pretty much always my lowest priority task and so is never actually finished


[1/12/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
In any case, my first goal is to fix navigation/page titles, and then to reformat (DR:: ) tags


[1/12/2024 11:12 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, although reformatting DR tags is its own can of worms if we ever get back to the dates stuff


[1/12/2024 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
but a simple easy cleanup is certainly sensible


[1/12/2024 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
I actually have mixed feelings about using DR tags at all, as opposed to just raw parsing the date, because the timeline code in JS doesn't care, it actually looks at all list items and then checks each list item for a date field. But it would be almost as easy to do something else


[1/12/2024 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
but not super interested in looking at tht right now so suggest you do whatever


[1/12/2024 11:25 AM] .deciusmus
anyway what I actually care about is a nice website bio block so I was going to mess around with that to the extend I do anything


[1/12/2024 11:26 AM] rsulfuratus
Yeah, that is all in the hands of the export code


[1/12/2024 11:26 AM] .deciusmus
I don't follow what your source + build directories are supposed to be


[1/12/2024 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
or more specifially, why do i have to set source and output


[1/12/2024 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
isn't that already in mkdocs?


[1/12/2024 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
are you even using mkdocs in your export_vault?


[1/12/2024 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
ah, I see, you are not intending it to be triggered by mkdocs at all.


[1/12/2024 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
no, it is triggered by mkdocs


[1/12/2024 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
export_hook.py reads files from source, and writes to output


[1/12/2024 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
it builds a new directory structure for slugification


[1/12/2024 11:30 AM] rsulfuratus
right now it makes the nav look really bad


[1/12/2024 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
output in website.json has to match the mkdocs source


[1/12/2024 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
how is it triggered by mkdocs?


[1/12/2024 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
make a scripts folder in your mkdocs directory and then put:
```
hooks:
  - scripts/export_vault.py
```


[1/12/2024 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
in the mkdocs.yml


[1/12/2024 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus
then mkdocs serve will run export_vault.py on build


[1/12/2024 11:32 AM] .deciusmus
I thoght you needed an on_xx function


[1/12/2024 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus
nope


[1/12/2024 11:32 AM] .deciusmus
wouldn't it be nicer though?


[1/12/2024 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus
no that is what I hate about roamlinks


[1/12/2024 11:32 AM] rsulfuratus
because it triggers on markdown, it has to search the directory tree again for every single md file


[1/12/2024 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus
my code run is like 45 seconds, if you use roamlinks to get rel paths it takes like 180


[1/12/2024 11:33 AM] rsulfuratus
the hooks run before mkdocs build


[1/12/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
I didn't mean the link-replacement, it is def better to do that wholesale


[1/12/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
the other stuff


[1/12/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. I did this
def on_page_markdown(markdown, files, page, config, **kwargs):
    config_hooks = config.get(
        "extra", {"hooks": {"campaign": "clee"}}
    ).get("hooks", {"campaign": "clee"})

    markdown = strip_campaign_content(markdown, "clee")
    markdown = strip_comments(markdown)

    return markdown

(stealing your strip code)


[1/12/2024 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
to not have %% litering my testing areas


[1/12/2024 11:34 AM] rsulfuratus
that is nicer for live preview for sure


[1/12/2024 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
i think for actually serving it doesn't matter


[1/12/2024 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
but it might be cleaner to pull out things that don't need directory access


[1/12/2024 11:35 AM] .deciusmus
right, by nicer I just meant easier to maintain


[1/12/2024 11:35 AM] .deciusmus
also conceptually nicer to have the config in mkdocs.yaml extra


[1/12/2024 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
rather than a separate json file


[1/12/2024 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/12/2024 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
everything that parses markdown is just a function anyway so it isn't hard to refactor


[1/12/2024 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
using something like https://www.mkdocs.org/dev-guide/plugins/#on_files to modify what files are built rather than a directory copy is probably a lot easier


[1/12/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
and actually the right approach for link update would probably be to build the index on_startup and modify the page in the on markdown but also likely not worth the trouble given most "live edits" testing doesn't require changing the links (and it is easy enough to type the markdown syntax if needed)


[1/12/2024 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't really see what the advantage of that would be to be honest


[1/12/2024 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
the only advantage is it works with mkdocs serve. but like I said, probably not worth it


[1/12/2024 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
although I guess the slugifying bit is complicated


[1/12/2024 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
it would be nice if you had slugifying optional


[1/12/2024 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
roamlinks is so slow I'd rather not use it, but I dont necessarily want to deal with the fallout from slugifying


[1/12/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
it is easy to make slugifying optional but a bit more annoying to make the file copy optional


[1/12/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
although actually if you make source = output in the json it should just overrite in place with relative links


[1/12/2024 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
i can make it an option later but I think it should work if you just change: ['file'] to ['orig'] in 
```
filename = str(self.path_dict[filename]['file'])
filename = str(self.path_dict[parts[-1]]['file'])
```

[1/12/2024 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
have meeting now, but might mess around a bit during lunch


[1/12/2024 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
and set SOURCE = OUTPUT = mkdocs "docs" directory


[1/12/2024 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
ah hmm actually a bit more complicated


[1/12/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a version with optional slugification


[1/12/2024 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
have not tested what happens if you set source = build in the config


[1/12/2024 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
the file link processing seems super-slow, is there a way to make that optional?


[1/12/2024 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
should it be taking >5 minutes?


[1/12/2024 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
nvm


[1/12/2024 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
you hard-coded the startingn point, I use index not main


[1/12/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
ah, the notice just wasn't going away, right?


[1/12/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/12/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
if it never runs, it doesn't hide the notice


[1/12/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
added a prompt to specify file to start checks from, and also made it optional (so if you dont specify a file root check doesn't run)


[1/12/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
is there a way to get the errors out?


[1/12/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
it says errors: 5 but I don't know what files they are


[1/12/2024 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
console log


[1/12/2024 1:16 PM] .deciusmus
How hard would it be to change the link code so it didn’t create broken links? Or does it already not?


[1/12/2024 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
it shouldn't create broken links


[1/12/2024 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
I haven’t tried it yet, just got off a meeting


[1/12/2024 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
well, i haven't checked, but that is the expected behavior of roamlinks


[1/12/2024 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
Roam links leaves them as [[]]


[1/12/2024 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
ah


[1/12/2024 1:17 PM] rsulfuratus
okay


[1/12/2024 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
I want it to just turn into plain text


[1/12/2024 1:18 PM] .deciusmus
Ie if you have:
[[session 82|killed]] I want to just get killed


[1/12/2024 1:31 PM] rsulfuratus
do you have an example page with an alias that doesn't have a link?


[1/12/2024 1:31 PM] rsulfuratus
or this is just generated from your parsing of unrooted pages


[1/12/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
I've been in meetings. Now I am not even 100% sure if it was roamlinks vs ezliks that left them behind


[1/12/2024 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realms is an example


[1/12/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
I have a typo in 
[[Lord Umbreth| Gloomshaper]],


[1/12/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
it should be
[[Lord Umbraeth| Gloomshaper]],


[1/12/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
and I thought I saw it come through as
[[Lord Umbreth| Gloomshaper]],

rather than
Gloomshaper

[1/12/2024 1:35 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a fix that removes [[]] from broken links

{Reactions}
👍

[1/12/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
set up to have taelgar repo as a submodule but you can fork it however you like if you have a different setup


[1/12/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
not currently running actions to actually serve a website


[1/12/2024 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
So your workflow is basically
1. sync repo
2. run export, where docs\ is empty
3. run mkdocs serve which populates docs


[1/12/2024 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/12/2024 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
just pushed an update to export_vault.py that will clean docs for you


[1/12/2024 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
how hard is making glob pattern work


[1/12/2024 1:56 PM] rsulfuratus
for cleaning docs?


[1/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
for copying


[1/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. what I really want is to have Campaigns\Dunmar* ignored


[1/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
and then all those links are broken


[1/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
so the link code cleans them to raw text rather than broken links


[1/12/2024 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is basically a change in build_md_list to use a better glob pattern


[1/12/2024 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah 
# skip files that start with a dot or underscore; will eventually fix this to a true ignore list


[1/12/2024 1:57 PM] .deciusmus
the other change would be a flag to only copy rooted: true


[1/12/2024 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
that is much easier since i already parse the metadata


[1/12/2024 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
but risks creating broken links


[1/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
I'd write it by reading the source file during build_md_list


[1/12/2024 1:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
sure, you read the files twice, but it seems like for ~1500-2000 files that should be ok


[1/12/2024 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
because then you don't have broken links


[1/12/2024 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, if you don't care about broken links there is no need to do anything, mkdocs has very good glob pattern support


[1/12/2024 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
actually you wouldn't need to read the files twice if you just store text and frontmatter in md_files


[1/12/2024 1:59 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/12/2024 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
for skipping campaign/dunmar


[1/12/2024 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
What I mean is that if I had the rooted: true feature I could:
1. only copy rooted: true
2. there are a handful of session notes that get rooted, so they would be copied, but 99% of the dunmar stuff would not be copied
3. use an mkdocs glob pattern to exclude Campaign\Dunmar from the final website


[1/12/2024 2:01 PM] .deciusmus
You'd end up with like 3 pages that have broken links to session notes


[1/12/2024 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/12/2024 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
if it really annoyed me I could manually fix those rooted: true pages.


[1/12/2024 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i am adding the skip on rooted right now

{Reactions}
👍

[1/12/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
the other feature that would not be a full glob but would actually be just as good is just a "my campaign path" setting, which, if set, would mean that nothing from Campaigns\ is copied unless it is
* Mechanics
* the my campaign path folder


[1/12/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
my current mkdocs glob is


[1/12/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
exclude_docs: |
  Campaigns/*
  !Campaigns/Cleenseau*
  !Campaigns/Mechanics
  !Campaigns/Player's Guide.md


[1/12/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
but moving the plaguelands and one shots files to their own folder and just special casing Campaigns is just as good as that


[1/12/2024 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
a feature to exclude ~xxx~ files would be nice as well


[1/12/2024 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
just to clarify, the rooted stuff works by setting frontmatter `rooted: True` if the page is reached, so the correct behavior is to only copy files where rooted is True


[1/12/2024 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
?


[1/12/2024 2:08 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/12/2024 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
the submodule doesn't have fantasy calendar


[1/12/2024 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
do you always just type a date?


[1/12/2024 2:11 PM] .deciusmus
nor plugins, which is more annoying


[1/12/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
for export, yes. it also makes the export noticably faster


[1/12/2024 2:11 PM] .deciusmus
I think I fixed that bug btw


[1/12/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[1/12/2024 2:11 PM] .deciusmus
the fantasy calendar "get current date" code is (a) slow and (b) has a nasty memory leak


[1/12/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
I was running through 4GB of memory trying to export everything and obsidian would cras


[1/12/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
Now the export reads the date once from fantasy calendar and then stores it, rather than for each file


[1/12/2024 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
but for the submodule you just need to copy your .obsidian directory to the location of the submodule


[1/12/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I know


[1/12/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
also need to copy main.md


[1/12/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
although given how the website side works, having a clee_index.md that is not gitignored is probably fine


[1/12/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
keep_only_rooted now should work


[1/12/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
there is also the option to copy a home page from templates/home.md


[1/12/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
(just remove the home_source if you don't want to do that


[1/12/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
right but no reason that can't be in obsidian right? the path could be taelgar\clee_main.md


[1/12/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/12/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
that will just rename it from taelgar\clee_main.md to taelgar\index.md


[1/12/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
right, which is exactly what I want


[1/12/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
i would slightly prefer if you keep the clee_main.md page in campaigns/cleeansau actually


[1/12/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
that was my plan, actually


[1/12/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that works well


[1/12/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
then you can set the home_source to whatever, and that file will get copied to taelgar/index.md before link cleanup happens


[1/12/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
does your code copy or move?


[1/12/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
copy


[1/12/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
that makes it a little bit more annoying to have it in campaigns because it will show up twice


[1/12/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
unless I change the rooting stuff to not set it rooted: true


[1/12/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
the reason for copy is that I want to build a nice home page with with a banner image and such


[1/12/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
which will probably need to be auto-built from a template


[1/12/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
right, copy makes sense


[1/12/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
oh, wait, it is gine


[1/12/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
*fine


[1/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
nothing links to it so I can glob it out via mkdocs exclude_docs


[1/12/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/12/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
btw i did a test build with setting the player's guide as the root and there are quite a lot of campaign things that get picked up


[1/12/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, the rooting stuff depends on the excludesRoot: [xxx] to be set judiciously


[1/12/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
there are lots of links from various random pages into the dunmari session notes


[1/12/2024 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
and once you get into the dunmari stuff, the links are so dense that you find 80% of it


[1/12/2024 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
I fixed it by setting excludeRoot: [clee] on the ~15 session notes that are the main entry points, plus a few key things like mirror, vidnistranja,


[1/12/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
it does seem like having a proper glob for building the md file list from the taelgar repo would be helpful then, though, as you could (mostly) not use excludesRoot then


[1/12/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
well, the problem is that i don't want the cross links


[1/12/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right but if the files aren't in the source files dict then the links now get removed


[1/12/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
but I'd still get a page for say, Alesh


[1/12/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
right i see


[1/12/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
I don't love the rooted stuff. Honestly a better strategy would probably be to just delete Campaigns first, then run the rooted checks


[1/12/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to update the campaigns directory so that only Players' Gide is in the root


[1/12/2024 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[1/12/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
also would ideally remove this line from Player's Guide:

For more information about character creation and game mechanics, please see the [[Character Creation Guide]].


[1/12/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
that seems more appriopriate in a campaign homepage, rather than a shared players guide, as we have different house rules


[1/12/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's fine to delete


[1/12/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is fairly simple to write a quick python script that would delete files from the source directory based on gitignore syntax


[1/12/2024 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so rather than manually deleting stuff, the build could be:
1. pull updates from taelgar repo
2. run prep_source.py
3. open repo, run prep_for_export
4. push / mkdocs serve


[1/12/2024 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/12/2024 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
that would be nicest


[1/12/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
because that solves (i think) all the rooted issues. Basically no need for excluding rooted because the dunmar or mawar stuff just auto-breaks chains


[1/12/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
I'm about to test


[1/12/2024 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
just added a prep_source_dir.py script to taelgarverse-v2


[1/12/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
it takes two positional arguments, first arg is a file in gitignore spec, second is a root dir

anything in the root dir that matches the gitignore spec will be deleted

`--dry-run` or `-n` does a dry run
`--verbose` or `-v` prints what it is deleting


[1/12/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
relies on the pathspec python module for parsing gitignore


[1/12/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
syntax


[1/12/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I assume this is robust but haven't tested


[1/12/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
it also never deletes .obsidian directories


[1/12/2024 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
still testing the last thing, chatgpt gave me code for this i'm not totally sure about


[1/12/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
I'm doing actual work ostly so slow going


[1/12/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
but I am checking whether rooted: true ends up pretty good having deleted the dunmar, etc dirs


[1/12/2024 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
you need a requirements.txt for your script


[1/12/2024 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah was going to add that to the main mkdocs repo so you can also install mkdocs and plugins but haven't yet


[1/12/2024 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
File "C:\Program Files\Python311\Lib\site-packages\slugify.py", line 24, in slugify
    unicode(
    ^^^^^^^


[1/12/2024 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
pip install python-slugify should get that


[1/12/2024 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
i installed slugify not python-slugify


[1/12/2024 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
this worked


[1/12/2024 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
lots of errors like

[1/12/2024 3:20 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i've been meaning to make that less verbose


[1/12/2024 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
but they exist


[1/12/2024 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm. this should be just using the exact parser from roamlinks...but let me check


[1/12/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
ah


[1/12/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
I can confirm the link stripping works! 🙂


[1/12/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
but I have 0 links


[1/12/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
there is one line in the build md where I used string parsing instead of pathlib to handle paths


[1/12/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
that is probably breaking on windows


[1/12/2024 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I fixed the place in my code where i relied on posix paths


[1/12/2024 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
was it this?
     # slugified full path
            slug = os.path.join(Path(*[slugify(part) for part in relative_path_parents]), slug_file_name)
            orig = os.path.join(file.relative_to(path).parent, file.name)


[1/12/2024 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
i changed those, didn't seem to fix it


[1/12/2024 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
no, not that


[1/12/2024 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
line above


[1/12/2024 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
where I split on "/"


[1/12/2024 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
relative_path_parents = str(file.relative_to(path).parent).split(os.path.sep)


[1/12/2024 3:31 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that


[1/12/2024 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
didn't fix it either


[1/12/2024 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
so it could also be that roamlinks uses "/"


[1/12/2024 3:33 PM] rsulfuratus
change `if '/' in filename:` to `if os.path.sep in filename`


[1/12/2024 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
because str(self.path_dict[filename]['file']) should be returning a "system native" path


[1/12/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
that fixed it


[1/12/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
but it isn't quite right because I loose the http checking


[1/12/2024 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/12/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
also still some case-sensitive issues, i.e. it can't find "elves"


[1/12/2024 3:35 PM] rsulfuratus
are you slugifying?


[1/12/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
no, I guess that would fix it


[1/12/2024 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah the file checking is not case-insensitive


[1/12/2024 3:36 PM] rsulfuratus
relies on files being slugified


[1/12/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't fix links in home.md


[1/12/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm, it did for me


[1/12/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
when copying from templates/home.md to taelgar/index.md


[1/12/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, didn't seem to


[1/12/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
it does that before building the source_files


[1/12/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
is the file being copied?


[1/12/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
I have something there; cannot 100% swear I didn't manually copy it in one of the attempts


[1/12/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to fix the JS statifcy to not break all the callout boxes and rerun everything


[1/12/2024 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
your prep script doesn't clean empty dirs. which is fine, but it is a bit confusing at first


[1/12/2024 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
that is an easy change if desired. but empty dirs shouldn't get recreated by the export vault code so i didn't think it mattered


[1/12/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
no, its fine


[1/12/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
I just thought my gitignore or your script was wrong at first


[1/12/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
because I glanced at the output and still saw the folders


[1/12/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, okay


[1/12/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
the index.md seems to have been linked correctly


[1/12/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
I might have been running an old version of your script

[1/12/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
but I don't know if I like the double callout


[1/12/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure I do either


[1/12/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a lot of whitespace to the right. probably what would look the best but might be annoying to set up is to have two callouts arranged side-by-side, one with biographical info and one with location, where if the viewport gets too narrow they stack instead

[1/12/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
it would be good to update your prep script to copy 

templates\assets\css to docs\assets\css
templates\assets\js to docs\assets\js


[1/12/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
custom css has to be inside docs


[1/12/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
is there any reason not just to copy templates/assets to docs/assets?


[1/12/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
no, that is probably better


[1/12/2024 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
actually better to copy templates\overrides to docs

[1/12/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
let me get something working first though


[1/12/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
actual ignore what I said


[1/12/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
pretty sure overrides is outside docs


[1/12/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
overrides replaces stuff; extras adds stuff


[1/12/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
but overrides can also add


[1/12/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah but i think it is probably easier to use extras, no?


[1/12/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
well, I was going to try to get backlinks to work


[1/12/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
there is a backlinks plugin but material doesn't support it out of the box


[1/12/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
working a bit on page titles, do you prefer "The Green Sea Region" (with article) for the sidebar nav or "Green Sea Region" (without article)?


[1/12/2024 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
I don't have a strong feeling


[1/12/2024 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed an update to export_vault.py that fills in the title attribute for every note, so that all pages will have properly displayed and cased titles regardless of slugification of file names or other quirks. a few details


[1/12/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
- i prefer yaml name to file name, so if there is a file with name: Robert but the file is Robert the Bandit, the nav link will be Robert not Robert the Bandit


[1/12/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
- i add title if it exists, so Nayan Karnas will be Samraat Nayan Karnas in the nav sidebar


[1/12/2024 5:08 PM] rsulfuratus
- i consistently title case file names, to correct for slugification


[1/12/2024 5:08 PM] rsulfuratus
- i have not yet added section links or cleaned up the folder names in the nav, which will require, i suspect, autogenerating a literate nav md file or something like that


[1/12/2024 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I believe (1) and (2) are consistent with the name manager behavior; the only thing I am not trying to do is add articles, which doesn't seem worthwhile


[1/12/2024 5:11 PM] .deciusmus
makes sense

that is pretty nice


[1/12/2024 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
it might be tricky to make it look nice with both 'busy' and 'nearly empty' whereabouts


[1/12/2024 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
although looking at that I can also see the logic of a wikipedia style box on the right


[1/12/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
The wikibox does not play that well with images


[1/12/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
I like the right aligned image inline with the text


[1/12/2024 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that's fair


[1/12/2024 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
hey btw can you look out your window and see if you see nathaniel on your swings?


[1/12/2024 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
he was planning on stopping by tonight


[1/12/2024 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
he would be leaving brown just about now


[1/12/2024 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
I did not see him


[1/12/2024 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
I also like the wiki-style box, but I don't see any good way to make it work, at least not easily, withut embedded the image in the frontmatter


[1/12/2024 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
whereas the above basically just works with the |right|300 stuff we discussed earlier


[1/12/2024 5:29 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to futz a bit more


[1/12/2024 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
finding a good place to put pronunciation would also be nice


[1/12/2024 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus

[1/12/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
the standard theme has tons of margin under the h1


[1/12/2024 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe just cutting that down would fix it


[1/12/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
but also I wonder if **Aygul** *(EYE-gool)*


[1/12/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
as H1 would work fine


[1/12/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
still might want to reduce margin


[1/12/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus

he is going to knock on our door when he is ready to leave so I can tell you. he said "a few more minutes"

having the location information separate makes it look a lot cleaner


[1/13/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm out and about most of the afternoon but I pushed an update to the literate_nav branch that:
1. correctly handles image alignment, width, height, and sets alt text
2. copies templates/toc.md (by default) to docs/toc.md, for use with literate nav. set "literate_nav" in website.json to "" or None to disable, or to a different file to use a different toc file. this assumes that you set toc.md as the literate nav nav file
3. hides toc by tag. by default this is just "person", if you want to hide toc in other tags, you can set "hide_toc_tags" : [ "person", "tag1", "tag2" ] in website json


[1/13/2024 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
the literate nav stuff isn't quite working and is a bit complicated, so i might investigate another option like awesome-pages


[1/13/2024 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed update that handles nested tags, so if you specify "item" in the hide_toc_tags you'll hide item/book, item/ring, etc, and also changed a few defaults


[1/13/2024 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
will fiddle more later today


[1/13/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a change to website export


[1/13/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
if you want to go back to the old way, change the prep-for-export temple to use "static" instead of "website"


[1/13/2024 3:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i have been fiddling with navigation, which is a bit complicated


[1/13/2024 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
the literate nav stuff is pretty buggy


[1/13/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
what do you care about for navigation? i have been working towards something that can work well with header nav items and can limit the items displayed on the nav without necessarily excluding them from search or direct url access or links


[1/13/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but this generally requires building a nav file that is distinct from the folder structure


[1/13/2024 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
I like the idea of header nav. Otherwise I haven't really thought about it


[1/13/2024 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
I like the option at least of just preserving the obisidian nav bu making folder notes work


[1/13/2024 3:10 PM] .deciusmus
I think my default would be something like

Top Level = Cleenseau | People | Gazetteer | Cosmology
And then each section copying the nav from obsidian plus folder notes
And then anything not in the nav still acessible via links


[1/13/2024 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that was basically what I was trying to get to work, with a few tweaks such as putting the species note as the folder note for each People subfolder and moving PCs/Dunmar Fellowship to Dunmar Campaign/Characters


[1/13/2024 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
the challenge it is it quite difficult to mix and match in that way without generating the full nav


[1/13/2024 3:12 PM] .deciusmus
Any thoughts on item pages?

[1/13/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
The Cleenseau / place version would probably work well as a default for everything

I decided to just auto-generate the complete nav file. it is based off a template file, basically just to handle directory globs better than literate nav does by default


[1/13/2024 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
autogenerated nav is working


[1/13/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
uses a template file like this:

    - [Characters](people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md)

anything without {glob: } is passed directly


[1/13/2024 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
does it handle folder notes correctly in some automatic way?


[1/13/2024 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
{glob: } is replaced with a recusrive list of all the files in the directory and subdirectories, with folder notes auto-placed if they exist, and excluding files in exclude (; delimited)

[1/13/2024 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
two existing bugs I might have time to fix tonight:
1. if a folder note is auto-placed, it is not automatically excluded. this should be east to fix, but right now e.g. [Eastern Green Sea] appears twice, once as the folder note and once in the listing


[1/13/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
2. not exactly a bug but enhancement, right now it uses ~ in title to delist ~Unnamed~ places but it is better to instead set unlisted: True in frontmatter, which then could be used to generate unlisted notes directly in obsidian


[1/13/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
I have the prep script that cleans my taelgar dir set to delete ~


[1/13/2024 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
that also works


[1/13/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
but unlisted: true would be nice as well


[1/13/2024 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
the more complicated improvement I'd like to implement is to be able to list multiple directories, and merge all the files into one nav unit, and/or alternatively to set a flatten attribute to get all files and subdirs but just sort the files themselves instead of the hierarchical nav


[1/13/2024 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but if you can live with the duplication bug it seems like it works pretty well at the moment, so you can play around with setting up your desired taelgar1720 nav


[1/13/2024 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
the {glob } syntax might be extended but i won't break existing templates


[1/13/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
note that if you want to set a folder page to a note that is not just folder-name.md, you have to set that manually, there is no way to auto-set those


[1/13/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so e.g. I have:
```
      - [Elves](species/children-of-the-embodied-gods/elves/elves.md)
          - {glob: people/elves/}
```


[1/13/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
in my template


[1/13/2024 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
and e.g.:
```
- [Dunmar Campaign](campaigns/dunmari-frontier/dunmari-frontier-campaign.md)
    - [Characters](people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/dunmar-fellowship.md)
        - {glob: people/pcs/dunmar-fellowship/, exclude: dunmar-fellowship.md}
```


[1/13/2024 7:28 PM] .deciusmus
is this in a branch or main?


[1/13/2024 7:28 PM] rsulfuratus
literate-nav branch


[1/13/2024 7:33 PM] rsulfuratus
just pushed an update that:
 - fixes the repeated folder name bug
- supports unlisted: frontmatter (by default set to true for files with ~ in the name)
- supports multiple directores in a glob, e.g. {glob: path/dir/first;path/dir/second}
- supports flatten keyword, e.g. {glob: path/dir;flatten}

the flatten keyword means: "find all md files recursively starting from dir and merge them into one list of files in the nav"

yeah, because it has no lines


[1/13/2024 7:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is good, but I think I'd still make it bold and not in parentheses


[1/13/2024 7:42 PM] .deciusmus
title case or lower case?

otherwise super nice


[1/13/2024 11:18 PM] .deciusmus
A few random thoughts before I go to bed:

* Rooting isn't a great model for what pages to include, as it ends up including way too much. The root logic picks up way too many random things and isn't guaranteed to pick up everything I care about (i.e. a new magic item the PCs just found isn't rooted, but some random page on a Dunmari is via Dunmar -> Tokra -> Order of Werewolf -> Govir or whatever)

* The nav works really well for constructing the nav, and can be used to "deemphasize" pages - it might be nice if the unlisted feature supported a per-campaign unlisting, if for example I wanted to unlist some specific pages. That said, I generally don't care about unlisting (see next point)

* What would really be useful is a better mechanism to manually control pages on a per-campaign basis in obsidian. For example, I might want to (a) have the nav not include any other places and (b) explicitly remove a handful of feywild pages where I want to make sure the information is discovered in game first


[1/13/2024 11:19 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, I think I'm like 90% of the way to the perfect site; actually it occurs to me glob patterns are pretty flexible; for the small number of pages I care about deleting I could probably just use filenames in the prep glob


[1/13/2024 11:20 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, I am going to bed. Haven't thought about actually publishing, but in the short term I might just run mkdocs build and copy and push to my existing github.io site


[1/14/2024 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
about to leave, but going to tackle the github actions to build the site today. also messing around with a nice homepage.

controlling page presence and page listing separately and on a per-campaign basis is probably the last challenge to tackle (aside from a few minor text cleanup things like fixing (DR:: ) tags). using globs in the prep script might be sufficient, but i'm going to mess around a bit with this later today

i think actually getting rid of rooted would simplify things a lot though, because then you don't need to run the prep script, you can just control what to copy to docs via a glob pattern + obsidian frontmatter directly. the only reason the prep script exists separately is because it is needed to delete files you want to exclude from the rooting calculations


[1/14/2024 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
i think probably this is the solution. gitignore globs are super powerful and also very easy to parse in python since there is a well-tested module to do this already. 

so you could have a "unlist" glob file and a "delete" glob file

alternatively or additionally you could have:
unlistPage: [campaign]
removePage: [campaign]
frontmatter, which could take 'all' as a special keyword to always unlist/remove


[1/14/2024 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus
i think that, plus getting rid of rooting, would allow the export_vault.py script to handle all file operations directly, and allow basically infinite customization of what you want to include/not include


[1/14/2024 10:15 AM] .deciusmus
As long as it runs before links are manipulated so you get correct unlinked stuff. 

But also separately I was going to look at making data view queries static as well. It could be worth having deleted prior to obsidian for that reason

further left and fix the title color, etc


[1/14/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
i've been messing around a bit, and I think that it is going to be easiest to set things up in the following way.

I am going to rename the taelgarverse-v2 to taelgarverse-site-generator. this is going to contain just the generator code.

the actual website will have submodules for the generator code and the main taelgar repo, plus templates.

the protocol will be:
1. git pull to update the taelgar repo in the website
2. run prep_for_export.py if you have need to delete files prior to obsidian staticification
3. run prep_for_export obsidian template
4. run export_vault.py (which will live in the taelgarverse-site-generator)
5. git push to push to website and let mkdocs autobuild via github actions

it is actually a lot easier to just have the export_vault code run prior to mkdocs build. this conceptually allows dumping literate nav and just writing the nav to mkdocs.yaml, which is a lot cleaner

it also makes the whole github actions workflow a lot simpler

to get leaflet to work, the ```leaflet``` block needs to be replaced with a (small) html/javascript block


[1/14/2024 7:03 PM] rsulfuratus
the home page is configurable from mkdocs.yml


[1/14/2024 7:03 PM] rsulfuratus
so you can change the buttons / title easily


[1/14/2024 7:03 PM] .deciusmus
It is actually possible to just do directly in obisidian, given we don' t have a ton of leaflet maps, but it might be nicer to have the python code strip leaflet and insert a replacement


[1/14/2024 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
that is easy


[1/14/2024 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
still am going to replace (DR:: ) too


[1/14/2024 7:04 PM] .deciusmus
basically, given this:

```leaflet 
id: region-map-sembara
image: [[[sembara-regions.png]]] 
bounds: 
- [0,0]
- [2468, 2308]
height: 900px
lat: 1200
long: 1200
minZoom: -1
maxZoom: 3
defaultZoom: 0
unit: miles 
scale: 0.5
```


[1/14/2024 7:05 PM] .deciusmus
you need to create this:

```
<div id="map"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {

            var map = L.map('map', {
                crs: L.CRS.Simple,
                minZoom: {minZoom},
                maxZoom: {maxZoom}
            });

            
            var bounds = [{bounds}[0], {bounds}[1];
            var image = L.imageOverlay('{fileLink}', bounds).addTo(map);
            map.setView( [{lat}, {long}], {defaultZoom});
        })
</script>
```


[1/14/2024 7:07 PM] .deciusmus
it would probably be best to have a template/leaflet.html where you just replace everything in {{x}} with the yaml element from the leaflet block


[1/14/2024 7:07 PM] .deciusmus
then I can tweak the html more easily


[1/14/2024 7:07 PM] rsulfuratus
what do you replace specifically? just "leaflet"


[1/14/2024 7:07 PM] .deciusmus
the entire leaflet code block


[1/14/2024 7:08 PM] .deciusmus

[1/14/2024 7:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but where does the image link live then?


[1/14/2024 7:08 PM] .deciusmus
you pull it


[1/14/2024 7:08 PM] .deciusmus
so the leaflet code block is a yaml file


[1/14/2024 7:08 PM] .deciusmus
you need to read the code block as yaml


[1/14/2024 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
then the html template I give you has {{image}} i.e which gets replaced with the image


[1/14/2024 7:09 PM] rsulfuratus
a perfect


[1/14/2024 7:09 PM] rsulfuratus
we are about to have dinner but i will mess around a bit later


[1/14/2024 7:37 PM] rsulfuratus
if you just use single `{` and `}` in the template it is really trivial to do this in python, so e.g. `{image}`


[1/14/2024 7:37 PM] .deciusmus
ok


[1/14/2024 7:37 PM] .deciusmus
can do


[1/14/2024 7:37 PM] .deciusmus
just trying to clean up a bit


[1/14/2024 7:37 PM] .deciusmus
will push in a few min


[1/14/2024 7:40 PM] rsulfuratus
for the taelgarverse-site-generator, my basic idea is that site-resources are files that get copied to specific locations, and templates are used for auto-generation


[1/14/2024 7:40 PM] rsulfuratus
fyi


[1/14/2024 7:40 PM] rsulfuratus
will work out the full build procedure and update readme later, need to figure out the github actions step


[1/14/2024 7:46 PM] .deciusmus
Ok, I pushed


[1/14/2024 7:46 PM] .deciusmus
template/leaflet.html


[1/14/2024 7:46 PM] rsulfuratus
to which repo?


[1/14/2024 7:46 PM] .deciusmus
some subtle notes in the comments


[1/14/2024 7:46 PM] .deciusmus
mine


[1/14/2024 7:46 PM] .deciusmus
my fork of yours, rather


[1/14/2024 7:46 PM] .deciusmus
msackton/taelgarverse1720-2


[1/14/2024 7:47 PM] .deciusmus
I guess with your new approach it makes sense to share a repo for site generation


[1/14/2024 7:48 PM] .deciusmus
Important bits:

1. I added a leaflet.css, you need to add to css extras in mkdoc
2. the actual leaflet code is pulled from a CDN, so you don't need any JS. You will see a script tag on the leaflet.html
3. A few key things in the comments, i.e. I could only get it to work with /assets/world-map.png instead of ../assets


[1/14/2024 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i added you to the taelgarverse-site-generator repo


[1/14/2024 7:49 PM] rsulfuratus
we are taking down our tree but in a bit i'll incorporate this


[1/14/2024 7:53 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure I understand how I'd use the taelgar-site-generator. I think you need to split some stuff into taelgarverse or it gets hard to share. I don't want the same toc as you, for example, so I either need a fork or the toc can't be in the site-gen repo


[1/14/2024 7:54 PM] .deciusmus
whereas some of the CSS does need to be, i.e. the CSS for leaflet


[1/14/2024 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
The idea is you’d have your own toc in your website repo


[1/14/2024 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
Just things aren’t properly organized yet


[1/14/2024 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
Site generator is for css, shared templates, code


[1/14/2024 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
toc, mkdocs.yml, etc is in website


[1/14/2024 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
right that makes sense it just wasn't organized that way so it was hard to visualize


[1/14/2024 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
cleaned up export_vault.py. it now manages all files that live in the docs directory (so, the main md files, the home page, the literate navigation file, stylesheets, and site images like the banner)


[1/14/2024 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
the source and destination of all these things can be set in the website.json config


[1/14/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example you will want to set your nav and home to your own files, while the stylesheets and site images might make sense to have shared


[1/14/2024 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
note that the home is copied inks are checked/upated, but the nav is generated after (this is the same as previous behavior)


[1/14/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
overrides are not managed by the script - you'll need to copy these manually from taelgarverse-website-generator to the appropriate directory in your website repo


[1/14/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
stil to do for me:
1. write code to replace (DR:: ) with actual dates
2. write code to replace leaflet code blocks with leaflet code and make sure that any necessary files are properly managed by export_vault.py
3. set up github actions

there are also a few display things i may fiddle with, for example with backlinks living in the toc nav we don't want to hide the toc nav for people/items, so there are a few tweaks to that


[1/14/2024 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i may also fiddle a bit with the color scheme (which is currently lifted entirely from my work page)


[1/14/2024 9:18 PM] rsulfuratus
might not get to this all tonight, we'll see


[1/14/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
changed hide_toc behavior so that hide_toc_tags option only hides the toc itself. there is also a hide_backlinks yaml option, controlled by hide_backlinks_tags in website.json. the right side nav is only removed if both hide_toc and hide_backlinks are true for a page


[1/14/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
if i do anything else tonight it will be late


[1/14/2024 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
I think backlinks on people are nicer on the bottom of the page. Not totally sure though


[1/14/2024 9:59 PM] .deciusmus
I almost have static dataviewjs logic working


[1/14/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
Ie replacing code blocks with the dataviewjs output


[1/15/2024 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
did a bunch more work on website - live now although some things to clean up still: https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/


[1/15/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
leaflet, backlinks, home page all set up and working. a bunch of new options in the config as well, see readme: https://github.com/tsackton/taelgarverse-site-generator/

[1/15/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
I still want to implement a ruler, full screen mode, and tiles in leaflet maps but that is going to be a longer-term project


[1/15/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
i also want to handle images a bit better (there is no reason for them to be quite so big for the website and it makes pages load slowly), but also might not tackle that today


[1/15/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
there are two bugs:
1. when there is just a backlinks on the right nav, the spacing between "Backlinks" and the first entry is weird, this is probably some css thing in the toc.html or something
2. there is a bug with the prep for export that sometimes generates a blank card - marcella is an example. maybe has to do with unknown current location


[1/15/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
the backlinks don't actually work onthe live website either


[1/15/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
because they don't prefix with taelgarverse


[1/15/2024 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
right i meant to fix that in toc.html but wanted to do it via config option so that we could use the same toc.html


[1/15/2024 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
pushed a fix for the marcella bug


[1/15/2024 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
did you grab my utf8 fix in export_vault.py btw?


[1/15/2024 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2024 11:20 AM] .deciusmus
So if I wanted to finish up my version, fastest approach would be to fork your taelgarverse repo and then much around, right?


[1/15/2024 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/15/2024 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus
although you need to make sure you get the submodules when you fork


[1/15/2024 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus
or you can just make a bare repo and add taelgar and taelgarverse-site-generator as submodules


[1/15/2024 11:22 AM] rsulfuratus
only thing you actually need from my website repo is the requirements.txt and the github actions


[1/15/2024 11:22 AM] rsulfuratus
everything else you can copy from taelgarverse-site-generator and edit as desired


[1/15/2024 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
the one other thing i am likely to do now is fix up image processing to automatically downsample any image that doesn't match `*map*` or `*region*`


[1/15/2024 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
remind me the syntax for pip to process  a requirements .txt


[1/15/2024 11:27 AM] rsulfuratus
pip install -r requirements.txt


[1/15/2024 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
is the literate nav dest relative to docs?


[1/15/2024 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2024 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
all the dest are relative to docs


[1/15/2024 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
so I can have a toc.md in the root


[1/15/2024 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is how i have it set up. it doesn't get listed anywhere. you'll want to make sure that it is ignored in backlinks - look at mkdocs_example.yml


[1/15/2024 11:54 AM] .deciusmus
Your leaflet code doesn't handle windows paths


[1/15/2024 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
arg yes i keep using replace('\'', "") instead of os.path.separator


[1/15/2024 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
it is this line


[1/15/2024 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
image_file_name = str(template_content["image"][0]).replace("[", "").replace("]", "").replace('\'', "")


[1/15/2024 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
`image_file_name = str(template_content["image"][0]).replace("[", "").replace("]", "").replace('\'', "")`


[1/15/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
oh wait actually nvm


[1/15/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
that is not the problem


[1/15/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
what does the output look like for a leaflet block?


[1/15/2024 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
/assets\map-2024-01-02.png


[1/15/2024 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
but it needs to be
/assets/map-2024-01-02.png


[1/15/2024 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
I think because the incoming string is the md-link, which is file-style, so on windows has \


[1/15/2024 11:57 AM] .deciusmus
the fix is, I would guess .replace("/", "\")


[1/15/2024 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
will try in a minute


[1/15/2024 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
wait do all your paths end up with \ when you convert wikilinks?


[1/15/2024 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/15/2024 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
ah hmm that isn't going to work for the website


[1/15/2024 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
there must be a way to change this in pathlib


[1/15/2024 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
hold on


[1/15/2024 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
mkdocs converts to real paths


[1/15/2024 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[1/15/2024 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
I mean http paths


[1/15/2024 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
mkdocs is smart enough to handle the md link with file paths to -> html A tag with proper paths no problem


[1/15/2024 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
it


[1/15/2024 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
the leaflet code is the only place (I think) where your python code is doing the conversion itself


[1/15/2024 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/15/2024 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
this should be the fix: `template_content["image"] = abs_path_root + str(page_path.as_posix())`


[1/15/2024 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
abs_apath_root is not defined


[1/15/2024 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
just change that to "/"


[1/15/2024 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
already did


[1/15/2024 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
or pull the new version


[1/15/2024 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
but working on image resize now


[1/15/2024 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so a bit in flight


[1/15/2024 12:02 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not totally convinced image resize is worthwhile


[1/15/2024 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
what are you resizing images to?


[1/15/2024 12:03 PM] rsulfuratus
longest dimension 1600 pixels


[1/15/2024 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
the current repo is 850 Mb


[1/15/2024 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
mostly in images


[1/15/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't want to run into github repo size limits


[1/15/2024 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
that's fair


[1/15/2024 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
most of these would be better resized in the obisidian side though right?


[1/15/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
well, i have mixed feelings. i sometimes go back and edit things (like use photoshop to fix eyes in early version midjourney)


[1/15/2024 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
for that having the full size image is crucial


[1/15/2024 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
so resizing for the website only is a bit of a compromise


[1/15/2024 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
if the obsidian repo gets too big due to images, then might reconsider, or keep full size versions outside my vault or something


[1/15/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I just looked I don't think I have any images > 1600, except for a few maps


[1/15/2024 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
so I don't really care what you do as long as it excludes -region


[1/15/2024 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
or -map


[1/15/2024 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
it might be worth having something like *fullsize* as well


[1/15/2024 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
* fullsize *


[1/15/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. exclude resize on

```
*map*
*region*
*fullsize*
```


[1/15/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
so if anyone wants a big picture for some reason, it is easy to do


[1/15/2024 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
resize saves about 200 Mb. not nothing but not amazing. probably cleaning up unlinked files would also help


[1/15/2024 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
that should be done in obsidian, though


[1/15/2024 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
pushed a fix for windows path issue in leaflet


[1/15/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
ok, let's see if it works


[1/15/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
resize images does make things much slower. you can disable by setting resize_images: false in the config json


[1/15/2024 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
are you using classic github pages or the actions version?


[1/15/2024 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
actions


[1/15/2024 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
much better

[1/15/2024 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
I did copy that, but it failed because it said pages wasnt enabled


[1/15/2024 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
into .github/actions in your website repo


[1/15/2024 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
right you still need to go to the pages setting and enable "Github Actions"


[1/15/2024 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
did you have to do any tweaking to get the page to actually work?


[1/15/2024 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
no


[1/15/2024 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
although maybe i broke something with script changes, just pushing an updated version to my repo to test


[1/15/2024 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
how did you get the /assets in the leaflet to have taelgarverse prepended?


[1/15/2024 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
and my navigation links are all to md files instead of real


[1/15/2024 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
you need the latest version of the script to make the leaflet work, then set abs_path_root to /website/ in json


[1/15/2024 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
also set base_path: /website/ in mkdocs.yml


[1/15/2024 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
plugins should be:
```
plugins:
  - search  
  - glightbox
  - callouts
  - mkdocs-backlinks:
      ignored_pages: [ 'Toc', 'Gazetteer', 'Home' ]
  - literate-nav:
      nav_file: toc.md
  - section-index
```


[1/15/2024 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
missing section-index is a possible explanation for the nav link issues


[1/15/2024 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
it is working locally; might have been old script or something


[1/15/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
will try again via gh-actions in a minute


[1/15/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
is there any reason for prep and export to be different, now that it is all just a script?


[1/15/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
I know I suggested might want it for static-dataviews, but I am not sure that is really worthwhile


[1/15/2024 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the export script has an ignore file now


[1/15/2024 12:39 PM] .deciusmus
ah, cool


[1/15/2024 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
files matching are not added to the master list, so don't get copied and can't be linked to


[1/15/2024 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
you can still use the export script if you care about deleting files prior to staticification, but you don't need to


[1/15/2024 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
also note the export script now deletes stubs by default, where stub = file with only newlines, headers or (stub) or stub


[1/15/2024 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
can be changed in the config if you want


[1/15/2024 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
headers meaning # right? so anything with a generated header will appear


[1/15/2024 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
?


[1/15/2024 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
note that this counts codeblocks, so e.g. the 1500s.md page still gets passed through (though the codeblock is removed)


[1/15/2024 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah headers is just markdown #


[1/15/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
so e.g. 
```
---
yaml
---

# The Great War

(stub)

```


[1/15/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
that would get removed


[1/15/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/15/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
this is calculated *after* comments are stripped


[1/15/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so if you remember to enclose your codeblocks in %%^Campaign:None%% lines then notes with just codeblocks will also get stripped


[1/15/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/15/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
so e.g. you can have a page where the entire contents is contained within a date block and it will be automatically stripped from the website until that date passes in game


[1/15/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
(as long as it doesn't have a header)


[1/15/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but for e.g. letters, texts, notes


[1/15/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/15/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
huh, I could in theory update the header generation code to include a 
%%^Date:<year born>%%

block


[1/15/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
wrapping the entire page


[1/15/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would be a nice way to automatically strip pages that don't exist yet from website


[1/15/2024 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
it would even potentially be sensible to have something in frontmatter like activeYear: xxx
which represents a year that a page starts being "relevant"


[1/15/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
which can default to born, but also makes it easy to strip all the 2 and 3 year old dunmari


[1/15/2024 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah lots of possibilities


[1/15/2024 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
your glob-based nav generates backslashes on windows, which I think breaks navigation on github pages


[1/15/2024 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
need to drop in a few .as_posix() to the paths


[1/15/2024 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think on windows either direction works


[1/15/2024 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
but on linux, it has to be /


[1/15/2024 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right as_posix forces /


[1/15/2024 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
which is fine on windows


[1/15/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
at least, it seems like that is how literate nav works


[1/15/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
so if you generate the literate nav on windows and then use it on linux it seems to die


[1/15/2024 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
markdown_list.append(f"{indent}- [{title}]({index_file})") needs to be index_file.as_posix()


[1/15/2024 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
and
```markdown_list.append(f"{indent}- [{title}]({file_display_path})")```


[1/15/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
needs to be
```
markdown_list.append(f"{indent}- [{title}]({file_display_path.as_posix()})")
```


[1/15/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that should fix it


[1/15/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
non-globs are passed unchanged so you also need to make sure your paths all use /


[1/15/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i'll push a fix in a bit


[1/15/2024 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
where is the ignore path set?


[1/15/2024 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
I see


[1/15/2024 12:54 PM] .deciusmus
nevermind


[1/15/2024 1:09 PM] .deciusmus
Does the comment stripping work with nested blocks?


[1/15/2024 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
it should work the same way obsidian does


[1/15/2024 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
that is each comment is the smallest %%(text)%% block


[1/15/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. does

%%^Date:something%%

Some text
Some more text

%%^Campaign:Something%%
Something
%%^End%%

More text
%%^End%%

work?


[1/15/2024 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
ah you mean the campaign stuff


[1/15/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I was going to add the active-year stuff


[1/15/2024 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
but wasn't sure if it would work for pages with emedded other things


[1/15/2024 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
it will work for embedded campaign


[1/15/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
because campaign stripping happens first


[1/15/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
and it takes the smallest text between %%Campaign%% and %%End%%


[1/15/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but if you have nested %%date%% blocks it won't work


[1/15/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually if the goal is just to remove pages that don't exist, no reason not to just do that directly with metadata in python


[1/15/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
much easier than handling nested comments


[1/15/2024 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
I was just going to only add the %%Date%% stuff if the file doesn't already have a date


[1/15/2024 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if there are no date matches in the file


[1/15/2024 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
that's fine, that should work


[1/15/2024 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
it will miss a few cases potentially, but Im not sure it matters


[1/15/2024 1:15 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is really easy to implement this in python, it is like 3 lines of code


[1/15/2024 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
as long as we never implement fancier date syntax, sure


[1/15/2024 1:16 PM] .deciusmus
but it breaks if say 
born: CY(5422) starts working


[1/15/2024 1:16 PM] .deciusmus
or something


[1/15/2024 1:18 PM] .deciusmus
honestly, it would be nicer to just have a 

excludePublish: [campaign, campaign, all]


[1/15/2024 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
which I assume is also easy, but ends up being more useful as I can do targeted excludes of things I dont want published


[1/15/2024 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/15/2024 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
i am trying to fix a few edge case parsing bugs now


[1/15/2024 1:20 PM] rsulfuratus
and delete unlinked images


[1/15/2024 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but can clean up the publish selection in a bit


[1/15/2024 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
are you still using the rooted logic?


[1/15/2024 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
no


[1/15/2024 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
i was going to delete from obsidian side as well

{Reactions}
👍

[1/15/2024 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed new version of script, fixes a few small bugs and adds option to remove unlinked images from site


[1/15/2024 1:44 PM] rsulfuratus
not well documented yet, look at the code where it reads in the website.json file


[1/15/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
still planning on:
1. clean up file selection by removing the rooted option, and instead parse an excludePublish list that will exclude a note from the website if either "campaign" or "all" is in the excludePublish list
2. double check display to make sure there are no other edge case bugs (let me know if you find any)
3. maybe change some of the colors


[1/15/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
then might fix up a bit of content then sending out the new link


[1/15/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
I have a change to the prep script that adds date exclude for any page that it is safe to do so and that either has a born/created/activeYear


[1/15/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
Any reason to make it configurable?


[1/15/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
I am also going to delete the rooted calculations


[1/15/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
i am a little nervous about nested comments, it will be easy to inadvertently break since it relies heavily on the order of operations in the python code


[1/15/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe it’s cleaner to set exclude publish automatically


[1/15/2024 1:50 PM] rsulfuratus
it is also easy to do this directly by parsing the frontmatter


[1/15/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
if we ever add date conversion to javascript, then the export code can just write activeYear in DR


[1/15/2024 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
That’s true


[1/15/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
It would actually be trivial for the obsidian to just set active year on all pages that don’t have it


[1/15/2024 1:52 PM] rsulfuratus
neither excludePublish or page exist parsing are implemented yet but i am going to do that this afternoon, about to head to do some errands so it won't be a for a bit


[1/15/2024 1:52 PM] rsulfuratus
it might be cleaner to have the export code set activeYear automatically if it doesn't exist, then python only has to look at activeYear and compare to export_date


[1/15/2024 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
just need to be a bit careful about the default, i guess should be 1-1-1 if there is no information about a real active year in the frontmatter


[1/15/2024 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
Can’t you just ignore it?


[1/15/2024 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
ah sure, yes, you can just set activeYear if it exists


[1/15/2024 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
Ie if null, don’t do anything?


[1/15/2024 1:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/15/2024 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
ok, I am pushing a change that will cause the website export in Obsidian to set activeYear if it is not set


[1/15/2024 2:07 PM] .deciusmus
It will currently always be a full year, equal to the year the person was born. If the element is set, it will not be overwritten

{Reactions}
👍

[1/15/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
did you push?


[1/15/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
oops, forget to push


[1/15/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
just did


[1/15/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
delete unlinked images is buggy for me btw


[1/15/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
it deleted 100% of my images


[1/15/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
except 2 heic images and some maps


[1/15/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
might also be a windows path issue


[1/15/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
let me look


[1/15/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
not used to developing cross platform


[1/15/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yup windows issue


[1/15/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
think i fixed it


[1/15/2024 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
I will try in a bit


[1/15/2024 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda want to get rid of fantasy calendar in the obsidian API. I keep having various issues with it, and it is annoying because it isn't apparently published anymore so for example if I add a plugin to the taelgarverse vault version it causes issues


[1/15/2024 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing it is used for is 
(a) tracking current date
(b) formatting month names for YYYY-MM dates
(c) formating the entire date for YYYY-MM-DD dates


[1/15/2024 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
I might rewrite to just use an in-house month name lookup and then format everything like

Month Day(suffix), Year


[1/15/2024 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
where suffix is 1st/2nd/3rd/4th/etc


[1/15/2024 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
tracking the moon is the only thing I use fantasy calendar for


[1/15/2024 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
plus current date


[1/15/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
did you add the .md-typeset to extra.css or is that from my lab website?


[1/15/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to clean up the css and get a better color scheme


[1/15/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
I added


[1/15/2024 3:24 PM] .deciusmus
that reduces the header margin, right?


[1/15/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
.md-typeset .ext-one-column {
  background: lightgray;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
}

.md-typeset .ext-narrow-margin {
  margin-top: 0.25rem;
  margin-bottom: 0.25rem;
}

.md-typeset h1 {
  margin-bottom: 0.15rem;
}


[1/15/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah for h1


[1/15/2024 3:24 PM] .deciusmus
oh, the light grey


[1/15/2024 3:24 PM] .deciusmus
that I added to offset the bio box


[1/15/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay, that defines the bio box color


[1/15/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
pushed a change, if there is a website.json the export dialog will default to the date there


[1/15/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
export seems to take much, much longer than before


[1/15/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
the rewrite frontmatter is, I think, slow


[1/15/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
I could optimize by skipping for pages that don't have activeyear/born/created


[1/15/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
honestly if it is just checking born/created in addition to activeyear it doesn't seem worth the extra time to run in javascript


[1/15/2024 3:53 PM] .deciusmus
the main reason to run in javascript is because I want to preserve future design space and don't want to have to revisit the python code


[1/15/2024 3:53 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a major perf fix


[1/15/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed some bugfixes. i am pretty sure the windows image thing was a different problem than i thought, but i tried a different approach to solve


[1/15/2024 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
I still haven't tried that yet


[1/15/2024 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
I am, for reasons that are not 100% clear,working on a run.py that will automatically do the obsidian export


[1/15/2024 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
it almost works


[1/15/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
conceivably that could allow you to just update the date on the website.json, push, and have the website autobuild entirely via github actions


[1/15/2024 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
still needs obsidian


[1/15/2024 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
it uses the obsidian URL syntax to open obsidian, run prep-for-export, and close obsidian


[1/15/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay that would be annoying to do in github vm


[1/15/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
or really probably impossible


[1/15/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
in theory you could do it, if you had a custom runner image or something that had obsidian installed


[1/15/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
but not really worthwhile


[1/15/2024 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus

pretty happy with this


[1/15/2024 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
Looks nice. I personally don't love the default blue color that is everywhere but it definitely looks good


[1/15/2024 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed an autobuild process, if you are interested


[1/15/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i am trying to change that but it is a bit tricky to figure out exactly what to change in the css

[1/15/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
FYI. I have an autobuild process working


[1/15/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Look at build.bat and run.py in my repo


[1/15/2024 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
It basically does the following:
* sync branch
*  copy a templater config file to your obsidian directory to make the prep-for-export run at startup
* launch obsidian via the URI scheme
* wait for obsidian to exit
* export py & commit


[1/15/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
If you define a templater "system command" that kills obsidian (you can see my windows example) obsidian will auto-exit at the end of the prep-for-export run


[1/15/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
The only user interaction is hitting enter inthe date box, which I left, because the code needs to wait for the obsidian index to finish building, if it needs to reindex

too much green on the map

if the map was totally normal by taelgarverse, maybe?

but the gradient is too strong


[1/15/2024 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i haven't figured out how to control the gradient

[1/15/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
looks nice


[1/15/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
It would be useful to split all your custom themeing from the site generator


[1/15/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
The extras.css on the site gen side should only be function stuff that is important for the site to look nice (i.e. the layout stuff)


[1/15/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
all the colors and things should really be in taelgarverse, because I don't necessary want to use your colors


[1/15/2024 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
The image stuff still isn't working on windows, but I don't really care enough to try to figure it out right now


[1/15/2024 10:14 PM] .deciusmus
I set excludePublish: ["all"] on a couple of obviously incomplete pages


[1/15/2024 10:54 PM] .deciusmus
I’m going to bed…

I pushed a change to allow excluding nav on pages via tags.


[1/15/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
If you get a chance to clean up the css let me know, at the moment my homepage looks kinda mess


[1/15/2024 11:44 PM] rsulfuratus
almost all the CSS is just for the home page, but i separated it out


[1/15/2024 11:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i also added in the home-informatics html and css, which is based on my lab site. doesn't support dark mode at the moment


[1/15/2024 11:48 PM] rsulfuratus
you just kind of have to fiddle a bunch for the homepage tbh


[1/15/2024 11:49 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm still not totally happen with mine, i'm not sure the gradient really works so i might go back to the darker overlay and white text


[1/15/2024 11:50 PM] rsulfuratus
you can also just change the css extras source to something local to you


[1/16/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
The point on CSS was just that I thought it would be valueable to have a distinction beween:
* CSS that all taelgar-verse websites should/must use so that something like leaflet will actully work
* CSS that you are using to style your website but that I don't care about


[1/16/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
(unless I want to copy your style)


[1/16/2024 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
doesn't matter to me if you put your stuff in the taelgarverse-site-generator because I can just ignore it, but I didn't want to ignore extras.css, and if I say, add ruler to leaflet and that requires some specific CSS to work, I want to add that to site-gen not msackton/taelgarverse1720


[1/16/2024 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
I assume BTW, you don't care about dufr/ tags.
In between meetings I am spending a little bit of time cleaning up people. Mostly, I don't love the 100s of people you made up showing up on my taelgarverse, so I am reviewing each one and adding excludePublish: clee as needed.
But separately, if there are minor metadata cleanups or status tag corrections I am also doing that


[1/16/2024 11:45 AM] rsulfuratus
no, don't care about the dufr tags


[1/16/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
other than the map container and the the biobox, all the css is currently only used for the homepage styling. 

there is some other grid styling that may be used later for e.g. arranging npc cards but right now is only used on the homepage - that is kind of the tricky bit. also the homepage css is, kind of annoyingly, split between the home.html and the extra.css

in any case i do want to clean this up - i got a much better sense of css when messing around with the homepage yesterday so i have a better understanding of what to clean


[1/16/2024 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
my ultimate plan is not to have css in home.html, which seems silly, but to have probably 4 css files:
- leaflet.css (move the map container here)
- taelgarverse.css (necessary page stylings, currently just used for summary boxes)
- grid.css (grid layouts stolen from my lab website, currently just used for home page but could be recycled elsewhere)
- homepage.css (homepage styling)

color outside the home page I am currently setting in the mkdocs.yml, but i would also put any site-wide color or format stuff not necessary for taelgarverse or leaflet into extra.css

there are still some quirks, though. for example the summary box light/ dark setting depends on the name of the theme you use for dark mode in the mkdocs.yml. so even the talegarverse.css might need to be tweaked on a site-by-site basis


[1/16/2024 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
You can have muliple files targeting the same element


[1/16/2024 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
The summary color should really be outside the taelgarverse.css entirely


[1/16/2024 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
taelgarverse.css should really just contain layout stuff


[1/16/2024 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
right, sure, you could remove the colors from .md-typeset .ext-one-column in taelgarverse.css and then only target the color in extra.css or something


[1/16/2024 11:58 AM] rsulfuratus
honestly it might be cleaner to use css ids for things like the summary box because it gets quite annoying figuring out what .md-typeset .ext-one-column is actually targetting and as I understand it, there is no reason autogenerated css elements can't just be tagged with an id, although maybe there are order-of-operations issues with multiple css targeted the same element and deciding which property is applied


[1/16/2024 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
well, it should have multiple classes, i.e. ext-one-column and also ext-summary-box


[1/16/2024 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
or perhaps just ext-summary-box, depending


[1/16/2024 12:00 PM] .deciusmus
totally separate topic, if you added dates to all the session note metadata (perhaps not worth while), it would be pretty easy to auto-link the date in a party met line to the session note where it happened


[1/16/2024 12:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Refactoring session notes has been on my list for a long time. But lots of sessions cover many days so I haven’t settled on exactly best way to handle that


[1/16/2024 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
probably just DR: and DR_end


[1/16/2024 12:02 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah makes sense


[1/16/2024 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. I was cleaning up a note (Galen) who had some line about the party attending a lecture of his. In the interest of making the note less campaign specific, I changed to a campaign line, and manually udpated to do this:

 %%^Campaign:DuFr%% The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] attended his lecture on [[Session 49 (DuFr)|August 22th, 1748]] in [[Chardon]], the [[Chardonian Empire]] %%^End%%

(Because the text I was deleting was something like "The party attended a lecture of his in Session 49")


[1/16/2024 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
And it comes across pretty nicely, but you have to do:
- { campaign: DuFr, type: attended his lecture, date: 1748-08-22, format: "<person:u> <met:s> on [[Session 49 (DuFr)|<target>]] <current:3rq>" }


[1/16/2024 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
although it would be cool to autolink, the real bottleneck is converting session note narratives into "party interaction" lines. but actually i bet chatgpt would be quite good at that, as long as there was a comment in the markdown indicating the start of each day or something


[1/16/2024 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
well, there are lots of existing interaction lines, is the thing


[1/16/2024 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, it is a bottleneck at some level, but plenty of manual cleanup does happen


[1/16/2024 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah autolinking would be great for that of course


[1/16/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
My real goal is to get references to session notes out of the main body of the text as much as possible, especially for pages that are relevant to my campaign (i.e. interesting or important NPCs in the western green sea region, especially)


[1/16/2024 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so, i've fiddling with this a bit. it is fairly easy to get session note references and party interactions into campaign blocks and that works well. but there is still the issue of the time perspective, e.g. for a lot of tollen people, if your party goes to tollen in 1730, they would be around but might be doing different things


[1/16/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I've been using date blocks for events. But some of it doesn't work super well no matter what.


[1/16/2024 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
and a few people have "life narratives" that then gets even more complicated - it is a lot of work to wrap each paragraph in a relevant date block


[1/16/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/16/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
I've mostly been using excludePublish


[1/16/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
or active year


[1/16/2024 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
i was actually wondering if setting activeyear might be better


[1/16/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
it isn't always clear what the right active year is though


[1/16/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i think you could treat active year as meaning:
the description in this note is probably roughly accurate starting from this year. it might be accurate before that year, but no guarantees


[1/16/2024 12:18 PM] .deciusmus
right, and sometimes that is clear from note context. But sometimes it isnt


[1/16/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and then just use comments to distinguish between "in game" and "proposed"


[1/16/2024 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. take Sura or Vahaiya


[1/16/2024 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
right, i guess i'm saying i don't really care if you set "active year" on sura to 1748


[1/16/2024 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/16/2024 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
if your party ever goes to dunmar and meets a young pre-mirror sura, then it is worth the effort to wrap the pre- and post-mirror history in date blocks


[1/16/2024 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/16/2024 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
so active year is not a canon thing, it is a 'this person hasn't interacted with players before this year' thing


[1/16/2024 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
I guess active year is better than exclude published where the note has sufficient context to guess a reasonable active year


[1/16/2024 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
but for someone like Vahaiya, I'd be inclined to just change the note so the one line about settling in Orenlas is wrapped in a date block


[1/16/2024 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
right, for npcs that have interacted with players in multiple campaigns that the best option for sure


[1/16/2024 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
and for a page like Herasto (a random centaur with no date info at all), I've just been setting excludePublish rather than trying to decipher a meaningful date


[1/16/2024 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that works, although i might suggest that it would be preferred to just set active year 1747 for those


[1/16/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
a good default active year for anything i made up with no context is 1747, as the great library campaign began early 1747 so nothing is from prior to that date


[1/16/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
although it doesn't really matter either way tbh


[1/16/2024 12:39 PM] .deciusmus
I've done like 2 pages. I can switch to active year instead and reserve exclude for things that are clearly active in the 1720s but that I dont want to publish for some reason


[1/16/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
Although I'm leaving excludePublish for :
* PC pages
* things I'd never want (i.e. Ladder or Taster)
* mystical/magic/unusual creatures who were almost certainly in fact active much earlier than 1747 but who I dont want to publish


[1/16/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that makes sense


[1/16/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
(i.e. fey who I want to skip, I wouldn't want to set "active year" on Agata to 1745, although I may decide to skip publishing her page)


[1/16/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/16/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
btw chatgpt by itself can't quite put the whole thing together, but this is a perfect use case for the open ai api.


[1/16/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
if you cut out the context around a person, chatgpt does a great job summarizing the interaction in 2-5 words that make sense in the context: party {interaction} npc


[1/16/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but it can't quite search through a markdown file, find all the people, and extract the context, and format it


[1/16/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but that is easy to do. you could even just build a list of all npc pages and use that to find npc names in text


[1/16/2024 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
would not be that expensive because you really don't need that many tokens, probably just a few dollars to do all session notes


[1/16/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
do you want me to leave images on pages alone, or move them to top/right, or only move them if there is no description section?


[1/16/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i think if there is a description section, just set to right|320 and leave (but you can tag me and i can rewrite some of those)


[1/16/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
if no description definitely feel free to move


[1/16/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
eric has done a ton of coding with the open ai API


[1/16/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
totally feasible to autogenerate a bunch of text that way. probably could write a script that would auto-insert campaign info lines for every npc based on session notes.


[1/16/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
did you push updates? i have a few minutes but don't want to do cleanup on the same notes


[1/16/2024 2:21 PM] .deciusmus

Here's an interesting one: Arryn III, the king of Sembara in 1748, but a young boy and princeling of Tyrwingha in 1720


[1/16/2024 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
It would actually be generally useful to have a ^DateEnd:xxx which included a block of the date is less than the date


[1/16/2024 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i guess if the idea is to have two separate blocks of text, one for 1720 and one for 1748, you want to exclude the 1720 one. that is kind of a lot of work, though, and is it really more useful than campaign blocks?


[1/16/2024 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
if it isn't trivial campaign blocks do basically the same thing


[1/16/2024 3:19 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean it is trivial to code


[1/16/2024 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
just slightly more work to fix the campaign block if my game time-skips, for example


[1/16/2024 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
but  I dont even know if/how much time skip I will do


[1/16/2024 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
I was just thinking, if I am bothering to rewrite a page from the perspective of 1720, it seems nicer to do

%%^DateEnd:1725%%
some text
%%^End%%

%%^Date:1745%%
original text
%%^End%%

Then the exact same thing with Clee/DuFr


[1/16/2024 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I think for parsing it is easier to use %%^Date:1745e%% to mean "remove this text if export date is after date"


[1/16/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/16/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
The main use case I have for this would be a handful of Sembaran royals


[1/16/2024 3:24 PM] .deciusmus
But someone like Sura could be a use case as well, where (if it came up) it would be a lot simpler to write a "pre-mirror" short stub block


[1/16/2024 3:25 PM] .deciusmus
(i.e. then try to rewrite the whole long "post-mirror" article with various date blocks to get it to work correctly)


[1/16/2024 3:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm adding this now


[1/16/2024 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
since the code means "remove this block if current date is **a**fter date in block", let's use %%^Date:1745a%%


[1/16/2024 3:28 PM] .deciusmus
```
%%^Date:1721a%%
A young princeling of [[Tyrwingha]], he is a quite and mild-mannered child who is said to particularly love stories about his namesake, [[Arryn I]]. 
%%^End%%

%%^Date:1740%%
The king of Sembara in the 1740s, he is a quiet ruler and has largely maintained the peace and prosperity of his mother, [[Elaine II]]. He came to the throne in DR 1745 on her death. 
%%^End%%
```

[1/16/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
so you can set the format on the campaign info line, i.e. 

{ format = "<met:u> <person:q> on <target> <current:3Frq>" }


[1/16/2024 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
where person is the person/campaign, target is the date, current is the current location on the date, met is the met verb


[1/16/2024 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
but you shouldn't have to .. what is your whereabout line for the aboleth lair


[1/16/2024 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the aboleth lair doesn't have a page


[1/16/2024 4:25 PM] rsulfuratus
{type: away, start: 1748-10-08, end: 1748-10-14, location: the aboleth lair east of Vermillion Isles}


[1/16/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
right, there is actually a bug or subtle issue here


[1/16/2024 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
So basically...

1. you can set "linkText" in the line, i.e.
{type: away, start: 1748-10-08, end: 1748-10-14, location: the aboleth lair east of Vermillion Isles, linkText: from}


[1/16/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
right that is what I was trying to rememver


[1/16/2024 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
but 2. the linkText is ignored when the page doesn't exist, because we turn it into:
{type: away, start: 1748-10-08, end: 1748-10-14, location: Vermillion Isles, linkText: the aboleth lair east of }


[1/16/2024 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
You can either
(a) use an alias instead:
{type: away, start: 1748-10-08, end: 1748-10-14, location: Vermillion Isles, alias: the aboleth lair east of Vermillion Isles, linkText: from}


[1/16/2024 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is better to set it in the frontmatter, because if I ever made a page from the aboleth's lair, that is the only option where regenerating the header would produce the correct location link


[1/16/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
(b) set format on the campaign line:
- {campaign: dufr, person: Wellby, date: 1748-10-14, type: rescued by, format: "<met:u> <person:q> on <target> from <current:3Frq>"}


[1/16/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
the format on the campaign line is probaby the right option


[1/16/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
but the alias works better with location searches, i.e. a dataview query for everyone in the Vermillion Isles


[1/16/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
well sure but the aboleth lair isn't in the vermillion isles, it a day's sail east


[1/16/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
in that case, the format is almost certainly correct approach


[1/16/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
another question - how do the format lines work again in whereabouts? I am experimenting for fun with rewriting Umli's page to be date agnostic, but I want to put the length of time she's lived in Tollen in the header, if that is her home location


[1/16/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
ah actually I guess that is not possible since it uses dates from the tollen page, not the umli page


[1/16/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure I totally follow


[1/16/2024 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
are you trying to have something like

Based in Tollen (since 1733)


[1/16/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, or Based in Tollen (for 15 years)


[1/16/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
basically i deleted the sentence from the overview "Umli has been based in Tollen for the past 15 years" but wanted to see if it is possible to capture that information in the header


[1/16/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
you can almost do it with affiliations:

it doesn't really matter, was just seeing if it was possible


[1/16/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
you could do it with affiliations by overriding wHome and the affiliation display defaults but that would then mess things up at earlier dates, easier just to use the %% date blocks


[1/16/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
I would be fairly trivial to have the whereabouts formatting for home pass in the start/end

but can't you just put the format on the Tollen line?

only perhaps meaningless downside is that it means you can't access the person's *actual* age or born/died dates in a whereabouts line

obviously wouldn't do that for everyone but it is kind of a fun exercise. if your group goes to tollen in 1730, she isn't there and you just get the text about her being a metalworker and smith. in 1735, she is in tollen but not affiliated with university or the focus of rumors. by 1738 she is well known


[1/16/2024 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/16/2024 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
That type of page works well for an interesting minor character.


[1/16/2024 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
vahaiya would be a good page to write like this as that is actually more relevant


[1/16/2024 5:46 PM] rsulfuratus
do you think anything would break if we changed the formatter for random metadata to name instead of casing? 

use case is added a deity or similar tag to organize religions/mystery cults, etc, instead of using subtypeof.

e.g. this works fine but doesn't auto-link

for diety the the's are probably right

there is a very subtle bug in the affiliations manager, where when you get normalized affiliations, they always have a date set (it is never undefined), but this means that prefixes don't work properly and you get:

[1/16/2024 7:43 PM] rsulfuratus
i fixed it by adding:
```
if (value.isNormalizedDate && value.isHiddenDate) return ""
``` 
to the token parser but I don't know if there are other things this will break


[1/16/2024 8:15 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a ton of regenerated headers, fyi, not changing any information but just working towards getting rid of all the pages in "Old Header Version" (which produce callouts instead of summary boxes on website)


[1/16/2024 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
The token parser change is fine; but the actual bug is in getLeadBy


[1/16/2024 8:28 PM] .deciusmus
most things have a "no date/past/current" format string, lead by doesn't (it probably should, honestly). But even so, it shouldn't be passing a "bad" date along. But actually, token parser fix is fine


[1/16/2024 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
Your token casing change generates things like this

I will just do that


[1/16/2024 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
ah i see you are using metadata overrides to create a new metadata entry called affiliationtitle before passing to TokenParser. I was trying to figure out how you ended up getting affiliationtitle as a metadata entry

yeah

made a few tweaks to the campaign rules in export_vault to allow multiple target campaigns (e.g. if I want to do mc and dufr). should still work exactly as previous with only one campaign but let me know if you see bugs

[1/16/2024 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
excludePublish works on "all" so if any of the campaigns in your list are in the excludePublish list, the note is excluded

comment stripping works on "any" so if any of the campaigns in your list match, the content is passed along

We don't have a good way to track NPCs who the party just knows, i.e. in my game there are a bunch of "important" NPCs who the party meets almost every day. Tracking via "campaign info" is a bit wrong, but it is kinda nice to have the ability to flag "known to party" vs not

this was the idea behind my tag system, but it is a bit of a pain to maintain. i have been thinking about something autogenerated based on session note mentions but that only works with detailed session notes


[1/17/2024 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
I am taking a little break from work to do some taelgar stuff during lunch, I have been thinking about the highland kingdoms and trying to write something up. 

Do you have any sense about how far east into Vostok the “highland culture” goes? Or about what the northern Vos are like?


[1/17/2024 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yes I do have a sense of this. in a meeting now though


[1/17/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
so basic outline - open to revision
- northerners cross mountains pre-downfall, up north, kind of around where blackwater fens is now, into the plains that are now kenku homeland
- they slowly spread out, trickling across the forests of inland sembara, vos, and further east, basically sticking to the forests/highlands
- in the coasts/lowlands/river valleys mix with mariners, creating a variety of cultures (lowland sembara, tyrwingha, skaer)
- lowland cultures (minus skaer) are more influenced by drankor than highland cultures
- so this gives you basically a band spreading all the way from sentinels to some unknown point east of "northerner" culture, with some variations
- my main feeling is that three primary events drive variation among the northerners

1. initial spread: there is likely some variation in the initial spread, with different groups and traditions creating an initial baseline level of differentiation. mostly, i think the people who made it past the Sivnjo mountains are from a related but distinct cultural tradition that the people of Sembara/Vos

2. mariner interactions: the sembaran highlanders don't interact with mariners as much as the Vos

3. skaer interactions: the skaer have considerable influence in two time periods, first in the time after the downfall when the skaer are dominant in the western gulf and conquer tollen/establish an empire; second in the early sembaran period when skaer raid frequently on the coasts


[1/17/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in the current day this leads to:
- sembaran highland culture that stretches to the "lakes region" of eastern inland vos, largely uninfluenced by anyone 
- a lowlander vos culture with strong "northern" and "skaer" and "drankorian" influences, may be a mix of kestavo and mos numena, for example, but mostly restricted along the coasts, from say the volta east
- an "interior" vos culture, which was greatly influenced by the skaer empire when the skaer would raid/sail/conquer up the rivers, but probably shares a religion with highlanders (e.g. are kestavan)
- might also be room for others, e.g. the lowland vos may be geographically split between kestavan and mos numean traditions; the "wall culture" could be something yet again separate; an interior vos culture that largely fled the skaer expansion and has a more mariner offshoot but inland vibe (perhaps analogous a bit to britons vs anglo-saxons)


[1/17/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
but to answer your specific question, the highlander culture probably spreads into northeastern vostok in particular in the area around the lakes, but not much further


[1/17/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
Here's a rough map I drew:

Red = "Zimka" northern culture
Green = "mariner"
Blue = "Vos" northern culture (to the extent it is different from Zimka, could be the same)
Yellow = Lizardfolk swamp

[1/17/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
Undetermined is how humans got to Tyrwinha, map is not meant to implement it was lizardfolk


[1/17/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
i think when people settle, the vos and zimka cultures are not really distinct, and probably spread all the way south across mostreve hills and into tyrwingha


[1/17/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
this is pre-downfall, pre-mariner


[1/17/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
I thought we had a giant lizardfolk swamp ?


[1/17/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
sure but it doesn't reach all the way to the sentinels


[1/17/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
covers basically of the sembaran lowlands


[1/17/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
and tyrwingha


[1/17/2024 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway the point isn't about tyrwingha


[1/17/2024 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
point is that i think at the initial migration of northern cultures from the east over the mountains, you really get two (for now) cultural strands


[1/17/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
So maybe more like this (pre-mariner)

[1/17/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
basically the logic being three variants of "northern folk religions" feels like a good initial number


[1/17/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
blue = "vos"
red = "zimka"
yellow = lizardfolk
green = elves


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
swamp goes further north, as far as the volta at least


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
actually had the idea at one point that the western gulf didn't even exist pre-downfall, or was much smaller


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
tbd when you go explore the canyon with the portal to the plane of water down there


[1/17/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
Doesn't Tollen predate the downfall? I think the swamp probably goes to the Teft

[1/17/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure, maybe not quite to the volta


[1/17/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
but the details don't really matter


[1/17/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah anyway my point is you don't really have two distinct cultures that show up in vos/zimka


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
there is the zimka vs "east of Sivnjo" distinction where there might be different variants of the northern folk religions


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but the whole interior highlands are kestavan


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
ah, I see. So you want the blue and red to be the same


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
that makes sense


[1/17/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
at this point in history yes


[1/17/2024 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
then distinctions really arise from interactions with mariners, drankor, and skaer


[1/17/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
then you have something like this (fuschia = mariner culture)

[1/17/2024 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah the details of the history can be a little fuzzy but the idea is you have the zimka who basically remain pretty isolated and self-contained throughout their history, and then vos being a bit more of a mixing ground


[1/17/2024 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
then you end up with something broadly like this:

[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
where fuschia - zimka, more isolated, esp by drankor (red)


[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
green - skaer


[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] .deciusmus
blue = what becomes vos


[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[1/17/2024 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
vos ends up with at least three dominant cultures, although room for more


[1/17/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
a lowland vos culture that is dominant in the lower river valleys and coast that might even be mos numenan (tbd)


[1/17/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
a highland vos culture that is dominant in the northeast of the country that is mariner influenced and skaer influenced but less drankor


[1/17/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
the zimka culture in the volta headwaters and east across the "lakes region"


[1/17/2024 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but I don't know that the Zimka culture is "part of Vostok"


[1/17/2024 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Vostok is kind of an artfact of drankorian mapmakers and sembaran nationalists, though


[1/17/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
like, maybe isn't a real place from the point of view of the vos


[1/17/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
The reason for all this is to better establish the "highland" kingdoms -- and I'm leaning toward the idea that there are three actual kingdoms (Ardlas, Lavnoch, Breva) and then northern Zimkovia or Zimkovia or whatever it is called, which stretches in most of the fuschia region


[1/17/2024 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
so I think the idea is drankor draws a line along the volta and calls everything beyond it the land of the vos, not particularly caring that this creates a line right through "zimka" territory


[1/17/2024 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
when Derik III claims overlordship of Vostok during the wars against Vimfrost, perhaps this is kind of a polite legal fiction in a sense, and it is largely the lowland vos who actually acknowledge his rule in some vague sense. but the people who are actually getting slaughtered by the dragon's armies aren't about to turn down help


[1/17/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
from the point of view of the Vos, the lines would be drawn differently perhaps


[1/17/2024 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
I just don't entirely envision the Zimka (or the Vos) has having borders on a map and clear political units. Like, there is no particular "kingdom" of Zimkovia that anyone could conqueor and the people wouldn't really have the sense of a common nation


[1/17/2024 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah exactly


[1/17/2024 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
vostok is the same way, it is just the part of the world that drankorian mapmakers labeled "the land of the Vos"

[1/17/2024 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
Basically the pink is the area that is populated by the Zimka people (whereas the red are various Zimka-adajenct kingdoms that might speak the Zimka language but are in fact organized in some type of reconigizable political units)


[1/17/2024 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
people in Sembara would call those the Highland Kingdoms or the Zimka Realms or whatever. Zimkovia is the name for the pink area = the land of the Zimka


[1/17/2024 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
the exact borders with Vostok fuzzy


[1/17/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
where Vostok, like Zimkovia, is a Drankorian fiction, not a real "kingdom"


[1/17/2024 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
I prefer Zimkova, instead of Zimkovia, if you don't care too much. Zimkovia sounds too much like Sokovia from the marvel movies to me


[1/17/2024 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
I am happy with either


[1/17/2024 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
One of the things I don't like is the current history of how the Zimka realms joined and then left Sembara - as per our earlier conversation, I think conquest for the typical human conquest reasons doesn't seem quite right.


[1/17/2024 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
Also the history I wrote a while ago has Derik III never being king of Zimkova, which I think is probably wrong here as well. I think he is in his person High King of Vostok and Zimkova, but his heirs don't maintain that for various reasons, most likely because it was basically always a legal fiction, embodied in Derik III's personal leadership, and the heirs are basically embarassed to claim the title when clearly they are never going to go to those places


[1/17/2024 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
I gotta go back to work for a bit but I might take a stab at rewriting some of the history later. I'll push it in a branch or brainstorming document or something


[1/17/2024 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
do you have names for this river or this lake?

these are my western cymea names:
Some rough details for local features:

**Vistalba** (Veess-tahl-bah) - the largest town in this area, a trading port with a decent harbor, once much richer; now has a kind of run-down, lost in the past feeling. harbor dates to Drankorian days, though. once a major port through with Cymea wine, silver, and other goods passed. 

**Castelluccio** (Cah-steh-loo-cho) - one of several small villages inland along the Serrania, scraping by on agriculture

**Vallegra** (Vah-yeh-grah) - another agricultural village

**Redes** (Reh-des) - a small fishing village on the coast, just south of Lunacosta

**Lunacosta** (Loo-nah-koh-stah) - a market town on the coast at the mouth of the Serrania River

==

**Plataca Hills** (*PLAH-tah-kah*) - the hills that begin as low foothills about 40 miles from the western gulf, and rise to a significant barrier to travel

**Serranía River** *(Seh-rrah-nee-ah)* - the rushing, rocky river that flows from the Plataca Hills to the Western Gulf. Only the first 10 miles or so are easily navigable.

I reorganized the taelgarverse css, btw. there are a few bugs i haven't figured out yet but once i sort it out i'll push. there are:
- leaflet.css for things needed for the maps
- taelgarverse.css for grids and margins
- homepage.css for home page banner classes
- styling.css which has all the color elements

plus
- home.html which is the template for the home page
- toc.html which adds backlinks


[1/17/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea being if you just want to change colors you can just edit styling.css; if you want to change the homepage layout you need to mess with homepage.css and/or the home.html template; and you shouldn't ever need to change talegarverse or leaflet except to add new stuff

all color settings are in styling.css; note that this assumes you've set color themes for light and dark mode in mkdocs.yml, and that you are using slate as the dark mode color theme.

My main idea is the Zimka are influenced by Pictish/Rus ideas about kingship (see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanistry or https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota_system)

Tanistry
Tanistry is a Gaelic system for passing on titles and lands.  In this system the Tanist (Irish: Tánaiste; Scottish Gaelic: Tànaiste; Manx: Tanishtey) is the office of heir-apparent, or second-in-command, among the (royal) Gaelic patrilineal dynasties of Ireland, Scotland and Mann, to succeed to the chieftainship or to the kingship.

[1/17/2024 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems like an issue with the exporter script not the css


[1/17/2024 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
the content of the files is just { .bio }


[1/17/2024 10:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is just user error but i'm checking


[1/17/2024 10:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i suspect that the export template ran before obsidian finished indexing or something


[1/17/2024 10:17 PM] rsulfuratus
something definitely seems broken, but not sure what

last time I can confirm the script worked to generate headers was Jan 15th


[1/17/2024 10:35 PM] .deciusmus
I can recreate; I can't figure out what changed though


[1/17/2024 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
The metadata.json file doesn't seem to be loaded correctly


[1/17/2024 10:38 PM] .deciusmus
Adding:

```
    const metadataFilePath = app.vault.configDir + "/metadata.json";
    let metadataFile = await app.vault.adapter.read(metadataFilePath);        
    customJS.state.coreMeta = JSON.parse(metadataFile)
 
```
to the top of async function regenerateHeader(tp, headerType)  seems to fix it


[1/17/2024 10:42 PM] .deciusmus
pushed a fix


[1/17/2024 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
I added a step to force load customJS in the prepForExport script, because I was running it as a startup script it sometimes it would start before customJS had loaded


[1/17/2024 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
that apparently clears the customJS state, so the loaded metadata was blank, so all the format strings were ""


[1/17/2024 10:43 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a fix

interesting... but waht's the goal? to backlink people?


[1/19/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the people thing is was just messing around to see if chatgpt could distinguish people and places


[1/19/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
the goal is to add tagline and summary to the markdown for each session note


[1/19/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
so you can auto-gen an index or something?


[1/19/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
for the taglines yes but mostly to literally update the markdown so I can automatically reformat the old session notes into the new format


[1/19/2024 2:41 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[1/19/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-2-dufr/

https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/campaigns/dunmari-frontier/session-notes/session-83-dufr/


[1/19/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
the people thing though might be useful for automatic campaign info generation, e.g. to get an "interaction" line for each NPC

btw, did you get my run.py thing working? on windows at least it seems to always run the taelgarverse export script before I exit obisidian

yes, I got it working. look in my taelgarverse repo


[1/19/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i needed to give obsidian time to start before hitting the while loop


[1/19/2024 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
add time.sleep(10) or time.sleep(20) as needed

before while, after subprocess.Popen

[1/19/2024 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
whether having hundreds of interaction lines is worthwhile is a different question, but that is pretty cool


[1/19/2024 3:21 PM] .deciusmus
what is the easiest way to change the homepage.css for my version?


[1/19/2024 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
what do you want to change?


[1/19/2024 3:22 PM] .deciusmus
set the height to 40vh instead of 70


[1/19/2024 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, you mean file management


[1/19/2024 3:22 PM] .deciusmus
right; I know the changes I want to make the css, I'm just not sure the easiest way to do it


[1/19/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
if I make an overrides/stylesheets/homepage.css will the export_vault overwrite it with yours?


[1/19/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
probably just set the css extras path in the website.json to something other than the taelgarverse-site-generator folder


[1/19/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
do I need to make a homepage_mike or something


[1/19/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
export_vault copies stylesheets and logos/site images to docs, doesn't touch overrides


[1/19/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
since docs is usually autodeleted you need to store them outside of docs somewhere


[1/19/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a path in the json


[1/19/2024 3:24 PM] .deciusmus
right ok, so in theory mkdoc will copy overrides to the same location and overwrite the version from export vault


[1/19/2024 3:24 PM] .deciusmus
right but I don't want to NOT copy the files from site-gen as I want everything else


[1/19/2024 3:25 PM] rsulfuratus
then you could just make homepage_mike.css and change your mkdocs.yml to replace homepage.css with homepage_mike.css


[1/19/2024 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
or you could just copy the css to a new directory in your taelgarverse1720 repo, and set that as the base for your website.json


[1/19/2024 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
you have to manually manage overrides, they are not touched by export_vault at all


[1/19/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
so you'll have to manually copy the new home.html and toc.html partials to the correct directories in your website repo


[1/19/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
right, but mkdocs copies overrides to docs during the build process


[1/19/2024 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
so the easiest thing to do is:
* add custom css to overrides\assets\stylesheets\homepage_custom.css
* change mkdocs.yaml to remove the stylesheets\homepage.css and add the assets\stylesheets\homepage_custom.css


[1/19/2024 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i am not using overrides css at all


[1/19/2024 3:34 PM] rsulfuratus
everything is in extra


[1/19/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
same thing


[1/19/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
extra_css: in the mkdocs yaml defines the CSS files to include in the built html as links


[1/19/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
overrides is just a file copy


[1/19/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
it replaces whatever files are in the "main" theme


[1/19/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
but it *adds* as well as replaces


[1/19/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
so if you have a CSS in overrides\assets\stylesheets, AND you add it to extra_css, it ends up being used


[1/19/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
OR alternatively, if wanted to completely replace something from the theme, you just need to have the same filename in overrides


[1/19/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
the way things are currently set up:
- export_vault.py copies everything in `css_extras_source` to `docs/css_extras_dest`, and also everything in `site_images_source` to `docs/site_images_dest`
- anything in `custom_dir: (dir name)` is not touched at all by export_vault.py


[1/19/2024 3:37 PM] .deciusmus
So conceptually, the right way to split this would be to move homepage.css and styling.css from taelgarverse-site-gen to your taelgarverse\overrides\assets\stylesheets and then change your mkdocs.yml


[1/19/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
but it doesn't super matter as it is easy enough to ignore the CSS files I don't want


[1/19/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't understand why that would be better


[1/19/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
also what would you change in the mkdocs?


[1/19/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
extra_css:
  - stylesheets/leaflet.css
  - stylesheets/taelgarverse.css
  - assets/stylesheets/homepage_custom.css
  - stylesheets/styling.css


[1/19/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
assets/stylesheets/homepage.css instead of stylesheets/homepage.css


[1/19/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
that is not how the mkdocs documents describe how to set up extra style sheets


[1/19/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
it is better just because it clarifies the split between "core taelgarvers" and "this instance of taelgarvers"


[1/19/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
```
extra_css:
  - stylesheets/leaflet.css
  - stylesheets/taelgarverse.css
  - assets/stylesheets/homepage_custom.css
  - stylesheets/styling.css
```


[1/19/2024 3:40 PM] .deciusmus
to be clear


[1/19/2024 3:40 PM] .deciusmus
the assets/stylesheets/homepage_custom.css is just because that is where the mkdocs build process copies the assets during site build


[1/19/2024 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
after I run mkdocs build I have this:

[1/19/2024 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
the mkdocs documentation is a bit confusing because it doesn't make clear you can mix extra_css and override_css to your heart's content


[1/19/2024 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
but you can, it is instrinic to the way override works


[1/19/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I also have this:

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1059870250440593520/1198004564134199417/image.png?ex=678b6971&is=678a17f1&hm=cf27b4a21202302c47460ff33565219a9b65ff4a52d96ad495bea31b31b113ae&


[1/19/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
you can, but the philosophy of the documentation is that overrides overrides something and css_extra adds something


[1/19/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
right but the override is useful for adding as well


[1/19/2024 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
there is no reason not to use override to cause something to be copied into the final output dir


[1/19/2024 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
in the "normal" case the mkdocs folks would basically say, don't bother. Why are you putting someting in overrides when you could instead just put it in docs\assets\stylesheets directly


[1/19/2024 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
but the point here is that because we are auto-generating docs\ and therefore deleting it before building it, we can't store anything in docs


[1/19/2024 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
so in theory you could invent yet-another-way to copy files from <somewhere> to docs\<somewhere> but overrides already does that for free, so it is a lot easier to do that than invent something else


[1/19/2024 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right so a perfectly fine build process would be to just use overrides and don't use the export_vault copy process at all


[1/19/2024 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
right but then you can't share stuff


[1/19/2024 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
see, I want to be able to distinguish between
(a) the stuff I want from taelgarverse-site-gen
(b) the stuff I don't want from taelgarverse-site-gen


[1/19/2024 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean you can copy whatever you want


[1/19/2024 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
Given it is reorganized by file, it is fairly meaningless, because I can copy everything and then use extra_css to control what I __se__


[1/19/2024 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
use


[1/19/2024 3:45 PM] rsulfuratus
there is no reason to use an automated copy process


[1/19/2024 3:45 PM] .deciusmus
well export_vault.py already exists


[1/19/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
and is an automated copy process


[1/19/2024 3:46 PM] rsulfuratus
right but i'm saying don't. there is no point in an automated process to copy files to a directory that isn't managed by export_vault.py


[1/19/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
I think you are missing my point


[1/19/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
although it doesn't matter very much


[1/19/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
what I am trying to say is that if you make a change in taelgarverse.css I want to get that change automatically without having to think about it


[1/19/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
whereas if you make a changein homepage.css I want to ignore it


[1/19/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, okay. i guess i don't want to apply css changes automatically ever


[1/19/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
but your workflow does in fact apply them automatically


[1/19/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
in fact, it can't not, right?


[1/19/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. if I push a change to leaflet.css to taelgarverse-site-gen you get it automatically


[1/19/2024 3:48 PM] .deciusmus
similarly, if I (accidentally) pushed a change to homepage.css in taeglarverse-site-gen, you would also get it automatically


[1/19/2024 3:48 PM] rsulfuratus
only because i didn't realize that overrides/assets/stylesheets works


[1/19/2024 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
my refactor would be to completely drop all css and site image management from export vault and instead put it all in overrides


[1/19/2024 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
See, I don't like that


[1/19/2024 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
if you are fiddling with leaflet I don't want all your changes until they actually work


[1/19/2024 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
Because what if I decide it would be useful to change the Javascript to use ext-summary-box instead of ext-one-column


[1/19/2024 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
then I break you


[1/19/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
But I mean, we are not a big team 🙂


[1/19/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
it is easy to just communicate about that


[1/19/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
and treat the shared stuff as a template not auto-copied


[1/19/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right i mean we already face that problem because you have to change mkdocs.yml in some cases


[1/19/2024 3:52 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/22/2024 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
i am in the (slow) process of refactoring my taelgar python code, as i've found that a number of the export vault functions are also useful for things like the session note summarization code and other gpt things, so I'm refactoring to reorganize functions/classes in a more sensible way for reuse

ultimately, i'm planning on moving everything to the taelgar-utils repo and deleting the site gen repo

when I do, i'm going to restructure the accessory website files as discussed above, so that the website/overrides directory contains shared CSS and overrides, and the website/extras directory contains examples of non-shared stuff (e.g., my home.html and homepage.css, styling.css, my logo and banner image, various other things)

export_vault.py will copy files in overrides to a specified dest in your website repo, overwriting files of the same name but not touching anything else in the dest; you'll need to manually manage anything not in the website/overrides directory


[1/23/2024 9:29 AM] rsulfuratus
i had 20 minutes before a meeting this morning and was messing around with code to auto-generate index pages for taelgarverse. 

the main use case I had in mind originally was to make a nice index of session notes, with taglines and in order of DR, since having them in the nav sorts poorly and looks bad.

but, it would actually be quite easy to adapt this to a number of other possible uses, e.g. make an index of NPCs, or even something like people in X. 

however any useful extensions probably depend on writing staticified information to metadata, since if I want to e.g. generate an index page of NPCs sorted by home location and then current location, I need that information in the metadata.


[1/23/2024 9:29 AM] rsulfuratus
i assume it would be pretty straightforward to write out an arbitrary metadata in the prep_for_export script?


[1/23/2024 9:29 AM] rsulfuratus
since you are already adding activeYear


[1/23/2024 10:15 AM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/23/2024 10:15 AM] .deciusmus
pretty straightforward


[1/23/2024 10:15 AM] .deciusmus
mostly just it slows it down


[1/23/2024 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
the obsidian api to rewrite frontmatter is slow, and I "fixed" the performance for active year by only writing it for people who have a birth year > current year


[1/23/2024 10:18 AM] rsulfuratus
ah, okay. so it might be a little annoying to add home, origin, current, last known, age, etc to every page


[1/23/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not doing anything with this anytime soon


[1/23/2024 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
It is slow proportional to the number of pages not the metadata per pag

the number of pages with "interesting" metadata might be relatively low, i.e. we could say that the only thing we really care about is "currentLocation" and do something like

if the whereabouts field is itself a string, do nothing, otherwise replace whereabouts with a simple string of the current location


[1/23/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
then your python logic could just use whereabouts as a simple "where is something" check


[1/23/2024 10:24 AM] .deciusmus
you could do something similar for home, I guess, as well, although I wonder how useful that is


[1/23/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
I might actually just add a simple whereabouts parser to my obsidian note class. The actual whereabouts code is pretty compact, it is all the token parsing and the like that is very complicated


[1/23/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
Also true


[1/23/2024 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a change so that if you set

staticify_whereabouts = true

in website.json 

prep for export will add

whereabouts_current
whereabouts_home
whereabouts_origin 

to the frontmatter


[1/23/2024 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
it doesn't seem that slow in my light testing


[1/23/2024 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
but it defaults to off


[1/23/2024 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, thanks. too busy with work to mess around much at the moment and want to finish session note cleaning first but may play around at some point

would be kind of cool to append card grids for NPCs where home is X to page X for example


[1/23/2024 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
appending npcs to places is kinda painful though when you have 25 npc that live somewhere


[1/23/2024 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
spent a lot of time cleaning up timelines:

[1/23/2024 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
every mirror vision


[1/23/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
That’s pretty fancy


[1/23/2024 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
all events since the campaign started:
```dataviewjs
await dv.view("_scripts/view/get_EventsTable", { yearStart: "1748-03-22", yearEnd: "1749-04-01" } )
```


[1/23/2024 11:04 PM] .deciusmus
How did you make the big timeline? Python?


[1/23/2024 11:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the one of all the mirror events is in dataview. I have all mirror events tagged with (recharge:: mirror) so it is just 

```dataview
LIST WITHOUT ID events.text FROM "Campaigns" flatten file.lists as events where contains(events.recharge, "mirror") sort events.DR
```


[1/23/2024 11:17 PM] rsulfuratus
to summarize session date information, I used my generate_index_page.py script which can take an arbitrary template on the command line to output metadata. then a bit of cleaning in R


[1/24/2024 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
fyi, I did have a dataview replacer working at one point, but it didn't seem to work well with the string format stuff -- for some reason the metadata wasn't flowing correctly


[1/24/2024 10:04 AM] .deciusmus
but I bet the standard datatable would work, if it seems work adding I can


[1/24/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
my main interest is in autogenerating index pages, and timelines, but I think staticifying dataview is a bit tricky here as it would require reintroducing the "pre-Obsidian" file cleanup step


[1/24/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
(although not for the mirror visions, specifically)


[1/24/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
although I guess with decent page filters the timeline stuff might not be too cluttered


[1/24/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
Why would it require the clean? My code:
Takes all dataview code blocks
Calls a dataview api to turn them into markdown
Replaces the block with the markdown


[1/24/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
The problem I ran into is that the string formats were always blank but I never figured out why


[1/24/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it worked fine for regular dataview (as opposed to dataviewjs) pages


[1/24/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
The only real downside is
Time during prep-for-export
You need to wrap stuff you don’t want on the web with campaign:none


[1/24/2024 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
the true secrets wouldn't be in the copy of the file that is staticified since my DM directory isn't shared. but there are a lot of little fiddly things like a bunch of events on npc pages. but like I said with careful page filtering it might not matter


[1/24/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
certainly for the list of mirror visions a dataview replacer would be  useful


[1/24/2024 5:22 PM] .deciusmus
All I'm really saying is that
(a) I had the code in a branch
(b) it didn't work with dataviewjs correctly, and I didn't feel like trying to fix it
(c) so I gave up
(d) but it did work with regular dataview stuff
(e) so if having the prep-for-export replace regular dataview stuff with a markdown table would be useful, I could dust off the code


[1/24/2024 7:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes, didn’t realize you had it working. That would be useful


[1/24/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
Pushed a change


[1/24/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
it will make ```dataview``` blocks static (but not ```dataviewjs``` blocks


[1/24/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
you can turn it off by setting staticify_dataview: false in website.json


[1/24/2024 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
it adds very little time as it only processes files with dataview blocks


[1/27/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
My players are constantly asking about what people do with bodies, esp in the face of necromancy, so I was looking to finalize the “human funerary traditions” stuff I wrote a while ago. There’s a doc in brainstorming I’m mildly rewriting, do you think anything is very wrong there?


[1/27/2024 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
there is a lot there and i'm not convinced all of really needs to be canonical, but also don't think any of it is necessarily very wrong.

on the topic of necromancy, i think there is an important distinction between mindless corporeal undead (skeletons, zombies) which don't affect the soul at all, and things like ghosts, specters, wraiths which represent a trapped soul unable to reach the land of the dead.

plenty of people would see the former as a violation and evil, and I would imagine that cremation and/or burial on sacred ground would be commonly seen as a way to prevent that. 

the latter has nothing really to do with the treatment of the body, as least not metaphysically


[1/27/2024 10:36 AM] rsulfuratus
i think the one comment / change i'd make about the brainstorming doc is i'm not sure that Mos Numena needs to have a general, culture-wide preference for burial over cremation


[1/27/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
I wasn’t too worried about the Chardon/dunmar/Mawar parts, but was working up the sembaran bits to publish basically


[1/27/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
I was going to leave Chardon/dunmar/Mawar in brainstorming


[1/27/2024 10:38 AM] rsulfuratus
right, just saying I don't think Sembaran burial tradition (which does need to exist as a strong preference for burying bodies instead of cremation for your plot to work) necessarily should be presented as a twist on the universal Mos Numena preference for embalming


[1/27/2024 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. Chardon may very well tend to cremate the dead


[1/27/2024 10:39 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah, agreed


[1/27/2024 10:39 AM] rsulfuratus
there is a lot of lore developed here just to set up a backstory conflict for Wazir that i'm not sure needs to be canon


[1/27/2024 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
I’ll push something new soon.
The basic idea is that Drankor had a “10 days of mourning” around the body/guidance through the land of the dead


[1/27/2024 10:40 AM] .deciusmus
But with undefined ideas of what happens to the body after that


[1/27/2024 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
Kestavo tradition is strongly tied to the idea of burial in a sacred space to make the kestavo more easily able to find the soul


[1/27/2024 10:41 AM] .deciusmus
In sembara, this persists as a cultural preference for burial


[1/27/2024 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
right, but i think without the theological argument for burial based on resurrection of the body, combined with the risk of zombies, you need some pretty strong constraints to have burial be a stable preference


[1/27/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
actually one could imagine that in 1750 Sembara cremation is preferred, specifically because of the zombie uprisings in 1720


[1/27/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
even the Kestavo tradition it is unclear why the body needs to be buried intact as opposed to cremated first, although it would be easy to come up with metaphysical arguments here


[1/27/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
i think I would actually work from this:
- in Drankor / early Mos Numena, you have the 10 day preparation of the body, where the soul is seen as tranisitioning and still needs the link to the material plane, but after 10 days you have a variety of cultural preferences not driven strongly by religion or metaphysics, left undetermined. Drankor was powerful enough magically that perhaps the risk of undead was just not seen as something serious 
- the kestavo have a strong tradition of place-based religion, and the idea that the kestavo needs to find the body. burial in places the kestavo watch is assumed to prevent necromancy. you get the place-based burial ideas, and perhaps cremation is seen as risky, since without the locus of the body, maybe the kestavo can't find the soul. ghosts might be seen as coming from people who died in particularly tragic ways that destroy the body. whether this is exactly true doesn't really matter.
- sembara just mixes these, slotting in mos numena temples for kestavo sacred spaces, and probably just adopting the lore that a) temple grounds prevent undead, and b) destroying the body risks the soul being lost


[1/27/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess this is probably pretty consistent with what is there already, only skimmed quickly


[1/27/2024 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
This is actually where my players are going, to encourage everyone to cremate bodies


[1/27/2024 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
And actually, so far in game, the zombies have been focused on coming from the forgotten dead, i.e. out of the woods, from battlefields, etc


[1/27/2024 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
Which would be consistent with burial in a churchyard actually providing some real protection from necromancy


[1/27/2024 12:41 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that is probably at least partially correct


[1/27/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
On this, I think the kestavo tradition is something like:
- the focus is on burial immediately, because the kestavo aid the transition **to** the land of the dead, as well as guide people through it, and if they can't find the soul, it is in danger of being a lost ghost in taelgar
- burning before burial makes it harder for the kestavo to find the soul - the body provides a locus that gets lost in cremation, to connect the kestavo (who lives in a place) with the soul


[1/27/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
So there is a fairly strong tradition around burial, although it could be that outside of the kestavo burial is not a popular tradition in Taelgar. The kestavo are fairly unique in being (a) small gods and (b) of a specific place


[1/27/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I'm imaging that burial falls out of favor during the tradition to pantheonic religions on Hkar after the northerners leave but before the mariner exodus


[1/27/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
so burial traditions in Taelgar in the current day are largely in cultures influenced by northern folk religions


[1/27/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
I think that kestavan tradition persists in Sembara, with specific Mos Numena god of a place taking the place of the kestavo, and the temple taking the place of sacred place, but the preference might be more cultural than anything else, and for example, in cities might have already disappeared for space reasons. Maybe burial is seen as a countryside tradition in Sembara, mostly


[1/27/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
Sure this works, but it could also be a fairly unique-to-the-kestavo thing


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
well, so far only two northern cultures well developed are Deno'qai and Kestavo. Deno'qai definitely seem more like cremation types


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
you burn the body with the offerings to the tanshi to take up the soul


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Kestavo obviously burial types


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
Right. What I'm saying is that the Hkaran tradition is probably unimportant


[1/27/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, fair


[1/27/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
It could well be that cremation was always the tradition on Hkar and burial specifically developed with the kestavo around gods of a specific place


[1/27/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Or whatever, I think it doesn't really matter


[1/27/2024 12:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i was just thinking if you wanted to preserve a burial conflict in Wazir's backstory it would make sense for the Mawar to also have a burial-based tradition derived from the influence of the old (now extinct) northern culture


[1/27/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, sure


[1/27/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
I forgot about Wazir's backstory


[1/27/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure it really matters because it never came up, although if you all ever go looking for Kaeso, Wazir might resurface


[1/27/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
or if we ever play Mawar again


[1/27/2024 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
for sembaran doesn't matter at all and of course it can be left undetermined where exactly the kestavo burial tradition came from


[1/27/2024 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
Right. At some point I want to write up Wazir's story, but I'm not attached to the conflict being specifically around burial per se. The important point for the character was just that it was around something to do with the death of one of his kids. It could be funerary traditions themselves, not burial. Or what tokens you cremate the body with


[1/27/2024 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
Or inheritance or what you do after death or whatever. Lots of options there.


[1/27/2024 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, of course


[1/27/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
I think I like the Sembaran tradition being somewhat mixed, and probably the idea of cremation being fairly common south of Sembara - Maseau, Adderfell, etc.

And in the cities (Embry, etc) cremation is also a lot more popular, or mass burial in religiously blessed crypts


[1/27/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the urbanized parts of the Drankorian Empire definitely would have been on the cremation side of things


[1/27/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
So Chardon and Cymea would definitely have strong traditions of cremation, not burial


[1/27/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
This matters btw for the amount of zombies Apolloyon has access to 😄


[1/27/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
I expect it to be very few, because all the Drankorians were fans of cremation 😄


[1/27/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
well, no one went into Drankor and burned all the bodies of the people who died in the plague


[1/27/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
true enough


[1/27/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
that's why Kharsan was Grash's base - lots of people died in the plague and were never cremated. also why the order of the awakened soul cared so much about finding the lost dead


[1/27/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I might make Isingue have an unusual tradition around death, derived from the magic water


[1/27/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, that would make sense


[1/27/2024 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
which might also give the Isinguese community something to be cohesive about that sets them apart from Sembara generally


[1/27/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that's a good idea


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
Although what would the unusual tradition be? I'm introducing some Isinguese to my game soon, so it might come up, although I doubt the specifics will (unless I want to make some kind of conflict where the Isinguese are uncomfortable with mass cremations or something)


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
it could be something like a strong burial tradition that is specifically isinguese and derives from the idea that souls nourish the land or something.


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
but you need the body to decay naturally


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
I like that at first thought


[1/27/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so cremation isn't bad for the soul, they wouldn't mind exactly, but it is kind of wasteful


[1/27/2024 12:57 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps in reality this is in part how the magic waters actually worked in some way


[1/27/2024 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think that's great. So in Greater Sembara, you could have 3 main influences:

* a kestavan traditional of burial very focused around the initial period of travel both to and through the Land of the Dead but with much less concern for the body after that period
* an Isinguese traditional of burial more tied to the idea of natural decay, and the idea that is a spirtual benefit to letting the body return to the soil (which feels very ranger-y as well)
* a Drankorian tradition of cremation after the 10 days of "laying in state" so to speak


[1/27/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
In the north and west of Sembara, which was more influenced by the kestavo, the kestavan tradition has resulted in a culture of temple burial + crypts/mass graves, after the ritual period of mourning
In the more coastal and urban parts of Sembara, cremation is the norm, after the ritual period of mourning


[1/27/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
Maseau is probably more influenced by the Isinguese tradition, as would Aurbez


[1/27/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess I just mean the Isinguese in those places probably maintain the traditions more strongly


[1/27/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
In Tyrwingha, I'm not sure what the story would be. How does a lot of fey around influence things?


[1/27/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the fey probably don't really interact much with human burial traditions. the fey have a very different relationship with death than humans, their souls don't necessarily pass on to some divine realm. it is probably more like reincarnation, with the extent to which a particular fey is still "themselves" dependent on lots of complicated factors


[1/27/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
but e.g. if you kill an archfey on the material plane, it isn't like they die


[1/27/2024 1:05 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I was going to say the same. Having a strong fey-influence in the culture probably has little impact on burial


[1/27/2024 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
and a fey that was banished from the feywild might just have their soul utterly destroyed if they die


[1/27/2024 1:06 PM] rsulfuratus
(this is theoretically in part why Agata when to such elaborate lengths with the ring of the warded mind and the whole deception around that)


[1/27/2024 1:06 PM] .deciusmus
Although Tyrwingha might have a greater sense of a second life in the feywild as a possibility, instead of death (or at least, as a way to prolong life)


[1/27/2024 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, in terms of escaping death / cheating death / prolonging life the presence of the fey would be a big factor. but once you die, doesn't really matter


[1/27/2024 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
Unless there is a sense of possibility, i.e. I could imagine a young widow in Tyrwingha feeling that cremation is more final, because then she can't make a bargain with a fey to bring her husband back, or whatever.


[1/27/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
sure. i think also Tyrwingha is less influenced by Drankorian culture overall, so you might still have kestavan ideas lingering even without a real kestavo presence


[1/27/2024 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
in the modern day it doesn't share much culturally with the Zimka after 1000 years of cultural divergence but something like burial traditions can persist a long time without something to shake it up


[1/27/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/27/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
And during the Drankorian period, the Tyrwinghans were probably distinguishing themselves via something


[1/27/2024 1:10 PM] .deciusmus
*from Drankor, I mean


[1/27/2024 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
one of the things that history of humanity book I read talked about a lot is that how a lot of cultural traits that persist are defined in opposition to something else. So you could imagine the Tyrwinghan culture hangs on to burial as a well of keeping their identity separate from the Drankorians, even though they end up adapting the Drankorian religion basically because Ethlenn asks them to


[1/27/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/27/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
also, there is probably a sense in which the gods aren't super prescriptive every specific ritual practice


[1/27/2024 1:12 PM] .deciusmus
Right, exactly


[1/27/2024 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
So the *gods* don't seem to care what you do, it is more a cultural thing


[1/27/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
especially Mos Numena which have a very kind of archetypal vibe. The Traveler is never going to send you a dream telling you how to bury your parents.


[1/27/2024 1:13 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/27/2024 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
whereas e.g. the various small god traditions might care a lot more where the kestavo are basically like we can't help you unless we are close to the body


[1/27/2024 1:15 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/27/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a initial doc: Human Funerary Traditions. Marked status/tim


[1/27/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
I will push something about kestavo + sembaran later, plus a bit of cleanup in the brainstorming doc


[1/27/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
planning on sharing with my players later this week, so let me know if ou have changes you want me to make when you get a chance

{Reactions}
👍

[1/28/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at various status/tim things. 

on Avatus: don't have strong feelings human vs hobgoblin; feel free to choose, or he could be something else entirely. 

I think the exact history of where this dominion came from can probably be left a bit unclear. 

I do think the vibe kind of suggests that in the aftermath of the fall of Drankor, Sembara is a bit of a backwater, initially. Especially once the Dunmari arrive in late 1100s and clear up the lingering curse, you have a pretty powerful set of realms from Cymea - Isingue - Dunmar - Chardon. 

The Skaer in a more raiding phase, and the Dominion of Avatus, really kind of hem in Sembara pre-Derik I.


[1/28/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
Yes; definitely think his dominion origination unclear for now; I do think the breakup of a fairly large autocracy is a good way to expand Sembara without "conqueoring" in the usual sense, so I like Avatus stretching basically from the mountains to Tyrwingha


[1/28/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
and Maseau/Addermarch/western Sembara comes from the collapse


[1/28/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so it does play a bit into the human/hobgoblin/other decision, to think a bit about whether the reconquest is liberating basically still intact populated areas that were ruled by Avatus, or resettling depopulated areas?


[1/28/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
of course viable to have either option for human or hobgoblin or something else


[1/28/2024 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
i might actually be inclined to make Avatus a bit more unique/powerful in his own right than just human/hobgoblin, but without making him fantastic enough that it feels weird his unusual nature hasn't come up


[1/28/2024 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
I'm inclined to leave his exact nature somewhat undefined. He clearly has hobgoblins working for him, but I think he had motivations that were not exactly just pure destruction and murder


[1/28/2024 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that seems right


[1/28/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
At the same time, I think violence depopulates a place pretty rapidly.  So for practical purposes, I think a Maseau, for example, ends up being a "new" place after Avatus. If the deep history of Maseau ever matters, it probably isn't the case that there were literally no humans then when Avatus was defeated. But at the same time, the political structures were imposed by Derik I as part of the foundation of Sembara


[1/28/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
imposed is probably the wrong word - received gracefully. And then it became a land of a lot of new settlement


[1/28/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
So by the time of the Great War, Maseau and the other "new" duchies in Sembara are pretty Sembaran.


[1/28/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
But also, I guess, pretty Sembaran only in the sense of loyal to the House of Sewick


[1/28/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
so when things start to fall apart after the Great War, there is a distinct sense of place for Maseau


[1/28/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean it depends a bit on Avatus' motives. if he needs agricultural productivity, he is going to reign in his armies and make sure they don't massacre the peasants


[1/28/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, people will still flee


[1/28/2024 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, not sure it matters too much


[1/28/2024 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think what I'm actually trying to say is that whatever political entity did or did not exist pre-Avatus is functionally irrelevant post-Avatus. Maseau and other parts of western/borderland Sembara probably are generic "Sembaran/Drankorian" types, with fewer than usual Zimka/kestavo influences with a somewhat irrevelvant pre-Avatus history


[1/28/2024 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, agreed


[1/28/2024 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
I do think there is probably some sense of culture/people that is distinct from the heartland duchies


[1/28/2024 6:25 PM] .deciusmus
And so Derik I basically creates a new Duchy of Maseau where the duke is loyal to Sewick and declares a bunch of the land part of the royal demense and then leaves the Duke to run the place similar to how the dukes run the heartland duchies


[1/28/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the main semi-canon effects of Avatus are whatever you've introduced in your campaign, and the idea that the edge of the Sentinels west of Isingue remains something of a wildlands, a place where hobgoblins and other nasty things linger. you have e.g. Revaka three generations later, and then the various hobgoblin attacks / armies in the high school campaign


[1/28/2024 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so Avatus is kind of a useful placeholder there - defeated, but not every bit of his army wiped from the earth


[1/28/2024 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes I agree that the pre-Avatus political structures become irrelevant post-Avatus


[1/28/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
I imagine somewhat of a gradient, the upper Isatoros watershed is probably still pretty dangerous until post-Great War, when the shifting plaguelands prevent travel from going south via Isingue


[1/28/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. in 1500 you'd have a major trade route running via Urlich Pass and another running south from Cleenseau -> Maseau -> Isingue


[1/28/2024 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
but say, Raven's Hold is probably pretty marginal/doesn't exist/definitely isn't on a human trade road


[1/28/2024 6:28 PM] .deciusmus
Post Great War things shift as Urlich is destroyed (the impact of that I think was pretty brutal, it probably pretty much entirely depopulated the Duchy of Brovna, which I was envisioning as one of the richest duchies, sitting in Urlich / trade center  etc)


[1/28/2024 6:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Ravens Hold is originally constructed as part of a series of defenses in northern dunmar against hobgoblin activity pre-Great War


[1/28/2024 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
right, that fits the above perfectly


[1/28/2024 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
although I guess also with Ardith still intact the heart of the mountains were probably safer


[1/28/2024 6:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Below the mountains, yes. But I think the foothills were pretty dangerous


[1/28/2024 6:30 PM] .deciusmus
but the sweep of land where the Reofounded Alliance of Aurbez is now would have been pretty dangerous as well, I imagine


[1/28/2024 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes. Ardith would have been pretty fortified as well


[1/28/2024 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, in my "grand sweep of Sembaran history v2" I'm basically imagining, with the fall of Avatus, a series of powerful duchies established along the borders - Maseau and Brovna, in particular - which is a big expansion in the size of sembara and a big centralization of power as these duchies are much more under the control of the monarch than the traidtional duchies


[1/28/2024 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
added a few small notes to the human funerary traditions page, but generally would say it is good


[1/29/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
You have a misaligned SECRET tag in Drankoran Empire page


[1/30/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed the updated funeral stuff


[1/30/2024 9:56 PM] .deciusmus
The tyrwingha page is still a bit vague but the rest I think is done


[1/31/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
I'm trying to clean up my Cleenseau NPCs because my players have started asking if random people they met 4 sessions ago are still around...

So I was trying to find all the people who are in Cleenseau, includingthe people I've created without whereabouts...

Do you have concerns if I set simple whereabouts on some people, i.e. 

Adam Gower = Tollen
Yelena = Ursk
etc?


[2/1/2024 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
nope that is fine


[2/1/2024 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
btw my next game is Sunday, was hoping to use the funeral stuff, if you get a chance to look would be great


[2/1/2024 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
also I just pushed a few comments on funerary traditions - nothing major basically look great to me

👍

[2/1/2024 1:24 PM] .deciusmus
one note, the Drankor stuff I wrote for my own background but is not something I'm going to publish. I intended it to be "canonical inspiration for Sembara" but not necessarily a canonical representation of what Drankorians actually did

{Reactions}
👍

[2/1/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
I did one more pass through what I wrote, and updated the Tyrwingha page. Mostly reorganization, so there is a page in "Brainstorming" for ideas. I moved some of your notes into brainstorming or incorporated into the body of the text.

Will likely publish tomorrow after I do a little bit of NPC cleanup


[2/1/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
If you get a chance the main thing to look at would be Tyrwingha


[2/1/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it all looks good. i might at some point flesh out in a bit more detail some of the religious history, both the northern folk religions and the dunmari have a basic framework of "we need to help ensure the soul gets to the land of the dead but then the gods take over" vs mos numena "the gods will make sure the soul makes it to the land of the dead, but we need to help with the journey"


[2/1/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in terms of actual metaphysics both transitions are potentially fraught


[2/1/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but it is probably the case that the small gods of the northern folk religions (which also probably represent the original human religious tradition, more or less) actually do have more desire/capacity to shepherd souls, as they have always seemed more physically real than the more archetypal gods (mos numena, kaikkea)


[2/1/2024 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah. I assume that both transitions are technically fraught, but that the religious traditions developed in part because the gods actually do (mostly) do the things people think they do


[2/1/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
well there is probably something of a feedback loop as well


[2/1/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
It seems wrong to me that Drankor or Sembara would develop a totally false belief that the gods handle the sheparding of the soul into the land of the dead, if there wasn't some real truth to it.

I mean, presumably the reason all this stuff happens is because a group of humans with no death traditions at all, who just didn't bother, would in fact by plagued by ghosts and the like


[2/1/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[2/1/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that the basic idea is that the gods do the best they can but are fundamentally not omnipotent outside their own realms. 

death traditions are a way of amplifying the gods power and filling in gaps, in a sense.


[2/1/2024 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but also different gods have different strengths in some metaphysical sense. the small gods are, well, small, and so there is some sense that an individual god actually reaches into the land of the dead and follows/protects souls on the journey. but they don't have a lot of power on the material plane. 

mos numena has a lot of power so easier to protect the transition to the land of the dead, but then have a bit less influence, etc


[2/1/2024 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
none of this set in stone, just noodling a bit


[2/1/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I like the direction


[2/1/2024 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the general religious history idea is basically you start with small gods that are somewhat weak individually but which can intecede with arhat and malik on your behalf, but they are kind of like a personal protector. so if they can find your soul they can protect it. 

then you have kind of a variety of transitional forms, eventually culmunating in urban Hkar tradition that becomes mos numena, where the gods are these strong, powerful archetypes, with tons of power to grant miracles, but much less personal.


[2/1/2024 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
on elves - I think my vision is that this isn't a longing for something else, or a weariness of the world, but more of just a feeling that this time is complete. it would be like a sense of "doneness" more than anything else.


[2/1/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[2/2/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i pushed a religious history of taelgar brainstorming page that tries to centralize some of the strands/ideas about development of human religion on hkar and the impact on extant religious traditions


[2/2/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
I really like that as a general history. It seems to pull together the metaphysical underpinings of a lot of the strains of thought elsewhere and feels like it fits pretty well


[2/2/2024 1:54 PM] .deciusmus
I like the idea that Mos Numena develops by basically the process of re-definition of other gods as archetypes of a "bigger" god, which is a good explanation for how it becomes dominant


[2/2/2024 1:55 PM] .deciusmus
Somewhat unclear is an answer to how demons, devils, celestials, etc came into being


[2/2/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
There is the early idea (i.e. that Thandros expressed when we were hunting the gnolls) that human belief in hell created hell, but the mechanism of how it works in the context of the broad sweep of religious history is a little unclear


[2/2/2024 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
i think on the one hand, this probably doesn't need a strictly canonical answer, there can be lots of ideas floating around in-game


[2/2/2024 2:02 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I didn't mean to suggest we need a strictly canonical answer


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
What  I really like about the doc you wrote is it provides a pretty solid working history which can be refered to make new things "fit" without being precisely prespective


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
however, i was trying to also set up the thread of the outer planes with the idea that, until the development of early pantheonic religions, there is no conception of gods having a home in the spiritual realms


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
they are manifestations of divine energy and conduits of divine energy that exist on the material plane


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but, that doesn't mean that no spiritual realms exist in this era


[2/2/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
But in that context, I was noting that it doesn't help much with the worldbuilding challenge of "what's the background of this demon"


[2/2/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
Right. That makes sense, although I'm not sure I got it from the page


[2/2/2024 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i think this could be fleshed out more but one challenge is that i'm not sure what outer planes should exist in taelgar


[2/2/2024 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
canonically we have nine hells, abyss, pandemonium, arborea, and an unnamed prison dimension from the philosopher's guild note about the binding stones


[2/2/2024 2:06 PM] rsulfuratus
(in addition to the realms of the gods)


[2/2/2024 2:07 PM] rsulfuratus
but there could and probably will be more


[2/2/2024 2:08 PM] .deciusmus
This is where I feel like metaphysics helps. I feel like the fairly well-established metaphysics of the human religions helps clarify, for example, what the "right answer" is to an in-game question about what's going on at abandoned kestavo shrine that appears to be haunted.


[2/2/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
There doesn't need to be a deep and firm set of rules, but the skeleton makes it a lot easier to make up a consistent answer.


[2/2/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
I feel like that is kinda missing from the outer realms


[2/2/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
Not saying it has to be created now or anything, but its a gap in the Taelgar-ian metaphysics


[2/2/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, agreed. i kind of feel like it needs a bit more in-game exposure before it can be consolidated into metaphysics, though. 2025 is likely to involve a huge amount of extraplanar exploration in game so an answer might become clearer in 18 months


[2/2/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
I was about to say something similar, but with the added point that I'm pretty confident our game will get to outer plane stuff somewhat / long before my game does


[2/2/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
I expect to eventually be doing a fair bit with the Far Realms and weird abberations and stuff, but we are averaging ~10 sessions/year (6-7 hour in person sessions, so about twice the length of a DuFr session) so its probably more like late 2025/2026 (when we get to the last arc of my game)


[2/2/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
the far realms feels easier in a way since they are explicitly weird and alien and in some ways it is probably better if there isn't obvious rules or metaphysics that one can derive


[2/2/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
That is also true


[2/2/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
Although just because the danger is on the far realm doesn't mean that the solution isn't somewhere else


[2/2/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
true. 

separately though, i do think one more obvious question that is raised by the history i've sketched out and might be easier to answer now is what happens to the souls of Deno'qai, Zimka, etc. since the small gods don't inhabit spiritual realms, where do they go?


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
probably this is the same answer as where do the souls of people who died before the development of pantheonic religions go


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
one obvious option is reincarnation, but i'm not sure that is correct


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
I actually liked your answer of "beyond the veil"


[2/2/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
Is there a need for a canonical answer?


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess probably not


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
I guess there are some implications, i.e. to Speak with Dead, Ressurection


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
if the soul is reincarnated, do those even work?


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
not so much speak with dead which doesn't summon the soul back to the body


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes ressurcetion would be impacted


[2/2/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess speak with dead just animates the body to speak its experiences


[2/2/2024 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is best if there isn't one specific answer


[2/2/2024 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
I definitely don't think the Zimka believe in reincarnation, and I think in general in Taelgar most religious beliefs should align at least somewhat with metaphysical truths. But it seems useful to have enough flexibility in the metaphysics that a culture where reincarnation is true could exist (although it would probably have to be a small gods culture)


[2/2/2024 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the soul manifests where it goes


[2/2/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i would actually argue the opposite. a religion where souls are reincarnated would likely be a pantheonic religion where, rather than creating souls out of whatever to give people life, the gods send back souls in their domain


[2/2/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
^ yeah, fair point. That could certainly work as well


[2/2/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
But I was thinking of an ancestory worshipping, small gods religion where each soul is carried from the land of the dead to a new birth


[2/2/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
directly


[2/2/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the "default" metaphysics is that it is a one way journey, where souls are created out of ~divinity~ somehow (left completely mysterious) and then return to ~divinity~ in some way after passing through the land of the dead, but there is a lot of flexibilty for belief and for deities to reshape this


[2/2/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
How does this relate to the Plane of Souls/Plane of Consicousness?


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
not entirely clear, although plane of souls is some kind of manifestation of living souls only


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
it is basically the psionic equivalent of the plane of magic in some sense


[2/2/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but fully on the "material plane" side of the land of the dead


[2/2/2024 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
right


[2/2/2024 2:28 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the distinction between primal realms and divine realms in my notes is kind of obselete. the basic idea is that the spiritual realms are divided into the proximate realms (dreamworld, plane of souls, astral plane, whatever else) and the outer planes, and those are divided by the land of the dead


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
i haven't quite worked out the metaphysics of like astral projection and such, and whether you can actually reach the outer planes from the astral plane, etc


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
where does primal magic come from?


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
and in some sense the plane of souls, astral plane, and the dreamworld might all be kind of part of the same metaphysical thing


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
the material plane


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
makes sense


[2/2/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
primal magic is the echoes of the riving


[2/2/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
there is probably also a connection with fey magic to an extent, since metaphysically the echo realms (shadowfell, feywild, mirror realm so far) are effectively part of the material plane


[2/2/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
at some point someone will play a druid and i'll flesh some of this out in more detail


[2/2/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually so far everyone who has played a druid has just basically played a nature cleric with their magic as flavored as coming from gods, no one has actually played a metaphyiscally primal magic user


[2/2/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe i need to introduce a druid npc for a bit


[2/2/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I was going to say one of my players in the Ausson's Crossing miniseries played a dwarven druid, but he decided his magic came from the Baharazel


[2/2/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Where did Kyr's magic come from? Wasn't he "druidish"


[2/2/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
You need a human druid


[2/2/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, why does the (somewhat odd) D&D rule of primal magic actually have to exist in Taelgar? It isn't crazy to think that all magic is either divine or arcane, and a druid player basically chooses whether they are ultimately channeling the plane of magic or divine magi


[2/2/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, maybe. kyr's magic eventually ended up coming from the plane of consciousness in some sense, although metaphysics have shifted a bit since then


[2/4/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i assume you have no particular attachment to any particular details of this:
" In 1550, Rumors of an endless horde of orcs, and worse, reach Embry from Vostok in this time, and an embassy from several of the Vostok chieftains arrives, but is turned back with only a company of knights to support it, none of whom ever return to Sembara. But whatever chaos consumes the north, little of it reaches the Volta, save for rumors. But Jane and Bertram drop the title “High King of Vostok” from the royal titles and Vostok turns inward for its defenses. "


[2/4/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
no, none


[2/5/2024 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
were you changing that?


[2/5/2024 8:11 PM] .deciusmus
I presume you were working on backstory of vostok for the upcoming session


[2/5/2024 11:02 PM] .deciusmus
My big npc list: https://msackton.github.io/taelgarverse1720/campaigns/cleenseau-campaign/cleenseau-campaign-index-of-npcs/

Cards work pretty well


[2/6/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the cards are great. this is all done manually?


[2/6/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
yeah

just hand-cranked with <div> markdown

If you are tweaking the map at some point, can you expand the woods you drew near Cleenseau to include the bit in yellow?

Great South Road:

An ancient road that runs from [[Embry]] to [[Cassons]]. In better days it ran south as far as [[Isingue]], and in the Drankorian era, was said to continue almost 2500 miles to [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] itself.

Although in poor repair in some places, for much of it's length it is paved with wide, smooth stones with drainage ditches on both sides. According to legend many of the stones in the road are a thousand years old, and have never cracked.

----

I'm working on some answers to my player's questions that depend on whether or not the Great South Road is in fact super-good road for travel, any concerns with the above?


[2/7/2024 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
no this is good, it should be semi-magical probably in places


[2/11/2024 9:27 AM] rsulfuratus
looking at your Sembara/lich email, a few thoughts. 

one thing that is not entirely clear to me is how much of this is supposed to be common knowledge in 1749. don't have to settle it all that soon but i think it shades how I think about some of the events you describe, and also might end up being relevant if the Dunmar group starts asking around about how to kill a lich


[2/11/2024 9:28 AM] rsulfuratus
so for example, "Battle of Something between Tollen and Sembara in 1720" fits in a lot better in the current 1749 vibe if it is widely known to be during the "lich interregnum"


[2/11/2024 9:30 AM] .deciusmus
I am definitely envisioning that the Lich interregnum is widely known


[2/11/2024 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
Some of the deeper plotting (ie relationship@with Umbraeth) probably secret and everyone would think the lich was totally defeated in summer 1720


[2/11/2024 9:32 AM] .deciusmus
Also when it started maybe not super clear.


[2/11/2024 9:33 AM] .deciusmus
But the six months from Jan - June 1720 would be widely known as “lich interregnum” basically from when the dead arose from the ground in winter 1720 until when he was defeated in summer 1720


[2/11/2024 9:33 AM] rsulfuratus
right, okay

so I think what you describe fits fine with my feelingn about future history, then. the one thing I might say is that it might be slightly nicer to structure this as largely involving the south/west, and less tollen/highlanders, unless it is the only way to drive your players to tollen and you want them to go there


[2/11/2024 9:36 AM] rsulfuratus
the reason is that this is the period of tollen expansion when e.g. there are pirate wars and tollen starts establishing dominance over western cymea


[2/11/2024 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
which works best if sembara sees tollen as a safe ally


[2/11/2024 9:37 AM] rsulfuratus
but of course a short blip is fine if needed for your campaign


[2/11/2024 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
I don’t really want my players to be interested in Tollen right now. Post lich they might go there to investigate backstory (still working on who the lich is and where he came from)


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
I just wanted a second thrust to the plan for background. My players are invested in the “Enst river valley” pretty heavily so Wisford as a major center is perfect


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
But I don’t want it to feel like “wisford vs the rest of sembara”


[2/11/2024 9:39 AM] rsulfuratus
one option to change the tollen vibe a bit and perhaps play into tollen history is to have the lich intentionally to a terrible job dealing with piracy on the western gulf


[2/11/2024 9:40 AM] rsulfuratus
that would be bad for telham and other coastal powers. maybe even telham is blamed for piracy


[2/11/2024 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
sembara has never been a major naval power but if piracy is growing as a problem in the early 1700s they are probably not completely ignoring it. until the lich, and maybe that provides the opening for tollen to be seen as a savior and end up really dominant


[2/11/2024 9:41 AM] rsulfuratus
a thought, anyway


[2/11/2024 9:42 AM] rsulfuratus
might even be a way to try to get one of the more coastal powers to raise their own army and then declare them a traitor for it as a second front


[2/11/2024 9:44 AM] .deciusmus
The other idea I had was the zimka it is just less made up. But for example the lich could claim the reason the dead are rising has something to do with the baleful influence of the lingering kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] .deciusmus
Which sets up a conflict along the north/west border as a second front (and gives me an excuse to inject some kestavo lore into the game)


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, that works too. actually i think the "night queen has withdrawn her favor" seems a little hard to pull off, since it isn't like actual clerics would notice and feels big enough the gods would kind of push back a little? not directly but at least in dreams or whatever


[2/11/2024 9:45 AM] rsulfuratus
so blaming foreign gods seems a lot easier for the lich to make work


[2/11/2024 9:46 AM] rsulfuratus
although if you convince the people the elders of the night queen are lying, then it works better


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but it does seem like a riskier plan for the lich than blaming kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
Right I was envisionig the night queen thing leading with the lich executing a group of 8 or so elders of the night queen


[2/11/2024 9:47 AM] .deciusmus
But it does seem risky. The kestavo is probably a sounder plan


[2/11/2024 9:48 AM] .deciusmus
And more disruptive to sembara as well as it plays to natural tensions in society rather than trying to create new ones


[2/11/2024 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
that is a pretty good campaign hook for the campaign that the adventurers who end up killing the lich are part of: you start the campaign with everyone having a dream from the night queen summoning them on the quest


[2/11/2024 9:49 AM] rsulfuratus
but i would probably go with kestavo


[2/11/2024 9:56 AM] .deciusmus
In the kestavo world it’s probably  one of the coastal dukes who’s secretly in league with the lich, and one of the highland dukes (chemin or arnsbury) who ends up revolting perhaps after an attempted/partially successful crackdown on kestavo.


[2/11/2024 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the Duke of Seham is the main Lich plant, and mismanages the pirates (maybe even secretly helping) with the goal of keeping Tollen occupied


[2/11/2024 9:58 AM] .deciusmus
So it isn’t that the lich wants conflict with Tollen, he just wants Tollen to be busy and to feel slighted by Sembara so aid from Tollen is more grudging, etc


[2/12/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
have you given much thought to lizardfolk family structure?


[2/12/2024 6:26 PM] .deciusmus
Also did you ever decide Vahiaya level/character class? They might show up leading a group of rangers soon in my game


[2/12/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
And I might need stats. I can just make something up if you didn't have ideas


[2/12/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
had some conversations with Eric about lizardfolk family structure - he played a lizardfolk in the Kenzo solo who was taking care of two babies. but we didn't decide much that was cannon, except a vague sense that a) they probably don't give live birth; b) the young at a very early age are probably mostly aquatic, but unclear when this stage ends, and unclear if this is like a tadpole stage or actual baby lizardfolk. 

from Eric's Mawar character have the sense that at least some lizardfolk have fairly traditional nuclear families at some point


[2/12/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Vahiaya - did not give much thought to a class, but figured probably mostly a martial - either straight fighter or a ranger. does not feel like a paladin to me


[2/12/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like having family structures and biology being (potentially, somewhat) more complex than "standard nuclear family like 1950s humans" for species - one of my players had a few ideas he was mucking around with (generically, not specifically for Taelgar) which struck me as potentially somewhat interesting for lizardfolk


[2/12/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking ranger


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems reasonable. only level constraint would be that in 1749 they are significantly weaker than you, so like 7-9th level at that point, if not lower


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
I was going with 3rd-5th


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
Haven't figured out hich is best


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] rsulfuratus
seems good


[2/12/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
But they retire soon after the undead stuff


[2/12/2024 9:20 PM] rsulfuratus
5th level in 1749 fine too, doesn't really matter to me


[2/12/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
don't necessarily disagree - my only pushback would be I don't want other species to end up in a situation where you need to read 5 pages of lore to play them "properly"


[2/12/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. Anyway not really something I was thinking about much, just offhand. Mostly trying to organize all the undead stuff and plan out a few things for my next session.


[3/6/2024 9:06 AM] .deciusmus
What do you think of Vahaiya as a 5th level fighter (arcane archer) specialized in bow, high dex, medium int/str, lowish wis/cha


[3/6/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
Sure


[3/12/2024 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
playing around with the new character reference option in midjourney. a younger Vahaiya, as a ranger

I like it.


[3/12/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
I actually thing Vahaiya is going to be a signifcant NPC for the next 2 or 3 sessions of my game


[3/12/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
(although the ears feel a little big)


[3/12/2024 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
midjourney really likes big eared elves


[3/12/2024 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't figured out a good prompt to make them more tolkein-esque


[3/12/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to suggest that if you wanted to come NPC them you should, but my next game is Easter Sunday


[3/12/2024 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be fun - but probably can't make it on easter


[3/12/2024 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
what time do you play?


[3/12/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
~12 - 5


[3/12/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
my other 2 scheduled games are April 28 and June 2


[3/12/2024 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
If you wanted to come play them in one of those. Actually June 2 would be the most fun, that's when they are likely doing fey-wild stuff with Vahaiya


[3/12/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I think I am going to be flying to europe that day so it might be a bit much. i'll check my calendar. april 28 is definitely free


[3/12/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
I have one player who can't make the Easter game, so the PCs are splitting up, with 3 of them going to Rinberg to investigate a monster that is dwelling in a lake near there, the other one going back to Cleenseau to bring news. He also might not be able to make April 28 in which case I am going to drag out the Rinberg adventure. If he can make APril 28, that would be the "Back in Cleenseau" and investigating fey stuff with Vahaiya game


[3/12/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
If he can't, it would be June 2


[3/12/2024 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus

[3/15/2024 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
been doing a little bit of NPC note cleanup, in part motivated by the cref option in midjourney making it easier to update old images to better quality new ones, which has motivated me to reorganize status tags a bit. 

curious what you feel the most useful things to track are and what is most important to be "canonical/shared" vs what we can use independently.

so far I am working from the following things I want to track, although this may be too fine grained and some of these can be combined:

## Needs Header Work or Reformatting

1) pages with complete text, but that need header information filled in from session notes or timelines (typically whereabouts and/or campaign info)
2) pages with complete text, but have complications that cannot be fully captured with the current header setup (e.g. a person who the party met as a ghost/undead but also has information about their past life)
3) pages with complete text, but which is not in the most useful format (e.g., history pages that would be better reorganized as a timeline)

## Needs Text

4) pages that need work on the text, where crucial details remain to be invented and so should not be considered complete
5) pages that need work on the text, where crucial details need to be copied from DM notes, session notes, or other notes

## Needs Verification / Validation

6) pages that need to be fact checked against other canonical information
7) pages with a name that needs consideration before it is considered canonical
8) pages that need a look over from someone else

## Other

9) pages that it would be nice to have an image or images for
10) empty pages that need basic header information
11) empty pages that need actual text


[3/15/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
some of these we already have good tags for (6 - status/factcheck, 7 - status/namecheck, 8 - status/tim, status/mike)


[3/15/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
9 - status/image
10 - status/stub


[3/15/2024 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
currently status/refactor is kind of both 2+3, and I'd like to split it to status/refactor (2) and status/reformat (3)


[3/15/2024 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
both status/internal and status/collate basically represent 1, and are used inconsistently. I would replace with status/header (or similar) to represent pages that are missing header details


[3/15/2024 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I would propose:
- status/blankslate for 11
- status/needswork for 4+5; probably don't need to distinguish, but if we want to, could use status/needswork/<> where <> could be notes, internal, wip (for "non-Obsidian info", "Obsidian info", "needs invention")


[3/15/2024 12:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also argue that status tags don't make sense for Campaigns and Worldbuilding, excepting maybe Worldbuilding/Background


[3/15/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I think the main thing id suggest is to try for 2 levels with the 2nd level optional


[3/15/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
I’d don’t care as much about the fine grained stuff as you


[3/15/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
For me the main things are:
The page needs work or invention
This page is mostly complete but needs some “cleanup”
This page is basically just a name placeholder


[3/15/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder if something like
Status/cleanup
Status/needswork
Status/stub

And then sub levels like
Status/cleanup/facts
Status/cleanup/header 
Etc


[3/15/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
Cleanup means “reasonable complete, should be considered canonicalish”


[3/15/2024 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
Needswork means “missing large gaps. The information here is still being developed”


[3/15/2024 1:00 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, okay, that works well


[3/15/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
Stub means: this is an empty page, I (the creator of the page) don’t really have any ideas about it other than the name


[3/15/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
Then keep factcheck namecheck mike tim as separate


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so the top level would be:
stub
factcheck
namecheck
mike
tim
cleanup
needswork


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
that works for me


[3/15/2024 1:01 PM] rsulfuratus
oh, also, I'd like to add a status/image as a toplevel tag


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Why not status/cleanup/image?


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] .deciusmus
Although I don’t care either way


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
running stuff through midjourney is very easy to do when I'm e.g. on a boring meeting on Zoom


[3/15/2024 1:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so to me it feels pretty distinct from other cleanup tasks


[3/15/2024 1:03 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, either way


[3/15/2024 1:03 PM] rsulfuratus
which typically involve collating information across notes which involves a lot more concentration


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
do you know of a way to get the word count of a note in dataview or dataviewJS? I want to make a query to find highly linked notes with litte/no text


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'm sure there is a way to do it in js


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
but I don't know offhand


[3/15/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe I will poke around a bit


[3/15/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a lot of things tagged "status/stub" that have complete headers but no other text. I think these are left over from old uses of stub, as by the current definition stub should mean "this page needs a header". I am planning on removing the stub tag from pages with complete headers, even if they have litte/no text, unless you object


[3/15/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
I think it might be worth reviewing to make sure status/stub doesn't need to be status/needswork


[3/15/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. Duchy of Wisford should be status/needswork, not status/stub


[3/15/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
whereas The Salty Squid is probably just "remove the tag" unless you have some notes on the place


[3/15/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
things that also have status/unknown fine to just remove


[3/15/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
it would really only be a page that has ONLY status/stub where it is obviously something that should have more info


[3/15/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
I am actually trying to just clear all the status/stub pages by adding headers to things that are missing them, and then adding status/needswork as relevant

{Reactions}
👍

[3/15/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
the reason for the note lenght query is to have an independent check for "short notes that are marked as complete" so I can go back and add status/needswork to ones that are important enough to need text


[3/15/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
right, makes sense


[3/15/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
Do you think that there are more fey (i.e. dryads, satyrs, etc) living on Taelgar in Tyrwingha than other places? Or do you think its more one way, i.e. there are a lot of portals, but mostly that means humans -> feywild more than fey -> Tyrwingha?


[3/15/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
haven't really thought about it. but probably yes


[3/15/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
Kiya, the woman who plays Celyn, the fey-touched priest of the Wyrlding, is busy writing 5000 words on Celyn's backstory and wants answers 😄

going way back to my first campaign with Isaac and Nathaniel I had this idea of kind of a "fey belt" from the darkwood through the tywinghan border to the lizardfolk swamp


[3/15/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I had made up a bunch of like ancient standing circles marking fey crossings and things


[3/15/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
does not need to be canon but kind of fits I think with how the area has developed more recently, and with all the ethlenn lore


[3/15/2024 7:38 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a major status tag update. i've reviewed all the "completed" pages (except people), and IMO all are accurately assigned to the correct status (that is, complete)


[3/15/2024 7:41 PM] rsulfuratus
the "status/unknown" ones are a bit more daunting, as there are ~750 of them, but many are in campaign directories where status tags aren't really useful


[3/15/2024 8:27 PM] .deciusmus
I'm pushing a change that removes Zovka, but you should delete it from the map when you get a chance


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
I pushed an update to Tyrwingha... would be interested in your opinoin. Also here:

Tyrwingha is a rural place, with no cities of any size outside of [[Tafolwern]], and most people live in small villages and market towns of between 50 and 1000 people. 

Unlike in [[Sembara]], where themanor  is the main unit of political organization, Tyrwingha is fundamentally organized, from the bottom, around the village, and from the top, around the earls. 

In ancient days, the title of Earl was said to be bestowed only on those human lords who had sworn a direct oath to [[Archfey Ethlenn]] to serve and obey her, and were thus seen as her stewards in the human realms, watching over the land and its inhabitants on her behalf. Today, these earls, of which there are about fifty, are powerful lords, whose bond to Ethlenn derives from their allegiance to the monarch. The earls have a duty to watch over the land on behalf of Ethlenn, and usually they spend at least six months of the year travelling with their retainers and court.


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Each earl has a circuit, which they ride, and a set of villages and towns on that circuit, for which they are responsible. The earl is obligated to provide, to their villages and towns, justice, defense, and charity. The villages are obligated to provide to the earl, labor service. This labor service is traditionally a year of labor for every ten hearths in the village. This can take many forms: in some cases, it is someone joining the earl's travelling court, or the Army of Mostreve. In other cases, it is working the earl's land, in which it is more usually divided up, i.e. six people working the land during harvest and planting, rather than one person for a whole year.

The earl, in turn, is responsible for providing to each village:
* Justice, in the form of appeals from the village Court of All (see below)
* Defense, via their own force of arms, and their retainers
* Charity, in the form of support in hard times, managing the redistribution of food and so on


[3/16/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
Villages are usually self-organized, and the Sembaran model of a manoral lord who oversees the village is not typically seen in Tyrwingha (although a small number of Sembaran style manors do exist along the Aure and the border with Sembara).

Village organization is varied, but all villages manage disputes via the Court of All. This is a village gathering that is empowered to judge and punish crimes, settle disputes between neighbors, and make decisions about how the village will fulfil its labor service to Ethlenn and the earl's.

The Court of All is consisted as an assembly of the village, with one representative for each hearth. So the very poor have no representation, and the wealthy somewhat disproportionate representation, but in many villages there are neither wealthy nor poor, and the general vibe is usually fairly democratic.


[3/17/2024 10:11 AM] rsulfuratus
was away from my computer all afternoon yesterday, looking at this now


[3/17/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
I would make a few subtle tweaks. 

I think that the fundamental relationship with Ethlenn is less about land (e.g., I'm not sure it makes sense to say that all land in Tyrwingha is held in trust for Ethlenn), and more about obligations of service and protection. 

I like the way you've set up earls, but I'd frame it more explicitly like almost a fey bargain. Ethlenn has offerred her protection over the land, and in turn asks for service from the people.

I kind of imagine that long ago, before Drankor, this was more explicitly about a bargain between the people and Ethlenn, and the service might often involve someone spending a year in the feywild. 

Subsequently, this has evolved, and the earls kind of function like a stand-in. 

I think this is the vibe you were going for, yes?

But the land holding stuff doesn't really fit to me, since it would be weird for a fey lord to have an interest in *land* on the material plane, imo.


[3/17/2024 10:20 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense. It is the vibe I was going for.


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
But I also wasn’t sure I wanted to pull in the full complexity of sembaran land holdings. In particular I like the distinction of not being so based around manors, and being more based on service obligations than taxes on land


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[3/17/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
But I agree the “Ethlenn owns the land” is probably the wrong vibe


[3/17/2024 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
I think I would just basically make all land in Tyrwinghan effectively what Sembarans would call folkland


[3/17/2024 10:23 AM] rsulfuratus
except that since there is no taxation on land, there is no reason you can't sell it


[3/17/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
the Court of All in a village is responsible for, among other things, land records and deeds, and so you get a bit of a New England town hall vibe where the village can block a sale they don't want, which tends to make villages a bit insular I guess


[3/17/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
I like that actually though


[3/17/2024 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think it works. so basically you have the following:
- a somewhat feudal relationship with Ethlenn, which is based on obligations of service and protection, although practically speaking the earls serve as a stand in for Ethlenn, and claim the service obligations and provide protection (although, there are probably cases in Tywinghan common law where an earl was unable to get the service from a particular village some year because they had instead done something directly for Ethlenn; there might be some tie in with the army and warlocks here)
- a fairly "modern" concept of private property rights
- a heavily rural, village based society where the Court of All controls a lot of aspects of life in a village, with kind of a New England town hall vibe, which probably means there can be a lot of village-to-village variability


[3/17/2024 10:33 AM] rsulfuratus
Left unsaid are how earls are chosen. Are these hereditary nobility now? I guess yes, although perhaps would be worth considering some variants


[3/17/2024 10:34 AM] .deciusmus
My thinking is that technically, like the electors, the earls are supposed to be put forward by the existing body of earls and accepted by Ethlenn


[3/17/2024 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
But in practice, silence is interpreted as acceptance and so mostly children follow parents.  But it’s formally an elected position where the existing earls are the electors


[3/17/2024 10:36 AM] .deciusmus
So there is some variability especially when an earl dies unexpectedly, ie before having had a chance to have their heir officially selected


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
(The idea being that “earls heir” is a position in its own right, and most earls will arrange for their chosen heir to be elected as the earl-in-waiting before they die)


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think that works


[3/17/2024 10:37 AM] .deciusmus
But occasionally Ethlenn actually does intervene, and other times politics intervenes, so it isn’t “by right” that the position inherits like it is in sembara


[3/17/2024 10:42 AM] rsulfuratus
What is relationship between earls and the crown?


[3/17/2024 10:43 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm… I think the earls should be subservient to the crown but kinda forgot about the crown in the above


[3/17/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
One possible history could be that originally (pre-Drankor), you just had earls, no crown. The earls were basically Ethenn’s court on the material plane


[3/17/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
Then in the deal with Drankor, ethenn creates the royal electors, at this point the advisors to drankor or whatever who have to formally approve whoever is proposed for governor of the province


[3/17/2024 10:45 AM] rsulfuratus
The earls still exist and are fairly independent of the Drankorian hierarchy


[3/17/2024 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
Part of the deal, perhaps, is that certain matter of local organization are devolved to the earls still


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Maybe in the early days post Drankor the monarch is actually quite weak, and the power of the monarch kind of depends on the extent to which the monarch is seen as the actual representative of Ethlenn on the material plane


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Formally speaking the monarch is always supposed to be that


[3/17/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
So earls would owe allegiance kind of analogously to a reagent


[3/17/2024 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
I like that so far…


[3/17/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
could even imagine that the early tales of the earls of Tyrwingha have a bit of a "knights of the round table" vibe, with Ethlenn as the king arthur standin. Maybe "earl" is actually an old Tyrwinghan word for knight

{Reactions}
👍

[3/17/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
I think this would imply that the earls are kind of an independent power base; it is only the assumption/belief that Ethlenn will directly intervene to keep things from going too far off the rails that keeps things working, since in some sense the earls don't actually owe any formal allegience to the monarch themsevles. they owe allegience to Ethlenn, and thus to the monarch as Ethlenn's mortal representative


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
I do think the electors should have more power/something here. The oracle of the riven is envisioned as 7 high level warlocks.


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
the third pillar I'd add is that probably the Oracles of the Riven and the elite warlock cadre in the army should have some connection and perhaps more active power than is described


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
ha yes


[3/17/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus

[3/17/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
It is also interesting the relationship with sembara


[3/17/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Perhaps the Tyrwinghan monarchy is quite weak, and all the times it doubles up with sembara works relatively well because basically the monarch focuses on sembara


[3/17/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
right, I can sort of envision that in times of peace, or in times of dire war, Tyrwingha gets a lot out of a close personal alliance with Sembara, and doesn't give up much, since functionally speaking it doesn't really make any different to the people of Clawyn or wherever who the warlocks say the mortal representative of Ethlenn is


[3/17/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
the real question is what does Ethlenn get out of it?


[3/17/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
and also what does Sembara get out of it?


[3/17/2024 11:01 AM] .deciusmus
I’m getting in the car to go grocery shopping but I will ponder

{Reactions}
👍

[3/17/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
So riffing on what you said above, what about something like this:

In the ancient times, Ethlenn's earls were effectively her court in the mortal realm, and it would have been common for them to spend some time in the Feywild.  The idea of earls having circuits of villages, and villages owning service to Ethlenn via the earls would date to this time.

When Ethlenn made her deal with Drankor, part of the deal was specifically to create the Oracle of the Riven, which in turn had veto power over the Drankorian governer of the province. The Oracle was also the vehicle by which Ethlenn learned magical secrets from Drankor.

Over the many years of Drankorian rule, Ethlenn fades a little bit into the background, and the earls intermix with the Drankorian elite and start to acquire land and more mudane interests. The ideal of the earls as Ethlenn's knights-errant doesn't vanish, but it is less and less likely a specific earl lives up to that ideal. 

The Drankorian provincial governer has little power over the countryside, but does become something of a powerful figure in Tafolvern (and perhaps, the entire city is only founded in the Drankrorian era)


[3/17/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
The earls also start to spend less / no time in the Feywild, replacing it with time in Tafolvern, where the governer is based, and the governer grows into a position that resolves disputes amongst the earls


[3/17/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
The Oracle of the Riven becomes the focus on Ethlenn's interest, esp because of the magical aspect


[3/17/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
When Drankor falls, and danger comes, the position of monarch develops initially as effectively the Oracle's appointed army commander. The warlock cadres date from the time just after Drankor falls, when Tyrwingha has to look to its own defense, and the core of what later becomes the Army of Mostreve dates from this time as well


[3/17/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Over the years, the balance of power generally develops as:

* The monarch is the commander in chief of the army, and is responsible for the safety of the borders of Tyrwingha, and for foreign relations, and acts as a spokesperson for the Oracle of the Riven. 
* In the tradition of the Drankoria governer, the monarch is also the one who is empowered to resolve disputes between the earls. 

But the monarch has little say in the actual governance of the country


[3/17/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Derik III originally accepts the Tyrwinghan crown basically because he wants to be the commander in chief of an army of warlocks


[3/17/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
His heirs are given the Tyrwinghan crown because Ethlenn/the Oracle of the Riven wants Sembara to be responsible for the defense of the borders of Tyrwinghan - safety in numbers, basically


[3/17/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that works quite well


[3/17/2024 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
And actually the post-Great War history of Sembaran and Tyrwinghan kings works perfectly for the idea that the Oracle is effectively being told by Ethlenn when to align with Sembara (because of say, upcoming hobgoblin wars) vs when not to (because the Sembaran king is going to be weak)


[3/17/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I think in modern Tyrwingha, the Oracle is the ultimate authority and are the ones who are still perceied as Ethlenn's advisors. The monarch's authority comes from the Oracle's support.

The Oracle of the Riven maybe is also responsible for selecting earls. That is, it isn't the whole group of earl's who pick new ones, it is also the Oracle


[3/17/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
So you have this shadowy, clearly fey aligned group that is widely still seen to speak for Ethlenn, picking both the monarch and the earls


[3/17/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually kind of like the earls being elected by their peers, as opposed to the Oracle. I think it sets up more interesting political possibilities than if it is just a shadowy council that controls everything


[3/17/2024 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I can see that


[3/17/2024 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the monarch as commander of the army provides a pretty significant check on the ability of the earls to become too independently powerful - and since the core strength of the Tywinghan army is a cadre of warlocks personally obligated to Ethlenn they can't be made to act against Ethlenn's interests


[3/17/2024 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
this also provides incentive for Sembara to invest in a personal union of the crowd. as Sembara is fairly weak in magic


[3/17/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but also explains why it is always just a personal union of the crowns, and Tyrwingha despite a long history is never incorporated into Sembara directly


[3/17/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
it would probably be good to have some rumors or lore about what the people of Tyrwingha think about Ethlenn's motives, although I think it is probably better to leave the truth unclear


[3/17/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe your player who is writing the 5000 word backstory can come up with some theories about what Ethlenn gets out of all of this


[3/17/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that’s a good idea. I’ll ask her what she thinks


[3/19/2024 9:13 PM] .deciusmus

ha one of my former postdocs played basically that exact character in that 3-session adventure I ran last december set in western Cymea


[3/21/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
I sent you a long email one of my players wrote about her character’s backstory. One thing it makes me wonder is — what do the gods and the fey think of
each other?


[3/21/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
Curious if you have any thoughts


[3/21/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
(The character is a multiclass cleric of the wyrdling / fey trickster rogue which is a homebrew variant of arcane trickster with the source of magic being fey)


[3/21/2024 12:59 PM] .deciusmus
Secondarily it makes me wonder what it’s actually like to cast a spell in taelgar. How do they fey grant magic?


[3/21/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
And how does being a wizard or sorcerer feel different from being a cleric?


[3/21/2024 1:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I saw the email just reading it now while I eat lunch


[3/21/2024 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the only fundamental thing about magic is that all magic in taelgar represents the manipulation of extranplanar forces in some way. there is a "magic in taelgar" note in worldbuilding/brainstorming


[3/21/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I have always thought of divine magic (whether technically a cleric or someone like Delwath who is not mechanically a cleric but gets magic from divine beings) as effectively just praying in a some kind of particular way


[3/21/2024 1:08 PM] rsulfuratus
(although Delwath is a bit weird here since early on he did not know the source of his power was a god)


[3/21/2024 1:09 PM] rsulfuratus
you - as the spellcaster - aren't really doing anything, particularly, except opening a path for divine magic to reach the material plane


[3/21/2024 1:10 PM] rsulfuratus
(this bit is pretty undeveloped but the basic idea is the land of the dead acts as kind of a barrier and gods cannot easily reach past it, but living souls allow them to "tunnel" in a way)


[3/21/2024 1:11 PM] rsulfuratus
a wizard (or an "arcane-feeling" bard, like Seeker) would be basically manipulating residue leakage/energy from the plane of magic, represented by ley lines


[3/21/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
sorcerers and warlocks depend on the source of their magic. e.g., Cintra (divine soul sorcerer) was not manipulating residual energy of the plane of magic, she is a personal direct channel that allows Shakun to act through her


[3/21/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the echo realms in various forms (feywild, shadowfell, dreamworld, etc) were "spun out" from Taelgar almost by accident when the material plane was created by the High Gods during the Riving, and that act left resonaces / echos that can also be manipulated


[3/21/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
this is where fey magic, probably also primal magic, some forms of necromancy, etc comes from


[3/21/2024 1:14 PM] rsulfuratus
this is probably somewhat in-between the cleric "I am a channel for a god to act" and the wizard "I can see and feel strands of arcane magic running across the world that I pull and twist to create spells"


[3/21/2024 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
as far as what the gods and the fey think of each other - I guess it would depend a lot on the individual fey, and perhaps the individual god. I don't think there needs to be a settled standard approach here. 

fey are ultimately the grandchildren of the High Gods, via the archfey. some archfey probably see themselves basically as gods themselves and might consider especially e.g. the embodied gods of the elves as peers. they might consider some of the weaker human gods (tanshi, kestavo) as effectively lesser than them


[3/21/2024 1:19 PM] rsulfuratus
one key point is the echo realms are actually harder to reach for the gods than the material plane (they are even further from the divine realms), so gods would be particularly weak in the echo realms


[3/21/2024 1:19 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/21/2024 1:20 PM] .deciusmus
That all makes sense, although when bounced against D&D rules there is a little question of why clerics have to prepare spells


[3/21/2024 1:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think from Celyn's perspective, the basic idea Kiya hinted at - where the fey magic feels like work and the divine magic feels like a gift - fits pretty well


[3/21/2024 1:21 PM] .deciusmus
3 of the 4 characters in my game have the fey touched feat, so there is a a second question I'm trying to answer about how is that different from other magic (although only Kiya of my 4 players seems interested in delving into what it feels like to cast spells in Taelgar)


[3/21/2024 1:21 PM] rsulfuratus
yes - I like the "misty step is something you have to work at to learn to do" angle


[3/21/2024 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean from a overarching point of view I think the key thing to decide is "what extraplanar energy are you manipulating" and "how are you doing it". with possible answers for the first one ranging from "plane of magic" to "feywild" to "plane of souls (this is probably psionics)" to "divine realms" and many things in between


[3/21/2024 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
how you are doing it could be anything from "arcane rituals" to "prayers"


[3/21/2024 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
basically to cast a spell you need a) a power source and b) a way to manipulate / manifest that power source in the material plane


[3/21/2024 1:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense.


[3/21/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but, to take the cleric example, you could imagine all of the following "divine magic users":
- a person born with an innate connection to a particular god, whose soul/spirit/consciousness functions as a conduit allowing the divine energy of the deity to effortlessly flow to the material plane, requiring only that the person learn how to shape the power flowing through them (a divine soul sorcerer)
- a Lakan mystai who has studied the secret prayers and rituals of Laka and learned how to manipulate the resonances of the prayers that flow across the material plane (a wizard)
- a character like Riswynn who is a very traditional "pray to the gods" cleric
- a character like Delwath who I'm not actually sure exactly how he casts spells but it usually feels more like asking for a favor from a particular spirit than praying I think

all those people could be manipulating divine magic in various ways, with very different mechanics

anyway I have a meeting now but maybe I'll update the magic in taelgar notes later today


[3/21/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
BTW, I was thinking about Delwath, I think he has a specific relationship with the tanshi and has almost worked together with each one to craft special abilities. 

So asking for a favor works pretty well as a vibe, but I think he has additionally basically collaborated with each tanshi so that there are these specific favors from each one that work well


[3/21/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus

writing next session - wondering about Delwath's general scrying patterns. assume that, since arriving in Zvervinka, you are not trying to secertly scry in your rooms at night or anything, but let me know if that is not the case. prior to arriving, assume Delwath generally keeps an eye on Chardon, Sura/Karnas, maybe Xurkhaz, but isn't deeply scrying one person unless you tell me


[3/23/2024 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
That sounds about right


[3/24/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
As Kiya - my player  currently writing lots of backstory - writes stuff, it occurred to me that maybe one of the things the fey do in Tyrwingha is protect the place from other weirdness. 

Sembara has a lot of guards and walls around towns, but I think that’s much less common in Tyrwingha. The wild places are full of fey, instead, and although some fey can be dangerous, many fey instead scare off - directly or indirectly - other dangers


[3/24/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
This is part of why there is a tradition in Tyrwinghan villages, especially rural ones, of watching and maintaining fey spaces. People might not understand exactly the bargain, but ultimately having fey around helps keep these small villages safe


[3/24/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
Thoughts?


[3/24/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
I like it - I would add that it is probably precisely because of the tradition of watching and tending the fey spaces that the fey help, in a sense. it isn't just having fey around, it is maintaining the fey bargain that keeps the village safe


[3/24/2024 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that’s the implication I was going for


[3/24/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
so you might have tales of villages where something went wrong, they were attacked by zombies or whatever, and the assumption is that someone forgot to tend to the fey. maybe that is actually what happened

{Reactions}
👍

[3/24/2024 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
Although I’m not sure people in a Tyrwinghan village would necessarily know or see it as “keeping us safe” vs “maintaining ancient tradition”


[3/24/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
i think not precisely keeping us safe, but I think there would be an understanding of some kind of bargain. the fey are not unconditional allies, but if you maintain the traditions and rites, you village has good luck and prospers, and if you don't, you have bad luck


[3/24/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/24/2024 10:27 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah that’s perfect


[3/24/2024 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
in fact this could ultimately play back into the bargain with Ethlenn. maybe for some reason Ethlenn's realm became something of a haven for many fey who missed the material world after the Riving, and part of her deal with Tyrwingha is precisely to leave space for her fey subjets who want to return to the material plane


[3/24/2024 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the full history is probably more complicated but that could be part of it


[3/24/2024 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
Ah, I like that.


[3/25/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
I was doing a little tag cleanup in between meetings... there is a set of pages that I'm not sure the right status... 

For example, the Abyss. The page right now is just "The realm of corruption and chaos, home of demons. " But for most purposes, that is actually a complete page. Is it worth making it status/needswork because clearly there is more to it than that? Or is it better to just make it no-status to indicate its done for now?


[3/25/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
Or should we have a new status tag for things that are clearly insufficiently detailed but seem good enough as long as they are only "observed from afar"


[3/25/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
This comes up a lot in places as well...

For example, I made up a town along the Wistel, Gowerbourne, just to have a place to have a distant battle be occuring at...


[3/25/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
The page has no real information, but it is "enough" unless someone decides to go there


[3/26/2024 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
I think status tags are best used only to indicate "there is canon or near-canon information about this page that is not on this page."


[3/26/2024 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
Right so that suggests that, i.e. the Abyss and Gowerbourne should both have empty status tags


[3/26/2024 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think so


[3/26/2024 11:52 AM] .deciusmus
but, if for example, I had introduced a bunch of stuff about Gowerbourne to my players in email, but not yet in obsidian, i'd make it needs work

And if you had a bunch of backstory notes about the Abyss that impacted events in game but were not cleaned up for obisidian, you might set Abyss to "needs work"

And maybe for a page like "Embry" where although I don't have specific facts or notes, the general 'vibe' has come out in game and clearly there should be a couple of sentences before calling it done, I'd add a needswork as well, not to write a long Tollen-style page, but just to have something


[3/26/2024 11:54 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I've tended to mark things needswork either because I have explicit notes I need to clean up and add, or because I have a sense of the place that isn't well captured in the current text even if I don't have explicit notes

yeah I saw that, cleaning up some of those now

poking around a little bit in your Sembara notes thinking about a backstory for the cleric, and thinking about the Enst dynamic. Fellburn feels like it needs a good anchor that is not primarily economic to me


[3/27/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. I was struggling with that a little bit


[3/27/2024 1:38 PM] .deciusmus
Why does Fellburn matter?

I like the idea that pre-hobgoblin wars Rinburg was another major tradiing area, but post-war hasn't rebuilt the bridge for various reasons. But why does anyone live in Fellburn?


[3/27/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
I was looking at big french cities in 1400 and pretty much they are all on bridges over rivers


[3/27/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, although there are plenty of counterexamples (the Nile was not bridged for most of pre-modern history as far as I can tell)


[3/27/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i think bridge/no bridge is easy to hand wave, perhaps for hydrological reasons if nothing else, but it means Fellburn needs a reason to exist that isn't "trade nexus"


[3/27/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
Right I wasn’t super clear. What I mean is that looking at late medieval France “existence of a bridge” was a pretty good way to get an important city. Not to imply only way


[3/27/2024 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, right, sure

Dijon is the only main example I could find that didn’t have a significant bridge and it became large because of Italian trade fairs


[3/27/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
Ie it was a convenient place for Italian and French merchants to meet


[3/27/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think from the existing Sembara notes, the puzzle is that you basically have this history of the Enst as sembaran borderlands, with all the major cities being sacked at one point or another, but also the vibe (perhaps not canon?) of Fellburn growing faster than Rinburg in recent times and expanding from a more minor city to bigger/more important than Rinburg


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] .deciusmus
That vibe is definitely not canon


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Rinburg is a natural economic powerhouse even absent bridge, given location at height of navigation and presence of major cermanic industry


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
so you can see the vibe of "even though the city was burned, it is a natural place to rebuild"


[3/27/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and the bridge is not economically important because most trade runs east-west not north-south


[3/27/2024 1:47 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[3/27/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not quite sure what the vibe of the small baronies between the Enst and Addermarch is supposed to be in the current day - this was all land that was essentially completely depopulated during hobgoblin wars


[3/27/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing that matters about fellburn canonically is it needs a reason to be worth fighting for.  It has a big skeletal problem entirely because it was the site of several major battles including some sembaran defeats  so lots and lots of unburied dead all over.


[3/27/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
Yeh I’ve been avoiding writing up Vahaiyas “how I came to be north of the Enst” story because I am not quite sure what the borderlands are like


[3/27/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think it was an area of intense resettlement by Cece and a very specific attempt to have more barons directly dependent on the crown


[3/27/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I have always thought of this land as relatively marginal


[3/27/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to poke around for a good real-world parallel


[3/27/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
A lot of court favorites getting land etc from the crown directly. But I’m not sure how that plays out later and I’m not committed to it


[3/27/2024 1:52 PM] .deciusmus
It can’t be that marginal if Wisford is the breadbasket of semabara and it’s just on the other side of the river


[3/27/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess it could be the wistel / north half of wisford that is extremely productive


[3/27/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
And the Enst valley kinda marginal


[3/27/2024 2:02 PM] rsulfuratus
so, thinking a bit more about the climate and topography. i think that there are hills / highlands along the southern border of Tyrwingha, the southern border of Addermarch, but then also wrapping around and extending north. you can see from the river topography that Addermarch is basically a bit of a basin inside the Mostreve Hills, which probably isolates it a bit and also means Addermarch looks downriver more than overland into Sembara


[3/27/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
this probably means the land slopes down from the mostreve hills to the enst, with more topological variation on the south side than the north side


[3/27/2024 2:04 PM] rsulfuratus
the actual Sembaran lowlands extend from the Enst to the Teft, but probably only stretch a little ways south of the Enst


[3/27/2024 2:05 PM] rsulfuratus
so in your Borderlands, Estrive/Monste/Vauclaire are probably good agricultural land, but everything south of that might not be


[3/27/2024 2:06 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense. So you have hilly terrain in the southern 2/3rds of the borderlands


[3/27/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
it might be something like Provence, but if you imagine that, for whatever reason, it is not suitable for vinticulture, you are left without much. animal husbandry and maybe some orchards


[3/27/2024 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
or the southern applachas


[3/27/2024 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
*appalachians


[3/27/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
In the hobgoblin wars timeline, I have the Shattered Ice Clan basically settling the entire region 
(a) north of the Mostreve Hills
(b) south of the Enst
(c) west of the Aure

So Addermarch is on the southern border, and the entire borderlands and northern 1/3 of Maseau is under hobgoblin control for 45 years


[3/27/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
Although I'm not sure if I really meant the Aure, as the rest of the history isn't that consistent with that


[3/27/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so here is a random image of the Danube from the internet that maybe gets the Enst vibe a little bit:

[3/27/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
why not the Aure?


[3/27/2024 2:16 PM] .deciusmus
Just that the history isn't consistent...

- (DR:: 1602): The lands south of the Enst and west of the Aure are ceded to the hobgoblins. 
(DR:: 1644), late fall/winter: The [[Shattered Ice Clan]] breaks the fortifications in [[Barony of Vaubonne|Vaubonne]] and camps outside [[Fellburn]]


[3/27/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
if the land as far east as the Aure is under hobgoblin control, what are "the fortifications" in Vaubonne?


[3/27/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
that would also be under hobgoblin control


[3/27/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
Unless you imagine the 3rd hobgoblin war starts with a major sembaran success, which pushes the hobgoblins very far west, and then a collapse


[3/27/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
But none of that history has to be canonical


[3/27/2024 2:18 PM] .deciusmus
it could actually work well for the entire area south of the Enst to be hobgoblin for 50 years


[3/27/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I would probably make the Enst the de facto southern border of Sembara from 1602 - 161653


[3/27/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
*1653


[3/27/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
Then you could imagine something like

in the 1600s, you have Cleenseau and Rinburg both with bridges to hobgoblin terriority, and Cleenseau builds up an army, but Rinburg makes a go at economics, trading with the hobgoblins, etc

Fellburn because the main garrison town and where the "cold war" with the hobgoblins is focused. 

Then when the 3rd hobgoblin war breaks out, after some early successes Rinburg and Cleenseau are both occupied.

But Fellburn, although it is sacked in 1647, is never really occupied. It is quickly retaken after the sack


[3/27/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
the only problem is the garrison at Fellburn would not then leave to fight in western Masseau


[3/27/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so you have to change the early part of the 3rd hobgoblin war


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
- (DR:: 1644), fall: After several early successes, the Sembaran [[Army of the South]] is fought to a stalemate at the [[Battle of Lysandale]] in the western reaches of Maseau


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
yeah to make that work


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but that could be the Dunfry garrison instead, the army of the west


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
You had some secret reason/idea behind why the hobgoblins started up again


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[3/27/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
But the flow of the war still works fine with the focus initially being a western campaign, focused on maseau, with the western army of sembara


[3/27/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
and the southern army - based in fellburn - is defensive


[3/27/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
I need to draw it out to visualize the territorial changes more clearly


[3/27/2024 2:26 PM] .deciusmus
something like:

1600

[3/27/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
but getting back to Fellburn and the border baronies, I think this still leaves a slight puzzle, because Fellburn is not naturally positioned as a defensive location. so I think Fellburn should have something worth defending to motivate the garrison


[3/27/2024 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
it is kind of a weird shape. why do the hobgoblins push so far west, especially if the border baronies are kind of marginal land?


[3/27/2024 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
1645

[3/27/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I think it is less marginal than the northern third of Maseau, which is hill and also dry


[3/27/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
But Sembara has the ability and will to defend the Enst, so isn't going to give up land north of the Enst. It is a strategic sacrifice on the Sembaran side to give up marginal land to avoid a bloody battle defending the Enst, which the hobgoblins take for similar reasons


[3/27/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Simiarly, the core of Maseau (the southern 1/3 or so where the land is better) is where almost all the people of Maseau live, so they are going to defend their homes to the death. But the northern parts are mostly empty, so easy for the hobgoblins to move in


[3/27/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not entirely sure what is canon and what is speculation at this point, but why not have the hobgoblins move east instead of stretching their territory? at the end of the first hobgoblin war (more or less Sembaran victory) they are confined to what is quite marginal land in western Maseau and Enford; second hobgoblin war starts basically because the hobgoblins want better land, and is more-or-less a hobgoblin victory


[3/27/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
so at the end of 2nd war the hobgoblin territory is basically a crescent north + west of addermarch


[3/27/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
the only bit that's canon is Cleenseau needs to be occupied by hobgoblins ~1645 - 1650 ish


[3/27/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
basically all that changes here is that perhaps there is something of a frozen conflict in western maseau (west of road, south of enford), where the land is not worth big effort and you have a bit of back and forth with maseau but semabara doesn't get involved, having driven hobgoblins south of enst


[3/27/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
then initially 3rd hobgoblin war starts in the west, for mysterious reasons the hobgoblins launch a major offensive, sembara gets nervous about dunfry, and things procede


[3/27/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
then I think you get the following vibes:
- Cleanseau and Rinburg are economically central to the Enst river trade network, and despite occupation / destruction in the 1650 +/- spring back strong; it is possible that one or both actively trades with hobgoblins
- Fellburn is an important city for cultural / religious / historical reasons despite being economically less vibrant than Rinburg, is better defended and seen as something that cannot be lost
- Borderlands south of Enst are fully under hobgoblin rule; people remain in places, but as the Radiant Alliance closes in reprisals are pretty brutal and most structures are burned, so as of 1653 this is quite barren / unpopulated land


[3/27/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
- Addermarch becomes very isolated from Sembara in this period, and draws much closer to Tyrwingha


[3/27/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
(Addermarch has always felt more culturally connected to Tyrwingha anyway)


[3/27/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
(I have a meeting so might be slow to respond)


[3/27/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
So I think what this needs is just a good reason for Sembara to care about Fellburn and for a significant population center there. 

One obvious option is a religious site. Sembara doesn't really have religious organizations per se so the site of an abbey or something probably doesn't work, but you could imagine almost a Bath-like vibe if Fellburn is the site of magical healing waters or something else magical and religious that would drive pilgrimages


[3/27/2024 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Another obvious option is a extraplanar weak point, which could have various and sundry impacts


[3/27/2024 3:04 PM] rsulfuratus
it feels like a magical explanation is correct here, and probably something that predates Drankor, which would potentially make Fellburn a very old area of settlement


[3/27/2024 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I am thinking that the cleric I'm making up is in his mid-50s, so his parents were probably born sometime between 1635-1645. i think that perhaps he has a family connection to Fellburn - his mother fled the sack of Fellburn when she was 10 or 12, or something like that


[3/27/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
still haven't figured out what he was doing before he found magic late in life, stay tuned


[3/27/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
I think this is all good


[3/27/2024 3:36 PM] .deciusmus
So basically the hobgoblin wars timeline needs to change a little so that 
early part of war is fighting in the west and large defensive buildup along the enst
middle part of war is parts of the enst line collapse, but not all, and perhaps fellburn is never actually sacked and a valiant defense of fellburn holds out
late part of war is pushing hobgoblins west


[3/27/2024 3:37 PM] .deciusmus
I like magical explanation for Fellburn being important; I am not sure I like magic healing waters as that is too similar to Isingue I think


[3/27/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, just grabbing that as it is why Bath was an important place in the real world


[3/27/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
but playing on Fellburn, could be something like an eternal flame that magically burns and supposedly removes curses (maybe once an ancient kestavan site). or an oracle of some kind. perhaps kind of a strange oracle - not necessarily divine magic


[3/27/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe a mythical defender - the phoenix of fellburn or something like that, although probably don't want an actual phoenix just hanging out in fellburn


[3/27/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the key feature is something that drives pilgrimages which in turn drives the economy and growth of the city


[3/27/2024 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
right


[3/27/2024 3:49 PM] .deciusmus
A pushed a slight cleanup to timeline of Sembaran history to incorporate the above


[3/27/2024 3:50 PM] .deciusmus
Only bit I am not sure if is if Fellburn should actually be sacked, or if the hobgoblins are repelled. Probably depends on the nature of what is in Fellburn


[3/27/2024 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I'm trying to think of a good idea for that, need to let it simmer for a bit


[3/27/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
The Fell Burn, the Beacon of Fate in the ancient language of the original settlers of the Enst river valley, is a twisting crystalline structure, almost tree-like in form, perched on a rise above the Enst. For as long as anyone can remember, it has been said that, when the light of sunrise is reflected in its twists and turns, the crystals sing, in a language no one knows, but the song sings of hope, of comfort. those who make the pilgrimage in the night, and reach the crystals as the sun rises, say that they hear in the song the answers to doubts that have haunted them. 

Before the Drankorians came, the songs were thought to be Kestavan songs, and the Fell Burn was a sacred place. 

To the Drankorians, it was many things, and strange rumors spread. The most persistant was that, according to the Drankorian mages, it was a fragment of the moment of creation, frozen in time. The Drankorians built a fortification, and soon after a library, and it became a frequent site of travel and study, and the town of Fellburn grew. Many forgot the original meaning of Fellburn, and it acquired many names: the Singing Tree, in the colloquial, the Crystal of Time, among the wizards, and simply the Oracle of Hope to most. 

After the Fall of Drankor, Fellburn persisted - in these days, much seemed dark, and many sought the hope and comfort of the Oracle. Some in these days thought it was a miracle of the Wyrdling, or perhaps the Sibyl, but the priests never claimed a divine presence. 

As Sembara grew, Fellburn came to prosper. It was never the greatest economic powerhouse of the Enst, for the river was too wide here for a crossing, even in Drankorian days (or, the hills on either side too steep), and with no easy harbors it did not lend itself to a riverboat port. 

But, the pilgrims always came, and with them coin, and so the city grew.

[3/27/2024 6:29 PM] .deciusmus
I like that. Interestingly this is very close to the line of sunset in the fey wild.


[3/27/2024 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I was trying to make it very much not fey flavored - kind of thinking this is more of a mystery that shouldn't fit any obvious categories


[3/27/2024 6:31 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah it didn’t read as fey flavored - but it is kinda similar to the Sunset Gate thing I made up in a way


[3/27/2024 6:31 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay


[3/27/2024 6:32 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe change the association with sunrise


[3/27/2024 6:32 PM] rsulfuratus
my thinking is also that this is basically indestructive

[3/27/2024 6:32 PM] .deciusmus
It sings when it will


[3/27/2024 6:32 PM] .deciusmus
Pilgrims sometimes wait days for it to sing


[3/27/2024 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
Sometimes it sings every hour. Sometimes it is a week


[3/27/2024 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I was going for the "hike up mt fuji at night to see the sunrise" vibe but yeah could be just sings when it sings, that might be better


[3/27/2024 6:33 PM] .deciusmus
I think the sunrise connection is going to make it seem fey once my players go to the sunset gate


[3/27/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
right. i actually like the unpredictability more


[3/27/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so I was thinking it is indestructable and couldn't be sacked by the hobgoblins, and also ancient and pre-dates sembara, so probably Fellburn does get sacked, but is seen as a very significant loss out of proportion to its military significance (hobgoblins captured Oracle of Hope) so there is a lot of motivation to recaputre Fellburn


[3/27/2024 6:36 PM] .deciusmus
Right that works. The town is sacked but not occupied


[3/27/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Or only occupied briefly.


[3/27/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have a some idea of what this really is or just random coolness?


[3/27/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
my best guess is the Drankorian wizards are correct, and it is a frozen piece of the Riving, but not committed to that


[3/27/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
my second guess is it could eventually tie into whatever the moon is


[3/27/2024 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
(depending on whether you want it to be significant for your campaign / Igzil)


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm. I will ponder. I like the idea of this a lot though.


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
Are you envisioning it at the center of town? Or outside the town more in a separate space ?


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] rsulfuratus
no, outside town


[3/27/2024 6:40 PM] rsulfuratus
not far outside town, like <1 mile


[3/27/2024 6:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm thinking this part of the Enst is fairly hilly and so this stands on a rise of land above the river, and the town itself is in the valley


[3/27/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
Right that works


[3/27/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
How big are you envisioning it? Like 10 people at a time walking through it? 50?


[3/27/2024 6:45 PM] rsulfuratus
closer to 10 than 50. maybe a dozen?


[3/27/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
presumably there would be some kind of organizations associated with it, a guild or pilgrim's fund or something, that helps keep things organized


[3/27/2024 6:46 PM] .deciusmus
Also how do you feel about undead seeming to be terrified or repealed by it? I have no specific reason but I am sure this will come up soon in my game because the party wants to go see what’s going on with the siege of fellburn right after rinburg


[3/27/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
that would make perfect sense


[3/27/2024 6:47 PM] rsulfuratus
it is small enough it isn't really an effective shelter, but yes undead should avoid it


[3/27/2024 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
(In theory the session you would be npcing at would be part lake monster part roleplaying in fellburn— so having the cleric have some connection to fellburn is perfect he’d accompany the party onward and then stay in fellburn)

basic outline of Armand backstory:
- mother was from Fellburn, fled the sack (probably around 11-12) but was separated from her family, ended up in Embry, found her way onto a ship and became a sailor
- father from local middle class Embry family, maybe a scribe or something
- grew up with mostly absent mother, but always eager to hear stories of the sea, and her stories of Fellburn
- as soon as he was old enough, left home to become a sailor, and traveled on merchant ships around the Green Sea
- was a sailor for several decades, into his 40s or so
- maybe 6-7 years ago, something happened; not sure exactly what yet, but something to do with undead that (a) triggered / opened his mind to latent divine magic and (b) left him deeply concerned with protecting the world from the wandering dead
- returned to Embry and became an acolyte at temple of Night Queen, practicing magic and learning about undead


[3/27/2024 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
I like the basic outline. There is a bit of a vibe I have going with various night queen associated people having a sense of unease before the undead uprising. Perhaps that sense of unease made him leave Embry and go to the Oracle of Hope, So he was in the Enst river valley for Pyravella.


[3/27/2024 8:20 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe in Rinburg (or Fellburn).


[3/27/2024 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure how he joined up with Vahaiya and their crew though. It feels like if he was in either Rinburg or Fellburn at the time he would have gotten caught in in those events and wouldn’t be in Champimont now


[3/27/2024 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe he was in Rinburg when the first wave of undead rose, but at the time no one knew about the lake monster, so he immediately set out on the road to see how he could help. After all in many places it was just one or two zombies, which he’d usually be able to defeat himself.


[3/27/2024 8:23 PM] .deciusmus
He got caught up in the area around Eftly, where a big ghast-like creature devoured the town and literally met Vahaiya and their crew when they came to kill it


[3/28/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
Hrm. I have an NPC (Eremon) who is a (non-magical) acolyte of the Night Queen, from Fellburn, who left Fellburn ~6/7 years ago and was wandering around, and has been recently having premonitions about the undead rising.

I wonder if something happened around when Cece died that foreshadowed the lich in some way.

I kinda like the idea that the lich is ultimately in conflict with the Night Queen, and goes after her elders because they are closing in on him.


[3/28/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
(I mean, he isn't *intentionally* in conflict with her, but he is very anti-theNightQueen, he is basically trying to subvert the natural order of death and so on)

trying to get the villages correct, there isn't really a great map that I can find in Obsidian. Basically you have, west to east along the Great South Road:
Cleanseau -- 6 miles -- Beury -- 15 miles -- Dallet -- 10? miles -- Champimont -- 10? miles -- Eftly -- 20 miles -- Rinburg -- 95 miles -- Fellburn


[3/28/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
is that right?


[3/28/2024 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah basically.


[3/28/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
I have some better notes in my dm folder.


[3/28/2024 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
Let me look in a min


[3/28/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
I should move this to proper notes...

Starting in Rinburg the usual walking route is:

Rinburg to Essenmer (long day on foot, 12 miles)
Essenmer to Eftly (short day, 9 miles)
Eftly to Champimont (very short day, 6 miles, but Champimont is the largest town between Rinburg and Cleenseau)
Champimont to Dallet (long day, 13 miles)
Dallet to Beury (long day, 15 miles)
Beury to Cleenseau ~5 miles


[3/28/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
I haven't made up anything past Rinburg toward Fellburn


[3/28/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
also, if I'm reading the timeline correctly, the attacks basically start all over around Jan 7/8. where is Vahiaya then? by Jan 15th they end up in Champimont, heading west from Eftly where a monster was defeated - but at this point Fellburn has been under siege for a week or so


[3/28/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Armand was with Vahiaya in Eftly, or met in Champimont?


[3/28/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
Unclear.


[3/28/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
or undetermined?


[3/28/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
have a meeting more in a bit


[3/28/2024 1:38 PM] .deciusmus
The undead awaken in 3 waves

* Jan 4th overnight - dead awaken across Sembara, mostly in places where there are large numbers of unburied dead
* Jan 5th overnight - second wave of dead awaken
* Jan 6th overnight - third wave of dead awaken

But in many cases not near civilization or in scattered places, and sometimes take a night or two to move from "awake" to "above ground"

So the basic timeline is in a variety of places across Sembara, problems with undead start as early as the morning of Jan 5th or as late as the evening of Jan 8th


[3/28/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
The Fellburn siege begins in the predawn hours of Jan 8th


[3/28/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
Eftly is attacked on Jan 7th, although the monster grows and becomes big only the 10th-11th (although this isn't canonical)


[3/28/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
I don't have a canonical route for Vahaiya and the Rangers, but the basic idea is:

The 5th or 6th  they get magical communication (sending/speaking stones/etc) of the start of problems, as various groups within Sembara basically start asking the Rangers for help.

Vahaiya is in Addermarch or the border baronies north of the Mostreve Hills and this point, and is one of several groups the Rangers send north. 

Takes 3-5 days to get from wherever to the Enst (near Rinburg, I guess). But some encounters or problems could have delayed this a bit. 

I haven't entirely figured out why the Rangers didn't stay in Rinburg to try to help with the lake monster. Either they never passed through Rinburg (so didn't know about it, i.e. if they came over the Enst on the west side of Eftly and/or in between Eftly and Rinburg) or they felt someone else was doing it and agreed to split up.


[3/28/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess where I'm going with this is my feeling is Armand would probably not head west away from Fellburn, upon hearing news of big undead siege there, unless he is explicitly going to get help for Fellburn, or he can't get to Fellburn because of dangers on the road or something like that


[3/28/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but not sure enough about the timeline of what is happening where to propose a coherent "last two weeks" itinerary for him


[3/28/2024 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
I suspect the best story for him is that he is actually trying to get to Fellburn


[3/28/2024 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
He was - for whatever reason - west of Eftly when the undead starting rising. He might not have even heard about the siege of Fellburn at first, as the ghast-creature in Eftly was cutting off most news from the east


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
why did Vaihaya turn west from Eftly instead of east towards Rinburg?


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
So they'd run into my PCs? Duh 😄


[3/28/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
well obviously


[3/28/2024 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
Realistically, I suspect Vahaiya was basing themselves in Champimont. So it is a return-to-base and regroup


[3/28/2024 2:55 PM] .deciusmus
It's only 6 miles to Eftly, so reasonable to defeat the monster, return to Champimont for a long rest/restock, then head out


[3/28/2024 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
what is happening on the Wistel? are there undead there too or confined to the south?


[3/28/2024 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
Here's the full set of outbreaks:

The major clusters are:
* Fellburn skeletal army, emerges Jan 6th - 7th overnight, crawls and forms and reforms, some people flee and die Battle of Stavenford / Battle of Fellburn, (largest mass of undead)
* Eskbridge Far east near Tyrwingha 4th - 5th is (big)
* Borderlands all 3, 5 clusters total, mostly small, local devastation and local heroics (maybe doesn't happen)
* Rinburg 6th - 7th emerges in lake (giant eel thing only, minimal actual undead)
* Aveil hills, emerges 4th - 5th (small)
* Ainwick emerges 5th - 6th bandit zombies (big))
* Cleenseau 4th - 5th second one 7th (small)
* Dunmore 4th - 5th (small)
* Enford 6th - 7th (small)
* Gowerborne Wis 2 - 5th - 6th, (big)

Although not 100% of those are canonical


[3/28/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
It is isolated to south of the Wistel for the most part; the only case I have of an outbreak beyond the Wistel is in the Aine Hills


[3/28/2024 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing near Embry, or really outside the Dunfry - Aveil - Wisford section other than the one outbreak in the Aine Hills


[3/28/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
The ones that I'm sure about are

Gowerbourne, on the Wistel, but the outbreak is actually inland. This is where the Duke of WIsford is now (although he is heading to Fellburn)

Fellburn.

Aveil Hills (but this is small)

Aine Hills (this is distracting the Army of the West)

Enford (small)


[3/28/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
(plus the stuff in Rinburg and Cleenseau, although none of that is very big)


[3/28/2024 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
I'm leaning toward the Borderlands one being not real (I didn't even hint at it in game) and the Eskbridge one being just false rumors


[3/28/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
(I'm in a meeting, responses might be slow)


[3/28/2024 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
So here is roughly what I would propose for Armand. Timing not precise and needs checking with travel times. 

Early Dec sometime (5-6 weeks ago, per your comment in Armand's obisidan note), he left Embry based on bad premonitions about undead and such. Reaches Wisford and then heads upriver, towards Gowerbourne and eventually aiming for Ainwick. This could be (a) on orders of the temple in Embry, if there is an organized effort to send people investigating premonitions; (b) because he knows someone he wants to connect with, someone with Night Queen connections he feels might have insight; (c) perhaps because of dreams / visions. Probably (b) is cleanest but I don't know the relevant context.

It is ~250 miles from Wisford to Ainwick, so say is not pushing hard and gets there in ~2 weeks, mid/late December. Spends Pyravela in Ainwick. 

It is only 50-60 miles from Ainwick to the Aveil Hills, so when rumors reach him in Ainwick (maybe Jan 6-7) of undead, he heads south, hurrying, reaching Aveil Hills perhaps in 2 days, by Jan 8-9.  (*note this requires delaying the emergence of Ainwick undead so he has left by the time they emerge, or deciding this didn't happen)

In Aslain, rumors are flying about all kinds of badness, mostly to the south, so he heads south. At this point, probably trying to get to Fellburn and help there, but hears of the lake monster in Rinburg and does not think he can face it alone, so swings west to gather news and hopefully allies. 

At that point, either meets Vahaiya and their crew in Eftly and helps with the monster there, or ends up in Champimont looking for news and allies heading east.


[3/28/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
Fleshing out a bit more, I would say it probably makes the most sense if:
(a) Armand left mostly on his own, not sent on a mission, largely just feeling restless and sure something bad was coming, and was aiming for Ainwick or some place near there, where he knew someone, an old friend, perhaps not a human - I am imagining basically a kind of recluse / hermit but who Armand would trust to have a sense of the land, corruption. probably not someone dedicated to the Night Queen, more like a druid-type, or a centaur, or maybe a halfling
(b) There was not an undead attack on Ainwick, so that Armand isn't tempted to turn back; there could have been outbreaks downriver between Ainwick and Gowerborne, or rumors could be confused


[3/28/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think it works better if he is local to Aveil in the Jan 5-8th timeframe. What if instead of going up the Wistel, he ends up in Aveil. Same idea (seeking a recluse/hermit type) but this person lives in the eastern eaves of the Cleenseau Wood, a bit upriver from Aslain say


[3/28/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
For him, the undead outbreak starts with a few zombies arising in the village next door, or whatever, and for ~3-4 days he is busy in the local area around  just helping folks.

Around Jan 10th he hears of 
(a) some trouble in the Aveil Hills
(b) the siege of Fellburn

And he dithers for a bit but ultimately is compelled to head towards Fellburn. He heads south along the Auberonne


[3/28/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
But before he reaches Rinburng, he gets pulled along a series of villages with problems and ends up finding it faster to get back on track by heading due south from some village west of the Auberonne, which puts him smack into Eftly.

He basically runs into Vahayia and their group hunting the ghast just outside Eftly


[3/28/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that works. the exact route doesn't matter too much


[3/28/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Right. It is helpful from a "not needing to decide everything" if his knowledge base is mostly local, not far away


[3/28/2024 4:56 PM] .deciusmus
Did we decide when the next holiday is, btw? We were talking about a "end of the not travelling season" type holiday in mid-late Jan


[3/28/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think anything was ever made canon on that front


[3/29/2024 10:31 AM] rsulfuratus
think Armand is basically done. I might make a different image if I feel like it, but if not yours is fine. still needs a magic item, if you have ideas, and might switch lucky feat for resilient con

I'll look when I get a chance


[3/29/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
there seems to be a bug in the python site export code...
 A line like this: 
| ![[assets/ring-of-wounding.png\|240]]           | [[Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Treasure/Ring of Wounding.md\|Ring of Wounding]]                         | ring  | [Reference](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8244293-ring-of-wounding)             |

becomes

i.e. the image and external links are fixed correctly but the internal link doesn't get slugifying (although it does not formatted)


[3/29/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
figured it out


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
although I don't know the fix


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
the issue is:

[[Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Treasure/Ring of Wounding.md|Ring of Wounding]]


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
that type of link (to the full filename) doesn't work


[3/29/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
but that is what dataview generates for the "link" function


[3/29/2024 4:56 PM] rsulfuratus
this is a weird one


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
I think I have a fix


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i tentatively suspect windows/mac confusion


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
the issue is the ".md"


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
you have a block in export_vault


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
with the comment
 ## check to see if we have a broken obsidian path
                 # this is not the best way to do this


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that is what I'm looking at - that is where this should hit


[3/29/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
the link ends with .md\


[3/29/2024 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
so the parts has as last part

Silverthorwn.md\ for example


[3/29/2024 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
but that isn't in self.path_dict, because the actual file ended up in as Silverthorwn


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
no .md


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
do you mean it ends .md, or .md\?


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
sorrry or .md\\?


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
I believe the 2nd one


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
where does the extra `\` come from?


[3/29/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
here is the parts:
['Campaigns', 'Cleenseau Campaign', 'Treasure', 'Chest of the Forest Guardian.md\\']


[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
I am not sure


[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
Ah


[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
it is because it is in a dataview table


[3/29/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
so dataview adds \ to escape the |


[3/29/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
should just be able to flip the order of the rstrip and the replace then


[3/29/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
the actual line is:

| ![[assets/chest-of-forest-guardian.png\|240]]   | [[Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Treasure/Chest of the Forest Guardian.md\|Chest of the Forest Guardian]] | chest | [Reference](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8244307-chest-of-the-forest-guardian) |


[3/29/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
the actual line is:

```| ![[assets/chest-of-forest-guardian.png\|240]]   | [[Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Treasure/Chest of the Forest Guardian.md\|Chest of the Forest Guardian]] | chest | [Reference](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8244307-chest-of-the-forest-guardian) |
```


[3/29/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
what fixed it for me was:

```-                if parts[-1] in self.path_dict:
-                    alias = str(parts[-1]) if alias == "" else alias
+                final_part = self.remove_trailing_backslash(parts[-1])
+                if final_part.endswith(".md"):
+                    final_part = os.path.splitext(final_part)[0]
```


[3/29/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
and then using final_part instead of parts[-1] in the rest of the block


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
wait where does self.remove_trailing_backslash come from? did you add that too?


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
it comes from chatgpt


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
```
    def remove_trailing_backslash(self, string):
        if string.endswith("\\"):
            return string[:-1]
        return string
```


[3/29/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
rstrip does that


[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
I don't see rstrip in the code though


[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] rsulfuratus
`clean_name = parts[-1].replace('.md', '').rstrip("\\/")`


[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
ah, sure


[3/29/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
your code might be better than chat gpt's


[3/29/2024 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
I just asked it how to remove a trailing "\\"


[3/29/2024 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
chat gpt didn't know about rstrip


[3/29/2024 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
what I'm slightly confused by is as I understand it the order shouldn't matter, replace then rstrip or rstrip then replace


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
I don't know what you are looking at


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
so there might be something else wrong with my code


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
`clean_name = parts[-1].replace('.md', '').rstrip("\\/")`


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, wait


[3/29/2024 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think I have that version!

started working a bit on reorg of cosmology/religion, see religion-refactor branch. significant work-in-progress at the moment, major goal is to separate gods/religious practice better (especially for non-humans) and also merge all the various pages for the Divine Presence (Arhat/Malik etc)


[4/1/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
opened PR to merge religion / gods reorg into main when you have a chance to look

👍

[4/1/2024 4:54 PM] .deciusmus
looked at it briefly; I didn't review the status/mike stuff but the structure seems sensible. you should go ahead and merge it


[4/1/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
Kiya (Celyn's player) asked why Sembarans are distrustful of magic, anyhing you'd add / change about the below (haven't sent it yet):

There is no one event or specific reason why wizards are distrusted in Sembara, but there is a long cultural tradition dating back hundreds of years that is suspicious of "learned magic" and in particular magic as something you study and unpack how it works and then use that knowledge to make more of it. Where exactly it developed none of you would know, but since the Great War, a number of events have occurred that enforce and seem to confirm the suspicion. The most notable was the story of Elaine I and her twin sister Anne, which is long and tragic and something I will write up in more detail sometime - but in is briefest form there was a contest for the throne between Elaine and Anne, and in the course of that contest Anne studied magic deeply so she could learn to cast a powerful geas to force Elaine to give up the throne. This ended up failing (was found out, and undone) but it was seen as a confirmation of the worst things about wizards. The year after Anne's treachery was the Cursed Cold, when for five months fire radiated cold, not heat, and the days grew colder, not warmer, as the sun rose. This devastated the areas it impacted (cooking and growing crops are both hard without heat) and was seen by many as somehow related to Anne's treachery and a cost the entire kingdom bore for her magic. 

(There is also the story of how Drankor fell, 700-ish years ago - a red mist that spread throughout the land killing millions - supposedly caused by the mages of Drankor, somehow - Drankor was obsessed as a civilization with understanding magic, or so it is said).


[4/1/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
More broadly, there are other similar cultural stories that share the message: magic is something to worship, or be in awe of, or philosophize about, marvel at, accept as a gift, etc but studying how it works, unpicking the central mystery is seen as dangerous (choosing to mess around with forces you can't ever really understand), potentially nefarious (too many stories of research or other deep delving into the secrets of magic leading to corruption and evil, i.e. no one thinks Anne in the story above started out bad), and in some cases, a little bit sacreligious (magic is a gift of the Sibyl, trying to learn magic is like trying to force your way into her good graces - that said, in Tollen the Sibyl is the patron of the university of magic, so this isn't a universal interpretation of her).

It wouldn't be right to oversell the prejudice either. Wizards are not hunted on sight, or anything like that. But many emigrate, i.e. to Tollen or Chardon, where magic is more accepted, and there are not many teachers, etc so they end up being rarer than other types of magic users. Interestingly, a wild magic sorcerer doesn't encounter the same prejudice, even though they may literally be dangerous to those around them - to a Sembaran, they were born with their magic, and so it isn't them choosing to be dangerous by delving into deep secrets. 
These are broadly Tyrwinghan beliefs as well, although in Tyrwingha there would be the added wrinkle of the fey. Famously, Ethlenn wanted to learn Drankorian magical secrets, and that plays into this idea that exploring the deep secrets of how magic works is too dangerous for mortals, and is best left to the fey.


[4/1/2024 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is basically right. One minor detail I would change is that the University in Tollen is not really a "magic university", and indeed the study of magic is a pretty minor part of the scholarship and learning at the university. Tollen is a lot more open and accepting of magic that Sembara, but there is a pretty strong contrast between e.g. Chardon and Tollen in terms of just how much organized magic you see walking around.


[4/1/2024 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I would also add that it isn't so much that wizards are hunted on sight or anything (they aren't), but that scholarly organizations and secret societies dedicated to the study of magic just never really get established in Sembara and are fairly strongly discouraged. So a lone wizard in their tower taking an appentice might be seen as a bit dangerous, a bit eccentic, but not someone you'd drive out of town; while something like the Society of the Open Scroll would be at a minimum forced underground if not outright driven out


[4/1/2024 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
Finally I think the Tyrwinghan belief that probing the deep secrets of arcane magic is too dangerous for mortals and best left to the fey is a fairly common feeling across Sembara, probably spreading from Tyrwingha to some extent


[4/1/2024 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that all makes sense. This is in the context of an NPC they met, a wizard in Rinburg, who led, and is being blamed for the failure of, the first attempt to kill the lake monster


[4/1/2024 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
So the vibe has beeen a bit of prejudice and quickness to judge, i.e. it is clearly her fault. But also not like people are trying to drive her out of time or anything (and clearly she was powerful/important enough that she was in a position to help led the previous assault)


[4/1/2024 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think part of the vibe is that arcane magic is quite dangerous and quick to go wrong, which seems like it fits well. This probably develops even more strongly after all the fallout of the weird magic during the blood years in sembara and then the whole Elaine and Anne thing


[4/1/2024 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
do you think random PCs would know who the 3 despairs are?


[4/1/2024 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I’m not sure. Originally I have kind of thought of that as elven lore but also not sure what is gained by keeping them secret?


[4/1/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
(I am writing another play-by-email scene) and this wizard, who is obsessed with transformation, definitely knows of them, and is going to mention one of her nightmares is the werewolves of the Mad One (i.e forced transformation). Just trying to decide how much to meta-explain vs wait for them to ask about.

I think in general I'm going to wait for them to ask I think it is kinda reasonable that any relatively learned person might have read of them (i.e. say Armand) but a 23 year old Tyrwinghan farmboy probably not


[4/1/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think that makes sense. There would be rumors and lore that is accessible in world to generally learned knowledgable people but they are not default knowledge


[4/2/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
So I introduced this divine soul sorcerer of the Sibyl, who is fascinated by magic and has kicked off a conversation with my PCs about the philosophy of magic (in a play-by-email exchange we are going to do over the next 2ish weeks). 

Do you have any interest in being part of it, either as Tristan (the sorcerer) or Armand? 

There is nothing “game/plot” related it’s just going to be people asking Tristan what he knows about different kinds of magic


[4/2/2024 8:15 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that seems fun


[4/2/2024 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
Btw, all I have on Tristan is in obsidian. He has some mysterys (i.e. this He grew up in Tyrwingha, in Tafolwern, he says, but in the course of your talking about home, he talks about one of his earliest memories, the birth of Cece I's youngest daughter - which happened 57 years ago).

I was vaguely thinking he spent some time in the feywild, but any explanation you come up with for that, if it comes up, would be fine


[4/3/2024 10:04 AM] rsulfuratus
what do you think of an eight-pointed seedling as a holy symbol of the mother? something kind of like: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1225080386766508075/1225083334397267998/rsulfuratus_Design_a_straightforward_and_iconic_symbol_for_a_fa_c42bfe41-365d-4031-8c22-17c2dd330294.png?ex=661fd6c3&is=660d61c3&hm=4298323e1fd2ebcbb21b45f9a333a632ef5ade66bf9e4679adebc47b57693e8f&

waiting for someone to show up to a meeting they booked on my calendar, and looking at random pages tagged needswork. Curious what you think about this - working on Sibyl's Hall, which is basically an undergrad college of the University of Chardon. It is functionally both a place and an organization. It seems a bit silly to have two pages, one for the academic organization and another for the physical infrastructure. but also not sure we want to start tagging things with multiple categories (e.g., both place and organization) as that would cause unpredictable errors in the javascript code imo


[4/3/2024 3:31 PM] .deciusmus
I think tagging both is probably wrong. Either:
- just create a page for the organization and don’t have a page for the building (ie have the organization page just say “Based out of Sibyl’s Hall in the university… but don’t link it)
- actually have both pages with slightly different content


[4/3/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
I do a fair bit of #1, ie if I’m making up a small village I won’t necessarily make pages for all the people.


[4/3/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
Sibyls hall could just be text on the main university of Chardon page

yeah, okay, going to keep that, was just messing around with a few other variants


[4/4/2024 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the context by which Tristan and your players ended up sitting down in an inn together?


[4/4/2024 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
meant to ask earlier


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
So Tristan and Vahayia and bunch of other rangers just killed a ghast in Eftly


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
The PCs were also heading toward Eftly to fight the ghast


[4/4/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
(Note -
Ghast was giant growing thing much worse than regular ghast)


[4/4/2024 9:17 PM] .deciusmus
PCs showed up in Champimont (the biggest town between Rinburg and Cleenseau, but still small) when a big party was going on, basically a celebration/outpouring of relief because the rangers had killed the ghast


[4/4/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
The PCs and rangers all ended up in the same inn, and met, and spent some time talking and planning together. About who goes where next to deal with various remaining undead bits


[4/4/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
This scene is after the planning part, when half the rangers have gone to bed and the remaining are staying up talking


[4/4/2024 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
They are in a private back room and the three magically interested PCs and Tristan end up talking


[4/4/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so Tristan has heard the PCs talk about magic and what they can do, but not actually seen them fight?


[4/4/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
Right. He saw Viepuck cast a good berry spell and disguise self but both were odd - Viepucks patron is some kind of Far Realm alien mind and the disguise self is psionic-vibey


[4/4/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
(Game mechanically it is written as a projection so it only works on sentient creatures but in world reason for this is not clear)


[4/4/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
But otherwise just stories, although the players told their story about fighting undead so he’d know about their types of magic.


[4/5/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
cleaning up some status tags and ran into an issue. Bas Udda was burned down by gnolls in April 1748, but resettled in Nov 1748. having a created date later than destroyed date breaks things.

I think best option here is just to use campaign info for this, instead of created/destroyed, but curious what you think


[4/5/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
I think having a block in the body of the text like

%%^Date:1748%%
In April of 1748... and in Nov of 1748
%%^End%%

And then not set the created destroyed (or set the created to the "original foundation")


[4/5/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
If you want lines to appear in the header, campaign info I guess is fine but I've become less of a fan of a lot of header lines


[4/5/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess Bas Udda is a bit of a weird case since the destruction and resettlement are both in the past. 

the general case though is that if taelgarverse in its current form had existed in 3 years ago or whenever, I'd want the page to be "Burned by gnolls on XX date"


[4/5/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe trying to put it all in the header is not that useful


[4/5/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
but I think I'd not overly worry about the non-existent game that is taking place in May 1748


[4/5/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
like, if Taelgarverse had existing back then, you could have changed the page to be "burned by gnolls" and then updated it when it was resettled to no longer say "burned by gnolls" and have text instead


[4/5/2024 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
right. I guess that is the general solution, if a place is resettled just delete the destroyed date from the header and move to text


[4/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
right


[4/5/2024 4:44 PM] .deciusmus
that doesn't work though if the resettlement is in the future compared to an active game


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
I think at some level worrying about the abstraction of "taelgarverse has to be able to reflect exactly what is happening on a specific random date" is too much trouble


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, like if Rinburg were destroyed by zombies in your game


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
Well I have a live example, Eftly, the little town that was destroyed by undead


[4/5/2024 4:45 PM] .deciusmus
But realistically, no one cares or has even decided if it gets resettled


[4/5/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
so it doesn't matter that on your taelgarverse it shows upa s "destroyed by a ghast creature, 1720"


[4/5/2024 4:47 PM] .deciusmus
But if in a year we are hunting clues about the Isingue acid monster and you want to reuse a bunch of the Enst valley stuff rather than setting the clue hunting somewhere else, it could in theory be a problem


[4/5/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point I actually looked a bit at basically abstracting the whereabouts logic to essentially every header piece of information


[4/5/2024 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
In theory I don't think it would be that hard to either introduce the idea ofa "Second life", i.e. say a page can have
created/destroyed/born/died
recreated/redestroyed/reborn/reallykilled


[4/5/2024 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
that could also work for undead, as an aside


[4/5/2024 4:49 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think the most robust way to do it would be to abstract whereabouts logic to page existence


[4/5/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
or, alternatively, allow created to be after destroyed, and handle that as a special case (i.e. it isn't really destroyed for age/existance stuff, but you show the destroyed line)


[4/5/2024 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
or alternatively try to do something generic but I 'm not sure how whereabouts logic abstracts, actually


[4/5/2024 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
because there is no "location"


[4/5/2024 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
location is just a binary. exists/doesn't


[4/5/2024 4:50 PM] rsulfuratus
or, rather, exists or unknown, with unknown meaning dead


[4/5/2024 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
so a person born in 1650, killed in 1700, resurrected in 1744 would be someting like:
- home, 1650
- away, 1700
- home, 1774


[4/5/2024 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
current whereabouts logic would set location to "home" for 1650-1700, unknown for 1700-1744, and home from 1744-current


[4/5/2024 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
home = alive, unknown = dead


[4/5/2024 4:53 PM] rsulfuratus
would want to abstract it a bit so that we don't use home/away keywords and don't have a location and such


[4/5/2024 4:54 PM] rsulfuratus
but I'm pretty sure it would work=


[4/5/2024 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
right, I see what you mean


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
something like
existance:
- { type: exist, start: 1650, end: 1700 }
- { type: exist, start: 1744 }


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
you could then add "startStatus"  / "endStatus"


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah something like that


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
actually I don't thik you need type or the concept of away at


[4/5/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
no, you wouldn't, i forgot about end:


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
use the same whereabouts logic but just for "home"


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
and "last known"


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
so basically you get the home and/or last know


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right, if you have a home, you are alive. if not, you died at last known date


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] rsulfuratus
(alive = exist)


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
if you have a home, you are "alive" with a start status of start and an age of end - start
if you don't have a home, you are "dead", with a start status of start, age of end, etc


[4/5/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, what you said


[4/5/2024 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
would actually be a way to deal with mirror people, better than whereabouts if the age calculations excluded periods of being dead


[4/5/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking the age would always basically be from "current" start to end


[4/5/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
that works better for places, for example


[4/5/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. Eftly, founded 1689, destroyed 1720, refounded 1730, if you wanted to calc the age it would be since refounding, I think


[4/5/2024 5:05 PM] rsulfuratus
yes. but for people it is a bit weird. someone who was dead and resurrected 1 year ago is not 1 year old


[4/5/2024 5:05 PM] .deciusmus
true


[4/5/2024 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
although for undead it might make sense to say something like

died in xxx at age y, arose as a vampire in z (10 years ago)


[4/5/2024 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[4/5/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
probably easiest to start with just calculating age of the most recent period of existence, and then if someone wanted to fiddle could add a parsing token to age that would indicate total age (sum all existence intervals) instead of last age. which might be a little tricky


[4/5/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
anwyay, not going to do anything about it now but worth keeping in mind


[4/5/2024 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
yup

Sketching out a ton of new places for next Dunmar session on Thursday. Mostly expecting you'll learn about it in game but want a second opinion on a bunch of names. 

(this is the northern part of the peninsula, extending northwest from the canal - divided into three provinces in the Chardonian Empire)

Portalia (province around the canal, originally derives from Drankorian for passage)
Nevium (north end of canal city)
Pergia (south end of canal city)
Artevus (another city in this province)

Cedrano (next province to northwest, name derives from the largest river, Kedron, which is an old Northros / Northerner name)
Castrella (provincial capital)
Ombraforte (village or town)

Tamaris (final province, name derives from name for the peninsula, the Tamaro Peninsula; see below for alternatives)
Roccena (roc-CHE-na, provincial capital)
Tenze (TEN-tseh, city/town)
Antissus (city/town)
Sarvia (city/town)
Silbana (river)

Alternative peninsula names:
Maravio (province is Maravium)
Raziano (province in Razianium)

Other city/town/village names:
Telumis
Serraventia
Canophris


[4/27/2024 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
I like the general vibe. Prefer Raziano to Tamaro slightly but really either seems good. Don’t love Maravio


[4/27/2024 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
The end of the session tomorrow might be the breaking of the siege of Fellburn, which in my head is highlighted by a couple of powerful npcs. Do you think say a 15th lvl cleric, a 13th level paladin, and two 11th level clerics is too much magical force for the Duke of Wisford to have brought together?


[4/27/2024 7:08 PM] rsulfuratus
IMO yes


[4/27/2024 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
I haven't thought super carefully about it, but in general I've tended to not create NPCs who can cast higher than 5th level spells, unless they are supposed to be basically the most powerful people in a kingdom


[4/27/2024 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it breaks worldbuilding a bit if there are non-PCs who have that much magic. Or I guess rather non-adventurers, counting both PCs and villians


[4/27/2024 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
Isn’t it implausible that there are no super high level clerics in sembara at all though?


[4/27/2024 7:15 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn’t sure about the number — ie would say 3 of the 8 most powerful clerics in sembara really be at this battle. But it seems like there should be say 8-10 clerics of 10+ level, right? I guess maybe half that makes more sense


[4/27/2024 7:15 PM] rsulfuratus
based on this with a population of 25 million (which might be high for Sembara - France in 1500 was more like 15 million), there would be perhaps as many as 13 clerics of level 9+

(Zs show is about to start so I’ll probably stop responding in a min)


[4/27/2024 7:17 PM] rsulfuratus
a 15th level cleric would likely be the most powerful magic user in Sembara - so I guess the question is, would the most powerful magic user in Sembara be at the seige of Fellburn?


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] rsulfuratus
at one point (in same spreadsheet) we had calculated about 12 milliion humans in Sembara. So that would imply something like 4 of the 6 most power magic users showing up at Fellburn


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
Right that’s too much


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
Probably should be 11th and 9th or something


[4/27/2024 7:20 PM] .deciusmus
More later


[4/27/2024 8:07 PM] .deciusmus
So I think I’d revise to have one 13th or so level powerful cleric and then a couple of 7th levels. Plus a 9th or 10th level paladin.


[4/27/2024 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
The 13th probably is one of the 3-4 most powerful casters in sembara (although the spreadsheet suggests about 15 level 9+ casters in sembara)


[4/27/2024 8:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that seems sensible


[4/27/2024 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
Actually maybe 11th. Just need them to be high enough level to cast forbiddance


[4/27/2024 8:10 PM] rsulfuratus

I got sucked into a rabbit hole about the Villa of Papyri (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_of_the_Papyri) and then reading about the transition from papyrus scrolls to parchment manuscripts and the massive impact that tastes in the 7th and 8th centuries had on what Greek and Roman literature survived into the middle ages and thus to the modern day. 

Which made me wonder about Taelgar's document tradition and its impact on what survives now. I haven't given it much thought, but for example do the elves have parchment or paper from the beginning? When do humans on Hkar develop parchment and books?

Partially just idle thoughts, but partially matters for e.g. set dressing for Drankor. Are there lots of ancient books lying around in Drankor carried over from Hkar, for example? Is catastrophes the main source of knowledge loss, or do you have the same kind of document decay as in the real world, or some combination? 

Just kind of curious meanderings, in case you have any thoughts.

I don’t have any really detailed thoughts but I did introduce the idea of a “lost manuscript” from Drankor that survives only in a fragment embedded in a review of a play


[5/7/2024 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
Which was intentionally modeled on how Romans quoted other works which in turn sometimes survived when the original work was lost

[5/7/2024 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
I do think there are a lot of catastrophies though - so there is no clear need for document decay per se.


[5/7/2024 8:19 PM] .deciusmus
I imagine a fairly literate population - enough to sustain a post/messenger system and have court records, military dispatches, etc be common.

Quick thought on holidays...

the pared with Vitalae "leave taking" holiday on Jan 22, six weeks after Vitalae.

struggling a bit with names. Quintara or Quintarum was one idea


[5/29/2024 9:19 PM] .deciusmus
thoughts?


[7/7/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
Idea for refactoring items, based on thinking about magic items in Taelgar.

1) Magic items are typically created based on using specific semi-magical objects to bind/capture extraplanar energy, typically much easier at an extraplanar weak point. In general, this means that to create a magic item, you generally need to know the formula, in some ways analgous to spells.

2) Magic items have the same power law as spellcasters, so most magic items are common, and very few are exceptionally strong. However, while all artifacts have some kind of story, that doesn't mean a common item can't have a story. 

Separately a mechanical level, there is a reason to make the world conform to some general D&D rules. Most non-legendary, non-artifact magic items in D&D sourcebooks shouldn't be unique mechanically Taelgar, and the lore of magic items should have it make sense that certain items tend to be easy to find.


[7/7/2024 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
From this I can think of a few things that are maybe worth thinking about.

1) Some items -- Drankorian Sending Stones; Skaer masterwork weapons; Lakan monastery extradimensional storage -- have "standard" D&D mechanics (mostly) but are in-world part of a specific workshop tradition. These feel interesting and useful to track


[7/7/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
So far in my game the basic pattern has been… 

Most items are fairly similar to specific D&D items, but often not in the exact form..

Ie a ring that has the same game effect as a pearl of power (rather than a pearl)

Also, I’ve usually made up some brief history even for “common” magic items, and I haven’t shied away from simple made up items, i.e an amulet with three stones each of which heals


[7/7/2024 3:57 PM] .deciusmus
(You can see this in my Cleenseau treasure folder)


[7/7/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
2) Some items -- a pearl of power is a good example -- are well known formula that recur, but at least so far are not things that come from a "workshop tradition". But these are not explicitly unique items, and would in world be broadly considered "the same" from an arcane perspective


[7/7/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
3) Some items are truly unique. They are creations that you wouldn't expect to see again, and have some unique creation story. Some of these are powerful artifacts (Ring of Undying, e.g.), others might be less powerful but still unique (Delwath's shield, naragil)


[7/7/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
Note that one might reuse the mechanics of a unique item in some circumstances, but from an in world mechanical perspective it would be a different formula in some sense


[7/7/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
The lore thing I'm most interested in is the distinction between 1 and 2.

In an obsidian context, I would likely want to always have a page for (1) and (3). 
(a) a page for "Drankorian sending stones" but not pages for each representative, unless there was meaningful history to track
(b) a page for any item in category #3
(c) a page for any item in category #2 that had


[7/7/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
oops that was a bit garbled


[7/7/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea is you'd make pages for (1) and (3) always, but only for individual representatives of (1) or (2) if the story warranted it


[7/7/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
but I'm not sure if this matches with your magic item creation workflow


[7/7/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
I’ve had a tendency to assume that magic items are very hard to destroy and haven’t thought much about how they come to be


[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right your players haven't asked for custom magic powers on their flying castle yet I presume


[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
By that I mean I thought more about the history


[7/7/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
Ie a Drankorian shield that was unearthed or a Sembaran war hammer that was buried with a knight or whatever


[7/7/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
Magic items have mostly had a specific “ancient” source in my game so far


[7/7/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
But I think the general ideas you outlined make sense, except I think I’ve leaned into a little bit more creativity and likelihood for group #2


[7/7/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think in that context your magic items are much "cleaner" from an obisidian point of view. if each item has a clear history then it likely deserves its own page (if only for campaign notes type info) and how it was created doesn't necessarily matter.


[7/7/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
but you guys have a lot of magic items without a clear history, or just vague notes about who created it (since by default that is the easiest thing to improvise in the mirror if I at least know where and when it was created)


[7/7/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Right. From a notes perspective your division makes sense


[7/7/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
for example I will probably make a page for the Urskan monster part trade but not make individual pages for everything you bought in the market in Zvervinka


[7/7/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Also it is probably useful to think about some common archetypes, other than bags of holding / sending stones / Skaer weapons


[7/7/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Yes this makes a lot of sense to me

Going to think about this a bit -- if Kate is into her book I might work on item refactor tonight


[7/7/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
I think I wouldn’t necessarily assume the D&D rules are exactly the common formulas though. Ie I introduced an amulet with one-time healing abilities which was described as an embodied miracle of the Mother passed down as a family heirloom. I can imagine things like that being common-ish in Sembara


[7/7/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
right, it doesn't have to strictly connect to mechanics or D&D sourcebooks


[7/7/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
But actually thinking about those categories helps refine items. For example
Boots of false tracks are pretty common. Why? Could be fun to make up and then just make a page for the general item


[7/7/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[7/7/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
some could be just that weak effects are easy to create, but others could be a specific reason. e.g, the Dunmari army during the Dharajun Dynasty made a large number of horn of silent alarms and so they are commonly found around Dumar and typically date to the Great War and immediately pre-Great War era

doing a major rework of items. kind of into it. pushing as I go in case you are interested.

one question: I assume you don't really care if you can figure out what items I have backstory invented for. my plan is to significantly trim secrets, and generally make pages for anything that has a notable secret even if the item itself might not otherwise warrant a page.


[7/7/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
no, I don't care

I like both


[7/11/2024 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't quite done, but the magic item rework in obsidian is shaping to do the following:
1) make pages for everything that is either (a) a specific item, whether unique or not, with a story; or (b) a generic class of items, such as "Drankorian message stones" or "dragonhide armor"
2) move all secrets for the Dunmar campaign to individual item pages or to "hoard pages", which would be the summary of all the items from a particular adventure or arc
3) clean up party treasure to be easier to read and edit

one issue so far is that we currently don't have a clear way to distinguish between types of items and specific items. currently this is just by folder, with things/magic items being generic things that have many copies in the world (workshop items from previous discussion), and things/artifacts of power or dunmar frontier/treasure/notable items having unique things (whether actually unique or historically/lore unique).

not sure if there is a better way to do this


[7/11/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
there probably is but I don't have time to think about it this week


[7/11/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
realistically, for "item types" you probably don't have whereabouts, creator, etc


[7/11/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
but also, if you just don't set them, then... fine


[7/11/2024 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus

[7/12/2024 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
I've been playing around a bit with https://dicecloud.com/ as an alternative to D&D Beyond (because I find homebrewing in D&D beyond annoying and my players have a bit of an anti-WOTC vibe, so we were talking about alternatives)...

And it got me thinking about languages a little bit. In my game, I have a house rule that makes it much easier to have new languages and learn new languages, so I was thinking refactoring the language docs a bit


[7/12/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
the idea would be to
(a) rewrite the Species/Languages doc to be more "in-world" but include the "real-world mappings" where they are relatively canonical
(b) potentially create a Mechanics/Language Rules that defines which sets of languages are "related" for D&D language purposes

(the ultimate goal would be to let my players select languages from the full set in Species/Languages, i.e. I'm sure that Celyn (kiya's PC) speaks both Tyrwinghan and Sembaran...)


[7/12/2024 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah there is definitely a bit of tension in the current doc between mechanics and in-world lore


[7/12/2024 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that seems worthwhile


[7/12/2024 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
to be honest though I'm not sure that I find languages mechanically very interesting - your party always seems to complain when you can't speak to people and it usually just doesn't seem to be worth the hassle


[7/12/2024 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
which might suggest it would be worthwhile to actually be a bit broader about language groupings - e.g. if you understand any of the post-Drankorian languages you can understand all of them


[7/12/2024 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
Languages are mechanically more interesting when they are easier to learn


[7/12/2024 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
My complaint with D&D languages is not that they exist but that by RAW you cannot ever learn new ones. I made a house rule where you can learn a new language every other level


[7/12/2024 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
But there is an alternative where it just doesn’t make sense to distinguish other than between broad language families


[7/12/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
My intention in the doc is have language families well defined “in world” (and probably at 2 levels) so it would be easy to have a mechanic that says D&D language X is all languages I. family Y


[7/12/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus

[7/12/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
What language do you think Tollenders speak natively?


[7/12/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
Sembaran? Something else?


[7/12/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
probably Sembaran, right?


[7/12/2024 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, Sembaran


[7/12/2024 2:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I think in practice you'd actually have both Sembara and Tollen speaking in the modern day a kind of Sembar-Tollish mix, that has Drankorian, Tyrwinghan, and Skaer influences


[7/12/2024 2:19 PM] .deciusmus
I've actually structured Sembaran names as pretty French/English mix, so it kinda works to have Sembaran be a more blended language, with a lot of loan words from a Germanic (Eastros) and a Romance (Westros)


[7/12/2024 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
I'm less sure about Tyrwinghan influence. I see Tyrwinghan as kinda like modern Welsh or Irish -- most people speak Sembaran, it kinda surives in backwaters but didn't have a ton of influence on the larger devellopment of Sembaran


[7/12/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but where does Tyrwinghan come from? I always imagined it as "old" - e.g. retaining some mariner elements


[7/12/2024 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
Although historically, it is more than it surived as an ancient tongue during the Drankorian years, and I think the "Tyrwinghan Drankorian" and the "Sembaran Drankorian" evolved together into "Sembaran"


[7/12/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so more similar perhaps to Skaer than anything else


[7/12/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
while some people in Tyrwinghan still speak the ancient language as well


[7/12/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
or maybe only


[7/12/2024 2:22 PM] rsulfuratus
but pre-Drankor, I think the "northern mariners" which are basically Tyrwingha, Skaer, and Highlanders are all speaking probably similar-ish languages, aren't they?


[7/12/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
yes, although I'm not sure if it is necessary to decide if Tyrwinghan has some unique influence.


[7/12/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, of course


[7/12/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Kiya has gotten into the "its Welsh" so that's pretty canon at this point. Welsh has a nice property of being Indo-European but neither Germanic/Slavic (which is my model for Eastros) nor Romance (for Westros).

But also the mapping from Taelgar to human languages doesn't have to be exactly perfect in terms of language families.

In general, I've tried to leave undecided the question of who exactly the ancient Tyrwinghans were


[7/12/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Also is Skaer and Zimvoka really similar? I thought of Zimkova as Northern not Eastern


[7/12/2024 2:25 PM] rsulfuratus
yes the original naming Tyrwingha is very Welsh influenced


[7/12/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess Zimkova is fairly northern, yes. it is more Vostok that is mixed, but I think Tollen would fall into the kind of "mixed northern/mariner" lineage when originally settled


[7/12/2024 2:27 PM] .deciusmus
the language in the western green sea is actually kinda complex, as it is the only place I think where we have a melting pot of all 3 major (defined) human exoduses from Hkar


[7/12/2024 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[7/12/2024 2:29 PM] .deciusmus
there probably should be an ancient tongue that was once spoken in the coastlands of the western green sea that was derived from Eastros/Northern tongue


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
I think actually the Eastros / Westros / Northros / Southros or whatever might be worth retconning, I'm sure no player cares about that


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
*the names I mean


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
my idea has always been that on Hkar, there was just one language, Human. like there is just elvish, just dwarvish, etc


[7/12/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but each migration started a new language family


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
in the doc I'm writing I eliminated Southros entirely (as "not canon yet") and "retconned" Eastros/Westros/Northros as Drankorian words for different languages they observed


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
but they would be speaking westros themselves


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
eastros and northros make sense


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
right, westros is a bit weird


[7/12/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
because it would have just been Drankorian


[7/12/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I guess this is a decision that would be worth considering. I've always assumed that "trade tongues" exist which are like simplified versions of actual languages and are represented mechanically by Common (with Eastros and Northros being "other language family" equivalents)


[7/12/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
but this would be distinct from actual langauges


[7/12/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
here's what I wrote:

## Trade Languages
Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. Many non-human creatures also know trade languages, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. Trade tongues are best thought of as pidgins, and they rarely allow for the full nuance of a native tongue. There are two trade tongues in common usage:

- **Westros**: Sometimes also called simply **Common**, this is a pidgin heavily derived from Drankorian, but with numerous loan words from Chardonian, Sembaran, and other languages of the Westros language family. It is particularly wildly known in Dunmar and amongst travelers and traders across all the regions that were once part of the Drankorian Empire. This tongue is commonly spoken by travelling non-humans as well.
- **Eastros**: A trade token derived from the languages of the Eastros language family, it is widely spoken in the eastern Green Sea, and can be heard as far west as Tollen and Cymea, and even occasionally in the port cities of Sembara. It is very rare outside the Green Sea region.

Lingua franca
A lingua franca (; lit. 'Frankish tongue'; for plurals see § Usage notes), also known as a bridge language, common language, trade language, auxiliary language, vehicular language, or link language, is a language systematically used to make communication possible between groups of people who do not share a native language or dialect, particularl...


[7/12/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that is good


[7/12/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
might want to fiddle with names


[7/12/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
I think I'm renaming the "Westros Language Family" to "Drankorian Language Family"


[7/12/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
based on the idea of defining Northos and Eastros as Drankorian words for cataloguing languages


[7/12/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
but also agree that changing the trade tongue names would be sensible


[7/12/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
historically these things didn't have very clear names (i.e. lingua franca), it would be reason to just call it something like

Green Sea Trade Tongue


[7/12/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Western Trade Tongue


[7/12/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean if we want to be complicated we should have the drankorian version, which is e.g. taught in the university of chardon still and is like the "academic but slightly culturally imperialist" version, and then what the people who speak those languages call them, translated to english


[7/12/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
you mean for the language families?


[7/12/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right, assuming the name for the trade pidgin dervies from the language family as well


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I mean, if you had a name for the ~Unamed Mariner Language~ some derivation of that would make sense for the name of the green sea trade tongue


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so to a Drankorian scholar, you have the Eastros language family, the Northros language family, and then High Drankorian and Low Drankorian


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
where Low Drankorian = the trade pidgin


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
which actually is probably the original trade pidgin of Hkar


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
right although I aslo think that _at the time of the Empire_ the pidgin probably didn't exist.


[7/12/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
would Hkar even had had a trade pidgin? I thought it would just be "human"


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
maybe there was an ancient "human pidgin" spoken between species


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
that say, halflings spread as much as humans did


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
because hey, halflings need a language to talk to their customers in


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
actually...


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
what do halflings speak to other people in


[7/12/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
well also once people start leaving hkar and languages diversify, there is still for a while a lot of back contact with hkar


[7/12/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
i actually have often wondered if the trade pidgins are acutally halfling languages


[7/12/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
wellby picked up Eastros awfully fast


[7/12/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
I envisioned Eastros as very similar to lingua franca historically, which was the trade tongue of the mediterrian


[7/12/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
whereas "westors"/"common" seems less clear


[7/12/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. in the middle ages there wasn't a trade tongue because people spoke latin


[7/12/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
but it would be interesting maybe to define "Common" as a Hkar/original human-language trade tongue spread by halflings primarily


[7/12/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
and so kinda something you might see anywhere, and not necessarily derived from Drankorian


[7/12/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
you then might retcon a bit and say that Drankorian is sometimes also used as a diplomatic language, especially before the Great War. You can imagine all of the big councils between Chardon/Sembara/Isingue in the high school campaign being conducted in Drankorian


[7/12/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
maybe that's too big a retcon...


[7/12/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think from a game perspective I don't love that, because having an ancient language that shows up in a lot of ruins but isn't widely understood in the modern world is a very useful trope


[7/12/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
what about this:


[7/12/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
I don't entirely disagree, although I think there are a lot of potential opportunties for new ancient languages. But also perhaps Drankorian has faded significantly since the Great War, and is no longer a common diplomatic tongue.

Sembara is largely isolated, and in Dunmar and Chardon, Chardonian has surplanted Drankorian (ala French in the real world)


[7/12/2024 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
- humans are created on Hkar speaking Human, and there is enough magic in the early days that while the language changes, it doesn't diversify - Hkar is big but people are teleporting and such and so you have just, Human. there are no Firstborn to keep things fixed in place of course, but still


[7/12/2024 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
- as people start leaving, they tend not to come back, at least not quickly, but went they do it is to the communities they left from. this starts to introduce some language drift - you get both new languages forming and some splitting of "Human" into dialects


[7/12/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
- the first migrants (ancestors of northerners) don't really maintain contact with Hkar, so the northerner languages feel pretty distinctive (hence Semitic languages as real-world mapping)


[7/12/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
- (possibly there are unnamed southern migrants that also establish unique languages, or these just diverge a lot after the downfall, not relevant now)


[7/12/2024 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
- when the mariners leave, however, there is a lot of travel back and forth, however, and you start to get at least two major dialects of human, that drift apart, and perhaps leads to the creation of a Hkaran pidgin


[7/12/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
- when the Downfall happens, while the settlement of Drankor is dominated by the urban city dwellers of Hkar, they are not all who survive, and the initial empire is somewhat mixed linguistically


[7/12/2024 2:54 PM] rsulfuratus
- then, post downfall, you have three developments: (1) in the growing Drankorian Empire, you have the mariner dialect kind of dying out / merging with the Hkaran pidgin, but the persistance of two languages. Drankorian proper serves the role of Latin, basically, but more like Latin in the middle ages than Latin during the Roman Empire. Anyone educated would speak it and it is the trade tongue, but plenty of "commoners" speak only the Hkaran pidgin


[7/12/2024 2:55 PM] rsulfuratus
- (2) around the green sea you have a fair bit of language diversity, and so you get the development of a true linga franca, perhaps inspired or maintained in large part by halflings; this is what the Drankorians later call Eastros


[7/12/2024 2:56 PM] rsulfuratus
- (3) in the north, there are at this point a diversity of northernern languages, and there is perhaps yet another pidgin that the Drankorians call Northros, but this kind of dies out because the Drankorian pidgin (Common) spreads and replaces it - a language that lets you talk to Drankor is a more useful trade tongue


[7/12/2024 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
- then after the fall of Drankor, the Drankorian pidgin survives but "High Drankorian" doesn't, except largely as a written language of scholars


[7/12/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
so in the current day, you have Common, which is basically the remants of the the original Hkaran "Human" and you have "Eastros" aka the Green Sea lingua franca, as the only (developed, pending the south) trade tongues


[7/12/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
One comment: I think pidgin/trade tongues should be rare(ish). I don't see any need for example to posit a "northros"


[7/12/2024 2:58 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that's fine too. Northos could just be the name for the language family written by drankorian scholars


[7/12/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
Also generally no one speaks a pidgin as a first language (that is what makes it a pidgin)


[7/12/2024 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
So what's the first language of the "commoners" above?


[7/12/2024 2:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is like a creole actually. the first language was "mariner" but that kind of dies out


[7/12/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
Right, so per wikipedia a creole is what you get when you start having native speakers of a pidgin


[7/12/2024 3:00 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe it doesn't work perfectly, since the end result should (a) the persistence of a "Common" pidgin, and (b) the development of a bunch of Drankorian-language-family languages


[7/12/2024 3:00 PM] .deciusmus
Right, the main game-problem to solve is why is Common so common


[7/12/2024 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
so, here is maybe where halflings come back


[7/12/2024 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
or just non humans in general


[7/12/2024 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I kinda like the idea of Common being totally unrelated to Drankorian per-se but just a human-derived tongue


[7/12/2024 3:01 PM] rsulfuratus
elves are pretty common in drankor, so are dwarves and of course halflings


[7/12/2024 3:02 PM] .deciusmus
But set aside common for a moment...


[7/12/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a clear picture of:

* An original tongue on Hkar (human)
* Each large migration from Hkar tended to create a new language family but currently only 3 are defined: Northos family (from the first northern migration), Eastros family (from the mariners), and Drankorian family (from the post-Downfall migration to Drankor)


[7/12/2024 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
* A lingua franca, perhaps partially halfling maintained, develops in the eastern Green Sea, and is a common trade tongue there, and is called, by Drankorians at least, Eastros


[7/12/2024 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
Then I think there are two open questions:
* Where does Common come from? 
* Was/is there a "shared" Drankorian-derived language ala Latin or French in historical periods in Europe, and if so, is it (a) the same as Common, (b) Drankorian itself, or (c) something else


[7/12/2024 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
Options for Common are 
(a) a shared Drankorian derived tongue
(b) something derived from the original Hkaran human language
(c) something halfling derived or non-human derived that is not specifially related to any human language families


[7/12/2024 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
I personally kinda like the idea that Common is not a Drankorian-derived language at all, but I'm not sold on any particular answer.

I guess from a established-facts perspective, Common was pretty rare when we were out in the east


[7/12/2024 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think from established facts there is a kind of Common / "Eastros" line somewhere east of Cymea with Eastros becoming increasingly dominant the further east you go


[7/12/2024 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that the halflings are the most interesting through line to everything


[7/12/2024 3:10 PM] .deciusmus
But also, halflings tend to go in routes that loop around, right? I mean, the Green Sea halflings don't usually go on trade runs across the continent from Sembara to Chardon


[7/12/2024 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
well, some of them do. the Charmhearts for example


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
but, yes, this would be rarer


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
I thought the Charmhearts went back and forth from Embry <-> Chardon,


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, you don't usually have halflings going from Irrla to Chardon


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
or Medju to Chardon


[7/12/2024 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, right, yes, Sembara is kind of the inflection point as that is where you go from sea based to land based


[7/12/2024 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, my idea about halflings is less that Common is a halfling language, but that somehow interacting with halflings leads to these pidgin tongues persisting in a way that they might not otherwise


[7/12/2024 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., perhaps Common is basically the original Hkaran "Human" language, and Eastros is the original mariner language. humans live longer and change quicker and don't have a racial memory to fall back on so their languages change fast


[7/12/2024 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
So you could imagine something like:

In the years after the Downfall, Drankorian spread as a language and for the most part, it was used as the common language across the whole western part of Taelgar.

But when Drankor fell, and the disruptions of the plague and so on occurred, and as the different parts of the old Drankorian empire lost touch with each other, the common language collapsed, and mutually unintelligble languages started to develop.

But the halflings kept alive a Drankorian-derived trade tongue


[7/12/2024 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm actually thinking the same story but further back


[7/12/2024 3:14 PM] .deciusmus
Alternatively, Common could be as you say, Hkarian/original human


[7/12/2024 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
But then why didn't it persist in the eastern Green sea? Historical happenstance is a reasonable answer I guess


[7/12/2024 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. Common = Human, and it persisted in the Drankorian empire (despite the spread of an alternate lingua franca) because non-humans, especially halfilngs, kept speakin git


[7/12/2024 3:15 PM] rsulfuratus
one idea is that the mariners left hkar in part in explicit rejection of the urban elites


[7/12/2024 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
part of that explicit rejection was linguistic


[7/12/2024 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so halflings in the mariner-influenced parts of the green sea speak the mariner lingua franca not the drankorian lingua franca


[7/12/2024 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
Right, although I guess Common is more like a Hkaran lingua franca


[7/12/2024 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[7/12/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing says it couldn't be what the elves in the southern continent use to talk to the humans in the southern contiennt


[7/12/2024 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[7/12/2024 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
basically it leaves open the south entirely


[7/12/2024 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
So eastros develops as an explicit rejection of "Common", rather than a "natual language evolution"


[7/12/2024 3:18 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[7/12/2024 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so revising, I would say:
- Common = Hkaran, was the original language of humans
- Northerners left, speaking Common, but the language moved on and their language evolved as there was not much contact, and there was no northern lingua franca and honestly not a lot of halflings up there either, so you get a new language family just from drift and natural change
- (southerners TBD)
- mariners leave as part of an explict rejection of urban Hkar and linguistically evolve with intentionality, creating the mariner language family (which the Drankorians call Eastros)
- halflings and contact with other nonhumans maintains the original Hkaran lingua franca as Common, but humans in the Drankorian Empire speak Drankorian as their first tongue, which then diversifies; a similar process happens in the east but with "mariner" instead of "common"


[7/12/2024 3:22 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I think then that means the default is that any human population could plausibly have maintained Common as a lingua franca / trade pidgin, if desired


[7/12/2024 3:23 PM] .deciusmus
here's what I have in Obsidian

## Trade Languages
Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. Many non-human creatures also know trade languages, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. Trade tongues are best thought of as pidgins, and they rarely allow for the full nuance of a native tongue. There are two trade tongues in common usage:

- **Common**: An ancient trade tongue derived from the original language of humans, it is commonly used by non-humans, especially halflings to conduct business and trade, and is widely spoken by traders and travelers across the lands that were once part of the Drankorian Empire.
- **Eastros**: A trade tongue derived from the languages of the Eastros language family, it is widely spoken in the eastern Green Sea, and can be heard as far west as Tollen and Cymea, and even occasionally in the port cities of Sembara. It is very rare outside the Green Sea region.

%% 
Background Note: ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ developed as a separate tongue from Common primarily because of the mariner's explicit cultural rejection of the Hkaran elite, who spoke the language Common is derived from. Eastros is in turn a remanent/pidgin derived from the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~. Halfling telepathy and long-lived non-humans are the primary mechanisms that prevents linguistic drift of these trade tongues. 
%%


[7/12/2024 3:23 PM] rsulfuratus
human populations where common is rare, or where a different trade pidgin is spoken, should have an explanation


[7/12/2024 3:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I would also add a background note that Common may well be spoken in far flung parts of the world - as it doesnt have any explicit connection to Drankorian it doesn't have to be limited


[7/12/2024 3:25 PM] .deciusmus
added:

Common could reasonably be spoken as a trade pidgin anywhere, and human populations where common is rare, or where a different trade pidgin is spoken, should have an explanation.

## Human Language Families
The human tongues of the known world are broadly divided up into three major language families based on ancient migrations and cultural divisions on the original human homeland of [[Hkar]]:

* **Northros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken across the northern reaches of Taelgar, named Northros by Drankorian cataloguers of languages. These languages are spoken by the cultures that departed Hkar in the ancient days.
* **Eastros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken primarily across the eastern parts of the [[Green Sea]], as far west as [[Skaerhem|Skaer]]. This language is derived from an ancient mariner culture that originally settled much of the [[Green Sea]] region, and these languages were given the name Eastros by Drankorian scholars.
* **Drankorian Language Family**: A set of languages spoken by [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and those cultures that inherited the Drankorian cultural traditions. It is derived from the language spoken on [[Hkar]] and the time of the [[The Downfall|Downfall]].

There are some other human languages, notably Dunmari, that do not fit into any of the language familes above, and there are rumors and fragments from Drankor of other languages spoken in the far east or far south, which may not fit into these categories as well.


[7/12/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I think actually it is worth being explict about Dunmari. The Drankorian scholars might not have written much about it but it is basically the sister tongue to Drankorian language family (hence using the Indo- side of the Indo-European languages to represent it)


[7/12/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
basically the Dunmari (and possibly some others) were the last group of pre-Downfall migrants from Hkar


[7/12/2024 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
I was going to be explict about Dunmari in the section where I write the actual languages

[7/12/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
%% Background Note:
This section is intended to be both canonical and sufficiently vague as to not block new invention. Broadly, the assumption is that each of the [[Human Cultures of Taelgar|migrations from Hkar]] map to a specific language family:
* Early Explorers = Northros
* Pre-Urban Exodus = undefined southern tongue
* Mariner Migration = Eastros
* Downfall Refugees = Drankorian

Where the minor migrations, such as the Dunmari, would have potentially unique histories, and may or may not fit into one of the language families above, 

When determining real-world language analogues:
* Northos in general uses Semitic languages
* Eastros and any subsequent migration use Indo-European languages, with Eastros tending towards Slavic/Germanic, and Drankorian tending towards Italic/Hellenic. Other migrations (i.e. Dunmari) that are after the mariner migration should probably be their own branches of the Indo-European language family.
* The Pre-Urban exodus is explicitly undefined, and could be Indo-European or something else

Non-Human tongues should generally avoid Indo-European + Semitic, to maintain distinctness but this is not a hard-and-fast rule.

[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
What language did the Vargaldi speak?


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
should they have their own language?


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
you only talked to them in Eastros


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
(or with magic)


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
right


[7/12/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
so probably they have their own Northros derived language


[7/12/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I would assume. Jotha was able to pick it up fairly quickly, for example


[7/12/2024 3:42 PM] rsulfuratus
however I tended to use slavic names for them, not that I think it really matters that much. their writing system is almost certainly mariner-derived, for example, and probably have a bunch of loan words from eastros


[7/12/2024 3:43 PM] .deciusmus
we need a name for ~Unnamed Marnier Language~


[7/12/2024 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
on a related topic, for calibration, in the real world it looks like the best estimates have proto-indo-european spoken between 4500 - 2500 BCE, so like 5000-6000 years ago


[7/12/2024 3:50 PM] rsulfuratus
with a lot of the proto-Italic, proto-Germanic etc early divergenes spoken ~1000-500 BCE, so 3000-3500 years ago


[7/12/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually can't find my notes in Obisidan about when humans were created


[7/12/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
ah found it. 1750 per Timeline Notes in brainstorming. so that is like 4500 years that humans have existed, but significantly less time that human languages have been diverging


[7/12/2024 3:58 PM] .deciusmus
well, Drankorian languages have been divering for like 700 years, right?


[7/12/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[7/12/2024 3:59 PM] .deciusmus
reading about the history of romance languages, it actually would make sense that prior to the Great War lots of Drankorian languages were mutually intelligible.


[7/12/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
pre Great War there is likely some divergence between the western and eastern sides of the mountains, especially since Dunmar is a clean linguistic break in between


[7/12/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I was about to say the same


[7/12/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
they are also drawing loan words from very different source: northros in the west, eastros in the east


[7/12/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
So probably you do end up with 4 languages:

Chardonian
Sembaran
Isinguese
Cymean

But Isinguese and Cymean are likely even now close to mutually understandable (i.e. Portugese and Spanish) although Isginuese is dying out

(although I'm not sure what language the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez speaks...)


[7/12/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that works.


[7/12/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
well, you might also have Illorian in the west, with a similar relationship with Chardonian as Isinguese / Cymean


[7/12/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Is Illorian drankorian?


[7/12/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, although with a lot of loan words. Drankor built the canal after all and founded Darba


[7/12/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
you had a note in "Human Cultures of Taelgar"

%% Illoria seems like a place that could have a cultural descendancy from the "southern" exodus, although probably not a cultural connection. Perhaps Illorian is a unique language that is more related to Southern than anything else? %%


[7/12/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
ha forgot about that


[7/12/2024 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
but I'm not really sure that makes sense


[7/12/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I kinda think it makes more sense as Drankorian


[7/12/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
or, rather, Illoria was certainly occupied and settled by Drankorians. perhaps there is a unique reason why they have a remnant language, but I don't have a good idea at the moment


[7/12/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., there is certainly space for a tywingha-like aspect of Illorian that coexists with a more drankorian version, but no reason to create that now


[7/12/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
on the western branch of the Drankorian languages there are also likely a number of somewhat mutually intelligble Chardonian-like languages that were spoken by a variety of post-Drankorian northern kingdoms, of which Chardonian is the only one that survived the great war


[7/12/2024 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
and, I do kind of wonder if Isinguese it its own language whether Tollish should be as well, but one that has a very close relationship with Sembaran. probably not worth inventing that much detail though


[7/12/2024 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
I dunno, I'm kinda into making up language details


[7/12/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
I think it would actually make sense for there to be a Tollenish as well, which is where sembaran gets it English


[7/12/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
Tollenish is an blended Eastros/Drankorian tongue with Germanic roots that was historically related to Skaer and spoken all along the Sembaran coast


[7/12/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
right, actually having Tollish (I think Tollish instead of Tollenish) and Sembaran converge to mutual intelligibilty from distinct roots is kind of nice


[7/12/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
If anyone got *really* into the details, there is probably a southern Sembaran and northern Sembaran, where southern Sembaran is more French and northern Sembaran is more English


[7/12/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
and northern Sembaran is closely related to Tollish


[7/12/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
from a game perspective its all a dialect specturm where Sembaran/Tollish are all the same.

But it gives an opportunity for an "Old Tollish" as an ancient no-longer-spoken language that is not the same as Sembaran or modern Tollish


[7/12/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
and could be where the Tyrwinghan & Vosic alphabets come from


[7/12/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
maybe that's too much detail but it kinda makes sense


[7/12/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
actually in the very first campaign with Isaac and Nathaniel I had a scholar who knew Skaer but could read old Tyrwinghan inscriptions, so it is dubiously canonical even

[7/12/2024 9:03 PM] rsulfuratus
added some mostly minor comments but I think at this point easier to edit via discord + obsidian that git pull requests. 

the two major gaps for me are
(a) the languages of other planes really need more substantial thought
(b) there is definitely a cultural thread that feels like it is missing from the history of the west that I need to sort out a bit at some point, but the language doc is not the place for that


[7/12/2024 9:03 PM] rsulfuratus
so i am going to merge


[7/12/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
sounds good


[7/13/2024 11:46 AM] .deciusmus
I’m working on one more update to languages. Basic idea:
- push the exotic races and extra planar to own pages so I don’t have to publish them for my players and we can leave them less canon
- rewrote Chardon to leave the northern west coast ambiguous


[7/13/2024 11:48 AM] .deciusmus
I’m also simplifying Northros to leave the Vargardli in a comment and position Mawaran / Old Zimkovan / Deno’qai more as examples of a wide undefined set


[7/13/2024 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm in the process of updating the West Coast history in the worldbuilding/background with a bit more thinking

{Reactions}
👍

[7/13/2024 11:49 AM] .deciusmus
The biggest question for me that’s outstanding before finalizing some version of the languages doc is Vosic/Vostok language


[7/13/2024 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
in my west coast thinking I am feeling like there is, potentially a missing cultural group. the issue is that a lot of the stuff that's happened north of charrdon is kind of dubiously canonical - all from high school campaign and my game with Isaac


[7/13/2024 11:50 AM] rsulfuratus
but I think this impinges on the Vos a bit as well, who are fairly unsatisfyingly developed IMO


[7/13/2024 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
We structured the Hkar migrations to make it quite easy to add a “second dunmari” group


[7/13/2024 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
the missing cultural group is the post-Drankor, pre-Great War northern kingdoms that were never conquered by Drankor


[7/13/2024 11:51 AM] .deciusmus
Ie a migration that left say just before the downfall


[7/13/2024 11:51 AM] rsulfuratus
the vibe from high school was kind of medieval german, these were like Volkrad and related


[7/13/2024 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
the main distinction is I don't think it is quite right to have only the northerner / Deno'qai and the Drankorian strands in the north


[7/13/2024 11:52 AM] rsulfuratus
the two options that I've thought of are (a) another Dunmari-style migration, pre-Downfall, and (b) a western migration of the easterners/mariners that stretches across the mountains


[7/13/2024 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
Right. It would make perfect sense that there was a late migration from Hkar, worshipping a form of Mos Numena, and speaking Germanic


[7/13/2024 11:53 AM] .deciusmus
I don’t like the mariners making it so far west


[7/13/2024 11:56 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, okay, I wasn't sure about the mariners


[7/13/2024 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
so then the question is about mirgrations east. the Zimka and the Vargald are definitely northerners and related to the deno'qai


[7/13/2024 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
the Skaer are definitely mariner


[7/13/2024 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
but I'm actually not entirely sure about the Vos


[7/13/2024 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
My headcannon which does not need to be actual canon is something like...

(a) a broad group of Northerns, worshipping the kestavo gods and speaking a northros language ("old Zimkovan" currently) come over the mountains and spread in a broad swath between the Sentinels and the Svinjo mountains, but staying in the land of rivers and hills, not heading down toward the coast
(b) the Skaer come from the east, with a totally different culture, and settle along the coasts


[7/13/2024 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, that I agree with


[7/13/2024 11:59 AM] rsulfuratus
but I am a bit unsatisfied with the Vos as just a Skaer/Northern mix


[7/13/2024 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I agree. I think currently, there are probably at least 5 cultural traditions:

(a) the "traditional/old" Zimka who still speak the original Zimkovan language and still, today, worship kestavo
(b) the "new/highlander" Zimka (Ardlas/Lavnoch/Breva) who have intermarried and intermixed with Sembara much more heavily, and speak their own (probably Eastros) languages and worship Mos Numena. Perhaps culturally similar to Tollen
(c)  the Skaer, who speak their own Eastros derived language, and worship their own god
(d) the Tyrwinghans, who speak their own language somtimes (unclear derivation) but are quite Sembaran in some ways and worship Mos Numena
(e) the Vos, who are somewhat poorly defined


[7/13/2024 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
actually, plus
(f) the Tollenders, who speak their own language, closely related to Sembaran, and who worship Mos Numena


[7/13/2024 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
then of course the Sembarans, Isinguese, etc


[7/13/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
The Tollender history is quite well defined, as effectively emerging from a schism within the broader Skaer culture between those who became heavily Drankorian influenced vs those who didn't


[7/13/2024 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure that is quite right. I've never thought of the people of Tollen as having a particularly close cultural or linguistic connection to the Skaer


[7/13/2024 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
that feels like a fairly significant retcon?


[7/13/2024 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I maybe misread your Tollen history


[7/13/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
But I thought it was a Skaer city post Downfall?


[7/13/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
from the Tollen page:

By the 4200s, the Skaer have established themselves as the dominant mariner culture in the [[Western Green Sea]], and resettle and rebuild Tollen. Over the next 300 years, the Skaer grow stronger, spreading along the coast as far south as the mouth of the [[Semb]], raiding upriver for timber and impressed sailors to row their great ships, and seeking converts for their religion. Tollen develops as a major trade center for the emerging Skaer empire, and begins to grow again.


[7/13/2024 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so the idea was something more analagous to london. founded by Skaer, but then they left


[7/13/2024 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
basically when drankor shows up the skaer give up tollen


[7/13/2024 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
Ok, I see. This sentence is doing a lot of work:

However, the Skaer are forbidden from bringing ships up the [[Volta]], and Tollen falls outside their sway and comes under the influence of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]].


[7/13/2024 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah the tollen page needs some cleanup


[7/13/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
I wasn't trying to retcon, just going from the Tollen page


[7/13/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe Tollish should be a more Drankorian-derived language than I had it, i.e. not Eastros


[7/13/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
Anyway, ignoring that all for a minute, I still think the basic division of 7 cultural tradtions ("old Zimka", "new Zimka", Skaer, Tyrwinghan, Tollen, Vos, and Sembaran) is a good starting spot


[7/13/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[7/13/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
Here's what I have at the beginning of Sembaran history:

In the aftermath of [[The Downfall]] the land that will become [[Sembara]] is lightly populated. The [[Kestavo|kestavo-worshipping]] [[Zimkova|Zimka]] live in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]], and have spread amongst the highlands, and down the valleys of the great rivers: the [[Semb]], the [[Volta]], the [[Teft]], and the [[Wistel]]. Along the coast, [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] mariners raid, intermarry, and settle amongst the Zimka, and a Skaer-dominated mixed culture spreads from [[Tollen]] to the mouth of the [[Semb]]. The once mighty [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] swamps have mostly disappeared, save for remnants: [[Ozabal]], at the mouth of the [[Wistel]] and [[Latazaro]], in the east, where a thriving lizardfolk communities remain. South of the Wistel is the mixed community of humans, clustered along the coast, united by the their shared allegiance to the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], but otherwise the southern lands are largely empty of humans.


[7/13/2024 12:15 PM] .deciusmus
Which I think still stands


[7/13/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that seems right


[7/13/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
The "Skaer dominated" mixed culture, becomes the substrate for 3 cultures, I think: Sembaran, "new Zimka" ,and Tollen


[7/13/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
But all three are heavily influenced by Drankor


[7/13/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
But I actually think the Vos are both more complex that just "the Vos" and something else...


[7/13/2024 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
So you basically have...

"Old Tollish" culture, which is the Skaer dominated coastal culture, speaking an Eastros language. 
Zimka, up in the mountains
Trywinghans, in Tyrwinghan

Then when Drankor comes along, the Skaer part of the Skaer dominated flees. And Drankor splits the Old Tollish culture into 3:

* Sembara, settled by Drankor
* "New Zimka", in the highlands, separated and evolving separately from the original Old Tollish, but culturally resistent to Drankorian influence
* Tollen, along the Volta and parts of the coast, culturally open to Drankor, but independent


[7/13/2024 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
that suggests that Tollish is probably a Drankorian language, very similar to Sembaran. Whereas Old Tollish is a potentially lost Eastros language, but is the lingusitic ancestor of "new Zimka"


[7/13/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
here is a possible tweak


[7/13/2024 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I think the idea pre-Drankor is that you have the martime Skaer empire, which is very maritime, and goes upriver a bit but basically does not settle inland


[7/13/2024 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so there is already a growing split among the Skaer, between the settlers and the sailors


[7/13/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
the old mariner religion was probably a pantheonic one, with more than a single god. the idea behind the Skaer is that only Kaikkea survived


[7/13/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but pre-Drankor there could already be some religious splits happening


[7/13/2024 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
we've already vaguely established the mariner religion as for some reason more prone to schisms and evolution than Mos Numena, which is largely unchanged (in divinity, if not in human practice) since Hkar itself


[7/13/2024 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so leaning into that, you have the mariner pantheon fragmenting a bit


[7/13/2024 12:28 PM] rsulfuratus
that gives you three distinct religious traditions in post-Downfall, pre-Drankor Sembara:
- the Skaer, worshipping Kaikkea, who are powerful maritime empire but don't settle away from the coast, speaking an Eastros language
- the Zimka, in the highlands, speaking a Nortros language, worshipping the Kestavo, and drifting down river valleys
- the Tollish, worshipping the non-Kaikkea parts of the old mariner pantheon, speaking an Eastros language, but diverging culturally from the Skaer pretty quickly


[7/13/2024 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
(this is basically what you wrote but adding the religious twist)


[7/13/2024 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, when Drankor comes, the Tollish gods just die out.


[7/13/2024 12:29 PM] rsulfuratus
and the Skaer retreat


[7/13/2024 12:30 PM] rsulfuratus
the Drankorian "conquest" of Sembara doesn't really involve wars, so perhaps the Tollish assimalte pretty quickly. maybe there is a magical thing, the Drankorians ride in to save them from a dragon or whatever


[7/13/2024 12:31 PM] rsulfuratus
theorectically, this could leave Tyrwingha as the remnant of the old Tollish culture


[7/13/2024 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
Right... although the interventionist trend in Sembaran worship was meant to come from the kestavo tradition. So I'm not 100% about the religious twist. But largely seems sensible


[7/13/2024 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, right, so maybe it is better if the Tollish are kestavan


[7/13/2024 12:32 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe for some reason the mariner gods are dying already. something about the downfall kills them, only kaikkea survives


[7/13/2024 12:33 PM] rsulfuratus
or the downfall sickens them and over the next 100 years all the mariner gods but Kaikkea stop responding to prayers


[7/13/2024 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
Sure, that could work. I kinda want to leave who exactly the Tyrwinghans are slightly undefined because it could become relevant to my game. But I think the general idea of the Skaer/Zimka/"Tollish" split works well


[7/13/2024 12:34 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, they don't need to be the ancestors of the Tyrwinghans


[7/13/2024 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
Exactly whether the Tyrwinghans are Tollish or not probably doesnt matter, although I like the idea that Tyrwinghan language is written with the Eastros alphabet


[7/13/2024 12:35 PM] .deciusmus
I also like the "new Zimka" (i.e. Sembaran highland kingdoms) to be remenant of the old Tollish culture, speaking an Eastros ather than Northos language (as I've used Slavic pretty heavily in naming)


[7/13/2024 12:36 PM] rsulfuratus
from a linguistic point of view, I kind of think that perhaps Sembaran and Tollish should be kind of analagous to what might have happened to english if the norman conquest involved a dramatically bigger population shift


[7/13/2024 12:36 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that was my idea


[7/13/2024 12:37 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is a bit hard to classify. uses the drankorian alphabet, but is it really an eastros language or a drankorian language? it is kind of a fusion


[7/13/2024 12:37 PM] .deciusmus
Sembaran probably originated as a creole language between Old Tollish and Drankorian


[7/13/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
maybe there shouldn't be  aseparate Tollish language at all... and Sembaran should be pretty distinct from Isinguese/Cymean


[7/13/2024 12:38 PM] rsulfuratus
so that is the direction i was going


[7/13/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
I've actually played Sembaran in my naming as a very random mix of English and French


[7/13/2024 12:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I think a Tollish dialect makes sense, but kind of like catalan vs spanish. tollish has a bit more eastros loan words, sembaran a bit more drankorian, but they are mutually intelligeble and closely related

👍

[7/13/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
So you could imagine something like:

Old Tollish, the language of the original Tollish culture that existed immediately post Downfall. No longer spoken, but does survive as a scholarly language in Tollen. Eastros/Eastros alphabet.

New Zimkovan, derived form Old Tollish, but adopted the Drankorian alphabet. New name for what we used to call Highlander. Eastros language. 

Sembaran. A creole that developed as a mix between Drankorian and Old Tollish. Fairly distinct from the rest of the Drankorian languages. English/French. Drankorian alphabet.

Tollish. Closely related to Sembaran and but with slightly more Eastros loan words and flavor.


[7/13/2024 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
And then Tyrwinghan is somewhat undefined, but was clearly influenced in alphabet at least by Old Tollish.


[7/13/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
right, plus Insinguese and Cymean which are much more proper Drankorian languages, and while possibly mutually intelligeble are probably not so with Sembaran


[7/13/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
Skaer & Old Zimkovan are their own things (Eastros/Northros).
And Isinguese and Cymean as you say - mutually understandable but not with Sembarans.


[7/13/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
Culturally it leaves Vostok somewhat ill defined.


[7/13/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
(although, for a game that doesn't want to consider languages too much, you could mechanically decide that all the "Eastern Drankorian" languages fall into a single mechanical language)


[7/13/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. vostok does not feel like it is either Old Tollish or Skaer or Zimkovan


[7/13/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I think Vostok is something else. Originally northern


[7/13/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
But not really part of the Old Tollish cultural spread.


[7/13/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
or, potentially, a migration of the western non-northern, non-Drankor culture


[7/13/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
Right, although it is weirdly placed for that. Although lots of reasons that a new culture could have ended up there


[7/13/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
`I think that I would leave Vosic for now as a bit of an orphan language, not clearly part of any language family, similar to Tyrwinghan


[7/13/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. I actually think there could be pretty clearly 2 Vosic languages


[7/13/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
Aren't lots of the coast of eastern Vostok heavily Skaer influenced?


[7/13/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
Should there be a "Coastal Vosic" that is clearly similar to Skaer? Or is that overselling the connection?


[7/13/2024 12:51 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, there are really potentially as many as four vos cultural threads, perhaps even more:
- a coastal vos culture that has a long association with the skaer, although not sharing a religion. 
- the "lakes and rivers" vos culture that is very undefined but largely not skaer influenced and probably not northern either
- the kind of tollen hills culture, imediately east of tollen and near the straights of cymea, that is a lowland / coastal culture but one that is more distinct from the skaer
- potentially a northerner / zimka culture in the upper volta valley


[7/13/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
The current Vostok doc says:

Most of the population lives in the southern part of Vostok, called Voslaag ("home of the lowlanders"; often called South Vostok or South Vosland in [[Sembara]]), within a hundred miles of the coast, and along the lower [[Kem]] river valley. This is a region of few cities, few roads, and difficult travel, with lots of uninhabited land even within the most organized territories of major clans and chiefs. Boats, both on the rivers and the coastal [[Green Sea]], are crucial to trade, travel, and communication throughout Voslaag. 

[[Cymea]] and [[Tollen]], with their strong naval traditions, have often looked to Voslaag for tribute and resources, whether extracted by violence or as part of recognition of an outside overlord. But these relationships - beyond some annual tribute (oftentimes labor, such as sailors for the navy) and a perhaps a personal relationship between a Vos and Cymean or [[Tollen]] leader - have left little impact on the internal culture and politics of Vostok. 

Few people live in the forests and hills of the northern plateaus, the region called Voskald ("homeland of the people of the cold"; often referred to as North Vostok or North Vosland in Sembara). Much more than the people of Voslaag, the Voskalders are closely connected by culture and shared history with the [[Zimkova]], especially the traditionalists in the north.


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah so this is the basic inland / coastal distinction


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
I think that is good to keep as canon


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
But that doesn't mean the northern vostok are just one group


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] rsulfuratus
but there might be multiple distinct cultural groups within each category


[7/13/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
right


[7/13/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
for the coastal people, the Voslaag, I think there are reasonably a Skaer-influenced and a Skaer-independent group, but that might not involve different languages


[7/13/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
for now I don't think this needs to be developed too much beyond what is in the Vostok doc


[7/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
Right so from a linguistic standpoint, there are three ways to write this:

(a) just leave Vosic out of the languages doc entirely, i.e. put some notes in %% but don't publish it for my players. They won't care
(b) canonically define at least 2 Vos languages (Southern Vosic and Northern Vosic perhaps with better names) Souther = Eastros, Northern = Nrothros
(c) defined Vosic as "a collection of languages spoken in the Vostok region with a range of influences"


[7/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
with a note that we might decide to split it


[7/13/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd probably just leave one Vosic language, with the note that this might not be all there is, and without much detail


[7/13/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so basically option (c)


[7/13/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
right ok.


[7/13/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
so we are about to go get lunch but what I'm going to try to write up this afternoon or evening is

(a) an upate to the language doc that covers this stuff.  
Summary:
1. Add Old Tollish/Tollish/Old Zimka/New Zimka/Tyrwinghan as discssed here
2. Make Sembaran a creole/not same as Drankorian as discussed here
3. Vague-ify Vosic and move it to the Miscellaneous languages section
4. Move most exotic and extra planer to separate page to allow for vagueness

(b) an update my  Synthesis of Humanity in Greater Sembara doc in background
1. Introduces and clarifies the key idea here of Zimka/Tollish/Skaer and the evolution
2. Mentions the problem of Vostok and some of the non-canonical ideas here


[7/13/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I'll push both and tag status/tim. My goal is to publish the language doc for Kiya at least (she wants details on what languages and alphabets Celyn knows) by the end of the weekend or early next week

{Reactions}
👍

[7/13/2024 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
Final language page per the above is pushed


[7/14/2024 7:56 PM] .deciusmus
Do you have any specific thoughts about writing systems? Kiya and I were talking a bit about what Sylvan writing is actually like


[7/14/2024 8:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a feeling, although not certain, that the first writing was done by the titans, dragons, archfey, and primordial elementals. The elder folk adopted it. So my guess would be sylvan -> elven, giant -> stoneborn, dwarven. Halflings probably developed writing late as their “native magic” is not written, and probably adopted an alphabet from somewhere.


[7/14/2024 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
So it might be that elvish and sylvan share an alphabet. But open to other ideas


[7/14/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
That was my exact thought as well


[7/14/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
Not the share an alphabet necessarily but that writing originated with the fey and titans


[7/14/2024 8:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah


[7/14/2024 8:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Well, dragons also but they probably didn’t pass on writing in the same way. Draconic writing is probably inherently magical


[7/14/2024 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
I also kinda think that humans on Hkar created (or were given) their own writing system, not derived from the titan or fey line


[7/14/2024 8:34 PM] .deciusmus
So from that (and a bit of reading about human writing systems and some ideas from Kiya) I was thinking something like...

The original titans developed a runic system that embodied their crafting and creation. The key thing about runic systems is that (at least, some people theorize) letters also stand in for words. Which seems very appropriate for titans -> dwarves -> stoneborn


[7/14/2024 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
The fey similarly developed a writing system, but I have this sense it is very complex. Perhaps logographic with many characters, and perhaps complex in some other way (the characters have different meanings depending on some notion of time/place?).

The elves then were taught this fey system by Elmerca, but simplified it substantially for their own use, effectively evolving it into a proper alphabet


[7/14/2024 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
The humans on Hkar then developed their own system, which evolved into a couple of different lineages, in the same way the Phonecian alphabet became Greek + Latin + Cyrllic.

These lineages become the Northros/Drankorian/Eastros alphabets which are the main "known" human alphabets (although perhaps the original northern alphabet is lost or was changed in some way or replacd by Drankorian in many cases)


[7/15/2024 9:35 AM] rsulfuratus
About to go to a meeting but a morning thought: before settling too strongly on writing systems and alphabets, it might be worth thinking a bit about the role of magic. what language are scrolls and spellbooks "written" in, for example? 

In general though, I think that humans creating/receiving a "standard" alphabetic writing system along with the "Human" language (which becomes Common) on Hkar makes total sense, which then evolves into the modern day alphabets. I think roughly the time depth is right to have everything as closely related as Greek-derived alphabets (e.g., Latin, Cyrillic, maybe some runic alphabets like Furthak). But no Arabic/Hebrew style alphabets where vowels are not letters, for example, which are an older divergence.

Might think a bit more later today when meetings are over a little more about "original Fey", "original Titan", and "original Draconic" which woudl be the three main "magic alphabets" in a sense. Elementals feel different, and the "outer planes" languages (celestial, infernal, etc) I think should be radically different.


[7/15/2024 9:37 AM] .deciusmus
I was also thinking a bit about the "why". Why do fey or titans or dragons develop a written language at all?


[7/15/2024 9:37 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not totally convinced, for example, that dragons bother to develop a specific mechanism designed to encode their draconic thoughts on paper. Is draconic writing really a language at all?


[7/15/2024 9:38 AM] .deciusmus
Or is it say, a way of encoding magic? Did/do dragons create monuments with their names on them, in their own language?


[7/15/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
These questions don't specifically need answers for dragons, as my only real goal is to figure out what fey writing is like


[7/15/2024 9:40 AM] .deciusmus
But the same questions apply to titans and fey. Do titans write letters to each other? It feels to me like in the age of myth, probably not. Is anyone thinking about recording "events" for the "future" when time itself is not stable?


[7/15/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
my assumption is this has to do with magic. the original titan language is rune magic, for example. i guess draconic is probably in some sense the language of arcane magic


[7/15/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the fey, though, are probably doing things like writing stories. writing in the mythic age doesn't develop for normal human reasons, since the fey don't care about tracking grain harvests and writing memorials on tombs or decrees and edicts


[7/15/2024 10:44 AM] rsulfuratus
but, they are probably writing novels


[7/15/2024 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
Right that all makes sense to me


[7/15/2024 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
But it suggests that the draconic language might not have any direct relationship to human alphabets or even to a further mechanism dragons might develop to say write orders to kobolds in draconic


[7/15/2024 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea that fey writing originally developed to write stories, plays, poems, etc


[7/15/2024 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus
i was actually contemplating making draconic in some form, or at least the draconic alphabet, the language of spellbooks. or maybe arcane spells in general. need to think a bit more


[7/15/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
no one has played a wizard for any length of time in Taelgar


[7/15/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
Eric has fiddled a bit with Seeker being interested in giants because of the connection to dwarven runic magic, though


[7/15/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
Right, sure, I find that idea interesting and plausible but just not really related to why fey develop writing


[7/15/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/15/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
I think there probably doesn't need to be a "Grand Unified Theory" of why the children of the divine developed writing


[7/15/2024 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
for the fey specifically, I would definitely say that in the age of myth, the archfey invented writing specifically as an art form.


[7/15/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
And so making something up about fey -> elvish doesn't necessarily have to have any impact on giants -> dwarves or dragons -> spellbooks


[7/15/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
this probably makes the sylvan script quite complicated. maybe like japanese in a sense, where you have simultaenously logographcs and a syllabary


[7/15/2024 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
Right, or Eygptian hieroglyphics.


[7/15/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
But also, I was trying to brainstorm ways the fey might have used it as an art form to make it feel a bit non-human...

For example, what is there was an element of fey writing that meant something different depending on the time of day (i.e. place in the feywild) you read it? So to properly interpret fey writing you need to know *where* it was supposed to be read


[7/15/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Or, some type of tonal indicator, a note or glyph representing a note, which provided an emotional overlay on the writing, which might change the meaning of words


[7/15/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
Or even some type of magical element, where it is hard to write properly without the correct magical sense, because there are some logograms that mean different things depending on the magic used to write them


[7/15/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
Kiya who has a hobbiest interest in ancient Egypt, was telling me about an aspect of hieroglpyhics that seemed interesting...

> The fun thing about hieroglyphics, by the way, is the determinatives, which are basically non-pronounced ideographic characters at the end of words to tell you what kind of word they are.  So, like, a motion-verb might end in [walking feet] so you know how to read it, or a name might end [figure of man], [figure of god], or [figure of dog] so you knew if someone was talking about a guy named Anup (Anubis), the god Anubis, or a dog named Anubis.
> If a determinative is specific enough sometimes it's just straight-up used as an ideogram.


[7/15/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think the "pure" form of sylvan writing would be very hard for humans to read, or really for non-fey to read. i think the emotional/tonal overlay is the right direction, where the meaning of a glyph changes depending on how the person who wrote it was feeling, and to properly understand it you have to read it in the feywild, where the emotional resonance of the glyph can be allowed to change your emotions as you read


[7/15/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
building on Kiya's point, proper "full sylvan" probably has magically encoded emotional determinatives


[7/15/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I like that


[7/15/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
but, that means you can't fully understand proper "high sylvan" or whatever outside the feywild, most likely


[7/15/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
there would also be something like "low sylvan" where the emotional determatives are written out


[7/15/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
(For in-game interest, I'd probably assume Detect Magic lets you sense them)


[7/15/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, that's a good idea


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
I was thinking why have low sylvan? When fey writing first developed, there was no "feywild" vs "material" plane and everyone could just understand the emotional determiniatives


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
well, sometimes the fey presumably need to write something that will pass out of the feywild


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Then, after the Riving, when the fey first thought it was useful to communicate with others, they just adopted elvish


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] rsulfuratus
ah, sure, okay, that might make more sense


[7/15/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
which might be, after all, just a simplified form of sylvan anyway


[7/15/2024 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
More in a bit, have a meeting now


[7/15/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
I basically like the idea of somewhat modelling on ancient egyptian...

1) sylvan is a complex logo-syllabic script with 1000+ glyphs and emotional/magic determiniatives that make it hard to write, as well as a strong culture of "presentation" concerns (i.e. some fey would care how the written page physically looked, since it was developed for art anyway)
2) elvish evovled from sylvan in the same way demotic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)) evolved from hierglyphics

{Embed}
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demotic_(Egyptian)
Demotic (Egyptian)
Demotic (from Ancient Greek: δημοτικός dēmotikós, 'popular') is the ancient Egyptian script derived from northern forms of hieratic used in the Nile Delta. The term was first used by the Greek historian Herodotus to distinguish it from hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts. By convention, the word "Demotic" is capitalized in order to distinguish it ...

[7/15/2024 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that description of sylvan is basically in the right direction


[7/15/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the relationship between sylvan and elven scripts might require a bit more thought. i'm not sure it makes sense for elvish to have really a feeling of "evolved", if it was given to the elves by Elmerica. 

I kind of feel like one of two paths makes sense:
1) after the riving, a simplified fey script develops that is more of a syllabary and is somewhat easier for non-fey to read and write, and preserves meaning better across planes. this is never really a focal concern of the fey, and when it is picked up and formalized by the elves it basically just becomes elvish. 
2) after the riving, when the elves are created, Elmerica gives them language and writing, basically drawing from and simplifying Sylvan into a syllabary in the process


[7/15/2024 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
the distinction is maybe subtle, the difference would just be largely about whether elvish script and proper "full" sylvan are related by fey choices or by divine choices


[7/15/2024 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I like the 2nd


[7/15/2024 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
And to just expand, the fey then readopt the Elmerica-created writing system to use when they realize that the elves on the material plane can't really read what they are writing, due to lack of seeing the magic...

Although many elves can in fact natively detect magic, so perhaps it is more later, when the fey want to communicate with the non-elves, that this really starts to happen


[7/15/2024 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think the basic idea would be just that full sylvan script doesn't easily translate to the material plane. in the feywild, the determantives are obvious (if, sometimes, dangerous to read because they can put the unsuspecting reader into the mindset of the writer, which can theoretically mean a poem written by a powerful archfey might function like suggestion or charm person or other enchantment magic)


[7/15/2024 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
oh, I like that


[7/15/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but in the material plane, it requires special effort to read (maybe not just detect magic, but perhaps if you have the fey touched feat, or are a fey ranger subclass, or have an archfey patron, etc)


[7/15/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
(would still be dangerous to read on the material plane)


[7/15/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
right


[7/15/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
(if you can read it)


[7/15/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
so when the fey want to write for more "standard" reasons - send letters to followers on the material plane, etc - they adopt the Elmerica-derived elvish script to write


[7/15/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
in part because the main people they are communicating with are elves


[7/15/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
but in part because the reason for writing changes


[7/15/2024 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
right, I like that


[7/15/2024 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
i would probably lean into the magic aspect of the original sylvan alphabet, and make it very easy to read, like it wants to be understood, but very hard to write


[7/15/2024 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
(Although I would also suppose that fey often actually just not only write to their follows in the elvish alphabet, but in the elvish - or drankorian - or tyrwinghan - language itself, right?)


[7/15/2024 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, right, just many of their first followers were elves


[7/15/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
mechanically, i might consider:
(1) anyone who knows sylvan knows how to speak sylvan, how to read/write sylvan using elvish script, and how to read sylvan using the sylvan script, but not how to write the sylvan script
(2) the slyvan script can, in theory, be used to write any language, and it always somehow 'makes sense' to readers who can read that language in its native alphabet


[7/15/2024 12:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a question of - do the fey usually know lots of other languages? Is some powerful fey writing an order to an elvish follower in sylvan, but in the elvish script? or are they just writing in elvish?


[7/15/2024 12:21 PM] rsulfuratus
probably some of both, i think


[7/15/2024 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
The alternative idea I just had was that actually writing sylvan in other alphabets wasn't developed by the fey at all, but by fey-adjacent people (elves, tyrwinghans) as a way to try to communicate/understand/discuss sylvan


[7/15/2024 12:23 PM] .deciusmus
Especially if the sylvan script is magical and "Wants" to be read


[7/15/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
The fey just write in sylvan. Who cares after all? They can do it easily, and the elves and humans seem to be able to read it, and if some humans who read a fey love poem actually fall in love a little bit, well, good, that's the point of writing a love poem


[7/15/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
It's the humans/elves who start writing sylvan in other alphabets, to both be able to write it and to avoid the dangers of reading sylvan itself


[7/15/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
in a meeting now


[7/15/2024 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
one sec


[7/15/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
take your time, I gotta go fix a few bugs anyway


[7/15/2024 1:12 PM] rsulfuratus
so, summarizing, here is my take:
- The fey invent the language Sylvan, and the corresponding complex logo-syllabic script, during the mythic age, primarily as an art form, used to write poetry, songs, and stories. The script itself encodes this concern: it uses magical/emotional determinatives to communicate the emotional state of the writer, which changes the meaning of glyphs and as a secondary effect has a magical enchantment effect that is weaker or stronger depending on the magical power of the writer
- When Elmerica creates the elves, they *(actually not entirely sure about the gender or lack thereof of the Elven firstborn) also give the elves language (Elvish), and a writing system (the Elvish script), that is derived from the Sylvan script, but converted to a syllabary and stripped of the magical determinatives. The reasons for using the Sylvan script, as opposed to just invented something out of thin air, are left undetermined for the moment, just matters that this is what happened. 
- Over time, as the fey begin to interact with other people (non-fey), a few changes happen. First, the fey decide that sometimes writing is useful for things other than art, and that sometimes the magical weight of the fey script is not actually desirable. Second, some non-fey learn the Sylvan tongue (especially, early on, elves), but do not know how, or are not able, to write in the Sylvan script. This leads to the rapid development of an orthography for expressing Sylvan in the Elvish script
- The fey also, around this time, start to learn other languages. Sometimes they just write in the other language's script, but they also rapidly adapt the Sylvan script to other spoken languages, and the magic of the enchantment generally carries the meaning well enough


[7/15/2024 1:16 PM] rsulfuratus
this leads to the following modern day things:
- the Sylvan language, spoken by the fey, and written in either the (magical) sylvan script, or more typically in the Elvish script. most people who speak sylvan (or, anyway, most non-fey) cannot write in the sylvan script, but can read sylvan in both sylvan and elvish scripts, and write sylvan in elvish. The orthography of writing Sylvan in Elvish was largely invented by the elves as a way to write Sylvan, but functionally adopted by many fey, and probably involved some back and forth and probably is not totally standardized (e.g., like medieval english spelling), but for game-mechanical purposes this is probably irrelevant.
- the Sylvan script, originally used for writing the Sylvan language but since adapted to many other languages, which carries emotive weight, potential magic, and wants to be read so is usually understandable to speakers of the language
- the Elvish script, which is derived via Elmerica's intervention from the Sylvan script, was originally used to write Elvish, but is also the typical script that non-fey use to write Sylvan


[7/15/2024 1:26 PM] rsulfuratus
left undecided / open to feedback:
- is there an orthography of writing/reading sylvan in other scripts, that is does somewho who knows Sylvan automatically also know the Elvish script, or would they typically write Sylvan transliterated to e.g. Drankorian or Eastros alphabets? I'm fairly open either way to this. There are plenty of examples of real-world languages written in multiple scripts so totally plausible either way. I think the fey would never use anything other than Sylvan or Elvish scripts for written communication among themselves, though. However, a fey who wanted to write a message to a Tyrwinghan human could plausibly write Sylvan (in Sylvan, or Elvish, or Drankorian script, depending on their goals); write in Tyrwinghan or Common or Sembaran, using the standard alphabet; or write in Tyrwinghan/Common/Sembaran in Sylvan, if the magic was the goal
- mechanically, what does the language "Sylvan" imply. this would obviously depend on the game, but I would typically assume either: (a) speak Sylvan, write and read Sylvan with Elvish script; (b) speak Sylvan, write/read Sylvan with orthography of native language. But generally taking the language proficiency "Sylvan" should not generally give special ability to write Sylvan scripts.


[7/15/2024 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
A few quick comments, leaving aside the game mechanical for a moment.

I'm not totally sold on "you can write any language with the Sylvan script" and have it be understood. I'm more wondering if it should be something like: "the fey learned to add their emotional/magical determinatives to other orthographies".

Alternatively, it seems like it would be plausible to say that sylvan isn't really a specific set of glyphs at all, but something more magical than that, and its connection to a specific language kinda vague


[7/15/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
It seems weird to me to think that say the character:

Ah yeah actually I like the “fey can add determinatives to other scripts”

{Reactions}
👍

[7/15/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
Which implies that you don't need any special magic or anything to read sylvan writing. (although if you don't know the sylvan language, the fey would have to have been writing in your language)


[7/15/2024 1:36 PM] .deciusmus
but of course you should probably also be *cautious* about reading fey writing


[7/15/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
It's *writing* slyvan that is quite the trick for a non-fey to learn


[7/15/2024 1:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is a little more complicated. I guess what I was going for with the “want to be read” is two-fold. One, I think that it is probably relatively obvious visually when you are looking at “get writing”. Maybe a powerful archfey can disguise it, but you don’t typically pick up a random poem and then realize only after reading it that you are now charmed.


[7/15/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
Second, the fey script gives a lot of power to the writer. A fey missive can make itself subtly easier or harder to understand as the writer desires


[7/15/2024 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
So maybe it isn’t exactly that the Sylvan script is used to write other languages, but it is also not exactly the “normal” script, both visually and practically


[7/15/2024 1:40 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Agree with that as well. I actually think there are probably two different things going on here....

1) Fey writing, as a thing, is just somewhat magical, whatever language they are writing in, if they want it to be. So a fey can of course write a perfectly normal letter in Tyrwinghan. But they also can "embellish" it in some way, which would with some powerful/rare exceptions be obvious, which would give it an emotional power/magical spin


[7/15/2024 1:41 PM] .deciusmus
2) The writing system for Sylvan, that the fey created in the age of myth, is so intertwined with the idea of magical fey writing that it can't be understood without the embellishments


[7/15/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
So it goes something like....

The fey develop this magical form of written communication, where there are embedded emotions in the words, and their written language never disambiguates between certain concepts without the embedded emotion

Over time, you get:
a) a non-magical and simplified version of the fey writing (Elvish) which just represents phonemes/syllables like normal writing systems
b) fey learning to use their writing tricks on other languages


[7/15/2024 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
Which is, I think, kinda what you were saying as well?


[7/15/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I think that’s perfect


[7/15/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
One idea from Kiya.... True fey writing in Sylvan might be non-linear, i.e. the central concept of a poem might be inscribed large and in the middle, and additional words and context in concentric circles around it


[7/15/2024 2:04 PM] .deciusmus
Which might then in turn lead to Tyrwinghan art sometimes replicating the appearance of fey writing, without the magic


[7/15/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that


[7/15/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a few comments / edits / idea on the language doc, btw, it might be simpler to just post thoughts in Discord but could also add comments and push if you prefer the tracking aspect

[7/15/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
Re: "_Real world analog_: Undefined. Very few names or place names would be written in Common." I have tended to somewhat arbitrarily "translate" place names into effectively Common, to give a few familar anchors for things. The two examples that come to mind immediately are "Raven's Hold" and "Copper Hills", but also e.g. Green Sea, Endless Ocean, Sea of Storms, Sentinels. I think it is actually nice to sprinkle these in occasionally for practical and flavor reasons, especially if they have other, language-specific names (e.g., Labkah, Inalas for Sentinels)


[7/15/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't think this needs to be explicitly called out especially in a player facing language doc


[7/15/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
But my headcannon for why I don't bother making "native" names for everything is this is the Common translation


[7/15/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[7/15/2024 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I might make a note to this effect in the language doc as that will be the primary reference for practical naming of things


[7/15/2024 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
_Real world analog_: Modern English. Place or personal names written out (i.e. [[Copper Hills]] or [[Sentinel Range]] or [[Copperharps]] or [[Gemcrafters]]) should usually be read as being Common, in world.


[7/15/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
re: "_Alphabet_: Drankorian is written using the Drankorian alphabet". I'm not positive actually that there is a good reason for the Drankorian alphabet and the pre-Downfall urban Hkaran alphabet to be different. Maybe this doesn't really matter so much in practice, but there is a very close culturally continuity here that is maybe not precisely reflected in the documents. From the Drankorian point of view, of course, this is Drankorian, and especially from a present-day view


[7/15/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
I was inclined to preserve the possibility of old and mysterious Hkaran writing


[7/15/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but, I think that would be older


[7/15/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not positive...

[7/15/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
On the Drankorian language family, I'm not fully convinced that Sembaran should be thought of as a creole. I would actually potentially put Sembaran in the Eastros family, and have Sembaran and Tollish share a grammar but use vocabulary that is almost entirely derived from Drankorian. So they are kind of understandable if you concentrate to Isinguese or Cymeans, but like all the sentences might be backwards or something


[7/15/2024 2:50 PM] rsulfuratus
but they would not really be understandable to Skaer or others as the vocabulary is quite different


[7/15/2024 2:50 PM] .deciusmus
That works for me

Yeah, I like that a lot actually


[7/15/2024 2:53 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this fits with the history of the Mostreve hills being a long-standing political divide (e.g. even at its largest immediately pre-Great War Sembara never claimed kingship over Isingue) and establishes the Insiguese refugee community as a little bit more distinct, as they likely have a non-mutually-intelligible language as well as a sharped cultural break

if you agree I'm going to modify the language doc to fit this

my other thoughts are a little more vague. currently none of the northros languages use a "northros script"


[7/15/2024 2:57 PM] rsulfuratus
have a meeting now more later


[7/15/2024 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
yeah I didn't like the northros alphabets


[7/15/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
that should probably change


[7/15/2024 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i was going to suggest for northros, we could lean into it and argue that the original northros language was generally not written, which might push back the date of the first human migrations quite far into early Hkar (but, not necessarily a bad thing, given the quite distinct religious traditions) and would imply a few things about early hkar (e.g., lack of widespread literacy, since there is a writing system in place at the creation of humans - but if the ancestors of the northerners were largely illiterate it could work)

alternatively, i think that at least Deno'qai and Old Zimkovian should probably share an alphabet. Mawar probably adopts Drankorian writing as it is fairly culturally distinct from the northern folk religion cultures


[7/15/2024 3:13 PM] rsulfuratus
don't have strong feelings either way, could leave that undetermined for now. there is nothing particularly canonically decided about Deno'qai writing systems


[7/15/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
a few more random thoughts:
- I think potentially Chardonian has overtaken Drankorian as a scholarly language these days, and probably fewer and fewer scholars of the past two generations bother to learn Drankorian. It would not be quite as unusual as, say, learning Latin or Greek today in the real world, but it isn't anything like the prevalence of Latin in the Middle Ages. I think especially Mos Numena, without a real hierarchy or organization, is typically propogated in the local languages, and so there isn't a strong religious force to maintain a non-spoken language


[7/15/2024 3:29 PM] rsulfuratus
(pre Great War there is some impetus to maintain Drankorian as a kind of diplomatic language among the disparate city states of the west coast, but post Great War Chardonian becomes dominant)


[7/15/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
- it is a bit weird to have Old Zimkovan as a Northros language and Zimkovan as an Eastros language, primarily from a naming point of view. shouldn't it be called something else, by analogy to e.g. Old English vs Brittonic?


[7/15/2024 3:38 PM] .deciusmus
On Old Zimkovan vs Zimkovan: yes, definitely

[7/15/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
I was also planning on renaming most of the kestavo names to be more Arabic/Maltese sounding, the vibe being basically that the Zimka people, speaking an Eastros language, effectively reclaimed the cultural inheritance from the ~OldZimkovan~


[7/15/2024 3:39 PM] .deciusmus
but the gods names didn't change much


[7/15/2024 3:41 PM] .deciusmus
Sorta like if the Welsh & AngloSaxons had never converted to Christianity, and then during the Norman Conquest, lots and lots of Anglo-Saxons ended up in Wales where they then consciously reidentified themselves with the "British"

[7/15/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus

putting Sembaran and Tollish in Eastros works really well, it gives the Drankorian languages (diverging for ~700 years) a much simpler structure with only four languages, more or less (perhaps plus 1-2 more on the west coast), while the Eastros family (diverging for 2000+ years) has a lot more complexity

I’ve stated a little side project trying to reorganize the many different brainstorming docs out the broad historical outlines of taelgar into a single more canonical doc. Just fyi

{Reactions}
👍

[7/15/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
At the moment it’s mostly just moving stuff around. So far there are a couple of open questions:

1. Were the orcs created at the same time as the elder folk (as the main background history of Taelgar says) or were they created at the same time as humans and hobgoblins (as a mythic history brainstorming doc suggests)


[7/15/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
2. Should anything at all about the southerners (other than “they existed” be considered canonical?) I’d prefer to leave them out except as a “the southerners existed what happened to them tbd”


[7/15/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
3. Is there a firm date for the creation of humans?


[7/15/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
For (1), I don't think there is a canonical answer. I haven't spent much time on the history of the non-People of the Rainbow orcs. Either is plausible, and the metaphysics of how exactly the Void Mind and the Despairs etc work is not clear. There is a certain logic to having all the "elder folk/children of embodied divinities" appear at the same time, but I'm not sure there is a need to be fully committed to parallelism


[7/15/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I imagine this is not really known even among elven scholars -- even if the orcs were created early, they didn't really have a big impact until later -- so probably reasonable to leave it as unknown until more detail is needed. 

Certainly the people of the rainbow don't really maintain tales or myths from their chained days, and so for them their creation story is about the Cloudspinner


[7/15/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
For (2), per Milo's story, rumors of them surely exist in Chardon among other places. So it is more "they exist but no one really goes there because it is too hard so news is all garbled"


[7/15/2024 9:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I can just mention both possibilities with a “who knows what really happened”. Makes sense to me


[7/15/2024 9:42 PM] rsulfuratus
For (3), I think there should be but I'm not quite sure what it should be. Something like 1500-1700 maybe?


[7/15/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
There are dates ranging for 1500-2400 in various docs


[7/15/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
I was leaning toward something like 1750-1850


[7/15/2024 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
1850 gives ~2200 years of human culture before the downfall which feels about right


[7/15/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
Be a little earlier might also make sense? 1550 = 2500 years


[7/15/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
the religious history of taelgar doc has I think the most canonical thinking about pre-Downfall humanity, through a religious lens


[7/15/2024 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
(as an aside, did we ever finalize Deno'qai funerary traditions?)


[7/15/2024 9:50 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, for human history, I think that the "era of personal deities" feels like it could easily be 1000 years of relative stasis. not much arcane magic development, not much urbanization, pretty idyllic


[7/15/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
for dating, the only real information is that the philosopher's guild suggests the binding stones are more than 3000 years old


[7/15/2024 9:52 PM] .deciusmus
The only real thing we have is the  “traditions around death” doc


[7/15/2024 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
the events in described the philosopher's letter probably take place in the early pantheonic days, or perhaps the small gods era, hard to say precisely. but that puts that kind of transitory period at or before say ~2800


[7/15/2024 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
do we have dates for mariner migrations?


[7/15/2024 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus

Nothing canonical I think but I haven’t gotten that far and am not at my computer.


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
so mariner migrations must be a few hundred years before that at least


[7/15/2024 9:56 PM] rsulfuratus
probably more


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure we need to settle this tonight - i have more session prep to do anyway - but probably something like 1500-1700 is more correct for human origin than the later dates. 2400 is definitely too late, not enough history on Hkar before migrations IMO


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So let’s say 3500 or earlier. Probably first explorers 3300


[7/15/2024 9:57 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah agreed no need to settle right now


[7/15/2024 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
my vision of human history on Hkar is that it is largely driven by developments in magic. so when everyone has a personal deity things don't change much, everyone has a bit of magic that makes life pretty comfortable (although some people create curses and bring the nine hells into existence)


[7/15/2024 9:59 PM] rsulfuratus
this continues for a long while, potentially. but once arcane magic comes you get the rapid development of the hkar urban culture, the split with the mariners, etc


[7/15/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
But as a strawman maybe something like:

- 1500 creation
- 2250-2500 northerners
- 2800-2900 earliest pantheons
- 3300 - mariners start
- 3400 - mariners peak
- 3500 - mariners end


[7/15/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
But with the northerners and pantheon dates perhaps moved a bit or a lot


[7/15/2024 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, something like that is fairly reasonble as a rough starting point to work out. mariners might shift a bit later depending on how long it takes them to found tollen (not sure it would take 500 years to settle the length of the green sea, that seems a bit excessive)


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] .deciusmus
Sure. It depends on how long they spend mucking about in the magic islands having religious schisms


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
downfall is like 4100 or thereabouts


[7/15/2024 10:02 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure

It’s probably worth leaving the exact mariner dates a little vague in case we need more time for them wandered around in the far east

[7/16/2024 5:35 PM] .deciusmus
just playing around with this a bit, I think this timeline isn't quite right.  The idea is that there is explosive change in Hkar in the aftermath of the northerners leaving and encountering the Elder Folk, but 300-400 years for the development of the earliest pantheons seems too long


[7/16/2024 5:37 PM] .deciusmus
the only firm date we have is Sargon was defeated no later than ~2800. (So that the philosopher's "more than 3000 years ago" works). But no reason it couldn't have been 2500 or 2200 even, right?


[7/16/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, maybe the northerners left later? like 2600


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah any of those options works. Decision is about the balance of time in the various phases of hkaran history.  There are enough unknowns that it seems a bit hard to pin down


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
on the one hand, no reason to decide


[7/16/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
on the other hand, some arbitrary decisions help sometimes


[7/16/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
at the moment, I am thinking something like:

~300 years of "personal deities" era. 
~700 years of "small gods" era

Northerner migration is the ending of the small god era

~200 years of rapid change

~1500 years of the pantheonic era


[7/16/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not really sure if that is right. It's hard to know how rapidly the pantheonic era should conslidate


[7/16/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
into Mos Numena


[7/16/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I think one consideration is that to a certain extent, this plays into the question of why the downfall happens. 

The original conception from high school was supposed to be kind of opposed to the Tolkien mythic history of "humans are punished for challenging the gods" type thing. So the Downfall doesn't happen because humans get greedy, it happens because of evil gods or the Void Mind or whatever tbd forces. It happens to humans, basically, more like a natural disaster. 

I think this, to a certain extent, argues for a relatively shorter pantheonic era. If the Void Mind is trying to stop humans, the Hkaran urban elite is developing high magic and cooperating with elves, why wait?


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I mean, I definitely like the vibe of the Downfall as a "from the outside" disaster


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
But the Void Mind might need to wait to gain strength


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, there are possible reasons why it could happen anytime, of course


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. grow the hobgoblin armies in secret or whatever


[7/16/2024 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
If the Sargon date is going to stay canonical there isn't really room to make the pantheonic era much shorter than 1500 years


[7/16/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Because I think it should definitely be true that the transition from small gods to pantheons is short


[7/16/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think it makes a ton of sense for their to be a long period of "proto pantheons" that Sargon can fit into. Right?


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
well, what there is no information about is what the Chainshroud actually was. Sarqon could be a full-fledged god worshipped by a cult.


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
I guess Sargon could be a 'big small god'


[7/16/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
The other constraint is that the northern migration needs time, once it happens, to spread across Taelgar and diversify


[7/16/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
So I think the northerners can't be too early


[7/16/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
* i mean too late


[7/16/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, my thought is that there is effectively one period of rapid change in Hkar: the evolution from small gods to big pantheonic gods.

And that this period of rapid change should be:
* Short (100 - 300 years, but probably closer to 100 than 300)
* Soon after the Northerners leave and the humans and Elder Folk start interacting


[7/16/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
So, rereading the religious history doc, I feel like the era of personal deities/cults and the early pantheonic stages could last for quite a long time. the small gods -> pantheons does need to happen quickly


[7/16/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
for example, I'm not sure why "In a variety of ways, the era of cults quickly becomes an era of small gods. It likely starts with ancestor worship - if your mother was a powerful divine sorcerer, and you benefitted from her personal deity in life, it would be very natural to continue praying to her personal deity in death." has to be true


[7/16/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, the era of cults is kind of undeveloped


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I'm not sure it matters when the transition from personal deities to cults is


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Similarly, the transition from "early pantheonic" to "proto-Mos-Numena" can be anytime


[7/16/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
what does seem clear is that the small gods is an important but brief transitory period, and a lot of things happen:
- northern migrations
- contact with elder folk
- arrival of arcane magic in force


[7/16/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
The thing that impacts everything else is basically when does the small gods -> early pantheonic transition happen


[7/16/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure if the small gods period has to be brief. You could have a short cult phase and a long small god phase, for example


[7/16/2024 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
so there are actually some conflicted metaphysics about the outer planes and the religious history docs


[7/16/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., where do places like Arborea and the Nine Hells come from? they are supposed to be kind of inchoate belief from the early days but this conflicts a bit with the idea that it isn't until the early pantheonic days that people start imaging  extraplanar divinities


[7/16/2024 6:02 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, that is neither here nor there for dating


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
in my mind, the northerner migration, contact with elder folk, spread of arcane magic, and the pantheonic tradition are all tied together and happen in a relatively short window


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. Strongly agree


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
say within about 200-500 years max


[7/16/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/16/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
so how much history is about right for the northerners on the main continent?


[7/16/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
And of course this needs to be during the "small gods" era, but it could be that small gods only lasts 200-300 years and overlaps almost entirely with the "transition" period.

Or it could be that small gods lasts 1000 years and ends with the migrations


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
There needs to be enough time that Zimka/Vos are well established in Sembara when the mariners show up


[7/16/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
I think that's the main constraint really


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
it doesn't necessarily take the northerners that much time to get there


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
But the world isn't _that_ big. It could probably be as little as 800 years and as many as 1800


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
which says, say 2100 - 3100


[7/16/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if Tollen is founded in 3902 that implies mariners make it to Western Gulf by say 3700 at the earliest? Tollen is supposed to be one of the first mariner cities in that part of the Green Sea


[7/16/2024 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
I was using the founding of Tollen as the function "point of contact" but probably 100 years before is better


[7/16/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
give the Zimka like 8-10 generations minimal in the highlands before then only pushes their arrival back to 3100ish? plus/minus a hundred years


[7/16/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
sorry wrong math, more like 3400


[7/16/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so assume very roughly 800-1000 years to migrate, you could have northerns make first contact with continent around 2400-2600


[7/16/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Although I think 1000 years is a very long time to migrate. There are all kinds of reasons they might have been moving faster


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right but doesn't mess anything up for them to have been in the region for 20-30 generations, or 100 generations


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
I'd stick with my the migration should probably not be before 2000 or after 3000 but anything else could work


[7/16/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
yes I think that is good


[7/18/2024 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
Did you push any notes on this yet?


[7/18/2024 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
in the history-rewrite branch


[7/18/2024 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
I didn't want to do it in main because I was doing a lot of deleting and moving wanted to be able to review a diff to make sure I deleteing the right stuff


[7/18/2024 10:18 AM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure if I got this exactly captured


[7/18/2024 10:19 AM] .deciusmus
I have a session in 1.5 weeks and am mostly switching my taelgar focused stuff to session prep for a bit


[7/18/2024 10:34 AM] rsulfuratus
I need to finally actually develop drankor ha ha so working on a lot of history over the next couple of weeks, fwiw


[7/18/2024 10:35 AM] .deciusmus
you should definitely look at my history-rewreite


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i am tempted to rewrite a little to move away from the Tolkien-esque "elder folk" "elder days" "ages of the world" framework


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
I was pretty tempted to get rid of the whole "5th age"


[7/18/2024 10:48 AM] rsulfuratus
right, that seems pointless. it was originally an idea for elven timekeeping before we came up with the ka cycle


[7/18/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
right, I guess with the ka cycle why would elves have some different "ages" concept? i mean, I guess you might refer to some set of ka by a name, but that would be very elvish


[7/18/2024 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
so really, you can imagine a mythic structure that is basically

"Time before time"
"Time before humans"
"History"


[7/18/2024 10:51 AM] .deciusmus
But it might be good to have a term to refer to the first two categories... whether that uses the word "Age" I'm not sure


[7/18/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
well, i guess the real idea is that from a metaphysical point of view, there is just the "Mythic Age" (before time) and "History". but that doesn't mean that scholars wouldn't make up names. So from a human point of view, you might have the Hkaran Era and the Drankorian Era


[7/18/2024 10:52 AM] rsulfuratus
and humans might actually consider the Mythic Age to be everything pre-existence of humans


[7/18/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I was thinking from the perspective of a Drankorian scholar you'd have

the time before time
the time before humans
the Hkaran Era
the current time

from the perspective of a Chardonian scholar, you'd add

the time before time
the time before humans
the Hkaran Era
the Drankorian Era
the current time

but actually the real dividing point is probably the fall of Drankor, not the fall of Cha'mutte


[7/18/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
from a "making stuff up" point of view, the difference between the time before humans the Hkaran Era is small


[7/18/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. in many ways the world building history is easier if we don't think of the creation of humans as some "New Age!!!" but just an event


[7/18/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
that avoids eg feeling like the timing of orcs or hobgoblins has to be related to some "age transition"


[7/18/2024 10:56 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, I think from a worldbuilding perspective there are really three substantial eras:
- before the planes are separated by the Riving
- between the Riving and the Downfall
- between the Downfall and the current day


[7/18/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
right


[7/18/2024 10:58 AM] rsulfuratus
I think that the Age of Myth, the Age of Creation, and the Age of Humanity are reasonable worldbuilding internal names but each could conceivably have different names in different cultures as well, tbd. to the extent to which we want to invest in that kind of worldbuilding.


[7/18/2024 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
right. that probably makes sense too, and is a slightly different dividing line (i.e. presuming the Age of Creation ends with the creation of Humans)


[7/18/2024 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
or you could imagine the Age of Humanity divided into the Hkaran Era, the Drankorian Era, and the post-Drankorian Era


[7/18/2024 11:00 AM] .deciusmus
again, from a worldbuilding-internal naming standpoint mostly


[7/18/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
one idea I had that i'm not sure about is that the downfall is actually the end of the age of creation, and rather than having a bunch of "void mind" races lingering in the shadows and growing in strength for a thousand years, you basically have wars break out kind of suddenly, and really have for the first time in history (since the riving) the concept of large scale war.


[7/18/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
the downfall is basically the last gasp of the void mind to destroy the work of the age of creation


[7/18/2024 11:03 AM] rsulfuratus
and something about the downfall is actually significantly more mythically/metaphysically real, it locks into a place a bunch of metaphysics and further restricts magic in some way. maybe moving the outer planes even further from the material plane or something.


[7/18/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea of downfall being metaphysically significant... but I also like the elves having this long period of wariness and empire building... and the current semi-canon for the dwarven split is those who want to fortify the underground vs those who want to flee the underground


[7/18/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
So there could be advantages to having a long slow buildup


[7/18/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
If gnomes only left in the 200 years before the downfall or something they should be more well known across taelgar, right?


[7/18/2024 11:07 AM] rsulfuratus
i guess my thought is those kinds of premonitions are more interesting if it is really a magical thing: elmerica is warning the elves of something new, all consuming war, that the that world has never seen; maybe before this time the Warrior of the Bahrazel is something else, not the Warrior, and it is during this time a cult of the Warrior grows up among the dwarves, some thinking this is dangerous and terrible and others believing their crazy stories


[7/18/2024 11:08 AM] rsulfuratus
the dangerous and terrible folks lose and leave, and dwarven society starts inventing armies


[7/18/2024 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
Right, I don't disagree, but it seems odd to have the premonitions 1000 years before anything bad happens


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
Even elves aren't going to plan for 1000 years in the future


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
no, but the firstborn don't know when exactly something bad is going to happen


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
its like e.g. early christian predictions about the end of the world or something


[7/18/2024 11:09 AM] .deciusmus
right, I mean, if the premonitions start in 2000 and the wars don't erupt until 3800 that's a long time to be having faith in the premonitions


[7/18/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
It has a very different flavor than the premonitions start in 2000 and are proven true in 2150 or 2200


[7/18/2024 11:10 AM] .deciusmus
in, actually, a not dissimilar way to christian evolution of the end of the world as being seen as less and less "mainstream" as it kept not happening


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
doesn't mean that can't be what happened, I just think it changes the flavor in a way I'm not sure I love


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
sure, yes, this is part of why the downfall is so bad. if all of elven society believed that war was going to break out in 100 years they'd have been better prepared and all their empires wouldn't have been lost


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
thats a good point


[7/18/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
the circle I'm trying to square is basically how badly the non-humans lose


[7/18/2024 11:12 AM] rsulfuratus
i mean obviously on some level they win but at massive cost. so why weren't they more prepared?


[7/18/2024 11:16 AM] .deciusmus
What if you have something like...
(a) Both the dwarven and elven firstborn have these major premonitions of disaster, but like, in 2000 or even 1500. A long time before the downfall wars
(b) At first, both societies largely accept them, and start preparing for war
(c) After a hundred years of nothing happening, starts to be schisms. Gnomes split. Disagreement amongst the elves
(d) Say after another hundred years, small cracks that let in creatures from the Far Realms into the deeps start to appear
(e) this is nothing "earth shattering" and doesn't really impact elves at all, but it is enough to entrench the dwarven warrior thruh and it becomes this kinda smallish group who defends the deep from the occasional aberration


[7/18/2024 11:17 AM] .deciusmus
Then 1000+ years pass, and the elves who accept the possibility of danger have become something like a small cult of sorts, the watchers or whatever


[7/18/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
Probably needs a bit of work, but I feel like the "isolated watchers not quite believed" works better for elves than dwarves


[7/18/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
Not sure what stoneborn/halflings/lizardfolk are doing all this time


[7/18/2024 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
yes. in my sentient ocean history, canonically the riving is supposed to open cracks to the far realms, and while it would in theory take some time for e.g. mind flayers to show up those make sense as the "first enemies"


[7/18/2024 11:23 AM] rsulfuratus
I like this. you also have things like undead, and maybe lycanthropy, and a few other evils. greedy dragons and the like, and maybe some remnant giant populations who see small folk as lesser. so it isn't like the world is missing conflict. but you really don't have "war", except deep in the underdark where dwarves fight mind flayers and other strange aberrations


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
there is just enough danger so that the watcher elves or whatever aren't completely unbelievable, but the idea that a few undead or a greedy dragon would spawn vast armies seems difficult to believe


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
And in particular, nothing like the "First Age of Elves on Middle Earth in the long fortified war against Morgoth" vibe


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] rsulfuratus
yes


[7/18/2024 11:24 AM] .deciusmus
I like that


[7/18/2024 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
One thought. Does the Void Mind lose because of the efforts of the firstborn races, or is it something else?

Is the Void Mind winning until somehow a trap is set on Hkar, and massive armies of hobgoblins and orcs and whatever else all sail to Hkar and then the place is sunk to destroy the armies?

Or is the "mainland" battles more even, or at least not quite so hopeless?


[7/18/2024 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
What if there is something specific about Hkar that empowers the divine spark


[7/18/2024 11:28 AM] rsulfuratus
I've always kind of imaged the destruction of Hkar as a trap, yes


[7/18/2024 11:29 AM] rsulfuratus
but nothing canonical in this regard


[7/18/2024 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
Here's an alternative idea though...

When the Divine Presence creates Hkar + the humans, there is literally something metaphysical of themselves that is embedded in Hkar or a part of Hkar. This strengthens and empowers the divine spark in the humans.

During the Downfall Wars, the agents of the Void Mind learn of this, and realize if they can possess and corrupt this whatever, they can destroy and corrupt everything that was imagined with the divine spark, perhaps even humanity itself, and dramatically weaken the Divine Prescene. End the ability to create, at some level.


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
And although the battle is still raging, and the Void Mind forces haven't won, it is too much of a risk. And so the Divine Prescence takes back this whatever which sinks Hkar


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
And metaphysically, makes them farther away from Taelgar, and makes the creation of new gods harder


[7/18/2024 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
weakens divine magic.


[7/18/2024 11:35 AM] rsulfuratus
i think there is something in that


[7/18/2024 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
i think actually that cleans up a lot of the complications of the outer planes -- e.g. why is their a fixed set of outer planes and why are some not associated with deities?


[7/18/2024 11:36 AM] .deciusmus
It needs work, I think, but it plays back into the idea that the earlier and closer the humans are to Hkar, the easier it is to create gods. This explains why there are not so many new religions always forming (and maybe even the mariners too something of this power with them, which is why the east has more divine magic and more religions in general)


[7/18/2024 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not totally sure I want to say that *no* new gods appear after the downfall, but I think it works very well to have an "easy" era of god formation transition to a "hard" era. and that no new *planes* are formed after the downfall, perhaps excepting divine realms


[7/18/2024 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
(although metaphyiscally I think divine realms and non-divine outer planes are somewhat distinct)


[7/18/2024 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
and making that power embedded in the physical location of Hkar itself works well to explain Hkar's destruction


[7/18/2024 11:39 AM] .deciusmus
Right and it could explain some of the earliest outer planes


[7/18/2024 11:39 AM] rsulfuratus
and also perhaps why the elven empire that was in dunmar gets decimated. hobgoblin armies cut down hundreds of thousands of trees to construct a massive armanda


[7/18/2024 11:40 AM] .deciusmus
maybe in the first generation of humans, born themselves with the divine spark, and living on Hkar at the center of this magic literalyl create planes with their dreams. 

So places like Abyss/Hell/Aborea are the planes created by the dreams of the very first generation of humans.


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
then *populated* by the divine familiars created by the later generations?


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
not sure about that...


[7/18/2024 11:41 AM] .deciusmus
right, I like that


[7/18/2024 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
I gotta go do some work. but the other thing to think about is the vibe of the elves & other firstborn races....

At the end of the Downfall wars is it more like:

that was terrible but we won by our actions OR

that was terrible and we would have all been wiped out if Hkar didn't sink


[7/18/2024 11:42 AM] .deciusmus
(my instinct says the first is better, but not sure)


[7/18/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
I think my idea of the vibe of the downfall based on this new idea of the void mind wanting to corrupt hkar is that "without our actions, hkar would have been overwhelmed, but ultimately without the sinking of hkar the war could never have ended"

{Reactions}
👍

[7/18/2024 11:47 AM] rsulfuratus
so basically, destruction of hkar was a necessary cost, but without the price paid by the firstborn, probably the armies that reached hkar would have achieved their goal and captured the divine spark or whatever before hkar could be destroyed. something like that


[7/18/2024 11:48 AM] rsulfuratus
i have a bunch of meetings this afternoon but am going to try to rewrite the history of taelgar doc on the rewrite branch with these ideas

{Reactions}
👍

[7/18/2024 2:27 PM] rsulfuratus
have not got very far due to actual work, but throwing out this thought for comment, will likely pick up some more on this later today.

i think that the extraplanar geography needs a bit of rearranging. 

energy realms make total sense and I like the traditional D&D 5e Elemental Planes. The ethereal plane and the plane of magic connect nicely here. 

echo realms make total sense as well, although the shadowfell might need a little bit of thought. it isn't obvious that fey need two planes, and it is a natural locus for undead, so might make more sense as an undead plane in a sense, but need to think about that in the context of the metaphysics of death. 

however i'm increasingly feeling like the outer planes don't really work. there are canonically as many as perhaps four categories of "outer planes":
(1) the realms of the embodied gods, of which the dwarven Heart of the Mountain is the most well established
(2) the realms of incorporeal gods, of which Shakun's realm is the clearest, but which also canonically are not always a separate realm for each deity, e.g. Arkaash is supposed to be the realm of the Dunmari Pantehon
(3) what I've called the "primal realms": Arborea, the Abyss, Pandemonium, others. These are explicity not associated with deities, or at least not with the Divine Presence (but e.g. Pandemonium might be associated with Jinnik)
(4) the Dreamworld, the Land of the Dead, the Plane of Souls don't fit obviously into this, although it is canonically established that you can reach the Dreamworld via the Plane of Souls, and the Land of the Dead is a "dividing line" somehow for divine power
(5) the Astral Plane, which might not even exist? Or might be connected to the Plane of Souls and/or the Dreamworld


[7/18/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
I think probably separating out the Primal Realms (with perhaps a different name) and associating these with the Riving, perhaps involving some Void Mind shenanigans, is much more straightforward than trying to force these things into the Divine Realms / Spiritual Realms


[7/18/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
then the embodied gods, incorporeal gods, dreamworld, land of dead, plane of souls are all "Age of Creation" things layered on top of the metaphysical structure created by the RIving


[7/18/2024 2:31 PM] rsulfuratus
and this also potentially creates space for e.g. undead to leak from the shadowfell, or lycanthropes from Pandemonium, or demons from the Abyss, in the age of creation


[7/18/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
I found the early campaign “hell is made by humans because you imagine it” vibe kinda appealing. But it is potentially hard to fit into a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 2:33 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean there doesn't have to be a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
I’ve never been happy with Shadowfell, honestly and it seems kinda odd. Didn’t you run a one shot for Riswynn in the Shadowfell or was that somewhere else?


[7/18/2024 2:35 PM] rsulfuratus
the way the shadowfell has worked so far is not as a permanent echo realm but more like "domains of dread" like Ravenloft. mini-echo-realms created by some powerful trauma/evil/whatever


[7/18/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
so it is kind of like fey domains in that the boss controls the vibe and the terrain echoes the material world, but very unlike in that you generally can't straightforwardly just walk across the borders


[7/18/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
and theoretically you could have mulitple overlapping shadowfell domains echoing the same spot


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that is more interesting and consistent with taelgar metaphysics than any kind of permanent equivalent of the feywild just in reverse


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but still thinking


[7/18/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i have a meeting now but more later


[7/18/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
RIght I like that a lot - Shadowfell per se doesn't exist, and perhaps there isn't even a specific word/language/culture/whatever.... But there are a bunch of shadowy/dark echo realms, with a kind-of anti-life vibe...

That fits well with Delwath's backstory as well


[7/18/2024 2:43 PM] .deciusmus
A few thoughts for later..

(1) Agree on energy realms / plane of magic / etheral plane from the Riving
(2) Agree on Shadowfell not fey & not a thing but more a type of mini-echo realm
(3) Not sure about undead. Do undead really need a plane? It seems to me that they are very much a material plane phenomena. Doesn't mean a vampire or lich couldn't create a "shadowfell" domain of dread, but I don't think that the undead really need a "home plane" in any sense
(4) Agree that the core "divine" realms and the core "primal" realms should be thought of separately. 
(5) Agree that the Dreamworld/Land Of Dead/Plane of Souls needs separate thought


[7/18/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Some questions:

(a) how does a divine realm come to be? I don't know the answer but my instinct says that the embodied gods & the incorporeal gods probably create them the same way. I think if it is in some sense under the gods control that explains a lot of the differences, i.e. Shakun created her own realm for Reasons rather than joining the realm of the Dunmari family, which was one realm for Reasons. 
(a - 1) if the gods create the divine realms, that kinda means that until the pantheonic era, there were no divine realms for humans
(a - 2) how does this relate to souls, which are pretty well established as "returning to their deity" after death in some fashion
(a - 3) how does this relate to small gods ideas of death, where there is no divine realm?
(a - 4) what about Thark and other embodied void mind gods. Can they create divine realms as well?


[7/18/2024 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
(b) What is the Plane of Souls / Dreamworld / Land of Dead and when was it created? 

The canon we have so far suggests that the Plane of Souls and Dreamworld are closely connected, and also closely connected to the *living*. The plane of souls is like an echo realm almost, but just echoing the souls of those who are alive on taelgar. (Maybe it is an echo realm, creating in the Riving?)

The Dreamworld is has very little canon to it, other than as a place of imagination/dreams/possibilities. I used it in my game once as a place where the party was trapped during a cursed sleep. 

Here's what we wrote in college, which actually still feels kinda right:

The Dreamworld: The Dreamworld is an echo, shadow, and premonition of Taelgar.  The Dreamworld is a realm that contains echoes of the present, past, and future blended together.  Prophecy, and the ability to sense the past associations of an object are strongly tied to connections to the Dreamworld.  The Dreamworld can also, under the influence of a powerful master, be used to send messages, influence dreams, and similar things.  It is at once a part of, and not a part of, Taelgar.


[7/18/2024 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
So thinking about this a bit when I should be working it feels like metaphysically, the Plane of Souls and the Dreamworld are really a sort of echo realm, and probably created in the Riving, and actually might be very different from the land of the dead


[7/18/2024 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure this long stream of conscious is helpful, but what about something like the following....

(1) In the aftermath of the Riving, the planes are separated, and at least the Energy Realms, Ethereal Realm, Plane of Magic, and the Echo Realms (including the Feywild, the Dreamworld, the Plane of Souls, plus any other random planes like the Mirror Realm and the rumored Nightmare Realm) are created. Plus of course the Material Plane

(2) the embodied gods create their divine realms as they see fit, as they are created. TBD is what about the Void Mind gods, and can they create realms to? Probably yes, but they might not all want to, given the void mind vibe.

(3a) maybe the Land of the Dead is explicitly created as a buffer between the gods and Taelgar during the Downfall, in response to the Void Mind attacks? That could be a mechanism for explaining why it became harder for belief to create gods. (Although this might be too big a change and not quite fit the already established religious history). (3b) Alternatively, maybe the Land of the Dead is in some sense part of the creation of humans. So before the land of the dead, the firstborn souls were taken up by their gods directly from Taelgar.


[7/18/2024 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like the implications of (3b) that unleashing the divine spark into the multiverse had other consequences


[7/18/2024 3:30 PM] .deciusmus
Ok..here's a story. What do you think?

In the beginning, magic was all there was. In the Age of Myth before time, there was no life or death, per se, no mortality, and no souls. Magic fueled everything, and time didn't have meaning. Everything that lived at this time was in some sense a being of pure magic.

Then, in the Riving, as the magic of the multiverse was being ordered into the Energy & Ethereal & Magic Planes, the Divine introduced something new: souls. Not made of magic, but something else, that have never existed before.

And the embodied gods & the plane of souls were both shaped out of soul stuff, this new thing. And the embodied gods used the power of their soul stuff to guide and create living beings from the soul stuff in the plane of souls, and shape a new kind of life. As the first souls died, and drifted back to the plane of souls, the embodied gods recognized their work, and swept their souls up, and built realms for them, also out of soul stuff


[7/18/2024 3:35 PM] .deciusmus
This continued for a while (and as an aside, Thark fits in nicely here as perverse creation, not really made of soul stuff at all, not properly, and so he is only able to steal the soul stuff from the other gods and chain and bind it, not create it himself)...

And then the Divine created humans. Humans were a new thing again, made of soul stuff but without a creator or guide, with the power of their soul stuff to shape things intact, rather than skimmed by the embodied gods (this sounds like I'm making Cha'mutte's point, embodied gods as leechs)...

And the Divine made the land of the dead for them, so the human soul stuff could have a place to go when it died. And when the early humans died, before their were any gods, they imagined out of their own soul stuff, the primal realms


[7/18/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
So the history of the planes is basically 3 events:

(a) the Riving establishes the Echo/Energy/Ethereal Realsm
(b) in the same moment as the Riving, the creation of souls establishes the Plane of Souls (and the Dreamworld, which is basically an echo plane of the Plane of Souls)
(c) at the time of creation of humans, the Land of the Dead is created

Then, all the "outer" planes (Primal + Spiritual) are built either by human belief, with the power of their soul-stuff, or by embodied or incorporeal gods, with the power of the soul-stuff of their dead followers

In the early days, the human souls were not flowing to any gods, so the primal planes came to be. But then, as the gods developed, human soul-stuff became more and more a purview of the gods, rather than free-floating human belief.

But in theory, metaphysically, if all the humans decided to stop believing/worshipping the gods, you'd go back to a time when human belief could create new primal planes


[7/18/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
need to think about this all a bit but a few additional points:
(1) Agree that that Dreamworld is functionally an echo realm of the Plane of Souls - I think this has been established in game already, early on actually in Kenzo's dream journey way back in Karawa. The key distinction between the Dreamworld and what I would call true echo realms is that the geography of the Dreamworld is not tied to the physical geography of the material plane. Shadowfell domains, the Feywild, and the MIrror Realm have, so far, been demonstrated to be geographic echoes (distorted perhaps) of the Material Plane
(2) Agree that the Land of the Dead is a dividing line of sorts, between the Plane of Souls / Material Plane / echo realms / whatever and the Divine Realms. This is established as well, at least in my secret notes if not in game, and is consistent with a lot of undead lore and lore around resurrection/raise dead etc. (it takes much stronger magic to bring back a soul that has 'passed on')


[7/18/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Not positive I agree that the Land of the Dead is a human thing / created originally for humans, and need to think about the primal realms as imagined by dead humans out of their soul stuff


[7/18/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure I agree with any of the above either; its more one potential idea that at least has a unifying mechanic


[7/18/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Going back to your questions, re: how does a divine realm come to be, I think this is "it is created by a divinity" and that the distinction between embodied and incorporeal gods here is not particularly meaningful. 

How this relates to souls and dead is, I think, fairly clear in my mind as well. The "Spiritual Realms" writ large are basically places where souls can exist, and if they don't eventually end up in one of the "Spiritual Realms", they fade from existence into nothingness. 

Re: Thark, at least in some sense this has to be yes, otherwise orcs from last session wouldn't believe they could poison him with their souls.


[7/18/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there is an unresolved question about the souls of humans who are not taken up by one of the major divinities with an extraplanar realm, and I think there is still an unresolved question about where the non-god-associated spiritual realms come from


[7/18/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
Re: Thark, I'm not sure Thark has to be able to create a divine realm for orcs to believe they can poison him, right? He just has to have some type of existence that is in  place they can reach him. Although a divine realm is probably simplest


[7/18/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
re: echo realms.

My thinking is that an echo realm is just a echo of the Riving, and, in some sense, could be an echo of something other than Taelgar. So the Dreamworld is an echo of the creation of the plane of souls or whatever.

Is it necessary to assume all echo realms are an echo of the plane of taelgar? Maybe dragons all live in some echo of the plane of magic.


[7/18/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
What's different about the echo realms is they are sorta created by accident. 

Whereas the energy realms are the separation of the stuff of the multiverse from before the Riving.

And the spiritual realms are created by divine beings, on purpose.

(primal realms TBD)


[7/18/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Agree on Echo realms vs Energy realms as you describe - no not all echo realms need to echo the material plane


[7/18/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I think "primal realms" is the wrong word FWIW, at least in some old notes I have 
Arcane magic = Energy realms, plane of magic
Divine magic = Spiritual Realms, Divine Presence
Primal magic = Echo realms, resonances of the Riving


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
Interesting


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
but I agree


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
not committed to that as canonical but it is interesting and fits in at least with some centaur lore


[7/18/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
"outer planes" is the best shorthard term for now, but clearly not the right taelgaresque term


[7/18/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. At some point we need to clarify a bit what fey magic is. Because eventually Kiya is going to want to know exactly how Celyn feels different when he casts a fey spell vs a divine spell


[7/18/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
But putting that aside, I agree that primal is the wrong word.


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Re: magic, I actually think in some ways my older notes are wrong, and there is no reason for such broad generalizations. All magic on Taelgar is the manipulation of extraplanar energy, yes. But mechanically, any player who cares can choose some reasonable source of extraplanar energy to be what they manipulate


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
I didn't mean to suggest that "primal" = "rangers and druids"


[7/18/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Or at least, I didn't read it that way


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
More, I was thinking you meant "there is a 3rd kind of magical ressonance, from the echo realms, which is a different type of magic than arcane or divine"


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
in our high school notes we called this "the magic of Taelgar"


[7/18/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, but what I'm suggesting is the idea that there are three categories is maybe wrong


[7/18/2024 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
"Plane of Magic" magic and "Pray to Deity" magic are the most common and easiest, perhaps. But "feywild magic", "elemental plane magic", and "other outer plane" magic could all exist


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so if you wanted to play a storm sorcerer or something maybe you don't use traditional "arcane" magic from the plane of magic, but use "elemental magic" from the elemental planes


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
or a circle of dreams druid maybe uses "dreamworld magic"


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
right, I see.


[7/18/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[7/18/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, a bit far afield from the original discussion. still going to try to type up the history notes, and maybe will try to incorporate some comments on the extraplanar stuff as `%% %%` notes


[7/18/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking about making a stab at updating the cosmology section briefly with this


[7/18/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure if we've agreed to anything


[7/18/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
perhaps just that Dreamworld/land of dead don't belong in Spiritual relams and that the Riving created at least

(a) energy + magic + ethereal
(b) dreamworld + plane of souls

And that the divine spiritual realms were crated by gods, separately
and that the primal realms should be renamed but we don't have a good alternate name


[7/18/2024 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
Also perhaps that the Shadowfell has nothing to do with the fey


[7/18/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe add some notes to the overall multiverse page. i'm not sure anything is settled enough to be worth revising the organization of the cosmology section yet


[7/18/2024 5:10 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is something to be said for "de-canonifying" the current division, i.e. by 
- moving stuff that isn't definitely a spirtual realm out of spiritual realms
- getting rid of "primal realms" as a catagory


[7/18/2024 5:11 PM] .deciusmus
might play around in a PR-branch


[7/18/2024 6:33 PM] rsulfuratus
working a bit more on this and wondering about this:

The Riving is actually several ordered events, although the time between them is undefined as the linear progression of time doesn't really make sense until the Riving ends:

1) The Divine Presence separates the material plane from the energy and echo realms, making a place that, while not devoid of magic, is much more stable and safe.

2) The Divine Presence spins out from itself the raw material for souls, which are basically like little fragments of the divine, creating the Plane of Souls as a kind of undifferentiated swirl. 

3) The Divine Presence creates out of itself the Embodied Gods, and gives them the power to shape soul stuff, but creates the land of the dead as a barrier, limiting the ability of souls to influence the Divine Presence or act beyond the material plane. 

4) The Embodied gods use the soul stuff to create the elves, dwarves, etc, and create their personal domains beyond the land of the dead. This ends the Riving and starts the Age of Creation.


[7/18/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, the creation of humanity is the moment when the Divine Presence allows a break in the Land of the Dead. Humanity is given the divine spark to shape divinity. The incorporeal gods are created because of this barrier.


[7/18/2024 6:34 PM] rsulfuratus
The Downfall seals this barrier again, but quite completely


[7/18/2024 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
Actually implies separating the world out into four mythic eras again, with creation of humans as a dividing line, but I think neatly wraps some things up


[7/18/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
The period of time betwen the Creation of Humans and the Downfall is a period when it is relatively easy to create "outer planes". 

Some are created by human beliefs. Some are created by the Void Mind's agents, descendants, etc. Some maybe are created by strange and unlikely events.


[7/18/2024 6:37 PM] rsulfuratus
Afterward, after the Downfall, the metaphysical world is largely fixed. But the barrier is not **completely** sealed, to leave open the possibility of weird stuff, new gods, as needed


[7/18/2024 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
I like the first part, but I don't think it needs to be a set of linearly ordered events exactly. Is causality even unidirectional in the Age of Myth? Aerin going back to before the Riving somehow creates kenku, right? Who says that order has meaning?


[7/18/2024 6:38 PM] .deciusmus
But sure, from a "untangling for ease of understanding" I like it


[7/18/2024 6:38 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, I guess for ease of human minds to understand it makes sense to say in some way creation of the plane of souls and creation of embodied gods has to precede the creation of the elder folk but in metaphysical reality causality doesn't have to be unidirection


[7/18/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
So the mythic history becomes:

all magic, no souls
soul stuff created, but its influence is locked to Taelgar itself
door opened, soul stuff can influence the metaverse
oops, that's too dangerous, patch it up by the door can never be fully closed


[7/18/2024 6:41 PM] rsulfuratus
basically, yes


[7/18/2024 6:42 PM] rsulfuratus
what I like about it is that it allows for any random "outer plane" someone wants to make, and no reason for it fit into a unified metaphysics


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
Right so basically an “outer plane” is just something created with soul stuff at some level


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
But each outer plane can / should have a specific origin story


[7/18/2024 6:44 PM] .deciusmus
I like that a lot actually


[7/18/2024 6:45 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that I would the astral plane basically the undifferentiated soulstuff beyond the land of the dead (while the plane of souls is the differentiated soulstuff on the material plane side of the land of the dead)


[7/18/2024 6:46 PM] rsulfuratus
and then any plane made of soulstuff floats in the astral plane and has some kind of origin story


[7/18/2024 6:47 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not convinces the astral plane needs to exist


[7/18/2024 6:48 PM] .deciusmus
Is it too religious-vibe to have soul stuff be the Divine Presence?


[7/18/2024 6:50 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is it too religious-vibe to have the soul stuff be the Divine Presence. And also is probably inconsistent with it being shaped into outer planes by Void Mind things


[7/18/2024 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it is the Divine Presence imbuing some if its creative magic into something new


[7/18/2024 6:52 PM] rsulfuratus
also re: astral plane, I think it is useful to have a way to travel to the outer planes that isn't plane shift


[7/18/2024 6:52 PM] .deciusmus
Are elven , dwarven , and human souls different in some metaphysical way?


[7/18/2024 6:53 PM] rsulfuratus
I don't know but I'm not sure there is any reason for them to be


[7/18/2024 6:54 PM] .deciusmus
What about the idea that the divine presence basically creates the astral plane - the source of soul stuff - in imitation or learning from the plane of magic - and elves and dwarves and everyone else is created when the embodied gods pass the soul stuff from the astral plane to the plane of souls


[7/18/2024 6:55 PM] .deciusmus
Humans are the first souls that go freely in some sense which is why they have the divine spark


[7/18/2024 6:57 PM] rsulfuratus
i like that


[7/19/2024 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
pretty busy today but noodling a bit when I have time. Rewrote the summary as:

The **Age of Myth**, when the multiverse was new, a period before time itself was created. The Age of Myth begin with the first act of creation and are a time of the archfey, titans, elements, and great wyrms, a time when the power of arcane magic coursed unchecked through the multiverse and altering reality was as simple as a thought. This age ends with [[The Riving]] when the [[Divine Presence]] separates the planes of existence from each other and creates the [[Material Plane]]. This was a time of huge empires and incredible acts of magic, but also of much chaos.

The **Age of Creation** began after [[The Riving]], when the multiverse was created, and ended with the [[Creation of Humans]] and the breaking of the barriers that contained and constrained the creative force of ~soulstuff~. It was during the Age of Creation that the [[Elder Folk|oldest sentient species]] of Taelgar were created by [[Embodied Gods]], when the vast civilizations of [[elves]], [[Dwarves|dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and others spread across the world. This is the golden age of the non-human species, but also a time that lacked dynamism. Little changed or was truly new in this age, as the Firstborn of the Elder Folk encouraged sameness and uniformity.


[7/19/2024 9:34 AM] rsulfuratus
The **Age of Divinity** began with the [[Creation of Humans]], and the shattering of the walls that isolated the [[Material Plane]] and kept the creative force of ~soulstuff~ from affecting the wider multiverse. Humans, created by the [[Divine Presence]] itself on [[Hkar]], were unlike anything that had come before, for they were granted the Divine Spark, the ability of their beliefs to shape the very reality of the multiverse, creating [[Incorporeal Gods]] out of the material of creation itself. This was an age of great change, as the greatest hopes and darkest fears of humanity were manifest in ~soulstuff~. It was also an age when other, darker things were created by the machinations of the [[Void Mind]]. The Age of Divinity ended with the the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the destruction of [[Hkar]], and the diminishment of the power of the Divine Spark on the [[Material Plane]]. 

The **Age of Humanity** began with the sinking of [[Hkar]] and the reshaping of the world that accompanied the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. This age saw the rise and fall of Drankor, and the rise and fall of Cha'mutte, and much growth and change among human cultures. This age saw, for the first time, humanity growing to dominant the cultures of Taelgar, and the history of this age is dominated by the history of humanity.


[7/19/2024 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
I like it


[7/19/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a few small tweaks...still working through in 5-10 minute chunks around more pressing actual work


[7/19/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
Is it better to add feedback here or push my own tweaks?


[7/19/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
One comment:

> Throughout the long [[Age of Creation]], the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation, through which only the [[Embodied Gods]] could reach


[7/19/2024 12:58 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure it matters, but is this metaphysically true? Also, if the barrier is truely strong, does that mean there are no clerics / divine magic until humans are created?


[7/19/2024 1:00 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure the metaphysics of the barrier matter nor questions like where do souls come from.


[7/19/2024 1:13 PM] rsulfuratus
Implication is supposed to be that divine magic comes from the firstborn who can reach through. But agree probably not worth spending a ton of time on


[7/19/2024 1:15 PM] rsulfuratus
But metaphysically just supposed to set up the contrast with age of divinity when outer planes get created beyond those associated with embodied gods


[7/19/2024 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
right. might be worth clarifying the impact, i.e. (although secondarily, could the embodied gods reach through easily, i.e. unlike in the current age, could gods act more easily and directly on the world?)


Throughout the long [[Age of Creation]], the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation. Although the [[Embodied Gods]] could reach across this barrier, to grant miracles and change the Material Plane, the magic of souls could not act, except through the Embodied Gods.


[7/19/2024 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
Or something

re: multiverse, pushed this:

While there are many ways to describe the multiverse, the most widely known comes from elven scholars, who describe the multiverse a pair of intersecting domes: the below, the dome of the physical planes rising from the roiling chaos of the [[Plane of Magic]]; above, the dome of the planes of sentience, descending from the blinding intensity of the [[Plane of Creation]].  

The duality of the [[Material Plane]] -- the physical structures of the universe -- and the [[Plane of Souls]] -- the soul structures of the sentient inhabitants of the universe -- sit in the middle of these domes, the Material Plane anchored to the dome of physicality, the Plane of Souls anchored to the dome of sentience. 

Descending "below" the material plane in this cosmology is the [[Ethereal Plane]], which stretches from the border ethereal, co-localizing with the material plane, through the interior ethereal, a foggy expanse of swirling mists, to the deep ethereal, which bleeds into the [[Plane of Magic]]. Embedded within the "sea" of the [[Ethereal Plane]] are the [[Energy Realms]], chief among them the [[Elemental Planes]], domains of pure physicality, capturing the essence of the fundamental elements of the universe.


[7/19/2024 6:39 PM] rsulfuratus
Floating "above" the plane of souls in this cosmology is the [[Astral Plane]], which is bisected by the [[Land of the Dead]], a collecting point for souls and an not-quite-impermeable barrier separating the raw energy of creation from the [[Material Plane]]. Beyond the [[Land of the Dead]], the [[Astral Plane]] is a strange empty expanse of silvery waves, in which the [[Spiritual Realms]] float like bubbles, until it merges with the blinding energy of the [[Plane of Creation]]. 

Layered on top of this cosmology, the elven scholars speak of the [[Echo Realms]], the distortions and reflections and reverberations of the planes created by [[The Riving]], which still resonance today. Most notably, these include the [[Feywild]], an echo of the material plane, and the [[Dreamworld]], an echo of the plane of souls, but others have been described, including the domains of the [[Shadowfell]], the [[Nightmare Realm]], and the [[Mirror Realm]].


[7/19/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
I like that. I was playing around with using Shadowfells (plural) rather than Shadowfell, as a way to express the idea of different independent domains better


[7/25/2024 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed a rewrite of the history of taelgar (to history-rewrite) branch that restructures age of divinity into four eras:
- growth of humanity from ~1500-2200, when not much happens, basically pre-history
- contact with elder folk from ~2200-2500, when arcane magic + idea of incorporeal gods triggers massive social and cultural change on hkar
- migrations and emigration, from ~2500-3500, starting with the northerner departures and ending with the marniner departures, with at least one (the southerener) migration in between, but possibly more
- arcane hegemony, from ~3500-4122, when the arcane urban culture gets very powerful, mos numena develops, etc; ends with downfall


[7/25/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
logic is basically that contact with elder folk / introduction of arcane magic breaks a long period of status and the social change associated triggers people to start leaving. northerners would be the last of the "small gods" people, after they depart hkar is all pantheonic. mariners are potentially the last (major) non-mos-numena culture, after they leave mos numena gets increaasingly strong and other religious communities (e.g., dunmari?) get increasingly isolated, tend to leave


[7/25/2024 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
the dates are not precise in the doc I pushed and could be shifted


[7/26/2024 9:12 AM] rsulfuratus
working a bit on filling in multiverse / cosmology detail from the riving, and wondering about your feelings about the connection between metaphysics and mechanics. 

for example, at the moment based on the way magic is set up in world, there isn't an obvious way to play a fey cleric. unless you have an unusual backstory where you came to worship a "foreign god"

not sure how i feel about that? 

it particularly impacts the children of the divine, although also potentially also impacts the "unusual species" 

more generally, the basic logic of "divine magic is miracles granted by a god" poses a bit of a challenge for societies that don't seem to innately have gods (centaurs, merfolk, fey, etc) - do they also not have divine magic? and if they don't have divine magic is that a mechanical thing or can they have "clerics" just who generate the same effects from non-divine magic?


[7/26/2024 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
I like the idea of divine magic = miracles granted by a god and in general feel like it’s better to not get too focused on D&D mechanics


[7/26/2024 10:07 AM] .deciusmus
But I do think there is a bit of a gap around non-arcane / non-divine magic


[7/26/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
That is, clearly on Taelgar there is:
Arcane casters who channel the plane of magic somehow
Divine casters who specifically get miracles from their gods
“Other casters” = lots of other magical things that are currently somewhat ill defined in the metaphysics


[7/26/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
I think that “other” category is where things like fey clerics and merfolk clerics would fall


[7/26/2024 10:16 AM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm thinking more about two distinct gaps. 

1) Do we care about matching mechanics to lore? That is, cleric/paladin spells in D&D have a certain flavor that is distinct from especially wizard spells. In some cases we've adopted D&D mechanics into lore (e.g., resurrection magic), in other cases not. Is there a reason to think that there are certain kinds of magical effects that are far more straightforward to create by divine magic than other ways? In some sense I think this is already in the lore to a certain extent, e.g. divine miracles tend to be around healing, things like that, but people don't go to a hedge wizard for healing and "Chardonian arcane magical energy" is not really focused around healing, it is things like controlling the wind, minor cantrips for cleaning and light, that kind of thing. Putting aside PC mechanics, is it therefore good or bad to have this play a significant role in worldbuilding, that is should, e.g., fey culture lean heavily away from healing, bless, that type of thing which is coded as "divine magic"? 

(2) Separately, it sometimes feels as if there is something of a gap in the divine order. Is it really the case that *every* society that is not either human or one of the elder folk (including orcs) just doesn't worship gods at all? maybe yes, but I'm not sure I agree


[7/26/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
Re: other magic, I guess I haven't really seen this as a gap? Magic is just applying extraplanar energy to defy typical physics so the source of that extraplanar energy can come from anywhere. 

Fey magic is just manipulating the resonances of the Riving to alter material plane physics using "fey logic". 

Many druids might use resonances of the Elemental Planes, others might use the natural echos of the Riving in the Material Plane itself.


[7/26/2024 10:23 AM] .deciusmus
(More in a bit)


[7/26/2024 10:44 AM] .deciusmus
A few quick thoughts...

(a) I do think that the general "tone" of divine vs arcane magic works, but also I think it doesn't have to be extremely precise or pre-decided. Fey for example seem like they'd lean heavily into enchantments and illusions but I wouldn't worry too much if that crosses the "cleric" vibe boundary (i.e. bless feels like a fey spell, maybe with a different gloss, but healing maybe less so in general). And I think it is good that Chardonian hedge wizards don't know healing spells.

(b) I actually like that gods are a specific thing, not just this idea that every culture has to have a god. I'm not sure that means that no cultures can worship anything at all... isn't the idea of the "arch fey/great wrym/elder elemental/titan"  vibe to set up this alternative power structure that can provide god-like creatures in cultures were it makes sense?


[7/26/2024 10:45 AM] .deciusmus
It may be interesting to explore, what, if anything, is the metaphyiscal difference between the children of the divine vs embodied gods vs children of belief


[7/26/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
I think the part I'm uncertain about is what is, exactly, an archfey? or a great wyrm?


[7/26/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
the lore developing around the early days / mythic history strongly focuses on humanity as the creative force behind "outer planes", with some impact of embodied gods


[7/26/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
but if the "outer planes" are strongly tied to elder folk + humans, where are all the titans of old?


[7/26/2024 10:52 AM] .deciusmus
So one direction is to play into the idea of the "plane of creation / soul stuff" as something that the children of the divine lack access to. The titans are somewhere else, not an outer realm, but somewhere associated with the "lower planes" in your cosmology


[7/26/2024 10:53 AM] .deciusmus
The other direction, I think, is to say that's wrong, and all the children of the divine presence are sorta similar


[7/26/2024 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
right, I think this is the fundamental vibe check I'm looking for


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] .deciusmus
and so titans and great wyrms and archfey are really not metaphyically different from embodied gods or human gods


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
metaphyiscally, is there something really very different about the first creations of the divine presence (elder elementals, titans, etc) and the second creations of the divine presence (embodied gods)


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
right exactly


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure the answer


[7/26/2024 10:54 AM] rsulfuratus
the details, I think, don't matter too much, but the vibe makes a big difference. especially on fey lore


[7/26/2024 10:55 AM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 10:55 AM] rsulfuratus
and kiya's questions about ultimately what is different between fey magic and wyrdling magic


[7/26/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
What happens when a fey dies is an interesting question


[7/26/2024 10:56 AM] .deciusmus
I actually think it is easier to work out the vibes via thinking about whether there is something different about fey / giants / centaurs / merfolk / etc vs elves / dwarves / orcs / humans


[7/26/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
Which I am torn on... on the one hand, one of the things I like about the metaphysics is this idea of the "firstborn" vs "humans" and the metaphysical differences


[7/26/2024 10:57 AM] .deciusmus
On the other hand, I don't love priviledging one group of species as "real people with souls" and therefore implying centaurs / fey etc don't have souls in the same way


[7/26/2024 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
but if centaurs or merfolk are the same as elves, what makes the "elder races" special and distinct?


[7/26/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
from one perspective, it is just because they were created in the age of creation, there is nothing else really distinct about them. just a question of timing, really


[7/26/2024 11:00 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure I agree / like that, but it is a possibility


[7/26/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
the firstborn are also the first entities that are called gods at least, and basically invent the concept of "deity"


[7/26/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe the root cause of Cha'mutte's war is that he was angry the so-called Firstborn claimed all the credit for their fancy ideas about "divinity" when really the true children of the divine were there are along. recast it as like a divine sibling war from greek myth


[7/26/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
on a mechanical level, I don't think it works for fey, etc to be "soulless", fwiw. putting aside any lore reasons, we also have for example the canonical fact of agata's soul hiding out in Seeker's ring


[7/26/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
Right, agreed


[7/26/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
Getting in car to drive Z but I’ll ponder more


[7/26/2024 1:11 PM] .deciusmus
So, a few thoughts while I eat lunch...


[7/26/2024 1:14 PM] .deciusmus
a) I think as first principles we should lean towards sticking with the basic idea around "firstborn (+orcs)" vs "humans" vs "hobgoblins" and that, atlhough it doesn't have to be canon that the firstborn are special and different, we should try to make that work before changing it. 

b) I think we are agreed that there is a wide variety of sentient creatures on Taelgar that are neither humans/hobgoblins/firstborn/orcs, but that nevertheless have a soul (in the sense of a essence that is distinct from the material body and that can be ressurected, banished, stolen, trapped, etc


[7/26/2024 1:17 PM] .deciusmus
c) From a vibes perspective, I think there are clear divisions within the sentient creatures between "species" and "magical entities". WIthout necessarily getting into a sidetrack about where do babies come from and so on, there is definitely a different vibe around say fey - who are all a "type" but where hags don't so obviously start life as baby hags vs say dwarves, elves, or kenku, who all clearly have some type of species continuity


[7/26/2024 1:28 PM] rsulfuratus
So, just throwing out some thoughts. Part my impetus for thinking about this is the idea of the “barrier of the land of the dead”, which sets up a very strong metaphysical distinction between eg demons (who cannot be killed on an “inner plane”, merely banished), and “creatures of the ~inner planes~


[7/26/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
But then you get the problem of what all these other species are?


[7/26/2024 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
And I guess I lean towards they all basically work the same way at a fundamental metaphysical level


[7/26/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
Which isn’t to say the “elder folk” isn’t a meaningful category


[7/26/2024 1:30 PM] rsulfuratus
But, on the other hand, the centaurs are the star of their own story too


[7/26/2024 1:32 PM] rsulfuratus
Which I think is consitdtent with your point (b)


[7/26/2024 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
One stab at a synthesis...

In the Age of Myth, all was changeable, and the flexibility of raw magical energy meant that although an infinite number of things could be created, at the same time nothing was "real". Only the children of the divine, not their creations, had permenance/self/soul, for they had been given soul-stuff by the Divine. These direct children of the divine are rare and powerful, basically they are the same as the embodied gods metaphysically. 

In the moment of the RIving, however, with the creation of the Astral Plane and the the Plane of Creation, the echoes and reverberations allowed this soul stuff to be "caught" by some of the echoes and creations of the Children of the Divine, giving them permeance and self, and power, in some sense proportional to the luck/skill/whatever that allowed one fey bundle of magic to catch much more of the essence of creation than another


[7/26/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
... I'm not totally sure where I am going with this


[7/26/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
But I guess the thought was to set up a distinction between

(a) fey and elementals, in particular, who are more creations of the echo realms, in some way, than creations of any particular god
(b) set up fey in particular as having a gradient of power. Some arch fey are much more powerful than others, and I wonder if any of the original, god-like children of the divine archfey really still exist?


[7/26/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is fine as far as it goes


[7/26/2024 1:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I’m more thinking about though, from a basic “soul” point of view, what’s the line? 

In current lore, you have humans/elder folk with clear metaphysics, and everything else very vague. 

I’m leaning toward something that is more: any sentient, self-aware being on Taelgar is, in some way, partially made of ~soul stuff~


[7/26/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
The details can be blurry and variable for different species, of course


[7/26/2024 1:43 PM] rsulfuratus
The one plausible exception might Far Realm aberrations


[7/26/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
I also think there is potentially a reasonable way to make a metaphysical distinction between some different types of creatures, specifically:

(a) the echo/inner realm inhabitants - in particular fey and elementals, but maybe some others as well, who clearly have souls but also, I am pretty sure, don't have "creator gods" and also have (I think) wide variants in power between different ones of the same "type"

(b) the demons/devils/angels/etc - outer plane inhabitants - who are, in some sense, "native soul stuff", and are much more directly tied to the energy of creation and the barrier of the land of the dead and so on

(c) far realms creatures, who I think definitely don't have Taelgarian souls at all, and are odd and unique and come from "elsewhere"

(d) the elder folk (+ orcs), whose soul stuff was distinctly, uniquely, and specifically shaped by their firstborn (+ maybe the kenku, pending Aerin's specifics)

(e) humans, whose soul stuff is explicitly shaped/given by the Divine Presence and has the Divine Spark

(f) the unique creatures: centaurs merfolk kobolds giants at least, maybe others. But what distinguishes unique creatures from elder folk + humans is that, for whatever reason, their soul stuff did not come from a god or other specific "divine" entity


[7/26/2024 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
What really distinguishes (d) from (f) is not metaphysics but origin. The creaturs in (d) are a unique category because they have gods who shape their soul stuff into their species. The creatures in (f) do not have gods, or at least, if they worship something, it isn't their creator


[7/26/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
Right, I think all makes sense. Although for example merfolk might very workshop the sentient ocean, who is their creature but not a god (in the sense of being a being of “creative energy”)


[7/26/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
*worship


[7/26/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
So metaphysically, devils are functionally gods, just very weak ones


[7/26/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
As being of “pure soul stuff”


[7/26/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
Right in the case of the merfolk the metaphysics are probably very different than say dwarves. The sentient ocean as a Far Realm being has no access to "taelgar soul stuff" in the way an embodied god would, and whatever magic was used to create/awaken/etc the merfolk they got their souls in some different way than being given them by the sentient ocean


[7/26/2024 1:51 PM] .deciusmus
Yes. Although the same is true of ghosts and dead humans, right?


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Hmm. I’m not sure why the sentient ocean couldn’t have access to ~soul stuff~. I think what I’m arguing for is thinking of -soul stuff- as essentially another force like magic


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] rsulfuratus
But obviously a lot harder to use


[7/26/2024 1:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess being made of soul stuff and being able to access it for magic are two different things


[7/26/2024 2:00 PM] rsulfuratus
so, to summarize, I think the logic is:

(1) major divisions of living or sort-of-living things in Taelgar:

(a) Sentient, self-aware creatures that are native to the "inner realms" (echo realms + energy realms + anything else that might be invented that is "protected" from the raw power of the Plane of Creation by the Land of the Dead), are sentient and self-aware because they are animated by a fragment of ~soulstuff~. When they die, this fragment typically travels to the Land of the Dead, and eventually passes beyond into the "Outer Realms". 

(b) Sentient, self-aware creatures native to the "outer realms" (spiritual realms + astral plane + anything on the "Plane of Creation" side of the Land of the Dead) are pure beings of soulstuff, manifest into physical form. When killed in the "inner realms", they return to their native plane, possibly changed. They can only be fully destroyed when beyond the Land of the Dead. 

(c) Some creatures (many constructs, some undead, simlacrums, perhaps some elementals, etc) are sentient and self-aware but only by using the raw energy of the Plane of Magic in imitation of "soulstuff". These creatures simply cease to exist if destroyed, wherever they are.


[7/26/2024 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(d) Creatures from the Far Realms, where different rules apply.


[7/26/2024 2:01 PM] rsulfuratus
(e) Beasts or other kinds of non-self-aware, non-sentient creatures are just creatures


[7/26/2024 2:03 PM] rsulfuratus
Then, most of the "interesting" distinctions are within (a), and this has a lot to do with origin stories and how each individual species / creature gained access to "soulstuff".


[7/26/2024 2:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 2:05 PM] .deciusmus
This all fits pretty well with the Creating New Species document, although I think the distinctions in (a) probably don't map well onto that document


[7/26/2024 2:11 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the big vibe shift is kind of opening things up to diverse ways that various non-divine entities might have had access to "soul stuff magic" to create things


[7/26/2024 2:11 PM] .deciusmus
I would also add that I think it is worth establishing that within (a) there is basically 3 categories:

(a) humans, who were given Divine-Spark-enabled soul stuff directly from the Divine Presence
(b) the "created" races (elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk, stoneborn, orcs, and maybe kenku) who are distinguished via the story of a creator god who specifically shaped them
(c) other (everyone else) whose only real distinguishing trait should be that they are not (b)


[7/26/2024 2:12 PM] .deciusmus
I guess I'm not sure how that plays out exactly, but I still think it is important to preserve something unique about the "firstborn" races


[7/26/2024 2:13 PM] .deciusmus
That is, I guess I mean, I still think it is worth thinking about how (b) is different from (c) in a way that provides a canonical reason why centaurs and merfolk were not targeted by Cha'mutte


[7/26/2024 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
I would say that the clear metaphyiscal uniqueness there is actually in the nature of the embodied gods


[7/26/2024 2:14 PM] rsulfuratus
that is, you have say four (currently) types of beings that are "made of soulstuff"


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
(a) the children of the divine
(b) the embodied gods
(c) the incorporeal gods and everything related to them (which would, in this case, stretch to natives of "outer planes")
(d) the divine presence themselves


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] rsulfuratus
the unique think about the firstborn is they are the only sentient species created by (b)


[7/26/2024 2:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right so the idea would be that actually you have a distinction like

(a) humans, created by Divine Presence
(b) firstborn, created by the Embodied Gods, who are a specific group with unique commonalities 
(c) others, created by something or someone else, who is definitely not an Embodied God, because the embodied gods are specific group of entities


[7/26/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
exactly


[7/26/2024 2:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I actually think this implies perhaps a bit of revision of the void mind and the three despairs, to make Thark unique as the only embodied god among the Void Mind creations

{Reactions}
👍

[7/26/2024 2:17 PM] rsulfuratus
which is in practice how things have played out in game, with Thark clearly distinct from e.g. Jinnik


[7/26/2024 2:17 PM] .deciusmus
It also suggests that the earlier statement - that there is nothing special about the embodied gods - is probably wrong


[7/26/2024 2:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there is nothing special in the sense that they, like the children of the divine and the incorporeal gods, are "powerful beings made of the energy of creation"

but, metaphysically, there is something unique about the way they are created that is distinct from the way the children of the divine or the incorporeal gods are created


[7/26/2024 2:21 PM] rsulfuratus
the original idea is that they are physically embodied in a way the incorporeal gods are not, and so are not tied to belief in the same way. so there are differences


[7/26/2024 2:22 PM] .deciusmus
Radical thought: should titans elder elementals arch fey great worms actually still exist?


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
what, like Cha'mutte was the last of his kind?


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] .deciusmus
What if, for the most part, they were somehow consumed/destroyed/turned into echos during the Riving


[7/26/2024 2:23 PM] rsulfuratus
although that raises questions. like, what is Gazankoa if not an elder elemental?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
or the various archfey?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] rsulfuratus
or, i guess, maybe the point is there were once *even more powerful* versions of these that disappeared?


[7/26/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that was the idea


[7/26/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
The archfey are just really powerful fey now. None of the existing arch fey were actually alive in any meaningful sense before the riving


[7/26/2024 2:26 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure that is an important detail to decide on at the moment, but worth keeping in mind


[7/26/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
I guess its more a vibe-thing: I don't think we should necessarily think of Ethlenn and Gazankoa and Cha'mutte as necessarily "siblings" or "part of the same creation"


[7/26/2024 2:28 PM] .deciusmus
or even "the same type of thing" in the way that Elmerca and the Bahazeal are "the same type of thing"


[7/26/2024 2:29 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, from a vibes perspective I think that makes sense, but also there could have been a lot of diversity pre-Riving. and how would you even remember stuff if linear casuality doesn't work? it is possible that entities that survived the riving emerged deeply changed


[7/26/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[7/26/2024 2:30 PM] rsulfuratus

I left a few notes about the species stuff... but go ahead and merge I liked all the timeline stuff


[7/26/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm slightly editing the species doc. my intention is not to suggest there are lots of additional species that are associated with dragons/fey/elementals/giants, but rather that giants, dragons (+kobolds), fey (many different species), and elementals (many different species) are their own thing separate from the more general "awakened/cursed/other" category


[7/26/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
are they necessarily though?


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
in practice I don't think it matters


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe not really


[7/26/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm questioning whether, i.e. Titans should necessarily be considered canonical


[7/26/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
or whether it means anything to say "Dragons were [something] by great wyrms"


[7/26/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
I think that is maybe under considered and if we ever decided to make up the history of dragons and what they are precisely, the existence or not of great wryrms in the age of myth isn't super relevant


[7/26/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
same deal with giants; whether titans are a real thing or not I'm not sure it is meaning to say that giants are in some sense an "echo" of titans.


[7/26/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
This is more relevant to me in terms of the fey where I'm not at all convinced that the story is "archfey created fey" but maybe something more like "some type of essence that has been conceptualized as fey by the current fey existed before time and its transformation during the Riving created many different fey creatures, of widely varying power levels"


[7/26/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i am fairly attached to the idea that giants and dragons are somehow larger than life and have this history of being vastly more powerful, with echoes of that power (e.g., phasing stones, flying castles) lingering


[7/26/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the fey and elementals are distinct and in some ways more complicated and so perhaps not too helpful to lump all four groups together


[7/26/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Again, not sure it matters in the species doc; I'm really just arguing that sentient species - including fey/giants/elementals - should have some kind of unique creation story and/or a canonically blank space filled only with vibes


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'd rather say:

Giants and dragons are, in some sense, echoes or descendants or creations of the beings of pure magical energy that existed before the Riving


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
and than describe your vibe thing above


[7/26/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[7/26/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
I actually think it solves some problems to just say the time before the Riving was in some sense unknowable and is vibes based only and be judicious about which existing structures on Taelgar echo back to a pre-Riving time.

Clearly giants, dragons, fey, and elementals do (although for different reasons) but I'm not sure it would be a problem if a fifth category came along that should also echo back to ancient days. But that doesn't necessarily imply the existing of some specific set of entities created by the Divine Presence


[7/26/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking about what is actually in game and not world building, I think:
- the vibe I described about giants and dragons is important, and also for giants some kind of history/echo of much stronger magic in the past that is connected to rune magic and the dwarven firstborn and such (leading to myths -- maybe true, maybe not -- that the Runecrafter learned magic from ~someone/something~ during the Riving)
- the fey are diverse and despite having different forms and power have a shared history, so it doesn't necessarily make sense to have a separate "origin story" for satyrs vs pixies, for example. the fey, writ large, have a kind of collective origin of some kind, dating to the riving
- elementals are similar, albeit someone more hierarchical and ordered, and much more commonly soullles magical creations (most standard "water elementals" or whatever are this) than fey are, and they are orgainzed around rulers of each domain (e.g., marid, djinni, efreeti, dao), who in tern owe allegiance to some kind of "elemental powers" of which gazankoa is the only named example


[7/26/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but yes that dynamic (unknowable, vibes based) probably makes sense


[7/26/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
for pre-riving "history"


[7/26/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I agree about all of that, but I actually think it is more important to, i.e. state that the fey, as a "type of creature" have a shared origin that dates to the Riving than to try to say that "archfey" existing before the riving and fey are somehow related.

and I also think that "echoes of the Riving" is a potentially more flexible category than just fey/elementals/dragons/giants but also doesn't necessarily include say kobolds and trolls even though kobolds are dragon-ish and trolls are giant-ish


[7/26/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
so, I think I might modify the inner plane native to separate out "echoes of the riving" (fey, elementals, dragons, giants at the moment), from "other" and then merge "corrupted, awakened, unusual" into "other" which is just everything else


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that makes sense to me


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
although actually corrupted I thought was a decent category on its own


[7/26/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, right, good to keep that as well


[7/26/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
Mentally, it feels to me like the areas I'd be comfortable just randomly introducing something in game without some kind of pre-dicsussion (YMMV might be reasonably different than mine) would be 
(a) corrupted
(b) types of fey or elementals
(c) beasts
(d) magical creations
(e) children of creation
(f) abberations

But things that didn't fit in those categories I'd probably want a better story and compelling reason


[7/26/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
Which is were in particular, I find the species guide useful. To define the types of things that are "common" vs "rare", in some sense


[7/26/2024 6:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that is reasonable. i pushed an update that I think is clearer. will slightly tweak age of myth text, and then merge, later tonight

[7/26/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
also might add explicit comments about "easy to add things" and "think about it" and "probably don't" to the now 10 categories


[7/26/2024 6:36 PM] rsulfuratus
but having dinner now


[7/26/2024 7:48 PM] rsulfuratus
merged


[8/4/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
any thoughts about true names and the magic of names esp amongst the fey in taelgar?


[8/4/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
Not really a thing? Myth/culture but not very powerful? Some type of actual magic?


[8/12/2024 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i added images for the rest of Delwath's items, curious what you think/if there are any that don't work for you


[8/12/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
also not sure how I missed the question about true names / magic of names. don't really have thoughts other than kind of wanting to avoid layering too many things together. might make sense for dragons and/or fey? certainly seems kind of fey-ish to have names mean something...but no real strong feelings any way at the moment


[8/12/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
I like the Delwath items. The rod of the pact keeper is creepy but that seems reasonable given its origin


[8/12/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
On names, here is what I ended up telling my players...

That said, to expand on the "aliases and names thing"....

The actual biggest danger is not even the "alias/call me by" that Kiya is talking about, it is the innocent  but misleading question, i.e.

"Can I have your name?"

A trickster fey could certainly have magic about them that would mean answering that question with "Sure, my name is Robin" could be bad. Now the fey "has" your name - maybe that makes it easy for them to impersonate you - maybe it means all of a sudden you forget your name - etc.

But the trouble was not catching the precise wording.

Answering a question with "Call me by..." rather than "my name is" is a safety measure - if someone says

"Can I have your name" and you answer "Call me Robin" you haven't given away your name.
Secondarily, the point Kiya was making is also true. There is a degree to which certain curses, rituals, etc depend on knowledge about the person, and certainty is better than doubt.


[8/12/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
So announcing to a fey "I am Robin of Abenfyrd, born in 1699, member of the order of the chartiable wanderer, acting guard captain of Cleenseau" gives them more true things about you. Which can make certain types of magic easier.

Saying instead: "Call me Robin, lately from Abenfyrd, wanderer and defender of the lands north of the Enst" is a lot vaguer, and thus less powerful.

But also a lot of Sembarans would call some of this Tyrwinghan superstitution. The true nature of fey magic is mysterious and exactly what powers it none of you know

To add, as far as you know there is no "true name" magic. That is, it isn't like if someone knows your name is Robin or Celyn or whatever, they have a voodoo-doll power over you and somehow you have to hide your name. 

It is better to think of it as more along the lines of - the less well your fey adversary knows you, and the more obstacles or secondary interpretations you put in your words, the better.


[8/12/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
[ in my head, I was basically thinking I didn't want to introduce yet another type of magic, although if dragons or something ends up having the concept, fine, there is a lot of "as far as you knows" in the above. But I think fey have enough going on without introducing the idea of True Names or whatever. And that the vibe of "hiding who you are" is better than something about the specific name ]


[8/12/2024 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah this all makes sense to me from a fey angle. possibly dragons have some secret "magic language" where names matter more or something (a callback to 'true magic' from high school) but that is for later and I agree the fey vibe is more about knowledge of who you are then any specific words


[8/15/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
Do you know what happened to Cloudspinner and are keeping it secret for game/plot reasons or do you just not know?


[8/15/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
I'm potentially setting up my PCs to care a bit about her fate. Not that it will come up soon or anything but they might at some point want to do something like go haring off to try to save her.

(Given that I'm setting up Greymalkin as a refugee from Amberglow, and that they are all the kind of people who hear the words "good fey mysteriously imprisoned" and immediately think  "um, maybe we should free her")

I guess canonically they can't possibly free her because she isn't free in 1748.


[8/15/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes I know exactly what happened to her and can't tell you (yet)


[8/15/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
But you will almost certainly have more information before it becomes relevant in your game


[8/15/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Note that probably all Greymalkin would know is that Cloudspinner mysteriously vanished


[8/15/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the only way you learned she was imprisoned was the meta-narrative in the intro to the Amberglow / Caulaus session


[8/15/2024 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
right, that makes sense


[8/15/2024 6:15 PM] .deciusmus
how's this

"Seven hundred years ago, to the south, the Cloudspinner, Queen of Sunsets ruled the fey realm of Amberglow. How I wish I had seen it in those days. It is said to have been a land where the glorious colors of the evening sun turned the sky and the grass and the water and the rocks to ever-changing paintings." He stops and shrugs in a way that points at his bright coloring. "It was a place aflame with color and joy, I am told."

"But she vanished - to where, no one knows - and the land decayed. The colors seeped out of it, and darkness and danger moved in. But not all was lost, for in pockets and hidden crannies, those loyal to the Cloudspinner kept hope alive. I was born in one of those pockets, ~name tbd~, in the days before the Great War, about 200 years ago."


[8/15/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
haven't written more yet but the basic narrative is that about 100 years ago, this pocket of safety fell to Umbraeth


[8/15/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's about right, timing might be slightly off, the exact date of cloudspinners disapperance is sometime after 950 - when the orcs of the people of the rainbow started to leave amberglow and before 1059 - fall of drankor


[8/15/2024 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a random bit that I just made up without context about the resistance to the decay in the cloudspinner page you can steal from if you want


[8/15/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I was looking at that


[8/15/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
I guess “more than seven hundred years” is a better opening


[9/1/2024 3:14 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure if you are still on Nantucket with your friends, but FWIW Nathaniel has been asking for a while to start a new family D&D campaign which we are finally doing soon, and I'm reviving Addermarch as the setting. Will probably be pushing some significant cleanup / updates over the next couple of days. when you have free time might be useful to chat a bit about relationships between Addermarch and Tyrwingha but no rush


[9/1/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
Still on Nantucket but happy to text about addermarch a bit. Only have my phone but…


[9/1/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
I have a few people from addermarch but haven’t developed it much. Figured it was somewhat more influenced by Tyrwingha than other places and the Darkwood is connected to Duskmire in some way


[9/1/2024 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
basically trying to work out a rough history. my recollection from the Duskmire history is that the Darkwood goes way back. there is a note suggesting that Umbraeth was exiled in the DR 600s, but not sure if that is strictly canonical


[9/1/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
but assuming that Darkwood is a dangerous place during the Drankorian expansion (timing is not perfect, but relatively close), Addermarch is probably a pretty marginal backwater during the Drankorian era


[9/1/2024 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm imagining the geography/climate as kind of mid-Atlantic Applachians. Addermarch itself is pretty hilly with difficult overland travel, except along the (few) navigable rivers / river valleys


[9/1/2024 5:35 PM] rsulfuratus
so my basic history is that:
- pre-Drankor, Addermarch is settled by Tyrwinghans, but is always fairly marginal
- Drankor, it is a province of Drankor, but not a particularly important one. but crucially outside the deal with Ethlenn so more directly assimilated


[9/1/2024 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
have some forestry, and the Aure is navigable as far as Addermarch, so not a total economic dead zone. but not rich by any means.


[9/1/2024 5:39 PM] rsulfuratus
in the Timeline of Sembaran history, Addermarch is noted to be established as the Earldom of Adderfell (presumably being called an Earldom due to cultural and historical connections to Tyrwingha) in lands formerly controlled by Avatus


[9/1/2024 5:42 PM] rsulfuratus
here it seems like there are two possibilities, based on the geography that has Addermarch as kind of a pocket surrounded by hills on three sides (west, south, east):
- one option would be that this was an area that suffered from hobgoblin and other raids for a long time after the major defeats of Avataus, basically a backwater where many of the hobgoblins, etc, in Avatus army fled
- a different option would be actually this was never conquered, but was cut of from Sembara by Avatus, and so during the post plague years it was really functionally a part of Tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
in either case, it becomes part of the Sembaran crown during Derik I's rule, after the defeat of Avatus


[9/1/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not convinced that Atavus stuff has to be canonical


[9/1/2024 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
I’ve imagined the western and northern borders of addermarch to be pretty rough terrain


[9/1/2024 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
So it seems plausible it was never conquered and has an older history


[9/1/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, basic idea is that the western edge of the mostreve hills is a very rough, with a steep escarpment particularly on the west that borders the Gap of Maseau


[9/1/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
less rough to the northeast where the Aure flows towards the Enst, of course, and less rough towards Tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
The Tyrwinghan part of the mostreve hills I’ve established as much denser in fey than elsewhere and not very settled but where settled very traditional


[9/1/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense


[9/1/2024 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
potentially Ethlenn's domain might extend southeast towards Orenlas, putting the Tyrwinghan Mostreve hills at the center


[9/1/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah maybe


[9/1/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think the settlement of addermarch was probably originally a bit complex - tyrwinghans but also clearly leaving Ethelenns domain


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right. it has many cultural similarities to Tyrwingha but doesn't have the same fey connection which has a big impact


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
potentially in part settled by Tyrwinghans who *didn't* want to be part of Ethlenn's bargain


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
It might have originally been something of a frontier perhaps even a place of exile / banishment from Tyrwingha. Somewhat dangerous and with fey in the Darkwood on the southern border


[9/1/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
Right the rejection of the bargain could work as well


[9/1/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
post-Drankor, my image of the vibe is kind of like the Dendarii Mountains in the Miles books, although without the implication of technological backwardness and the kind of dumb hill people stereotypes


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but a rough place that was the center of guerilla fighting during several post-Drankor, pre-Great War wars (e.g., Avatus), but never conquered and proud of it


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
then, the same thing repeats during the hobgoblin wars. it is never conquered, but especially during the 3rd hobgoblin war it is completely isolated from Sembara


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I like that


[9/1/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/1/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
Honestly there isn’t really any reason it ever has to have been part of sembara


[9/1/2024 5:55 PM] .deciusmus
It might work better if it was simply always an independent frontier type place


[9/1/2024 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's true


[9/1/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
A backwater Drankorian province in the hills that was mostly known for the Darkwood in the south


[9/1/2024 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
Avatus never conquerors it but probes and maybe does some damage/marches through


[9/1/2024 5:57 PM] .deciusmus
But during the Avatus-Great War period is closely aligned with sembara and there are lots of back and forth


[9/1/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Then during the more recent hobgoblin wars it becomes more isolated again


[9/1/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I think that makes sense. it might have a similar history to e.g. Vostok, in that during the height of the power of the Deriks the earl of adderfell swears personal fealty to Derik (as an underking type thing)


[9/1/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but then post Great War it quickly departs the Sembaran orbit


[9/1/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
And in the last 150 years has developed kinda independently with a bit of a “these are our hills “ vibe


[9/1/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, especially until the final defeat of the hobgoblins in the 1650s it was repeatedly isolated from Sembara. and then even again e.g. during the undead crisis in your current campaign it would be the natural response of the people of Addermarch to retreat to the hills


[9/1/2024 6:01 PM] rsulfuratus
Adderfellians? Adderfelsh? hard to come up with a demonym


[9/1/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
Adderians ? Adderese


[9/1/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm. lots of ideas here, but not sold on anything yet. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym

Demonym
A demonym (; from Ancient Greek  δῆμος (dêmos) 'people, tribe' and  ὄνυμα (ónuma) 'name') or gentilic (from Latin  gentilis 'of a clan, or gens') is a word that identifies a group of people (inhabitants, residents, natives) in relation to a particular place. Demonyms are usually derived from the name of the place (hamlet, village, town, city, re...


[9/1/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway I think this basic history is logical, I'll probably push some updates tonight


[9/1/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
When are you setting this family game? 1740s?


[9/1/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
probaby, haven't decided


[9/1/2024 6:25 PM] rsulfuratus
thinking also about titles and governance a bit, I'm leaning towards Addermarch retaining a system similar to Tyrwingha but without the fey influence. pre-Drankor, both Tyrwingha and Addermarch centralize power largely in the hands of the earls, a group of knights-errants basically, who answer to Ethlenn in Tyrwingha but perhaps to no central authority in Addermarch, or perhaps the earls elect one of their own to be overking.

during Drankorian rule, the earls are coopted by the Drankorian state in both places with a governor ruling, but in Addermarch -- which has a much more violent post-Drankor history -- you basically revert back to earls electing an overking after Drankor falls


[9/1/2024 6:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so it has a lot of cultural parallels with Tyrwingha but more of a rugged independent vibe and without the fey influence


[9/1/2024 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
on a related topic, do you have any names for political subunits of Tyrwingha? wondering if this should be English (e.g., shires) or more French, perhaps county


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not sure there are political subunits


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
I think earls have circuits


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] .deciusmus
But not fixed domains per se


[9/1/2024 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
but there are no layers between earls and individual manors?


[9/1/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
I don’t think so. Tyrwingha is physically fairly small


[9/1/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
Celyns village, which Kiya developed in a fair bit of detail, doesn’t have a lord of any sort except the earl


[9/1/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
It was left a little unclear whether sembara introduced the idea of manorial feudalism


[9/1/2024 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right. i guess addermarch doesn't have to follow precisely but perhaps there isn't much benefit to introducing another layer


[9/1/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
Or more specifically my view was something like….

In traditional Tyrwingha there were earls who rode circuits and collected labor tithes from those on their circuits (and the earl and their household would basically live off the people and villages in their circuit)


[9/1/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
In northern Tyrwingha sembaran manorial feudalism starting to spread from sembara


[9/1/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
But I left it undeveloped how far jt had spread


[9/1/2024 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
One of the ideas is that in Tyrwingha the fey protect the people from the mysterious scary threats


[9/1/2024 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that makes sense


[9/1/2024 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
Whereas in sembara that’s the job of the manorial lord


[9/1/2024 8:57 PM] rsulfuratus
addermarch has a lot of castles and forts that need to be supported


[9/1/2024 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
So there are less taxes and formal hierarchy in Tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
Addermarch on the other hand might have formalized a group of effectively castellans beneath the earls who control the defenses


[9/1/2024 8:58 PM] rsulfuratus
but i was imagining something that wasn't directly manorial feudalism, more like you have shires or counties or whatever that have a count or a baron or whatever, and then need to support defense via castles but the castles are generally occupied by a knight or a castellan who does not have any herditary claim on the land


[9/1/2024 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe you can cut out the count/baron whatever and just have the knights/castellans as vassals of the earls


[9/1/2024 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, I’d do that. Addermarch is small. I think it’s smaller than Ireland for example


[9/1/2024 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
it is about 23,000 square miles, ireland is about 25,000


[9/1/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
It’s also a place that could be a bit random/not neat. Maybe there’s an uneven divide amongst the earls and the earl of the southern border has a couple of vassals between them and the knights


[9/1/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
Not necessarily of course but if it makes sense for a story/histody


[9/1/2024 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
But I don’t think there should be a formalized subdivision like sembaran baronies

{Reactions}
👍

[9/1/2024 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah there are also some not neat things like the lord of adderfell is considered an earl despite not riding a circuit and functioning basically like a manorial lord

Another thing to think about is the fey influence isn’t empty on addermarch - the southern part is part of the fey “belt” right? But these are duskmire fey or perhaps other domains not so safe/under control as Tyrwinghan fey.


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
So I kinda think addermarch should have more of a fey influence then say sembara … but in a more “they are dangerous” way


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
originally the idea was duskmire started in the region of the feywild colocated with darkwood


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
(and is the source of the "Darkwood" name)


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
But that’s the southern border of addermarch right?


[9/1/2024 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yup


[9/1/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
I guess addermarch itself is under less clear fey influence


[9/1/2024 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
well, it is definitely a place where people worry about the fey


[9/1/2024 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
but with almost the opposite vibes of tyrwingha


[9/1/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/1/2024 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
except probably the the far eastern part of addermarch along the tyrwinghan border, which is relatively far from the darkwood and very close to ethlenn. possibly colocated with sunset gate

As an aside - I haven’t developed the rangers a lot, but I’ve implied they are relatively active in addermarch

[9/1/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
what is your take on climate, geography, biomes, general landscape vibes of the tyrwinghan highlands?


[9/1/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. western/southern border


[9/1/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
Virgina Appalachia


[9/1/2024 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
perfect


[9/1/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
Addermarch is roughly divided into four major geographic regions:
- To the west and northwest, the Maseau Escarpment is a region of rough hills and some mountains that borders the flat plains of the Maseau Gap. This is a hard land with few people. This area was extensively fortified at multiple times in the past, but the castles in the hills have not all been maintained and many are now in ruins. %% very mountainous, steep cliffs, maybe Provence-like? white mountains %%
- The center of the realm is the Aure river valley, a land of rolling hills, forests, and many rivers that cut through the hills. This region is the most densely settled, and includes Adderfell, the only real city in Addermarch. This is also the major agricultural land in Addermarch, and the center of brandy production. The Aure is navigable from Adderfell to the Enst, and many riverboats ply their trade along it. %% Shenandoah/Blue Hills, Susquehana river valley%%
- To the south and east of the Aure valley are several lines of wooded hills and mountains, rising gradually to the height of land on the eaves of the Darkwood. This region is well-guarded, and lightly populated, mostly with smallholds of foresters and furriers. %% also mid-Atlantic Appalachians but very wooded%%
- To the east and northeast, along the borders of Tyrwingha, the poor soil of the hilly, rocky land keeps forests to sheltered valleys. This is largely rangeland: sheep and cattle graze in the high pastures in summer, and only in a few sheltered valleys do crops survive. %% more open meadows, less forests, perhaps also a bit Provence-ish? %%


[9/1/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
What about the northern hills?


[9/1/2024 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
that is part of the Maseau Escarpment


[9/1/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
I’d see the hills to the east more like the hills to the south


[9/1/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
I think the Tyrwinghan / adderfell border is thicker forested hills than what you have above?


[9/1/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I need to draw it out on a map and play a bit with it. i think I'm imagining that there are some higher mountains

[9/1/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
kind of along the part of the border that runs east/west


[9/1/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
not the border that runs north/south


[9/1/2024 9:39 PM] .deciusmus
Although maybe the forested slopes on the northern/eastern side give way to worse soil and rocky land on the west/south slopes


[9/1/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
The only thing I’ve established is that the hills to the far east are pretty forested


[9/1/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
Also that the land between the mostreve hills and the enst is rocky with steep hills and forested valleys, but hard to navigate as it rises to the Appalachian-like peaks between adderfell  and the borderlands. Basically you wouldn’t go that way if you could help it versus down the Aure


[9/1/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, this is what I'm calling the Maseau Escarpment

{Reactions}
👍

[9/1/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
basically like a big "C" with the lower curve truncated on the west end of the mostreve hills


[9/1/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
on the very western edge it is very steep and drops to a flat(ish) plain at the "Gap of Maseau" but the north is broader and probably more mountains and less dramatic cliffs rising from a plain

{Reactions}
👍

[9/1/2024 9:47 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that works


[9/1/2024 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
I had a barony of mostreve and a barony of brumecliff along the mountains in the borderlands.


[9/1/2024 9:48 PM] .deciusmus
Neither name has to be canonical


[9/1/2024 9:49 PM] .deciusmus
I was kinda figuring they were named after features of the mountains but never sorted it out in detail


[9/1/2024 9:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I am going to work on a mostreve hills page with a bit more detail on how I image the geography but open to changes

[9/2/2024 11:38 AM] rsulfuratus
do you have a pro subscription to inkarante or is the free version good enough for the maps you've made for e.g. barony of aveil?


[9/2/2024 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
Pro susbscription


[9/2/2024 11:45 AM] .deciusmus
I think the free doesnt have very many good stamps


[9/2/2024 11:46 AM] rsulfuratus
ah yeah looking at now, free is pretty minimal


[9/2/2024 12:04 PM] rsulfuratus
btw at some point I'm thinking of making a vector-based world hex map to be a slightly better organized version of the "canonical map", probably using the Adventurer Conqueror King system (smallest unit is the 6 mile hex, which aggregate to 24 mile hexes), but then I'd likely add a rough 85 x 85 mile square (1 degree latitude) and a 425 mile square. so on the large map you'd have a 20x20 grid as the biggest aggregation, with each grid cell representing 5 degrees latitude, and breaking down into 25 smaller squares, with each smaller square containing ~12 big hexes


[9/2/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
main question is what to make it in


[9/2/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
would not be designed to be player facing so doesn't have to look good


[9/2/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but ideally would be editable by both of us


[9/2/2024 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
and would be done with vectors so zoomable


[9/2/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
I read your addermarch  history which in general I quite like. The idea of the rangers originating as guerilla bands against Atavus in the 1400s is very appealing

[9/2/2024 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
Two unrelated questions:
(1) did you ever make up anything about the Mos Numena holiday of thanksgiving / salvation that marks escape from Hkar?
(2) how would elves think about war dead? would their be memorials? graves? seems like they would be treated differently than elves who leave when they want


[9/2/2024 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
Surprisngly, trying to work out answers as part of Colorado session prep


[9/2/2024 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
Never made up anything in the Mos Numena holiday.


[9/2/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
On elven war dead, I think there would be some sense of lose, like they were artificially cut off from Adanor


[9/2/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
So a memorial might celebrate that connection and therefore be living?


[9/2/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah like the idea of something living. mostly want to check that it wouldn't seem weird for their to be elven memorials to the war dead, in the same sense it would be weird to have elven graveyards.


[9/2/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
The first thought that comes to mind is something like an elaborate and enormous flowering tree. I think the vibe would very much be about memorializing the connection to Aldanor. Perhaps even something spontaneous- like the elven forest expressing its own loss of these elves who were still entangled with the mortal world


[9/2/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not sure elves would build memorials so much as tend to them


[9/2/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
One thought on addermarch - the history of 1720-1740 might be a bit hard to work out esp as it relates to Duskmire and the fey. I’m not sure if you are planning much fey involvement in the family campaign though


[9/2/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
Nathaniel wants to be a warlock with an archfey patron


[9/2/2024 4:38 PM] rsulfuratus
but i doubt that requires lots of details


[9/2/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. doesn't really matter if something dramatic happens to Umbreath in your campaign


[9/2/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
as long as like the Darkwood is not cleansed of all darkness or something


[9/2/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case i want him to be free to be silly and creative so not planning on trying to connect his fey patron to more established lore, particularly


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
Right, makes sense. There are a bunch of spaces for random minor fey lords along the sunset gate


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
That are broadly “good” and aligned with Ethlenn


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i was either going to do that, or someone from the talking animals realm


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
since I think nathaniel would like a talking animals fey patron


[9/2/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, sure.


[9/2/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
which could also be along sunset gate, just further north, so would make more sense if he wants to be from somewhere "far away"


[9/2/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah it could also be to the west a bit, north of duskmire and overlapping zimkova


[9/2/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
right, I was just looking at the old feywild map you made


[9/2/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
which we should really put in obsidian at some point


[9/2/2024 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
I thought I did in worldbuilding but maybe not

FYI I also made up with the help of maps + chatGPT about 50 village names derived from Gaelic or Old French / Norman French, sometimes with Old English mixed in, and got chat GPT to make up folk entymologies for all of them, if useful in the brainstorming section of wordlbuilding. if you use any, mark as used

[9/4/2024 10:17 AM] rsulfuratus
not sure if you are interested in this, but with the new D&D rules now available I've been thinking a bit about updating the set of playable species in Taelgar, both to bring homebrew species up to the new design and to have a bit more principled set of playable species (motivated by the new family campaign I'm starting and Isaac's friends wanting to make new Taelgar characters for the semi-defunct Great Library campaign). 

thinking a little bit about it, my feelings are that there are really potentially four groups of species.

1. standard species are species that are widespread, deeply integrated into worldbuilding, and straightforwardly available as PC options (but they don't have to be common, e.g. elves). I'd consider these to be: human, elf, dwarf, lizardfolk, halfling, stoneborn, kenku, centaur at the moment but could move other species here possibly.

2. fey species are the large class of feywild natives that often find themselves on the material plane and would usually be viable PC options. These would include: satyr, "fae/fey" (which needs a little thought as to the generic "fey humanoid" species stat block), fairy (pixie/sprite), changelings, some kind of "beastfolk" options (e.g. haregon, owlin, tabaxi type species, but requires a bit of thought)

3. "unusual" species are species with well-established lore and integrated into worldbuilding but that have complications that prevent them from being a straightforward PC option. orc, hobgoblin, goblin, bugbear, kobold, merfolk, gnome are the most obvious ones here. maybe shifter to represent lycanthropes.

4. "rare" species are things that might be viable player options but are not integrated into worldbuilding. mostly things like the various "plane-touched" humans (aasimar, tiefling, genasi), or the dhampir/hexblood/reborn Ravenloft lineages, or the "underdark" species variants. maybe warforged


[9/4/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
my main interests at the moment are:
(1) solidify the set of standard species and homebrew new versions of them
(2) solidify the set of fey species but typically use published versions for them
(3) make some decisions about what rare/unusual species would not disrupt the Taelgar vibe to include


[9/4/2024 10:19 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g., Nathaniel originally wanted to play an orc, which I decided was too complicated for the game I want to run, but in principle I could see an orc PC as being kind of an interesting option in the right campaign


[9/4/2024 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
but, again, not sure if you care too much


[9/4/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
I'm not massively interested in thinking about additional homebrew rules as my game probably has 2-3 years still to go and I have no plans to run anything small scale in Taelgar (i.e. if my game for Zachary's friends restarts, it would not be in Taelgar)


[9/4/2024 10:21 AM] .deciusmus
My main interest would be impact on worldbuilding


[9/4/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
to the extent that there is any...


[9/4/2024 10:22 AM] .deciusmus
My instinct in games I run is to wait to homebrew stuff until people want it, but I can see how that doesn't work as well for your kids/their friends


[9/4/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah it is particularly a challenge for Isaac's friends because they tend to be a lot more build-oriented than anyone else I run games for


[9/4/2024 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
so they always want to see the traits/features before they decide what to do


[9/4/2024 10:25 AM] .deciusmus
In general, I think there is a benefit to "less is more" in this space though. D&D has way too many playable species


[9/4/2024 10:25 AM] rsulfuratus
even if they just rebuild their existing characters I need dwarf, lizardfolk, (some kind of fey) for them, plus halfling, elf, human for my family game, so that is nearly all the most common options anyway (except for stoneborn which no one ever seems to want to play)


[9/4/2024 10:26 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i feel like there is a fair bit of tension between worldbuilding and what a lot of the people I run games for want here, so i'm trying to balance


[9/4/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
from a worldbuilding perspective adding more species gets to be quite annoying, so the humans + elder folk is a great setup


[9/4/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
and having diverse fey options seems like a good compromise to expand the playable species quite a bit with minimal worldbuilding impact


[9/4/2024 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
Yes, that makes a lot of sense to me


[9/4/2024 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
In particular, having a wide variety of fey species doesn't actually commit any of them to be "real species" with lore and stuff. There's no need for a defined community of taxabi to have a half-cat fey


[9/4/2024 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
right, exactly. it is the obvious solution to any kind of "beastfolk" build


[9/4/2024 10:35 AM] rsulfuratus
the big things I'm not sure about that could impact worldbuliding are:
(1) kobolds have always occupied a bit of weird place. i've used them a fair bit (mostly in the Great Library) campaign and they don't really work as a "typical evil" race (orcs, goblinoids). generally they've been regarded as a nuisance and sometimes a threat by humans nearby, but there is certainly room to expand kobold lore. adding kobolds to centaurs and kenku as "playable weird species not from the feywild" would give 9 species + fey options that feels pretty complete. 
(2) there are a large number of D&D species that are basically plane-touched humans. i don't want these to have big communities and have lots of lore, but i'm not sure whether or not it would matter to allow e.g.  one-off aasimars with unique backstories that are fundamentally "human".


[9/4/2024 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think there is a place for kobolds as an interesting "other" species (to go along with kenku, merfolk, and centaurs in particular) and a "nuisance" but not "creation of the void mind" species seems like it could fill a niche


[9/4/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
As to (2), I think sensible having some one-off stuff (which, actually, kinda fits in the lore via a "magical soul", especially for tielflings or aasimar


[9/4/2024 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
(and probably Gensasi as well)


[9/4/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
if it were me I don't think I'd let anything outside of assimar/gensai/tieflings in though


[9/4/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
for "plane touched" humans


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
Potential updated elf. Goal is to streamline a little bit (no need to repeat spell descriptions in the traits) and balance against PHB 2024 Elf. Could potentially use a couple more ritual choices, and the 5th level improvements for Elven Ritual Magic are maybe not strong/interesting enough.


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
### Elves

**Creature Type**: Humanoid
**Size**: Your size is Medium.
**Speed**: 30 feet
**Age**: Elves do not die of old age, but during each cycle of the ka, the pull of the material world weakens for them. Few elves remain on Taelgar beyond their fifth ka (approximately 800 years).
**Languages**: Elves long lifespan means they typically learn more languages than usual. You may select up to two additional languages beyond the three languages that all characters start with. Should you wish, you can exchange one or both of these language proficiencies for tool proficiencies. 

As an Elf, you have these special traits.

**Darkvision**: You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

**Keen Senses**: You have proficiency in the Insight, Perception, or Survival skill. 

**Trance**: You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep. You can finish a Long Rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.

**Resilience of the Dream:** The connection to Elmerca and Aldanor that developed during the first years of your life has left you resilient to mental and physical tolls. You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed condition, you are unaffected by mundane diseases, and you have advantage on saving throws to avoid or end magical or unusual diseases.


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
**Firstborn Gift**: You have an innate understanding of the weave of magic from your connection to Elmerca, the Wild Star, and Aldanor, the Living Tree. You choose one of the following talents.
- *Elmerca's Gift*: You know the Prestidigitation cantrip. When you finish a long rest, you can replace that cantrip with a different cantrip from the Wizard spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this gift), and for you this cantrip requires only Verbal components. 
- *Aldanor's Gift*: Your Speed increases to 35 feet, and you learn the Druidcraft cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this gift), and for you this cantrip requires only Verbal components. 
- *Gift of the Sea:* You can breathe air and water, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you learn the Shape Water cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select this gift), and for you this cantrip requires only Verbal components.


[9/4/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
**Elven Ritual Magic**. Your innate connection to the weave of magic allows you to learn one spell from among the choices below. You always have this spell prepared, and you may cast this spell as a ritual, even if it does not have the ritual tag. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the spell). *When you reach character level 3,* you learn a second ritual from this trait. *When you reach character level 5,* your skill with ritual magic intensifies. Spells you cast with this trait do not require Concentration, have their duration tripled (if it is not Instantaneous), and can be cast with only a 1 minute ritual. 
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Protection.**_ You learn the Mage Armor spell. 
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Sight.**_ You learn the Detect Magic spell. 
- _**Ritual of Elmerca's Knowledge.**_ You learn the Comprehend Languages spell. 
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Awareness.**_ You learn the Locate Animals or Plants spell. 
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Speech.**_ You learn the Speak with Animals spell. 
- _**Ritual of Aldanor's Ward.**_ You learn the Alarm spell.

PHB 2024 elves get this instead of ritual magic + firstborn gift:

In the Addermarch game, Nathaniel wants to be:
- A human noble from Sembara, from a very rich family
- The family has a secret connection to a fey cult of some kind
- The fey cult is associated with Lord Serenveil, Prince of the Vesperwind, Guardian of Twilight's Edge

Nathaniel wants the fey stuff to be kind of mysterious right now. I think probably Lord Serenveil makes the most sense as the lord of one of the border realms near the Sunset Gate, presumably in Sembara. Most likely this would be an associate of Ethlenn, but might make the fey stuff a little unclear as to motives (but can put that off for a while)

The rich Sembaran family with secret fey associations could be just something completely invented but if there is an obvious place for that would be interested in your opinion


[9/8/2024 2:09 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm. Let me think for a minute.


[9/8/2024 2:10 PM] .deciusmus
Are you thinking 1740s or 1725 or what exactly?

haven't really settled on a time yet to be honest


[9/8/2024 2:12 PM] rsulfuratus

Right.

The Asa family. Sarabeth Asa was a magic user of some kind (not defined what) who fought with Cece in the hobgoblin wars and was granted Asineau manor as a reward


[9/8/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
She disappeared into (presumably) the feywild in the 1670s, and her son went looking for her and vanished in the 1710s


[9/8/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Sarabeth’s wife could have been connected to a larger fey cult


[9/8/2024 2:30 PM] .deciusmus
Or Sarabeth could have been although the family is a bit far west


[9/8/2024 2:31 PM] .deciusmus
But I have very little made up about her, maybe the Asa family is important in the borderlands somewhere


[9/8/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
Having her connected to a fey cult would explain why Umbraeth went after her (if that is what happened haven’t actually decided why she or her son disappeared)


[9/8/2024 2:32 PM] rsulfuratus
Where is Ainseau manor?


[9/8/2024 2:32 PM] .deciusmus
Near Cleenseau


[9/8/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
But the Asa family is from Mosteve Hills


[9/8/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
Lady Sarabeth Asa. I think I've told you her story before? She was from a small village in the Mostreve Hills, near the source of the Clavert River, in the Barony of Brumecliff. When she was granted this manor, a number of refugees from her old village settled here, including my mother. We brought with us the memories of the Wyrdling, from our old village, and still remember their miracle here, each September.


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
Doesn't seem to fit the "rich family" bill very well


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
True


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
Another idea. Moreau family


[9/8/2024 2:34 PM] .deciusmus
They are the barons of fellburn


[9/8/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
Very little made up about them except there are twins- a brother and sister - the brother panicked during the undead attacks against fellburn and refused to help their father


[9/8/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
When he was trapped outside the walls


[9/8/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
The brother was then exiled and the sister made baron


[9/8/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
Natheniel could be a cousin or something who has gone south trying to find the exiled brother


[9/8/2024 2:36 PM] .deciusmus
(Or I guess he could even be the exiled brother if he wants, I had a name but it was a minor detail so doesn’t have to stick with that name)


[9/8/2024 2:38 PM] .deciusmus
(The father died)


[9/8/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
the adventure motivation is that the fey cult send Nathaniel's character to Addermarch to find out more about this mysterious alchemist in the hills, who is going to be their patron


[9/8/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is probably easier not to have a family that is tied to events in your 1720 campaign, as it anchors things too much in time and nathaniel is much more vibes based than details based


[9/8/2024 2:39 PM] .deciusmus
A third idea is the de Brune family. They are a wealthy merchant family with connections along the Enst


[9/8/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
I have two people in the Cleenseau region established but they could easily be spread along the whole Enst valley, they are established as having connections up and down the river.


[9/8/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that actually seems pretty ideal


[9/8/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
And actually the fey bad guys in my campaign are about to screw around with Sabine de Brune, the castellan of Valit, so having the family have a secret fey connection might be something id steal


[9/8/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
is eskbridge a manor? free town?


[9/8/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
Not decided


[9/8/2024 2:43 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be a good location for Nathaniel to be from, would be easy to have news of Addermarch there


[9/8/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
so thinking maybe the de Brune family has holdings there? would require they emerge from the whole lich thing well off as I'm definitely setting this game after the lich events


[9/8/2024 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
but also could be a different branch of the family in eskbridge or something


[9/8/2024 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
Having the de Brunes be a secret fey cult family based in near Eskbridge (perhaps with several small manors but not the lords of eskbridge itslf) and holdings along the Enst seems perfect


[9/8/2024 2:46 PM] .deciusmus
Eskbridge itself is a relatively small town (2000-3000) and canonically the only bridge over the Enst other than Cleenseau


[9/8/2024 2:47 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. my thinking is an entrepenurial family with holdings along the Enst in Eskbridge could also be fairly wealthy, and would have reason to care about interests upriver in Addermarch, so the fey cult sending a younger son to investigate something would be perfect


[9/8/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
And there were some undead attacks on it and in 1720 the tyrwinghans are massing on the border but it’s been relatively unscathed and is off the main plot


[9/8/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/8/2024 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
Catherine de Brune in Cleenseau has been established as one of the wealthier people in the region (Cleenseau)


[9/8/2024 2:48 PM] rsulfuratus
okay perfect. not going to develop too much of this yet until i have a better sense of how much detail Nathaniel cares about but will start from here


[9/8/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
fey patron for both Nathaniel and the family cult, is Lord Serenveil, Prince of the Vesperwind, Guardian of Twilight's Edge.

A tall, towering figure, long flowing silver hair, dark skin, dressed in robes that shift colors between deep purples, dusky blues, and silvery grays. Fiery eyes, like fading sunset.


[9/8/2024 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
no details yet exist, but the vibe is likely an ally/lieutenant of Ethlenn guarding the sunset gate


[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
Presumably even if not a direct lieutenant it would be safe to assume he might have been used as conduit between Ethlenn and my PCs? Specifically I’ve had a few hints dropped here and there that there is a fey creature in the Cleenseau region who has been occasionally dropping hints to Celyn about danger- but in a “don’t want anyone to know I’m here” kind of way


[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, sure


[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
I’m wondering if these fey are messengers/servants of Lord Serenveil being sheltered by the be Brunes

{Reactions}
👍

[9/8/2024 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
Probably just one actually


[9/8/2024 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Nathaniel likes the kind of mysterious / not clearly the "good guys" vibe so might have Serenveil be a bit more complicated than just "lieutenant of Ethlenn" but definitely he would not be allies with Umbraeth. might have his own agenda but be independently wary of Umbraeth for example


[9/8/2024 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
and of course would not be in conflict with Ethlenn


[9/8/2024 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah sure


[9/10/2024 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
started to push a bunch of addermarch stuff, fyi


[9/10/2024 8:59 AM] rsulfuratus
some stuff still in stub/draft form


[9/10/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
did you ever make any sort of map


[9/10/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a hex map that is kind of half done


[9/10/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i do intend to finish it but got kind of busy at work


[9/10/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
which river is the umber


[9/10/2024 4:10 PM] rsulfuratus
Aure - main river that runs from Darkwood north past Adderfell
~ East Aure Fork ~ - the river that joins Aure from the east, just north of Adderfell
~ Main Aure Fork ~ - the river that joins Aure from the west, a bit north of Adderfell
- Umber - the river that joins the Main Aure Fork furthest west


[9/10/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
don't have the other branch (that joins Main Aure Fork between Umber and Adderfell confluence) in notes yet


[9/10/2024 4:33 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure best way to comment, but here are a few on the Mostreve Hills:

I'm not totally sure I understand the geography.


Is your view that the four regions you have are basically what I've labeld 1/2/3/4 here:

[9/10/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/10/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
I was confused because you had "NORTH" of Latazaro swamp, took me a minute to figure out you meant south (I'm fixing)


[9/10/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
how hilly is the darkwood? is it split by the hills, or kinda more inside the "bowl"?


[9/10/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
more inside the bowl imo


[9/10/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
although also it is clearly along a watershed divide


[9/10/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think the highest ground actually runs kind of along the edge of the rivers just below 2


[9/10/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
right. maybe westcliff is more like a sideways T


[9/10/2024 4:39 PM] .deciusmus
or I guess not quite, but the land of the Darkwood itself is hilly to the west and north, less so to the south and east


[9/10/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
I think Westcliff is kind of a big C marked in brown, with the very steep sections the two parallel lines due west

[9/10/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
height of land being something like:

with 1 being the highest, then 2, then 4, and 3, then 5

[9/10/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, exactly


[9/10/2024 4:42 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe swapping 4 and 3


[9/10/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
or anyway 4 and 3 are pretty close. 5 is noticably less high than 3/4

{Reactions}
👍

[9/10/2024 4:43 PM] rsulfuratus
so you have in the "East Aure Fork" highlands a fair bit of bare, open ground and some alpine meadows, while in 5 ("Tyrwingha borderlands") you have more rolling hills largely forested at the summits


[9/10/2024 4:44 PM] rsulfuratus
(but some of this is driven by poor soil in the 3/4 area as these are not quite as tall and definitely not as steep as 1)


[9/10/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
Geographically, the Mostreve Hills are composed of five distinct ridgelines:
* The [[Westcliff]] ridge runs in a truncated north-south 'C', on the western edge of the Mostreve Hills, with the highest and steepest parts of the ridge along the western edge, bordering the [[Maseau Gap]]. The highest peaks of the Mostreve Hills are here, especially along the western escarpment. 
* The ~Unnamed Aure Headwaters Ridge~ runs mostly east-west, arising from the rolling hills of the [[Aure]] river valley some 50 miles east of the Westcliff ridge, and cutting in a south-south-easterly line towards the headwaters of the [[~Aure East Fork~]]. This ridgeline partially separates [[Addermarch]] from the [[Darkwood]]. 
* The ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~, which runs in a north-easterly line, starting north of the [[~Aure East Fork~]]
* The ~North Tyrwinghan Ridge~ which is east of the Aure, and runs in a series of lines running north-west from the Tyrwinghan ridge. These peaks are notably gentler than the other ridges, and form less of a barrier to travel.
* The ~Orlenas Ridge~, which starts south of the [[Latazaro]] swamp and runs almost due east until it grows in the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]]


[9/10/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
In between these ridgelines are several major gaps:
* The [[Aure]] river cuts between the Westcliff and Tyrwinghan ridges, in a broad and relatively fertile river valley
* The Darkwood creeps north between the Westcliff ridge and the ~Unnamed Aure Headwaters Ridge~, forming a hilly wildland on the southern borders of [[Addermarch]]
* (Something between the Aure Headwaters Ridge and the Tyrwinghan Ridge, on the map at least it looks like it should be a hilly gap, although not sure what is here)
* Between the ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~ and the ~Orlenas Ridge~ the land is hilly but there are few high ridgelines, and multiple passes cut through the Mostreve HIlls immediately northwest of [[Orenlas]].


[9/10/2024 5:49 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure if the ridges would actually be named, although historically in i.e. the applachian mts everything is (Blue Ridge, Smokies, WHite Mts, Green Mts, Berkshires, Poconos, etc)


[9/10/2024 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
A few other random thoughts... 

(a) the lower Aure is somewhat unclear. Is it unsettled (if so, why)? If not (on the map it is mostly Tyrwinghan, I guess), what is the transition between Addermarch and Tyrwingha? Is there a formal border? A geographic feature

(b) the upper "Aure East Fork" also seems a bit unclear. It is hilly and impassible? Too dangerous for settlement? Too close to elves?


[9/10/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
I think this is basically right. A few small details / additions:
- The Aure Headwaters Ridge increases in height as you move to the southeast, and the soil gets poorer, so e.g. near the Aure headwaters you have the creeping edge of the Darkwood (which I think the Addermarians would see really as something that is invading their country and needs to be cut back), but by the southeastern end (headwaters of river that heads south to plaguelands) this is dry, marginal land with bad soil and can't support much in the way of forests
- The  Tyrwingan Ridge I think runs the same way in reverse, steepest/highest/worst land on the southwest end, getting better as you move north/east towards Tyrwingha
- The "East Aure River Valley" is a gap between the Aure Headers and Tyrwingan Ridge, which is not forested except in pockets, and is generally poor soil and pastureland, but supports a lot of sheep and cows potentially


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
Re questions:
(a) there probably needs to be a border between Tyrwingha and Addermarch along the lower Aure. I don't think Addermarch extends all the way to the Enst


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
Right, agree with that, but not clear why a border. Maybe just the edge of Ethlenn's claim


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
?


[9/10/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
that is probably the most obvious answer


[9/10/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
It might also make sense to run a small river from approximately "5" on the map above to the Aure, to form a border


[9/10/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
or I guess somewhere between 4 & 5


[9/10/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
i think also this is an area where there isn't a clear sense of physical borders. before drankor anyway everyone owed allegiance to an earl but they don't have physical lines, in that a village to earl A coudl be surrounded by a vilalge to earl B in theory


[9/10/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
at some point Tyrwingha probably reshuffles things (during Drankor negotiations?) so that only Ethlenn's claim is separate from Drankor


[9/10/2024 6:00 PM] rsulfuratus
but no reason there needs to be a physical feature to define a border here


[9/10/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
Right. Maybe there is an ancient line of Drankorian/fey border stones


[9/10/2024 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that would be interesting


[9/10/2024 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda like that better than a river


[9/10/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the addermarch border to the north runs along the line of the cliffs (where there really isnt a border since no one lives on the very summits), and on the west side of the Aure the cliff line basically meets the river, anything north of that is "not Addermarch" but might be either Tyrwingha or Sembaran borderlands


[9/10/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
on the east of the Aure, the border with Tyrwingha is marked by ancient stones from Drankorian era with fey markings


[9/10/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
something like the blue lines

[9/10/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I was envisioning stones that went from the Aure to peak along ridge. Sorta where the blue line is but maybe a little bit south, i.e. just straighter east


[9/10/2024 6:09 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that works too


[9/10/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
The Tyrwinghan border, is basically then: the coast/Aure/line of markers/not defined because no one lives in the southern parts of the Tyrwinghan ridge


[9/10/2024 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
something like

[9/10/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
basically this:

where the yellow highlight is tyrwinghan border, the red x's is the fey/drankorian marker line, and the blue scribble is a height of land

[9/10/2024 6:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[9/10/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
so the "tyrwinghan" ridge region doesn't have "borders", it is just unsettled land between tyrwinghan and addermarch


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not totally clear on what the forset just south of the hills is though


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] rsulfuratus
that is plaguelands


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
ah. I didn't realize the stretched so far north


[9/10/2024 6:13 PM] .deciusmus
so is that river / lake all plaguelands, basically (west of Orenlas)?


[9/10/2024 6:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the rivers that join just north of the big southern lake delimit the kind of outer edge of the influence of Orenlas


[9/10/2024 6:15 PM] rsulfuratus
although none of this is technically canon. in the defunct Plaguelands campaign the Cinder Court (which was the main enemy) was going to be based in the forests between Orenlas and Addermarch

[9/10/2024 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
hard to read, but trying to say the far west blue circle is darkwood. the yellow line is about Orenlas? But the other 2 big blue circles.. are you saying those are plagueland? Or just "hrm bad stuff no people who knows what bad stuff"?


[9/10/2024 6:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the lower left "?" is, IMO, kinda "Darkwood++"


[9/10/2024 6:17 PM] rsulfuratus
the Darkwood in my mind has this kind of "evil fey" vibe of always trying to press in and grow into the human kingdoms


[9/10/2024 6:17 PM] .deciusmus
this doesn't have to be canon, but:

[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
but maybe twilight's grace doesn't so quite so far south and/or the taelgar/feywild mapping isn't perfect or something


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah exactly so the lower left ? is matching up perfectly with Duskmire


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] .deciusmus
I think that's clearly Darkwood/Darkwood++


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
Twilight's Grace borders though should be adjusted to not cover addermarch


[9/10/2024 6:18 PM] rsulfuratus
and match the Drankorian border stones


[9/10/2024 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/10/2024 6:19 PM] rsulfuratus
I'd move "3" down to fill it, but it also sets up Addermarch as kind of a battleground state in the feywild


[9/10/2024 6:20 PM] rsulfuratus
and 3 here - covering Fellburn and Eskbridge - is potentially the domain of Nathaniel's patron and the de Brune family secret fey


[9/10/2024 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
"3" is the "mostly Ethlenn aligned border small fey kingdoms"


[9/10/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
so fits the de Brune secret fey perfectly, although I think maybe it is a unsettled place without a clear single "master archfey domain"


[9/10/2024 6:21 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[9/10/2024 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
Still open question what is between Tyrwinghan and Orenlas


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
which relates to Addermarch in the sense of ... why havent they expanded up the Aure East Fork valley


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
what makes that southeastern border a border?


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] rsulfuratus
in my mind, the mountains are much rougher and steeper than indicated on the world map


[9/10/2024 6:22 PM] .deciusmus
right, ok


[9/10/2024 6:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I think if you look at the topography as implied by watersheds instead of the drawn hills


[9/10/2024 6:24 PM] .deciusmus
so you really have high ridges like:

[9/10/2024 6:24 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think that is more accurate

then what is the woods northeast of darkwood and west of orenlas is an open question but definitely not "human civilization"


[9/10/2024 6:25 PM] .deciusmus
I like that, lessens the need to define what is south of the hills


[9/10/2024 6:26 PM] .deciusmus
So basically, in my "five ridgelines" the big change is really that the "Aure Headwaters Ridge" runs all the way east until it connects with the Tyrwinghan Ridge


[9/10/2024 6:27 PM] .deciusmus
and probably that area - where the ridges intersect - is the highest and roughest terrain east of Westcliff

### Borders

To the west and northwest Addermarch is bordered by the [[Westcliff]], a series of sharp cliffs and dangerous terrain that separates the realm from the flat plains of the [[Duchy of Maseau]] to the west, and the [[Borderlands|Sembaran borderlands]] to the north. At the Aure, the high ridge of [[Westcliff]] is cut by the river, and on the eastern bank, the land is much lower. Here an ancient line of border stones running to [[~High Peak of Tyrwinghan Ridge~]] demarcates the border with [[Tyrwingha]]. These stones are said by some to be raised by Drankor, but they are marked with complex warnings in [[Sylvan Writing|Sylvan]], and many believe they have fey origins.

The eastern border is not marked, as the high terrain between Addermarch and Tyrwinghan is unpopulated. The gentler, forested slopes to the north and east are under the demense of Tyrwinghan earls, and the dryer, arid slopes to the south and west, the land of Addermarian earls.

To the south, Addermarch is bordered by the high ridge of the [[Mostreve Hills]], where the headwaters of the [[~Aure East Fork~]] flow, and then, to the southwest, the [[Darkwood]]. This border is carefully watched for fear of what might creep out in the shadows.


[9/10/2024 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
Great


[9/10/2024 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
did you push any of this? working on some updates


[9/10/2024 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
no, pushing a bit now


[9/10/2024 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
got distracted by dinner + such but looking at it now again


[9/10/2024 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed the addermarch border update


[9/10/2024 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
am pushing mostreve in a minute although still a little rough


[9/10/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
I'm pushing mostreve but I think it still needs a bit of work and some of the language is a bit rougher than what you had


[9/10/2024 8:53 PM] rsulfuratus
that's fine


[9/11/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure if you have thought much or care much about mechanical details of taelgar species, but i've been trying to rework at least the five core firstborn species a little to better capture mechanically the "unique firstborn magic" of each species. feeling pretty good about elves (ritual magic), halflings (telepathy/ancestral memory); have good ideas for lizardfolk (various prophecy/dreamworld things). stoneborn are a little unsettled because the lore is not totally clear but thinking around body transformation/resilience, things that have a vibe of like 'anime monk stuff' a little bit (this is how they are basically written now). 

dwarves are the biggest challenge. the current runic magic is, I feel, too complicated and a bit overworked (a species really doesn't need 10 options to pick from), and mechanically feel like a pretty mixed bag. 

the lore, however, i think is pretty clear, it just doesn't translate well mechanically. i have two ideas neither of which i love:

(1) make dwarven rune magic explicitly about creating an item, kind of like artificer infusions. i kind of tried to write it this way once but no one who has played a dwarf seems too interested in engaging with this

(2) make runes function kind of like origin feats, kind of modeled on feat chains from the giant sourcebook (Bigby's), which would give you kind of an alternate runic progression, but could be a lot of work to design


[9/11/2024 2:21 PM] .deciusmus
I like the basic vibe of inscribing a rune, but the current set of options is a bit complex


[9/11/2024 3:13 PM] .deciusmus
And the fact that each rune has its own set of rules and reset options makes it feel especially more complex


[9/11/2024 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
If I were trying to simplify, I think I'd 

(a) keep the basic idea of a rune you inscribe
(b) each rune would grant  one ability, approximately like a first level spell to the bearer, and the rune's magic always fades after it is used (some would in fact be 1st level spells, but some might be spell-like abilities)
(c) at 3rd level, gain the ability to mirror the rune, so when you inscribe it you keep an echo of it, allowing both you and someone else to gain the ability


[9/11/2024 3:29 PM] .deciusmus
that's a starting point... maybe needs a different 3rd level option, and a 5th level option


[9/11/2024 3:32 PM] .deciusmus
And perhaps dwarves are then also missing a feature, i.e. if you compare to your new elf, we have

Darkvision = darkvision
Dwarven training = keen sense
stonecunning ~= resilience of dream + trance

But the rune magic above is about the same as the ritual magic of elves, so dwarves probably need something extra (esp as speed 25 feet is a penalty)


[9/11/2024 3:44 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, that is I think a useful perspective. i kind of like the style of a "firstborn gift" choice + a "firstborn magic" choice + basic species traits, so that might suggest revising dwarves to be:

darkvision (I think perhaps buffed to 120 feet as the only underground playable species in taelgar)
stonecunning
some kind of baharazel gift (that might subsume dwarven training, and would include cantrip options which don't fit well in the runic magic idea)
rune magic that is simplified and streamlined


[9/11/2024 3:47 PM] .deciusmus
Right that pattern works well in general, I think.


[9/11/2024 3:51 PM] .deciusmus
Gift of Azar's Valor: Advantage on saving throws against fright.
Gift of Maganna's Radiance. You learn the Light cantrip.
Gift of Tarbaka's Cunning. You gain proficiency in 3 tools
Gift of Azar's Training. You gain proficiency in two martial weapons, or shields.

Just ideas but they seem relatively easy to generate (2 per baharal is probably too many though)


[9/11/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah I think one per Baharazel would make sense


[9/11/2024 3:53 PM] .deciusmus
Runes are a little bit harder as the set of good 1st level spells isn't massive they should probably mostly not be combat spells, and you already used a lot for elven magic and lots of overlap seems boring


[9/11/2024 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
for runes it might be worth doing a little more inventing of non-spell effects


[9/11/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
although some initial ideas, keeping to the existing runes:

Rune of Defense: Protection from Good and Evil
Rune of Delving: Find Traps
Rune of Exploration: Longstrider
Rune of Lore: Identify
Rune of Valor: Heroism


[9/11/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Rune of Stone: A reskinned Locate Object that works on ore/stone/etc only ("Locate Stone or Ore")


[9/11/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
Rune of Life:  Goodberry


[9/11/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
Rune of Truth: A limited form of Zone of Truth?


[9/11/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
This list doesn't have Aid or the Forge. Unseen Servant for something maybe? Purify Food and Drink?


[9/11/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
Not committed to any of the above, but it doesn't seem that hard to come up with a decent list


[9/11/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think this is probably the right direction. am going to fiddle a bit but i think the design is probably something like:
- Baharazel's Blessing (which is aimed to be roughly 1/2 as strong as an origin feat, so kind of on par with e.g. Firstborn's Gift + keen sense from elves)
- Tremorsense, improved darkvision, 30 foot speed as "main basic features"
- Rune magic which is designed to be a little weaker than Elven magic. probably something like one choice of spell or spell like effect, can use prof/2 times per day, but never learn a second effect


[9/11/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
**Bahrazel's Blessing.** Your innate connection to the Bahrazel provides you with a supernatural blessing. Choose one of the following options: 
- *Tarbaka's Blessing of Craft.* You learn the Mending cantrip. In addition, you have an uncanny ability to understand raw materials and how to shape them. You gain proficiency in two Artisan's Tool of your choice. When you Craft items with your chosen Tool, you require only half the time and raw materials that would normally be required.
- *Maganna's Blessing of Elements.* You learn two cantrips from among Light, Elementalism, Gust, Shape Water, Control Fire, and Mold Earth.
- *Azar's Blessing of Strength.* Your Hit Point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level. 
- *Oshkir's Blessing of Life.* You learn the Guidance and Spare the Dying cantrips. 
- *Uzdan's Blessing of *
- *Karthel's Blessing of *
- *Fanrukel's Blessing of *


[9/11/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
Is Maganna really related to elements? Does that fit the lore?


[9/11/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
not really but i kinda want an elemental option on there since Mold Earth has been so central to Seeker


[9/11/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
and Riswynn has Shape Water from her dwarf background


[9/11/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe that should be Karthel (runecrafter)?


[9/11/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, that might work better


[9/11/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
- *Fanrukel's Blessing of Shaping.* You learn two cantrips from among Elementalism, Shape Water, Mold Earth, Gust, Control Flames, or Light.


[9/11/2024 4:26 PM] rsulfuratus
possibly adding Thaumatury as an option as well. It is most of the non-combat Transmutation cantrips, plus Light


[9/11/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
oops meant Karthel


[9/11/2024 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Maganna's Blessing of Communication. You learn the Message cantrip, and in addition you gain proficiency in 3 additional languages.


[9/11/2024 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
that's good


[9/11/2024 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
Izgil (the dwarf in my game) uses this ability not infrequently:

When the bearer of the rune makes a ability check that uses the Arcana, History, or Religion skills (or related Knowledge competencies), and rolls a 9 or lower on the d20, they can activate this rune to treat the number rolled as a 10. Once this effect is activated, it cannot be used until the rune is inscribed again. The number of uses increases to two at 5th level and three at 11th level.


[9/11/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably a better fit for a rune than a gift though, if I was trying to keep it


[9/11/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that could be the basis of a decent rune


[9/11/2024 4:33 PM] rsulfuratus
Eric also uses Seeker's sense ore a reasonable amount, which could also be a good rune


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
right; the real issue for Izgil is that he also uses Identify from his rune a fair bit, so hard to make an exact equivalent (i.e. because it might make sense to have 2 runes one for identify, one for a "ability check take 10" - but neither of those are a great fit for a gift, and I'm not sure if he'd want to trade)


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
well if you did update to new rules, the solution would be to get Identify from your origin feat


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
you mean via magic initiate or whatever


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/11/2024 4:35 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[9/11/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually I'm wondering if the knowledge thing might work as Fanrukel's Blessing of Lore


[9/11/2024 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
It feels maybe a little powerful to have an infinite set of uses


[9/11/2024 4:37 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah you'd either need to limit to one skill and lower the floor to 8, or give it limited uses i think


[9/11/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually since Identify is a ritual spell, it is not unreasonable to have unlimited uses of that


[9/11/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
that might be a better Fanrukel's Blessing of Lore actually


[9/11/2024 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
That's true


[9/11/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
it is slightly duplicative of the vibe of elven ritual magic but i think reasonable in this case


[9/11/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
identify definitely is an dwarven-associated spell by vibes


[9/11/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
I think one case where you have a ritual is fine here


[9/11/2024 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
If you are doing rules stuff would it make sense to push it in the “playing species” mechanics rather than only D&D beyond? Easier to read/edit that way


[9/11/2024 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
just pushed. i don't have the finished species in obsidian (although could add them)


[9/11/2024 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
Campaigns/Mechanics/Species of Taelgar.md


[9/11/2024 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
Don’t see it


[9/11/2024 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
oops forgot to push


[9/11/2024 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
done now


[9/11/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
added halfling and elf, which are more or less done on d&d beyond as well


[9/12/2024 12:14 PM] rsulfuratus
i pushed updated versions of dwarf and lizardfolk (Campaigns/Mechanics/Playing a ....), and some comments on design decisions. might work a little bit on stoneborn if i have time while i'm eating lunch. will be teaching from 1:30 pm - 5 pm so won't be able to discuss anything this afternoon


[9/12/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
(elf and halfling also there but not updated from the versions on d&d beyond)


[9/12/2024 1:34 PM] .deciusmus
A few thoughts on Dwarves:

Binthuhr dwarves: I think they should get an origin feat + bonus skill prof. Just origin feat seems weak. (Although maybe from a lore perspective binthuhr dwarves should be weaker?)

Blessings:
a) Maganna's Blessing of Communication. The change-language-on-long-rest feels good and interesting. I'd keep it.

b) Uzdan's Blessing of Leadership. Fine for now. I do think something that isn't just a worse musician or worse inspiring leader would be better. I prefer this to a temp HP as from a flavor perspective "musician" is very specific


[9/12/2024 1:36 PM] rsulfuratus
re: Binthuhr, the logic is 120 feet darkvision is as good as a skill proficiency, so compared to humans they are fairly balanced. but also i don't really expect anyone to play one so i'm not sure how much it really matters. the main goal is to make them not feel obviously stronger than regular dwarves


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I guess it depends on whether human heroic inspiration is really balanced against stonecunning or not


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I guess slightly weaker than human is fine though


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I don't have strong feelings


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
And I can see how origin feat + skill might make them seem arguably stronger, which is bad


[9/12/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
So you are probably right


[9/12/2024 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah humans are fairly strong as it is so slightly weaker is not bad imo, the main goal is if Isaac is reading the new dwarf his first thought is not "why i am i bothering with a thuhr?"


[9/12/2024 1:38 PM] .deciusmus
Runes:

I like Fanrukel's Insight. It might be a little weak but it is situationally unique, so I think gains from that perspective (and for a player/character who cares about arcana/history/etc rolls feels valuable).


[9/12/2024 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
right, i like that there isnt any other way to do replace this


[9/12/2024 1:39 PM] rsulfuratus
which makes it more valuable than just another spell imo


[9/12/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
And I know my player would love to have 6 of these sitting around @ 20th level which in practice is basically equal to the rogue's reliable talent (for knowledge skills only), and feels reasonable for a high powered character


[9/12/2024 1:41 PM] .deciusmus
Goodberry I think is fine also. It is relatively stronger at low levels, in that it provides effectively a constantly renewing potion of healing. But I don't think it is useless at high levels, you just need to start thinking about it as, i.e. being used to feed a platoon or whatever, rather than just the PCs


[9/12/2024 1:45 PM] .deciusmus
For Locate Stone or Ore, what about adding the "not moving" and/or "not on a creature" as a qualifier? Alternatively, what is wrong with the "nearest"  from the original dwarf? Separately, I think losing the ability to generically sense kinda hurts the flavor a bit.


[9/12/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
the problem with nearest is it just ends up detected all your coins. it is a bit tricky to get the flavor right and i'm still iterated on this i think.


[9/12/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
in seeker's ability, there are two options: unworked/raw stuff is generic sense, worked stuff you need to specify


[9/12/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
seeker mostly uses the unworked option but to me that is actually kind of useless because who really cares if there is a vein of silver 200 feet into a cliff face?


[9/12/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
it is also particularly annoying to run for just a generic everything sense because it is either a universal treasure sensor (too strong) or it is detecting something you would rarely/ever specify in advance (raw material)


[9/12/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
my feeling from Eric is that he tries to use it but it never really feels like there is a payoff so dont want to be limited to the mechanics that exist - trying to make it more useful


[9/12/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
Hrm. I see the point


[9/12/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
For Flame Ward, I'd just leave it and increase the duration to 1 hour.


[9/12/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
although maybe that is too strong...


[9/12/2024 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
Isaac will almost certainly pick that for his Taelgar dwarf so planning on just seeing if 10 minutes feels too weak, that is best to just playtest imo


[9/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
what about:

#### Tarbaka's Flame Ward
**Casting Time:** 1 Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M
**Duration:** 1 hour

One of your appendages becomes immune to fire damage. While this effect is active, you can use your Reaction when you take Fire damage to gain resistance to the triggering damage. The first melee attack you make on your next turn that hits does an additional 1d6 fire damage.

When you use your Reaction in this way, the Flame Ward ends.


[9/12/2024 1:56 PM] .deciusmus
Basically Absorb Elements but with a long term secondary effect


[9/12/2024 1:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I like that actually, gives it a bit more utility if you want to hop through lava or something


[9/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
(and actually absorb elements gives you resistance to all damage of the trggering type until the start of your next turn)


[9/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
(which I'd keep)


[9/12/2024 1:58 PM] .deciusmus
So basically... 1 hour duration for the "appendage immunity" plus a one-time usage of absorb elements (fire). 

Feels balanced (it is basically mechanically similar to just being able to cast absorb elements) but with a nice fun rider effect


[9/12/2024 1:59 PM] rsulfuratus
now teaching so offline for 3 hours


[9/13/2024 9:39 AM] .deciusmus
I was messing around with a D&D 2024 version of Delwath a bit... D&D Beyond is tough to use as I can't select old-school invocations like Ghostly Gaze


[9/13/2024 9:51 AM] .deciusmus
But... broadly, I'd be tempted (assuming I do this when going to level 12 warlock)
(a) rearrange stats slightly to drop WIS to 10
(b) which lets me boost starting CHA to 17
(c) which means I can get to 20 via ASI @ 4th and War Caster @ 8th (which now gives a +1 to CHA)
(d) which means my 8 invocations are:
- Pact of the Blade
- Thirsting + Devouring Blade
- Ghostly Gaze
- Eye of the Rune Keeper (so weak they removed it, but important for flavor)
- 3 others TBD

That drops Eldritch Mind (which is replaced with War Caster) and Improved Pact Weapon (which I might add back in)


[9/13/2024 9:57 AM] .deciusmus
Ideas:
Ascendant Step (Levitate @ will)
Devil's Sight
Master of Myriad Forms
Visions of Distant Realms
Lifedrinker (but I don't really like the flavor)


[9/13/2024 9:58 AM] .deciusmus
or adding back in Improved Pact Weapon, although mechanically it kinda boring in that it is just effectively a +1 to hit/damage


[9/13/2024 10:59 AM] rsulfuratus
there is a lot that is still a little buggy about the 2024 D&D Beyond implementation, but hopefully a lot of these will be fixed by the time it officially releases on 9/17 (so before Colorado)


[9/13/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
(e.g. selecting older invocations)


[9/13/2024 11:03 AM] .deciusmus
yeah less worried about the actual implementation than just playing around with possibilities


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
I assume you'd have no objection to tweaking stats (the fact that War Caster gives +1 CHA now makes it a lot more compelling than Eldritch Mind)


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that's fine


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
are you planning on taking metamagic adept at 12?


[9/13/2024 11:04 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/13/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
4th level is ASI, 8th War Caster, 12th Metamagic Adept


[9/13/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
nets a +3 CHA, so then tweak starting stats to have 17 CHA (15 from point buy + 2 from background) to keep CHA 20 @ 8th level


[9/13/2024 11:05 AM] .deciusmus
but that means dropping WIS or INT to 10 from 12


[9/13/2024 11:06 AM] .deciusmus
then the main changes would be:
* Origin Feat (not thought about it yet)
* between 2 and 4 invocations


[9/13/2024 11:07 AM] .deciusmus
(where 2 would be if I kept Improved Pact Weapon + Eye of Rune Keeper; 4 would be if I replaced Eye of Rune Keeper with Comprehend Languages and also dropped Improved Pact Weapon)


[9/13/2024 11:08 AM] .deciusmus
I think spells are the same (other than being able to change Green Flame Blade to something actually useful, although I *almost* used it against the minions in the battle with the vine)


[9/13/2024 11:09 AM] rsulfuratus
I would argue you should keep Eye of the Rune Keeper for story reasons, but dropping Improved Pact Weapon certainly makes sense if there is something more interesting


[9/13/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
Delwath has been using Alter Self a lot, so Master of Myriad Forms might be a thematic and useful choice


[9/13/2024 11:11 AM] rsulfuratus
that would also free up a spell known


[9/13/2024 11:11 AM] .deciusmus
Would you consider an upgrade to Eye of the Rune Keeper to be

Senses of the Rune Keeper
You can understand the literal meaning of any language you hear or see signed, and the literal meaning of any writing you see.


[9/13/2024 11:13 AM] .deciusmus
(Basically Comprehend Language @ will, without the limit of "touching the writing"


[9/13/2024 11:14 AM] .deciusmus
Given most invocations are non-ritual spells at will, it doesn't seem overpowered


[9/13/2024 11:14 AM] rsulfuratus
(on a meeting, more later)


[9/13/2024 11:18 AM] .deciusmus
I think I'd be tempted by Ascendant Step (basically to save on Fly casting for simple things like drifting to the ground from Vdrinjashra or not having to climb) and Master of Myriad Forms.

Then still need to think about Improved Pact Weapon


[9/13/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
okay a few thoughts:

(1) On Rune Keeper: for Delwath, I don't think it really matters at all one way or the other, since of course the situations where (a) you want to understand what someone is saying, and (b) you can't spare a spell slot to cast Tongues are exceedingly rare, and anyway Kenzo can already understand all languages. 
But, in general, I'm not a big fan of "understand all language all the time" as a invocation, it feels like it really cuts off a good chunk of using language as a meaningful mechanical barrier. I'm actually not a fan of the decision in the new PHB to just collapse everything into "just Ritual cast it", e.g. I think that the Beast Speech and the Eldritch Sight invocations are interesting and still useful.


[9/13/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) On other invocations: completely fine with any of those choices.


[9/13/2024 12:39 PM] .deciusmus
On Eyes of the Rune Keeper, mostly it is just substantially weaker than Comprehend Languages. So in many ways I'm not sure it is really interesting given Comprehend Languages is very easy to get


[9/13/2024 12:40 PM] .deciusmus
(and there is a bit of a "keeping up with the jones" effect for Delwath specifically, where it feels odd that as the one with massive Charisma / party face role he is substantially behind Kenzo in the "understand what you are saying" department)


[9/13/2024 12:40 PM] rsulfuratus
well, that depends on whether the 'takes 10 minutes to cast' and 'have to touch writing' are meaningful or not


[9/13/2024 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, from a invocation standpoint, an invocation that lets you cast a first level spell at will is pretty standard


[9/13/2024 12:41 PM] .deciusmus
so it isn't even ritual cast, so much as just "cast without a spell slot"


[9/13/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
from the point of view of delwath, as I said, I don't think it really matters


[9/13/2024 12:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm just not convinced from a game design perspective that having a low-level invocation that lets you understand all spoken and writing language at will is something i would want to homebrew


[9/13/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
From a balance standpoint, if I were designing an invocation that let you cast a 1st level spell, that was already a ritual, at will, I'd make it a little better than the spell is my only point.


[9/13/2024 12:43 PM] rsulfuratus
as it trivializes language choice


[9/13/2024 12:43 PM] .deciusmus
Isn't language choice already trivialized by the existence of Comprehend Languages at some level?


[9/13/2024 12:44 PM] .deciusmus
There are a bunch of other ways to "trivialize" language choice, i.e. Magic Initiate or Ritual Caster, they all require choosing to do so


[9/13/2024 12:44 PM] rsulfuratus
a little, but to me it feels different to have an ability that says "you just understand everything" as opposed to having a spell you can cast


[9/13/2024 12:45 PM] rsulfuratus
to me, ritual casting Comprehend Languages is rarely, if ever, useful for the spoken word part


[9/13/2024 12:45 PM] .deciusmus
I guess. I think the game effect of the difference is fairly minimal.


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
Really? There are lots of situations where you know you are going into a social situation and in most games taking 10 min to ritual cast before you do is pretty easy to do


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. the main circumstance you'd want to understand language but not speak it is when you are eavesdropping or similar, and typically you wouldn't have 10 minutes to ritual cast


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but comprehend doesn't let you speak, just understand


[9/13/2024 12:46 PM] .deciusmus
sure, but that is still useful in any social situation, i.e. where the other people might talk in their own language


[9/13/2024 12:47 PM] .deciusmus
I think D&D already has a mechanical issue with languages because they are binary


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess it is just my dmign style, i can't think of a time i've had npcs have a side conversation in a different language, but i do sometimes have enemies yell to each in other in combat


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] rsulfuratus
*side conversation during a social situation


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
The giants


[9/13/2024 12:48 PM] .deciusmus
but Delwath had already cast tongues


[9/13/2024 12:49 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[9/13/2024 12:49 PM] .deciusmus
Plus some stuff in Ursk where casting a spell wasn't possible


[9/13/2024 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, i don't think it matter for delwath and it is perfectly reasonable for delwath to just understand all languages


[9/13/2024 12:50 PM] .deciusmus
Scrying is another scenario


[9/13/2024 12:50 PM] rsulfuratus
right but when you are scrying there is basically no situation in which you can't just cast tongues


[9/13/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
Its a big tax on slots to have to cast tongues


[9/13/2024 12:51 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, realistically, I guess it rarely matters. But I'm always nervous to burn 2 slots in that type of situation


[9/13/2024 12:52 PM] .deciusmus
(and back when I only had 2 slots and was spamming scrys, a ritual comprehend is much better use of time than scry + tongues)


[9/13/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
My point is actually just a philosophical one, which is that from a pure in world usefulness perspective, I don't really think "read all writing without touching it" necessarily would win over "cast comprehend languages as written as a ritual"


[9/13/2024 12:53 PM] rsulfuratus
i think what i would actually do if I were homebrewing this from first principles is leave eyes of the rune keeper as a 2+ level invocation, and then make a new higher level invocation that is you can understand all spoken or written language


[9/13/2024 12:53 PM] .deciusmus
See from a pure homebrew balance perspective I think it doesn't work once warlocks have access to ritual spells


[9/13/2024 12:54 PM] rsulfuratus
perhaps you'd make eyes of the rune keeper be: "You always have the Comprehend Languages spell prepared. In addition, you can read all writing/"


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
That is closer to balanced


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe not worth taking? i'm not sure. i mean, delwath took eyes of the rune keeper a while ago and i think got a fair bit of value out of it


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] rsulfuratus
of course 2024 warlocks couldn't ritual cast and had much more limited slots...


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
Right, but Delwath had no option to take Comprehend Languages


[9/13/2024 12:55 PM] .deciusmus
and no option to ritual cast


[9/13/2024 12:56 PM] rsulfuratus
*2014 warlocks


[9/13/2024 12:56 PM] .deciusmus
If I could have just learned Comprehend Language as a spell and been able to ritual cast? I'm not sure Eyes of the Rune Keeper is worth it over some other invocation


[9/13/2024 12:57 PM] .deciusmus
For example, if it was a choice between Comprehend Languages as a known spel + Alter Self at will, vs Alter Self as a known spell + Eyes of the Rune Keeper it isn't even a close decision


[9/13/2024 12:58 PM] rsulfuratus
sure. i mean in 2014 alter self at will was 15+ level. there is a lot of power creep in the 2024 warlock, more than many other classes


[9/13/2024 12:59 PM] rsulfuratus
which i have mixed feelings about because I think some of the lower-power invocations mechanically are very flavorful (also see the doesn't need to sleep one), but the more powerful invocations become the more feel-bad it is to take those


[9/13/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
what would be more flavorful imo is scaling invocations, or at least "low level" and "high level" versions. e.g., at 3rd level or whatever, "read all writing" isn't necessarily a bad choice. by 5th level, you probably want it to be stronger, and by 12th level definitely. 

but you could do something like:
(no level req): read all writing
(requires 5th level): understand all written, spoken, signed language
(requiress 11th level): understand all written, spoken, signed language. cast tongues at will. 
(requires 17th level): understand and speak any written, spoken, signed language. you can use spell scrolls of any class.


[9/13/2024 1:07 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, not sure any of this really matters for delwath specifically, who i think should just get a homebrew invocation


[9/13/2024 1:07 PM] .deciusmus
sure, although if you are offering up "cast tongues at will" for I wouldn't say no


[9/14/2024 10:32 AM] rsulfuratus
what do you think of this? 

Uzdan's Blessing of Leadership. When you finish a [rule]Long Rest[/rule], you can inspire bravery in yourself and your allies. Choose a number of creatures up to your Proficiency Bonus. Each target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to twice your Proficiency Bonus. While a character has these Temporary Hit Points, they are immune to the [condition]Frightened[/condition].


[9/14/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
This is supposed to be about 1/2 a origin feat?


[9/14/2024 12:25 PM] .deciusmus
Inspiring Leader feat is character level not prof bonus temp HP... I think this is balanced on its own, in a way, but it seems unfortunate it doesn't synergize with inspiring leader feat. It feels like a character who wants this kind of thing might want to take both, but they kinda clash


[9/14/2024 1:04 PM] rsulfuratus
about to go out for a bit, but yeah, it is tough to get something satisfying because temp hp effects all clash with each other. 

and it is hard to think of other good effects that have the flavor of "inspiring allies" and aren't too complicated

the other option I thought about was just a "fear resistance aura" - you have advantage on saves against being Frightened, as do all allies within 30 feet of you or something. not tied to rest, just always-on


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
is there anything canonical about when Umbreath established Duskmire? in the Duskmire note you have in the 600s but is that set in stone? 

i'm dropping a warning stone in the next adventure for my Addermarch campaign that is near a place of easy travel (not quite a portal, but a place where fey can cross to the material plane with less effort)


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] rsulfuratus
trying to figure out what language the warning signs might be in


[9/16/2024 8:24 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing canonical.


[9/16/2024 8:25 PM] .deciusmus
But it has to be before Cloudspinner was imprisoned


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i was more wondering about pushing it back a bit. 600s would be when Drankor had already established in Addermarch


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
say to 200 or 300


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] .deciusmus
For the expansion narrative to work. Could be much older though. Who knows how long Umbraeth was hanging out in the Darkwood


[9/16/2024 8:26 PM] rsulfuratus
so by the time Drankorians arrive, the Ethlenn/Umbaeth split has already happened


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that probably works


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] .deciusmus
An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realm in the Cleenseau folder has a few hints


[9/16/2024 8:29 PM] rsulfuratus
will take a look


[9/16/2024 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
But something like 250-300 would work fine.


[9/16/2024 8:30 PM] .deciusmus
I think


[9/16/2024 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
on a totally separate D&D topic - I realized recently when talking to Isaac that Epic Boons just have a character level 19 requirement, so you can technically take them at any level that gives you a feat as long as you are character level 19. 

so theoretically if Delwath were willing to give up 9th level spells, you could take an epic boon at both warlock 16/sorcerer 3, and warlock 16/sorcerer 4


[9/16/2024 8:31 PM] rsulfuratus
(which would also give you 22 Cha)


[9/16/2024 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
Also means giving up a 4th pact magic slot


[9/16/2024 8:33 PM] rsulfuratus
ah that's true. that might be worth more than the 1/day 9th level spell


[9/16/2024 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
I mean it will be a while. Would take sor 4 before level 20 anyway. So can wait and see


[9/16/2024 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
true


[9/18/2024 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
I'm doing a little notes cleanup and just reading some random scattered things...

For something like the winter market for halflings in Adderfell (which would tie in nicely to Viatela (which doesn't have a good note, itself, but..)

What's the best way to suggest something like that? Change the text and tag status/tim? Just chat in discord?


[9/19/2024 10:42 PM] rsulfuratus
I've been super busy at work - just looking at D&D now. I think add a comment to the note and tag status/tim, possibly also mention on Discord


[9/19/2024 10:44 PM] rsulfuratus
btw, I'm working on updating homebrew subclasses to 2024 rules. one clear design trend (which I don't feel completely obligated to stick) is to limit the accessibility of half-caster-exclusive spells. hexblade by default has a lot of paladin smite spells on its expanded list. other than banishing smite, delwath almost never uses any of them, so i am considering replacements, maybe just keeping 2 smites (banishing + one other)


[9/19/2024 11:03 PM] .deciusmus
It is mechanically useful to have a non-concentration smite in addition to banishing but 3 smites is probably excessive


[9/19/2024 11:04 PM] .deciusmus
It might be nice to homebrew a themed smite or two


[9/19/2024 11:07 PM] .deciusmus
Yalik'i’s smite of frost 
1d8 cold damage/level
Save or restrained (or maybe just zero speed or reduced speed) until end of next turn


[9/19/2024 11:09 PM] .deciusmus
Blinding smite could be
Nishir’s smite of the talons
(Effect like poking at eyes?)


[9/20/2024 12:01 AM] rsulfuratus
here is my current list. struggling with level 3; a homebrew smite could work there (although you could also just take the eldritch smite invocation for a non-concentration, non-bonus-action smite).

1st level: sleep (theme connection: moonlight, evening, night); shield (theme connection: hunter)
2nd level: invisibility (theme connection: sneaking up on prey), Mind Spike (theme connection: tracking, hunter **not sure about this one**)
3rd level: Fly? Conjure Animals? Spirit Shroud? Blinding Smite? surprisingly few hunter/moon/night/sleep/forest associated 3rd level spells
4th level: Fount of Moonlight (theme: moonlight, hunter; mechanically similar to spirit shroud - could drop this for spirit shroud at 3rd), Hallucinatory Terrain (theme: camouflage for the hunt)
5th level: Banishing Smite (theme: hunter), Dream (theme: sleep - scrying is also potentially thematic, of course doesn't matter for delwath since you use both of those spells a lot)

Some of the stuff on the current list (enthrall, tongues, ice storm) I can't figure out what the rationale was. 

Open to suggestions especially for 3rd and possibly something better than Mind Spike for 2nd. Or something else for 4th to replace Fount of Moonlight, and then would be easy to add Spirit Shroud to 3rd.


[9/20/2024 10:53 AM] rsulfuratus
recalling that I think we had decided the flavor of the subclass was "Meswati" not just Yezali, rethinking spells a bit:

level 1: shield (yezali); sleep (midri, hibernation)
level 2: invisibility (yezali, tracking/sneaking up on prey); alter self or spider climb or ?? (k'onisati, transformation)
level 3: ??? (yezali - maybe spirit shroud if replace 4th level yezali option), tongues (taraka, communication/stories)
level 4: fount of moonlight (yezali), ice storm (yalik'i)
level 5: banishing smite (yezali), scrying (nisir)

possible alternative spells for each tanshi:
yalik'i: detect thoughts (2nd - the "listen everywhere" and "clear thoughts" vibes), calm emotions (2nd - also "clear thoughts" theme), rime's binding ice (2nd), cone of cold (5th), armor of agathys (1st)
k'onisati: polymorph (4th, transformation), giant insect (4th, *although the new version of this spell has some broken interactions), fly (3rd, insect/transformation), longstrider (1st), jump (1st)
nisir: arcane eye (4th), see invisibility (2nd)

tongues seems obvious for taraka
for yezali lots of alternatives even avoiding smites 

happy to take your suggestions just wasn't sure why we picked some of the old spells, and kind of feel like additional smites beyond banishing are kind of unneeded (another concentration option probably rarely gets used; blinding could be a 3rd level non-concentration option although if you have a spare invocation eldritch smite is much better since it doesn't take a bonus action and you can stack it with banishing smite)


[9/20/2024 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
The current structure has a Yezali themed spell each level, plus a 2nd one from a different tanshi.

So that comes out as:

1st Level: Shield (Yezali) / Sleep (Midri, hiberation)
2nd Level: Shining Smite (Yezali) / Enthrall (K'onisati / shimmering/distraction of butterflies)
3rd Level: Blinding Smite / Tongues (taraka/stories)
4th Level: Shadow of Moil / Ice Storm (yaliki)
5th Level: Banishing Smite / SCryhing (Nisir)


[9/20/2024 12:31 PM] .deciusmus
I actually like all 5 of the non-Yezali ones and don't see any reason to change them


[9/20/2024 12:32 PM] .deciusmus
I am planning on taking alter self at will as an invocation, so having it as a spell is very meh. Spider climb is fine-ish, but I actually used Enthrall at least once in game, so I'd rather not arbirtarily take it away


[9/20/2024 12:34 PM] .deciusmus
For the Yezali spells on the other hand, happy to move away from "all smites" if you are feeling like they should be more restricted.


[9/20/2024 12:38 PM] .deciusmus
Happy to swap Fount of Moonlight for Spirit Shroud, Fount of Moonlight is better for sure than Shadow of Moil themeatically, and functionally close enough toSpirit shroud that it doesn't matter


[9/20/2024 1:23 PM] .deciusmus
Also have no particular attachment to Blinding Smite; although a 3rd level Yezali spell is not obvious to me... some ideas:
Conjure Animals seems like a good fit. Other ideas:
Haste (kinda powerful)
A reskinned Hunger of Hadar (to be something like attacking vines or beasts?)
Lighting Arrow is an interesting one (although Ranger-only, maybe you are trying to avoid that)
Nondetection (i.e. hiding vibe). Maybe overly useful? I would cast it all the time.

Alternatively, go with Spirit Shroud for 3rd and then 4th Yezali... ideas:

Conjure Woodland Creature (maybe with a type other than fey?)
Dominate Beast
Faithful Hound (although I can't tell if it is meant to be able to follow you around or just sit in a single spot. less useful if it just sits somewhere)
Freedom of Movement


[9/20/2024 1:24 PM] .deciusmus
On 2nd level, Shining Smite is, I believe, literally the only way the party has to deal with invisible foes. Kinda a shame to lose it, although Invisiblity is of course a very useful spell


[9/20/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
completely happy to leave all the non-yezali ones, if you are happy with them. had just forgotten the thematics we had worked out


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
re: invisible, sickening radiance also prevents invisibility, no?


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
yes of course


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
forgot that


[9/20/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in fact you've relied on that feature at least a few times.


[9/20/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
that's more delwath's style anyway


[9/20/2024 1:50 PM] rsulfuratus
i thought about conjure animals but as an area effect concentration i wasn't sure if you would likely ever cast it over sickening radiance so not sure if it would feel kind of wasted


[9/20/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess the advantage of Conjure Animals is you can move it around when you move


[9/20/2024 1:54 PM] rsulfuratus
the most thematic seems to me either:
shield / invisibility / conjure animals / fount of moonlight / banishing smite
shield / invisibility / spirit shroud / dominate beast/ banishing smite


[9/20/2024 2:09 PM] rsulfuratus
meswati patron and tanshi champion should work now on the 2024 warlock if you want to mess around. went with conjure animals + fount of moonlight but can change.

[9/20/2024 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
elves also work so should be set if you want to rebuild delwath


[9/20/2024 2:10 PM] rsulfuratus
let me know if there are any issues you find (besides taking old invocations, which will need some kind of workaround for)


[9/20/2024 2:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the sorcerer bonus spells are drop downs in the character creator - default would be sanctuary and lesser restoration at 3rd. i think by the rules you could have 2 additional cleric spells besides those two.


[9/20/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
Am I supposed to have 2 Elven Rituals?


[9/20/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
Yes


[9/20/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
D&D Beyond is really bad.


[9/20/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
If you don't pick one of the "standard" backgrounds there is no way to add ability scores or origin feat


[9/20/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
The Origin Feats list is honestly a bit weak as well


[9/20/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
should be a  Custom 2024 Background option


[9/20/2024 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
then you pick ability scores on the Ability Score page


[9/20/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
ah, I didn't look down to homebrew


[9/20/2024 4:11 PM] .deciusmus
Can I take the following origin feat:

Quartermaster

You gain proficiency with Cook's Tools and Tinker's Tools (or maybe just Cook's Tools).

Nourishing Meal. As you finish a Short or Long Rest, provided you have access to food or water, you prepare a nourishing meal and give Heroic Inspiration to allies who partake of the food. The number of allies you can affect in this way equals your Proficiency Bonus


[9/20/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
It's just Musician but reflavored to make sense for Delwath


[9/20/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
that's fine. i think just cook's tools though


[9/20/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
this should work: https://www.dndbeyond.com/feats/1811993-camp-cook


[9/20/2024 4:24 PM] rsulfuratus
this might also work: https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/414186-quartermaster


[9/20/2024 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
background works; doesn't let me pick stats though


[9/20/2024 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
have to manually add +s on the ability page


[9/20/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
ah i know why. i can fix that easily, i just need to add it as an option to the homebrew species.


[9/20/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
if you use a homebrew background + an official species you get the ASI choice on the abilities page, but it is because it is secretly coded in the species logic


[9/20/2024 4:30 PM] .deciusmus
I assume if I'm tinkering I should go with Warlock 12 rather than Warlock 11


[9/20/2024 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/20/2024 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
wow sorcerers get a lot more spells


[9/20/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/20/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i think i fixed the elf ASI, although there are a few formatting quirks i haven't figured out yet


[9/20/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
so I net out with 4 spells to pick

I swapped Elementalism for Green Flame Blade and Sorcerous Burst for Booming Blade


[9/20/2024 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
Invocations are a bit broken as I can't take the 2014 ones  - Ghostly Gaze in particular. Are you home brewing a better Eyes of the Rune Keeper?


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't think there is a straightforward way to homebrew invocations in D&D Beyond, and haven't thought about this much yet


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
The easiest way to do it is probably just leave the invocation blank and homebrew a feat


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
and then add a custom feat


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] rsulfuratus
ah yeah that probably works fine. does the eldritch adept feat let you take old invocations?


[9/20/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
yes, I think so


[9/20/2024 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
sort of


[9/20/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
it does let you take the old ones, but it doesn't realize Delwath is a "warlock" so it doesn't let you pick the ones that had pre-requisites


[9/20/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
so I can't actually pick Ghostly Gaze


[9/20/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
can pick Eyes of the Rune Keeper


[9/20/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
also can't add it more than once


[9/20/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
so it is of limited use


[9/20/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
the not repeatable would be easy to fix by just cloning the feat as a homebrew feat with a different name but the prerequistes are probably hard coded


[9/20/2024 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So basically I have a new Delwath but still need:
(a) to pick a handful of spells that ended up as new spells, either from invocations (Alter Self), new patron spells (Invisibility, Fount of Moonlight) or just sorcerers getting more spells
(b) figure out invocations. Definitely taking Alter Self at will. Keeping Pact of Blade + the 2 extra attack ones and Ghostly Gaze. Dropping Eldritch Mind as I took War Caster instead. 

That leaves 3 remaining slots.

**Slot 1: Eye of Rune Keeper.**
 But I really think you should home brew it to be something better because the Elven Ritual feat gives me Comprehend Languages with a 3 hour duration and a 1 minute ritual, so pretty easy to just constantly cast it. 

I am happy to pay a plot tax and keep it, but it would really make more sense to drop Eye of the Rune Keeper for something better and get by on the elven comprehend from a game mechanics standpoint, esp because none of the other elven ritual spells feel that sensible (mage armor silly, alarm silly given I have it already, and the animal vibe doesn't feel quite right for delwath)


[9/20/2024 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
**Slot 2: Improved Pact Weapon or ??**
Improved Pact Weapon is not that useful as it functionally just gives a +1. That isn't nothing, but might not be worth a slot. Eldritch Smite for example might be better.


[9/20/2024 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
Or Life Drinker, although the vibe is a bit eh


[9/20/2024 5:17 PM] rsulfuratus
I kind of was thinking Eldritch Smite fulfills the desire for a non-concentration smite when designing the patron spell list, which only has banishing. so i think if you do want the non-concentration smite option then you should take Eldritch Smite


[9/20/2024 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
definitely the vibe on Eldritch Smite feels more Delwath-y than lifedrinker


[9/20/2024 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
Then for Slot 3, something random and not weapon related for sure. Probably one of
* Devil's Sight
* Ascendant Step (levitate at will)
* Visions of Distant Realms


[9/20/2024 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, that makes sense. Am leaning towards Edritch Smite not Imporved Pact or Lifedrinker


[9/20/2024 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
the other option is Pact of the Tome + Gift of the Protectors


[9/20/2024 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
Tome by itself is a bit meh. But Death Ward 1/day on 5 people is rather good


[9/20/2024 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
true. the tome doesn't have quite the right vibe, but reskinned as some kind of tanish ritual item it works well actually


[9/20/2024 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
but Delwath is very full up on cantrips


[9/20/2024 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, you really have little need of more cantrips. so you are basically paying 2 invocation slots for the gift of the protectors


[9/20/2024 5:23 PM] .deciusmus
I mean Unseen Servant and Tensors Floating Disk could be fun ritual spells


[9/20/2024 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
I think that I am kind of not interested in trying to homebrew an eyes of the runekeeper alternative, but also don't think there is any reason you need to pay a story tax to keep it. you can always just imagine you swapped it out at the current level up


[9/20/2024 5:25 PM] rsulfuratus
that said the downside to comprehend languages is you can't read writing in the mirror. not sure if that has ever come up. i think wellby lipreading comes up more


[9/20/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
It probably has a few times, I can't remember


[9/20/2024 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
At some level, I don't actually have a ton of invocations I want


[9/20/2024 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
so, i think what i'll do is homebrew a ghostly gaze feat when i get a chance, and then if you decide to keep eyes of runekeeper you can do it via the eldritch adept feat. 

if you decide to take improved pact weapon instead of eldritch smite i can homebrew that too

i think anything else should be fine to just pick


[9/20/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
I do feel like the eyes of the rune keeper thing is annoying because ultimately, from a game perspective, having writing come up in the mirror that we can't read is going to feel crappy. But mechanically you are effectively giving me comprehend language for free


[9/20/2024 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
via the elven thing


[9/20/2024 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
So basically, eyes of the rune keeper is effectively the "you can use comprehend languages on writing you can't touch"


[9/20/2024 5:34 PM] .deciusmus
which is a pretty crappy invocation. but I'm hesistant to drop it, because if I do, and writing comes up in the mirror or something, I'm going to be annoyed


[9/20/2024 5:41 PM] rsulfuratus
i do get that, although on the other hand you are getting a ton of new stuff already. let me think about it a bit


[9/20/2024 9:32 PM] .deciusmus
Nathaniel just texted me to ask who umbraeth is


[9/20/2024 9:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah we just finished a session and they met a naiad who mentioned umbreath


[9/20/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
he is really leaning into the secret fey connectin of the de brune family


[9/20/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
I told him Umbraeth was better known as the Gloomshaper and is dangerous and too stay away.  And it wasn't safe to talk. And to ask the Squire of the Whispering Wind about Umbraeth


[9/20/2024 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
he's sitting next to me


[9/20/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
ah


[9/20/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
what did the naiad tell them about umbraeth


[9/20/2024 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
just that his duskhounds sometimes ride through the darkwood, and to be careful


[9/20/2024 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm looking.... (nathaniel)


[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
ooh, I stated up a duskhound. they are nasty.


[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
The game I DM for is about to fight one


[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
But you gotta be 6-7th level to take them on, probably


[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah they aren't going to the darkwood anytime soon


[9/20/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
they just got to level 3


[9/20/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
I should move some of my bestiary to a shared folder


[9/20/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
I stat stuff up in obisidian


[9/20/2024 9:41 PM] .deciusmus
BTW I've been trying to clean up some status tags... Trying to use "blankslate" more for stuff that just needs pure invention rather than WIP, unless I actually have specific ideas about a page

[9/21/2024 9:15 AM] rsulfuratus
thinking a lilttle more about rune keeper / comprehend languages / etc.

i think one reasonable point is that if you are going to get a pick 2 choice from elven ritual magic, it would probably be nice to have a couple more options. this would be easy to add, but i'm having trouble coming up with interesting rituals (or ritual-esque spells, generally non-ritual spells that have a long duration without a benefit to spamming them). 

the other point is that delwath is probably getting the biggest power spike of anyone in the party with the switch (kenzo is close or possibly greater in combat, but delwath gets a lot of new spells, even compared to the playtest, and especially given the rebalancing of a lot of at-will invocations). so is it really that important to squeeze the most value out of every last choice? 

finally, i basically have just today to get the entire colorado adventure written, so i don't really feel like i have a lot of spare bandwidth for extra homebrew.


[9/21/2024 9:18 AM] rsulfuratus
so let me propose this:

if you come up with a couple more options for elven ritual magic that seem  elf-appropriate, i'm absolutely happy to add those elf, and you can take that instead of comprehend languages, and continue to live with rune keeper + tongues

otherwise i just don't really have the bandwidth to homebrew different invocations so kind of feel like you just have to decide whether wasting an invocation slot for the option to read writing you can't touch is worthwhile


[9/21/2024 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
For elves...

Elmerca's Insight: Augury (or does that step on lizardfolk toes?)
Aldanor's Purity: Purify Food and Drink
Aldanor's Aide: Unseen Servant (not sure about that one)

Still trying to think of one more for Elmerca. Skywrite maybe but seems a little powerful.


[9/21/2024 10:26 AM] .deciusmus
There are so few ritual spells that it is hard to come up with much


[9/21/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah this was my problem. was feeling like maybe needed to invent a few equivalent-power rituals to fill things out. 

was trying to avoid augury (lizardfolk) and identify (dwarf)


[9/21/2024 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe not committed to last one


[9/21/2024 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
but you are good at inventing spells so...


[9/21/2024 10:28 AM] .deciusmus
I might play around a bit, Dana is in Florida so I'm spending some time on D&D stuff today

[9/21/2024 10:58 AM] .deciusmus
As far as the rest of it, though, I actually _like_ Comprehend Languages as a elven ritual for Delwath. It fits into his backstory pretty well, and if we were replaying the game with these rules from the start I absolutely would have taken it at 3rd level.

I actually don't even really need another invocation, to be honest. The extra spells are a huge power boost, esp with the revamped patron spells (which frees up even more slots). And just going to 12th level is a big step up as extra metamagic is useful. 

But it just feels crappy to end up with a functionality pointless invocation, even though actually from a overall character perspective having 7 instead of 8 invocations is still mostly a step up.

Partly also the invocations in 2024 are just better; so the opportunity cost feels higher. When I took Rune of Eye Keeper not a lot of the other invocations seemed that appealing, either because I didn't have the levels or because they were tied to Eldritch Blast or very "pact with the devil warlock" vibe-y.

I'm not really looking for a proper "homebrewed" invocation in the sense of something that has well-thought out balance and that you'd publish in D&D Beyond, I'd just like something to make Eyes of the Rune Keeper not feel totally pointless (esp because I feel like Delwath is much closer to Elmerca than Aldanor, and in-game elven comprehend languages really makes the most sense).

My idea was something like: You can understand all spoken or signed languages and read all writing. 

Basically an always on comprehend + existing eye of rune keeper. Mechanically not that different than just casting the spell every 3 hours, but it can't be dispelled, isn't a spell so i.e. could have used it in Ursk, etc.


[9/21/2024 10:59 AM] .deciusmus
but from a power-perspective I'm happy to agree to also take the comprehend language ritual, so mechanically it isn't that different. I don't need even more slots.


[9/21/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm, i guess i misunderstood a bit. if you want to (a) take comprehend languages elven ritual, and (b) take eyes of the rune keeper, but also (c) handwave that the combination of the two means that comprehend languages is always activate as a "eyes of the rune keeper" effect instead of a spell, that is totally fine by me


[9/21/2024 11:01 AM] rsulfuratus
i thought the problem was spending two character options for the same thing


[9/21/2024 11:02 AM] rsulfuratus
but if you are fine spending two character options for the same thing then it seems reasonable to make them synergistic not conflicting


[9/21/2024 11:02 AM] .deciusmus
It is more that I have so many character options that I don't mind spending 2 of them for the same thing


[9/21/2024 11:02 AM] .deciusmus
As long as there is some kind of synergistic benefit even if just handwaved


[9/21/2024 11:04 AM] rsulfuratus
okay if that's the case then i'd say that while it still might be useful to have say 1 more elmerca and 1 more aldanor elven ritual option if you are feeling inspired, for delwath i'd just set it up as comprehend + eyes and handwave the synergistic interaction


[9/21/2024 11:05 AM] rsulfuratus
it would effectively be like homebrewing eyes of the rune keeper to be an invocation that says: you can read all writing. also if you know the comprehend languages spell, it is always active for you


[9/21/2024 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
with the not actually a spell caveat


[9/21/2024 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
(although not clear to me that elven ritual magic itself is actually a spell in the first place)


[9/21/2024 11:06 AM] rsulfuratus
any more than e.g. you could "dispel" the gift of the firstborn and change aldanor elves speed to 30 feet


[9/21/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
Do you remember if there is a way to do up until dates?


[9/21/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
I'm fixing the page for the Army of the South, which was basically disbanded and reformed during my current campaign. I was thinking of writing two descriptions, one for "dates before 1721" and one for "dates after 1721" but I'm not sure if we have a way to do that?


[9/21/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I semi-implmeneted this but not sure I ever tested it


[9/21/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
if the date ends with a letter, it theoretically parses it


[9/21/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
"b" is the default before behavior


[9/21/2024 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
For now I am just writing the 1720 version in a date block and leaving a %% note %% for what happens post.


[9/21/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
"a" strips the comment if the current date is after the date in the comment


[9/21/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., "%%^Date:1725a%%" should remove the text between that and the end block if the current date for the vault export is after 1725


[9/21/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
but, it might not work because I don't think I ever tested it against anything


[9/21/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
oh huh actually Arryn III has an "a" tag


[9/21/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
but it doesn't work because my taelgarverse tag has both versions: https://tsackton.github.io/taelgarverse/people/historical-figures/sembaran-royalty/arryn-iii/


[9/21/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
so consider it an unimplemented feature


[9/21/2024 3:19 PM] .deciusmus
I'm amusing myself by trying to clean up the unknown status tags. 

I know we've talked about status tags a lot, but two things...

(a) I'm adding status/needswork to stubs that clearly need more info. For example the page for Vimfrost. There is clearly a lot of world information about him, so just filling in the header to have some bio details isn't sufficient.

(b) I'm struggling a bit with the best tag for something that just needs rethinking. i.e. the page for Devils. It reads as basically complete, as far as it goes, but given all the recent discussions aorund metaphysicals of souls and the history of humanity it isn't clear the old info is necssary accurate. Is status/update the right tag for that? Or should we have something like status/needswork/rethink?


[9/21/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I've been using status/update specifically for notes that have been affected by recent campaign events. e.g. I think Milo and Tilly might have those


[9/21/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
I think status/needswork/rethink would be fine, or just base status/needswork


[9/21/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
I would prefer to keep update specifically to "campaign events have affected this" instead of "not sure this is canon" to have a clear way to say "the stuff on this page in complete but might specifically be out-of-date"


[9/21/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
right makes sense


[9/21/2024 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
I think I'll use status/needswork/rethink


[9/21/2024 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
There is a category of page that's kinda  hard to place..


[9/21/2024 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
I guess more accurately I need a status for "I don't know the status, Tim needs to decide it"


[9/21/2024 4:12 PM] rsulfuratus
what's wrong with status/tim?


[9/21/2024 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I can do that


[9/21/2024 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
There are a lot of pages like say Adamanatine, which is set status/stub


[9/21/2024 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
But that's wrong, the page already has a complete header


[9/21/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
If it was a page I had created, I'd write a sentence about adamantine and call it done, but I don't know if you have deeper thoughts/interestes in the background of adamantine or not


[9/21/2024 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
But I can just set status/tim on those easily enough that probably works


[9/21/2024 4:15 PM] rsulfuratus
some of those might be old tags - originally status/stub meant "nothing exists yet" rather than "needs a header"

there is also a category of notes that are kind of markers for things that definitely exist in the world, but that i'm not sure what else to say about them


[9/21/2024 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that's part of what I'm trying to clean up


[9/21/2024 4:16 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it is useful for status/stub to mean "needs header and basic one-two sentences" a


[9/21/2024 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
so for adamantine - all we know about it (unless there is more that has come up in your game) is that the dwarves near Raven's Hold used to mine it before the great war,  it can be used to make high-quality armor, and it somehow is useful to stabilize or channel or otherwise construct magic items


[9/21/2024 4:17 PM] .deciusmus
For me, things that definitely exist but I am not sure what to say I either set
(a) status/needswork/blankslate, if I feel like the thing/place/person is very important and kinda needs to have info made up before it could be used
(b) no status, if the thing/place/person is background-y and not critical, and I don't really know if/when more info would be useful


[9/21/2024 4:17 PM] rsulfuratus
(I agree about status/stub, btw)


[9/21/2024 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. Embry and Tafolwern gets status/needswork/blankslate - I'd definitely need to do prep for them before anyone shows up
But something like the Semb river doesn't *need* anything other than a sentence describing where it is. Maybe some color details are nice, but it isn't important. So no need to add the needswork tag


[9/21/2024 4:18 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that makes sense


[9/21/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
But for some pages, I don't know whether in your mind it is more a "blank slate" kind of a thing or a "its done with 1 sentence" kind of thing


[9/21/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
But I'm just going to tag those status/tim with a note on why


[9/21/2024 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that's fine


[9/21/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
in some cases there are things that could become a big important thing if i found a reason for it, or could just be meaningless background if it never comes up


[9/21/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
but i guess that is kind of by definition not "blankslate"


[9/21/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
Right, for those I think leaving empty status is best


[9/21/2024 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
I am also doing a lot of "dump notes from discord into %% on the page and set status/needswork/internal


[9/21/2024 4:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that is very useful


[9/21/2024 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
the goal here is that in theory, if someone was feeling like "working on taelgar" but didn't have a specific goal, then in theory one thing you could do would be to just pick a random page with status/needswork/internal and rewrite it


[9/21/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
In theory, status/needswork/wip should probably also be accompanied by either status/mike or status/tim and would mean "someone has thoughts/details/in game plans" for this page, don't invent stuff without discussing with them first

whereas status/needswork/external would typically mean "we discussed this in email or discord but the notes are not on this page"


[9/21/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
status/needswork/external i also use for things that haven't been ported over from OneNote, but i guess generally that should ideally get a comment indicating the external source is onenote so you don't try to find the relevant emails (although usually pretty obvious)


[9/21/2024 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
one thing that could also be useful - given that my family addermarch game is a lot more likely to overlap with sembara than any of the other things i'm running - is a good way to tag whether there are critical details to reuse a thing that are missing. i guess status/needswork/wip is maybe enough?


[9/21/2024 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
but, for example, Eskbridge is currently tagged just as [place]. but the note is pretty thin. it isn't clear if there is relevant detail that would need to be incorporated if, for example, Nathaniel's character ends up going back home for an adventure


[9/21/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
I think  in general

status/needswork/internal should mean "note is not in good shape, but all the canonical info is somewhere in the shared obsidian repo"
status/needswork/external with no other tag means "note not in good shape, discussion happened in discord or email, but it is shared"
status/needswork/blankslate OR alternatively, no status tag means "no ideas really, invent away"
status/needswork/wip should always have a status/mike or status/tim and the status tag refers to the person who has the ideas


[9/21/2024 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
status/needswork/external with a status/mike or status/tim means "I have details in private/unshared" notes. This is loose. Would sometimes not happen but ideally there would be a %% comment although realistically mostly we know who has the notes for external tags


[9/21/2024 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
status/update means "game events have impacted this but are not on the page"
status/needswork/rethink means "this page probably needs discussion or reconsideration" based on changes elsewhere


[9/21/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
I was also thinking it might be good to have something like

status/active/clee or status/active/addermarch or status/active/dufr

but especially for clee and addermarch

as a way of flagging characters that are active and important and might change from session to session vs more background stuff


[9/21/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
makes sharing easier


[9/21/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
there are also a handful of other status tags I've used. e.g. header for notes that just need to clean up header information, usually whereabouts, or refactor for notes with kind of complicated metadata that should probably be organized differently (usually for notes that refer to a specific example of an item that is not unique)


[9/21/2024 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I like status/active as a general tagging concept as well


[9/21/2024 4:35 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, we probably don't need to bother even with the campaign or other details. But I would find it useful to tell between "background npc" and "important part of addermarch" and it would probably be helpful for you as well with reusing my sembara stuff


[9/21/2024 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
right, i think probably it is pretty obvious with status/active in what sense it is active


[9/21/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
Right this makes sense.


[9/21/2024 4:37 PM] .deciusmus
So for example, my page for Areschera, one a shapeshifting fey villian in the current adventure for Cleenseau, I've changed from just status/stub to

---
tags: [person, status/active, status/stub, status/needswork/wip, status/mike]
---


[9/21/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
if I get around to typing up what I know, I'd change to just status/active


[9/21/2024 4:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense


[9/21/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
whereas Ascombe, a small village my PCs visited, is

---
tags: [status/stub, status/needswork/wip, status/mike, place]
---
    

but if I wrote up what I know, I'd just change to [place] as it was just a waypoint and you could steal if if say you needed a place for a forester to be from in southern Sembara easily enough.


[9/21/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
and finally, Fin Merriweather, a halfling I made up, is just 

---
tags: [status/stub, status/needswork/internal, person]
species: halfling
---

because I dropped a %% on the page with everything I know about him. In theory, if you wanted to rewrite the page you could.


[9/21/2024 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
One other thought... I think for PC pages there is no point in status tags like "needs work". The pc tag should be an indiciation that this page is "special" so if the page has a header and 1-2 sentences I'm going to just delete status

[9/21/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
on separate topic - do you have any notes on how the traveler is depicted?


[9/21/2024 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
the wanderer you mean?


[9/21/2024 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
yse wanderer


[9/21/2024 5:06 PM] rsulfuratus
this is what the note says but not sure it is up to date: "The Wanderer is usually depicted as a young man, dressed as a traveler or a merchant, in a cloak, with a walking staff or a scale."


[9/21/2024 5:13 PM] .deciusmus
One sec. Z is having a friend over for a sleepover and he just arrived


[9/21/2024 5:24 PM] .deciusmus
Despite having a player who is a paladin of the Wanderer the specific visual aesthic hasn't come up much. I think the above is basically about right, although I suspect some depictions might focus on the charitible side of him


[9/21/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not 100% sure what would be though; in my game the focus has very much been on the "charity/outcasts"


[9/22/2024 9:22 AM] rsulfuratus
you did a lot yesterday, just pulled the changes. mostly need to finish colorado prep and do a bit of work work today but might do a bit of tag updating and note cleanup in between other tasks, especially sorting status/tim things.

one thing to check - you didn't add anything about status/cleanup to the status doc, is this useful to keep? this is where i've stuck things that need various bits of metadata cleanup as opposed to text, and i see you also added status/cleanup/map to mostreve hills. 

might also be a decent tag to use for status/cleanup/image.

maybe change from status/cleanup to status/metadata? 

so then you'd have status/metadata (header, refactor, image, map)

and move what is currently status/cleanup/reformat into status/needswork/reformat


[9/22/2024 9:26 AM] .deciusmus
I like status/cleanup for basically "this note is accurate, use it as canon, but it could be improved"


[9/22/2024 9:26 AM] rsulfuratus
right, yeah. i guess i'm wondering if it is useful to have a separate "this note could use better metadata (header, image, map)"


[9/22/2024 9:28 AM] rsulfuratus
right now cleanup has ~60 notes that are missing header information, 15 that have various complex metadata cleanup (usually items that are specific examples of a common item that aren't well captured in current metadata), and 11 that are basically true cleanup (text is accurate but organization is outdated)


[9/22/2024 9:31 AM] rsulfuratus
my temptation is to move things as follows:
- status/cleanup (header, map, refactor) -> status/metadata (header, map, refactor)
- status/cleanup/reformat -> status/needswork/internal
- status/image -> status/metadata/image


[9/22/2024 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
I think it’s useful to distinguish between 
(A) metadata cleanup
(B) rethink/rework because it isn’t accurate / contents are not right
(C) rewrite because I.e it is very focused on a specific campaign but the contents are fine


[9/22/2024 10:42 AM] .deciusmus
I think in theory needswork/internal could be used for (c) as long as there is a %% saying ie %could use language cleanup, but complete%%


[9/22/2024 10:43 AM] rsulfuratus
maybe it is useful to have a separate needswork/rewrite. just thinking in terms of how i use status tags, there is a distsinction between collating information and polishing text and sometimes i just want to polish text


[9/22/2024 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
My goal was to be able to distinguish between 5 types of “needswork”:
- text polishing and writing/improving where all info is on the page itself
- text polishing and writing/improving where all info is in obsidian but needs digging or alignment (ie make sure such and such ruler page aligns with timeline)
- info is scattered between discord/email/obisidian but all shared
- info is not in a shared source but exists on paper somewhere 
- info is not in a shared source (usually implying it was used in game/somewhat canonical) and one of us has clear ideas but nothing written (usually implying more brainstorming/future game)


[9/22/2024 10:46 AM] .deciusmus
And then I think there are two other categories:
- complex page that really needs a discussion
- blank slate


[9/22/2024 10:46 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think those are great categories


[9/22/2024 10:47 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe we need 1 or 2 more tags to cover?


[9/22/2024 10:47 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/22/2024 10:48 AM] .deciusmus
I think something like:
- rewrite
- internal
- shared
- external
- wip


[9/22/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
Basically adds shared for external shared and repurposes rewrite for anything where the page itself is complete but not in fully satisfactory form


[9/22/2024 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
yeah I think that works. so what I have as cleanup/reformat should go to needswork/rewrite, and we should split current external to pull the things with notes in discord etc to shared instead of external


[9/22/2024 10:49 AM] .deciusmus
Yeah


[9/22/2024 10:50 AM] rsulfuratus
okay, i'm going to push a few changes then that reorg tags like this and add the status/metadata for things like header, image, map

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 10:50 AM] .deciusmus
Btw Z and his friends are starting a new 2024 campaign today and then ended up with bard/warlock/rogue/monk


[9/22/2024 10:51 AM] rsulfuratus
that is kind of funny


[9/22/2024 11:18 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed tag reorg


[9/22/2024 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
there is still one lingering issue imo, which is that there are still a lot of pages that have no status tag and yet might be properly tagged status/active, status/update, or something else like that. which is not really an issue from the point of view of "is the information in this page canonical" but can be an issue for avoiding branching realities if multiple campaigns cover the same ground


[9/22/2024 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus
(e.g., if your players go to Tollen or Addermarch; my addermarch game goes to southern Sembara; Dunmar Frontier goes to Aurbez)


[9/22/2024 11:27 AM] rsulfuratus
in particular, e.g. looking at Tollen, there are a lot of things that are reasonably complete, in that there isn't any additional information invented, but where i have a kind of vibes based sense of the place that isn't fully captured in the notes


[9/22/2024 11:31 AM] rsulfuratus
it is probably actually less relevant for dunmar places, because e.g. if your game is going to tollen you'd be well-aware that a lot happened in the dunmar game there (and session notes are pretty detailed for dunmar so you can see all the backlinks).

but for e.g. the cleeanseau game, it isn't really obvious to me what parts of tyrwingha are actually complete and what parts are complete but missing crucial vibes details that are important to keep in mind if creating new stuff


[9/22/2024 11:40 AM] rsulfuratus
but maybe this is not something that a tag system is good for and maybe not worth really worrying about. although part of me things there should be a status/complete tag for things where truly everything that is in anyone's head about the note is completely captured in the note text, these can get stale fast if someone forgets to change status/complete to status/update


[9/22/2024 11:40 AM] .deciusmus
(more in a bit, about to start Z's game)


[9/22/2024 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
(They also all have 8 STR, hahaha)


[9/22/2024 3:42 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder about a separate status frontmatter item with values like:

Complete 
Active
Blankslate
Owned
Complex

Where the idea is this in particular can be used to set
(A) owned; meaning one of us has a clear sense of this thing/place/whatever that isn’t captured on the page and best to check before making up stuff
(B) active; meaning this person or location is pretty active in an ongoing game, so page is likely a little stale


[9/22/2024 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
I’m not at my computer was going to look at what you did and some sample pages in a bit. But the intuition here is that what type of work a page needs and it’s “canon stuff” might be a little different


[9/22/2024 3:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i got sucked into tryign to solve a work problem so haven't done that much beyond the initial tag rework, but might do a bit in the next hour (although really should do colorado prep)

but yeah, perhaps the "how easy is this to use in a game" and "how complete is the information" are a bit orthogonal


[9/22/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
from the "use in a game perspective", i think there are really four-ish things. 

- some things are just background detail, exist as mostly a name with perhaps a bit of backstory, but are free to be iterated without complication
- some things might have had significant impact on a campaign, but all the necessary information (including vibes) is captured in some fashion in the note, and the creator doesn't have ongoing plans (or if they do have ongoing plans they are outlined), so this is something that can be iterated
- some things could be iterated/expanded, but there are key missing details (which might be semi-canonical stuff, role playing notes, vibes-based details, or similar) that would make it difficult to expand without further details 
- some things are central to a campaign in a way that makes it difficult for someone else to reuse without extensive discussion


[9/22/2024 3:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but also I think there is a bit of a challenge, like for example say my question about visual depications of the wanderer. mos numena gods are obviously not in category 4 above, or even 3, but there is just a limitation of how much notes get updated accurately after a campaign


[9/22/2024 3:54 PM] rsulfuratus
so there could be something like "this thing comes up a lot; the details are probably fine and this isn't an 'owned' page but maybe if you are curious about something it may have come up in x campaign'


[9/22/2024 3:55 PM] rsulfuratus
this often comes up for me because prepping for level 15 is a lot more time consuming for than for lower levels and i'm often hoping that you've invented some ancillary detail and just forgot to update the note


[9/22/2024 3:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i can usually guess in some cases just from knowing enough about your game, but if we are adding a status frontmatter then somethig like that might be a useful additional category


[9/22/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, some examples:
- Ravignac is cat 1, just a background place. a name I invented to drop in conversation in Addermarch game
- something like Escobar Garavito (dyer's guild scholarship student in Tollen) could easily be cat 2 with a bit of work, there is a big secret note that is largely background and role playing vibes but really doesn't need to be secret at this point. or, perhaps of more relevance, Caerlynn is roughly in the same boat.
- something like Torvaine Watch is cat 3, this was the location of the first adventure for addermarch game, but there is no reason it couldn't be iterated/expanded once I get notes in it (Tollen maybe here as well)
- something like the ruins of Isingue would be cat 4; really until the Dunmar campaign goes there and deals with the ooze it probably shouldn't feature in any other campaign


[9/22/2024 4:02 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure this is really that helpful


[9/22/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
I’m about to go shopping but I’ll take a look more in a bit.


[9/22/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I am updating status/tim notes and kind of dismayed at having the first ~2.5 years of dunmar frontier notes, plus all great library notes, in OneNote


[9/22/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
A couple of random thoughts...
(a) I think there is an extent to which different games are just inevitably going to be slightly different, i.e. if my game goes to Tollen at some point (likely) I think some characterizations will end up being just a little different and I don't think that matters at all. 
(b) I think one of the challenges with here is that there are couple of different things we are trying to do with status tagging.


[9/22/2024 4:46 PM] .deciusmus
In particular, there are intersecting quesitons of
(a) is the note "good" (i.e. clear writing, complete metadata, consistent with other notes)
(b) is the note "done" (i.e. does it capture everything that has been made up about this thing)
(c) is the note "available" (i.e. does it represent something that one of us is planning on using/inventing more of/etc)


[9/22/2024 4:46 PM] rsulfuratus
side note: is your intention that, e.g., Chardonian Legion should be [organization, status/needswork/wip, status/tim] to indicate that I am the one who has ideas in my head, or should I, having confirmed it is correctly tagged status/wip, delete the status/tim?


[9/22/2024 4:47 PM] .deciusmus
My original intention was the first one, although I think for a lot of things it is probably obvious who "owns it"


[9/22/2024 4:48 PM] .deciusmus
To go back to my list, I think a lot of the confusion here is really about the sublte grey areas between (b) and (c)

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 4:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I think if it is necessary to tag who "owns" something that should either be status/needswork/wip-person or wip/person, or indicated in comments. i prefer status/tim to just be things that need to be checked not long-term updates

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 4:49 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah. maybe status/needswork/wip-tim if you think it needs that level of clarity


[9/22/2024 4:50 PM] .deciusmus
And to add, there are layers and layers. So to go back to Caelynn. The page is pretty good and is certainly complete enough for me to use for rumors and such. And probably complete enough to run a side encounter with her, even, where the details can be a little vague.

But it wouldn't be complete enough for me to use her as say a major NPC


[9/22/2024 4:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right - but there is no reason you couldn't if I added the rest of my notes (which, mostly, are secrets on that page)


[9/22/2024 4:51 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/22/2024 4:51 PM] .deciusmus
But one thing our system doesn't capture very well right now is the difference between:


[9/22/2024 4:52 PM] .deciusmus
(a) I have more notes about this page even though this looks fairly complete vs
(b) I don't have more written notes, but I have a bunch of ideas about what I was thinking about when I invented this page that I used in game vs
(c) I don't have any specific ideas, but I am attached to this page  or intend to at some point make up more about this page, so run stuff by me before using


[9/22/2024 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
For example Cedric Cyfenwid is a paladin of the wyrdling, now dead, that I just tossed off as a potential background story hook. I don't have any real ideas about who he was, but he was originally built to be a hook for one of my pcs. that doesn't mean I'd be against you stealing him for some adventure in Addermarch (his tomb is sacred to the fey, say, and has some connection to ... whatever). But because I originally had some vague plans for him, I'd probably want you to run your invention by me before using it


[9/22/2024 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
But I think our existing status tags don't really capture that very well. And it is useful to be able to distinguish between say Cedric and Oswald Greensborn, a leader of the rangers who I just invented as a name in an old document, who is wide open for whatever uses


[9/22/2024 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so here is one idea. 

status tags should only concern whether the text of the page captures (in a clear, usable way) all in-game knowledge of the thing. they are really from the perspective of an in-world encylopedia or something. if something doesn't have a status tag, that should imply there are no factual details that are missing. 

separately, we need another tag to indicate kind of levels of ownership, which more has to do with either future ideas, or perhaps DM-facing information that wouldn't really make sense to include in a note. 

not sure what the keywords would be, or how to implement with a big backload tagging burden

but i agree it would be nice to have, basically:
- this page is has all the information i have and you are free to use it however you want
- this pages does not have all the information i have, but you are free to use it however you want (with the idea that this would trigger an ask, I want to send my party to Eskbridge, can you add any detail that is missing?)
- this page needs discussion if you want to use the thing


[9/22/2024 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., currently looking at Kharsan, which is actually fairly complicated:
- from the point of view of a generic reference, it is probably done, although I have some more details in OneNote that would be better to capture just to not waste/lose interesting details (such as the names and descriptions of all the Samraat Tombs)
- from the point of view of running a session in the ruins, it is not complete, because I have things like a rough map, that would be very useful if for example for some reason your players decided to go there, if only to save you some time
- but as far as I'm concerned with Grash dead the Dunmar campaign is done with it, so it is available to use


[9/22/2024 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right with of course in that case the added wrinkle that if my PCs went there it would be from before Grash's time.


[9/22/2024 5:09 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, but the map is the same, etc. most of the details don't really concern Grash specifically


[9/22/2024 5:09 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/22/2024 5:10 PM] rsulfuratus
like, I have no idea why I made this up, but I have this:

[9/22/2024 5:10 PM] rsulfuratus
re: the Samraat Tombs


[9/22/2024 5:11 PM] .deciusmus
It's a good example to think about... It seems to me that there is a key distinction between:
* There are *important* details missing
* There are *color* details missing but realistically if someone made up spur of the moment color details that ended up conflicting it probably doesn't matter


[9/22/2024 5:12 PM] .deciusmus
And there is also a sense of how much you care


[9/22/2024 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so in this example re: the Samraat Tombs - the only canonical detail that matters is the names and dates of the 12 Aatmaji samraats, plus a few details about Dasa (the last one) who tried to invade Drankor


[9/22/2024 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
so if your party went to Kharsan, as long as you had the names of the Samraats, the color details wouldn't matter, and none of the color details are canon anyway, since the Dunmar campaign never explored any of the tombs


[9/22/2024 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but, if you had similar color details about, say the Barony of Broomecliff, I'd certainly want to be aware, because if the Addermarch game goes there it would save me a lot of time


[9/22/2024 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right.


[9/22/2024 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
it is basically a tag that says, either, "I have DM notes that have important canon", vs "I have DM notes that you might find useful"


[9/22/2024 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
Right. That's a good way of saying it


[9/22/2024 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
And then I think separately, "I have plans for this" vs "I don't have plans for this"


[9/22/2024 5:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, I think that is the most useful set of distinctions.


[9/22/2024 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
So for example, two villages in Aveil:

Maudorville. The page is just a raw dump of rough notes I made up during session prep. But this was just a jumping off point to get an adventure hook. I neither care about it particularly nor have plans for it nor have any other details


[9/22/2024 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
So the page itself is in rough shape (its just raw notes). But in theory you could rewrite it based on those notes, adding whatever color you wanted, and that could be canon


[9/22/2024 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
Peydon. This page is not somewhere my PCs have gone and it reads pretty completely, with a "DM" note about a hag that controlled it for a while and a link to the in-game story I shared with my PCs about the hag


[9/22/2024 5:19 PM] .deciusmus
But I wouldn't want you to use it, because I don't know if my players will go there. I made it up as a hook and they might try to defeat the hag. Or they might just have other things to do and end up not going there. That said, you could certainly have a character in Addermarch have left Peydon during the time the hag was there, say, if you needed someone from far away with experience of a hag.


[9/22/2024 5:20 PM] .deciusmus
So there is a difference between "preserve someone else's narative space around this thing, but use on the fringes" vs "you don't have to preserve narrative space"


[9/22/2024 5:20 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the canon vs color distinction captures that fairly well though


[9/22/2024 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
although canon is not quite the right word.


[9/22/2024 5:21 PM] rsulfuratus
important details vs color details maybe


[9/22/2024 5:21 PM] .deciusmus
Is it worth distinguishing between "writing down" vs "in my head" vs "to be made up in the future"


[9/22/2024 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea being a page with either "DM notes exist, contain important information" or "I have plans for this" (regardless of existence or not of DM notes) triggers -> discuss before using


[9/22/2024 5:22 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. for Peyden, I have important details that are going to be made up in the future.


[9/22/2024 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i would think of it as two separate orthogonal things:
DM notes: none, color, important
Plans: yes, no


[9/22/2024 5:23 PM] .deciusmus
Ah


[9/22/2024 5:23 PM] .deciusmus
that seems sensible. If perhaps a bit of a pain to go and add to 500 notes


[9/22/2024 5:23 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah the question is how to implement something like this with minimal work


[9/22/2024 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
especially as I have a lot of stuff that has OneNote DM notes but that I don't have future plans for


[9/22/2024 5:24 PM] rsulfuratus
so anything based on e.g. internal backlinks to unshared notes doesn't help that much


[9/22/2024 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
It is probably more important for Addermarch/Sembara stuff than dunmari frontier though


[9/22/2024 5:25 PM] .deciusmus
because that's where direct sharing is more likely


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
right, that's true, and you are also more likely to have a good sense of whether a place was crucial to the dunmar campaign


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
And I can guess  a fair bit based on secret notes as well


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] rsulfuratus
true although sometimes I just put in blank secrets to mislead you


[9/22/2024 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. an NPC that was introduced "recently" (i.e. since we cut over to Obsidian) without a %%SECRET%% is almost certainly not important


[9/22/2024 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that is true


[9/22/2024 5:27 PM] rsulfuratus
(assuming there is anything on the page, sometimes I make stubs before copying stuff)


[9/22/2024 5:27 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I was just for example looking through Tollen humans and there is actually a secret tag on almost all of them


[9/22/2024 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
many of those are just my notes for how to roleplay the person, which doesn't really need to be secret anymore but I didn't want to just push directly before you met them


[9/22/2024 5:28 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I assumed


[9/22/2024 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but in some cases there might be actual secrets


[9/22/2024 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
and it can be a bit of work to disentangle, so it would be a lot faster for me to tag those all as "dm notes / color" or "dm notes / important" than actually disentangle


[9/22/2024 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
then if you want to use someone I can do the work


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
So what if we said, going forward:

dm_notes: none | color | important 
dm_plans: yes | no

Then status tagging is just for "encyclopedia" style reference.


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
is it better as front matter or tags?


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
I think front matter


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] rsulfuratus
okay


[9/22/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure


[9/22/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
easy to programmatically convert if desired later


[9/22/2024 5:33 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/22/2024 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
as far as dealing with notes that don't have that frontmatter set, I'd propose:

(1) for anything with a status tag, assume plans or DM notes might exist. tag status/(relevant person) if you update to remove status tag with a note %% set dm/plans info %%
(2) for anything without a status tag that is in greater sembara, assume plans: yes and notes: important until confirmed
(3) for anything outside greater sembara, not likely to come up, but I will try to set frontmatter for all the "complete" pages when I have time


[9/22/2024 5:34 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not sure what to do with pages outside gazetteer, people, groups though


[9/22/2024 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
as an example: for a while I had a lot of notes about dwarven religious practice that were relevant to the baharazel page but only existed as dm notes. 

i guess in this case status tags are probably more useful though?


[9/22/2024 5:38 PM] .deciusmus
So the idea is that you could have a couple of different types of pages:

* No status tag; dm_notes: color or important. The page is complete as it is, but there is another level of detail in dm notes (which could just be "dm head" notes doesn't  have to be written). If the notes are important, probably need to check before going to / meeting person.
* No status tag; dm_notes: none; nothing else exists

Then 
* status/needswork/rewrite - all the info is on the page, but it isn't in shape to publish
* status/needswork/internal - all the info is in obsidian, but isn't in shape to publish
* status/needswork/external - the info is in discord/email, but isn't in shape to publish
* status/needswork/wip - the info is only in DM notes, page can't really be used at all other than as a name; once it is in a usable state swap to no status tag and dm_notes:


[9/22/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
I would say that Worldbuilding, Species, and Cosmology is "special"


[9/22/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
and that we are just going to have to use judgement on those, and status tagging might not serve a ton of use


[9/22/2024 5:39 PM] .deciusmus
Things and Time the above should be ok on


[9/22/2024 5:40 PM] .deciusmus
+ History to "special" + Events ot "use the tags"


[9/22/2024 5:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure I understand when you tag someone? If I update say some random village in Aveil to set dm_notes and dm_plans am I supposed to tag you?


[9/22/2024 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
i think my idea is if you remove a status tag from something that isn't "your" page, e.g. because the status tag was just collating or rewriting, you should tag the other person


[9/22/2024 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
ah ,ok


[9/22/2024 5:44 PM] rsulfuratus
if you remove a status tag from your page, you should set dm_notes and dm_plans


[9/22/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
So this feels like it would work well. I'm going though People/Sembarans just to set tags


[9/22/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
dm_notes: none | color | important
dm_plans: no | yes

right?


[9/22/2024 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/22/2024 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
What do you think of using "wip" to basically mean: "there is no meaningful information except in DM notes; I need to copy over before you could really use this page"

vs "external" to mean: the info is in a _shared_ external place


[9/22/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
vs "no status tag" + dm_notes: color | important to mean "this page is good enough for some purposes, but I have more DM notes"


[9/22/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
most of the things tagged external are actually not shared as it is largely my onenote library


[9/22/2024 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i think status/needswork/shared is fine


[9/22/2024 5:47 PM] .deciusmus
yes, but is that still useful to you?


[9/22/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
I think my point is that we should be trying to distinguish between "the page is useable but dm notes has more info" vs "the page isn't useable"


[9/22/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
yes it is very useful to me because I don't have OneNote on my work computer so if I'm updating notes when I'm supposed to be working I can't work on anything with status/needswork/external


[9/22/2024 5:48 PM] .deciusmus
right ok


[9/22/2024 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but I do have discord and email so status/needswork/shared is fine


[9/22/2024 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
i think something with status/needswork/external should always *also* have a dm_notes and dm_plans tag


[9/22/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
See.. I want to be able to distinguish between "basic" and "detailed" info


[9/22/2024 5:50 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. take Airion (a random page with status/needswork/external)


[9/22/2024 5:50 PM] rsulfuratus
that would be dm_notes: important dm_plans: yes


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
right but also I think that the contents in obsidian right now are sufficient for some purposes


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but actually that is a little tricky because the dm_plans only exist if isaac's great library campaign gets to high level


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, maybe not. It depends on how important the "important" dm notes are


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, I see


[9/22/2024 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
Amberglow is a better example


[9/22/2024 5:52 PM] rsulfuratus
actually Airion is a good example, in that there is enough information that if you needed an author for a book of lore about the plane of fire for your party to find, Airion's Tome of Fire (or whatever) would be perfect


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
That's what I was going for


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] rsulfuratus
but if your players then decide to go researching "who was Airion" you need more information


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[9/22/2024 5:53 PM] .deciusmus
But if for example, he actually wasn't real at all, I need to know that as well before making him the author of a book


[9/22/2024 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
right, exactly. you want some sense of "how much can I use the information on this page at face value"


[9/22/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
So there is a difference between "yes, what is on the page is solid/canonical/usable" but there are DM notes that are important vs "no, what on the page is not solid/canonical/usable"


[9/22/2024 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
That's I think the difference between "needswork" and "cleanup"


[9/22/2024 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm, yeah.


[9/22/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe just separately status/needswork from status/cleanup makes sense then


[9/22/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
there are only 380 pages with status/needswork it would be pretty fast to move the ones that are correct but incomplete to cleanup


[9/22/2024 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
with the same categories


[9/22/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
so cleanup means "nothing on the page is wrong but there are more details"


[9/22/2024 5:58 PM] rsulfuratus
and I think crucially means "the extra details don't complicate the page"


[9/22/2024 5:58 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 5:59 PM] rsulfuratus
so for example for Airion, if there is something about him that is  atypical for a stereotypical " powerful mage with connections to elemental planes" - say, he was illiterate somehow - that would need to be noted for status/cleanup to be appropriate


[9/22/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
that seems exactly correct


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
alternatively, take Alaric Benec, the Lord Mayor of Rinburg


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
I have no plans for him, and only color info


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
But the page is entirely blank other than a header


[9/22/2024 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
so because nothing is written, I'm writing status/needswork/wip, dm_notes: color, dm_plans: no

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
if I write enough color that he'd be vaguely useable, I'd get rid of status/needswork and leave dm_notes" color
If I write up all the color I made up for him, then I also change dm_notes to none


[9/22/2024 6:02 PM] .deciusmus
If my color was written done in my internal DM folder, or some email to me players, I would potentially set needswork/external rather than needswork/wip

if on the other hand the color was in a discord chat with you, I'd set needswork/shared. If the ONLY meaningful color was in a chat with you, I'd set needswork/shared, dm_notes: none


[9/22/2024 6:04 PM] rsulfuratus
so generally then I think the implication is:

- if there are status tags besides status/cleanup or status/metadata, the page is likely not usable in current form
- if there are no status tags, or just status/cleanup or status/metadata tags, and

(a) dm_notes: color, the page is usable but someone else might have useful details to save time. 
(b) dm_notes: none, the page is usable and you are on your own
(c) dm_notes: important, the page is not usable for anything other than minor background without discussion

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus
If all the color was in some letter that I wrote up for my players, I would set dm_notes: none, needswork/internal and add a %% like

%% see [[ letter about alaric ]] for color info %%


[9/22/2024 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
(this all assumes dm_plans: no, if dm_plans: yes then should always check, I think)

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
The other implication (should be) that if 
(a) dm_notes: none
(b) status of status/needswork/internal or status/needswork/shared

Then you are on your own, but if you want to do the splunking in discord/obsidian go for it

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
(again assuming dm_plans: no)


[9/22/2024 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess the only complication is what if we both have plans? mostly involves Feywild, e.g. Amberglow / Duskmire and related places


[9/22/2024 6:06 PM] .deciusmus
I think those pages are pretty clear, right? The implication of anyone having plans is to discuss the details, right? so does it matter?


[9/22/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I guess it doesn't matter


[9/22/2024 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
ideally for pages like that we should try to make sure that all information is captured in the note itself, in the style of the duskmire page which has comments with canon from addermarch and cleenseau


[9/22/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
yeha


[9/22/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
I think in shared pages it is just more important to try to avoid dm_note: importnat


[9/22/2024 6:08 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[9/22/2024 6:08 PM] .deciusmus
and in general, the world is pretty proscribed as well... Dunmar Frontier kinda has "first dibs" on secrets


[9/22/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
so it is fairly obvious where there is significant overlap


[9/22/2024 6:09 PM] .deciusmus
in what might be dm plans, and I think it is a small enough space that it is easy to work out


[9/22/2024 6:10 PM] .deciusmus
if you say, ran a new campaign in Tollen once Dunmari frontier is over it gets more complicated but we can cross that bridge when we come to it


[9/22/2024 6:10 PM] rsulfuratus
right, yes


[9/22/2024 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i have to go make dinner but i am going to try to push a bunch of status moves (from needswork -> cleanup where appropriate) and add dm notes


[9/22/2024 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
later tonight


[9/22/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
k


[9/22/2024 6:11 PM] .deciusmus
I also have to go make dinner, but dana doesn't get home til 11 so might / likely will do more as well


[9/22/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
I'm working on Sembarans & Aveil folders to start


[9/22/2024 6:12 PM] .deciusmus
but i will try to push frequently to avoid conflicts


[9/22/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
A few notes as I do this... 

status/update is another tag that doesn't mean the page is unusable per se; I am using the dm_notes to track how important the update is.

(i.e. a character who has had significant event happen might get status/update, dm_notes: important)

It's really much easier than other status attempts we've done. I might be slightly overtagged dm_notes: color but it is a good shorthand way to basically say: "I have thoughts about this person that might not be here"


[9/22/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm adding dm_notes / dm_plans at the very bottom of metadata, so it is easy to see


[9/22/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
at some point I might update the header JS to flag on the page body somehow


[9/22/2024 6:51 PM] rsulfuratus
here is a slightly complicated one. 

Sir Einrik Arpaad was the commander of Torvaine Watch, was possessed by a cursed dagger, killed the soldiers in the watch, and became a ghost. Deciphering mystery was first addermarch adventure. i have a bunch of notes about the ghost, the cursed dagger, and such that I haven't put in the main note. 

but i have no future plans and if your party ever went to addermarch prior to the events of the addermarch campaign how he eventually dies doesn't matter

would you tag that as dm_notes: color or dm_notes: none or dm_notes: important?


[9/22/2024 6:52 PM] .deciusmus
I'd tag as color and then add something like
%% Become a ghost in one of the early Addermarch adevntures %%


[9/22/2024 6:52 PM] rsulfuratus
great, that is exactly what I did


[9/22/2024 6:53 PM] .deciusmus
I had a complicated one as well..

Duncan Rivers is an innkeeper in Cleenseau. I have no plans to do anything with him per se, but the ale  barrels in his basement were being drunk by a somewhat surly fairy. My PCs never figured out the details, and might still go investigate.

dm_plans: yes ? or no?


[9/22/2024 6:55 PM] rsulfuratus
probably would be dm_plans: no on Duncan Rivers. dm_plans: yes on the note for the inn, if it exists. 

dm_plans: yes on Duncan if the inn doesn't have a page


[9/22/2024 6:55 PM] .deciusmus
right, that makes sense


[9/22/2024 6:56 PM] .deciusmus
here's another one. Is it reasonable to assume someone would check the family page?

I have a npc, Jean-Luc d'Aslain, who is minor but I have some important details about the d'Aslain family in DM notes


[9/22/2024 6:56 PM] .deciusmus
Is dm_notes: important on the d'Aslain page good enough?


[9/22/2024 6:57 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, i think reasonable to assume linked pages get checked


[9/22/2024 6:57 PM] rsulfuratus
if both d'Aslain and Jean-Luc d'Aslain are tagged dm_notes: important I'd assume you have some specific to Jean-Luc in your notes

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 7:00 PM] .deciusmus
So I have:

Jean-Luc d'Aslain 
no status tag, dm_notes: color, dm_plans: no

d'Aslain family
body of page is just
A longstanding noble family in the Barony of Aveil with an ancient history. One of the wealthiest families in the [[Auberonne]] river valley.

dm_notes: important
dm_plans: yes


[9/22/2024 7:01 PM] .deciusmus
My intention is that jean-luc is minor character, but my pcs have met him a few times and I haven't detailed the color interactions.

the dAslain family on the other hand has some complex behind the scenes stuff going on, but the basic sentence above is totally correct


[9/22/2024 7:06 PM] rsulfuratus
so another linked thing - Einrik, mentioned above, was possessed by a cursed dagger. while the details of Einrik's story aren't important, the cursed dagger might be. 

Einrik -> status/cleanup/external, dm_notes: color, dm_plans: no
Dagger -> status/needswork/wip, dm_notes: important, dm_plans: yes

is that clear what the intention is?


[9/22/2024 7:06 PM] .deciusmus
i would assume using Einrik is fine, although to get color from you if my pcs were going to met them; but that the dagger is not useable in current state

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 7:07 PM] rsulfuratus
perfect


[9/22/2024 7:07 PM] .deciusmus
btw, I am finding the status/stub doesn't make a ton of sense anymore


[9/22/2024 7:08 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. a page that is dm_notes: none, dm_plans: no, where only the header is useful could just be status/cleanup/header


[9/22/2024 7:08 PM] rsulfuratus
what would you use then for, e.g. Buruli. current page content is just:

```
---
tags: [status/stub, person]
---
```


[9/22/2024 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
dm_plans: ??
dm_notes: important
status/needswork/wip


[9/22/2024 7:09 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm.


[9/22/2024 7:09 PM] .deciusmus
stub is maybe most useful actually to mean: I haven't set plans or notes yet


[9/22/2024 7:10 PM] .deciusmus
i.e. when you are creating a page quickly to make sure you get the spelling right across a couple of different other notes or from session notes or whatever, and don't even want to set the status flags


[9/22/2024 7:10 PM] .deciusmus
the problem is that without dm plans/notes, it is hard to know what status/stub means


[9/22/2024 7:10 PM] rsulfuratus
my workflow is pretty different from yours, I often go:
1. write session notes and bracket anything that should have a note
2. set status/stub and proper person/item etc to every created note
3. try to find time to go back and fill in more information


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I think status/stub should actually mean "no status info set yet" not "just needs a header"


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
my dm notes are typically organized by session, I don't usually pre-create notes


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, that makes sense


[9/22/2024 7:11 PM] .deciusmus
when you go back, you can switch to status/cleanup/header if that is all it needs

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 7:12 PM] .deciusmus
My workflow is usually..

make a list in the DM folder for session prep
if I make an image, create a page to hold the image in DM
if the PCs actually met the person, move page to People


[9/22/2024 7:13 PM] .deciusmus
but anyway, I think status/stub = no one has set the DM info and only the creator of the page should remove it


[9/22/2024 7:19 PM] rsulfuratus
here is another edge case. 

i have a few notes where the only missing information is whereabouts. there aren't any additional useful dm_notes and I have no plans, but their locations at certain times is canonical. 

inclination is just status/cleanup/header with a comment "%% canonical whereabouts between XX and YY not captured yet%% as it is a pretty rare edge case


[9/22/2024 8:05 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that seems reasonable.


[9/22/2024 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
here's another tricky one...

Lambert Talwrey. He's dead, but the PCs were invstigating his murder. Other than a convinent dead body, no details about him.

The details of the murderer, however, are complex.


[9/22/2024 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
is the murderer linked from the note? if yes i'm not sure how this is different from my Einrik / cursed dagger example


[9/22/2024 8:16 PM] .deciusmus
right, I guess its the same


[9/22/2024 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
the murderer was a fey changeling, but I thinked both the actual fey and the person she was changed into


[9/22/2024 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
*linked


[9/22/2024 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
here's another one I'm not sure on.

Remille Vauclaire. A ranger and low-ish level fighter. Originally from Adderfell. 

no real details or plans, but she is currently on the periphry of key events in Aveil in my game, so always a chance she somehow gets involved.

Just set dm_plans: yes? Or something else


[9/22/2024 8:39 PM] .deciusmus
(the whereabouts tracks her location accurately, but you'd have to know where my next couple of sessions are going to be to know she is nearby to them...)


[9/22/2024 8:39 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah probably just dm_plans: yes is sufficient there


[9/22/2024 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
did you make a page on the de Brune family


[9/22/2024 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
no


[9/22/2024 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
someone should


[9/22/2024 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
i am behind a lot addermarch stuff due to the complexity of prepping for level 15


[9/22/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
I made one

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
just a stub for now


[9/22/2024 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
for someone like Tristan, where there are lots of notes but all in shared email, but where I have plans:

status/needswork/shared
dm_notes: none
dm_plans: yes

right?


[9/22/2024 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[9/22/2024 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
ok i've finished all the sembaran people


[9/22/2024 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
and for someone like Marcel de Valarin, where I have
(a) nothing really written
(b) bullet notes in %% on the page
(c) plans

It would be:
status/needswork/internal
dm_notes: none
dm_plans: yes

right?


[9/22/2024 9:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i have something similar for Caradoc in Addermarch


[9/22/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
although if all the relevant information is on the page in note form, shouldn't it be status/cleanup/internal?


[9/22/2024 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
needswork/internal implies there is missing info in other notes that you need to collate

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 9:09 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, here is one.

Agon, Vola's mentor in Chardon. the note is complete except for secrets. tagged dm_notes: important and dm_plans: yes

does it need a status tag?


[9/22/2024 9:10 PM] .deciusmus
no


[9/22/2024 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
also: what is the difference between status/cleanup/header and status/metadata/header? 

is cleanup/header just a replacement for metadata/header?


[9/22/2024 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
that's your call 🙂


[9/22/2024 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
but yes, I think they are the same


[9/22/2024 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
dunno if metadata/header or cleanup/header is better


[9/22/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i think metadata/header is better
cleanup | needswork to me imply text editing

metadata/header, metadata/image, metadata/map is non-text editing

[9/22/2024 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
i am changing now


[9/22/2024 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed


[9/22/2024 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
here's one.. Avatus.

I dropped lots of hints about him in my Cleenseau game, but all as deep background/history and backstory for why there was a buried fort and/or various hobgoblin skeletons coming to life


[9/22/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
Ultimately whatever the "real" details it could have come down to 1720 garbled, so nothing I dropped necessarily has to be canonical


[9/22/2024 9:16 PM] .deciusmus
dm_notes: color?


[9/22/2024 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[9/22/2024 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
long dead fey:
People/Fey or People/historical figures ?


[9/22/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
i moved needswork/rewrite to cleanup and recategorized all the notes with that tag as either cleaup/internal or cleanup/external

cleanup/internal implies you can fix the page just by what is on the page
cleanup/external implies color details or other non-crucial information might need to be collated from other sources

example: Cavarrio's Chronicles of Drankor needs to be rewritten into a proper source, as it is supposed to represent an in-world book. i have a few notes about possible errors in Cavarrio's work but nothing canonical (otherwise would be: dm_notes: important). but, if anyone wants to do this, it requires at least collating with the "correct" Drankorian history and so is a bit more complex than, e.g., the similar "Story about Hags" which just needs a quick Taelgarification


[9/22/2024 9:21 PM] rsulfuratus
does that make sense?


[9/22/2024 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/22/2024 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
similar: 

Marcella is [person, status/needswork/external, status/metadata/header, status/cleanup/internal] with a note 
%% need to fix whereabouts, campaign info, away dates %%
%% fix text to change session links %%

the implication is supposed to be than anyone could rewrite the text to remove "Felt forced to try to steal from party in [[Session 44 (DuFr)]]," into a dufr campaign block. 

but also tagged status/needswork/external to indicate there is important information not captured


[9/22/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure that is super clear but also not sure it really matters?


[9/22/2024 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
right i mean i'm the only one who is likely to be working on marcella's note


[9/22/2024 9:25 PM] .deciusmus
what's the right tag for "factually accurate but feels a like sparse"


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
although, re: marcella and similar, the reason to tag status/cleanup/internal is that theoretically it would be feasible for you to rewrite some of those pages (e.g., Marcella, Hektor, other NPCs you encountered) that currently have a lot of bare session note links into something a little cleaner


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
does that need a tag?


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
I guess not


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
re: marcella I think the main thing is that the external tag implies that the information on the page isn't really adequately complete


[9/22/2024 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
although if there is something that feels sparse that you know is a page I created, status/tim and a %% is reasonable


[9/22/2024 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
So i.e. a page wth
dm_notes: color
status/cleanup/internal

feels like, hey, a rewrite will be ok

status/needswork/external
implies that you can't trust the page


[9/22/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
ah i see so the combination of both tags is confusing


[9/22/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the proper tag for "information is correct but badly incomplete"


[9/22/2024 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
status/cleanup/external?


[9/22/2024 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
I think dm_notes: importat


[9/22/2024 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for marcella nothing is misleading or wrong about the text but 
(a) the header whereabouts are badly incomplete
(b) there are additional important details in my notes (dm_notes: important)
(c) the page itself needs a rewrite to both fix internal linking and incorporate external notes that give more crucial information


[9/22/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
I would call that status/metadata/header, status/cleanup/internal


[9/22/2024 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
dm_notes: important


[9/22/2024 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm. 

i feel like it is useful for me to have a tag that says "there is external information i need to copy to this page" that is distinct from "i have important dm notes"


[9/22/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
right, see I haven't been bothering with that


[9/22/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
I think status/cleanup/<whatever you want to use>


[9/22/2024 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
or just status/<whatever you want to use>


[9/22/2024 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
you could do something like status/onenote separate from the rest of the status tagging we are doing


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, so for you the crucial thing is:
needswork -> the page can't be used because the information is misleading, non-canon, so incomplete as to prevent meaningful use in a game
cleanup -> the page might not be complete in some abstract sense but it isn't missing any critical information


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
The main thing to me is that

(a) status/needswork means "don't trust the page"
(b) status/needswork/<internal|shared> means "but the way to fix it is in obsidian or shared email


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
anything else is less important to me


[9/22/2024 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
oh, and status/stub means "creator has to finish creating it"


[9/22/2024 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
right, okay. so i can use whatever status/cleanup subtags I want and you don't really care if they have meaning to you, as long as the "cleanup" / "needswork" distinction is maintained and "internal" / "shared" have consistent meaning


[9/22/2024 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
yes

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
It would be good to agree on a tag for "the page has all the details" as well (to distinguish from "obsidian has the details")


[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] .deciusmus
I think earlier we said status/cleanup/internal


[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
I am using internal for this


[9/22/2024 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
consistently across cleanup and needswork, where needswork/internal implies usually that obsidian has the details (as otherwise it would just be cleanup/internal)

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i think internal just means "in obsidian", shared means "discord/email", external means "something only the creator can access"

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 9:40 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think generally cleanup/internal should be reserved for "rewrite the page without external references"


[9/22/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
there are a few pages where we both might have dm notes.. i.e. the Rangers


[9/22/2024 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
I guess earlier we said we'd try to keep the notes in obsidian for those


[9/22/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think okay to see how things shake out a bit


[9/22/2024 9:41 PM] rsulfuratus
if we find there are tags that don't make sense or are unclear can just refactor easily with the tag manager in obsidian


[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
also we should try to check the needswork pages to clean up the ones that don't actually need work (in general, i would assume that if a page has a dm_notes/dm_plans frontmatter the status tag is correct, if not then maybe not)

{Reactions}
👍

[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
I've been fixing status tags as a I go


[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] .deciusmus
I aslos added a missing dm info page in MoC


[9/22/2024 9:43 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i saw


[9/22/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
I wonder if there is use in having something like a dm_notes: shared


[9/22/2024 9:44 PM] .deciusmus
for pages we know we are both going to be potentially referencing, i.e. Shattered Ice Clan, Rangers, some Feywild stuff


[9/22/2024 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean that should never really happen, if we both have dm_notes we should be doing it in  comments on the page, or in worldbuilding if particularly complex

a dm_plans: [clee, adm] might be useful though?


[9/22/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
dm_notes: color|important|none is a logical OR operation. if either of us have dm notes it gets set to the highest level


[9/22/2024 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
with the goal of eventually moving all DM notes to %% for shared things


[9/22/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but I guess if it is useful to track where that hasn't happened yet, dm_notes: shared could be good?


[9/22/2024 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
or if it useful to track places where there are multiple %% canon from XXX %% notes?


[9/22/2024 9:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but in some ways plans are better - e.g. if your PCs go to adderfell, setting dm_plans: [clee] and tagging status/tim is a good way to mark that I need to dump anything useful, but really discord is best for this


[9/22/2024 10:00 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[9/22/2024 10:01 PM] .deciusmus
probably lets stick with what we agreed and not overthink fo rnow


[9/22/2024 10:22 PM] .deciusmus
I'm stopping for the night: one last thought.

I'm using "needswork/shared" as a rough shorthand for pages that I created originally but where I have no particular information, but also where the info in obsidian is inadequate, i.e. the highland kingdoms


[9/22/2024 10:23 PM] .deciusmus
I also think that "PCs will go to a place at some point" is not a good reason for dm_plans: yes


[9/23/2024 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
Is it fair to say that any place with status/stub and a ~ name is fair to fixup and set dm_notes/dm_plans to no?


[9/23/2024 1:35 PM] .deciusmus
Also, is it fair to set status/cleanup/internal rather than status/needswork/internal when there is not much made up, but some of it is on well-organized backlinks rather than the page itself?


[9/23/2024 1:41 PM] rsulfuratus
I think status/cleanup/internal is reasonable for notes where most information is available but only through backlinks, yes


[9/23/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
For this, I guess with the exception of places that are not "clearly on the map"


[9/23/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
(I have a few minutes while I eat lunch, and I'm trying to reduce the number of status/stub so when I add new pages with status/stub it is easier to find them)


[9/23/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
re: status/stubs, I'm not sure that is entirely correct? i guess the concept of dm_plans for places is a little nebulous. but lots of status/stub pages i do actually have notes. e.g. Emerald Coast, Northern Boreal Forest, North Chardon Coast, Great Desert, Eastern Islands


[9/23/2024 1:45 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess setting them to status/needswork/<something> and dm_notes: no might be fine and accomplish the same thing


[9/23/2024 1:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess my point is there are plenty of place stubs that are in the "can't be used without more info" category


[9/23/2024 1:46 PM] .deciusmus
that's kinda what I mean by "clearly on the map"


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I guess I'm a little confused. the North Chardon Coast is clearly on the map, is it not?


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
but i have a fair bit of notes in a totally disorganized and not-necessarily-canon bunch of dm notes on the chardonian empire


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] .deciusmus
Yes, that is. 
Great Desert / Eastern Islands are not


[9/23/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so it isn't really "a place you can use" as if you wanted to send your players there I'd need to sort out what is color, what is important, etc


[9/23/2024 1:48 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I guess that's true. In that sense, leaving as stub is important actually


[9/23/2024 1:48 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure that "clearly on the map" is an accurate guide to whether a place stub has unincorporated dm information is all i'm saying


[9/23/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
if you need to get rid of my stubs you can tag things you don't know what to do with status/stub-tim or something


[9/23/2024 1:49 PM] rsulfuratus
or status/stub, status/tim and just exclude things with status/tim from your stub search


[9/23/2024 1:49 PM] .deciusmus
no, if you have a lot of places with unincorporated DM notes I won't bother


[9/23/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
I was vaguely assuming you didn't have a lot of notes about regions that were not in obsidian except for the "weird" places on the far edges of things


[9/23/2024 1:50 PM] .deciusmus
but I guess a lot of the places Great Library campaign went to you probably do have notes in OneNote or whatever


[9/23/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
the west coast is in kind of bad shape, it has (a) a bunch of great library stuff, and (b) a bunch of half made up notes when I thought you were going to go to Chardon and deal with Fausto directly before looking for the jade pieces  or on the way to the merfolk kelp


[9/23/2024 1:51 PM] rsulfuratus
and the whole chasa river valley / elderwood is all pre-obsidian so has a lot of stubs too


[9/23/2024 6:40 PM] .deciusmus
have you considered at all why werewolves turn during the full moon?


[9/23/2024 6:41 PM] .deciusmus
is it just that pandemonium is closer to taelgar? something else? just pondering in relationship to my PC who is dedicated to the moon


[9/23/2024 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
I wrote this as an intro during the werewolf arc but nothing beyond the implications here:

The world turns, night falls, and the stars begin to flicker in the sky over Dunmar. As the Fox and Hunter drift above the horizon, they watch the full moon rising for the 2,514th time, and listen. Their attention, as always, is drawn to the east, and north, where the prayers are the brightest and loudest, the hopes for safety, for healing, for peace that echo across the borderlands. They reach out, as they do every night, granting what minor miracles they can to the rangers who keep Sembara safe from the darkness of the Plague Lands.

The work is easy tonight. As the moon turns to full the tidal pull of the Divine Presence grows stronger, filling the land, and the Source is easy to reach. The Fox thinks of days running in the forests of the north, and stretches across the world. The Hunter calls to him, reminds him of the task ahead, but remembers the joy of those early days too, the thrill and power of just running in the deep forests where he met the Fox.

Their attention, though, does not stay on the forested Mostreve hills on the southern reaches of Sembara, nor the arid foothills where the people of the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez scratch out a living on the edge of the Plague Lands. The full moon also draws the darkness of the Void closer. The Hunter, always with one small part of his essence watching those who carry echoes of his companions of old, sees the madness pour into the soul of a poor innocent boy, a young dwarf not even of age, in west of Dunmar.

(cont)


[9/23/2024 7:04 PM] rsulfuratus
While the Fox tends to the prayers of the rangers of Sembara, the Hunter watches Dunmar more closely for a moment. Across the desert and dry arid plains -- so hard not to cast the land in his mind's eye as it was -- the People of the Horse are moving. Sura, the sister of the current Samraat, has returned from an unreachable prison, and many people are gathering in her camps. And yet she is not marching to war, not yet.

North of the city of Tokra, an old woman sits by the fire, wondering. The Hunter watches her a moment, sees the prayers streaming to Bhishma, asking when the strange travelers of her dreams will arrive, and how much should she tell them when they do? He senses the tangled future, but there is little he can do to shape that destiny.

In Tokra, the poor innocent is snarling, consumed with the madness of Jinnik on this night of power. The waves of the Void crash over him, each wave reaching higher and higher up the beach, threatening to overwhelm his soul, until suddenly there is calm, clear water and silver twilight in the forests. The Fox comes running -- is this my home? No, the Hunter says, just an echo of what was lost, but that echo still has power.

The tide madness recedes from the boy, but not from everywhere in this city. Elsewhere, the darkness of the Void is pulled tight, bound together with the souls of those who have submitted to its power. It will be harder to free these of the curse.


[9/24/2024 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
I’m mostly pretty busy with work today and tomorrow but I was playing around a bit more with DM notes and status tags, and I think we are still missing one categorization mechanism…


[9/24/2024 1:39 PM] .deciusmus
Specifically there are a handful of pages that are about either big “world level” things (Mos Numena, Elves) or major regional level things (Chardonian Empire, Sembara, Tyrwingha)


[9/24/2024 1:43 PM] .deciusmus
These pages are all characterized by the ability to have kinda endless spiraling detail (much of which isn’t relevant for a player facing webpage but is useful when making up new related things) and also a somewhat iterative approach to development and somewhat of a potential to be invented at some level even without a game reason


[9/24/2024 1:44 PM] .deciusmus
They are also the pages where “done” is the hardest to define as at some level they are never done


[9/24/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I think there are several separate things here:

(1) There is: does the note in question contain enough accurate information for me to run a [session, arc, one-shot, mini-series, campaign] there and usefully leverage existing lore? Or separately to use it as background color? 
(2) There is: is another DM actively working in this area, such that I should discuss if I am actively running something involving this note? 
(3) There is: does this note capture all the information that has been invented about this thing?
(4) There is: does this note have a level of detail that is appropriate to its centrality in the world? That is, is this a place that would benefit from invention because it seems thin at the moment?


[9/24/2024 3:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I think (1) is well-captured by status tags, primarily needswork but also active, update and dm_notes


[9/24/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
(2) is captured by dm_plans


[9/24/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
(3) is generally captured by status/cleanup and perhaps status/metadata


[9/24/2024 3:28 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not sure that (4) needs to be marked in any particular way?


[9/24/2024 3:32 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. the Sembara page is clearly not currently adequate to run a game in Sembara without relying on outside information, so it is correctly tagged status/needswork (probably should be more detail but I think there are both shared and external notes). but does it need a separate tag that says "this is world-relevant?"


[9/24/2024 3:33 PM] .deciusmus
So a good example is the Duchy of Maseau. 

The page right now is both (a) pretty thin and (b) not fully up to date some of the latest invention on Isingue and the hobgoblin wars. 

I have some background color that I’ve tossed out in both my Aussons mini series and current game but nothing really meaningful or that I care about being particularly canonical


[9/24/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
And I currently don’t have any plans to send my PCs there but it’s kinda lurking on the border of my game always a couple of random moments of invention away from at least being semi-relevant


[9/24/2024 3:34 PM] .deciusmus
So what’s the right status for the page?


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] .deciusmus
Or take sembara? What level of work is required to change from needswork to some other status tag? Is a 5-10 sentence summary (good enough for a game in Dunmar) enough?


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I think it needs work. it would be tough - possibly misleading - to try to do much invention there relying entirely on the details on the page itself, especially given more recent inventions in addermarch and southern sembara that directly impinge on Maseau


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
I would tag it status/needswork (shared/external/nothing depending)


[9/24/2024 3:37 PM] rsulfuratus
and also dm_notes: color and dm_plans: no


[9/24/2024 3:38 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe status/needswork/internal if it is just about refactoring based on details of hobgoblin history


[9/24/2024 3:39 PM] rsulfuratus
my mental test is "if I was going to run a low level one shot somewhere random in taelgar, do I feel like I could reasonably invent a small town and a nearby ruin that would not create contradictions"


[9/24/2024 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
personally I would keep Sembara as needswork until it reaches the level of detail of e.g. Dunmar which I think is a particularly complete note


[9/24/2024 3:41 PM] rsulfuratus
but if you would prefer finer granularity then perhaps a distinction between "wrong/bad don't use" and "incomplete" is what you are looking for?


[9/24/2024 3:43 PM] rsulfuratus
I also think addermarch is a good example - I basically invented everything I felt like I wanted to know to reliably be able to improvise history/ruins/towns in addermarch, and it is largely all in one place, the note in obsidian


[9/24/2024 3:44 PM] .deciusmus
Yes, I think that is most of it. I think there is a spiraling level of detail, i.e.

Good enough to toss out as color -> good enough to touch down for part of a session or be used as PC background -> good enough to run a few adventures -> good enough to run a campaign


[9/24/2024 3:49 PM] rsulfuratus
so i agree it would be useful to have that kind of information embedded in each note but i'm not sure what the tagging system would be, especially what it would be that wouldn't add a large refactorization workload


[9/24/2024 3:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but also isn't that kind of a judgement call that is hard to pin down?

that is, if we use status tags and DM notes to reliably track how much information exists about <thing x> that is not recorded on the <thing x> note, then if you are looking at a page that has no status tags or DM notes but is still not complete enough to run in, maybe you need to make some stuff up


[9/24/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
i feel like the important point of status tags is to be able to see "how much stuff is invented about this place already but is missing from the note"


[9/24/2024 3:52 PM] rsulfuratus
(but this elides the "is the stuff here wrong or just incomplete")


[9/24/2024 3:53 PM] .deciusmus
What is the right status tag for Ardlas? There is basically nothing invented about it, although we had a couple of discussions about highlander kingdom vibes, and there is a bit of deep history in worldbuilding documents about Ardlas


[9/24/2024 3:54 PM] .deciusmus
The other part of this for me at least is trying to reduce the # of items with status tags


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
So i.e. if I have a bit of time in the evening I might want to pick a few "status/needsworks" to clean up.


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
I was contemplating having something like a status/complex


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
for "world-level" pages


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
which would just be permanent


[9/24/2024 3:55 PM] .deciusmus
and then if I wanted to try to clean up some easy things you can do status/needswork and !status/complex


[9/24/2024 3:56 PM] .deciusmus
the other thing I was contemplating was the idea of dm_plans gets fuzzy for big world level pages....

for example, take Mind Flayers. I don't have any immediate plans for mind flayers, but I know I eventually want to use them as a major villian


[9/24/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I think for Ardlas, looking at the note now, I think:

(1) the main page needs to capture - at least, or perhaps preferably, as a comment - the flavor of the discussion about vibes
(2) it would be useful to review the wordbuilding stuff and pull a few minor details about who lives there
(3) it should have a minimal description of geography and bounaries to the extent the lines on the map are correct


[9/24/2024 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
that would capture everything that has been invented, and at that point i'd remove the needswork tag


[9/24/2024 3:58 PM] rsulfuratus
to me the absence of a status tag doesn't imply a page is done - nothing can ever be done, really - but that working on the page is going to be pure invention and not collating/copying/digging up old notes


[9/24/2024 3:59 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the purpose of status/complex for world level pages?


[9/24/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
re: dm_plans, I would prefer to be liberal with setting plans: yes than conservative


[9/24/2024 4:00 PM] rsulfuratus
I would definitely set dm_plans: yes on mind flayers


[9/24/2024 4:00 PM] .deciusmus
Right, maybe I am just overthinking this


[9/24/2024 4:01 PM] rsulfuratus
it does occasionally get a little tricky for me as there are some things I don't want to set plans for because I maybe don't want to ruin the surprise


[9/24/2024 4:01 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe the answer is just

(a) add a status/errors ideally with a comment to indicate a page that likely has misleading/wrong information
(b) be liberal with dm_plans: yes


[9/24/2024 4:02 PM] .deciusmus
status/errors being especially useful as a way to i.e. when rewriting some section of history, go and tag the backlinks without having to spend a lot of time on it


[9/24/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
but as an alterantive to (b) maybe it is worth having, for some more intristictally shared, pages, an
dm_owner: mike | tim | shared | open


[9/24/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah I like status/errors, although status/factcheck serves a similar role


[9/24/2024 4:03 PM] .deciusmus
right, maybe status/factcheck/minor status/factcheck/major as optional variants is good enough


[9/24/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
or just a generic status/check tag with subtags:
- minor

{Reactions}
👍

[9/24/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
- errors


[9/24/2024 4:03 PM] rsulfuratus
- name


[9/24/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
- mike


[9/24/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
- tim


[9/24/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
with the implication of dm_owner being less "I have active plans" as "i'm interested in this topic and have been thinking about it"


[9/24/2024 4:04 PM] .deciusmus
so don't go invent out of the blue


[9/24/2024 4:04 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the benefit to tagging that separately than dm_plans?


[9/24/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
to obscure whether you have active plans in dunmar or not


[9/24/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
ah okay


[9/24/2024 4:05 PM] rsulfuratus
that makes sense


[9/24/2024 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
and also specifically to allow you to tag dm_owner: open as stuff you actively don't have plans for


[9/24/2024 4:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i mean maybe we are overthinking a little bit, although say for example cloudspinner is a good example where I do know more about the downfall of amberglow than I'm letting on


[9/24/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
But there dm_plans: is kinda fine, it isnt' a secret you have secrets about cloudspinner


[9/24/2024 4:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, sure


[9/24/2024 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
but for outer plans, certain gods, big regions


[9/24/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
it might be useful to distingish between
dm_owner: tim vs dm_owner: open


[9/24/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
species also


[9/24/2024 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
Take centaurs as an example. I have a specific centaur I made up that my PCs might go after at some point.


[9/24/2024 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
It would be somewhat useful for me to know whether you have strong feelings about centaurs beyond what is currently made up or not


[9/24/2024 4:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i think the concept is good, and i'm not opposed, but in practice it is probably usually going to be easier to just check in on discord tbh. 

that is, if i do set dm_owner: open on a page, that would presumably be reliable, but the absence of dm_owner doesn't contain any useful meaning and so it might be the case that it is too noisy and unreliable a signal to be useful anyway


[9/24/2024 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
my concern is that i.e. I ask on discord how much you care about centaurs but then 10 weeks later forget


[9/24/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
well i'm updating the centaur note right now instead of working 😛


[9/24/2024 4:20 PM] .deciusmus
🙂


[9/24/2024 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
but if I don't have time, it would be easy to just set dm_owner in that context, or to set dm_notes / dm_plans


[9/24/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
so i think it useful as a quick way to set an obsidian-based reminder of a quick converastion


[9/24/2024 4:21 PM] rsulfuratus
but the absence of that info shouldn't be relied on to mean anything


[9/24/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
Would it make more sense to just change dm_plans to be mike | tim | shared | none | open


[9/24/2024 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
rather than having dm_plans and dm_owner


[9/24/2024 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that might be easier


[9/24/2024 4:22 PM] rsulfuratus
although what is difference between "none" and "open"


[9/24/2024 4:22 PM] .deciusmus
hrm


[9/24/2024 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
I guess none really


[9/24/2024 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
none just has a different context on a larger page


[9/24/2024 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
but actually


[9/24/2024 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
if part of the point is to obscure somewhat active plots in dunmar


[9/24/2024 4:24 PM] .deciusmus
I guess the question is... is it worth distinguishing between

" I have active plans for this page" vs "the general region/concept/vibe"  is something I care about even if I don't have active plans


[9/24/2024 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
It might make more sense to just set dm_owner and drop dm_plans


[9/24/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
that might actually fit the goal better... there might be a random npc I made up, where i don't specifically have plans for them, but where I also don't really want them to end up dead in the Adderfell game


[9/24/2024 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
whereas some other NPC, I really don't care if they end up the victim of a murder


[9/24/2024 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
The mental idea would basically be:

If DM_Owner: (someone else) then you probably should try not to invent stuff that would require changing the page without checking

If dm_owner: none, go for it


[9/24/2024 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that does seem a bit smoother than plans


[9/24/2024 4:28 PM] rsulfuratus
and is broader and so less likely to be immediately revealing about future sessions


[9/24/2024 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
and it is also nice to be able to flag dm_owner: shared vs jus dm_plans: yes so that I remember you also have plans for something


[9/24/2024 4:29 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[9/24/2024 4:29 PM] .deciusmus
if, I dunno, you wanted Armaund to show up in adderfell say


[9/24/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
ok, different question. what do you tag a page that is complete (all information on the page) but much of the information is kind of vibes based "how might you roleplay an NPC of this species" bullet points not a proper player-facing note?


[9/24/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. look a the new centaur page I pushed


[9/24/2024 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
is that properly tagged? i guess i should actually remove dm_notes as everything is now a comment


[9/24/2024 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
Ok.. I have more work to do.. but to summarize:

(a) remove status/namecheck and status/factcheck with just status/check with a suggested subtag of minor, errors, whereabouts, header, name, mike, tim

(b) implication of check is that anyone can "fix" the page with cross-referenced sources. If the page needs updates from in game info, use status/update (but if it is just xref to session notes, status/check is fine)

(c) change dm_plans to dm_owner. values are mike | tim | none | shared 

if dm_owner is none, it indicates that the page is pretty open. Obviously don't say, kill off all kobolds even if dm_owner is none on the kobold page. But killing off an NPC is ok.

If dm_owner is not none, check in before doing stuff. Sometimes %% on the page will give context though


[9/24/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
Yes I think the centaur page is correctly tagged


[9/24/2024 4:38 PM] .deciusmus
This gets back to your "we don't need a status tag for could use more detail"

{Reactions}
👍

[9/24/2024 4:40 PM] rsulfuratus
right, if someone like kiya wanted to play a centaur you'd likely end up fleshing out a lot of the commented stuff but it doesn't need a tag to indicate there is more to invent


[9/24/2024 4:40 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/24/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
And I think I'd lean even more towards barebones for removing a status tag, at least for now.

if a page 
(a) captures everything that is invented
(b) is at least good enough that a minor NPC could be from there or something
I'd call it done


[9/24/2024 4:41 PM] .deciusmus
or rather, I'd say it doesn't need a status tag


[9/24/2024 4:41 PM] rsulfuratus
👍


[9/24/2024 4:42 PM] .deciusmus
but if you have a stake in further creation and other not-really-ready-to-be-expressed thoughts, set dm_owner: <name> or if it is already set, dm_owner: shared


[9/24/2024 4:43 PM] .deciusmus
eventually I could see the benefit in maybe adding a tag like status/lowdetails or something but I would wait unilt we have more stuff "done"


[9/24/2024 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
still need to work a bit but before i turn back to work pushing a tag update. 

four main status tags:
- check: details need to be checked, either by a specific person, to correct minor errors, to verify names, to fix major errors. by definition cannot be trusted to be correct. usually will have comments which might indicate okay to use
- cleanup: the note is correct and complete but that someone wants to reformat it to make it nicer or more usable (e.g., collate detail from linked pages into summaries, incorporate comments into narrative, etc). never needed and has no bearing on dm facing information but might affect how a page looks on taelgarverse
- needswork: the note does not contain all information about the thing that exists. tread cautiously
- metadata: the note could use metadata cleanup, or non-text updates (images, maps). should never impact usability, although for example don't trust whereabouts for notes with metadata/header tags

other status tags:
- unknown: obsolete but don't remove without checking page to set a more appropriate status or remove
- update: page is actively involved in a campaign and there is recent (or not so recent) session events that impact the text on the page (use metadata/header if only whereabouts need to be updated)
- stub: page is not finished being created

but as per this discussion, no point


[9/24/2024 5:03 PM] rsulfuratus
per this discussion, status/needswork/blankslate is probably also unnecessary?


[9/24/2024 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/24/2024 5:13 PM] rsulfuratus
would you consider this correctly tagged?

[9/24/2024 5:14 PM] .deciusmus
I think a page that has no taelgarverse facing content should probably have a status/cleanup/internal

{Reactions}
👍

[9/24/2024 5:14 PM] .deciusmus
Although I guess in this case, it is a location with a header so maybe not


[9/24/2024 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it should have a sentence or so of taelgarverse content or get a tag


[9/24/2024 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i think i agree with that


[9/24/2024 5:16 PM] .deciusmus
ultimately if the page was something like:

A line of hills that stretches twoard the [[North Chardon Coast]] from the [[Elderwood]].

%% 100 lines of brainstorming about the hills %%

It would be kinda random/up to you whether you wanted to tag as cleanup/internal or not


[9/24/2024 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
but broadly, I think when the %% info is >> more than the public info it is worth tagging cleanup/internal.

what >> means is a bit grey though


[9/24/2024 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
esp as sometimes the %% info isn't really appropriate for taelgarverse anyway


[9/24/2024 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i think it is fine for status/cleanup to a bit arbitrary and more of a "i wish this page were better written" than anything else

{Reactions}
👍

[9/24/2024 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
although I think it is useful to distinguish canonical non-public info via

%%Campaign:^None%%
text
%%^End%%

whereas 

%% text %%

Is less clearly canonical unless the block of text states that it is


[9/24/2024 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
yes that is a good idea

[9/24/2024 5:22 PM] rsulfuratus
would you understand those tags to mean: i have nothing invented but i want some control over the details of that road despite lacking any specific information at the moment


[9/24/2024 5:22 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[9/24/2024 5:23 PM] .deciusmus
or perhaps the logically equivalent: "I have some vague ideas but they are not so well formed as for me to say the page actually needs work"


[9/24/2024 5:31 PM] rsulfuratus
conversely, does this correctly communicate that I have a lot of non-shared information, but conditional on that being shared, i have no particular future ideas or plans for additional development?

#### Emerald Coast

- Needs a name, maybe. Coast of the Emerald bay, southwest of Chardon. 
    
- Ancient, magical canal  ([[Old Chardon Canal]]) cuts through narrow part of the isthmus, allowing seagoing travel, but expensive to navigate for ~to be determined reasons~
    
- Large southern port/trading city, one of the 2-3 largest in Chardon Empire outside Chardon
    
- The northern slopes of the [[~Darba Coastal Mountains~]] are another significant mining area.

[[Yeraad]] river flows through here
%%
```


[9/24/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
yes. although the combination of needswork/external and dm_notes: important is a bit confusing.

I would interpret this as: even a minimal rewrite of the page based on the %% text is dangerous and might result in incorrect page


[9/24/2024 5:32 PM] .deciusmus
whereas if you didn't have the needswork/external I would assume the text of the page is basically ok, but there are important non-conflicting details


[9/24/2024 5:33 PM] rsulfuratus
your interpretation is the correct one. the intention is to communicate that I have contradictory (and more canonical) dm notes

[9/24/2024 5:36 PM] rsulfuratus
is it clear that minimal rewrite - e.g. to remove status/cleanup/internal - is fine?


[9/24/2024 5:37 PM] rsulfuratus
is the NOTE at the bottom sufficient or is dm_notes: important better than color?


[9/24/2024 5:44 PM] .deciusmus
yes; a note that explictly said something like


[9/24/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
NOTE: There is a lot of DM information about the history and population movements in this region, but the map and current day vibe is accurate here


[9/24/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
might be slightly clearer


[9/24/2024 5:45 PM] .deciusmus
but realistically, probably doesn't matter


[9/24/2024 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
or perhaps dm_notes: important is better until we have a "History of Chardonian Empire" page that can be linked and carry the info about the history, including the status/needswork/external tag


[9/24/2024 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
should I do a find/replace of all dm_plans to dm_owner or do you want to fix yourself to update dm_plans: yes to dm_owner: mike or something?


[9/24/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
what you would replace to? just dm_plans to dm_owner so it stays yes?

yes


[9/24/2024 5:59 PM] .deciusmus
thats fine, although I have some dm_plans:no tat I want to make dm_owner: yes on some npcs


[9/24/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus

[9/24/2024 6:04 PM] .deciusmus

[9/24/2024 6:11 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed. added a table to Missing DM Info called Fix that has dm_owner = "yes" or dm_owner = "no"


[9/24/2024 8:44 PM] .deciusmus
I was just browsing your addermarch session notes and I noticed..
"that it has apparently made its lair in a place with a strange -- and not functioning -- fey gate."

Do you have any thoughts on what makes fey gates start/stop functioning? Did I already ask you about this?


[9/24/2024 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
i am not sure there has to be a uniform answer. in this case, the set up was that there were two crystals (presumably originally from the feywild) that served as "anchors" on the material plane


[9/24/2024 8:46 PM] rsulfuratus
one had be damaged, and so the gate couldn't function as it was no longer properly anchored


[9/24/2024 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
I've been playing around with the idea that I might have my PCs get some idea that they could destroy or otherwise disable the portal to duskmire near cleenseau


[9/24/2024 8:47 PM] .deciusmus
as a way to contain umbraeth somewhat


[9/24/2024 8:47 PM] rsulfuratus
I made a stub page for the Kilrath Stone Circle which would be a place where I'd put notes on this


[9/24/2024 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
this was a pretty minor gate in the scheme of things though


[9/24/2024 8:48 PM] .deciusmus
yeah the cleenseau feywild portal is a bigger deal, although it has already been established as a place that opens and closes for mysterious reasons


[9/24/2024 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
something like lastlight falls probably can't be so easily destroyed


[9/24/2024 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
the kind of basic idea I have about extraplanar connections is that they are of two kinds:
- "natural" connections which occur when the higher dimension space of the planes brings some other plane close to the material plane
- "anchored" connections which occur when someone drags a piece of another plane to the material plane


[9/24/2024 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
most things Dunmar has encountered are natural connections - extraplanar weak points, lastlight falls, Arborea ruins


[9/24/2024 8:50 PM] rsulfuratus
these are probably not so easy to destroy as they require reordering extraplanar geometry


[9/24/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, if it is going to be a quest for 8th level characters, it shouldn't be that easy..

{Reactions}
👍

[9/24/2024 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but an anchored connection (e.g., the elemental forge) is easier, you just break the anchor


[9/24/2024 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
right yes, doesn't mean that are impossible to destroy


[9/24/2024 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
in particular, it would be ideal if this portal could only be destroyed from the feywild side


[9/24/2024 8:51 PM] rsulfuratus
just setting up the contrast with e.g. the fey gate in Addermarch which 2nd level charaters could mess with


[9/24/2024 8:52 PM] .deciusmus
which would then set up a whole sequence of... ok, now we need to get home somewhat


[9/24/2024 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, why not, if the goal is you have to reorder extraplanar geometry maybe the only way to do that is by destroying some feature in the feywild that corresponds to something particularly unique in the material plane at that location


[9/24/2024 8:53 PM] rsulfuratus
altering material plane doesn't work because the feywild just echoes and adapts. have to force the feywild itself "far away"


[9/24/2024 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
easy to come up with arbitrary logic like that for interplanar geometry, which should't really feel logical anyway


[9/24/2024 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
I think its clear, but a page like this:

that's clear


[9/25/2024 2:20 PM] .deciusmus
what do you think about the following...

Ethlenn has some natural magic - something about her from before the Riving - that lets her draw the Feywild closer to Taelgar. This means she leaves behind portals, sometimes, and can strengthen a weak spot into a permanent portal. In a way, this is why there are so many fey portals in the fey belt - Ethlenn created them.

The fey portal in Cleenseau is ancient, but collapsed, perhaps during the downfall. It became a weak spot but with a lot of odd resonances and "waves" (i'm imagining almost like a part of the fey wild, or of taelgar that is bouncing or moving and sometimes is a true weak spot, othertimes is far away). 

Rarely, this bouncing odditiy of a portal actually opens, which Umbraeth quite likes, because the portals from Duskmire to Taelgar are all mostly not nearby to human (i.e. in the Darkwood or whatever)

Recently, the lich has made a deal with Umbraeth, and given him a stablizing magic item of some kinda, which lets Umbraeth periodically strengthen and stablize the portal, but it isn't a permanent solution for some reason.

Instead, Umbraeth has learned (possibly also from the lich) that Ethlenn has this magic ability to stabilize portals, and if he can get something infused with Ethlenn's magic, he can stabilize the portal forever.


[9/25/2024 2:24 PM] .deciusmus
"Something infused with Ethlenn's magic" is Elaine II, the Queen of Tyrwingha. She is descended from an Oracle of the Riven, Morgaine, who was clearly a bit unusual (she lived to 113), and the royal line of Tyrwingha is somehow infused with Ethlenn's magic, and Elaine's father, Gyles, was born of some kind of fey magic that allowed his mothers (Annabeth and Morgaine, aforementioned) to have a biological child.

All of this makes Umbraeth believe (perhaps accurately) that if he can kill Elaine and take her heart to the feywild, he can make the portal permaent.

On the other hand, if the lich artifact keeping it open at the moment is destroyed on the feywild side, the echoes of the destruction will close the portal forever


[9/25/2024 2:25 PM] .deciusmus
Perhaps even better is if Umbraeth has learned this independently of the lich; having the lich be defeated and snagging Elaine when she becomes queen of sembara is probably easier for him than getting her in tyrwingha, which would be very hard


[10/3/2024 3:46 PM] .deciusmus
Any chance you had a chance to look at this? Doing some plotting for my next session and wanted to start dropping some hints


[10/4/2024 1:47 PM] rsulfuratus
Seems fine to me. Fey portals are supposed to be weird and unpredictable, and there is something similar (not the portal but fey influence leaking over) in the Darkwood, for example


[10/10/2024 11:36 AM] rsulfuratus
i am going to push all my notes on Ra'ghemdros' hoard later tonight. if it would be entertaining for you to work out exactly what you can take with you given the space constraints in the portable hole, there are volume notes there. if you'd find that tedious, i'll just pick some arbitrary stuff focusing on diamonds/rubies. i highly doubt anyone else would take time out of session to sort through things and session time is better saved for magic items


[10/10/2024 11:37 AM] rsulfuratus
once I finally get caught up from colorado and finish making up drankor, i'm going to return to the dm notes / dm status stuff....but unclear when that will be tbh


[10/10/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
I may take a look later


[10/10/2024 2:33 PM] .deciusmus
But at the moment am focused on prep for my game this weekend, plus a lot of work


[10/10/2024 2:35 PM] .deciusmus
I assume you have no objections to the following being canonical:
* Something magical about Ethlenn specifically makes fey gates appear or perhaps just strengthens existing portals
* This magic can, in some fashion, flow towards powerful people under her protection
* Neither of these facts are well understood in Tyrwingha, although presumably the Oracle of the Riven knows them


[10/10/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
no that all seems fine


[10/10/2024 2:36 PM] rsulfuratus
although not quite sure what the second bullet point means?


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i also need two more magic items from the dragon hoard if you have any ideas


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
Basically I need a MacGuffin to make it so that Elaine II's heart/body/death in some fashion would strengthen a fey gate


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
(or perhaps sacrifice)


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
ah


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] rsulfuratus
sure


[10/10/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
The exact details of the macguffin don't matter for a while actually.


[10/10/2024 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, certainly it would make sense for people under Ethlenn's protection to have an echo of her magic.


[10/10/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in general fey portals should never, or rarely, be "simple". so far all the ones that exist seem like they require certain conditions to be met in order to activate them. they are way, way, more common than portals to elsewhere (which, generally, are very rare and isolated and require things like going to the heart of an active volcano or a deep trench in the western gulf)


[10/10/2024 2:39 PM] rsulfuratus
but that doesn't mean there is a ton of easy traffic between the feywild and the material plane


[10/10/2024 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., lastlight falls is only open for a moment at sunset each day, that kind of thing


[10/10/2024 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
hence why imo the original settlers often marked portals with things like standing stones, to warn people, because maybe if you are wearing the wrong clothing (a necklace made of a certain kind of common flower) you find yourself in the feywild suddenly because the portal is open for you


[10/10/2024 2:42 PM] rsulfuratus
so ethlenn, perhaps, is able to stablize these portals in a way to allow her favored people to travel more easily, and this is in some sense the basis of the bargain with the people of tyrwingha


[10/10/2024 2:42 PM] .deciusmus
Secondarily, I kinda like the idea of leaving it undetermined whether or not the fey portal in the woods north of  Cleenseau is closed permanently or kept open permanently. I am presuming my pcs will succeed, but although I have a backup plan to keep Elaine alive if they fail to stop her from being kidnapped, it involves Umbraeth ultimately succeeding in his plan to create a permanent portal. 

The region is irrelevant to Dunmar campaign but it could potentially impact Addermarch game?

[10/10/2024 2:45 PM] rsulfuratus
it is far enough away from addermarch probably wont come up for a while


[10/10/2024 2:46 PM] rsulfuratus
plus that game is more like an adventure of the week thing at the moment anyway


[10/10/2024 2:47 PM] .deciusmus
Basically, my plan for the next 5-10 sessions of my game is basically...

(a) Umbraeth decides to betray the lich (PCs may or may not find out about this)
(b) Lich is killed and news spreads
(c) This is part of Umbraeth's plan, because he wants to bring Elaine to Cleenseau region. He might even be working behind the scenes to encourage a royal tour once she is Queen
(d) He sends minions to kidnap her and bring her to the feywild
(e) My players either - 
1) stop the minions but fail to follow up on clues and go into the feywild to destroy the gate permanently (or go, but fail to successfully destroy the gate). At this point the portal stays unstable, flickering on and off randomly over the years.
2) stop the minions and go into the feywild, and destroy the gate
3) fail to stop the minions (and which point some powerful fey from Twilight's Grace will swap places with Elaine for Reasons), at which point the portal becomes permanent and the heart of the Cleenseau wood starts to become much more fey infested


[10/10/2024 10:00 PM] rsulfuratus
i am cleaning up status tags and don't recall if we ever settled on something for "nothing on this page is wrong, there is nothing that is missing in the sense of 'there are notes elsewhere', but probably it could use more thought"


[10/10/2024 10:01 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess just no status tag? e.g. for A  Synthesis of Humanity in Greater Sembara, which was tagged status/check/tim. what is there seems basically right to me, but there are some cultural strands not considered, e.g. Isingue and Cymea


[10/10/2024 10:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think we basically decided either
(A) no tag if the page seems publishable/useable as is
(B) cleanup/internal if the info is useable but the writing needs work
(C) needsworks if the page seems too barebones to even be published/useable

[10/13/2024 5:14 PM] rsulfuratus
two things:
(a) when you get a chance, can you unclaim Tilly from Taelgar Revisited so I can claim her back?
(b) Spent some time cleaning up a bunch of bad data this afternoon in between other things, so tons of changes in Github but mostly e.g. updating header version and other minor edits like that. FYI.

[10/15/2024 12:13 PM] .deciusmus
Simon of Cranford


[10/15/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
removing image: ![[simon-of-cranford.png]] fixed it


[10/15/2024 12:14 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure why that one note had a problem for me and not you


[10/15/2024 12:15 PM] rsulfuratus
I haven't published in a while either


[10/15/2024 12:16 PM] rsulfuratus
the problem is that `!` is a reserved character in yaml


[10/15/2024 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
so the python yaml module is trying to figure out how to generate a tag [[simon-of-cranford.png]] but can


[10/15/2024 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
changing it to:
image: "![[simon-of-cranford.png]]" probably would also work


[10/15/2024 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
but as far as I can see most other notes just use `image: filename.png` so unclear what is being accomplished by using the markdown linking format in yaml


[10/15/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
Nothing


[10/15/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
The note is wrong


[10/15/2024 12:24 PM] .deciusmus
It was probably just a cut and paste error and I meant to have image; filename


[10/15/2024 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
I pushed a Lord Serenveil page fyi


[10/15/2024 2:37 PM] .deciusmus
your house rules file in Campaigns\Mechanics conflicts with my house rule file in Campaigns\Cleenseau\Mechanics\House Rules

I pushed a house rules rename and a bit of detail on Serenveil/de Brunes/the fey I made up from Serenveil's domain


[10/16/2024 3:05 PM] rsulfuratus
looked at the Serenveil stuff a bit, and was thinking a little more last night. 

I like the vibe of Istarias basically being a pawn (at least that is how it reads to me based on your notes), and I like Serenveil as an ally (of sorts, at least) of Ethlenn, but not a vassal. 

I don't yet have any good ideas for what Serenveil's motives are (open to suggestions; presumably the de Brune family cult is deeply involved in whatever this is, although perhaps they have other motivations as well). But I think the dynamic of Serenveil looking to Ethlenn for protection against a stronger bully (Umbraeth) is probably the right vibe and seems consistent with both campaigns so far.


[10/16/2024 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I'm not sure how much of the Umbraeth / Ethlenn dynamic is really developed or canon, but clearly in the past ~700 years (since the fall of Amberglow), Umbraeth has been grabbing territory, getting more powerful, expanding his domain, and so it is possible that Serenveil is a window into how the kind of unconnected fey feel about this, which might be largely a sense of anger at Umbraeth not necessarily for his original offenses, but for being the one with the big stick on the block. and also potentially could involve some annoyance at Ethlenn for not properly dealing with the problem (which, in their eyes, she created in the first place). especially given that Ethlenn clearly has somewhat unusual motives for an archfey given the Tyrwingha connection, etc

I spent a bunch of time playing with the new Midjourney image editor making a doppleganger Delwath token and then realizing of course the doppleganger doesn't have Delwath's gear. here is the best of the bunch if you want to use it as your token or modify from here: https://cdn.midjourney.com/24710520-0572-42be-ac7a-2f0a86be5dbb/0_0.png

[10/31/2024 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm not super busy today and am getting back to some of the dm status stuff and obsidian cleanup, which has taken a back seat to session prep in my taelgar time for a while. is it useful to set dm_notes and dm_owner on pages outside people/places/things/groups? e.g., species, cosomology, religion, etc. most of these would be dm_notes: none, dm_owner: none, but there might be isolated exceptions and I have no particular opinion on whether it is better to have default info set for all pages or just assume blank = none/none


[10/31/2024 11:13 AM] rsulfuratus
setting it makes it easier to find pages that should have it but don't, i guess


[10/31/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
I think there are no so many pages outside people/places and I do think it is useful to be able to find pages without it set


[10/31/2024 11:19 AM] .deciusmus
It is probably a reasonable assumption that cosmology/religion/etc are none/none if unset (vs people/places/things where it is trickier to assume) but if I was in a completest/cleanup mode I'd set the none/nones on the other pages


[10/31/2024 11:20 AM] .deciusmus
there are exceptions, i.e. Duskmire


[10/31/2024 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
right, we would presumably not bother for setting on pages in campaigns, but i can see for cosomology, events, history, etc it might be useful


[10/31/2024 11:20 AM] .deciusmus
yeah


[10/31/2024 11:21 AM] .deciusmus
campaigns is silly, as everything in the campaign folder is implicitly dm_notes: (owner of campaign)


[10/31/2024 11:21 AM] .deciusmus
or whatever


[10/31/2024 11:21 AM] .deciusmus
and campaigns is excluded from a lot of MOC stuff


[10/31/2024 11:21 AM] .deciusmus
but i.e. cosmology I think its valuable


[10/31/2024 11:21 AM] rsulfuratus
i think i did set a few in cosomology when doing a bit of cleanup / reorg there


[10/31/2024 11:22 AM] .deciusmus
yeah, you did


[10/31/2024 11:22 AM] .deciusmus
i.e. dm_owner on plane of fire but not plane of earth, which is (theoritcally) valueable info to me (although my campaign is no where close to the outer planes at the moment, obviously)


[10/31/2024 11:22 AM] .deciusmus
but i.e. setting dm tags on all the feywild realms is definitely worthwhile

[11/1/2024 9:58 AM] rsulfuratus
I have been just hitting "Get random note" and fixing things up when I have 5-10 minutes between meetings or tasks, and have hit a row of organizations lately that makes me want to slightly refactor "organizations". In particular, I'm not sure that notes that describe cultures (Deno'qai, Vargaldi, orc hordes, hobgoblin clans) necessarily make sense in organizations (as opposed to gazeteer). e.g. we have all the various pages on Dunmar/Sembara political organization, culture, society in realms


[11/1/2024 9:58 AM] rsulfuratus
in particular it is a bit tricky to come up with a "type" for something like the Vargaldi note, beyond "culture". it is functionally more like the "Dunmar" page


[11/1/2024 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
We've always had a bit of an organizational problem with "culture" type things.


[11/1/2024 10:06 AM] .deciusmus
like where does "Oracle of the Riven" belong? Should it be in Gazetter under Tyrwingha?


[11/1/2024 10:07 AM] .deciusmus
(probably?)


[11/1/2024 10:07 AM] rsulfuratus
also in cleaning up the vargald note it is apparent we could use pages for things like the Zimka and the Northerners


[11/1/2024 10:07 AM] rsulfuratus
(which would also be strictly culture / history pages)


[11/1/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
but the gazetteer is organized geographically, which makes something like the People of the Rainbow a weird fit


[11/1/2024 10:08 AM] rsulfuratus
I'm actually less concerned with things like the Oracle of the Riven, or the Society of the Open Scroll, which while they could easily fit in either gazeteer or organizations, are clearly organizations by any definition of the word

{Reactions}
👍

[11/1/2024 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
I can see how they are not necessarily a good fit for Organizations (which works better for smaller groups) but I'm not sure where to put them in Gazetteer


[11/1/2024 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm more concerned with things that are more like ancestries that don't work well with the type categorizations of "organization"


[11/1/2024 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. people of the rainbow is really the equivalent of "Sembaran" for orcs,


[11/1/2024 10:10 AM] rsulfuratus
as opposed to e.g. the Hezguli, the group of orcs who became free orcs in adulthood, which is clearly an organization


[11/1/2024 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus
but in some ways I'm less worried about where they "go" and more about how to handle headers and writing style


[11/1/2024 10:12 AM] rsulfuratus
e.g. for a normal organization I'd typically clean up the page by adding a campaign None block with members, and writing the note to try to capture any information about the organizations goals, history, mission


[11/1/2024 10:12 AM] .deciusmus
Right... perhaps introducing a new "page type" of culture would make sense


[11/1/2024 10:13 AM] rsulfuratus
for a culture I'd write in more in the style of the Dunmar page, albeit likely in less detail


[11/1/2024 10:14 AM] .deciusmus
and then we could add cultures either:

(a) under Species
(b) under Gazetteer at a top level
(c) under Gazetteer nested in the geographic region where the culture mostly is
(d) (a) for cultures that don't have a clear geographic fit, (c) for those that do
(e) (b) for cultures that don't have a clear geographic fit, (c) for those that do


[11/1/2024 10:15 AM] .deciusmus
I think ancestry is a good way of thinking about it. Cultures are the pages that should link from a person or thing's "ancestry" tag


[11/1/2024 10:15 AM] rsulfuratus
i don't really have time to undertake a major reorg today so what I might do for now is (a) use "culture" instead of "organization" as the top-level tag where it makes more sense, and (b) make a cultures subdir in organizations to move culture-tagged notes to to prep for any later reorg


[11/1/2024 10:16 AM] .deciusmus
that seems sensible


[11/1/2024 10:17 AM] .deciusmus
you might do organization/culture for now as I think a bunch of stuff depends on the top level tag

[11/2/2024 11:38 AM] .deciusmus

[11/2/2024 12:08 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to push a change that does 2 things:

(a) makes "culture" a new page type, so that a tag of "culture" doesn't cause an unknown page
(b) special cases whereabouts for culture to not be dynamic. I think the use case is very low there and it looks funny to have 2 lines. 
(c) makes the default display line for culture be: boxInfo: "<partOf:AU> <species:AU> <typeOf:AU> <(based in )whereabouts>" 

The website version should work but I haven't tested it much.


[11/2/2024 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
I did test that a culture page wins over an alias for a ancestry tag.

So if we say added a "Sembaran" culture page all the humans with ancestry: Sembaran would (if the header was regenerated) link to the Sembaran culture page rather than the Sembara geopolitical page

But all is not as it seems. The forest is not a traditional forest, where the trees grow straight up from the ground, and where water flows downhill, and where the sky is always above. Instead, it is more a set of forest vignettes, connected by pathways of thought, dream, and magic. A visitor might arrive in a small glade, with ancient trees towering overhead and silver flowers blooming in the moonlight on the forest floor. But walking out of the glade, they might find themselves standing on criss-crossed branches hundreds of feet across, part of the canopy of an unimaginably large tree, looking down at a river of bright stars sparkling like a field of diamonds. Walking around a branch, the visitor might find it narrowing, and narrowing, until they find themselves in the leaves of an ancient oak grove, surrounded by cliffs that go up forever, but growing out of nothing but a field of stars below. Climbing to the base of one of the oaks, the visitor might notice the field of stars becomes, as they pass the edge of the grove,  swaying bridge of twisted vines and moss and delicate orchids with hundreds of complex petals, leading over a gorge between two huge cliffs, with a misty bottom a thousand feet below, and trees growing up out of the bottom of the gorge and stretching into the sky full of stars.

Navigation is a challenge, as the place is partly memory and dream, and so navigation is not really by sight or touch, but by memory and recollection. Some pathways are lit up with magical beacons, and those with eyes to see the magic and the right memories can navigate more easily, although only between some of the major landmarks: the Cascade of Living Stars, the Wind Scar, the First Wilds, the Canopy of the Eldest, others unnamable and unreported. [No specific ideas on what these places are, just tossing out names]


[11/19/2024 10:49 AM] rsulfuratus
The plane is permeated deeply by a sense of age and ancientness -- there are no new growths, no saplings, no green shoots or new plants. Even the blooming flowers, mosses, vines and other small plants are permeated with a sense of age. There are exceptions though: the first is the stars - they often appear bright-new as if they were created moments ago. These stars often appear as if they are just within arms reach, although rarely does one who reaches for them find they really are within arms reach. It is said that the stars are the thoughts of Elmerca, and each continues a true foretelling of some future event. But it is also said that they are dangerous, and burn with a fierce cold and razor-sharp edges. The other exception is magic: out of the ancient trees magical creations regularly 'bloom'. This magic usually upsets the normal order of time: ephemeral things in the material plane are long-lived, and permanent things ephemeral: sparkling fireworks that last for days, or years; small wisps of energy shaped like squirrels, or birds, that dash across the woods and vanish into a tree the next moment; embodied notes of songs, that drift through the realm with a soft hint of music, and gather in flocks where the soft hints crescendo into orchestral triumphs; silver-flecked granite boulders, that last just long enough to serve as a stepping stone over a stream, and then scattering into a flurry of glittering silver; salty raindrops, like tears, the slowly drift down (or up) from the sky carrying pervasive sense of melancholy.


[11/19/2024 6:14 PM] .deciusmus
In general I like that. One thought is is there 1 domain or 2? do the various elder races typically have a single divine realm?


[11/19/2024 6:16 PM] .deciusmus
Also I wonder if there should be some type of sense of connection to the mela / leya connection. Is there a tide or sense in Aldanor's realm of the mela/leya? Does it originate there somehow?


[11/19/2024 7:06 PM] .deciusmus
Would it make sense for Ethlenns ability to pull taelgar and the Feywild closer together and strengthen/make portals to be in some way metaphysically similar to the moon’s planar tides


[11/19/2024 7:06 PM] .deciusmus
?


[11/19/2024 7:06 PM] .deciusmus
Not suggesting that Ethlenn is anyway related to the moon, but rather than there is some commonality in the metaphysics


[11/19/2024 10:48 PM] rsulfuratus
I think so far I've tended to think of a single divine realm for the each set of Firstborn / Embodied Gods. E.g, dwarves have just the Heart of the Mountain for all the Baharzel.


[11/19/2024 10:48 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that makes sense


[11/19/2024 10:49 PM] rsulfuratus
re: tides - I think conceptually yes to both some kind of "tide" from Aldanor's realm and some vague metaphysical relationship between the moon's planar tides and Ethlenn's


[11/19/2024 10:50 PM] rsulfuratus
but also I think this is very vague - just a sense of there being a kind of tide-like phenonmenon, which is mysterious, but can potentially be controlling various ways and influenced by various powers


[11/19/2024 10:51 PM] rsulfuratus
but e.g. there could be an interesting lore connection with your lunar sorcerer, for example


[11/19/2024 10:55 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that is why I was thinking about it


[11/19/2024 11:08 PM] .deciusmus
Specifically I was thinking that his lunar magic would help/be key in figuring out the basic plot of “needs some part of Ethlenn’s magic to keep portal open”


[1/2/2025 3:40 PM] rsulfuratus
working out some possible endings for the whole Dunmar/Chardon war, Kenzo's attempts to provoke unrest in the chalyte trade, and the rump part of the Cleansed. while some things are up in the air based on what your party does, especially w/r/t the Crown, some things are probably in motion already and could potentially result in major upheavals to the political landscape of Dunmar and the Chardonian Empire. curious how much you care about the outcomes here. this is obviously significantly later than your campaign, and far away, so might never matter.


[1/2/2025 4:05 PM] .deciusmus
from my game perspective, doesn't matter. Even with some time skips my game will never get to the 1740s and also I have no real plans to ever have the game in Chardon or Dunmar.


[1/2/2025 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
from a pure worldbuilding perspective, and the idea of some kind of canonical 1750s Taelgar, I care a bit although I've always considered myself more of an observer on everything west of the Sentinals


[1/2/2025 4:06 PM] .deciusmus
I was considering having Delwath make a play to take and keep the crown as a way of bringing peace and an end to war


[1/2/2025 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
It would obviously get complex and maybe require making a new 17th level character....


[1/2/2025 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
But he was really interested in the idea that the crown could end wars


[1/2/2025 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
or at least, some wars


[1/2/2025 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i am very happy with the crown as an artifact


[1/2/2025 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
yeah its really cool


[1/2/2025 4:08 PM] rsulfuratus
potentially there would be a time skip after the final battle tonight so there could be plenty of options for new characters, changing things up, etc


[1/2/2025 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
So I am really unsure, and obviously I like Delwath, and also don't want to disrupt the party or have Delwath become a villian that Wellby or anyone else feels compelled to hunt down


[1/2/2025 4:10 PM] .deciusmus
But it would be very in character for him, I think, to want to bring peace and a final end to the Great War


[1/2/2025 4:12 PM] .deciusmus
I could totally see him taking the crown and saying goodbye to the party in some fashion. Conceptually if he wanted to become a villian, he could pretty easily, it would be very hard for the party to find him if he plane shifted somewhere immediately after grabbing the crown. But I definitely don't want Delwath to end up a villian (although hunting him down and ending the scourge of the crown would be a cool arc)


[1/2/2025 4:13 PM] rsulfuratus
the idea behind the crown is supposed to be pretty clear that it doesn't force you to become a villain. it is dangerous - very dangerous in the wrong hands - but it would not force delwath to become evil


[1/2/2025 4:13 PM] .deciusmus
Right, I know


[1/2/2025 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
But of course he has a lot of pain in his backstory - if I wanted (which I don't) - his arc to be one of fall from grace the crown would be the kind of artifact that might encourage that...


[1/2/2025 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
in the sense of power corrupts, not in the sense of the crown itself corrupts


[1/2/2025 4:14 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/2/2025 4:14 PM] .deciusmus
But that doesn't work for me


[1/2/2025 4:15 PM] .deciusmus
But the idea of delwath the peacemaker running off with the crown is a little bit appealing


[1/2/2025 4:16 PM] rsulfuratus
if you want to go for that after the apollyon fight, from a meta perspective it would totally work and it would be easy to work in a new character in the gap between tonight and the next arc


[1/2/2025 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
I could even play in his death, actually (which to be honest was a little bit unsatisfying, it might have played better in reaction to something, it felt a bit anticlimatic... but anyway)...

I could imagine Delwath coming back from the dead with a new perspective - a broader one


[1/2/2025 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
less "my companions" and more "all people"


[1/2/2025 4:19 PM] .deciusmus
sorta pernonar esque


[1/2/2025 4:19 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, that could be good


[1/2/2025 4:20 PM] rsulfuratus
i think i was trying to manage too many things and was too subtle about delwath's death - it was supposed to be more clear that apollyon absolutely hates elves


[1/2/2025 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, that kinda got lost


[1/2/2025 4:21 PM] .deciusmus
but makes sense in retrospect


[1/2/2025 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
Does it make sense from a worldbuilding perspective to basically have Delwath succeeed at bringing peace, at least as far as Chardonioan Empire and its expansion and Dunmar is concerned?

I think Delwath would see "peace" as a checked Chardonian Empire, satisfied with is territory, and not expansionist, and likely/perhaps a growing place of friendship with elves?


[1/2/2025 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
Assuming the end of the campaign is freeing Isingue from the acid monster, that would setup the 1750s to be really quite peaceful and golden-ageish?

It wouldn't be satisfying for Delwath to run off with the crown and then ultimately fail


[1/2/2025 4:30 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a few possible strands here from a worldbuliding perspective.

i am definitely expected some of the Cleansed to survive, either as an underground cult or the power behind a puppet/client state, worshipping a cult of Apollyon. 

i think the Chardonian Empire as designed is too big and makes the west feel a bit boring, so there is a good chance that there is some internal fragmentation. exactly how is unclear and tbd but, e.g., if Chardon turns against the chaltyte trade you could have Voltara in the north break away (rebelling against new Chalyte Control Laws) or something. 

i think if Delwath ran off with the crown, it would be very reasonable for success to look like a smaller Chardonian Empire, renewed peace with the elves and Dunmar, but likely still conflict in the north with the mercantilist oligarchs of voltara and the remnants of the cult of Apollyon


[1/2/2025 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if Chardon turned away from expansionist tendancies in the east, you could have peace with the Deno'qai of the Elderwood and reestablished ties with elves who might return to some of the forests north of the Elderwood


[1/2/2025 4:31 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah that makes sense


[1/2/2025 4:32 PM] .deciusmus
I might sound out everyone else at the beginning of the session - don’t want to do it if Wellby or Kenzo would feel compelled to hunt Delwath down and take the crown back by force or something


[1/2/2025 8:14 PM] .deciusmus
So what is the next arc? Part of the question here is could I come up with a good Delwath alternative... I guess it shouldn't be that hard?


[1/2/2025 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
It is I guess possible you are not even sure


[1/2/2025 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
I can't decide if it is unsatisfying to not end with the same character


[1/2/2025 8:16 PM] rsulfuratus
I am not sure - but my hope was to finish the Frankar arc before Eric's second kid is born, so that would potentially be the next arc


[1/2/2025 8:17 PM] rsulfuratus
other than Frankar and the final Isingue arc, I don't have a lot of plans yet, so it is a bit up in the air. but from a metagame perspective it makes more sense to go straight to Frankar


[1/2/2025 8:17 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/2/2025 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
Frankar would be a super easy arc to introduce a new character for


[1/2/2025 8:18 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/2/2025 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
but I think it would be pretty easy no matter what. e.g., if everyone decides to go disrupt the Chardon chalyte trade, then Wazir could jsut level up a lot for example


[1/2/2025 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
I wouldn't let "introduce a new character" stop you if you want to go this route with Delwath. this is the easiest possible point in a long campaign to introduce a new character, imo


[1/2/2025 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
I'm really leaning towards this honestly.


[1/2/2025 8:21 PM] .deciusmus
I kinda want to make sure everyone else is ok though... like to some extent need their cooperation to not stop delwath


[1/2/2025 8:22 PM] rsulfuratus
I think you can wait until after Apollyon imo


[1/2/2025 8:22 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/2/2025 11:55 PM] .deciusmus
Did you already know the source of the crown or did you just make this up? awesome either way


[1/3/2025 12:01 AM] rsulfuratus
i knew some of it - just make up the came from the riving


[1/6/2025 10:32 PM] rsulfuratus
kate and i talked for a while about Riswynn and the crown. basically she is happy for Riswynn to take the crown if it seems like it makes sense from either meta or in-game perspective (and I kind of like the worldbuilding implications of the free-more-orcs quest), and it would be a satisfying character arc for riswynn in a lot of ways - but as kate put it, riswynn cares a lot more about the orcs than kate does. and kate doesn't have a particularly strong desire to make a new character (she would probably just make a new cleric anyway).


[1/6/2025 10:35 PM] rsulfuratus
so the upshot is, i think, that if you end up thinking about it some more and feel like you really want delwath's character arc to end with taking the crown, or if you are excited about a new character, you should take priority for claiming the crown


[1/6/2025 10:36 PM] rsulfuratus
but alternatively if delwath just wants someone to use it and the only quest everyone can agree on is 'free the orcs' kate is happy for riswynn to take that on


[1/6/2025 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
a minor advantage of introducing a new character now to replace delwath might be using that character's backstory to better set up / add context to the isingue / plaguelands final arc that is intended to end the campaign


[1/6/2025 10:37 PM] rsulfuratus
(although that might steer too close to beryl-related things which you might want to avoid)


[1/6/2025 10:38 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway, no rush to reply as i'm sure you are busy with bar mitzvah stuff as well but would be good to get some thoughts before next tuesday


[1/7/2025 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
My basic thoughts are…
(A) In-game, Delwath doesn’t want to see the crown destroyed. But he trusts Riswynn or himself to use it for good
(B) from an abstract world building perspective Riswynn using it to expand the free orcs seems more interesting than Delwath using it to finish cleaning up the mess from Apollyon and bring back some degree of friendship between the elves and the humans 
(C) on the other hand; a revival of the Peronar via Delwath could be interesting world-building wise. 
(D) from a meta perspective hunting down cultists of apolloyon in the north doesn’t seem that fun as the next major arc ie compared to extra planar stuff. Delwath taking the crown to do that type of thing is an in-game out for why the rest of the party doesn’t do that
(E) I like Delwath and would be happy to finish out the arc but also have several ideas for other characters that I’d be interested in playing
(F) it does seem a little unsatisfying to NPCize Delwath rather than playing him out to level 20


[1/7/2025 4:58 PM] .deciusmus
On (E) I was noodling around with…

A circle of the moon Druid (probably human maybe stone born)
A fey wanderer ranger (perhaps himself fey)
A paladin of the sibyl/wildling/night queen or maybe the skar ocean god


[1/7/2025 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
Druid kinda interesting but not a good balance for the party - another high charisma character makes more sense I think


[1/7/2025 4:59 PM] .deciusmus
Oh my other idea was a draconic sorcerer


[1/7/2025 5:03 PM] .deciusmus
I think my basic position is 
(A) it would be a little unsatisfying to just destroy the crown both from a world building and a in-game character perspective
(B) I’d really have fun making up a new character that hooks into the next arc in some fashion
(C) I’m a little torn about giving up Delwath


[1/7/2025 5:04 PM] .deciusmus
So I’d prefer either Riswynn or Delwath take it but could easily go one way or the other. I think given Kate isn’t excited about a new character and I am, I’d lean toward Delwath taking it, unless world-building or other people opinions pushed the other way


[1/7/2025 8:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i think this all makes sense and given this perspective and what kate and I discussed it might make the most sense to just throw it open to everyone next week.

i am not really excited about running a "hunting down cultists of apollyon" arc either so if everyone feels you can't leave that thread hanging i would push for delwath taking the crown


[1/7/2025 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
but also you can't solve all the problems in the world or it will be too safe and peaceful for the next campaign....


[1/7/2025 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
anyway this is a helpful perspective


[1/7/2025 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
as a side note - i am keeping in mind the idea of a level 20 mini-arc sometime in the future (not as part of this campaign, but maybe in a couple of years after we've started something new), after delwath or riswynn has done what they can with the crown, where you all get back together to destroy it once and for all. so there could be an opportunity to play level 20 delwath later on even if he is NPCized at the moment


[1/7/2025 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
A ranger using a magic quarterstaff is probaly too Beryl-like, but its a little tempting.

Fey wanderer ranger with drudic cantrips so just uses Shillelagh to fight in melee without a very good strength


[1/7/2025 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
I've always liked the idea of the shillelagh ranger


[1/7/2025 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
but it does feel a little beryl-esque


[1/7/2025 9:57 PM] rsulfuratus
the new version of sorcerer looks really fun at high levels, one of the best level 20 features in the game


[1/7/2025 10:10 PM] rsulfuratus
actually moon druid could be a lot of fun too - honestly party doesn't really need a high charisma character, wellby at least is proficient in persuasion and intimidation so min roll is 15 already, plus inspiration


[1/7/2025 10:11 PM] rsulfuratus
moon druid could be a good opportunity to develop the moon before your lunar sorcerer gets too high level


[1/7/2025 10:15 PM] .deciusmus
So of my 4 ideas (draconic sorcerer, moon druid, paladin of some kind, or fey wanderer ranger) the moon druid and fey wanderer were the most interesting to me


[1/7/2025 10:17 PM] .deciusmus
Sorcerer seems the most fun from a mechanics perspective but I don’t have a great idea for world background. Also I felt like losing a front line fighter type might be less ideal (ie going with sorcerer)


[1/7/2025 10:19 PM] .deciusmus
I was leaning away from moon druid due to lack of cha but maybe you are right that doesn’t really matter


[1/7/2025 10:20 PM] rsulfuratus
It might be premature until seeing what happens at the discussion next week but from a worldbuilding point of view high level moon or dragon characters seem the most interesting to me


[1/7/2025 10:20 PM] .deciusmus
Not very inspired by paladin except that smite with Delwath is pretty fun. But I think I might save paladin for something else


[1/7/2025 10:21 PM] rsulfuratus
Seeker makes everyone an effective face, more or less


[1/7/2025 10:22 PM] .deciusmus
I was thinking a fey who was a fey wanderer using a shilleghah as a weapon seemed kinda fun. But that might also be a good low level character


[1/7/2025 10:22 PM] .deciusmus
Moon druid and draconic sorcerer might be better high level options


[1/7/2025 10:23 PM] rsulfuratus
I like them all but I do think the fey wanderer ranger build specifically doesn’t get a lot from being high level particularly


[1/7/2025 10:24 PM] rsulfuratus
But, it might be a fun character to tie to Isingue / cloud spinner / amber glow


[1/7/2025 10:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right. The background I had in mind was something from amber glow who had heard about cloudspinner somehow


[1/7/2025 10:26 PM] rsulfuratus
Moon Druid could have a similar backstory I think


[1/7/2025 10:27 PM] rsulfuratus
Anyway lots of good ideas imo


[1/7/2025 10:28 PM] rsulfuratus
Actually Kate was kind of into playing a Light cleric since she likes all the sunlight type spells so she might actually be more into a new character than appears on the surface, would just be similar mechanically to Riswynn in some ways


[1/14/2025 3:57 PM] rsulfuratus
finally got rid of all status/unknown tags


[1/14/2025 4:07 PM] .deciusmus
nice...


[1/14/2025 4:08 PM] .deciusmus
I'm looking at your Cleanup DM Info page and I wonder about dm_owner: none dm_notes: color


[1/14/2025 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
I used it a lot to mean: "I have no attachment or further plans for this person, but I haven't captured everything that came up in game around the person/place/etc"


[1/14/2025 4:09 PM] rsulfuratus
ideally those would be prioritized for whoever has color notes to incorporate. i believe the intention is that indicates "i have some notes but don't feel any ownership of this page"


[1/14/2025 4:09 PM] .deciusmus
right, I guess that is the same as what I just said

{Reactions}
👍

[1/14/2025 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
I removed "player" from the DM_owner none list


[1/14/2025 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
I think PC pages should not show up on our "needs" work pages as they are instrictially somewhat stub-like


[1/14/2025 4:27 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/14/2025 4:52 PM] rsulfuratus
what is the correct tagging for something like Yeraad River Basin? there is minimal canonical information but it is an obvious blank spot on the map with some brainstorming details. it doesn't feel like status/needswork is correct since we are trying to reserve that for notes that are incorrect in various ways. but it is not a stub either


[1/14/2025 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
this type of thing was what I had originally created "blankslate" or whatever for


[1/14/2025 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
but I think we decided no status is better


[1/14/2025 4:55 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure that is totally right


[1/14/2025 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
what we really need is something like a script that identifies notes with either very high comment to real text ratios, or low text to backlink ratios


[1/14/2025 4:57 PM] .deciusmus
But why?


[1/14/2025 4:57 PM] rsulfuratus
to identify pages that either have lots of brainstorming to work on, or pages that are underdescribed for their importance


[1/14/2025 4:58 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe it doesn't really matter


[1/14/2025 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't like a tag for this because i like having status tags be a clear indication of "there is something about this page you shouldn't trust"


[1/14/2025 4:59 PM] rsulfuratus
(in some cases it is just e.g. header information which isn't usually a big deal)


[1/14/2025 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
and the dm_notes / dm_owner does a great job of "page is correct, there is additional information"


[1/14/2025 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
I guess what I mean is...

(a) we have a set of status/cleanup and related tags. This identifies pages that need fiddly cleanup. Useful as a "just go through and clean up" list, similar to say photo tagging or whatever. A sometimes fun way to waste 30 minutes between meetings or when you want to do something productive or whatever

(b) dm_owner/dm_info which tracks stuff that has been made up or is active for a game, that isn't well captured in obsidian. that's stuff to write down for the purposes of running games mostly

(c) status/needswork, status/stub and related - clear indicator that the page itself is not trustworthy, but its important enough that thing has been invented


[1/14/2025 5:00 PM] .deciusmus
The question is... 

Do we need a way to identify "random actual worldbuilding unrelated to an ongoing game"


[1/14/2025 5:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right, maybe not


[1/14/2025 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
In particular, pages with low text to backlink but no status or dm tags suggests "open areas" of the world that would be valuable to make up, in some sense


[1/14/2025 5:01 PM] .deciusmus
similarly, high comment to text ratio is stuff we are clearly interested in, but that no one has taken forward, probably because it isn't relevant to a game

I could kinda see the value of a "help wanted" type tag, for pages that seem empty compared to what they _should_ be but where the implication is that it is a good source of random invention


[1/14/2025 5:02 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, a place where random invention is fine, subject to all the normal discussions and such


[1/14/2025 5:04 PM] rsulfuratus
i think i'm now convinced our original approach was right after this brief discussion. we don't really need a tag for this kind of thing. i might do a little analysis out of curiosity, to e.g. find things that have tons of backlinks but very short pages (suggests places where i've done a bad job incorporating dm notes, perhaps), but from a tagging point of view it seems nicer to keep status tags and dm frontmatter clean


[1/14/2025 5:06 PM] .deciusmus
There are probably a lot of places in Sembara with high backlinks, low text as I invented a lot of names and tend to make people from those places, but don't actually have any of the places themselves made up


[1/14/2025 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, since you don't have transcripts and session notes in the same way it is harder for the sembara game. things that have lots of backlinks to session notes are what i was thinking.


[1/14/2025 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/14/2025 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
things like rivers and small villages tend to get lots of cross links but don't show up in many session notes


[1/14/2025 5:07 PM] .deciusmus
Kiya has actually been writing session notes for each game, which is nice but I haven't been good about pulling them into obsidian and backlinking them


[1/14/2025 5:07 PM] rsulfuratus
whereas candrosa is in 13 session notes but only has one sentence of (public) text


[1/14/2025 5:08 PM] rsulfuratus
so obviously incomplete


[1/14/2025 5:08 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/14/2025 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
here is another one:

# Incorporeal Gods

%% tagging status/tim, status/mike as there are some decisions that probably should be made about the metaphysics of different types of gods. might need a better tag for "unclear cannon that needs to be decided" %%

think we might need a different status tag for this, maybe status/needswork/shared?


[1/14/2025 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't really a "status/check" case


[1/14/2025 5:19 PM] rsulfuratus
Kestavo has same issues


[1/14/2025 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus
this page, imo, should not have a status/needswork tag.

[1/14/2025 5:30 PM] rsulfuratus

[1/14/2025 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
A few comments:

(a) something like status/needswork/decision or status/needswork/shared seems to correctly indicate the idea that there is some actual work to decide on what is canon. 

(b) I like using status/check/mike, status/check/tim to indicate a page that appears in good shape but where someone wants to come back and review it as well as have the other one review.


[1/14/2025 6:19 PM] .deciusmus
for (b) if I took 30 minutes to go over the kestavo doc and move to %% the non-core bits and delete some old stuff, I might want to leave status/check/mike to remind myself to revisit after I had let it sit for a day


[1/14/2025 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
but also I agree that status/check should not be used on pages where the ask is to read it and rewrite sections; it means the common action is to remove status/check only


[1/14/2025 6:20 PM] .deciusmus
so the current kestavo page is probably something else


[1/14/2025 6:21 PM] .deciusmus
I think the incorporeal god page is probably reasonable as status/check/mike status/check/tim as the bare text not in %% is actually fine and introduces no need for decisions about canon.


[1/14/2025 6:23 PM] .deciusmus
I would go back to the basic idea, which is that we are not trying to use status tags to capture all the work we COULD do, just the state of the page.


[1/14/2025 6:37 PM] .deciusmus
On Alaric wanted to have at least a sentence or two about him before marking as complete


[1/14/2025 6:47 PM] rsulfuratus
so in that case I think the correct status tag is status/stub? which means "incomplete" for any definition of incomplete. my aim is to have status/needswork exclusively refer to pages where there is something wrong or non-canon about the text itself


[1/14/2025 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
Ah fair


[1/14/2025 6:49 PM] .deciusmus
Good point


[1/14/2025 6:52 PM] rsulfuratus
basically my goal is:
- status/update, status/stub = page is incomplete, either because it was never finished or because events have proceeded
- status/cleanup = someone wants to rewrite or thinks the page needs a rewrite
- status/metadata = header, image, etc work
- status/check =  review, not rewrite

with trying to keep status/needswork to a handful of pages that really need work because they are misleading. ideally there would be nothing in status/needswork


[1/14/2025 6:55 PM] rsulfuratus
this is a bit of a change from how we've treated status/stub before, which was "needs a header" so we could have a status/wip or something to distinguish true stubs from "not enough information for author to consider finished"


[1/14/2025 6:56 PM] rsulfuratus
i just want status/needswork to be cleanly the pages with bad/misleading information only

{Reactions}
👍

[1/14/2025 7:26 PM] rsulfuratus
I think: 'status/cleanup/internal' is the most useful status tag for this (Alesh):

%% needs work: lots of information about chronology, travels, and party contact scattered throughout session notes, that needs to be incorporated and cleaned up %%


[1/15/2025 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
this is a slow week at work (all the students are mostly still on winter break), i'm pretty motivated to try to do a big cleanup to get our tagging system to accurately reflect the state of taelgarverse and clean up a few lingering tag conflicts


[1/15/2025 10:09 AM] rsulfuratus
a few questions incoming


[1/15/2025 10:14 AM] rsulfuratus
(1) our current descriptive tag system feels pretty good, except:
- subtags still linger in some places. for items and organizations they are used inconsistently and incompletely. for religions and pcs they are mostly/entirely complete. 
- we have both event and event-source and it isn't obvious what distinguishes them

Question 1: is there any point in cleaning up subtags? it is quite easy to just delete a bunch. in most cases subtags have been superceded by typeOf, ancestry, and various related frontmatter. 

Question 2: do you remember the distinction between event and event-source?


[1/15/2025 10:20 AM] rsulfuratus
(2) we have likely way too many things tagged with status, especially status/needswork, since at one point (before dm frontmatter existed) we used status/needswork to indicate a page was incomplete, not wrong. 

Question 3: any opinions on the best way to quickly clean this up, especially for notes you wrote? I can just tag a bunch of stuff status/check/mike, perhaps easiest, but open to other ideas. probably going to blast through a lot of this this afternoon

Question 4: do we need a status tag for "work in progress" that indicates a page is more complete than a stub but not "finished"? My inclincation is no, but open to ideas. Potentially this might be status/cleanup/wip, not status/needswork/wip. 

My general feeling is status/needwork and status/check (page is wrong, not canon) should be ideally kept small and be high priority to fix, while status/cleanup and status/metadata can be whatever.


[1/15/2025 11:27 AM] .deciusmus
Question 1:

Subtags are good for searching but are a bit of a pain to parse compared to typeOf/subTypeOf/etc for header generation. Arguably a subtag and a typeOf or subType really serve the same purpose but we seem to have settled on custom frontmatter and it doesn't seem worth chaning.

For me, I think I'd bulk delete organization subtags as looking at them I don't see the value.

For items, I think there is value in having a subtag specifically for "mechanics" items, i.e. anything a player might get and where mechanics might make sense for it. I actually don't think the magical vs mundane distinction is useful. A distinction for "specific instance" vs "kind" might be useful as well, in the subtags. But otherwise, I think the list we have is not that useful


[1/15/2025 11:29 AM] .deciusmus
Naming is hard, but maybe something like

item/equipment or item/equippable (for magical and mundane items for which playable stats would be sensible to make up)


[1/15/2025 11:30 AM] .deciusmus
although actually I think the implication of subtags is probably that everything should have one


[1/15/2025 11:32 AM] .deciusmus
So maybe we want 

item/equipment
item/vehicle
item/material
item/other


[1/15/2025 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
with the idea that "equipment" is pages for either a class ("drankorian sending stones") or a specific item ("Ewer of Liquid (Cleenseau)") that would make sense as PC equipment.

vehicle is boats, skyships, barges, wagons, caravans, whatever

material is substances and other raw materials ("coinage" might fit here)

other is everything else


[1/15/2025 11:34 AM] .deciusmus
there could be an item/artifacts as well for legendary stuff that is in-theory equipment but isn't really viableto make up mechanics for but not sure if that is worthwhile


[1/15/2025 11:55 AM] rsulfuratus
re: subtypes:
agree organization subtypes are useless; i will mass delete and change to typeOf if missing
-


[1/15/2025 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
agree items probably do want subtags. might need to think a bit on what. "specific instance" vs "kind" is useful, as is "equipment vs not"


[1/15/2025 11:57 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm not convinced vehicles should be "items"


[1/15/2025 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
re: vehicles - fair, probably something that could reasoonably have a different top level; that said, there is javascript work for getting headers right for a new top-level that might not be worthwhile


[1/15/2025 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
re: specific instance vs kind  and "equp vs not" - I don't love having multiple subtags - although maybe that is fine? so I was leaning in on "equp vs not" as more useful


[1/15/2025 11:59 AM] .deciusmus
but maybe just having

item/specific
item/kind
item/equipment
item/other

is sufficient? and items would generally have 2 tags


[1/15/2025 12:00 PM] rsulfuratus
hmm. actually now kind of wondering what we are going to use those subtags for, exactly


[1/15/2025 12:02 PM] .deciusmus
for me specifically, I am trying to move away from D&D Beyond for various reasons in my game, and was going to use item/equipment to find mechanics to cleanup/port into obsidian.

But on typing that out, it is much more obviously just a status/cleanup/mechanics


[1/15/2025 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
So I guess, maybe kill item subtags for now as well?


[1/15/2025 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
if we were going on another round of javascript work to improve headers, you probably want three things:
(1) specific equipabble items, whether unique or specific named instances of a particular thing (e.g., Crown of Purity, Ewer of Liquid (Cleenseau), Apollyon's Crystal Ball, Eudomes' Enchiridon of the Occulta Ludum)
(2) generic "things that exist in the game", which might be: books (A Fool's Fortune), materials (adamantine), generic kinds of magic or mundane items (Urskan Dragonhide Armor).
(3) vehicles


[1/15/2025 12:05 PM] rsulfuratus
but that would probably involve a lot of tag updates and possibly promoting things to top level tags, so i think i agree existing item subtags are useless


[1/15/2025 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
an alternative would be to make 3 subtags


[1/15/2025 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
items/equipment
items/vehicles
items/other


[1/15/2025 12:06 PM] .deciusmus
the javascript doesn't care about subtags, and it means the data is organized if we ever did want to do the javascript header work


[1/15/2025 12:06 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, hmm, that's not a bad idea


[1/15/2025 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
and being able to look at all items/other in isolation might also inspire some further organization


[1/15/2025 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
right, so in this categorization equipment is not precisely equipment, but rather "something you could list on your character sheet"


[1/15/2025 12:07 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/15/2025 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
there is a rough edge around generic items, i.e. horn of silent alarm or drankorian message stones


[1/15/2025 12:09 PM] .deciusmus
or scroll of storykeeping


[1/15/2025 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
so at the moment i have decided against having pages for the specific instances of these things


[1/15/2025 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
right, I just mean are they items/equipment or items/other


[1/15/2025 12:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i think items other


[1/15/2025 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
right so "items/equipment" means "a page for a specific thing"


[1/15/2025 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
the page is clearly written about the class of items. if there was a page for "Delwath's Horn of Silent Alarm" that would be item/equipement


[1/15/2025 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/15/2025 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
makes sense


[1/15/2025 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
the tricky ones are actually things like the mirror of the past, which i haven't decided if it is a generic item or a specific item unique to eudomes. but the page is clearly written about a specific item, so it gets item/equipment, and if this becomes a generic class of things then there are two pages, one for Eudomes' mirror of the past and one for Mirrors of the Past (in general)


[1/15/2025 12:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i already did a lot of refactoring at one point to clean this up so I think it is actually pretty straightforward to tag the page as written as either a specific thing (equipment) or a generic class (other)

{Reactions}
👍

[1/15/2025 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
On question 2: event vs event-source. The original idea was that event-source could be added to OTHER pages that had tagged events in (DR:: yyyy) format to build automatic timelines


[1/15/2025 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
whereas event is a "page categorization" tag


[1/15/2025 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
but I'm not sure if I ever finished the code for that and I'm not sure it really works


[1/15/2025 12:20 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, okay. that is worth keeping though. so anything that has another tag already should be event-source, anything that is an event should be event


[1/15/2025 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
I actually am not sure it is worth keeping, as the code I have right now doesn't seem to use it


[1/15/2025 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
it just looks for lists with DR values


[1/15/2025 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
across all pages


[1/15/2025 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
you can look at Events\1700s\1700s


[1/15/2025 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
to see it working


[1/15/2025 12:22 PM] rsulfuratus
ah, okay. then yeah i'll delete event-source and just recatogize anything that doesn't have a top level tag


[1/15/2025 12:22 PM] .deciusmus
that 1700s page is actually pretty cool although it is slow to load


[1/15/2025 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
have a meeting in 6 minutes but one more question on categorization tags to wrap that up. religion is the other tag that has (i think complete) subtags. seems kind of useful to keep these? or better to just convert to frontmatter? i'm fairly agnostic although slightly inclined to keep


[1/15/2025 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
I would keep those


[1/15/2025 12:26 PM] .deciusmus
I like being able to get all the mosnumena stuff

{Reactions}
👍

[1/15/2025 12:42 PM] .deciusmus
On status/needswork and status/wip stuff.
I think what we discussed last night makes sense, which to formalize, should be something like:

The original page author should keep it as status/stub until they are happy enough with the basic info. We don't have any specific rules on when you change it away from stub - it could be after adding header, it could be after adding a sentence, it could be after doing more. 

But that means pages with status/stub should be considered basically as "not yet real" at some level (and should be high priority to fix, and should always have a dm_owner)


[1/15/2025 1:01 PM] .deciusmus
So I think broadly that would mean something like...

**status/stub**
Page is missing stuff the page author thought was critical, and should be considered non-canonical. Should always have a dm_owner. 

**status/update**
The page was accurate at some point, but in game events have caused it to be out of date. Should generally have a dm_owner and should be fixed as a priority.

**status/needswork**
The information on the page is contradictory or wrong (not just incomplete) and the page should be considered non-canonical. May not have a dm_owner and may be particularly common on big topic "shared" pages. Should be categorized as to the source of the "correct information": internal (other pages), external (private notes), shared (discord chat, email).

**status/metadata**
The metadata info is missing, out of date, or could use improvement. The page is accurate though, although for example the current whereabouts might be wrong. Often won't have a dmowner but ideally would have a note as to what is wrong or missing. Subtags are not canonical and we might use different ones.

**status/check**
Some specific fact or part of the page needs confirmation but in general it is accurate. Should not be used when a page still needs work.

**status/cleanup**
The page is good enough for in game use, but something about it is lacking or could be improved or fixed.


[1/15/2025 1:08 PM] .deciusmus
A few questions and notes:
(a) do we need a status/needswork/decision or status/needswork/canon to indicate that the page is blocked waiting on deciding whether something is true or not?
(b) do we need a status/needswork/old or status/needswork/outdated to indicate that although there has been no specific conversation, the page feels like it doesn't reflect current thinking? (i.e. the issue isn't that there are notes or discussions that contradict the page, but just it feels inaccurate/wrong?)


[1/15/2025 1:09 PM] .deciusmus
(c) is there value in "canonical" subtags under cleanup? In particular, is **status/cleanup/internal** valueable to indicate that all information is in the page or its backlinks but that the page itself might need work to rewrite and so on


[1/15/2025 1:23 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure we need a predefined set of status/needwork subtags. i do think status/needswork/old and status/needswork/decision might be useful. my goal is to get the status/needswork number down to those pages that are actually incorrect and then it might be more obvious what we need


[1/15/2025 1:24 PM] .deciusmus
Right, that seems reasonable


[1/15/2025 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
I do like status/cleanup/internal a lot


[1/15/2025 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
although again i'm not sure it is obvious until we get the tagged cleaned up in the first place


[1/15/2025 1:24 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g. if there are 10 pages that "deserve" status/cleanup it might not be worth subtags


[1/15/2025 1:25 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So in the top level list above, the only one that isn't clear to me is "metadata"


[1/15/2025 1:26 PM] .deciusmus
What is the difference between status/cleanup/whereabouts and status/metadata/header?


[1/15/2025 1:26 PM] rsulfuratus
nothing


[1/15/2025 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
i kind of like status/metadata as a key for "non-writing cleanup"


[1/15/2025 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
i think i argued we should have that separate because sometimes you don't feel like working on text but e.g. collating campaignInfor or whereabouts


[1/15/2025 1:27 PM] rsulfuratus
but it could arguably be a subtag of status/cleanup, i just don't like three-level tags


[1/15/2025 1:28 PM] .deciusmus
I think 3 level is valuabe here


[1/15/2025 1:28 PM] rsulfuratus
actually meant 4 level. e.g. status/cleanup/metadata/whereabouts


[1/15/2025 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
Ah, I wouldn't bother with that


[1/15/2025 1:29 PM] .deciusmus
either do
status/cleanup/metadata or status/cleanup/whereabouts


[1/15/2025 1:29 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe status/cleanup/metadata is better than status/metadata/header


[1/15/2025 1:30 PM] .deciusmus
I would say that nested lots of options under status/cleanup is fine...

status/cleanup/metadata
status/cleanup/map
status/cleanup/whereabouts
status/cleanup/image
status/cleanup/internal

all have pretty obvious meanings to me


[1/15/2025 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
as would say status/cleanup/campaigninfo


[1/15/2025 1:31 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah. maybe needs a generic status/cleanup/text as well


[1/15/2025 1:31 PM] .deciusmus
actually, status/cleanup/text probably makes more sense than status/cleanup/internal


[1/15/2025 1:32 PM] .deciusmus
I think the theory is that any page with dm_notes: none and no needswork tag is completely documented in obsidian


[1/15/2025 1:32 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2025 1:32 PM] rsulfuratus
i think at one point status/cleanup/internal = lots of comments to fix and status/cleanup/external = lots of backlinks to check


[1/15/2025 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
but the distinction is probably meaningless


[1/15/2025 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
from a tag point of view


[1/15/2025 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
since dm_notes is more direct about "do you need outside information"


[1/15/2025 1:33 PM] .deciusmus
I think status/cleanup/external was a precursor to dm_notes


[1/15/2025 1:33 PM] rsulfuratus
ah yeah that was probably right


[1/15/2025 1:34 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm trying to get all the descriptive tags squared away now but then will turn to status tags unless i get unexpectedly busy this afternoon


[1/15/2025 1:34 PM] rsulfuratus
(i'm running office hours until 4, so far no one has shown up but that could change)


[1/15/2025 1:37 PM] .deciusmus
So I think what we are saying is basically 5 status tags:

stub: original author still working; page is not "real" yet; should have dm_owner
needswork: page is wrong
cleanup: page is fine for in game use, but something is not quite good enough or is missing for it to feel "done". subtag might say what needs fixing.
check: page is fine but something needs to be checked; subtag might say what needs checking
update: page was good; now needs updates from ingame events


[1/15/2025 1:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2025 2:34 PM] rsulfuratus
finished cleaning up "status/cleanup":
- a dozen or so status/cleanup/internal moved to status/check/mike with a note
- about 100 with metadata cleanup needed, largely things I want to add campaignInfo for or that need whereabouts updating. i did not try to retag these
- 22 in text that have various comments about rewriting
- 13 in refactor that have various comments about refactoring necessary (refactor vs text is a judgement call)
- the rest images or maps


[1/15/2025 2:38 PM] rsulfuratus
currently working on correctly splitting the refactor into cleanup/metadata and cleanup/text


[1/15/2025 2:40 PM] .deciusmus
As per the notes above, the difference between status/stub and status/cleanup/(whatever) is flexible, right? so i.e. the Ferrystones, if I didn't feel like writing something "nice" could just be status/cleanup/text, given the %% block of info contains everything I've made up?


[1/15/2025 2:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2025 2:41 PM] rsulfuratus
or honestly doesn't need a status tag at all imo. i would say:
- status/cleanup/stub only if you have more infomration to add
- status/cleanup/text if you think it should have a nice page but you don't want to write it now
- no status if you don't think it needs a nice page


[1/15/2025 2:44 PM] .deciusmus
status/stub is still useful to prevent publication to taelgarverse it occurs to me


[1/15/2025 2:44 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2025 2:45 PM] .deciusmus
so that would be one reason for status/stub rather than no status or status/cleanup/text


[1/15/2025 2:49 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, finished status/cleanup


[1/15/2025 2:51 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at status/check. 
- status/check/whereabouts assume can be merged with status/cleanup/whereabouts?
- things that are status/check/mike and status/check/tim with note about reviewing for correctness. leave, or move to status/needswork/shared?


[1/15/2025 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
I was using status/check/whereabouts specifically for cases where I added whwereabouts but needed to check the dates


[1/15/2025 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
can leave it


[1/15/2025 2:52 PM] .deciusmus
but moving to cleanup is fine if you'd prefer


[1/15/2025 2:52 PM] rsulfuratus
don't care, just checking on intention


[1/15/2025 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
status/needswork to me implies more work than just reading something


[1/15/2025 2:53 PM] .deciusmus
so for example Kestavo is probably status/needswork/shared


[1/15/2025 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
Twilight Court maybe just stays status/check/mike+tim


[1/15/2025 2:57 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a few checkmike cleanups


[1/15/2025 3:01 PM] .deciusmus
I pushed a bunch of status/check/mike fixes


[1/15/2025 3:03 PM] .deciusmus
I also fixed all my status/needswork/wip pages to be status/stub or status/cleanup/text depending


[1/15/2025 3:05 PM] .deciusmus
is the idea that dm_owner: none, dm_notes: color - we will know who has the notes?


[1/15/2025 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
it isn't perfect but i think the idea is it is more useful to communicate lack of future plans/ownership, and we should be able to figure out who has the notes without too much trouble


[1/15/2025 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, makes sense


[1/15/2025 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
for stubs makes sense to always have dm_owner (and change once stub tag is removed if needed), since a stub is hard to use without talking to page author for details


[1/15/2025 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
what are we doing for status on pc pages?


[1/15/2025 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not sure. some of them are obviously stubs; others are complete-ish. in general it is not obvious exactly how much information should be captured on a pc page


[1/15/2025 3:09 PM] rsulfuratus
esp because how they are used varies from person to person and campaign to campaign


[1/15/2025 3:10 PM] rsulfuratus
i would probably say either:
- stub, if they are obviously incomplete
- more or less permanent status/update, if they are being actively updated as part of a campaign
- no status if they are complete enough for reference and used primarily for e.g. backstory


[1/15/2025 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
in all cases should have: 
- dm_owner: player
- dm_info: important

except for guest players who explicitly turned over their pc to the dm, where dm_owner can be the correct dm


[1/15/2025 3:11 PM] .deciusmus
so say looking at my 3 ausson's crossing pcs, it should probably be no tag (Izar), and stub on the other two


[1/15/2025 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2025 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
hrm, here's one - Caulaus


[1/15/2025 3:15 PM] .deciusmus
the page is fine, but there is some worthwhile information in email that would be good to migrate to discord. I guess it is dm_notes: color?


[1/15/2025 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
rather than needswork?


[1/15/2025 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2025 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
and Artem would be dm_notes: important, dm_owner: shared


[1/15/2025 3:16 PM] .deciusmus
say?


[1/15/2025 3:16 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2025 3:17 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm putting all the kestavo pages as status/needswork/old

{Reactions}
👍

[1/15/2025 3:17 PM] .deciusmus
Caulaus would be dm_owner: none (as opposed to Artem) because I don't actually care about him in the same way. Or should I set you as dm owner?


[1/15/2025 3:18 PM] rsulfuratus
he actually will likely resurface shortly. put dm_owner: tim for now


[1/15/2025 3:20 PM] .deciusmus
ok, I gotta focus on work for a bit but I think I got most of "my" pages with status/needswork/external or status/needswork/wip  to something more sensible

{Reactions}
👍

[1/15/2025 3:21 PM] rsulfuratus
I think the check stuff is all cleaned up now too. will tackle status/needswork now. no one has shown up to office hours


[1/15/2025 3:26 PM] .deciusmus
honestly a very useful thing to do with be for you to set dm_owner where it is missing


[1/15/2025 3:26 PM] rsulfuratus
also working on that


[1/15/2025 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
cleaning up a few check/mike's....

What is the right way to capture "I have a few thoughts on color, but nothing recorded, and nothing that I care that much about"


[1/15/2025 5:15 PM] .deciusmus
dm_owner: none, dm_notes: color?


[1/15/2025 5:15 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/15/2025 5:17 PM] .deciusmus
a page where 
(a) I have made up important details in game
(b) I would like to have a better page
(c) the existing minimal info on the page is correct

dm_ower:mike, dm_notes: important, status/cleanup/text?


[1/15/2025 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
status/cleanup/text vs status/stub is a fairly arbitrary line, i think up to the author which is a better vibe


[1/15/2025 5:18 PM] rsulfuratus
i guess maybe most important decision is if you want minimal information on page published or not


[1/15/2025 5:18 PM] .deciusmus
in this case (the Duchy of Wisford) I'd like the page to be published

{Reactions}
👍

[1/15/2025 5:26 PM] .deciusmus
what about:
(a) I have made up important details as part of creation of history
(b) that might not be super well documented in Obisidian
(c) but I'm not sure how much it matters if they are canonical as they haven't really come up in game
(d) but I like the details, at least as a starting point

is that dm_owner: none, dm_notes: important?


[1/15/2025 5:28 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, i think in general "dm_notes: important / dm_owner: none" is a fairly clear signal of that kind of vibe


[1/15/2025 5:29 PM] rsulfuratus
that kind of thing is probably a fairly high priority to copy as a comment to the note in question, fwiw


[1/15/2025 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
Zimkova is an interesting page...

there is lots of details we've discussed few of which are incorporated into the page, but at the same time, nothing on the page is wrong per se, and nothing has come up in my game or my private notes


[1/15/2025 5:42 PM] .deciusmus
dm_ower: shared, dm_notes:important?


[1/15/2025 5:43 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think that makes sense.


[1/15/2025 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
my inclination is to lean against status/needswork unless the page really is bad to use, but the distinction between:

- no status
- status/cleanup
- status/stub

is a bit arbitrary


[1/15/2025 5:45 PM] rsulfuratus
capturing dm_owner: shared / dm_notes: important is the key thing to mark as "there are shared docs about this"


[1/15/2025 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
I agree with the cavaet that for places in particular that definitively exist with a name, getting rid of status/stub is valuable

{Reactions}
👍

[1/15/2025 5:46 PM] .deciusmus
as I see status/stub as basically "I'm not done making the initial page"


[1/15/2025 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
i have a decent number of things that are status/stub because i have a lot of DM notes so a one-sentence page is kind of misleading


[1/15/2025 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
the downside is those take a lot of time to clean up individually


[1/15/2025 5:47 PM] rsulfuratus
there are also things like sembara which I set as a stub because there is literally just a map in public text


[1/15/2025 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
but it would take a few hours to really make a solid page


[1/15/2025 5:48 PM] rsulfuratus
so maybe we need another tag for that


[1/15/2025 5:49 PM] rsulfuratus
or maybe that should actually be needswork


[1/15/2025 5:50 PM] rsulfuratus
Chardonian Empire is in the same boat


[1/15/2025 5:51 PM] rsulfuratus
current stubs with more than 20 backlinks:
```
File311    Folder    Backlinks
Humans    Species/Children of Divine Creation    380
Sembara    Gazetteer/Greater Sembara    207
Great War    Events/1500s    130
Chardonian Empire    Gazetteer/West Coast    62
Deno'qai    Groups/Cultures    39
Hkar    History/Pre-Downfall    26
Govir    People/Dunmari    22
Embry    Gazetteer/Greater Sembara    21
Ra'ghemdros    People/Other Nonhumans    20
```


[1/15/2025 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
ortant does a lot of work. Something like the page on the Chardonian Legion


[1/15/2025 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
oops


[1/15/2025 5:51 PM] .deciusmus
ignore that


[1/15/2025 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
I think that it is potentially worth having a tag for "project" pages


[1/15/2025 5:52 PM] .deciusmus
that is, a page like Sembara or Chardonian Empire that would take significant time and effort to write up, but that should be written up


[1/15/2025 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
but for something like the Great War, why is that status/stub?


[1/15/2025 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
I have a ton of notes


[1/15/2025 5:54 PM] rsulfuratus
But maybe doesn’t need to be


[1/15/2025 5:54 PM] .deciusmus
right, but isn;t dm_notes:important sufficient?


[1/15/2025 5:55 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah maybe. There are a handful of pages that were needswork that I moved to stub for now


[1/15/2025 5:56 PM] rsulfuratus
But probably will move out again once I look more closely


[1/15/2025 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
right, I mean transitorily, good to move to stub as a landing spot. I did the same with some needswork/wip


[1/15/2025 5:56 PM] .deciusmus
But I think it is highly valueable to turn stubs into non-stubs, and it should never need more than 10-15 minutes


[1/15/2025 5:57 PM] rsulfuratus
My order of operation is (1) fix needswork (2)  add dm front matter, (3) deal with stubs, (4)! Deal with update


[1/15/2025 6:00 PM] .deciusmus
I think a landing place for needswork and stubs that indicates: "this page is accurate but missing significant stuff and it deserves more work" is useful


[1/15/2025 6:01 PM] .deciusmus
Hkar is a good example.

Adding a single sentence like

Hkar is known as the possibly mythical place of creation of humanity, and humanities first homeland. It is said to have sunk during the [[Downfall]]

feels like it captures the essential info about hkar for a player in my game, for example


[1/15/2025 6:03 PM] .deciusmus
but obviously there is a ton of stuff about hkar in the "world-lore" in our heads (mostly yours) and in a lot of random other docs in obisidian, and a useful project would be to pull that together into a better page.

but I don't think Hkar should stay a stub until that project is done


[1/15/2025 6:03 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah something like a could use improvement tag


[1/15/2025 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
Maybe just cleanup/incomplete would be fine


[1/15/2025 6:05 PM] .deciusmus
I like that


[1/15/2025 6:05 PM] rsulfuratus
status/cleanup as a catch all for anything that someone wants to
Improve in some way is kind of nice actually


[1/15/2025 6:06 PM] rsulfuratus
Probably should also use cleanup/update when there are non-critical session updates and keep status/update for things like “Apollyon is dead now”


[1/15/2025 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/15/2025 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
status/update maybe is even wrong, maybe it is status/needswork/gameevents


[1/15/2025 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
vs status/cleanup/gameevents


[1/15/2025 6:07 PM] .deciusmus
(or update instead of gameevents)


[1/15/2025 6:07 PM] rsulfuratus
Yeah that right


[1/15/2025 6:29 PM] rsulfuratus
adding `status/needswork/continuity` for things that have the right vibes but might have continuity errors and should not be relied on. could have this as `status/check/continuity` instead, don't have strong feelings


[1/15/2025 6:59 PM] rsulfuratus
`status/update` now just has PCs, which might need a new status home? created some more `status/check/mike`


[1/15/2025 7:00 PM] rsulfuratus
right now have:
- 102 check
- 226 cleanup
- 70 needswork
- 320 stub
- 10 update (PCs)


[1/15/2025 7:00 PM] rsulfuratus
going to try to remove stubs first if there are easy ones, and do dm_notes, and then maybe look at check/cleanup


[1/15/2025 7:31 PM] .deciusmus
I am not sure that PCs need special treatment


[1/15/2025 7:34 PM] .deciusmus
That is, isn't dm_owner: player, dm_notes: important doing all the work? If the PC is in an active game, one of us is running the game, and can change the status to status/needswork/gameupdate if needed.


[1/15/2025 7:35 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i guess i just need to think a little about how i actually use pc pages


[1/15/2025 7:36 PM] .deciusmus
maybe status/active is good for PC pages that are actively being played for right now


[1/15/2025 7:36 PM] .deciusmus
the biggest value is actually distinguishing between PC pages that are "historical" or where the game is over or otherwise potentially more npc-like, vs those that are active PCs


[1/15/2025 7:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i like taht


[1/15/2025 7:36 PM] rsulfuratus
*that


[1/15/2025 7:37 PM] .deciusmus
honestly, status/active isn't crazy for major NPCs either. For example Odo Cordorwaner is a pretty active NPC who has a character sheet and comes along with the party sometimes


[1/15/2025 7:55 PM] rsulfuratus
made this change and pushed


[1/15/2025 7:56 PM] rsulfuratus
going to try to clean up stubs for a bit to reduce the number


[1/15/2025 7:57 PM] .deciusmus
just pushed some status/mike fixes


[1/15/2025 8:04 PM] .deciusmus
what is your thought on event pages for "minor" events? i.e. the spider attack page


[1/15/2025 8:04 PM] .deciusmus
better to just link into session notes?


[1/15/2025 8:06 PM] rsulfuratus
i think event pages are most useful for things that either would gather a lot of backlinks and are central enough to write a narrative that is more general, or span multiple sessions


[1/15/2025 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
for Dunmar Campaign I have mostly only made event pages for multi-session things, and that highly inconsistently


[1/15/2025 8:07 PM] rsulfuratus
but, e.g. The Battle for Uzgukar despite <1 session is worth having imo


[1/15/2025 8:08 PM] .deciusmus
separate question: a page like Jaques Bellemont (the duke of wisford) is quite light on details, but the 2 sentences that are there are fine. I wrote the page before he came up in play and now there is a lot more world info about him


[1/15/2025 8:09 PM] .deciusmus
I had the tag as status/update, but is it better to just do no status and dm_notes: important?


[1/15/2025 8:10 PM] .deciusmus
I think yes, right?


[1/15/2025 8:11 PM] rsulfuratus
for context, i put:
- Fausto -> status/needswork/gameupate
- Casian -> status/cleanup/gameupdate
- Kaeso -> no status (well, metadata cleanup), dm_notes: important


[1/15/2025 8:12 PM] rsulfuratus
my logic is basically:
- Fausto's death is a major world event and upends a lot of things in Chardon, and I want to capture that
- Casian needs a bit of text cleanup to make the note properly reflect his last adventure and death but doesn't really affect his usability and he has a died frontmatter
- Kaeso although developed a lot is really still just a "minor but relevant Dunmar Frontier NPC"


[1/15/2025 8:14 PM] rsulfuratus
but i think it is always going to be a judgement call for the page author,


[1/15/2025 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/15/2025 8:15 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not totally sure what the different between cleanup/gameupdate and dm_notes: important is


[1/15/2025 8:18 PM] rsulfuratus
I mean I have several pages with both


[1/15/2025 8:19 PM] rsulfuratus
status/cleanup can be kind of a task list, doesn’t have to be controlled completely. For me cleanup/gameupdate is mostly for notes I wrote and then events changed context and I want to remember to update the note


[1/15/2025 8:20 PM] rsulfuratus
Whereas dm_notes: important might not be a high priority to update


[1/15/2025 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
pushed a bunch of status/mike cleanups


[1/15/2025 8:41 PM] .deciusmus
I'm looking at status/needswork/shared and moving to status/cleanup/incomplete when the only reason it seems to be needs work is because it doesn't feel like enough for the important of the page

{Reactions}
👍

[1/15/2025 8:48 PM] rsulfuratus
there probably aren't too many of those but worth looking


[1/15/2025 8:53 PM] .deciusmus
for exmaple, Istabor Alliance


[1/15/2025 8:54 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not convinced what is written there is canonical, fwiw


[1/15/2025 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
there was a lot of interesting discussion about isingue that hasn't propagated through the pre-Great-War politics of that area


[1/15/2025 8:55 PM] rsulfuratus
e.g., was it an alliance of city-states?


[1/15/2025 8:55 PM] .deciusmus
I guess maybe not


[1/15/2025 8:56 PM] rsulfuratus
we talked about kind of new england style governance and to me it feels like it might be more of a alliance as in Commonwealth than  as in "ancient Greek" or whatever the classic "group of city-states" is


[1/15/2025 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
true


[1/15/2025 8:56 PM] .deciusmus
maybe that's a bad example


[1/15/2025 8:57 PM] .deciusmus
a better example might be Treaty of Tyrwingha


[1/15/2025 8:58 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that could be just considered incomplete


[1/15/2025 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
that page is
(a) accurate if light
(b) has lots of off-page info and discussion


[1/15/2025 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
(c) the off-page info is all shared


[1/15/2025 8:58 PM] .deciusmus
(d) I have lots going on with Ethlenn so flagged it as dm_owner: mike even though it is kinda a shared event


[1/15/2025 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
but it is actually hard to capture the right status


[1/15/2025 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
actually - side note - i kind of need to know what is going on with Ethlenn at the moment


[1/15/2025 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
for dunmar feywild arch or your addermarch game?


[1/15/2025 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
particularly this: "Although Ethlenn herself has not been seen or heard for generations"


[1/15/2025 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
which moment


[1/15/2025 8:59 PM] rsulfuratus
is that true?


[1/15/2025 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
Ah


[1/15/2025 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
for Dunmar / feywild politics in 1749


[1/15/2025 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
what note is that in?


[1/15/2025 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
treaty of tyrwingha


[1/15/2025 9:00 PM] .deciusmus
ah thats in the %% bit


[1/15/2025 9:00 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/15/2025 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
i wouldn't set it is cleanup/incomplete if there is dubiously canonical information even in the comments


[1/15/2025 9:01 PM] rsulfuratus
unless it is clearly indicated as "not necessarily canon"


[1/15/2025 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
right, I missed that


[1/15/2025 9:01 PM] .deciusmus
that is not canonical


[1/15/2025 9:02 PM] .deciusmus
the vibe I'm going for is...

She obviously appeared and walked around and was very public about it around the time of Derik I's ascention to the throne and the founding of modern sembara


[1/15/2025 9:03 PM] .deciusmus
and probably or likely appeared one or two other times in the early blood years but haven't defined that


[1/15/2025 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
but in the last 100ish years she hasn't announced herself and paraded around Talofwern and held court


[1/15/2025 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
but it isn't like she is hidden or has not ever appeared to anyone


[1/15/2025 9:04 PM] rsulfuratus
but there are obviously plenty of fey that go back and forth, it isn't like she is hidden _in the feywild_, just doesn't really come to the material plane often


[1/15/2025 9:04 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/15/2025 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah, she holds court in Twilight's Grace all the time


[1/15/2025 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
and is not hidden at all


[1/15/2025 9:05 PM] .deciusmus
all the fey would have seen her, no problem


[1/15/2025 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
separately, my impression has always been that -- for reasons undetermined -- she has a small domain with strict borders that she maintains (and is perhaps unusually strong for the size of her domain - not that those necessarily correlate), but her domain has never really shrunk/grown much in a long long time


[1/15/2025 9:06 PM] .deciusmus
yes definitely


[1/15/2025 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
what is your take on her role in wider feywild politics. e.g., there is this unknown "bad fey place"  (Sharpspire) in the sentinels that leads to occasional strained cooperation between shimmersong and duskmire


[1/15/2025 9:08 PM] rsulfuratus
what does ethlenn think of that? does she go to the "Archfey parties" so to speak? (probably not real parties - but for example the Chanceweaver had people from Shimmersong at his court)


[1/15/2025 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
I don't think she ever leaves Twilight's Grace


[1/15/2025 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
except - rarely and not in a long time - to go to Tyrwingha


[1/15/2025 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
And I think she is somewhat unconcened with what happens outside her borders, although not *entirely* unconcerned. But I think she is more concerned with what happens in the mortal world than the feywild


[1/15/2025 9:10 PM] rsulfuratus
how about Umbreath? he has obviously expanded some into Amberglow territory, or at least what used to be minor realms associated with Amberglow, and he is at least concerned enough with his western borders to cooperate with Shimmersong

There is this idea of the Twilight Court, which is noted as unclear canon, but happy for it to exist if it is a relevant idea, which is imagined as a huge party she throws every 25 years or old, inviting all the powerful fey, that is elegant and fancy


[1/15/2025 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
Umbreath would totally travel anywhere he is invited; he was originally a master of games and ceremonies and craves glamor


[1/15/2025 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
i think an interesting vibe for that would be for it to be kind of neutral ground. Ethlenn doesn't do feywild politics, so all the other archfey find her parties a safe place to do their own politicking


[1/15/2025 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
He is also ambitious and would love to build something to rival Ethlenn's domain


[1/15/2025 9:11 PM] .deciusmus
yeah, I was envisioning something like that


[1/15/2025 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
when was the last Twilight Court in your game?


[1/15/2025 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
or unclear?


[1/15/2025 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
does it matter?


[1/15/2025 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
unclear


[1/15/2025 9:12 PM] .deciusmus
but if you want one in dunmar, grab it


[1/15/2025 9:13 PM] .deciusmus
doesn't matter and in fact the timing is pretty good


[1/15/2025 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
i would definitely make Twilight Court canon. i think the feywild needs something like that and it is perfect for Ethlenn's vibe


[1/15/2025 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
I don't expect it is *exactly* every 25 years; 25 years before 1749 is 1724, which is close enough to my game I could plausibly have one, but also easily enough to say it was in 1718 or 1726 if needed


[1/15/2025 9:17 PM] rsulfuratus
separately: what to do for dm notes for things like Eastern Green Sea Region, where the page is basically a stub and I have dm notes for component pieces


[1/15/2025 9:20 PM] .deciusmus
I think if there is nothing important cross-regional Id say none


[1/15/2025 9:52 PM] rsulfuratus
dm_frontmatter for zimka? dm_owner: mike, dm_notes: ??


[1/15/2025 9:53 PM] rsulfuratus
last group w/o dm frontmatter


[1/15/2025 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
I don't have any particular dm notes


[1/15/2025 9:54 PM] .deciusmus
so - none


[1/15/2025 10:30 PM] .deciusmus
I'm about to go to bed, but I wonder if there is a better way than dm_notes: color to capture:
* this is a minor place in an active game, so the vibe is likely changing and shifting as the game plays, and that might not be fully updated here

Is that just dm_notes: color?

It makes it hard to ever "finish" adding color notes


[1/15/2025 10:34 PM] .deciusmus
An example here is Tavoise or Beury. The notes are pretty complete at the moment but color is constantly being added


[1/16/2025 7:52 AM] rsulfuratus
i'm aiming to finish adding dm_notes before considering other options. however, i think setting status/active could be a reasonable option for those pages


[1/16/2025 8:10 AM] rsulfuratus
fyi a much faster way to add dm_notes than the MoC pages is in search:
`-["dm_owner"] path:Gazetteer`


[1/16/2025 8:35 AM] rsulfuratus
23 files left in gazetteer that need dm frontmatter, mostly Sembara or Istaros so for you to set


[1/16/2025 9:27 AM] .deciusmus
cleaned up all but 3


[1/16/2025 10:24 AM] rsulfuratus
have nearly finished dm frontmatter for all pages, but need to take a break now to work briefly. another super-quiet day though so will do more later.  I 've been tagging dm frontmatter for essentially every page, as I think it can be helpful, although obviously Campaigns is silly. a few notes incoming


[1/16/2025 10:27 AM] rsulfuratus
(1) for big meta pages, I generally default to none/none, except for things like the world map (dm_owner: tim), and a few other places where i care about the text specifically

(2) for a lot of things (e.g., cosmology, time), the distinction between shared and none is a bit unclear. i have tried to used shared for things where there are active discussions about canon, none for things that are blank slates or settled. but may not have been perfectly consistent. fine to change things, just drop a check/tim

(3) i have actually been finding tagging dm_owner in worldbuilding can be pretty helpful. since these are all dm_notes, i am trying to tag dm_notes: none unless there are additional brainstorming docs elsewhere, or i haven't fully written down my thoughts. (High School Notes are the exception, of course)


[1/16/2025 10:28 AM] rsulfuratus
(4) I've been going fast to just get things tagged so a few things may shift, but i feel pretty close to having a fairly complete "state of taelgarverse" system in place. just want to try to clean up stubs next


[1/16/2025 10:29 AM] .deciusmus
I have a meeting, but my quick though is that we are missing a good way to capture pages where there is active shared worldbuilding that isn't captured in the obsidian note


[1/16/2025 10:29 AM] rsulfuratus
i've been using dm_owner: shared, dm_notes: important for that


[1/16/2025 10:30 AM] rsulfuratus
or status/needswork/shared if the page itself is a mess


[1/16/2025 10:30 AM] .deciusmus
(I have to go pay attention to a meeting but then I'm heading into the office for a lunch so might share some thoughts from the train)

[1/16/2025 11:20 AM] rsulfuratus
I probably have a few too many tim/important


[1/16/2025 11:28 AM] .deciusmus
Is setting dm owner on Worldbuilding/Brainstorming useful?


[1/16/2025 11:31 AM] .deciusmus
i guess maybe it is


[1/16/2025 11:33 AM] .deciusmus
any reason not to just delete empty stub pages in brainstorming?


[1/16/2025 11:40 AM] .deciusmus
any reason not to move high school notes to Campaigns/Great War?


[1/16/2025 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
empty stub pages in brainstorming should be deleted


[1/16/2025 11:42 AM] rsulfuratus
worldbuilding high school -> Campaigns/Great War is a good idea


[1/16/2025 11:43 AM] rsulfuratus
i was distracted, working on a bunch of dataview tables (w chatGPT, surprisingly knows dataview pretty well) to better get as some of the data quality stuff, e.g. counts of typeOf details by descriptive tag, etc


[1/16/2025 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
Ok I pushed a bunch of stuff


[1/16/2025 11:58 AM] .deciusmus
A few thoughts from the train…


[1/16/2025 12:01 PM] .deciusmus
I think we have a handful of things that the current system makes hard to track..


[1/16/2025 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
(A) pages where there is a lot of useful discussion outside of obsidian (either in old google docs or email or discord) where it would be valuable to just copy that in


[1/16/2025 12:03 PM] .deciusmus
Actually the above is really the only example


[1/16/2025 12:04 PM] .deciusmus
More broadly though it is hard to tell if dm notes is supposed to be a “work list” or just a fact about the page.


[1/16/2025 12:05 PM] .deciusmus
Ie does dm_notes: color imply an intention to record the color in the note? Or is it expected that it would stay color forever and at some point the color gets lost or forgotten and we decide who cares and change to none?


[1/16/2025 12:07 PM] rsulfuratus
for me, dm_notes means one of three things:
(1) I have ideas about this note I want to write down, but haven't
(2) I have external notes about this I want to copy, usually e.g. something like description or roleplaying notes for people from OneNote (if color), but occasionally images; for important this would obviously be more critical details
(3) I have DM notes in Obsidian I should clean up

I think (1) is by far the least common


[1/16/2025 12:08 PM] rsulfuratus
in my ideal world, all of this would be copied into the page itself, either as public text, shared comments, or a secret


[1/16/2025 12:09 PM] rsulfuratus
so from that point of view, dm_notes to me implies a task list. but realistically a lot of this is likely never to get done, so it isn't like status/cleanup/incomplete


[1/16/2025 12:10 PM] .deciusmus
Right. For me I often set “color” on people who have come up in play but where there is no notes about their personality in obsidian. But I’ve often just improvised that so I don’t have other notes to copy in


[1/16/2025 12:11 PM] rsulfuratus
sure, that would be (1) in some sense


[1/16/2025 12:11 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah.


[1/16/2025 12:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but i also set e.g. dm_notes: none on some people (e.g., the Strongbones, the halfling family that ran an inn in Tokra) that I'm sure I improvised something about two years ago but they weren't important enough to write anything down so, whatever


[1/16/2025 12:12 PM] .deciusmus
Right


[1/16/2025 12:16 PM] .deciusmus
I’m almost at the office… but I wonder mostly about the shared and none dm notes.


[1/16/2025 12:17 PM] .deciusmus
202 none/color seems like a lot for example


[1/16/2025 12:17 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that should probably be worked down


[1/16/2025 12:18 PM] rsulfuratus
there are a lot of none/color in People (106). a lot of those are people from early in the dunmar campaign i have notes on from onenote


[1/16/2025 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
but have no particular attachment or plans for the person


[1/16/2025 12:19 PM] .deciusmus
I just wonder two additional categories might be useful…

(A) discussions (name to be improved) which means that none of the dm notes are private and anyone who wants to dig through email discord etc and collate the notes on the page can flip to dm-notes: none


[1/16/2025 12:19 PM] rsulfuratus
most of those are pretty easy to just copy and paste my onenote note as a comment and set the dm_info -> none


[1/16/2025 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
(B) vibes-(campaign) (also name to be improved) which means the person or place came up enough in a game that there are some useful vibes or roleplaying notes that could be shared but they are not important and probably are not worth writing down, so ask, but the answer might be “ I forget “


[1/16/2025 12:21 PM] .deciusmus
But maybe (b) should just be none?


[1/16/2025 12:23 PM] rsulfuratus
it is very useful to me to keep dm_notes focused on "how critical is the missing information". i think discussions, in particular, obscures that, because it could be color discussions or important discussions


[1/16/2025 12:24 PM] rsulfuratus
vibes could be a useful gradient between none and color


[1/16/2025 12:25 PM] rsulfuratus
i have a meeting in 5 minutes and have to actually work until around 3 but will think on this a bit, might have more thoughts later.


[1/16/2025 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
it does seem like we want to capture:
(a) who, if anyone, has plans for something
(b) who, if anyone, has notes about something
(c) how critical are the notes


[1/16/2025 12:26 PM] rsulfuratus
it is really the (b) that is missing. e.g., there are things tagged dm_owner: shared that are really more "there are shared notes" not "we both have independent plans"


[1/16/2025 12:27 PM] rsulfuratus
in any case, more later


[1/16/2025 12:28 PM] .deciusmus
Right. I was just thinking something similar.


[1/16/2025 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
here is a proposal for an update to dm frontmatter, aiming to capture all three of the points above with two frontmatter items. 

dm_notes remains the same: none, color, or important
none = no information outside the page
color = non-critical information outside the page 
important = critical information outside the page

it is fairly easy to expand this with more levels if we want (e.g., vibes between none and color), but i'm not sure it is necessary

dm_owner gets overloaded to solve the issues with missing a way to capture "who has notes".  specifically:
- if the dm_owner is a campaign (clee, dufr, addermarch, etc), or a combination of campaigns, that implies "some kind of important context for the specific campaign"
- if the dm_owner is a person (tim, mike) or a combination of people (tim,mike), that implies "not active in a campaign but the person either (a) cares about the development of thing enough to want to be consulted, or (b) has unincorporated notes"
- if the dm_owner is shared, that implies "subject to active joint development" - note the contrast with, say tim,mike. shared = joint notes, tim,mike or clee,dufr = each of us has independent dm notes.
- if the dm_owner is none, implies no one has important future plans
- if the dm_owner is meta, it is like none but implies a certain degree of centrality to the page

in this setup, should not have dm_owner none or dm_owner meta unless dm_notes also is none. 

things that have color notes but no future plans should be dm_owner (name) and dm_notes color, for example. 

dm_owner shared should only be used when the dm_notes are shared; if we both have independent development should be dm_owner mike,tim. 

things could be dm_owner clee,tim for example, but ideally these should be rare.

not sure this is perfect but idea might be worth iterating on


[1/16/2025 1:42 PM] rsulfuratus
from current system, would require:


[1/16/2025 1:44 PM] rsulfuratus
(1) changing dm_owner (name) -> dm_owner (campaign)
(2) adding dm_owner (name) to notes with dm_owner none and dm_notes != none
(3) spending a little time reassigning dm_owner shared to either shared or some kind of combination
(4) spending a little time reassigning dm_owner none to dm_owner meta


[1/16/2025 2:48 PM] .deciusmus
I like the basic idea, but I wonder if the distinction between person and campaign is too much.


[1/16/2025 2:49 PM] .deciusmus
To start, I think shared vs mike,tim is a good way to distinguish between a shared page vs we both have notes


[1/16/2025 2:54 PM] .deciusmus
I'm less sure about the campaign stuff...


[1/16/2025 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
The basic problem I think is that it kinda breaks the goal of dm_owner originally.

If I see a page from Adderfell campaign with 

dm_owner: tim
dm_notes: color

Does that mean

(a) you have unincorporated color notes, but don't really care about the place/person 
OR


[1/16/2025 2:56 PM] .deciusmus
(b) you have unincorporated color notes and DO care about the place/person


[1/16/2025 2:58 PM] .deciusmus
I also like dm_owner: meta - it is a good way to track "big" pages and is a nice constrast with shared, i.e.

I would assume shared means = active conversations ongoing, or active conversations have happened in the past and are not incorporated in the notes
meta means = restarting active development of this page probably needs at least a check/(other), but there is nothing active right now


[1/16/2025 2:59 PM] .deciusmus
and a dm_owner: shared could go from shared -> meta or shared -> none depending on the centrality of the page


[1/16/2025 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
my suggestion would be, to start:

* review shared and move to mike,tim where correct
* review none to tag meta where correct
* review dm_owner none / dm_notes != none for cases where the right thing is shared (i.e. the notes are all shared)


[1/16/2025 3:04 PM] .deciusmus
Then re-review and see if adding a campaign flag vs a person flag makes sense


[1/16/2025 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, maybe the campaign stuff is too much


[1/16/2025 3:06 PM] .deciusmus
I'm not sure exactly, but it seems nicer to clean up dm_owner = none / dm_notes != none and dm_owner = shared first, and than look at what is left in the dm_owner = none, dm_notes != none


[1/16/2025 3:06 PM] rsulfuratus
right


[1/16/2025 3:07 PM] .deciusmus
I think there might be some value in a way to flag this as "i have notes but I don't care about the future of this page"


[1/16/2025 3:07 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah but might not need frontmatter. dm_owner = none, dm_notes = color could just be handled with a comment


[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
but I also think that for notes = important, that is probably wrong. If you or I have important notes, it is probably wrong to not have dm_owner set - no one can use the page meaningfully as more than vague background without talking to the owner


[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
(except for the dm_owner: shared as per above)


[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
only 36 pages with that configuration


[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] .deciusmus
so then we are left with none / color and the question becomes is it really worth caring about none/color


[1/16/2025 3:08 PM] rsulfuratus
of which 10 are needswork/stub/check


[1/16/2025 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
i


[1/16/2025 3:09 PM] .deciusmus
I'm in the office and have to go to a meeting but when I'm home I might look at the none/color to see what is there. I think I flagged a lot of stuff none/color


[1/16/2025 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
these are none/important
Divine Presence    complete

[1/16/2025 3:11 PM] rsulfuratus
(excluding stub, needswork, check)


[1/16/2025 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
it is kind of a random bunch of things. i think a lot of pages where i have a secret that doesn't need to be secret anymore (e.g., Badya, Theba, Kisa, Godfrey of Marburgh)


[1/16/2025 3:12 PM] rsulfuratus
those are easy to clean up


[1/16/2025 4:18 PM] .deciusmus
Ok, a few thoughts from the train back home…


[1/16/2025 4:23 PM] .deciusmus
What about reversing the meaning of a campaign dm owner, so that there are the following:

(a) a campaign. The page was or is used in a campaign, and there is some information that came up in game (or in game prep) that isn’t incorporated - but the DM of that game has no further plans for the page. 
(b) person - private information exists and the person has plans 
(C) shared - all dm notes are shared 
(D) meta - the page is of broad important and is probably more a joint creation


[1/16/2025 4:25 PM] .deciusmus
These can be combined, ie you could have 

The Wyrdling
dm_notes: important 
dm_owner: meta, clee 

That implies something important about the wyrdling came up in my game, and that major changes to the wyrdling should be pre-discussed


[1/16/2025 4:26 PM] .deciusmus
dm_owner: shared, meta

On the other hand would imply that the important notes were in discord


[1/16/2025 4:27 PM] .deciusmus
Not sure though


[1/16/2025 4:28 PM] .deciusmus
Maybe forget the meta and shared stuff. But use owner = campaign as a shorthand for “the only notes are what I used in game”? Is that worth a special case?


[1/16/2025 4:31 PM] rsulfuratus
i'm not convinced that the campaign part is useful, as opposed to dm_owner: none, dm_notes: color, and a comment with relevant info


[1/16/2025 4:32 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that your suggestion at 3:04 pm is still the right way to start


[1/16/2025 4:34 PM] rsulfuratus
basically:
- name: that person or people has plans
- shared: ongoing joint discussion
- meta: central enough to be careful with major revisions (good for e.g. religions, world region pages)
- none: no plans, not central


[1/16/2025 4:34 PM] .deciusmus
Yeah I agree


[1/16/2025 4:36 PM] .deciusmus
I do think it is completely reasonable, if the only “missing info” from the page is from in game events, to tag status/needswork/gameupdate or status/cleanup/gameupdate and set dm_notes to none


[1/16/2025 4:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah that makes sense


[1/16/2025 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed some MoC updates that should hopefully make sorting through things easier


[1/16/2025 5:11 PM] rsulfuratus
will do some more cleanup later tonight, going to Nathaniel's winter concert now


[1/16/2025 8:32 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at shared dm_owner.  I think the only ones that are really actually mike,tim (as opposed to shared or meta) are:
- amberglow
- duskmire
- twilight's grace
- twilight court
- mostreve hills
- the rangers
- de brunes
- dominion of avatus
- vahaiya
- pyravela

maybe worth adding:
- addermarch
- tyrwingha


[1/16/2025 8:32 PM] .deciusmus
that seems right


[1/16/2025 8:33 PM] .deciusmus
I think Tyrwinghan and Addermarch are probably shared/meta


[1/16/2025 8:34 PM] .deciusmus
A few odd ones:

Abelard
Armand
Artem Novolozek


[1/16/2025 8:35 PM] rsulfuratus
those are all basically joint inventions and i wasn't sure all the notes were captured


[1/16/2025 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
artem for sure has a bunch of details that are missing


[1/16/2025 8:36 PM] .deciusmus
Actually, isn't shared meant to imply there are no private notes?


[1/16/2025 8:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yes, i don't think there are private notes for any of those. armand backstory is all in discord, artem in email. abelard less certain but i think email


[1/16/2025 8:37 PM] .deciusmus
I went through all the emails I could find, btw, and tagged them so I can pull them in


[1/16/2025 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
Do you think having raw copies of email threads in obsidian is valuable?


[1/16/2025 8:38 PM] rsulfuratus
yes


[1/16/2025 8:38 PM] .deciusmus
I mean, in worldbuilding or comments only, to be a source of stuff to mine and then delete


[1/16/2025 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
For Abelard, all I have on notes that isn't in obsidian is an image, which I am adding. Is it fair to say that for a page with dm_owner: shared if I add in all the emails or discord info I can find, it should become dm_owner: none, dm_notes: none?


[1/16/2025 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
(maybe with a check/tim)


[1/16/2025 8:40 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah, i think that is correct


[1/16/2025 8:40 PM] .deciusmus
for some larger pages, maybe meta / none rather than none/none


[1/16/2025 8:42 PM] rsulfuratus
i think in general there is no reason to have a shared / none category, since the main point of shared is a way to mark "this is something that we have shared notes not captured, but it isn't central to the world or anyone's campaign"


[1/16/2025 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/16/2025 8:42 PM] .deciusmus
agreed

the only question is for things that have both ongoing discussion and some private notes (e.g., i made up a fair bit of mos numena backstory for the circular island that isn't incorporated yet), what do we tag them?


[1/16/2025 8:43 PM] rsulfuratus
is that meta,tim?
just meta?


[1/16/2025 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
I think meta,tim


[1/16/2025 8:45 PM] .deciusmus
or shared,tim if there are active discussions that need to be pulled into obsidian (i.e. emails or discord or whatever)


[1/16/2025 8:46 PM] .deciusmus
although I'm not sure about that second one


[1/16/2025 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
there are now only 91 shared notes after I moved the ones above to mike,tim

i might just take 10 minutes and change them to shared,tim if I do have private notes then push, and you can do the same.

then we'd have:
shared
shared,tim
shared,mike
shared,tim,mike

should be easy to sort from there


[1/16/2025 8:49 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/16/2025 8:49 PM] rsulfuratus
then i think anything that is meta-relevant gets changed from [shared, none] -> meta


[1/16/2025 8:51 PM] .deciusmus
are you fixing now? we shouldn't do it at the same time or we will have conflicts


[1/16/2025 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah i'm doing it now


[1/16/2025 8:52 PM] rsulfuratus
give me five more minutes


[1/16/2025 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed


[1/16/2025 9:05 PM] rsulfuratus
MoC broken now but this search should still get shared pages:
`["dm_owner":"shared"]`


[1/16/2025 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
pushed MoC update


[1/16/2025 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
wyrdling is dm owner tim whereas most gods are shared


[1/16/2025 9:15 PM] .deciusmus
is there a reason for that?


[1/16/2025 9:15 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that is probably just a copy-paste mistake


[1/16/2025 9:16 PM] rsulfuratus
you should change that, i do have a few random color notes so put shared,tim for now plus whatever you have


[1/16/2025 9:18 PM] .deciusmus
ok I pushed my updates


[1/16/2025 9:21 PM] .deciusmus
I'm changing dm_owner: shared / dm_notes none to meta mostly


[1/16/2025 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
Highland Conquest Wars? Is that really worth meta?


[1/16/2025 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
I might just put it as none


[1/16/2025 9:22 PM] rsulfuratus
i think that is shared because we have some discussion about it?


[1/16/2025 9:22 PM] .deciusmus
yeah the notes shouldn't be none you are right


[1/16/2025 9:24 PM] rsulfuratus
looking at the "just shared" stuff there are a handful mistagged with dm_notes: none that do have dm_notes, and then basically three categories:
- joint inventions for a game (e.g., armand, abelard) where it should be easy to just grab the notes and set to none/none
- ongoing discussion (mostly sembaran history and elven stuff and deep world history)
- meta stuff (gods, religions, species)


[1/16/2025 9:24 PM] .deciusmus
A Story about Halfing Merchants? That probably doesn't need a DM owner


[1/16/2025 9:25 PM] rsulfuratus
no, that should be none/none


[1/16/2025 9:26 PM] rsulfuratus
sylvan writing as well i think all the discussion is captured by the note


[1/16/2025 9:26 PM] .deciusmus
yes


[1/16/2025 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
ok I cleaned up, Undead ? It is shared,tim / none


[1/16/2025 9:27 PM] .deciusmus
do you actually have notes? I don't think there was much shared dscussion


[1/16/2025 9:27 PM] rsulfuratus
i have some notes, that shouldn't be none


[1/16/2025 9:28 PM] .deciusmus
i assume it should be important


[1/16/2025 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah


[1/16/2025 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
probably i tagged shared meaning "meta" and didn't remember to update notes to important


[1/16/2025 9:28 PM] rsulfuratus
if you push i can look at changes


[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
and see what is left


[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] rsulfuratus
did you add meta?


[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
ya to a few


[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
one sec


[1/16/2025 9:29 PM] .deciusmus
needed to go plug i my laptop


[1/16/2025 9:30 PM] .deciusmus
I pushing a change that sets the following to meta/none:

* Aldanor
* Region Map
* a few random brainstorming pages that are themselves dumps of notes


[1/16/2025 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
and fixes notes: none for a few other shared pages, and sets a couple to none/none (either discussed above or with status/tim)


[1/16/2025 9:31 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, i'm pulling now


[1/16/2025 9:31 PM] .deciusmus
pushed


[1/16/2025 9:33 PM] rsulfuratus
for the remaining shared notes, i think i would change all playable species to meta by default, regardless.

as well as kestavo, tanshi, and mos numena main pages, and mos numena gods


[1/16/2025 9:34 PM] .deciusmus
yes, although some of those might have shared discussions to capture, right?


[1/16/2025 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
although actually i'm now wondering about meta - because for example i think the Chardonian Empire, although "meta", is probably not really "meta" in the sense that i'm developing in relatively in isolation. same with dunmar


[1/16/2025 9:34 PM] rsulfuratus
compared to say addermarch


[1/16/2025 9:35 PM] rsulfuratus
so i think meta doesn't really mean meta, it just means "automatically relevant to multiple campaigns"


[1/16/2025 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
joint?


[1/16/2025 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
I actually wonder if it is better to have a *tag* for shared notes to import


[1/16/2025 9:35 PM] .deciusmus
rather than a dm_owner


[1/16/2025 9:36 PM] rsulfuratus
yeah maybe that is better. status/external perhaps


[1/16/2025 9:36 PM] .deciusmus
or status/check/external


[1/16/2025 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i was actually thinking about splitting status. 

in a lot of the MoC stuff, i find myself wanting to do: active, stub, needswork, check, complete


[1/16/2025 9:37 PM] rsulfuratus
i would consider "look for external notes" to be more like "cleanup/incomplete" than "check" as it doesn't imply anything wrong with existing text


[1/16/2025 9:37 PM] .deciusmus
right


[1/16/2025 9:38 PM] rsulfuratus
we don't have cleanup/external, so could just use that


[1/16/2025 9:39 PM] rsulfuratus
i don't actually want to add another top-level status tag as i'd have to fix all the dataview


[1/16/2025 9:40 PM] .deciusmus
sure


[1/16/2025 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure how much more i'm going to do tonight but i think the key "joint" things would be:
- general feywild stuff (fey, feywild pages mostly)
- languages & playable species
- large-scale sembaran history 
- addermarch / tyrwingha / sembara top-level pages but not lower-level pages
- elven stuff
- deno'qai stuff


[1/16/2025 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
(oh plus mos numena)


[1/16/2025 9:45 PM] .deciusmus
yeah that sounds right; plus kestavo and zimka unless you are leaving that as just mike


[1/16/2025 9:45 PM] rsulfuratus
zimka i think is more you


[1/16/2025 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
kestavo i guess to the extent it plays into the larger "northern folk religions"


[1/16/2025 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
I'm going to go watch a show with Dana; but I actually think if we had

(a) cleanup/external to mean there are external notes to find and copy in
(b) dm_owner: joint to mean we are developing the page together
(c) dm_owner: mike, tim to mean we are developing separately but want to coordinate

It would be fairly clear. 

dm_owner: none then means either (a) the page is done and you have no further plans or (b) the page is not done but no one has plans.


[1/16/2025 9:46 PM] rsulfuratus
but maybe better to just tag the "northern folk religions" page as joint


[1/16/2025 9:46 PM] .deciusmus
yeah


[1/16/2025 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
okay, i am going to spend 20 minutes or so on this, maybe more depending on how sucked in i get


[1/16/2025 9:47 PM] rsulfuratus
there will probably be another round of cleanup / check/mike stuff, i'll tag you if i'm not certain (can also look at commit history)

{Reactions}
👍

[1/16/2025 9:53 PM] .deciusmus
One thought  - dm owner is basically who is developing the incomplete page which is good. That means dm owner none / dm notes is basically a page you are “done with” but never finished, which is kinda fine and a decent way to think about it.


[1/16/2025 9:55 PM] rsulfuratus
right. in my case at least the dm_owner: none / dm_notes: important are pages i'd like to finish and probably should finish. but yes i think that is a good interpretation

{Reactions}
👍

[1/17/2025 8:42 AM] rsulfuratus
pushed a bunch of stuff last night and this morning. i have a bunch of scattered 30 minute meetings today so probably won't be particularly coherent for extended discussion but will likely be slowly working on note cleanup throughout the day. will try to pull before doing any editing and push before going back to a meeting so as to avoid merge conflicts. my main goal is to turn everything that is shared,tim into joint or none depending on context, so those are the main notes i'll work on


[1/17/2025 8:44 AM] rsulfuratus
my general interpretation has been that dm_notes should be used for private/non-shared notes, and if the only notes are shared, i've been setting dm_notes: none and status/cleanup/external


[1/17/2025 8:50 AM] .deciusmus
to the extent I'm doing stuff today I'm trying to pull in emails


[1/17/2025 9:29 AM] .deciusmus
I don't think I will update status much


[1/17/2025 10:03 AM] rsulfuratus
doing a bit of cleanup of mos numena gods - Kiya has really done a lot of nice worldbuilding around ordinary people's experience of the divine. 

it would be nice to perhaps pick a few of those stories to share as sources in primary sources, with her permission.


[1/17/2025 10:08 AM] .deciusmus
I’ll ask her. She was happy for me to publish them on my version of taelgarverse
