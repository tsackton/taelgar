## Actions
**Polymorph**. Areschera can innately shapeshift into any beast or human form as an action, and maintain that form indefinitely without requiring concentration. Her magic depends on verbal spoken Sylvan, and cannot be used in forms that do not have the ability to speak. 

***Innate Magic***
Spell Attack +8, Save DC 16

Areschera can cast the following spells at will: Suggestion, Command, Charm Person, Silvery Barbs

She can cast the following spells using her spell slots, of which she has 3 3rd level, 4 2nd level, and 4 1st level.
* 1st Level: Shield, Bane, Dissonant Whispers, Sleep
* 2nd Level: Invisibility, Mirror Image, Tasha's Mind Whip, Phantasmal Force, Misty Step
* 3rd Level: Antagonize, Hypnotic Pattern

She can cast the following spells once per day:
* Compulsion
* Mass Suggestion
* Mislead

***Aura of Compulsion***
Areschera can emanate an aura of terrifying regal presence. This can be created with a bonus action and does not require concentration. Areschera can only generate this aura in her true form. The aura forces anyone who starts their turn within 10 feet, or comes within 10 feet, to make DC 16 WIS save. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 psychic damage and falls Prone. Areschera can also choose to push the creature 10 feet away. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage only and is immune to the aura for 24 hours.
### Items
**Gem of Spell Storing** (requires attunement).
This gem can store up to 3 levels of spells. A stored spell can be cast without using a spell slot.
A spell can be stored by casting it, at which point the gem captures the spell. If you are the only target of a spell, and you make the saving throw, you can choose to store the spell. If you counter a spell, via Counterspell or similar magic, you can store the spell as part of the casting of counterspell. Alternatively, you can use your reaction to make an Arcana check (DC = 12 + level of spell). If you succeed you can store the spell.

*Currently has Counterspell stored*

**Braces of Protection**
These bracers grant you an AC of 12.

**Red Rose**
This delicate red rose sparkles with a fiery light and gives off a small amount of heat. It can be pinned to a shirt or held in the hand, and well held or otherwise attached, grants the wearer resistance to fire damage. If the bearer takes more than 10 points of fire damage (after applying the resistance) the flower disintegrates and the bearer takes no damage. As an action, the rose can be thrown up to 30 feet, where it explodes, doing 6d6 fire damage to everyone within a 10 foot radius (DC 13 DEX save for half).

**Wand of Witch's Blast**
This wand has 7 charges, and regains 1d6+1 charges each dawn. A charge can be expended to fire a crackling blast of cursed lightening to a target, which is a ranged spell attack at +4 to hit. On a hit, this does 2d12 damage and leaves a shimmering curse on the target. This curse remains for one minute, or until the wand is used again, it is dispelled (with Dispel Magic or Remove Curse), or until the target is out of sight or behind total cover from the user. While this curse remains on a target, the wearer can use a bonus action to do 1d12 damage to the target. For each additional charge expended, the initial damage increases by 1d12, up to a maximum of 5d12 (by expending 4 charges).

If the wand is attuned by a spellcaster, it uses the spellcaster's spell attack. 

**Brooch of Veiling**
Any spell that would detect your thoughts or your creature type appears to work, but gives you innocuousness results. This brooch does not detect as magic.


In a chest in her room is a couple of other items:
* 5 packets of dust: 1 choking and sneezing, 1 pixie, 1 disappearance, 1 deliciousness, 1 revealing
* Gem of Augury 
* Mirror of scrying a specific location with a specific command word that identity wont reveal
* Potion of Clairvoyance, Potion of Mind Reading, Potion of Poison, Potion of Greater Healing
### Bonus Actions
**Vicious Mockery**. Areschera can cast the Vicious Mockery cantrip as a bonus action. (Spell attack +8, 2d6 damage)
**Voice of Command**. One creature within range must succeed on a DC 16 WIS saving throw or be charmed. A faintly rope of silver and gold springs from Areschera and binds itself around the target. The target is forced to make a melee attack against a creature Areschera chooses on its next turn, other than itself. It must do so before moving. The effect then ends.
### Reactions

### Immunities
Areschera is immune to being charmed or frightened. She has resistance to psychic damage.

### Free Actions
**Friends**. Areschera can cast the ***Friends*** cantrip at will, merely by talking. When she casts this spell, it does not require concentration, and lasts for an hour, and she can repeatedly target the same creature, as long as they have not made the save, which is DC 16 Wis.
