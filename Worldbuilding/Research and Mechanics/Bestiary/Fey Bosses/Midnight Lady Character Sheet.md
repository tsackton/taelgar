### Items

**Wand of Witch's Blast**
This wand has 7 charges, and regains 1d6+1 charges each dawn. A charge can be expended to fire a crackling blast of cursed lightening to a target, which is a ranged spell attack at +4 to hit. On a hit, this does 2d12 damage and leaves a shimmering curse on the target. This curse remains for one minute, or until the wand is used again, it is dispelled (with Dispel Magic or Remove Curse), or until the target is out of sight or behind total cover from the user. While this curse remains on a target, the wearer can use a bonus action to do 1d12 damage to the target. For each additional charge expended, the initial damage increases by 1d12, up to a maximum of 5d12 (by expending 4 charges).

If the wand is attuned by a spellcaster, it uses the spellcaster's spell attack. If all 7 charges are expended, the attack can target up to 7 creatures at once. 
### Immunities
The Midnight Lady is immune to being Charmed or Frightened. She has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage. 

## **The Root Cellar of the Widow’s House**

The root cellar beneath the Widow’s House is **larger than it should be**, its walls lined with **old stone and gnarled roots**. A damp, earthy smell fills the air, but underneath it is something **faintly sweet and rotten**—like fruit left to spoil.
#### **Key Features**

1. **The Mirror-Pool** _(The Hag’s Escape and Trickery)_
    - A large **shallow pool of black water** sits in the center of the room.
    - The hag can **step into the pool and emerge from any reflection in the room**, including the water itself, a silvered knife, or the sheen on a character’s armor.
    - Looking into the pool sometimes **shows the room as it was years ago**—a normal cellar, filled with barrels and sacks.
    
2. **The Hanging Roots** _(Movement Hazard & Battlefield Control)_
    - The ceiling is **low in places**, with **thick roots dangling down**.
    - Some roots **writhe on their own**, snagging weapons and tripping the unwary.
    - If **cut**, they **bleed thick, black sap** that hisses when it hits the ground.

### **Combat & Lair Actions**

The hag **doesn’t stand still**—she moves through reflections, **appearing and vanishing** unpredictably.

- **Shadowed Reflection:** On her turn, the hag can **disappear into the Mirror-Pool** and reappear **in any reflective surface in the room**.
- **Living Roots:** As a lair action, the hag can **command the roots to lash out**, pulling someone **prone or restraining them** for a turn.
- **Flickering Light:** The dim lanterns **sputter and flicker**, sometimes making **a reflection move when nothing else does**—a false warning, or a sign of danger.
