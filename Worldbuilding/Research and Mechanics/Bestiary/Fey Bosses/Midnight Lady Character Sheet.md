### Items

**Wand of Witch's Blast**
This wand has 7 charges, and regains 1d6+1 charges each dawn. A charge can be expended to fire a crackling blast of cursed lightening to a target, which is a ranged spell attack at +4 to hit. On a hit, this does 2d12 damage and leaves a shimmering curse on the target. This curse remains for one minute, or until the wand is used again, it is dispelled (with Dispel Magic or Remove Curse), or until the target is out of sight or behind total cover from the user. While this curse remains on a target, the wearer can use a bonus action to do 1d12 damage to the target. For each additional charge expended, the initial damage increases by 1d12, up to a maximum of 5d12 (by expending 4 charges).

If the wand is attuned by a spellcaster, it uses the spellcaster's spell attack. If all 7 charges are expended, the attack can target up to 7 creatures at once. 
### Immunities
The Midnight Lady is immune to being Charmed or Frightened. She has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.
