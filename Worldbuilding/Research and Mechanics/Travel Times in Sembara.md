This tries to outline some relatively realistic travel times across Sembara.

Broadly, it assumes one of five different types of travel:

* Messenger relay - a messenger using the crown or military dispatch systems, riding in stages and trading horses at waystations
* Horse relay - a lone traveler or small group (no more than 15-20) of travelers all mounted, with at least 2.5 horses for each person, who are trained riders and who switch between horses periodically
* Horse - a lone traveler or small group (no more than 15-20) of travelers, all mounted, but without change of horse
* Troop - a lone traveler or small group on foot, or a large group of disciplined travelers on foot or mounted
* Caravan - a large group of less disciplined travelers with wagons, or pack animals

These can be sustained for various periods of time:
* Messenger relay can be sustained indefinite distances and times, as long as traveling with the official messenger system
* Horse relay and horse can be sustained for about 3 days, after which either a full day of rest is required, or a change of horses. 
* Troop and caravan can be sustained indefinitely

In general, these represent "standard" times. Forced marches and extenuating circumstances (magical supplies, etc) can extend the time in a day by variable amounts.

In Sembara, there are also four types of road:

* Tracks: these are cart or foot tracks, usually undrained and dirt only, may or may not be maintained
* Baronial roads: these are minor public ways maintained by the baron, usually consisting of a wide cart path with a footpath on the side. The footpath is usually no better than a track, but the cart path is usually paved with gravel or cobblestones, and some attempt at drainage is made. However, these roads can vary widely in quality, and may have fallen into disrepair
* Royal roads: major roads that are maintained with a combination of royal and ducal funds. These are wide roads, with good drainage, footpaths on each side, and are paved with stone. Usually kept in good repair
* Great South Road: this road is in a class by itself, being built in Drankorian days with unknown magic.

Normal army message traffic is Dunfry - Ainwick - Embry, the Dunfry - Cleenseau route is really just South Watch business and some commericial business but it isn't a very popular route, so a bit slower

Distances:
Cleenseau - Dunfry: 110 miles - medium road
Dunfry - Dunmore: 120 miles - medium road (8)
Dunmore - Ainwick: 110 miles- medium road (8)
Dunfry - Enford: 60 miles - bad road

### From Champimont
You are in Champimont. Cleenseau is 30 miles to the west. Rinburg is 30 miles to the east. Fellburn is 80 miles east of Rinburg. The road (the Great South Road) is exceptionally good the whole way from Cleenseau to Fellburn.

Travel times, approximately are:

90 miles/day for the messenger system, with stationed horses every couple hours Pony Express style (but this has broken down somewhat recently)
65 miles/day for a horse relay, a small group of people with ~3 horses/person, riding hard
35 miles/day for a regular mounted person or small group, but without changes of horse
20 miles/day for a disciplined large group (foot or mounted, i.e. an army) or a lone person or small group on foot
15 miles/day for a caravans with wagons, or large undisciplined groups (i.e. refugees)

These are rough numbers, and would be much lower off the Great South Road. 

It is also only ~70 miles from Gowerboure to Fellburn, although on much less good roads.
