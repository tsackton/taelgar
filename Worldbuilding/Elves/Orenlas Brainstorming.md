Some notes mostly copied from chatGPT on [[Orenlas]]. Might be useful to mine. I think anything canon should be in the Orenlas note, or will be once I'm done cleaning up.

# Orenlas

Highly secretive kingdom: only Melindir and Elwis can really speak with authority. 

- Orenlas is the last remaining ancient forest of the vast elven kingdom of Alcarinque, which once stretched from what is now the western coast of Dunmar to the [[Green Sea]] (South Cymea area). While many of the ancient trees have died, here still can be found pockets of forest originally called into being by the footsteps of Aldanor, the living tree. 
- The forest is alive, in a way. The trees listen, and those who are unwelcome find paths closed to them, trees looming menacingly, and the brambled masses of the woods closing in. Eventually, most who would trespass find themselves always pushed to the edges of the forest. The ancient magics that once protected elven kingdoms in the age of creation and the early days of the world still live on in Orenlas in a way they do no where else in Taelgar.
- Orenlas still has a feeling of the Age of Creation about it, a sense of deep magic. 
- Most of the elves of Orenlas live in deep communion with the woods, and there are many strange things that can be found in the forests. The oldest elves often become almost tree-like themselves. 
- The great city of Erelion (air-lee-on), hidden in the center of Orenlas, is the oldest elven city in the world, founded by the first generation of elves to walk the earth. It is a wonder to behold, full of magic and light beneath the ancient trees of the forest. 
- The elves have no concept of kings and queens as mortals do, no concept of fealty and allegiance. Orenlas is ruled in a mystical way that Melindir and Elwis won't readily describe to outsiders.

chat GPT notes:

**Wisdom Trees:** In Erelion, the Wisdom Trees stand as ancient and revered [[Sentinel Range|sentinels]] of collective knowledge, their trunks intertwined with the very fabric of the forest's magic. Rather than serving as a vessel for ancestral memory, these trees store the combined wisdom of those living in the present. Elves of all generations gather beneath the shimmering foliage of these trees during pivotal moments, especially when important decisions must be made. This gathering forms a connection between the minds of all present elves, young and old, where they share their experiences and perspectives through the medium of dreams.

The ritual begins with the soft humming of wind chimes woven through the trees' branches, resonating with the gentle rhythms of Elmerca's magic. As the sun dips below the horizon, casting a tapestry of stars across the sky, the elves enter a collective trance, guided by the soothing songs of the forest's creatures.

During this ethereal state, the elves share fragments of their dreams, projected onto the leaves and branches of the Wisdom Trees. These dreams intermingle and weave a tapestry of insights, creating a profound understanding of the issue at hand. The trees' leaves might emit a gentle, silvery light, illuminating the space with an otherworldly glow.

As the trance reaches its peak, the elves' shared experiences merge into a harmonious symphony of thoughts, desires, and wisdom. This unity of consciousness allows for a profound connection that transcends individuality while still respecting each elf's unique perspective. When the trance subsides, the elves awaken with a shared understanding of the matter, ready to make decisions founded in consensus and forged through a connection deeper than words alone.

**Trial by Unity:** The Trial by Unity is an ancient and revered ritual held within the heart of the Orenlas forest. It is reserved for the most critical of decisions that require the collective wisdom and unity of the elven community. The location is marked by a sacred clearing adorned with the interwoven branches of ancient trees. As twilight embraces the land, a luminescent mist arises from the forest floor, carrying whispers of Elmerca's guidance.

Elves from all generations converge upon the clearing, their presence acknowledged by the rustling leaves and the gentle caress of the forest's embrace. The ritual begins with a rhythmic chant, invoking the spirits of Aldanor and Elmerca, followed by the slow weaving of magical energies that form a silvery web overhead.

Participants enter a profound trance, their minds entwining like the roots of trees seeking water deep below. This communion draws upon the collective dream-like state that the elves enter during their trances, allowing their thoughts to merge and intermingle. Memories and experiences flow from one elf to another, creating an intricate lattice of shared understanding.

Through this unity, each elf gains insights from others' lives, emotions, and perspectives. The cacophony of overlapping thoughts gradually harmonizes into a unified melody of consensus. When the ritual reaches its zenith, a burst of radiant light envelops the clearing, symbolizing the culmination of their unity.

Emerging from the trance, the elves find themselves bound by a newfound understanding, their decisions shaped not just by dialogue, but by a shared journey through each other's experiences. This unity-driven decision-making process reflects the elves' respect for individuality and their ability to forge consensus while embracing the diversity of their lived lives.

## Erelion

Certainly, let's explore the city of Erelion in more detail and flesh out its unique features and elements. Based on the characteristics of the elven society you've described, here are some ideas for what Erelion might look like:

1. **Living Architecture:** Erelion's buildings are seamlessly intertwined with the natural world. Elaborate towers and palaces appear to grow from the surrounding trees and landscapes, their walls adorned with vines, leaves, and flowers. Bridges woven from living vines connect various parts of the city, allowing elves to traverse the canopy with grace.
    
2. **Bioluminescent Pathways:** At night, the city transforms into a breathtaking spectacle as bioluminescent plants and creatures illuminate the pathways and buildings. Soft, soothing glows light the way, casting a dreamlike aura over the city. It's as if the forest itself comes alive with gentle, shimmering lights.
    
3. **Eldertree Nexus:** At the heart of Erelion stands the majestic Eldertree Nexus, a massive tree that serves as a communal gathering place and a repository of knowledge. The trunk is hollowed out and filled with delicate, luminescent orbs that flicker like stars, casting a calming radiance within the Nexus. Elves gather here for ceremonies, discussions, and celebrations.
    
4. **Fey Garden Districts:** Erelion features different districts, each designed around a specific theme of nature's wonders. Fey Garden Districts are pockets of enchantment where trees take on fantastical shapes, and each building appears to be an organic extension of the landscape. Ponds, waterfalls, and blooming gardens create an atmosphere of perpetual spring.
    
5. **Starlit Observatories:** Elven astronomers revere Elmerca, the wild star, and have established observatories in strategic locations across the city. These observatories feature intricately designed telescopes that allow elves to peer into the mysteries of the cosmos. The observatories are open to all, and many elves find solace in gazing upon distant stars and seeking Elmerca's guidance.
    
6. **Harmony with Wildlife:** Erelion's inhabitants coexist harmoniously with the creatures of the forest. Colorful birds flutter through open windows, and deer roam freely along the city's pathways. Elves communicate with animals through a mix of magical and empathetic connections, creating an atmosphere of mutual respect.
    
7. **Luminous Pools:** Hidden within the heart of Erelion, you'll find serene pools where water reflects the stars and moon above. These pools are said to hold a connection to Elmerca's realm, and elves often visit to seek inspiration or contemplate the mysteries of the wild star. The edges of the pools are lined with luminescent plants, casting a soft glow upon the water's surface.
    
8. **Dream Sanctuaries:** Throughout the city, you'll discover dream sanctuaries, ethereal spaces where elves can enter trance-like states to share dreams and experiences. Elven artists and scholars often visit these sanctuaries to seek inspiration from the collective unconscious of their people.
    
9. **Elven Markets:** Erelion's markets are bustling with activity, offering unique and exotic goods from across the elven lands. Vibrant fabrics, crafted jewelry, and rare herbs and potions are displayed beneath leafy canopies. The markets are not just a place for trade but also a hub for cultural exchange and storytelling.
    
10. **Guiding Crystals:** Scattered throughout the city, you'll find intricate crystals infused with magic that emit soft, soothing glows. These crystals are used as guiding markers, leading travelers through the city's winding pathways and ensuring that no one loses their way, even during the darkest nights.
    

Erelion's beauty and harmony with nature, combined with its unique architectural elements and magical atmosphere, make it a place that feels both tranquil and otherworldly. The city's features reflect the elven reverence for the natural world and their deep connection to Aldanor and Elmerca.
