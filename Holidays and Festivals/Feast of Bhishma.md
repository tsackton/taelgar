### The Feast of Bhishma

Bhishma's Feast day, celebrated as a two day festival starting the day before the night of the first new moon in June, marking the end of summer and the start of the monsoon season. This is usually around the summer solstice.

A celebration of Bhishmaâ€™s ascension to godhood, as well as [[The Founding of Dunmar]]. The first day is a day of remembrance, the second is a pure celebration, a feast and party holiday, usually celebrated with family and kin, not necessarily involving travel back to villages or temples. 

However, it was a time when the Mystai of Bhishma gathered for their annual council and gathering.
