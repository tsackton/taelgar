### Aagirvala

[[Aagir]]'s Feast Day, celebrated on the first full moon after the autumnal equinox. 

Aday to mark victory in battle, but also remember and acknowledge the viciousness of the war of conquest of the Dunmari, and remember those killed in anger. Can be a tense holiday, as it also has strongly nationalistic vibes. Celebrated with feats of strength and endurance, and tournaments, and skill at weaponsmithing.
