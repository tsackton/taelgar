# Festival of the Miracle of the Mist

A [[Mos Numena]] feast day, celebrated on April 18th each spring in [[Abenfyrd]] and several other communites in the headwaters of the [[Aben River]]. It commemorates of a time when [[The Wanderer]] (it is said) used dense mists to lead a pack of trolls from the [[Plaguelands]] into the river, to drown.
