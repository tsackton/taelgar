### A Drankorian Background
DR 300 - 1000

Much of Sembaran history arises from the fractured duchies that arose from the fall of the [[Drankorian Empire]], and the boundaries of the ancient Drankorian provinces still impact the political geography of the land today. 

A thousand years ago, the [[Drankorian Empire]] expanded beyond the [[Mostreve Hills]], and the scattered people of the [[River Semb|Semb]], [[River Enst|Enst]] and [[River Wistel|Wistel]] river valleys were rapidly assimilated. The Drankorians brought modern roads, improved agricultural techniques, and a new religion to the land. Farming and pastoralism was a way of life here, with little technology and little trade. No great wars were fought, the scholars say, and over the generations the old ways were forgotten. Within two lifetimes, a border had been established along the [[River Volta]], and few between the [[River Teft|Teft]] and the [[Mostreve Hills]] remembered the days before the coming of the Drankorians.

In the northern highlands however, and especially amongst the many lakes at the headwaters of the [[River Volta|Volta]], the Drankorian armies bogged down in the cold, snowy winters, and it is said the very skies and earth rose up to defend the Highlanders. Conquest was slow and often abandoned, and in the mountain valleys the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] were not widely acknowledged, and the old gods -- the *[[Kestavo]]* -- were still worshipped.

In the south, [[Tyrwingha]], nestled on the southern shores of the [[The Green Sea]], was also never conquered by [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]. This land had been protected by the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], the Queen of the Evening Mist, for many generations, and the conquerors had not her blessing. It is said that the greatest wizards of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] refused to aid the conquest, recognizing Ethlenn’s great power, and the legions of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], feared throughout the world, threw down their arms. Whether this tales are true or not, it is known that the Empire did not conqueror [[Tyrwingha]]. Yet the Archfey greatly desired to learn the secrets of [[Hkar]] from Drankorian mages, and so a compromise was made. The Archfey would acknowledge the Drankorians as rulers of the land, and welcome their gods, the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] to the land, in exchange for tribute in the form of secret knowledge. Any Tyrwinghans who did not want to live under Drankorian rule would be allowed to depart for the [[Feywild]], to live in the court of the Archfey. Even now, tradition holds that all subjects of the Tyrwinghan crown may choose to invoke their right to leave, trading their oaths of loyalty for a life in the court of the Archfey. Although Ethlenn herself has not been seen or heard for generations, a few desparate or fey-touched choose this gamble even now. 

### The Six Duchies
DR 1000 - DR 1400

Then came the Great Plague, and the collapse of the Drankorian Empire that followed. Little is known of the history of these times, but genealogists claim the line of the Dukes of Sembara began in DR 1142, By the 1250s DR, the six duchies ([[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], [[Duchy of Wisford|Wisford]], [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]], [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], and [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]]) were firmly established, and the Duke of [[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]] was acknowledged as the chief amongst them. The other dukes, save [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], acknowledged the feudal overlordship of the Duke of Sembara.

Over the next generation, a series of small summer conquests slowly added territory to the growing Realm of [[Sembara]], as minor lords pledge fealty to the monarch. Some did so because an army of 1000 Sembaran knights showed up at their castle, and they felt they had no choice; others did so to gain protection from their rivals and ensure stability for their people. The dukes of the five duchies and their knights and vassals become rich from these summer conquests as well as the fertile lands and the slow revival of trade in the [[The Green Sea]]. 

By the 1300s DR, the Sembaran monarchy commanded fealty, either directly, from newly minted barons, or indirectly, from lords sworn to the barons and dukes sworn to the crown, from most of the lowlands between the [[River Teft|Teft]] and the [[River Enst|Enst]]. For the next hundred years or so, the [[The Green Sea]] is peaceful and prosperous. [[Sembara]] grows rich on the strength of its agricultural wealth, and its borders solidify: the [[River Teft]] to the north, the [[River Enst]] to the south, with the western border stretching roughly in a line from the source of the [[River Enst|Enst]] through the [[Aine Hills]] to [[Braebein]], the highlands north of [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]].

### The Unification of [[Sembara]] Under the [[House of Sewick]]
DR 1400 - DR 1462, 1 Derik I - 34 Derik I

By the 1400s, a number of regional powers had started to emerge on the borders of [[Sembara]]. In the northwest, from the highland provinces of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], two realms had emerged: [[Lavnoch]] and [[Ardlas]]. Perched on either side of [[Lake Derwent]], they grew rich with the profit of trade over the mountains, but were often in conflict over control of the lake and access to the Dwarven trade.

North of [[Lavnoch]], the brief [[Zovcka|Unified Crown of Zovcka]] had collapsed, and two northern kingdoms emerged: [[Zovcka]], in the north, and [[Breva]], squeezed between [[Braebein]] and the growing power of the Duke of [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]], the [[Sentinel Range]], and [[Zovcka]]. 

To the northeast, the [[Duchy of Telham]], between the [[River Teft|Teft]] and the [[River Volta|Volta]], commanded the loyalty of many of the small lords along the coast and the rivers, and was closely tied by culture and intermarriage to [[Sembara]].

South of [[Sembara]] were two major powers: the Kingdom of [[Tyrwingha]], which emerged from the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] largely intact and still under the guardianship of the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], and the [[Dominion of Avatus]], a rising military autocracy exerting overlordship of a number of small kingdoms in the [[Mostreve Hills]], growing in power by taxing trade and recruiting mercenaries, largely [[Hobgoblins]].
#### Emergence of the [[House of Sewick]]

While [[Sembara]] thrived during the long peace, underneath, the seeds of conflict grew. A series of weak rulers had ceded many of the royal prerogatives to the dukes and a feeling of security encouraged the dukes to pour resources into fine trade goods and luxuries, rather than castles and armies. Crushing tariffs on Dwarven goods enriched the border lords, but alienated many others, including [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]], who had traditionally enjoyed strong trade relations with [[Sembara]]. And prophets throughout [[Tyrwingha]] were preaching of the End Times, and whole villages were found to have disappeared. Whether fled to the safety of the [[Feywild]] or consumed by darkness, few could answer.

In DR 1425, [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] saw an opportunity. With a mercenary army consisting largely of [[Hobgoblins]] and vicious werewolves, he launched an invasion across the [[River Enst|Enst]]. A series of disasters befell the Sembarans -- the Duke of [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimin]] refused to march his troops south of the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], three hundred knights from [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]] were lost in a summer storm at sea, and the muster of [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]] sent only half the men due to crown, claiming insufficient horses. And the expected help from [[Tyrwingha]] fails to materialize -- the Queen herself commanded her knights to stay within the Tyrwinghan borders. And so the Sembaran army, defeated on the field, retreated with half its force to winter north of the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], and [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] paused to consolidate his gains, and prepared to strike north and east.

Into this moment rode [[Derik I]], a distant relative of the current king, but far from the kingship himself. He had married the second daughter of the Duchess of [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], on [[the Northlands]] coast, and had made a name for himself as a military commander in a series of skirmishes against pirates, in alliance with [[Gazetteer/The Green Sea Region/Western Green Sea/Tollen/Tollen|Tollen]] mercenaries and halflings.

In the months following the advance of [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] to the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], a lizardfolk elder had approached Derik, and told him of an omen: he was prophesied to raise a mighty [[Sembara]] to form a pillar of strength in the dark times to come, and if he did not overthrow [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]], the smallest cloud in the coming storm, the darkest shadows of today would seem like the brightest diamonds of tomorrow. But it was also foretold, this elder said, that only the Queen of the Evening Mist could herald his coming.  

With the blessing of his mother-in-law, Derik sent a small tithe of the knights of the [[Duchy of Telham]] south to aid their ally, the King, and then he sailed with the bulk of the duchy’s forces to [[Tyrwingha]]. There, the old queen had been wracked by dreams of the horrible fate that would befall [[Tyrwingha]] if she entered the war, and so had kept her forces away, despite her misgivings for not aiding an ally.

When Derik arrived in [[Tyrwingha]], he immediately disembarked and spoke with the queen. It is said that as he set foot on Tyrwinghan shores, the morning fog parted, and turned golden where he stepped, leaving a trail of sparklingly mist behind him. Crowds began to follow, and when he reached the castle, the people of [[Tyrwingha]] were watching as he bowed his head humbly to ask to speak with the queen, and [[Archfey Ethlenn]] herself appeared before him, and proclaimed that he would be the savior of [[Tyrwingha]], and kissed him on the forehead, passing him her blessing.   

As news spread like wildfire of a knight from the north who had been blessed by Ethlenn herself, Derik was quickly proclaimed [[Derik I]], King of [[Tyrwingha]] by the [[Oracle of the Riven]]. Derik gathered an army of lizardfolk, the knights of Telham and [[Tyrwingha]], the fey-touched warlocks of the Ethlenn, and [[Gazetteer/The Green Sea Region/Western Green Sea/Tollen/Tollen|Tollen]] and [[Vostok]] mercenaries, which he marched west in the early spring of 1426. Derik drove the forces of [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] before him, and his army is flanked on the banks of the [[River Wistel|Wistel]] and decisively defeated by Derik at the Battle of Wisford. 

By the end of the summer of 1428, the war was over. Derik’s alliance, following the initial success of the Battle of Wisford in 1426, which broke [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]]' lines on the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], and the Battle of Fellburn in 1427, which forced [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] across the [[River Enst|Enst]], won a decisive and complete victory at the Battle of Dalfield, in the northern Mosteve Hills, in the spring of 1428.   

Cloaked in glory and honor from his decisive military leadership and fey-enhanced charisma, Derik forged modern [[Sembara]] at the Treaty of Wisford, signed in the late fall of 1428 DR, which established the Royal Council, codified the independence of lizardfolk in the realm forevermore, and cemented the [[House of Sewick]] as the rulers of the Joined Crowns of [[Sembara]], [[Tyrwingha]], and [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]].  

In the spring and summer of 1429, Derik, now styling himself [[Derik I]] of [[House of Sewick|Sewick]], King of [[Sembara]], Duke of Telham, High Prince of [[Tyrwingha]], Honored Consort of the Queen of the Evening Mist, and Defender of the Four Rivers, marches his army throughout the [[Mostreve Hills]], driving out the last of the [[Hobgoblins]] and accepting the fealty of the local lords. 

In the fall of 1429, the Treaty of [[Valarin]] (a small town in the “gap” in the southern highlands) establishes relations between [[Sembara]] and the [[Istabor Alliance]], a loose confederation of city states and freeholds to the south that is emerging out of the fall of the [[Dominion of Avatus]], setting the extent of [[Sembara]]’s control at the southern edge of the [[Mostreve Hills]]. 

The rest of [[Derik I]]’s long reign is a time of renewed prosperity in [[Sembara]], as trade to the south flourishes, the war-torn Borderlands and Southern Marches revive considerably on the strength of goods flowing across their lands, and occasional raiders from the mountains are met with the full might of [[Sembara]]’s army with [[Derik I]] at the head.
### The Great War
DR 1462 - DR 1545; 1 Derik II - 26 Derik III

The reign of [[Derik II]] is relatively uneventful, and the traditions and formalities of the kingdom are established and propagated in this time. The borders to the south, with the [[Istabor Alliance]], and the north, with the fractured fiefdoms of [[Vostok]], are uneventful, and trading relationships with [[Cymea]], [[Tollen]], and the rest of the eastern Green Sea grow during this time. 
#### Tensions in the North

The only thing that mars the peace of this era is increasing tensions among the highland kingdoms. Several small wars break out between [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]], fighting over control of the headwaters of the Semb and [[Lake Derwent]], and with it access to the lucrative Dwarven trade, while tensions increase between [[Breva]] and the Dwarves over the resources of the upper Teft. Although the violence never spills over into Sembara, trade is disrupted and what to do about the highlands is a constant question during the reign of [[Derik II]]. [[Derik II]], although a strong king and diplomat, is not the military leader his father was, and was reluctant to raise taxes for an invasion.   

Several times the dwarves send diplomatic missions to Sembara, asking the king to deal with his people making trouble, and several times Derik II says there is nothing he can do. By the 1490s, it is clear the situation is untenable, as at this point both the halflings and dwarves are complaining to the king and telling him to get these unruly humans under control before they take it into their own hands, to ensure stability, but at this point Derik II is old, and uncertain, and so nothing is done.

[[Charlotte I]], Derik II’s daughter, inherits the crisis. Unwilling to let relations with the dwarves deteriorate further, Charlotte rides with a large army up the River Semb, and in a relatively bloodless series of campaigns forces [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]] to the negotiating table, asserting suzerainty over the territory of these kingdoms. [[Breva]], fearing conquest, ceases hostilities with the dwarves, and [[Charlotte I]] pushes no further, for by 1508 DR, rumors of something terrible in the north are growing. 
#### The Preamble to the Great War

After his defeat as the hidden puppet master of [[Dominion of Avatus]], [[Cha'mutte]] has turned his attention north, where far across the [[Sentinel Range]] he is growing an empire. Still maintaining footholds in the southern [[Sentinel Range]] where several loyal hobgoblin tribes attempt to prevent the consolidation of the [[Istabor Alliance]] into a united front, he has turned his attention to a move from the north, through the empty northern steppes. Still working through proxies, and not ready to show himself yet, he summoned one of his dragonspawn, the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and set him to gather allies across the northern plains -- orcs, monstrosities, ogres, and trolls -- and set upon Vostok from the north. 

%%% Needs thought 
At the same time, a group of religious fanatics worshipping the children of [[Vacla]]  began to establish themselves in [[Zovcka]] and the Volta borderlands in Vostok, taking control of [[Zovcka]] and persecuting followers of the Eightfold Way.  
%%

Derik III, 19 years old in 1508 DR, is sent to the north. Vostok at this point is ruled in the east by descendants of Skaer raiders, in the lakes region along the Volta increasingly by [[Zovcka]], around Tollen largely as an oligarchy of rich merchants, and to the north as a loose confederation of semi-nomadic tribes. Derik III, channeling the charisma of his great-grandfather, cloaked in the blessing of the Gods, leads a grand alliance north to repair the ancient wall and defeat the dragon. In response, he is acknowledged as Prince of the North, and when he comes to the throne he is acknowledged as high king by the people of Vostok. Tollen retains its charter as a free city, but acknowledges the suzerainty of Derik III. 

%%  Needs thought 
While this is a great victory, in the meantime the situation has deteriorated in Zovcka and Breva. The religious cult has come to fully control Zovcka, and citizens of Breva are pissed that Sembara ignored their plight and suffering to fight battles in foreign lands. 

In DR 1511, Derik III, still Prince and Heir, leads a campaign to the highlands. The conquest is bitter, as Breva descends into civil war with some of the people on the side of Sembara and others on the side of OldGod. Sembara prevails, and forces of OldGod flee to Zovcka, but the price is high, and Derik III does not pursue military conquest of Zovcka.   

In DR 1523, shortly after Derik III comes to the throne, he finally launches a campaign against OldGod (perhaps now revealed to be stoked/encouraged by Cha’mutte), with the aid and support of the local lords on the Vostok side of the Volta. Zovcka is defeated, but worshippers of OldGod slip into hiding. Zovcka nominally acknowledges the overlordship of Sembara, but the local lords are not replaced, only forced to renounce OldGod. 

%%

By DR 1525, Derik III is at least nominally acknowledged as the overlord and high king of all the land from the southern highlands to the northern wall, from [[Sentinel Range]] to the[[Western Gulf]].  In DR 1533, now several years a widower, Derik III marries Jane, the young daughter of an important merchant family in Tollen. 

Over the next 20 years, Sembara remains a strong and united kingdom as various conflicts spread along its borders, culminating in the [[Great War]].

### The Blood Years

DR 1545 - DR 1600; 26 Derik III - 7 Blanche I

After the destruction of the Great War, Sembara experienced just over a year of much needed peace, marked largely by a huge influx of refugees from the south who settled in the [[Duchy of Maseau]] and [[Addermarch]]. In DR 1547. the peace is shattered by a large, grim army following from the south on the heels of the refugees -- first a grim hobgoblin army, then a disorganized mass of monstrosities, great beasts, and other fell terrors fleeing something even worse from the south. Sembara fights to a desperate standstill, holding ground in the Mosteve Hills for several years of death and famine. In the fall of 1549, Derik III dies on the battlefield near Valarin -- but in death, he wins a great victory, and a measure of peace for Sembara, as the last great host of hobgoblins is ridden down and killed.   

Bertam I, Derik’s youngest son, takes the throne in December of 1549, a boy of 11. His mother, Jane, is appointed regent, and Bertram’s entire kingship is dominated by her, a shrewd woman who disliked waste. Bertram is not put forward as an heir by the Tyrwinghan [[Oracle of the Riven]], and instead a local duke ascended to the throne. War-weary, and pragmatic by nature, Jane councils forcefully against any attempt to retake Tyrwingha by might of arms, and focused the kingdom on rebuilding the six duchies. In 1550, Rumors of an endless horde of orcs, and worse, reach Embry from Vostok in this time, and an embassy from several of the Vostok chieftains arrives, but is turned back with only a company of knights to support it, none of whom ever return to Sembara. But whatever chaos consumes the north, little of it reaches the Volta, save for rumors. But Jane and Bertram drop the title “High King of Vostok” from the royal titles and Vostok turns inward for its defenses.  

The year 1551 starts poorly, as winter lingers and it seems like spring will never come. And then, when spring does come, it comes in a season of unseasonably endless rain. Planting is delayed, and worries of famine, and worse spread. That summer, even worse news comes -- a deadly cloud of mists and fog moves north from the old territory of the [[Istabor Alliance]]. Everything -- plants, animals, humans, everything -- dies. Betram is ill-prepared for this threat and Jane pulls the borders close, abandoning the [[Duchy of Maseau]] and [[Addermarch]]. The advance of this curse terrifies the population, and this is, in part, what gives these years the name “the Blood Years” as many die. The deadly advance is stopped by mysterious forces. The area south of the Mostove Hills is left uninhabitable, a barren wasteland of ash and dust, and starts being referred to as the Plaguelands. Famine, on top of plague, makes the winter of 1551-1552 one of the worst in memory, and many villages in the west are abandoned. 

Jane does what she can, but many in the kingdom believe that her true loyalties are more closely aligned with Tollen than her own kingdom -- what food there is to spare from the lowlands is often sold to Tollen instead of the highlands, and muttering can be heard in the Aine Hills and further north, of how Jane is not a true Sembaran.

Bertram I dies this winter, and his nephew, Bertram II (Derik III’s eldest grandson) takes the throne, a young man of 19. Born only three years before his uncle they were raised together as brothers, and Jane was like a surrogate mother to Bertram II. Reginald (Bertram II’s father) was a dashing lord and chief military advisor to his father. He spent much of his life on military campaigns and had little patience for court. His wife was a skilled knight as well, and spent much of her time on campaigns with Reginald. This left Jane to largely raise their children, and Bertam II grew up alongside Bertram I.

Bertram II began his reign in sorrow for his uncle, and never really found his footing. A handsome teenager, convinced of his own immortality and believing himself the equal of his grandfather, he believed he could right the wrongs of the kingdom himself. Jane, still powerful, was his regent for a year, and maintained the loyalty of the five major dukes until her death.

In 1558,  evil creatures attempt a crossing of the [[Sentinel Range]] north of the devastation of Ulrich Monastery, as the Chardonian offensive in the west begins to put pressure on hobgoblin encampments. Still recovering from famine and plague, and still maintaining strong garrisons along the Enst, Jane councils strongly against Sembara joining this war. The highland kingdoms raise their banners anyway, and join together with the dwarves in a great alliance, which, after a series of early setbacks, decisively defeats the threat in 1561.  

[[Bertram II]], after his step-grandmother’s death in 1559, gathers a small force of knights, and without the backing of the Royal Council or any great thought to supply chains, logistics, or military strategy, rides north to aid the barons of Lavnoch and Ardlas against the evil threat. He dies in battle in the deadly winter of 1560, when the tide of battle is turned but great losses were suffered. In early March, 1561, word of Bertram’s death reaches Embry, and [[Blanche I]] is proclaimed queen.  

Blanche was the second daughter, and a quiet, scholarly woman, overshadowed by her strong willed sisters, Elaine and Anne. She spent much of her reign fascinated by the stars, and soon after rising to the queenship, proclaimed the heavens did not wish her to bear an heir. This announcement shook the royal court. The tension between Anne and Elaine was always strong. From birth, they were extremely close but also extremely competitive, extremely smart, and unable to see a way to share power or the throne. Anne and Elaine, however, as the third and fourth daughters of Reginald, had always been expected to be important duchesses, members of the Royal Council, but never in direct competition for the control of the throne.

The next few years were a time of factionalism. [[Blanche I]] retreated to her study of the heavens, largely ignoring the affairs of state. The barons of the highlands came to council less and less, and in the third year of her reign (DR 1563) the barons of Zovcka refuse her summons, and meet instead at the small trade town of Doka, and proclaim Mila, Baroness of the Upper Volta as Queen of Zovcka. Little is done in Embry, as Blanche proclaims the stars had foretold this. Anne, by now the young wife of the heir to the Duchy of Telham, argues for war, but [[Blanche I]] refuses to call her knights, and little comes of it.

1564 is a golden year of fine harvests, and peace throughout the kingdom. For the first time in living memory, no hobgoblins came over the mountains, no beasts rode north from the Plaguelands. [[Blanche I]], however, is increasingly distracted and sickly, spending much of her time searching the stars. She leaves the management of his kingdom to her Royal Council, which is increasingly divided into two hardening factions: Anne, backed by the Duchy of Telham and many of the small baronies in the highlands (at least those that were not turning their backs on Sembara), and Elaine, backed by the major dukes of the heartland, as well as the western and southern marches. 

In 1565, Blanche announces she will depart on a Grand Ambassadorship to the Green Sea, planning to travel to [[Tollen]], [[Skaerhem]], [[Cymea]], [[Tyrwingha]] and [[Irrla]]. Few believe it is wise for her to leave the kingdom for many months, but she  will not be dissuaded. In her absence, she appoints her father’s cousin, [[Wisym I]] as regent. Wisym is a diplomat and peace-maker, and spends much of his brief regency treating with the barons of Ardlas, Breva, and Lavnoch, as well as their dwarven neighbors.

Blanche returns to the capital in 1566, a changed woman - whereas before she was evenhanded in dealing with her sisters, on her return she clearly favors Elaine, and rumors spread that she has plans to name her her sole heir. She also returns with an offer of marriage to Elaine from the King of Tyrwingha. She accepts, and without forsaking her rights to the Sembara throne, retreats to live in Tyrwingha.

In DR 1567, Blanche dies, unexpectedly, in an accidental fall from a tower. Elaine immediately marches north, stopping at every castle and barony in the borderlands and the west, and the Duchies of Wisford, Chemin, and Sembara. She marches down the Semb and encamps five hundred knights outside the walls of Embry as winter falls. Anne does not retreat from this show of force. With the support of the Duchies of Arnsbury, Telham and Seham, and many of the highland barons, she marches her own army to the gates of Embry.

The winter passes slowly. Food is scare, and although no battles are fought, several skirmishes almost break out into a full blown battle. As 1568 dawns, it seemed to all that a battle would break out. Elaine and Anne were no longer speaking to each other. The first to leave were the barons of the highlands. As the capital emptied over fears of errupting violence, a compromise was reached. The halflings (or maybe lizardfolk?) negotiated an agreement: Anne would withdraw to Telham, Elaine to Tyrwingha, and Wisym would take the throne. 

Wisym was crowned king Wisym I in the summer of 1568. However, following the lead of Zovcka, Ardlas, Breva, and Lavnoch refused to acknowledge this compromise. Anne, with stronger ties to the Volta river valley, was proclaimed Queen of Breva, and Ardlas and Lavnoch proclaimed their own rulers.   

Elaine never lost her allies in Sembara, and often visited her younger brother Gyles, installed as the Duke of Sembara, and his household. Anne, more bitter at having had to agree to a compromise, spent fewer and fewer summers at the royal court, and increasingly withdrew into herself. She came to believe that she was cheated of the throne and spent more and more time researching amongst the libraries in Tollen for a simple solution (say, a charm to force her sister to acknowledge her as the rightful queen). Anne even travelled to Chardon, and gathered a small group of wizards around her.

Wisym spent two summers (in 1571 and 1572) campaigning in the highlands, but with little success. The highland kingdoms refused to be drawn back into the Sembara orbit. In 1573, a major force of hobgoblins probed the northern defenses, and were pushed back by the same  dwarven/highland alliance in 1561 that decisively defeated the hobgoblins, and that had now fortified the northern passes against further incursions through an alliance with the stoneborn and dwarves.

The next year, in DR 1574, a Sembara unprepared for a major attack was assaulted on the western front by a mass organized army of hobgoblins, seemingly allied with a darker horror. Rumors sped west from the battlefields of (something about mind flayers). The hobgoblins overran much of the west and south, and were stopped from overrunning all of Sembara only by great sacrifice. The next 4 years of the Hobgoblin Wars were the bloodiest in Sembara history since the Great War. Although the conflict ebbed and flowed, peace never lasted long, until, after 1578, it seemed that the ferocious (mind flayer allies) were defeated. 

This, the First Hobgoblin War, ends in 1578, with the defeat of the mind flayers. But Sembara is not unified or strong enough to push the advantage and a substantial remanent of the Shattered Ice clan establishes a homeland just south of Urlich and in the upper headwaters of the Enst

In 1582, with the Marches of Enford and much of the land south of the Enst still under hobgoblin control, Wisym I dies. 

Ultimately, on Wisym’s death, Anne attempted to control Elaine’s mind with a powerful spell, and force her to give up any claim to the throne. When this failed, and the attempt came out, the populace and nobility turned on Anne, and Elaine was the undisputed queen.  

Anne was executed for treason, although her children were allowed to live in exile and settled in Tollen for the most part, although her youngest son is said to have journeyed the long distance to Chardon.

In the first summer of her reign, in 1582, Elaine plans to launch a major offensive against the hobgoblins in the west, but before her army can come together, in   magic goes wrong. Starting in the Tyrwinghan marches, rangers and others exploring in the Plaguelands notice that fires radiate cold, not heat, and the days get progressively colder as the sun rises, warming again at night. Cooking is impossible, and plants begin to freeze and die. The effect seems to spread along ley lines, out of the Plaguelands, and eventually begins to move into settled areas of Tyrwingha, reaching as far as the River Ernst and the eastern parts of Addermarch (but sparing the Tyrwinghan capitol, thankfully). People panic and flee, but many die in the great famines this causes before an expedition into the Plaguelands heals the land. Many believe this is divine retribution for Anne’s magic, and this strengthens a general distrust of arcane magic in Sembara.   

For the next decade, the Shattered Ice clan skirmishes with Sembaran knights on the borders, and slowly expands their territory, pushing especially a wedge south of the Enst between Maseau and Sembara.

In 1590, in alliance with some of the scattered clans of hobgoblins south of the Andonne, the Shattered Ice clan launches an attack on Maseau. Elaine I, the queen of Sembara at the time, refuses to abandon Maseau and embroils Sembara in the war

The Second Hobgoblin War lasts from 1590 until 1602. At the end of it, the hobgoblins control a swath of territory fairly far East from the mountains. But the war faction of the hobgoblins have been defeated and exhaustion sets in.

An uneasy peace is established and the border starts to be fortified (need to look at the map to see where the border would be exactly, but Cleenseau is near it)

This uneasy peace lasts for a generation, but it is never truly peaceful. Skirmishes frequently break out.

In 1644, something happens TBD and Sembara starts a new war with the hobgoblins. But it doesn’t go well. By 1647 the hobgoblin army has swept east almost as far as Fellburn. (Cleenseau is conquered by the hobgoblins at this point)
  
Cece raises and army and pushes the hobgoblins out over a series of campaigns and by 1650 the hobgoblins have been pushed into the deep mountains. Cece stops there, fortifies the borders, and turns to internal affairs
