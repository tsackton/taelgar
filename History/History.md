# A Brief History of Taelgar

Long ago, in the ancient days of creation, the gods created sentient beings, first the [[Elder Folk]], and later the [[humans]], who grew and spread from their ancestral home on the now-lost continent of [[Hkar]]. In the aftermath of the cataclysm that destroyed [[Hkar]], [[Humans|human]] refugees established the city of [[Drankor]], south of what is now [[Dunmar]]. From this humble beginning, a great empire grew, based on magic, known as the [[Drankorian Empire]]. As the empire grew, it spread its language, [[Mos Numena|religion]], and culture across large swaths of Taelgar. 

Seven hundred years ago, the [[Drankorian Empire]] fell, brought down by a magical plague that even the great wizards of [[Drankor]] could not stop. From the ashes of empire arose new realms and cities: [[Chardon]], a center of learning and the great city of the west; [[Sembara]], a powerful monarchy in the east; the kingdom of [[Dunmar]], inhabited by a people of the plains, who migrated from the far away into the empty spaces left by the collapse of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]; and many others. But as these realms and others grew, the ancient skeletal dragon-god [[Cha'mutte]] was lurking in the north, biding his time and building his army of [[hobgoblins]] and worse.

Two hundred years ago, [[Cha'mutte]] tried to overthrow the gods. The [[Great War]], although it led to [[Cha'mutte|Cha'mutte's]] defeat, left the world changed. A vast crater now lies where mountain passes once carried trade caravans between [[Sembara]] and [[Chardon]], and the fertile [[Istaros|Istaros]] river valley is now a choking land of dust and ash, called the [[Plaguelands]]. For fifty years or more after the [[Great War]] ended, the remains of [[Cha'mutte|Cha'mutte's]] armies roamed the land. The boundaries of civilization shrank, trade decline, and famine and sorrow spread.

Over the past few generations, though, a new normalcy has come to the land, as the [[Great War]] and its aftermath fades from memory. The [[Chardonian Empire]] now stretches a thousand miles, built on the backs of the magical secrets of the [[Great Library]]. Peace and trade have once again come to [[Sembara]], and the merchants of [[Tollen]] and [[Cymea]] ply [[Green Sea]] once more. The Dunmari thrive behind the divine protections that guard their eastern border from the evils of the [[Plaguelands]]. While the frontiers remain dangerous, the world that has emerged from the darkness is one of hope.
