The [[Great War]] left Dunmar in chaos and the land changed, with much of the once-fertile heartlands of the country turned to arid, barren deserts, the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] rising to the west, and the new lands of the [[Nayan Floodplains]] emerging from the [[Nevos Sea]]. The [[Nayan Dynasty]] was founded in the west, establishing a new administrative center, [[Nayahar]], on the [[Nayan]] River, and slowly reclaims land as far east as the [[~Karawa Desert~]]. 

The first 50 years of the [[Nayan Dynasty]] was marked by a series of wars: 
- The [[Fire War]], against the fire giant [[Mavdyr]] and his allies
- The [[Bitter Knife War]], against the Bitter Knife hobgbolin nation based in the [[Nashtkar]]
- The [[Northern War]], against the [[Blackened Claw]] hobgoblin clan based in the [[Samtal]] and the upper reaches of the [[Hara]]. 

At the end of the Northern War in the 53rd year of the Nayan Dynasty (DR 1610), the hobgoblin threat from the [[Desolation of Cha'mutte]] was decisively defeated. Over the next 100 years, the attention of the Nayan Samraats largely turned to the lands around the [[Shrev]] and beyond, as repeated, unsuccessful attempts were made to clear the various magical dangers of the jungles beyond.

In the 161st year of the Nayan Dynasty (DR 1718), Samraat Nayan Lina came to power young, at a turbulent time, shortly after the [[Summer of Red Storms]] and at a time of increasing dissent among the eastern temples. Her death in 171 Nayan (DR 1728) led to the [[Nayan Succession Crisis]], which was eventually resolved by the ascension of Samraat Nayan Marathu to power the following year. 

Twelve years later, in 183 Nayan (DR 1740), Marathu was killed, along with a young woman named [[Sura]] who was widely seen as blessed by the gods and the obvious choice to succeed Marathu. Karnas, Sura's brother, is proclaimed Samraat [[Nayan Karnas]] by the western temples in 183 Nayan (DR 1740), a move that was seen by many in the east as presumptuous and driven by political, not religious, considerations. 

In the 191st year of the Nayan Dynasty (DR 1748), Sura was freed from captivity by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]]; she had been trapped in an extra-dimensional space in a magic mirror by the hag [[Agata|Agata Dustmother]]. Sura's return triggered the [[Siblings War]].
