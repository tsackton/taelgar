# The Drankorian Empire

The Drankorian Empire was a vast, continent-spanning empire that stretched from the [[Endless Ocean]] to the [[Green Sea]] and ruled over much of humanity during the millenia following [[The Downfall]] of [[Hkar]]. The Drankorian Empire was known for its strength in magic; the battle mages of [[Drankor]] not only protected the Empire from magical and extraplanar threats but also meant that few could stand against the full might of the Empire in battle. A civilization rich in scholarly traditions, [[Drankor]] was filled with learned societies, organizations dedicated to magical lore.
## History

The Drankorian Empire grew out of the city of Drankor, founded near the mouth of the %% name not yet canonical %% Crescara ("Kres-kah-rah") river, largely by refugees fleeing the destruction of Hkar. From this base, the Drankorians quickly came to rule over the fertile plains along the coast, and the Crescara river valley. In Drankorian reckoning, which dates to the founding of Drankor in 4133 by the dwarven count of years, the following major events summarize the history of Drankor (taken from Cavarrio's Chronicles of Drankor.):

- (DR:: 1): The city of [[Drankor]] is founded by refugees from [[Hkar]] fleeing the wars of [[The Downfall]]
- (DR:: 169): Celadir is proclaimed the first Emperor of [[Drankor]], laying claim to the coastal plains and the rich Crescara river valley.
- (DR::402): The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] is signed by Emperor Goristo, and establishes the Volta as the northern border of the Drankorian Empire; the Skaer and other descendants of the ancient mariner cultures living in what is now Sembara and Cymea are imperial subjects.
- (DR:: 525) - (DR_end:: 528): The Demonfire Wars, fought against a severe abyssal incursion. Emperor Ingwelir, a renowned wizard and warrior, died at the gates of Drankor defending the city against a demon lord. 
- (DR:: 528) - (DR_end:: 595): The Peace of Drankor, a time of peace and prosperity in the aftermath of the Demonfire Wars. Ended by the fratricide of Oros the Cruel. Later known as the First Peace or the First Golden Age. 
- (DR:: 597): The Battle of Yaroket ("Yah-roh-keht"), won by Drankor in the Myraeni Gap, begins the Western Wars and the conquest of the western coast by Drankor
- (DR:: 634): The Battle of Tawir Forest ends the Drankorian conquest of the west on the northern shores of Lake Valandros. 
- (DR:: 647): The beginning of the Great Peace, sometimes called the Golden Age of Drankor, a period of 300 years of sustained peace and prosperity across the empire.  
- (DR:: 688): The Sibyline Archives, which will eventually become the Great Library, is founded in the developing city of Chardon
- (DR:: 965): The Drankorian Civil War begins with the assassination of Emperor Helea by allies of the [[Omnis Pura]], and is won by Emperor Vestian, associated with [[Omnis Pura]]
- (DR:: 1001) - (DR_end:: 1013): The Dominion Wars, a series of attempted conquests to the east
- (DR:: 1059): The destruction of [[Drankor]] by the Plague Mist

## Culture

As Drankor grew into a major power, then great empire, a few aspects of its culture stood out, and have remained associated with Drankor even after its fall. 

- Magic was absolutely central to Drankorian culture. The Drankorians didn’t draw strong divisions among types of magic: to them, it is all just the manipulation of extraplanar energy. Whether that is the Void via a Divine intermediary, the Plane of Magic, or the Feywild through a Archfey intermediary is of only secondary importance.

- Drankor, founded in the aftermath of perhaps the greatest supernatural catastrophe humankind had ever experienced, was deeply, deeply concerned with learning as much as possible about the secrets of the multiverse, and protecting its people from supernatural danger. While the strength of Drankorian magic meant that few, if any, extant human cultures could present an existential threat to the empire (they lost wars, but pretty much only when overextended on the frontier), supernatural dangers -- dragons, giants, undead, fiends, and similar creatures -- could still present real danger. 

- Drankor was a culture of communities -- societies, secret and not, orders, guilds, and clubs, all these kinds of factions and affiliations were very common across all of Drankorian society. 

### Drankorian Secret Societies

Little has come to modern times about the exact nature of Drankorian secret societies, but three at least have been noted by students and travelers. 

- [[Omnis Pura]]: The [[Omnis Pura]] were heavily involved in the Drankorian Civil War, seen by later historians as a revolt against the increasing power and influence of diverse human cultures, including those who had left Hkar long before the Downfall, in the empire. The power behind the throne in the last hundred years of the Empire. Apollyon, the last emperor of Drankor, was strongly associated with [[Omnis Pura]]. 
- [[Occulta Ludum]]: The Occulta Ludum were associated with the development of magic and especially with practical inventions of harnessing magical power. While they rejected the extremist claims of the [[Omnis Pura]] in the later years of the Empire, there is little evidence that has come down to current day that they actively opposed [[Omnis Pura]].
- [[Fides Lucaris]]: The Fides Lucaris were associated with the Emperor Helea and the losing side of the Drankorian civil war. Little is known about what they did in the last few hundred years of the Empire; the only records that have readily been accessible to historians are those of executions and exile when members of the Fides Lucaris were caught. They seem to have been a cross-species alliance, involving at least humans and elves.

Notes from: Google Drive
#### Founding

The City of Drankor is founded in the year 4133, only 11 years after the Downfall of Hkar. Although initially a small settlement in a fertile river valley, it quickly attracts refugees who have landed along the coast of the Sea of Storms, and by 4180 Drankor is a city proper, recreating as best possible the grand urban centers of Hkar, and the people of Drankor have begun to spread north, east, and west, settling and farming the fertile grasslands and remnant woodlands of what was, before the Downfall, a great forest and elven kingdom. Fires swept across most of the land, burning the trees, but the rains were plentiful and the soil fertile, so new life sprung back rapidly in this land. 

By 4300 or so, the nascent Drankorian Empire stretches along the coast of the Sea of Storms, as far east as the shores of GreatBay, as far west as the Nevos Sea, and north into the empty expanses of the land that is now Dunmar. Many in Drankor, only a few generations removed from the days of Hkar, turn east and south, trying to reclaim old trading connections. But the Sea of Storms was chaotic to navigate, the mountainous lands to the east the home of hobgoblins and worse, and the lands to the south torn by upheaval and destruction, desertification and flooding. So, the Drankorian Empire turned its sights north.

#### The Culture of Drankor

As Drankor grew into a major power, then great empire, a few aspects of its culture stood out. 

- Magic was absolutely central to Drankorian culture. The Drankorians didn’t draw strong divisions among types of magic: to them, it is all just the manipulation of extraplanar energy. Whether that is the Void via a Divine intermediary, the Plane of Magic, or the Feywild through a Archfey intermediary is of only secondary importance.

While the strength of Drankorian magic meant that few, if any, extant human cultures could present an existential threat to the empire (they lost wars, but pretty much only when overextended on the frontier), supernatural dangers -- dragons, giants, undead, fiends, etc -- could still present real danger.

- Drankor was a culture of communities -- societies, secret and not, orders, guilds, and clubs, all these kinds of factions and affiliations were very common across all of Drankorian society. 

#### Expansion

Over the next 100 years, the Drankorian Empire expanded north and west, to the Myrenai Gap in the west and the southern reaches of the Irebor river valley in the north. Most of this land was empty, fertile territory, left unpopulated after the fall of Alcarinquë. During this time, most of Drankor’s attention was focused on the eastern borders, where a series of defensive fortifications are constructed between the EastBranchMahar and the GreatBay, to provide defense against incursions from the survivors of the Armies of Despair that fought during the Downfall Wars. On the northern frontiers, more than 1000 miles from Drankor and the center of the Empire, contact and trade with the northern peoples, both east and west of the CentralMountains, slowly began to grow.


The first war the Drankorian Empire fought was against the hobgoblins of the EasternMountains, a short decisive victory, and a key moment in the self image of the nascent empire. The decisive turning point in this war was the deployment of mages, both human and Peronar, and from this conflict the use of war magic becomes a major focus of the Drankorians. 


However, despite a clear victory, the Drankorians did not seek to expand east. The land beyond the mountains was barren and empty, rugged unpopulated wastelands unsuitable for farming, and even the shores of the [[Green Sea]] were largely empty. The nomadic Dunmari and other desert people traveled through this land occasionally, but the civilization growing in the coastal lands abandoned by the lizardfolk at the end of the ThirdAge is more than 1000 miles away, and the Drankorians did not push far into the wastes of NAME
#### Assimilation of the Western [[Green Sea]]  

By 4400, the Drankorian Empire is firmly established in the lands that are now Dunmar, with fortified borders to the west, along the Myrenai Gap, and the east, along the NAME Mountains. Over the next 150 years, Drankor fully comes into its own as by far the dominant power on the continent, and expands -- largely by assimilation and relatively non-violent conquest -- north along the Irebor River Valley into the western [[Green Sea]]. By 4550, Drankor has pushed north to the Volta, and east to the coasts of the [[Green Sea]], save for the fey-protected land of Tyrwingha, a few small highland kingdoms in the foothills of the CentralMountains, and the forests and swamps of the Elven and Lizardfolk kingdoms. 

As the Drankorian Empire spread, its institutions spread as well. Most prominent was Mos Numena, the religion of the Eight Divines that was central to Drankorian worship. While in some parts of the [[Green Sea]] the worship practice of the Mos Numena changed to fit local customs, the power of the Eight Divines was undeniable, and many converted, even those not directly under Drankorian rule. The organized practice of magic also spread with Drankorian expansion. Drankorian society was both highly magical and full of membership groups, many devoted to the study of magic, both divine and arcane
  
#### Western War

After several hundred years of peace, a new expansionist regime takes control in Drankor, looking to the west coast. Although the Myraeni Gap, between the Central Mountains and the Coast Mountains was and is rough and hard land, beyond the fertile coastal plains tempt the Drankorian emperors. In 4712, the Drankorian armies march west, and in three short years quickly cross the Yerahd and reach the coast, fortifying the banks of the Nahadi. Over the next decade, a series of bitter campaigns slowly drive the Northerners north, beyond Lake Valandros, and into the depths of the Great Forest, and the Drankorians conqueror the fertile coastal plains north of the Nahadi. 


The Northerners who live south of Lake Valandros  are to a large extent forcibly assimilated; the small gods of the ancient Northlander tradition are hunted down and driven extinct, and the people who won’t convert to Mos Numera, or submit to Drankorian rule, were exiled or slaughtered. 


- The assimilated Northerners, further north in the lands north of the lake but south and inland of the NorthernBay, develop a culture with a mix of Drankorian and Northern elements. In most of this region, the worship of the Eight Divines displaces pre-existing religions. 
    
- The exiled Northerners form two major branches, who retain their ancestral religious traditions.
    

- Many of those that fled Drankorian rule fled west to the islands, which is already one of the more urbanized population centers of the northern culture
    
- Others fled north into the marginal lands along the Northern Bay and further north. 
    

### The Fall of Drankor

  
Then, Drankor falls, and the first plague devastates the central core of the Drankorian Empire, and causes much political turmoil across the empire. While the geographic changes associated with this plague are not nearly as great as those associated with the downfall of Hkar or the death of Cha’mutte, some significant impacts develop. First, the area around the mouth of the DrankorRiver is cursed and haunted, and the Sea of Storms intensifies, making the coastal route south difficult/impossible for regular trade, and isolating the south coastal people. Second, shifts in winds and rain and currents promote desertification on the northern edge of the great desert, driving the Dunmari north and west.
