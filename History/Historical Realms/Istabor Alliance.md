# The Istabor Alliance
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

%% status/incomplete -> There are several long conversations in Discord or email about [[Isingue]] and the Istabor Alliance and its place in the pre-Great War history that should probably be brought in here at least as notes %%

The Istabor Alliance was an alliance of city states and their hinterlands before the Great War. During the war it was destroyed, and much of the rich river valleys and farmland is now accursed and called the Plaguelands.
