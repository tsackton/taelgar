# The Republic of Varjatta
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

A lost realm destroyed in the [[Great War]] and its aftermath. 

%%^Campaign:none%%

This is a name stolen from some early 2000s era text in the post-Campaign-1 world building spree. Reused as a name drop in research from Kassi. 

Basically, this and the [[Ausberg Empire]] are just blank names that I like, but that have no details. The only important information is "north of Lake Valandros"

%%^End%%
