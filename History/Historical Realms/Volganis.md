# Volganis

Volganis, like [[Amani]], is a prominent realm from before the [[Great War]], that did not survive the [[Blood Years]]. 

%%^Campaign:none%%

Even less established about Volganis than about Amani, although the crown jewels of Volgannis later turned up in a dragon hoard, implying it was a monarchy at least. 

This country was lifted from the "Kingdom of Volkrad" campaign setting that was used in a bunch of Dungeon Magazine adventures, e.g. A Hot Day in L'Trel in [Dungeon 44](https://annarchive.com/files/Dungeon%20Magazine%20%23044.pdf). Referenced in old high school material a lot, as a kingdom fighting against Pandar 

Renamed to Volganis

Primary context: 
- [[West Coast History Framework]]
- [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]]
