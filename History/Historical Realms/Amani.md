# Amani

Amani was a prominent realm, occupying much of the land around what is now [[Greater Voltara]], during and immediately after the [[Great War]]. The realm was completely decimated during the [[Blood Years]] and survives only in rumors, legends, and folklore. 

%%^Campaign:none%%

The wizard [[Airion]] was a prominent Amani. 

All that is canonically established about Amani is vibes: it was a place where magic had influence and was respected, but it was outside the political and cultural orbit of Chardon. 

Given its size, it is possible that Amani was some kind of confederation, or a cultural descriptor for a collection of related kingdoms (ala Christian Spain in the late Middle Ages or something).
