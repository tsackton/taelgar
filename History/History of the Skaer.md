# History of the Skaer

%% this note covers the history of the [[Skaer]] people %%

This is a chronicle of the history of the [[Skaer]], from when they first settled on the shores of the [[Green Sea]] to the current day. 

## Origins
_before the Downfall_

The Skaer have a long history on the Green Sea. Their myths and legends speak of coming from the east on great ships; they are descended from the ancient [[~Mariners~|seafaring culture]] that left [[Hkar]] and settled the [[Green Sea]] in the centuries before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. 

%%^Campaign:none%%
### DM Notes

The exact details of the origins of the Skaer are not invented, although they are definitely descended from the mariner culture that left Hkar. One possible option is they were eastern mariners fleeing a religious schism and trying to find a quiet place to live in peace. 

Some invention has suggested that Kaikkea is a survivor of a lost mariner pantheon, but this is not canon. There are undeveloped ideas about a mariner religious schism that could also explain a burst of new gods, potentially. 

It is not clear if the pre-Downfall culture should properly be called "proto-Skaer" or if these are fully "Skaer" already.

## The Skaer Empire
_Downfall to DR 402_

In the aftermath of the end of the [[Downfall Wars]], the [[Western Green Sea]] was left changed: the lizardfolk and elven empires that once dominated were gone, as the great swamps dried out.  During this period, the influence of the Skaer grew, as they established a significant maritime empire in the Western Green Sea. This era ended as the Skaer empire fell away before Drankorian expansion, sealing with the [[Treaty of Marhavn]] in DR 402.

- (DR::402): The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] between the [[Skaer]] and the [[Drankorian Empire]] marks the end of Skaer dominance in the [[Western Green Sea]]. 


%%^Campaign:none%%
### DM Notes

Again, little is developed or invented. The Skaer are significant in Tollen in this period, so must at least control that far west; they presumably also control the [[Straits of Cymea]]. Some development around [[Languages]] and [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]] point to significant Skaer influence across the western Green Sea (cf in particular [[Languages#Eastros Language Family]]). 

Some discussion, but not introduced or canon, suggests that [[Kaikkea]] / the Skaer religion encouraged expansion post Downfall, with an expansionist strand of their religion driving the formation of their empire. This is possibly meant to have some prophetic / "for the good of the world" kind of vibes. 

#### Context at End of Era

Note that the idea that Vostok means "home of the Vos" and the idea of Skaegenland being 'land of the Skaer" (cf: [[Vostok]], [[Skaerhem]]) strongly requires a cultural distinction between "Vos" and "Skaer" when these names are largely established. This presumably must start during the Skaer empire phase, though the exact details of cultural strands in Vostok remain unresolved (cf: [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]] for some discussion). 


%%^End%%

## Retrenchment
_DR 402 - DR 1059_

As the Drankorian Empire establishes dominance over the [[Western Green Sea]], and especially the [[Western Gulf]], the Skaer retreat north, remaining in coastal [[Vostok]] and especially the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]], which are called [[Skaerhem|Skaegenland]] by the Drankorians and later peoples of [[Greater Sembara]]. 

%%^Campaign:none%%
### DM Notes

Nothing is invented about the Skaer during the Drankorian era, except that the Skaer largely do not get incorporated or influenced by Drankor: they retain their worship of the ocean goddess [[Kaikkea]] and their language. This means they must have largely retreated from Drankorian land, though note discussion above about [[Skaerhem|Skaegenland]] vs [[Vostok|Vosland]]. 

%%^End%%

## Competition
_DR 1059 - DR 1700ish

After the [[Fall of Drankor]], the Skaer culture grows in the absence of Drankorian control, does not establish an empire or control significant territory within the Western Gulf, partly due to increased maritime competition from [[Cymea]] in this era. 

%%^Campaign:none%%
### DM Notes

Brainstorming includes these notes:

- After the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], the Skaer expand again, but now [[Cymea]] is a strong competitor, and the Skaer end up raiding in the [[Western Gulf]] instead of fully establishing an empire. This is a foundational period of Sembaran history, and legends of Skaer raiders become embedded in the Sembaran psyche. 
- After the [[Great War]], the Skaer do not turn to expansion again, and it is the Tollender navy that claims the power vacuum as [[Cymea]] declines. 

However, this is not necessarily deeply considered and should be treated as an idea. Part of this idea is establishing two strands of Skaer religion, an expansionist strand and a conservative strand that are variably dominant in Skaer culture. This also should be treated as an idea.
