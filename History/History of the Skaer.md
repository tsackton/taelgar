## History

The Skaer have a long history, tracing their ancestry to the original mariners that left [[Hkar]] before [[The Downfall]] and settled in the [[Green Sea]]. Bullet points:

- Original Skaer were eastern mariners fleeing a religious schism and trying to find a quiet place to live in peace
- After [[The Downfall]], the expansionist strand of their religion became dominant, and the Skaer established a maritime empire stretching from the Skaer islands to the [[Western Gulf]] and much of [[Cymea]]. 
- The empire fell away before the Drankorian expansion, and the Skaer retreated to the islands and the near shores of [[Vostok]] and western [[Ursk]]
- After the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], the Skaer expand again, but now [[Cymea]] is a strong competitor, and the Skaer end up raiding in the [[Western Gulf]] instead of fully establishing an empire. This is a foundational period of Sembaran history, and legends of Skaer raiders become embedded in the Sembaran psyche. 
- After the [[Great War]], the Skaer do not turn to expansion again, and it is the Tollender navy that claims the power vacuum as [[Cymea]] declines.
