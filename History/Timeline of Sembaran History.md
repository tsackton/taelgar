# The Drankorian Conquest
DR 300 - DR 431
### Overview
In the aftermath of [[The Downfall]] the land that will become [[Sembara]] is lightly populated. The [[Kestavo|kestavo-worshipping]] [[Highland Kingdoms|highlanders]] live in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]], and have spread down the valleys of the great rivers: the [[River Semb|Semb]], the [[River Volta|Volta]], the [[River Teft|Teft]], and the [[River Wistel|Wistel]]. Along the coast, [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] mariners raid, intermarry, and settle amongst the highlanders, and a Skaer-dominated mixed culture spreads from [[Tollen]] to the mouth of the [[River Semb|Semb]]. The once mighty [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] swamps have mostly disappeared, save for a remnant, [[Ozabal]], at the mouth of the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], where a thriving lizardfolk community remains. South of the Wistel is the mixed community of humans, clustered along the coast, united by the their shared allegiance to the [[Archfey Ethlenn]].

Over a series of start-and-start campaigns over 60 years, the Drankorian armies conqueor most of the lands between the [[Sentinel Range]] and the [[The Green Sea|Green Sea]], save for some of the highland realms in the northern foothills.

# The Drankorian Age
DR 431 - DR 1059
### Overview
By DR 431, when the Drankorian army retreated from [[Zovcka]], the borders of Drankor in the east were established, and would not change for many generations. Drankor ruled all the lands between the [[Sentinel Range]] and the [[Western Gulf]] south of the [[River Semb|Semb]]. North of the [[River Semb|Semb]], Drankor ruled the the region south and west of the [[Volta]], as far north as the [[Braebine Hills]]. 

The Drankorians brought modern roads, improved agricultural techniques, and a new religion to the land. Farming and pastoralism was a way of life here, with little technology and little trade. No great wars were fought and [[Mos Numena]] spread rapidly, and the old [[Kestavo|Kestavan]] traditions were largely forgotten.

* DR 1142: [[Adrian]] establishes himself in [[Embry]] as the first [[Duchy of Sembara|Duke of Sembara]]

# The Six Duchies
DR 1250 - DR 1400
### Overview
By DR 1250, six great duchies had been established in the lands once ruled by Drankor: [[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], [[Duchy of Wisford|Wisford]], [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]], [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], and [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]]. Each duke was a powerful lord and commanded fealty of barons and lords within their realms. 

%%Then came the Great Plague, and the collapse of the Drankorian Empire that followed. Little is known of the history of these times, but genealogists claim the line of the Dukes of Sembara began in DR 1142, By the 1250s DR, the six duchies ([[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], [[Duchy of Wisford|Wisford]], [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]], [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], and [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]]) were firmly established, and the Duke of [[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]] was acknowledged as the chief amongst them. The other dukes, save [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], acknowledged the feudal overlordship of the Duke of Sembara.

Over the next generation, a series of small summer conquests slowly added territory to the growing Realm of [[Sembara]], as minor lords pledge fealty to the monarch. Some did so because an army of 1000 Sembaran knights showed up at their castle, and they felt they had no choice; others did so to gain protection from their rivals and ensure stability for their people. The dukes of the five duchies and their knights and vassals become rich from these summer conquests as well as the fertile lands and the slow revival of trade in the [[The Green Sea]]. 

By the 1300s DR, the Sembaran monarchy commanded fealty, either directly, from newly minted barons, or indirectly, from lords sworn to the barons and dukes sworn to the crown, from most of the lowlands between the [[River Teft|Teft]] and the [[River Enst|Enst]]. For the next hundred years or so, the [[The Green Sea]] is peaceful and prosperous. [[Sembara]] grows rich on the strength of its agricultural wealth, and its borders solidify: the [[River Teft]] to the north, the [[River Enst]] to the south, with the western border stretching roughly in a line from the source of the [[River Enst|Enst]] through the [[Aine Hills]] to [[Braebein]], the highlands north of [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]].

# The Unification
DR 1400 - DR 1462, 7 Dominick IV - 34 Derik I
### Overview
By the 1400s, a number of regional powers had started to emerge on the borders of [[Sembara]]. In the northwest, from the highland provinces of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], two realms had emerged: [[Lavnoch]] and [[Ardlas]]. Perched on either side of [[Lake Derwent]], they grew rich with the profit of trade over the mountains, but were often in conflict over control of the lake and access to the Dwarven trade.

North of [[Lavnoch]], the brief [[Zovcka|Unified Crown of Zovcka]] had collapsed, and two northern kingdoms emerged: [[Zovcka]], in the north, and [[Breva]], squeezed between [[Braebein]] and the growing power of the Duke of [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]], the [[Sentinel Range]], and [[Zovcka]]. 

To the northeast, the [[Duchy of Telham]], between the [[River Teft|Teft]] and the [[River Volta|Volta]], commanded the loyalty of many of the small lords along the coast and the rivers, and was closely tied by culture and intermarriage to [[Sembara]].

South of [[Sembara]] were two major powers: the Kingdom of [[Tyrwingha]], which emerged from the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] largely intact and still under the guardianship of the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], and the [[Dominion of Avatus]], a rising military autocracy exerting overlordship of a number of small kingdoms in the [[Mostreve Hills]], growing in power by taxing trade and recruiting mercenaries, largely [[Hobgoblins]].

# The Great War
DR 1462 - DR 1545; 1 Derik II - 26 Derik III
### Overview

%%
By the 1400s, a number of regional powers had started to emerge on the borders of [[Sembara]]. In the northwest, from the highland provinces of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], two realms had emerged: [[Lavnoch]] and [[Ardlas]]. Perched on either side of [[Lake Derwent]], they grew rich with the profit of trade over the mountains, but were often in conflict over control of the lake and access to the Dwarven trade.

North of [[Lavnoch]], the brief [[Zovcka|Unified Crown of Zovcka]] had collapsed, and two northern kingdoms emerged: [[Zovcka]], in the north, and [[Breva]], squeezed between [[Braebein]] and the growing power of the Duke of [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]], the [[Sentinel Range]], and [[Zovcka]]. 

To the northeast, the [[Duchy of Telham]], between the [[River Teft|Teft]] and the [[River Volta|Volta]], commanded the loyalty of many of the small lords along the coast and the rivers, and was closely tied by culture and intermarriage to [[Sembara]].

South of [[Sembara]] were two major powers: the Kingdom of [[Tyrwingha]], which emerged from the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] largely intact and still under the guardianship of the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], and the [[Dominion of Avatus]], a rising military autocracy exerting overlordship of a number of small kingdoms in the [[Mostreve Hills]], growing in power by taxing trade and recruiting mercenaries, largely [[Hobgoblins]].
#### Emergence of the [[House of Sewick]]

While [[Sembara]] thrived during the long peace, underneath, the seeds of conflict grew. A series of weak rulers had ceded many of the royal prerogatives to the dukes and a feeling of security encouraged the dukes to pour resources into fine trade goods and luxuries, rather than castles and armies. Crushing tariffs on Dwarven goods enriched the border lords, but alienated many others, including [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]], who had traditionally enjoyed strong trade relations with [[Sembara]]. And prophets throughout [[Tyrwingha]] were preaching of the End Times, and whole villages were found to have disappeared. Whether fled to the safety of the [[Feywild]] or consumed by darkness, few could answer.

In DR 1425, [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] saw an opportunity. With a mercenary army consisting largely of [[Hobgoblins]] and vicious werewolves, he launched an invasion across the [[River Enst|Enst]]. A series of disasters befell the Sembarans -- the Duke of [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimin]] refused to march his troops south of the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], three hundred knights from [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]] were lost in a summer storm at sea, and the muster of [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]] sent only half the men due to crown, claiming insufficient horses. And the expected help from [[Tyrwingha]] fails to materialize -- the Queen herself commanded her knights to stay within the Tyrwinghan borders. And so the Sembaran army, defeated on the field, retreated with half its force to winter north of the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], and [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] paused to consolidate his gains, and prepared to strike north and east.

Into this moment rode [[Derik I]], a distant relative of the current king, but far from the kingship himself. He had married the second daughter of the Duchess of [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], on [[the Northlands]] coast, and had made a name for himself as a military commander in a series of skirmishes against pirates, in alliance with [[Gazetteer/The Green Sea Region/Western Green Sea/Tollen/Tollen|Tollen]] mercenaries and halflings.

In the months following the advance of [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] to the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], a lizardfolk elder had approached Derik, and told him of an omen: he was prophesied to raise a mighty [[Sembara]] to form a pillar of strength in the dark times to come, and if he did not overthrow [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]], the smallest cloud in the coming storm, the darkest shadows of today would seem like the brightest diamonds of tomorrow. But it was also foretold, this elder said, that only the Queen of the Evening Mist could herald his coming.  

With the blessing of his mother-in-law, Derik sent a small tithe of the knights of the [[Duchy of Telham]] south to aid their ally, the King, and then he sailed with the bulk of the duchy’s forces to [[Tyrwingha]]. There, the old queen had been wracked by dreams of the horrible fate that would befall [[Tyrwingha]] if she entered the war, and so had kept her forces away, despite her misgivings for not aiding an ally.

When Derik arrived in [[Tyrwingha]], he immediately disembarked and spoke with the queen. It is said that as he set foot on Tyrwinghan shores, the morning fog parted, and turned golden where he stepped, leaving a trail of sparklingly mist behind him. Crowds began to follow, and when he reached the castle, the people of [[Tyrwingha]] were watching as he bowed his head humbly to ask to speak with the queen, and [[Archfey Ethlenn]] herself appeared before him, and proclaimed that he would be the savior of [[Tyrwingha]], and kissed him on the forehead, passing him her blessing.   

As news spread like wildfire of a knight from the north who had been blessed by Ethlenn herself, Derik was quickly proclaimed [[Derik I]], King of [[Tyrwingha]] by the [[Oracle of the Riven]]. Derik gathered an army of lizardfolk, the knights of Telham and [[Tyrwingha]], the fey-touched warlocks of the Ethlenn, and [[Gazetteer/The Green Sea Region/Western Green Sea/Tollen/Tollen|Tollen]] and [[Vostok]] mercenaries, which he marched west in the early spring of 1426. Derik drove the forces of [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] before him, and his army is flanked on the banks of the [[River Wistel|Wistel]] and decisively defeated by Derik at the Battle of Wisford. 

By the end of the summer of 1428, the war was over. Derik’s alliance, following the initial success of the Battle of Wisford in 1426, which broke [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]]' lines on the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], and the Battle of Fellburn in 1427, which forced [[Emperor Avatus|Avatus]] across the [[River Enst|Enst]], won a decisive and complete victory at the Battle of Dalfield, in the northern Mosteve Hills, in the spring of 1428.   

Cloaked in glory and honor from his decisive military leadership and fey-enhanced charisma, Derik forged modern [[Sembara]] at the Treaty of Wisford, signed in the late fall of 1428 DR, which established the Royal Council, codified the independence of lizardfolk in the realm forevermore, and cemented the [[House of Sewick]] as the rulers of the Joined Crowns of [[Sembara]], [[Tyrwingha]], and [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]].  

In the spring and summer of 1429, Derik, now styling himself [[Derik I]] of [[House of Sewick|Sewick]], King of [[Sembara]], Duke of Telham, High Prince of [[Tyrwingha]], Honored Consort of the Queen of the Evening Mist, and Defender of the Four Rivers, marches his army throughout the [[Mostreve Hills]], driving out the last of the [[Hobgoblins]] and accepting the fealty of the local lords. 

In the fall of 1429, the Treaty of [[Valarin]] (a small town in the “gap” in the southern highlands) establishes relations between [[Sembara]] and the [[Istabor Alliance]], a loose confederation of city states and freeholds to the south that is emerging out of the fall of the [[Dominion of Avatus]], setting the extent of [[Sembara]]’s control at the southern edge of the [[Mostreve Hills]]. 

The rest of [[Derik I]]’s long reign is a time of renewed prosperity in [[Sembara]], as trade to the south flourishes, the war-torn Borderlands and Southern Marches revive considerably on the strength of goods flowing across their lands, and occasional raiders from the mountains are met with the full might of [[Sembara]]’s army with [[Derik I]] at the head.
