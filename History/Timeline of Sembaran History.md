# The Drankorian Conquest
DR 300 - DR 431
### Overview
In the aftermath of [[The Downfall]] the land that will become [[Sembara]] is lightly populated. The [[Kestavo|kestavo-worshipping]] [[Highland Kingdoms|highlanders]] live in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]], and have spread down the valleys of the great rivers: the [[River Semb|Semb]], the [[River Volta|Volta]], the [[River Teft|Teft]], and the [[River Wistel|Wistel]]. Along the coast, [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] mariners raid, intermarry, and settle amongst the highlanders, and a Skaer-dominated mixed culture spreads from [[Tollen]] to the mouth of the [[River Semb|Semb]]. The once mighty [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] swamps have mostly disappeared, save for a remanent, [[Ozabal]], at the mouth of the [[River Wistel|Wistel]], where a thriving lizardfolk community remains. South of the Wistel is the small realm of [[Tyrwingha]], under the protection of [[Archfey Ethlenn]] since before the Downfall.

# The Drankorian Age
DR 431 - DR 1059
### Overview
By DR 431, when the Drankorian army retreated from [[Zovcka]], the borders of Drankor in the east were established, and would not change for many generations. Drankor ruled all the lands between the [[Sentinel Range]] and the [[Western Gulf]] south of the [[River Semb|Semb]]. North of the [[River Semb|Semb]], Drankor ruled the the region south and west of the [[Volta]], as far north as the [[Braebine Hills]]. 

The Drankorians brought modern roads, improved agricultural techniques, and a new religion to the land. Farming and pastoralism was a way of life here, with little technology and little trade. No great wars were fought, the scholars say, and over the generations the old ways were forgotten. [[Mos Numena]] spread rapidly, and the old [[Kestavo|Kestavan]] traditions were largely forgotten.

# The Plague Years

###
DR 1142: [[Adrian]] establishes himself in [[Embry]] as the first [[Duchy of Sembara|Duke of Sembara]]

# The Six Duchies
DR 1250 - DR 1400
### Overview
By DR 1250, six great duchies had been established in the lands once ruled by Drankor: [[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], [[Duchy of Wisford|Wisford]], [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]], [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], and [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]]. Each duke was a powerful lord and commanded fealty of barons and lords within their realms. 

%%Then came the Great Plague, and the collapse of the Drankorian Empire that followed. Little is known of the history of these times, but genealogists claim the line of the Dukes of Sembara began in DR 1142, By the 1250s DR, the six duchies ([[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], [[Duchy of Wisford|Wisford]], [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]], [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], and [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]]) were firmly established, and the Duke of [[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]] was acknowledged as the chief amongst them. The other dukes, save [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], acknowledged the feudal overlordship of the Duke of Sembara.

Over the next generation, a series of small summer conquests slowly added territory to the growing Realm of [[Sembara]], as minor lords pledge fealty to the monarch. Some did so because an army of 1000 Sembaran knights showed up at their castle, and they felt they had no choice; others did so to gain protection from their rivals and ensure stability for their people. The dukes of the five duchies and their knights and vassals become rich from these summer conquests as well as the fertile lands and the slow revival of trade in the [[The Green Sea]]. 

By the 1300s DR, the Sembaran monarchy commanded fealty, either directly, from newly minted barons, or indirectly, from lords sworn to the barons and dukes sworn to the crown, from most of the lowlands between the [[River Teft|Teft]] and the [[River Enst|Enst]]. For the next hundred years or so, the [[The Green Sea]] is peaceful and prosperous. [[Sembara]] grows rich on the strength of its agricultural wealth, and its borders solidify: the [[River Teft]] to the north, the [[River Enst]] to the south, with the western border stretching roughly in a line from the source of the [[River Enst|Enst]] through the [[Aine Hills]] to [[Braebein]], the highlands north of [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]].

# The Unification
DR 1400 - DR 1462, 7 Dominick IV - 34 Derik I
### Overview
By the 1400s, a number of regional powers had started to emerge on the borders of [[Sembara]]. In the northwest, from the highland provinces of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], two realms had emerged: [[Lavnoch]] and [[Ardlas]]. Perched on either side of [[Lake Derwent]], they grew rich with the profit of trade over the mountains, but were often in conflict over control of the lake and access to the Dwarven trade.

North of [[Lavnoch]], the brief [[Zovcka|Unified Crown of Zovcka]] had collapsed, and two northern kingdoms emerged: [[Zovcka]], in the north, and [[Breva]], squeezed between [[Braebein]] and the growing power of the Duke of [[Duchy of Arnbury|Arnbury]], the [[Sentinel Range]], and [[Zovcka]]. 

To the northeast, the [[Duchy of Telham]], between the [[River Teft|Teft]] and the [[River Volta|Volta]], commanded the loyalty of many of the small lords along the coast and the rivers, and was closely tied by culture and intermarriage to [[Sembara]].

South of [[Sembara]] were two major powers: the Kingdom of [[Tyrwingha]], which emerged from the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] largely intact and still under the guardianship of the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], and the [[Dominion of Avatus]], a rising military autocracy exerting overlordship of a number of small kingdoms in the [[Mostreve Hills]], growing in power by taxing trade and recruiting mercenaries, largely [[Hobgoblins]].
