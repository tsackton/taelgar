## The Drankorian Conquest
DR 300 - DR 431

### Overview
In the aftermath of [[The Downfall]] the land that will become [[Sembara]] is lightly populated. The [[Kestavo|kestavo-worshipping]] [[Zimkova|Zimka]] live in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]], and have spread amongst the highlands, and down the valleys of the great rivers: the [[Semb]], the [[Volta]], the [[Teft]], and the [[Wistel]]. Along the coast, [[Skaer]] mariners raid, intermarry, and settle amongst the Zimka, and a Skaer-dominated mixed culture spreads from [[Tollen]] to the mouth of the [[Semb]]. The once mighty [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] swamps have mostly disappeared, save for remnants: [[Ozabal]], at the mouth of the [[Wistel]] and [[Latazaro]], in the east, where a thriving lizardfolk communities remain. South of the Wistel is the mixed community of humans, clustered along the coast, united by the their shared allegiance to the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], but otherwise the southern lands are largely empty of humans. 

Over a series of start-and-start campaigns over 60 years, the Drankorian armies conquer large portions of this land.

## The Drankorian Age
DR 431 - DR 1059
### Overview
By DR 431, when the Drankorian army retreated from [[Zimkova]], the borders of Drankor in the east were established, and would not change for many generations. Drankor ruled all the lands between the [[Sentinel Range]] and the [[Western Gulf]] south of the [[Semb]], as well as the lowlands east of the [[Braebein]] and the lowland valleys of the [[Teft]] and [[Volta]]. The borders of the modern duchies of Telham and Arnsbury still trace to the farthest extent of the Drankorian conquest, as does the borders of Ardlas. 

The Drankorians brought modern roads, improved agricultural techniques, and a new religion to the land. Farming and pastoralism was a way of life here, with little technology and little trade. Across the "Sembaran" provinces (which included the modern day [[Sembara]], [[Ardlas]], [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], [[Addermarch]], and [[Tyrwingha]]), [[Mos Numena]] spread, and a common language and culture grew, and the old [[Kestavo|Kestavan]] traditions were largely forgotten.

In the highlands, the [[Zimkova|Zimka]] kept the old ways, although along the borders with Drankor Mos Numena and Drankorian culture spread. 

## The Plague Years
DR 1059 - DR 1250
### Overview
In DR 1059, the [[First Plague]] came and the Drankorian Empire collapsed. Little information survives from these years, and it was a time of much hardship, especially amongst the more populous lowland regions, where famine struck repeatedly. This was a dark time.

* (DR:: 1142): [[Adrian]] establishes himself in [[Embry]] as the first [[Duchy of Sembara|Duke of Sembara]]

## The Six Duchies
DR 1250 - DR 1400
### Overview
By DR 1250, a number of lords, mostly calling themselves dukes, had established themselves across the lands once ruled by Drankor. In the lowland coastal regions, the six duchies that later would form the heartlands of Sembara had been established: [[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], [[Duchy of Wisford|Wisford]], [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]], [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], and [[Duchy of Arnsbury|Arnsbury]]. Further east and south, [[Tyrwingha]] had emerged from the chaos under the leadership of the [[Oracle of the Riven]] and [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. And to the west, two border duchies had emerged: [[Marches of Brovna|Brovna]], at the headwaters of the [[Wistel]] around [[Urlich Pass]], and [[Ardlas]], along the south banks of the [[Semb]], centered around [[~LakeDerwentCity~]],  the great trading city on [[Lake Derwent]]. 

To the far south, the fertile lands of the [[Istabor Alliance]] beckoned, and much marginal land was abandoned in these years. But by 1250, the land is prospering and, from the scattered duchies that arose from Drankor, population begins to grow and spread.

Along the borders of [[Marches of Brovna|Brovna]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], [[Duchy of Wisford|Wisford]], [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], and [[Duchy of Arnsbury|Arnsbury]], a slow process of expansion began. As the peaceful years continued, and the population grew, the powerful dukes claimed new lands, largely empty, and granted baronies to their favored courtiers. 

One of these noble families, the [[House of Entranca]], the Dukes of Sembara from the early 1300s, slowly grew in influence and power. The Duke of Sembara had emerged from the dark years with the largest and richest demesne of any of the duchies, and had always controlled [[Embry]], the ancient seat of the Drankorian regional government. Over the early 1300s, a series of minor crises and succession disagreements allowed the Entranca's to gain the loyalty of the the Dukes of Wisford, Cheimin, and Seham, who started more and more looking towards Sembara to resolve disputes and provide money and arms when dangerous forces appeared on their doorsteps.

By the end of the 1300s, the Duke of Sembara was broadly acknowledged as feudal lord by the Dukes of Chemin, Seham, and Wistford as well as many of the barons along the south banks of the Enst, the Aine Hills, and the lands between the Wistel and the Enst as far west as the Cleenseau Wood. 

%% The above section could use a bit more clarifying details, and there should be at least one major crisis that drives increasing support for the House of Entranca and the Dukes of Sembara, but the specifics are not something I feel like making up right now 

The intention is that in 1400, there is broadly:
* Two highland realms: Ardlas and Lavnoch, each with a fairly different character
	* Ardlas is Mos Numena, although with strong kestavan influences than elsewhere in Sembara, and broadly culturally aligned with Sembara, speaks the same language, but with an independent monarch and a very different system of government. This was originally a Drankorian province
	* Lavnoch is kestavan and largely speaks Zimkan, having never been a Drankorian province. Has close ties to dwarven kingdoms, and is culturally aligned with the rest of Zimkova
* The larger mass of Zimkova, with a TBD culture, but definitely not a kingdom per se
* The Duchy of Brovna, based around Urlich Pass, very culturally aligned with Sembara, but independent and not acknowledging the Sembaran overlordship, and growing rich on the trade links that are being established with Chardon. Possibly somewhat Swiss inspired, with many independent cantons/villages and a very weak Duke. This place doesn't have to be very well developed as it gets entirely destroyed in the Great War
* Tyrwingha, an independent fey-tinged place ruled by an elected monarch and Ethlenn's guidance
* The core Sembaran duchies

### Overview
By the 1400s, a number of regional powers had started to emerge on the borders of [[Sembara]]. In the northwest, from the broad lands of [[Zimkova]], the realm of [[Lavnoch]] has emerged from the collapse of the short lived [[Zimkova|Unifed Crown of Zimkova]]. 

The [[Duchy of Telham]], between the [[Teft]] and the [[Volta]], had grown substantially, and commanded the loyalty of many of the small lords along the coast and the river, but was closely tied by culture and intermarriage to [[Sembara]].

In the west, the Duchy of Brovna had grown into a significant presence along the mountains, trading eagerly with the growing city of Chardon, and [[Ardlas]] was growing as well, trading with dwarves.

South of [[Sembara]] were two major powers: the Kingdom of [[Tyrwingha]], which emerged from the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] largely intact and still under the guardianship of the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], and the [[Dominion of Avatus]], a rising military autocracy exerting overlordship of a number of scattered baronies and small lordships in the [[Mostreve Hills]], growing in power by taxing trade and recruiting mercenaries, largely [[Hobgoblins]].

Into this moment, [[Derik I]], of a cadet branch of the [[House of Entranca]], establishes the modern Sembara after the defeat of the [[Dominion of Avatus]].

By 1462, on [[Derik I|Derik I's]] death, the royal prerogatives of the monarch of Sembara are well established.

%%
Background - this is old and not incorporated into proper articles and such, but the flavor is intended to be canonical even if some of the details are not necessarily.

While [[Sembara]] thrived during the long peace, underneath, the seeds of conflict grew. The times of peace discouraged unity, and many of the dukes questioned the purpose of the monarch in Embry. Crushing tariffs on Dwarven goods enriched the dukes, but alienated many others, including [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]], who had traditionally enjoyed strong trade relations with [[Sembara]]. And prophets throughout [[Tyrwingha]] were preaching of the End Times, and whole villages were found to have disappeared. Whether fled to the safety of the [[Feywild]] or consumed by darkness, few could answer.

In DR 1425, [[Avatus|Avatus]] saw an opportunity. With a mercenary army consisting largely of [[Hobgoblins]] and vicious werewolves, he launched an invasion across the [[Enst]]. A series of disasters befell the Sembarans -- the Duke of [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimin]] refused to march his troops south of the [[Wistel]], three hundred knights from [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]] were lost in a summer storm at sea, and the muster of [[Duchy of Arnsbury|Arnsbury]] sent only half the men due to crown, claiming insufficient horses. And the expected help from [[Tyrwingha]] fails to materialize -- the Queen herself commanded her knights to stay within the Tyrwinghan borders. And so the Sembaran army, defeated on the field, retreated with half its force to winter north of the [[Wistel]], and [[Avatus|Avatus]] paused to consolidate his gains, and prepared to strike north and east.

Into this moment rode [[Derik I]], a distant relative of the current king, but far from the kingship himself. He had married the second daughter of the Duchess of [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], on [[Northlands]] coast, and had made a name for himself as a military commander in a series of skirmishes against pirates, in alliance with [[Tollen]] mercenaries and halflings.

In the months following the advance of [[Avatus|Avatus]] to the [[Wistel]], a lizardfolk elder had approached Derik, and told him of an omen: he was prophesied to raise a mighty [[Sembara]] to form a pillar of strength in the dark times to come, and if he did not overthrow [[Avatus|Avatus]], the smallest cloud in the coming storm, the darkest shadows of today would seem like the brightest diamonds of tomorrow. But it was also foretold, this elder said, that only the Queen of the Evening Mist could herald his coming.  

With the blessing of his mother-in-law, Derik sent a small tithe of the knights of the [[Duchy of Telham]] south to aid their ally, the King, and then he sailed with the bulk of the duchy’s forces to [[Tyrwingha]]. There, the old queen had been wracked by dreams of the horrible fate that would befall [[Tyrwingha]] if she entered the war, and so had kept her forces away, despite her misgivings for not aiding an ally.

When Derik arrived in [[Tyrwingha]], he immediately disembarked and spoke with the queen. It is said that as he set foot on Tyrwinghan shores, the morning fog parted, and turned golden where he stepped, leaving a trail of sparklingly mist behind him. Crowds began to follow, and when he reached the castle, the people of [[Tyrwingha]] were watching as he bowed his head humbly to ask to speak with the queen, and [[Archfey Ethlenn]] herself appeared before him, and proclaimed that he would be the savior of [[Tyrwingha]], and kissed him on the forehead, passing him her blessing.   

As news spread like wildfire of a knight from the north who had been blessed by Ethlenn herself, Derik was quickly proclaimed [[Derik I]], King of [[Tyrwingha]] by the [[Oracle of the Riven]]. Derik gathered an army of lizardfolk, the knights of Telham and [[Tyrwingha]], the fey-touched warlocks of the Ethlenn, and [[Tollen]] and [[Vostok]] mercenaries, which he marched west in the early spring of 1426. Derik drove the forces of [[Avatus|Avatus]] before him, and his army is flanked on the banks of the [[Wistel]] and decisively defeated by Derik at the Battle of Wisford. 

By the end of the summer of 1428, the war was over. Derik’s alliance, following the initial success of the Battle of Wisford in 1426, which broke [[Avatus|Avatus]]' lines on the [[Wistel]], and the Battle of Fellburn in 1427, which forced [[Avatus|Avatus]] across the [[Enst]], won a decisive and complete victory at the Battle of Dalfield, in the northern Mosteve Hills, in the spring of 1428.   

Cloaked in glory and honor from his decisive military leadership and fey-enhanced charisma, Derik forged modern [[Sembara]] at the Treaty of Wisford, signed in the late fall of 1428 DR, which established the Royal Council, codified the independence of lizardfolk in the realm forevermore, and cemented the [[House of Sewick]] as the rulers of the Joined Crowns of [[Sembara]], [[Tyrwingha]], and [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]].  

In the spring and summer of 1429, Derik, now styling himself [[Derik I]] of [[House of Sewick|Sewick]], King of [[Sembara]], Duke of Telham, High Prince of [[Tyrwingha]], Honored Consort of the Queen of the Evening Mist, and Defender of the Four Rivers, marches his army throughout the [[Mostreve Hills]], driving out the last of the [[Hobgoblins]] and accepting the fealty of the local lords. 

In the fall of 1429, the Treaty of [[Valarin]] (a small town in the “gap” in the southern highlands) establishes relations between [[Sembara]] and the [[Istabor Alliance]], a loose confederation of city states and freeholds to the south that is emerging out of the fall of the [[Dominion of Avatus]], setting the extent of [[Sembara]]’s control at the southern edge of the [[Mostreve Hills]].

## The Great War
DR 1462 - DR 1545; 1 Derik II - 26 Derik III

The reign of [[Derik II]] is relatively uneventful, and the traditions and formalities of the realm are established and propagated in this time. The borders to the south, with the [[Istabor Alliance]], and the north, with the fractured fiefdoms of [[Vostok]], are uneventful, and trading relationships with [[Cymea]], [[Tollen]], and the rest of the eastern [[Green Sea]] grow during this time. 
#### Tensions in the North

The only thing that mars the peace of this era is increasing tensions among the Zimka. Several small wars break out between [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]], fighting over control of the headwaters of the Semb and [[Lake Derwent]], and with it access to the lucrative Dwarven trade. Although the violence never spills over into Sembara, trade is disrupted and what to do about the highlands is a constant question during the reign of [[Derik II]]. [[Derik II]], although a strong king and diplomat, is not the military leader his father was, and was reluctant to raise taxes for an invasion.  

Several times the dwarves send diplomatic missions to Sembara, asking the king to deal with the humans making trouble, and several times Derik II says there is nothing he can do. By the 1490s, it is clear the situation is untenable, as at this point both the halflings and dwarves are complaining to the king and telling him to get these unruly humans under control before they take it into their own hands, to ensure stability, but at this point Derik II is old, and uncertain, and so nothing is done.

[[Charlotte I]], Derik II’s daughter, inherits the crisis. Unwilling to let relations with the dwarves deteriorate further, Charlotte rides with a large army up the River Semb, and in a relatively bloodless series of campaigns forces [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]] to the negotiating table, asserting suzerainty over the territory of these kingdoms. Soon after, in 1508 DR, rumors of something terrible in the north are growing. 
#### The Preamble to the Great War

After his defeat as the hidden puppet master of [[Dominion of Avatus]], [[Cha'mutte]] has turned his attention north, where far across the [[Sentinel Range]] he is growing an empire. Still maintaining footholds in the southern [[Sentinel Range]] where several loyal hobgoblin tribes attempt to prevent the consolidation of the [[Istabor Alliance]] into a united front, he has turned his attention to a move from the north, through the empty northern steppes. Still working through proxies, and not ready to show himself yet, he summoned one of his dragonspawn, the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and set him to gather allies across the northern plains -- orcs, monstrosities, ogres, and trolls -- and set upon Vostok and Zimkova from the north. 

%% Needs thought 
At the same time, a group of religious fanatics worshipping the children of [[Vacla]]  began to establish themselves in [[Zimkova]] and the Volta borderlands in Vostok, taking control of [[Zimkova]] and persecuting followers of the Eightfold Way.  
%%

Derik III, 19 years old in 1508 DR, is sent to the north. Vostok at this point is ruled in the east by descendants of Skaer raiders, in the lakes region along the Volta increasingly by [[Zimkova]], around Tollen largely as an oligarchy of rich merchants, and to the north as a loose confederation of semi-nomadic tribes. Derik III, channeling the charisma of his great-grandfather, cloaked in the blessing of the Gods, leads a grand alliance north to repair the ancient wall and defeat the dragon. In response, he is acknowledged as Prince of the North, and when he comes to the throne he is acknowledged as high king by the people of Vostok. Tollen retains its charter as a free city, but acknowledges the suzerainty of Derik III. 

%%  Needs thought 
While this is a great victory, in the meantime the situation has deteriorated in Zimkova, especially the north. The religious cult has come to fully control Zimkova, and citizens of Breva are pissed that Sembara ignored their plight and suffering to fight battles in foreign lands. 

In DR 1511, Derik III, still Prince and Heir, leads a campaign to the highlands. The conquest is bitter, as Breva descends into civil war with some of the people on the side of Sembara and others on the side of OldGod. Sembara prevails, and forces of OldGod flee to Zimkova, but the price is high, and Derik III does not pursue military conquest of Zimkova.   

In DR 1523, shortly after Derik III comes to the throne, he finally launches a campaign against OldGod (perhaps now revealed to be stoked/encouraged by Cha’mutte), with the aid and support of the local lords on the Vostok side of the Volta. Zimkova is defeated, but worshippers of OldGod slip into hiding. Zimkova nominally acknowledges the overlordship of Sembara, but the local lords are not replaced, only forced to renounce OldGod. 

%%

By DR 1525, Derik III is at least nominally acknowledged as the overlord and high king of all the land from the southern highlands to the northern wall, from [[Sentinel Range]] to the [[Western Gulf]].  In DR 1533, now several years a widower, Derik III marries Jane, the young daughter of an important merchant family in Tollen. 

Over the next 20 years, Sembara remains a strong and united kingdom as various conflicts spread along its borders, culminating in the [[Great War]].

## The Peace of Cece
DR 1650 - DR 1713; 2 Cece I - 65 Cece 1
### Overview
In the autumn of 1650, after three summers of campaigning, the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] has been cleansed from the land. Three years prior, a hobgoblin dominion stretched in the Enst valley, from the [[Sentinel Range]] to the headwaters of the Aure in Addermarch, and even northwards into the Barony of Varbonne. It is now gone, although people have only slowly started returning to the war-torn lands.

The reign of [[Cece I]] is a time of peace and prosperity. The borders are secure, trade is growing, and Sembara's relations with its neighbors are friendly, and the hobgoblin threat, although not entirely gone, is isolated to [[Western Marches|the Western Marches]].
