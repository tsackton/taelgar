## The Drankorian Conquest
DR 300 - DR 431

### Overview
In the aftermath of [[The Downfall]] the land that will become [[Sembara]] is lightly populated. The [[Kestavo|kestavo-worshipping]] [[Zimkova|Zimka]] live in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]], and have spread amongst the highlands, and down the valleys of the great rivers: the [[Semb]], the [[Volta]], the [[Teft]], and the [[Wistel]]. Along the coast, [[Skaer]] mariners raid, intermarry, and settle amongst the Zimka, and a Skaer-dominated mixed culture spreads from [[Tollen]] to the mouth of the [[Semb]]. The once mighty [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] swamps have mostly disappeared, save for remnants: [[Ozabal]], at the mouth of the [[Wistel]] and [[Latazaro]], in the east, where a thriving lizardfolk communities remain. South of the Wistel is the mixed community of humans, clustered along the coast, united by the their shared allegiance to the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], but otherwise the southern lands are largely empty of humans. 

Over a series of start-and-start campaigns over 60 years, the Drankorian armies occupy large portions of this land. %% what this "conquest" looks like in practice is unclear, and may involve Sembarans willing or even eagerly joining the Drankorian Empire; the existence of the two treaties below is canonical but they are not necessarily the result of war %%
###

* (DR:: 468): (The Drankorian [[Highland Conquest Wars]] end with a tactical retreat by Drankor) %% while the fact that the highlands were never incorporated into the Drankorian Empire is canonical, the existence of the Highland Conquest wars as the reason is not %%

## The Drankorian Age
DR 431 - DR 1059
### Overview

(By DR 431, when the Drankorian army retreated from [[Zimkova]], the borders of Drankor in the east were established, and would not change for many generations). %% both timing and exact nature of Drankor's "retreat" from the highlands is unclear%%

Drankor ruled all the lands between the [[Sentinel Range]] and the [[Western Gulf]] south of the [[Semb]], as well as the lowlands east of the [[Braebein]] and the lowland valleys of the [[Teft]] and [[Volta]]. (The borders of the modern duchies of Telham and Arnsbury still trace to the farthest extent of the Drankorian conquest, as does the borders of Ardlas.) %% this is probably actively wrong; given upheavals in century after DR 1059 there is probably not much continuity in borders, though there may be impacts on spread of Mos Numena and languages c.f. the lack of alignment between Roman and Carolingian borders in Germany %%

The Drankorians brought modern roads, improved agricultural techniques, and a new religion to the land. Farming and pastoralism was a way of life here, with little technology and little trade. Across the "Sembaran" provinces (which included the modern day [[Sembara]], [[Ardlas]], [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], [[Addermarch]], and [[Tyrwingha]]), [[Mos Numena]] spread, and a common language and culture grew, and the old [[Kestavo|Kestavan]] traditions were largely forgotten. %% possibly incomplete, though maybe not relevant - would, e.g. Maseau area be included in the "Sembaran" provinces? It might not really matter except as a way to delineate language development post-Drankor %%

In the highlands, the [[Zimkova|Zimka]] kept the old ways, although along the borders with Drankor Mos Numena and Drankorian culture spread. 

%% Basic idea should be canonical; the exact interaction between Drankor and Zimka - and if there was even a retreat or attempt to conqueor Zimka - should not be considered canon %%
## The Plague Years
DR 1059 - DR 1250
### Overview
In DR 1059, the [[First Plague]] came and the Drankorian Empire collapsed. Little information survives from these years, and it was a time of much hardship, especially amongst the more populous lowland regions, where famine struck repeatedly. This was a dark time.

%% some thought needs to be given to how the history in the Plague Years plays out w/r/t language family development, as this sets the seeds for divergence of Drankorian dialects into full-blown languages; c.f. [[Languages]] and [[Language - Discussions]], especially the spread of Sembaran which is an Eastros language; implies to me a strong barrier around Maseau / Enst and significant Tollish influence in Sembara in Plague Years %%

* ((DR:: 1142)): [[Adrian]] establishes himself in [[Embry]] as the first [[Duchy of Sembara|Duke of Sembara]] %% not obvious date is canonical, but could be? %%

## The Six Duchies
DR 1250 - DR 1400
### Overview
By DR 1250, a number of lords, mostly calling themselves dukes, had established themselves across the lands once ruled by Drankor. In the lowland coastal regions, the six  duchies had been established: [[Duchy of Sembara|Sembara]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], [[Duchy of Wisford|Wisford]], [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]], [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], and [[Duchy of Arnsbury|Arnsbury]]. Further east and south, [[Tyrwingha]] had survived the dark years under the leadership of the [[Oracle of the Riven]] and [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. And to the west, sheltered in the eaves of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] by the great dwarven kingdom of [[Khatridun]], three border duchies had emerged: [[Marches of Brovna|Brovna]], at the headwaters of the [[Wistel]] around [[Urlich Pass]], [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], at the headwaters of the [[Enst]], [[Ardlas]], along the [[Bollin]].

The [[Duchy of Sembara]] was the largest and richest demesne of any of the duchies, and had always controlled [[Embry]], (the only surviving ancient seat of the Drankorian regional government,) and even by DR 1250, the Dukes of Sembara were styling themselves Kings (or Queens)(, and commanded the fealty of the duchies of [[Arnsbury]], [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimen]], and [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]]). Although the names of the earliest monarchs are lost, by the early 1300s, the [[House of Entranca]] rules Sembara. %% it is not obvious to me that Sembara must command the loyalty of Arnsbury, Cheimen, and Sehman at the beginning of this period; these places are extremely lightly developed, often little more than a name, and it does not seem crucial to commit to a specific timing of this unification process right now. what does matter is that by the time Derik I goes to war against Avatus, only Telham, Sembara, and Wisford remain to be unified %%


%% Tim: I rewrote this section above and believe the above should be considered canonical. I've made the details fairly light %%
%% @Mike: though i'm not sure the timing is canonical, I think the idea that the Six Duchies, Brovna, Maseau, and Ardlas are established in the 1059-1353 timeline is important; I would contrast with Addermarch and Tyrwingha, which I think are *older* units that were administered by Drankor but actually in some sense predate Drankor, and largely due to geography, culture, and in Tyrwingha's case the fey, don't have a lot of border shifts. %%

#### Undated Giant Events
(these could fit into the general 1059-1350 timeline somewhere)

@Tim I think the giant / dragon battle below  works better for Telham or Seham, or perhaps 1090 and 1250. Maybe the dragon is why none of the regional capitals survived except Embry

@Mike I invented this event when I was making up stories of giants for each player, way back during the first Hralgar arc. Does not need to be canonical, but if it is, it could be an option for an event that solidifies Entranca. The details would have to be tweaked a bit, but of course the halflings might remember the halflings role more vividly than the human armies

In the memories and lives of the Goodbarrels of the Green Sea, the storm giants loom the largest. Tales tell of vast undersea palaces, so big that they disturb the currents above, but rarely, if ever, do the denizens of these kingdoms venture to the surface. Still, when a particularly bad storm races across the sea, it is hard not to wonder if some angry storm giant is responsible. 

One story of giants does loom large in the ocean of memories of your people. Long ago, before the Great War, in the time after the fall of the Drankorian Empire when much was unsettled in the Green Sea, was the Year of Endless Thunder. 

The stories, as is the case for many halfling stories, are somewhat lacking in detail: after the fall of the Drankorian Empire, a petty king in the area now Sembara made a pact with a dragon, grew in power, until he was betrayed and the dragon ruled with an iron fist, demanding tribute in slaves and treasure from all under his sway, until the people of the Green Sea, led by seagoing peoples who had escaped the worst (the halflings and the Skagish) turned in desperation to the power of the sea, and out of the waves the giant Sigga strode to battle the dragon. 

The memories, however, are vivid: 

Human soldiers wearing red scale armor rushing aboard a ship at dock, seizing not just the goods but people, threatening with sword and bow, too many to fight, marching in chains, tired, until finally you are kneeling before a great beast, scaled and red with eyes of black and gold and flame, immense and looming over you, as realization dawns that you are going to die here, but at least you are not alone as your soul drifts into the embrace of your ancestors as the flames wash around you.

On a ship in a storm, sailing against all sense into the heart of the winds, battered and buffeted by waves towering over the masts, halfling crew working with human crew to keep the ship afloat, the captain shouting commands as you scurry to secure a line, until suddenly all is calm and out of the sea a person emerges - but not a person, vast in scale, almost ten times bigger than a halfling, long silver hair tied in a topknot, a grim face, as she speaks in a booming voice, “I am Sigga. I have seen the threads of our fates intertwined, growing strong or fading as one. Come, we must discuss,” as a pale blue glow washes over the captain and his human first mate, and they sink below the waves to bargain with the giant.

A powerful storm, a hurricane of epic proportions, battering a line of soldiers in red scale armor manning coastal fortifications. Other humans, in light armor with axes and wooden shields rushing the beach. Behind them, Sigga striding onto land, nearly 30’ tall, the wind and waves following her command. With Sigga, a grim battalion of halflings, many with bows and shortswords, but in the front one carrying no visible weapons. As Sigga strides forward, tossing giant rocks at the stone walls of the fort, you feel the power of the storm rushing through you, lightning gathering in your mind, unleashing a bolt to strike down your enemies as the epic battle of Sigga against a dragon rages above you.


A cold morning on a wavy beach, waking at dawn, offering a word of thanks to Sigga the giant beneath the waves, a wild storm passing offshore, flashes of lightning and peals of thunder seeming to acknowledge your presence, as if the storm itself were the manifestation of Sigga herself.

%%^Campaign:none%%

(from Tim):
Maybe this is too directly lifted from the unification of England, but I'd actually propose a slight restructuring of the framework here. I would split the narrative post-Drankor into two phases, from 1059-1353 and then from 1353-1462. The first period starts with the fall of Drankor and ends with Avatus' first war against the north; the second period then picks up and ends with Derik I's death. This kind of mirrors the Heptarchy -> Unification with Avatus kind of playing the role of the Danes. 

But the logic of this split is that the only part of this history that really has come up in games is the timing around Avatus' wars and the reign of Derik I (per my addermarch development and your history of cleenseau notes). There are some constraints that are important, such as the final unification of Sembara happening via Derik I unifying crowns of Telham and Sembara; then being crowned in Tyrwingha and defeating Avatus, which brings Brovna and Wisford and Maseau into the kingdom. 

This implies that by 1422, when the final war starts, there are five important duchies: Sembara, Telham, Wisford, Brovna, and Maseau. It is also important that Sembara be the more important than Telham, so that the modern-day realm is called Sembara (e.g. Derik I has to be perceived as bringing Telham under Sembaran rule, not the reverse). But it doesn't really put any constraints on exactly which of the minor duchies owes allegiance to who, and when those allegiances were given (e.g., it is perfectly consistent IMO that one of the minor duchies owes allegiance to Wisford). 

(from Mike originally):
The intention is that in 1350ish, when the second of Avatus' wars start, there is broadly:

* Three highland border duchies, from north to south:
	* Ardlas, is Mos Numena, although with strong kestavan influences than elsewhere in Sembara, and broadly culturally aligned with Sembara, speaks the same language. This was originally a Drankorian province. Not part of Sembara.
	* Brovna, based around Urlich Pass, very culturally aligned with Sembara, but independent and not acknowledging the Sembaran overlordship, and growing rich on the trade links that are being established with Chardon. Possibly somewhat Swiss inspired, with many independent cantons/villages and a very weak Duke. This place doesn't have to be very well developed as it gets entirely destroyed in the Great War
	* Maseau, the farest south of the duchies, based around the Enst, witih an undefined by basically Sembaran culture and religion

* The larger mass of Zimkova, likely not a kingdom, although the Great Chasm exists and Lavnoch and Breva might both have various proto-development in this period. 
* Tyrwingha, an independent fey-tinged place ruled by an elected monarch and Ethlenn's guidance
* The core Sembaran duchies (Seham, Cheimen, Sembara, Arnsbury) under the Sembaran crown
* Wisford, in the south, growing and powerful and clearly independent (although sharing a culture with Sembara)
* Telham, in the north, growing and powerful and clearly independent (with a Tollish culture)

@Tim: I think the above is basically canonical although does not need to be committed to beyond what you need for Avatus history

@Mike: per my comment above, I think (a) this also needs Addermarch added, and (b) it is not obvious that Sembara must command the allegiance of Seham, Cheimen, and Arnsbury in 1353.

## The Unification
DR 1400 - DR 1462, 7 Dominick IV - 34 Derik I

%% See [[Cleenseau History Notes]] for some details on how this and later sections played out in Cleenseau. It should be consitent but continuity errors should be resolved in favor of Cleenseau History Notes %%
### Overview
By the 1400s, a number of regional powers had started to emerge on the borders of [[Sembara]]. 

The [[Duchy of Telham]], between the [[Teft]] and the [[Volta]], had grown substantially, and commanded the loyalty of many of the small lords along the coast and the river, but was closely tied by culture and intermarriage to [[Sembara]].

In the west, the Duchy of Brovna had grown into a significant presence along the mountains, trading eagerly with the powerful city of Chardon, and [[Ardlas]] was growing as well, trading with dwarves.

%%@Mike for context, Chardon begins to grow as an industrial power in the 1200s, with the paper and magical scroll industry taking off in the 1350s  - so this works well with increasing trade 

@Tim: I like Ardlas as the "Sembaran-Zimkova" melting pot that really is trading with dwarves and might have a bit of the Dale vibe. I think it is considerably less Zimkovan than the rest of Zimka

%%

South of [[Sembara]] were two major powers: the Kingdom of [[Tyrwingha]], which emerged from the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] largely intact and still under the guardianship of the [[Archfey Ethlenn]], and the [[Dominion of Avatus]], a rising military autocracy exerting overlordship of a number of scattered baronies and small lordships in the [[Mostreve Hills]], growing in power by taxing trade and recruiting mercenaries, largely [[Hobgoblins]].

%% The above section is NOT canon; needs revision based on Avatus and Addermarch development  %%

%% None of the dates above need to be canon except 1425 King of Tyrwingha  although I think the general vibe is correct, as is the idea of Derik I establishing a bunch of duchies in old Avatus lands in the 1430s or late 1420s. The dates for Battle of Fellburn, Battle of Stavenford, and Battle of Wisford can move +/- 1-2 years but should be relatively close to the above, and the battles are canon %%

By 1462, on [[Derik I|Derik I's]] death, the royal prerogatives of the monarch of Sembara are well established.

%%
Background - this is old and not incorporated into proper articles and such, but the flavor is intended to be canonical even if some of the details are not necessarily.

While [[Sembara]] thrived during the long peace, underneath, the seeds of conflict grew. The times of peace discouraged unity, and many of the dukes questioned the purpose of the monarch in Embry. Crushing tariffs on Dwarven goods enriched the dukes, but alienated many others, including [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]], who had traditionally enjoyed strong trade relations with [[Sembara]]. And prophets throughout [[Tyrwingha]] were preaching of the End Times, and whole villages were found to have disappeared. Whether fled to the safety of the [[Feywild]] or consumed by darkness, few could answer.

In DR 1425, [[Avatus|Avatus]] saw an opportunity. With a mercenary army consisting largely of [[Hobgoblins]] and vicious werewolves, he launched an invasion across the [[Enst]]. A series of disasters befell the Sembarans -- the Duke of [[Duchy of Cheimen|Cheimin]] refused to march his troops south of the [[Wistel]], three hundred knights from [[Duchy of Seham|Seham]] were lost in a summer storm at sea, and the muster of [[Duchy of Arnsbury|Arnsbury]] sent only half the men due to crown, claiming insufficient horses. And the expected help from [[Tyrwingha]] fails to materialize -- the Queen herself commanded her knights to stay within the Tyrwinghan borders. And so the Sembaran army, defeated on the field, retreated with half its force to winter north of the [[Wistel]], and [[Avatus|Avatus]] paused to consolidate his gains, and prepared to strike north and east.

Into this moment rode [[Derik I]], a distant relative of the current king, but far from the kingship himself. He had married the second daughter of the Duchess of [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]], on [[Northlands]] coast, and had made a name for himself as a military commander in a series of skirmishes against pirates, in alliance with [[Tollen]] mercenaries and halflings.

In the months following the advance of [[Avatus|Avatus]] to the [[Wistel]], a lizardfolk elder had approached Derik, and told him of an omen: he was prophesied to raise a mighty [[Sembara]] to form a pillar of strength in the dark times to come, and if he did not overthrow [[Avatus|Avatus]], the smallest cloud in the coming storm, the darkest shadows of today would seem like the brightest diamonds of tomorrow. But it was also foretold, this elder said, that only the Queen of the Evening Mist could herald his coming.  

With the blessing of his mother-in-law, Derik sent a small tithe of the knights of the [[Duchy of Telham]] south to aid their ally, the King, and then he sailed with the bulk of the duchy’s forces to [[Tyrwingha]]. There, the old queen had been wracked by dreams of the horrible fate that would befall [[Tyrwingha]] if she entered the war, and so had kept her forces away, despite her misgivings for not aiding an ally.

When Derik arrived in [[Tyrwingha]], he immediately disembarked and spoke with the queen. It is said that as he set foot on Tyrwinghan shores, the morning fog parted, and turned golden where he stepped, leaving a trail of sparklingly mist behind him. Crowds began to follow, and when he reached the castle, the people of [[Tyrwingha]] were watching as he bowed his head humbly to ask to speak with the queen, and [[Archfey Ethlenn]] herself appeared before him, and proclaimed that he would be the savior of [[Tyrwingha]], and kissed him on the forehead, passing him her blessing.   

As news spread like wildfire of a knight from the north who had been blessed by Ethlenn herself, Derik was quickly proclaimed [[Derik I]], King of [[Tyrwingha]] by the [[Oracle of the Riven]]. Derik gathered an army of lizardfolk, the knights of Telham and [[Tyrwingha]], the fey-touched warlocks of the Ethlenn, and [[Tollen]] and [[Vostok]] mercenaries, which he marched west in the early spring of 1426. Derik drove the forces of [[Avatus|Avatus]] before him, and his army is flanked on the banks of the [[Wistel]] and decisively defeated by Derik at the Battle of Wisford. 

By the end of the summer of 1428, the war was over. Derik’s alliance, following the initial success of the Battle of Wisford in 1426, which broke [[Avatus|Avatus]]' lines on the [[Wistel]], and the Battle of Fellburn in 1427, which forced [[Avatus|Avatus]] across the [[Enst]], won a decisive and complete victory at the Battle of Dalfield, in the northern Mosteve Hills, in the spring of 1428.   

Cloaked in glory and honor from his decisive military leadership and fey-enhanced charisma, Derik forged modern [[Sembara]] at the [[Treaty of Wisford]], signed in the late fall of 1428 DR, which established the Royal Council, codified the independence of lizardfolk in the realm forevermore, and cemented the [[House of Sewick]] as the rulers of the Joined Crowns of [[Sembara]], [[Tyrwingha]], and [[Duchy of Telham|Telham]].  

In the spring and summer of 1429, Derik, now styling himself [[Derik I]] of [[House of Sewick|Sewick]], King of [[Sembara]], Duke of Telham, High Prince of [[Tyrwingha]], Honored Consort of the Queen of the Evening Mist, and Defender of the Four Rivers, marches his army throughout the [[Mostreve Hills]], driving out the last of the [[Hobgoblins]] and accepting the fealty of the local lords. 

In the fall of 1429, the Treaty of [[Valarin]] (a small town in the “gap” in the southern highlands) establishes relations between [[Sembara]] and the [[Istabor Alliance]], a loose confederation of city states and freeholds to the south that is emerging out of the fall of the [[Dominion of Avatus]], setting the extent of [[Sembara]]’s control at the southern edge of the [[Mostreve Hills]].

## The Great War
DR 1462 - DR 1545; 1 Derik II - 26 Derik III

The reign of [[Derik II]] is relatively uneventful, and the traditions and formalities of the realm are established and propagated in this time. The borders to the south, with the [[Istabor Alliance]], and the north, with the fractured fiefdoms of [[Vostok]], are uneventful, and trading relationships with [[Cymea]], [[Tollen]], and the rest of the eastern [[Green Sea]] grow during this time. 
#### Tensions in the North

%% @Tim not clear any of this is canon. It was intended to provide a narrative for why Derik III ruled all of the highland kingdoms, but I'm not sure that is actually even necessarily true. In general I do not think the below fits that well with the vibe of Zimkova and the Great Chasm inventions.  %%

The only thing that mars the peace of this era is increasing tensions among the Zimka. Several small wars break out between [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]], fighting over control of the headwaters of the Semb and [[Lake Derwent]], and with it access to the lucrative Dwarven trade. Although the violence never spills over into Sembara, trade is disrupted and what to do about the highlands is a constant question during the reign of [[Derik II]]. [[Derik II]], although a strong king and diplomat, is not the military leader his father was, and was reluctant to raise taxes for an invasion.  

Several times the dwarves send diplomatic missions to Sembara, asking the king to deal with the humans making trouble, and several times Derik II says there is nothing he can do. By the 1490s, it is clear the situation is untenable, as at this point both the halflings and dwarves are complaining to the king and telling him to get these unruly humans under control before they take it into their own hands, to ensure stability, but at this point Derik II is old, and uncertain, and so nothing is done.

%% @Mike: this may still work, but should be considered in light of Zimkova history. In addition, there is a common thread of "trading cities on Lake Derwent" that I think originally had a kind of Dale vibe but I'm not sure where they stand - not sure the vibe of big trading cities fits the Zimka%%

[[Charlotte I]], Derik II’s daughter, inherits the crisis. Unwilling to let relations with the dwarves deteriorate further, Charlotte rides with a large army up the River Semb, and in a relatively bloodless series of campaigns forces [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]] to the negotiating table, asserting suzerainty over the territory of these kingdoms. Soon after, in 1508 DR, rumors of something terrible in the north are growing. 
#### The Preamble to the Great War

%% @Tim This is in flavor canon, as is Vimfrost's War, but nothing here was intended by me to be canon beyond what you think should be %%

After his defeat as the hidden puppet master of [[Dominion of Avatus]], [[Cha'mutte]] has turned his attention north, where far across the [[Sentinel Range]] he is growing an empire. Still maintaining foo
tholds in the southern [[Sentinel Range]] where several loyal hobgoblin tribes attempt to prevent the consolidation of the [[Istabor Alliance]] into a united front, he has turned his attention to a move from the north, through the empty northern steppes. Still working through proxies, and not ready to show himself yet, he summoned one of his dragonspawn, the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and set him to gather allies across the northern plains -- orcs, monstrosities, ogres, and trolls -- and set upon Vostok and Zimkova from the north. 

%% Needs thought 
At the same time, a group of religious fanatics worshipping the children of [[Vaqar]]  began to establish themselves in [[Zimkova]] and the Volta borderlands in Vostok, taking control of [[Zimkova]] and persecuting followers of the Eightfold Way.  
%%

Derik III, 19 years old in 1508 DR, is sent to the north. Vostok at this point is ruled in the east by descendants of Skaer raiders, in the lakes region along the Volta increasingly by [[Zimkova]], around Tollen largely as an oligarchy of rich merchants, and to the north as a loose confederation of semi-nomadic tribes. Derik III, channeling the charisma of his great-grandfather, cloaked in the blessing of the Gods, leads a grand alliance north to repair the ancient wall and defeat the dragon. In response, he is acknowledged as Prince of the North, and when he comes to the throne he is acknowledged as high king by the people of Vostok. Tollen retains its charter as a free city, but acknowledges the suzerainty of Derik III. 

%%  Needs thought 
While this is a great victory, in the meantime the situation has deteriorated in Zimkova, especially the north. The religious cult has come to fully control Zimkova, and citizens of Breva are pissed that Sembara ignored their plight and suffering to fight battles in foreign lands. 

In DR 1511, Derik III, still Prince and Heir, leads a campaign to the highlands. The conquest is bitter, as Breva descends into civil war with some of the people on the side of Sembara and others on the side of OldGod. Sembara prevails, and forces of OldGod flee to Zimkova, but the price is high, and Derik III does not pursue military conquest of Zimkova.   

In DR 1523, shortly after Derik III comes to the throne, he finally launches a campaign against OldGod (perhaps now revealed to be stoked/encouraged by Cha’mutte), with the aid and support of the local lords on the Vostok side of the Volta. Zimkova is defeated, but worshippers of OldGod slip into hiding. Zimkova nominally acknowledges the overlordship of Sembara, but the local lords are not replaced, only forced to renounce OldGod.

%% The below is canon, but I don't think there is a good story for how Zimkova comes under Derik III. Ardlas is probably just part of Sembara at this point, and Breva is almost certainly only under Derik III during the actual Great War, similar to Vostok. Lavnoch is unclear %%

By DR 1525, Derik III is at least nominally acknowledged as the overlord and high king of all the land from the southern highlands to the northern wall, from [[Sentinel Range]] to the [[Western Gulf]].  In DR 1533, now several years a widower, Derik III marries Jane, the young daughter of an important merchant family in Tollen. 

Over the next 20 years, Sembara remains a strong and united kingdom as various conflicts spread along its borders, culminating in the [[Great War]].

## The Peace of Cece
DR 1650 - DR 1713; 2 Cece I - 65 Cece 1
### Overview
%% everything in this section is basically canonical %%

In the autumn of 1650, after three summers of campaigning, the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] has been cleansed from the land. Three years prior, a hobgoblin dominion stretched in the Enst valley, from the [[Sentinel Range]] to the headwaters of the Aure in Addermarch, and even northwards into the Barony of Varbonne. It is now gone, although people have only slowly started returning to the war-torn lands.

The reign of [[Cece I]] is a time of peace and prosperity. The borders are secure, trade is growing, and Sembara's relations with its neighbors are friendly, and the hobgoblin threat, although not entirely gone, is isolated to [[Western Marches|the Western Marches]]. 
## Recent Events
Since DR 1713 (1 Robert I)
%% everything in this section is basically canonical %%

- (DR:: 1717), fall: [[Robert I|Robert's]] daughter, [[Arabella|Arabella of Sewick]] dies in childbirth, her son apparently possessed by a demon. Rumors spread that [[Cece I|Cece's]] ill luck with children as being passed down to her son.
- (DR:: 1717), late winter: [[Robert I|Robert's]] younger son, [[Thaddeus of Sewick|Thaddeus]] is shipwrecked off the coast of [[Cymea]], with his wife and young child, and is never heard from again

%% Notes on basic canon
In general the Sembaran history was written with the idea of providing a story for how the Sembara of the Great War came to be and then fell apart. I think as we have devloped the history the idea of Sembara as a true major kingdom rather than just the leader of an alliance, has become less important. 

In general, therefore, I think the Great War era Sembara has a couple of types of places:
* Core duchies (Brovna, Maseau, Ardlas, plus rest of Sembara)
* Union of crown (Tyrwingha)
* Temporary overlord (Addermarch, Vostok, Breva)
* Unclear: Lavnoch

The death of Derik III ends the unified rule with Tyrwingha, Vostok, Addermarch, and Breva. Brovna is destoryed by the Great War / Limbo. Maseau and Ardlas are abandoned between the end of the Great War and the Interregun after the almost-war between Anne and Elaine I although exactly when is unclear. Lavnoch is not well defined.
