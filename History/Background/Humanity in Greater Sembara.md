# Humanity in Greater Sembara

This note tries to draw together information from various sources to form a semi-canonical history of humanity in the Greater Sembaran region, intended to inform development of Sembara, Tyrwingha, Maseau, Addermarch, Tollen, Zimkova, and Vostok. Sections in %% notes %% should not be considered canonical. The rest generally is, although this specific background doc is not meant as direct world lore. 

%% Key dates:
1750 Creation of Humans on Hkar (from [[Timeline - Old Notes]])
3902 Founding of Tollen (from [[Tollen]])
4122  the Downfall (from [[Timeline - Old Notes]])
4133 Drankor founded (from [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]])
4535 Drankor has conqueor all of Sembaran (from [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] / [[Treaty of Marhavn]])
%%

%% some notes to consider:
- The cultural context of Tollen is perhaps a little unspecified here. [[Tollen]] has some history that is relevant; in the modern day (post-Great-War) Tollen is fairly distinct, culturally, from Sembara, which is not necessarily well-captured here, although obviously shares some key cultural strands.
- There is some history of the [[Skaer]] that could be usefully considered, as well as some shared discussion about the various strands of expansionism and isolation in Skaer culture
- Cymea does not receive any treatment here, and Isingue minimal treatment but is clearly part of this cultural milieu. I think in past discussions it has been assumed these are more purely Drankorian cultures, but I'm not sure this is canonical. %%
## Context
The most important context for the history of humanity in the Greater Sembara area are the three migrations:

* The northerners who came across the Sentinels from the west, long before the Downfall
* The eastern mariners, who came from the eastern green sea, shortly before the Downfall
* The Drankorians, who came from the south, during the first phase of Drankorian expansion after the Downfall

Each of these waves of migration lead to significant cultural intermixing and the birth of new cultures. 
## Earliest Migrations
The first humans arrived in the Greater Sembaran region in the years between 3450 and 3650 %% this is not necessarily canonical, but it should be somewhat before the founding of Tollen %% from the west, crossing over the Sentinels. These earliest migrants spoke a Northros language, and worshipped in the tradition of the [[Northern Folk Religions]], although the exact details of their culture and language have been lost to time. 

These people spread, eventually settling across a broad swath of Greater Sembara and beyond. At least one strand of this culture crossed the [[Svinjo Mountains]] and would eventually become the [[Vargaldi]], though most probably don't range that far, instead settling among the foothills of the Sentinels along the Volta, Teft, and Semb rivers. Their southward expansion was stopped by the great swamps of the lizardfolk, which dominated the Enst and Wistel valleys at least, and possibly more (the exact extent of the lizardfolk swamps is not determined).

%% What is happening in Vostok is left undetermined  -- this could be another cultural strand of the northerners %%

By 3850 %% approx date - exact dates not determined %% they started to encounter a new human culture, worshipping unfamiliar gods and speaking an unfamiliar tongue. The exact identity of this culture is not determined, but they spoke an Eastros tongue, and worshipped very differently than the Northerners. 

%% the details of this culture, and exactly how it relates to the mariners and the Skaer, are not entirely clear. 

This is clearly a mariner / Eastros culture, but it could be anything from:
- direct ancestors of the Skaer, already worshipping Kaikkea
- a group already split from the Skaer, willing to give up the ocean goddess, or perhaps even actively seeking new gods away from the sea
- something totally different or unexpected

Old Brainstorming:
- These were a mariner culture (likely the ancestors of the Skaer) speaking an Eastros tongue, and worshipping one (or perhaps a pantheon) of the ancient mariner gods. 
- These easterners were themselves split into two distinct cultural groups. The Skaer, already worshipping [[Kaikkea]], and dedicated to the ocean, and the settlers, those willing to give up the life of the mariner for the bountiful lands of the Semb, Teft, and Volta River valleys, and the coasts of Vostok and Sembara.

%%

A third human culture, the Tyrwinghans, was settled in the lands claimed by [[Archfey Ethlenn]] by 4000, although whether there origin was northern, eastern, or something else is not decided. 

So at the time of the Downfall, out of the mixing of these mariner and northerner cultures, there are at least a handful of emerging cultural strands:

- In the highlands, particularly the upper Volta, Lavnoch, and the higher foothills of the Sentinels, a culture worshipping kestavo and speaking a Northros tongue (this will become Old Zimkovan)
- On the coasts, a seafaring culture speaking an Eastros tongue, who will become the Skaer
- In between -- in the fertile river valleys of the Semb, Volta, and Teft -- a mixed culture that increasing comes to speak an Eastros tongue, but worship kestavo (these will become the lowland Zimka)
* The Tyrwinghans, somewhat isolated from the rest, with cultural and linguistic ties to the Tollish culture, but also separated from the rest of human culture by the great lizardfolk swamp

Some other cultures may be emerging here as well, those these are less established:
- A Tollish culture, centered on the ~Gulf of Tollen~ and the mouth of the Volta, perhaps that is religiously unusual or otherwise is somewhat apart the other intermixed cultures


%% Old Brainstorming:

* The Zimka, as they came to be known, spread across three distinct regions: the foothills near the headwaters of the [[Volta]] and the [[Lavnoch Plateau]]; the upper [[Semb]] valley; and the [[Volta]] river valley and the forests it passes through
* The Skaer, dedicated to the ocean, settled on their islands and dominating the sea and the immediate coasts
* The Tollish culture, a blend of the Skaer and Zimka, speaking a Eastros language but worshipping different gods than the Skaer brethern either kestavo or something kestavo like, or a pantheon that died out during the Downfall, which came to dominate the lower Semb, the lower Volta, and the Teft river valleys. Tollen itself could have been seen as Tollish, or it could be seen as Skaer, I'm not sure the distinction is really important at this ancient date
%%

Exactly what is happening Vostok at this time is unclear. 

%% Brainstorming:
At least two cultural strands: in the northern parts of Vostok, a culture with close ties to the Zimka has developed --  not clear if this is canonical  --- whereas the southern coasts are part of the Tollish and Skaerish cultures. But whether a third cultural strand has appeared in Vostok is not determined.
%%
## The Downfall
The Downfall impacts the lizardfolk and elves more than the humans. The great lizardfolk kingdoms vanish, surviving only in the small settlements in Ozobal and elsewhere along the river deltas, and the elves retreat to their isolated forest of Orenlas. Many humans die, but the basic cultures survive, as do the Tyrwinghans, who are mostly unscathed, likely due to the influence and protection of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. 

During the next three hundred or so years, the Skaer blossom and an Skaegish Empire spreads along the coasts, though exactly how this Skaer culture relates to the lowland Zimka or the Tollish culture is unclear and not determined. 

By the year 4400, as the Drankorian expansion begins in the south, there are several human cultures;

* The highland culture, an isolated northerner branch of the Zimka, preserving the kestavo traditions and speaking a Northros language, spreading across the highlands, particularly the [[Lavnoch Plateau]] and the isolated highlands north of the [[Great Chasm]]. 
* A river valley culture, worshipping kestavo and retaining cultural connections to the highland culture (e.g. through pilgrimage, maybe trade), but speaking an Eastros language
* The Skaer Empire, dominating the coast, speaking Skaegish and worshipping [[Kaikkea]]
* The Tyrwinghans, in their pocket of the world
* Possibly a separate Tollish culture around the lower Volta; though Tollen is fairly Skaer in this period that might reflect elite rule/influence over a distinct culture

Again, Vostok is unclear. This would be an opportune time for interesting things to be happening in Vostok. The coastal Vostok culture at this time is likely dominated by the Skaer.

Key points:
- The highland culture and the river valley culture are both culturally and religiously northerner, but have diverged linguistically
- The Skaer emerge as a unified culture worshipping Kaikkea and dominating the seas

## Coming of Drankor
Between 4475 and 4535 (330s - 400s, DR) Drankor rapidlly expands north, and the Istabor Valley, Cymea, and Sembara are settled by the rapidly growing Drankorian population.

In Istabor and Cymea there are few humans as these lands were once part of the great non-human empires. The Drankorian culture dominates here. North of the Mostreve Hills, however, the Drankorians encounter the diverse mixed mariner and northerner cultures here. 

The Skaer Empire largely fades away, from a combination of Drankorian pressure and internal politics, and by 4535, the cultural landscape looks like:

* The old Zimka in the northern foothills and the  [[Lavnoch Plateau]], preserving traditional ways and language
* A more modern Zimka culture, worshipping kestavo but speaking an Eastros language, settled in the river valleys but moving inland in the face of Drankorian pressure, settling largely in the Breva forests (the upper Semb / Ardlas is unclear here, maybe is a Drankorian province) 
* A central Sembaran culture, speaking Drankorian and worshipping Mos Numena, but with some lasting cultural ideas from the kestavo/Tollish/Zimka culture
* A coastal/northern Tollish culture, worshipping Mos Numena and speaking both Drankorian and Old Tollish (this becomes Telham/Tollen area)
* A southern culture, in [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] and the [[Istaros Watershed]], somewhat more purely Drankorian, and worshipping Mos Numena
* A Tyrwinghan culture, spreading into Addermarch as well, increasingly urbanizing and adopting some Drankorian ways, but with its own unique language and cultural identity

Vostok? It feels like perhaps the coastal Tollish culture is spreading into near southern Vostok here? But interior Vostok is pretty unexplored in the above.
## Fall of Drankor
For 600-700 years, Drankor rules the Sembaran Provinces in (mostly) peace, and the culture evolves during this time, especially along the borders. 

* In the north, the Zimka increasingly remain kestavan worshippers, and the "old" and "new" Zimka increasingly intermingle and reunify. The Eastros-based language comes to dominate, although some small pockets of Old Zimka remain, especially in a ritual context and in the higher elevations, and many of the kestavo have Old Zimka names. 
* In the central Sembaran provinces, the intercessionist form of Mos Numena develops and a broad Sembaran culture starts to form
* In Tyrwingha, there is much intermixing with the Sembaran culture, but a strong traditionalist attitude as well, and the Tyrwinghan language remains common in rural areas, but the Sembaran form of worship is adopted with some small Tyrwinghan flavors
* Maseau and the Isataros watershed increasingly develop a very Drankorian culture, with closer ties to Drankor itself

%% The Istabor watershed in particular is not well developed here and this should be not considered canon; the main point is that Maseau is fairly culturally distinct from the main Sembaran provinces, and is more purely Drankorian %%
## The Great War and Rise of Sembara



## The Modern Era

In the modern era (since the Great War), the Greater Sembaran region has been the home to a number of different cultural elements:

* The ~Old Zimka~, a traditionalist and declining culture limited to the higher northern foothills of the Sentinels and pockets on the [[Lavnoch Plateau]]. This culture preserves many of the ancient northern ways, worships the kestavo, and speaks a Northros language. These people have never been ruled by Drankor or Sembara
* The ~New Zimka~, a blended culture that maintains a significant shared identity with the ~Old Zimka~, but that speak a Eastros derived but Drankorian influenced language. These people were never ruled by Drankor, but have, at times, been part of the larger Sembaran Empire, although since 1650 they have been independent. Mostly worship the kestavo, although there are pockets of Mos Numena
* The Sembarans, a Drankorian derived culture but with significant influences from both Tollenders and Zimkovans. Some cultural differences between the northern Sembarans, especially in the highlands and the Duchy of Telham, and the southern Sembarans persist. The northern strands of Sembaran culture tend to be more Tollish/Zimkovan, and the southern more Drankorian/Isinguese. Speaks a Eastros/Drankorian blended language and worships Mos Numea. 
* The Tyrwinghans, an ancient culture of unclear origin, although with significant assimilation trends and a lot of Drankorian and Sembaran influences. Worships Mos Numena, and mostly speaks Sembaran, but with a significant minority that speak Tyrwinghan, an ancient language with some relationships to Eastros. The Tyrwinghan culture, broadly, also spreads west into parts of modern-day Addermarch, although the fey influence and fey culture is distinctly different. See [[Addermarch]] for more.
