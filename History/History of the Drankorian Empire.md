# History of the Drankorian Empire

%%^Campaign:none%%
This note covers the history of much of the developed area of Taelgar, from the point of view of Drankor. 

Note that I have left dm_notes and dm_owner as I have extensive additional historical notes that need to be collated from the Dunmar Campaign; much of this will likely turn into DM sections, which are absent for now.
%%^End%%

## Beginnings of Empire
_DR 1 - DR 331_

The city of Drankor was founded in the year 4133 by the Dwarven count of years, which became the first year of the Drankorian reckoning.  The early years of growth and recovery in the shadow of the destroyed forests of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]] are poorly recorded. By the end of this era, the fledging Drankorian Empire has settled and controls the entire [[Istaros Watershed]]. 

- (DR:: 1): The city of [[Drankor]] is founded by refugees from [[Hkar]] fleeing the wars of [[The Downfall]]
- (DR:: 169): Celadir is proclaimed the first Emperor of [[Drankor]], laying claim to the coastal plains and the rich Isatros river valley.

## First Age of Expansion
_DR 331 to DR 528_

While during the founding era the empire grew from its roots as a powerful city to a great river realm, during much of this time it was settling land left changed and unpopulated by the [[Downfall Wars]], land that had once been occupied largely by the elven realm of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. In the DR 330s, Drankor began to spread its influence into lands populated by other human survivors of the Downfall Wars. This era was marked by expansion and increasing diversity in the imperial population, but also by war and tragedy. %% this is left intentionally a little vague the vibe here is extraplanar evil and part of the motivation of the shift towards magical research and planar control in Drankorian society %%

- (DR::402): The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] is signed by Emperor Goristo, and establishes the Volta as the northern border of the Drankorian Empire; the people living in what is now Sembara and Cymea are imperial subjects.
- (DR:: 525) - (DR_end:: 528): The Demonfire Wars, fought against a severe abyssal incursion. Emperor Ingwelir, a renowned wizard and warrior, died at the gates of Drankor defending the city against a demon lord. 

## The Peace of Drankor
_DR 528 - 595_

A great age of peace and prosperity across the Empire. 

- (DR:: 528) - (DR_end:: 595): The Peace of Drankor, a time of peace and prosperity in the aftermath of the Demonfire Wars. Ended by the fratricide of Oros the Cruel. Later known as the First Peace or the First Golden Age. 

## The Western Wars
_DR 595 - DR 647_

During this era, the Empire turns to conquest, and fights a series of wars in the west, conquering the western coast as far as Lake Valandros. See: [[Western Wars]]. 

- (DR:: 597): The Battle of Yaroket ("Yah-roh-keht"), won by Drankor in the Myraeni Gap, begins the Western Wars and the conquest of the western coast by Drankor
- (DR:: 634): The Battle of Tawir Forest ends the Drankorian conquest of the west on the northern shores of Lake Valandros. 

## The Golden Age
_DR 647 - DR 965_

A long period of peace, and a time that recalled the early days of Drankor's glory. Many significant institutions (such what would become the [[Great Library]] of Chardon) are founded during this time, and for more than three hundred years the city of Drankor serves as the protector of all against extraplanar incursions and the evils of the world. 

- (DR:: 647): The beginning of the Great Peace, sometimes called the Golden Age of Drankor, a period of 300 years of sustained peace and prosperity across the empire.  
- (DR:: 688): The Sibyline Archives, which will eventually become the Great Library, is founded in the developing city of Chardon

## Civil War
_DR 965 - DR 997_

Corruption and darkness grew in the shadows during the Golden Age. The age of peace ended abruptly, with the assassination of the Emperor and the beginning of the Drankorian Civil War. 

- (DR:: 965): The Drankorian Civil War begins with the assassination of Emperor Helea by allies of the [[Omnis Pura]], and is won by Emperor Vestian, associated with [[Omnis Pura]]

## Dominion and Downfall
_DR 997 - DR 1059_

After the victory of [[Omnis Pura]] in the Drankorian Civil War, the Empire gradually grew darker and darker, until in the end the full might of imperial power was turned to raising [[Apollyon]] to godhood, only to see defeat at the last second from a magical plague that spread through the heartlands of the empire destroying nearly everyone it touched. 

- (DR:: 1001) - (DR_end:: 1013): The Dominion Wars, a series of attempted conquests to the east
- (DR:: 1059): The destruction of [[Drankor]] by the [[First Plague]].

%% notes
Eiphis the blind - founded University of Chardon, perhaps was overly focused on academic subjects and ignored the signs of the growing power of the Omnis Pura

generally names are either Greek or Elvish, depending on whether they are of Peronar (half-elven) or Hkaran (human) ancestry

[1/16/2023 1:18 PM] rsulfuratus
there is a long golden age of peace and prosperity from ~628 - 965 or so, basically ending with Helea's reign and the events Caulaus sort of remembers, that has 13 total emperors ending with Helea
