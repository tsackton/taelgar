The first Samraat of Dunmar, the blessed [[Bhishma]] who became a deity after her death, founded the ruling [[Aatmaji dynasty]], which ruled Dunmar for 212 years. During this time, [[Kharsan]] was the chief administrative headquarters of the realm, and the heartland of Dunmar was centered on the Khartja river valley. The greatest dangers that threatened the new kingdom came out of the swamps of [[Drankor]], a cursed land still. The Aatmaji Dynasty ended when the Samraat Aatmaji [[Dasa]], the last of the Aatmaji rulers attempted to invade [[Drankor]], and failed, disastrously, never to return.
