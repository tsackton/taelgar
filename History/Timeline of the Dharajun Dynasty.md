Tim: not sure what the status is? how much have you made up in your head?

The [[Dharajun Dynasty]] was founded by Samraat Dharajun [[Jita]], a young woman from the [[~Songara Plains~]], skilled in battle and horsemanship. Uniting the Dunmari in the aftermath of the chaos that followed Dasa's defeat, Jita moved the administrative and religious center of the country to [[Tokra]], and ushered in a century of prosperity for the Dunmari. In the last years of the Dharajun Dynasty, the [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] threat grew in the north, and extensive fortifications along the [[Stoneway]] and the [[Sone]] were constructed. The Dharajun Dynasty fell in the [[Great War]], as Dunmar faced its greatest threat.
