%% set status/check/mike - for Addermarch Session 16, I will focus on the 1359-1388 era in the notes below; what is before or after is less relevant and can remain non-canonical for longer.  %%

The Dominion of Avatus was a realm in the [[Upper Istaros]] and [[Greater Sembara]]. Founded by its mysterious ruler [[Avatus]] on the [[Aurbez Plateau]] and lower foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], at its greatest extent it spread east along the [[Andonne]] to the edges of the [[Darkwood]], and north to the [[Enst]]. Briefly, much of the [[Duchy of Wisford]] and the [[Duchy of Brovna]] was occupied by the Dominion, until [[Avatus]] was defeated by [[Derik I]] and his realm collapsed.

### Beginnings
*(1180s - 1250s)*

The exact origins of the Dominion of Avatus are unclear, and possibly lost to history. But Avatus is first mentioned in some rumors, associated with some petty lords in the northern part of the Aurbez plateau, probably around 1180s. 

By the early 1200s, rumors of the Dominion of Avatus spread off the plateau, often from lizardfolk in the Aursen Marshes fleeing east, speaking of a power growing on the plateau, conquering and letting none live on the land unless they swear allegiance. 

By the early 1220s, Avatus controls the entire plateau, and for roughly a generation, or a bit longer, consolidations his control over this territory. Rumors creep out of the plateau of dark rituals and persecution of Mos Numena, but the lowlands are not really organized at all at this point. However, some people around Isingue begin giving thought to defense, and some contacts are established between various small cities and agrarian republics. 

In the late 1240s/early 1250s, Avatus launches a war of conquest off the plateau. Picks off a few isolated minor realms of various kinds before Istabor is able to mobilize, but within a 2-3 campaigns Istabor has solidified their defenses and fights Avatus to a standstill. Avatus never even attacks Maseau in this war, I think. Note: this is likely because Istabor is loosely organized and looks like a soft target, while Maseau has a powerful feudal lord with knights. 

So, by the mid 1250s you have situation below. Three powerful Sembaran (culturally, not politically) duchies in Maseau (4), Brovna (5) and Wisford (6), who Avatus has not attacked yet, form a solid northern border, while the fortified line of the Andonne and Douren forms the southern border.

The details of these wars are largely not invented and the exact timeline is not established, but rough dates are given below (not canonical). 

- (DR:: 1187): First recorded mention of Avatus (probably in service of some petty lord, or maybe in a slightly more mysterious context - the basic vibe is that Avatus' origin is mysterious but he does not spring into the world as ruler of a realm)
- (DR:: 1201): First mention of Lord Avatus, with some vibe that he is ruling a small territory in northwestern Aurbez (the basic vibe again is that Avatus establishes a remote power base as his first act, but does not immediately leap into conquest). 
- (DR:: 1209) - (DR_end:: 1211): ~Dominion War~. Over two summers of campaigning, Avatus pushes east and south, conquering to the eastern edge of the plateau, stopping at the edges of the Aursen Marshes (at this stage, controls 1 + 2 on the map above, and some creepy vibes are becoming apparent - probably rumors start to grow of some kind of dark rites in Avatus' territory, and movement is heavily restricted). At the end of this war, Avatus proclaims the Dominion of Avatus. 
- (DR:: 1211) - (DR_end:: 1217): ~Aursen Raids~. Over a period of years, tensions run hot along the Aursen. Frequent raids attack lizardfolk villages, perhaps often led by hobgoblins; monster attacks become common. Lizardfolk start fleeing east, mostly settling along the lower Aursen but also trickling into Isingue and the upper Istaros. 
- (DR:: 1217) - (DR_end:: 1222): ~Aursen Marsh War~. Over a period of 5 years, Avatus conquerors the Aursen Marshes and the lower slopes of the Sentinels, but does not attempt to challenge Stoneborn dominance of the high passes. Many lizardfolk flee east during this time and the Aursen Marshes are essentially entirely depopulated. No one knows the fate of lizardfolk who could not escape - news does not get out. 
- (DR:: 1222) - (DR_end:: 1246): Consolidation. Avatus consolidates his gains, perhaps beginning to make overtures to some of the lowland petty lords along the Andonne. Perhaps styles himself the Emperor of New Drankor during this period, but not in an expansionist way, rather as a claim to legitimacy and a strategy to get petty lords with no heirs in the Andonne valley to make him heir to their thrones or something. During this period, there are likely a few brief skirmishes with Ardith mining colonies, which respond by sealing doors and abandoning any surface settlements. This is also likely when hobgoblin court wizards become established. 
- (DR::1246) - (DR_end:: 1255): ~Andonne War~. Nearly a decade of war with Isingue / Istabor to the south; this is the triggering event that creates the Istabor Alliance in the Istaros valley. Ends with establishment of a defensive line aided by magic on both sides along the Andonne and Douren. 

As this era ends, the Dominion of Avatus has grown into a powerful, isolated kingdom, from which many strange rumors emanate, and which functionally cuts the growing Sembaran duchies of Maseau, Brovna, and Wisford off from Isingue / Istaros (although it is likely that prior of Avatus, this was kind of a no-man's land anyway, with bandits and other worse dangers). The northern and eastern borders are pretty loose, and Avatus probably acts meek before the Sembaran trio, maybe even attempting a bit of an alliance against minor petty kings and bandits in area 7. The southern border is heavily fortified along the lines of the river. 
### Watchful Peace
*(1250s - 1350s)*

This is a time of contrasts. Along the southern border on the Andonne and Douren, long stretches of heavy fortifications, maintained by magic on both sides, lead to a tense stalemate. Ancient Drankorian bridges are destroyed; the Heartroot grows walls of thorns and traps for boats; the Isinguer strand of the Rangers begin to develop. But behind the fortifications, Istabor prospers, a fertile and rich agricultural land both exporting to Cymea and Dunmar, and facilitating extensive trade flowing from Cymea <-> Dunmar <-> West Coast. Little news escapes the Dominion of Avatus, but there is also little evidence of danger, and neither side attempts to push across the river. The very defensives that keep Avatus out also make it quite difficult for refugees to escape into Istabor. 

In the north, the bulk of the population of Maseau is along the west, and population drops off to the east; between Maseau and Westcliff is a small unamed duchy ruled by a succession of bandit kings, sometimes at peace, sometimes at war. 

Avatus is unnerving, and plenty of rumors about suppression of Mos Numena escape. There is probably a lot of internal debate in Maseau at this time, and some castles are built, but fundamentally Maseau is (a) fairly strong and confident, and (b) not interested in wars of aggression and believes the Dominion to be content with its borders. 

A few notes in this era:
- Avatus is likely building internal political structures at this point, and this may be a major focus of the hobgoblin wizards and magic item development - this likely distracts Atavus' focus. 
- Avatus and Istabor are both deeply entrenched, and neither can prosecute a cross-river attack without catastrophic losses. 
- Some factions in Maseau argue “build more castles, this thing is bad news,” while others argue “he hasn’t attacked us in a century, don’t provoke him.” Ultimately the cautious, "he seems happy with his borders" wins, but this is probably locally unpopular in some places (among priests of Mos Numena, especially). 
### The Fifty Years' War
*(1350s - 1405ish)*

In the 1350s, Avatus exhausted the easy supplies of serpentine, which was crucial in some way to (something something, probably never really clear outside his realm). This leads to a series of conflicts between Avatus and his northern neighbors, primarily Maseau, unnamed minor duchy, and Addermarch. 

- (DR:: 1353) - (DR_end:: 1357): ~First Serpentine War~. Avatus first uses as a pretext raids from unnaed minor duchy to launch an attack north, along the narrow strip of land (7 in map above), capturing some minor serpentine deposits on the western edges of the Westcliff. Maseau is convinced to remain officially neutral (though some probably push to take the opportunity to attack Avatus) - though Avatus is deeply creepy in >100 years has never attacked Maseau, while minor unnamed duchy has. Notably, Avatus probably sells the fiction, promoting the war officially as stabilizing the gap / punishing raiders for everyone's benefit. 
- (DR:: 1357) - (DR_end:: 1359): Avatus has no interest in Vaubonne (maybe it doesn't have deposits of serpentine), but is deeply interested in the rest of Westcliff and in the southern/western mountains in Maseau. Establishes a vassal / client state between his Dominion and Vaubonne as a buffer (in northern part of 7 on the map). Sends increasingly strident demands to negotiate mineral deals to both Addermarch and Maseau. Initially, Maseau agrees, signing a treaty in which they will ship X amount of serpentine to Avatus, in exchange for Y silver or something (this is surface-level fair but Maseau likely doesn't know true value of serpentine; Avatus perhaps also later twists this, starts ramping up demands, etc). Addermarch refuses.
- (DR:: 1359) - (DR_end:: 1362): ~First Addermarch War~. Avatus attacks Addermarch, in a series of brutal campaigns where serpentine berserkers appear on the battlefield. Maseau gets scared and begins planning to violate treaty. Addermarch holds on, but barely. 
- (DR:: 1362) - (DR_end:: 1363), winter: Brutal, cold winter and late spring causes widespread famine, interrupting the summer campaigning season (or something else, vibe is basically things suck but Avatus takes a break)
- (DR:: 1363): Maseau refuses to deliver serpentine per treaty. 
- (DR:: 1364) - (DR_end:: 1377): ~Second Serpentine War~. Avatus unleashes hobgoblins for the first time, fighting a two front war to defeat Maseau and Addermarch. This proceeds in fits and starts with some years consumed by stalemate and local skirmishing. By the end of the war, Maseau has been forced to capitulate and now must pay tribute in serpentine, destroy fortifications, and other things; many lords are forced into exile in Brovna and Wisford. Addermarch refuses to surrender, and most of west Addermarch is occupied. 
- (DR:: 1377) - (DR_end:: 1385): Proto-Rangers in Addermarch begin campaign of guerilla harassment against Atavus forces. During this time, Avatus brings word of Cha'mutte's rise to Wisford and Brovna, pitching them on an my enemy of my enemy is my friend alliance, assuring them the troubles in Maseau and Addermarch are just mundane squabbles over broken treaties and the like. Of course people are suspicious, but treaties are signed, etc, even while the Addermarch guerilla campaign continues apace. 
- (DR:: 1385) - (DR_end:: 1388): ~Second Addermarch War~. Addermarch rises up and throws off Atavus. 
- (DR:: 1388) - (DR_end:: 1400): Growing discontent among exiled barons of Maseau, and inspiration from Addermarch. Plots hatched by especially the sons of exiled Maseau lords to take their territory back. 
- (DR:: 1400) - (DR_end:: 1403): ~Maseau War~. Exiled Maseau lords attack from the north, in coordination with local uprisings, and are badly beaten by Atavus. Maseau nobility executed and hobgoblin lords installed in their place. Atavus formally annexes the mineral rich parts of Maseau (south and west), and leaves a rump client state in place as a buffer to the north. 

This period ends with Atavus in control of two vassal states in the north (rump Duchy of Maseau) and the vassal state established in late 1350s. 

### The Uneasy Peace
*(1403 - 1420ish)*

For a little under 20 years, there is an uneasy peace, but this is not sustainable. Brovna and Wisford no longer see Avatus as a viable ally against anyone, and in any case there is no evidence of the shadow dragon Cha'mutte that Avatus convinced them to be scared of. And the rumors that trickle out from Maseau and the other vassal state are increasingly brutal - Mos Numena suppressed, heavy taxation, hobgoblin lords, and those who can't pay forced to work in bondage in mines. Avatus cannot stop news from trickling out, and so despite official postures both sides creep towards war. 

### Sembaran Wars
*(1420s - 1430)*

Avatus strikes first and conquers Brovna, executing the nobility; shortly after Wisford attacks, but is caught out. Avatus makes quick progress across the Enst, driving Wisford armies towards the Wistel until Derik I unites the Sembaran crown and comes to the rescue. Avatus is destroyed and his dominion collapses.
