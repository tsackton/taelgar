The Dominion of Avatus was a realm in the [[Upper Istaros]] and [[Greater Sembara]]. Founded by its mysterious ruler [[Avatus]] on the [[Aurbez Plateau]] and lower foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], at its greatest extent it spread east along the [[Andonne]] to the edges of the [[Darkwood]], and north to the [[Enst]]. Briefly, much of the [[Duchy of Wisford]] and the [[Duchy of Brovna]] was occupied by the Dominion, until [[Avatus]] was defeated by [[Derik I]] and his realm collapsed.

Mike - this is a slight tweak to the Discord timeline but I think works

### Beginnings

The exact origin of Avatus and the Dominion of Avatus is unclear (and possibly lost to history), but Avatus  probably first started gathering allies (hobgoblins and others, possibly some remnants of Drankor, details are unclear) in the late 1100s or early 1200s. In the beginning, the Dominion is in the foothills of the Sentinels, around the southern end of the [[Aurbez Plateau]]. Whether this was unsettled land, or Avatus conquered/killed those who lived there is not known, though at least some lizardfolk who later became established along the Istaros and its tributaries probably fled from the Aursen Marshes bringing the first hints of Avatus to Isingue. 

In the DR 1230s, Avatus launches a war, sweeping down from the plateau along the Andonne. The Istabor Alliance rapidly forms to counter the threat, and while much of the lands north of the Andonne are lost, the Istabor Alliance fortifies the borders along the Andonne and Douren. 

Note: this war is probably largely NOT fought by hobgoblins - at this point, Avatus is likely styling himself the Emperor of New Drankor.

### The Watchful Peace

For ~70 years, there is peace, more or less, perhaps broken by a few minor skirmishes / wars that don't result in border changes. The Istabor border is heavily fortified, as is Masseau. 

Ideas:
- During this time the Isinguer strand of the Rangers perhaps develops; the Andonne is protected in part by the magic of the Heartroot - maybe the proto-Rangers grow fortifications out of trees or something. Also a good place for English longbowmen vibes. The basic idea is that the interior of Isingue prospers and feels safe during this time, and the defensive line along the Andonne is never seriously threatened. 
- Masseau doesn't have the Heartroot but is heavily foritifed
- Perhaps there is another, more marginal Duchy east of Masseau, up against Westcliff and stretching towards Vaubonne (which presumably exists in this era but not clear who it swears allegiance to, if anyone)

### "Addermarch" Wars

(not just Addermarch of course - will need a name)

This ends around ~DR 1320, when Avatus moves north in a series of wars. Likely this is something like three wars: first, the conquest of the eastern marginal duchy or eastern Masseau, depending on context. This gives Avatus control of the Gap of Masseau and puts him in striking distance of the Massaeu interior to the west, as well as Addermarch to the east (though terrain is more difficult here). Some period of peace after this, but marked by frequent border raids. Then a two front war into Masseau and Addermarch. A big chunk of southern Masseau is conquerored, as are parts of western Addermarch. Masseau makes peace, with the north basically like Vichy France. Addermarch is outmatched and agrees to a truce with some parts of western Addermarch in Avatus' control. Then, a few years later (maybe 10), Addermarch launches another war to drive Avatus off its territory. 

### Stability

By 1370 or so, then, you have Avatus in control of a large swatch of the Duchy of Masseau, along with Aurbez and the modern-day March of Andonne. To the north, you have a client state in the rump of the Duchy of Masseau, possibly a peace treaty of some kind with Wisford, and then something about the Barony of Vaubonne. Wisford, for whatever reason (complacency, troubles elsewhere, etc) does not fortify the Enst at this time. 

The Westcliff is heavily fortified, and Addermarch and Avatus take turns raiding into each other's territory, but this is generally pretty low key and never really breaks out into a hot war. To the south, the border with Istabor is stable and continues to be heavily defended. 

### "Sembaran" Wars

This ends around 1410-1420, when Avatus (for some undetermined reason, perhaps having to do with Cha'mutte) moves north across the Enst, in a much more brutal campaign. Leads with hobgoblins, let's them rule conquered territory. Conquers Brovna, and then attacks Wisford. Ends with the defeat of Avatus himself and the collapse of his realm in battle against Derik I.
