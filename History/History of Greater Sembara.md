%%^Campaign:None%%
This covers the history of modern day [[Sembara]], [[Zimkova]], [[Addermarch]], [[Tyrwingha]], and [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], although recent events in [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] may be better covered elsewhere when a history of the [[Upper Istaros]] is more developed.

Some adjacent areas have significant intertwined history: [[Tollen]] (see [[History of Tollen]]), and [[Dominion of Avatus]] in particular, but also the [[Skaer]] (see [[History of the Skaer]]). [[Vostok]] has minimal development but likely is more related to the [[Skaer]] and [[Tollen]] than Sembara.

## Migration Era
_Until the Downfall_

The first humans to come to Greater Sembara were northerners, speaking a Northros language and traveling from the west over the Sentinels. They were later joined by the mariners, traveling from the east through the Green Sea, speaking an Eastros languages, and the Tyrwinghans, who do not record their lineage. When the humans came to the region, it was dominated by several large non-human civilizations: dwarves in the Sentinels, lizardfolk in a great swamp that stretched across the Wistel and Enst river valleys and beyond, and the elven forests to the south of what is now the Mostreve Hills.

## Post Downfall
_The Downfall - DR 300s_

## Coming of Drankor
_DR 300s - 400s_
%% Status: @Tim to check %%

By the reign of Emperor [[Anates]] the burgeoning Drankorian civilization has spread northward and crossed the Mostreve Gap into the Sembaran river valleys and starts to encounter the Zimka, Tollish, and Skaer cultures. Although some sources might describe this as a conquest, in reality Drankorian rule was largely welcomed as a source of order and protection. The Drankorian expansion ends in the north on the banks of the [[Volta]], when the Skaer and Drankorians sign the [[Treaty of Marhavn]]. The expansion into [[Zimkova]] is more fitful, and modern sources do not record whether the Drankorians were welcomed, resisted, or both. 

%%^Campaign:None%%
#### Basic Vibes
In general, the idea is that over 30 - 100 years (probably closer to the low end),  the Drankorian armies occupy large portions of this land.  However, this is largely not a military conquest, although some wars or battles are possible. In many cases this may involve Sembarans willing or even eagerly joining the Drankorian Empire; the existence of the two treaties below is canonical but they are not necessarily the result of war. The Skaer may also have had a different perspective, and some worldbuilding suggests that most of the tensions were between the Skaer and Drankor.
#### Canonical Events
* (DR:: 402): The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] is signed by Emperor [[Goristo]] 
* (DR:: 423): Emperor [[Goristo]] signs the [[Treaty of Tyrwingha]] with [[Archfey Ethlenn|Ethlenn]]
#### Context at the End of the Period
At the end of this period, the Drankorian provinces stretch from the Sentinels to the Green Sea, and cover the modern areas of: [[Sembara]], [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], [[Addermarch]], [[Tyrwingha]], and [[Ardlas]]. The Skaer Empire has largely faded away (but see [[Timeline of Skaer History]]), and there are several human cultures within and outside the Drankorian Empire:

* The old Zimka in the north
* A culture increasingly claiming to be the Zimka, opposed to Drankor (or at least, not part of Drankor), in the highlands and foothills of the Sentinels. This culture develops into the "Zimkovan kingdoms" of [[Breva]], [[Lavnoch Plateau|Lavnoch]]
* A central Sembaran culture, speaking Drankorian and worshipping Mos Numena, but with some lasting cultural ideas from the kestavo/Tollish/Zimka culture
* A coastal/northern Tollish culture, worshipping Mos Numena and speaking both Drankorian and Old Tollish (this becomes Telham/Tollen area)
* A southern culture, in [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] and the [[Istaros Watershed]], somewhat more purely Drankorian, and worshipping Mos Numena
* A Tyrwinghan culture, spreading somewhat into Addermarch as well, increasingly urbanizing and adopting some Drankorian ways, but with its own unique language and cultural identity
#### Non-Canonical Events 
* ((DR:: 358)): Emperor [[Anates]] campaigns around the [[Mostreve Hills]] %% Anates is canonically the first emperor to establish a Drankorian presence in Sembara but exact timing is not canonical %%
* (DR:: 360): Emperor [[Anates]] crosses the [[Enst]] and establishes a garrison at [[Cleenseau]] %% Drankor definitely established a garrison, but it is long since ruined and this date could move substantially if needed %%
%%^End%%
## Age of Drankor
_DR 400s - DR 1059_

## Dark Ages
_DR 1059 - DR 1353

In DR 1059, the [[First Plague]] came and the Drankorian Empire collapsed. Little information survives from these years, and it was a time of much hardship, especially amongst the more populous lowland regions, where famine struck repeatedly. 

%%^Campaign:None%%
#### Basic Vibes
This is meant to be a period of collapse, reset, and depopulation. There is very little historically developed about this period and it should continue to provide a blank space for rumors and unclear mythological events. In general during this period the Sembaran region should seem isolated and like a backwater. There are lots of potentially interesting events in Cymea, Isingue, etc and these probably did not have much impact on Sembara or Maseau or even Addermarch.
#### Canonical Events

#### Context at the End of the Period
At the end of this period, a couple of things are definitely true:
* The [[Duchy of Sembara]] is prominent and the Duke has taken a title of King/Queen, although of what exactly is not clear, but presumably it has to be more than just the single duchy
* [[Embry]] is a major city
* A number of other duchies are canonically independent and powerful in their own right: [[Wisford]], [[Marches of Brovna|Brovna]], [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], [[Ardlas]], and [[Telham]] in particular
* [[Addermarch]] and [[Tyrwingha]] have developed in unique ways

## The Peace of Cece
_DR 1650 - DR 1713_

%% Status: @Tim to check %%

In the autumn of 1650, after three summers of campaigning, the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] has been cleansed from the land. Three years prior, a hobgoblin dominion stretched in the Enst valley, from the [[Sentinel Range]] to the headwaters of the Aure in Addermarch, and even northwards into the [[Barony of Vaubonne]]. It is now gone, although people have only slowly started returning to the war-torn lands.

The reign of [[Cece I]] is a time of peace and prosperity. The borders are secure, trade is growing, and Sembara's relations with its neighbors are friendly, and the hobgoblin threat, although not entirely gone, is isolated to [[Western Marches|the Western Marches]].
