# History of Tollen

%% this note covers the history of the [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]], occasionally touching on larger events but mostly focused specifically on the city %%

This is a chronicle of the history of the [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]], from its founding to the present day. Tollenders are deeply proud of their long history, and many will claim that Tollen is the oldest continually occupied [[Humans|human]] city in the world. Whether true or not is hard to know, but regardless Tollen's history stretches deep into the past.

## Founding Era
*before the Downfall*

Tollen was originally settled on the north bank of the [[Volta]] long ago, when the elves still ruled vast forests far to the south, and great lizardfolk swamps occupied the land that is now [[Sembara]]. The [[Skaer]] say that the first Tollenders were their distant ancestors, a mariner people who came from [[Hkar]] on great ships and slowly explored and settled the shores of the [[Green Sea]], but it is clear that even from the beginning Tollen was a place where many cultures met and intermingled. This era lasted until the [[The Downfall|Downfall]] and the sinking of [[Hkar]] upended the world, reaching even as far away as the [[Green Sea]].

### DM Notes
#### Basic Vibes

Tollen is supposed to have (a) an ancient history, and (b) a long history of multiculturalism. It is certainly founded by the Skaer or proto-Skaer, but is presumably also a place where lizardfolk come, halfling traders dock, and multiple human cultures -- including the mariners, proto-Skaer, and northerners -- mix. Old Tollish presumably develops here out of an Eastros / mariner root (cf. [[Languages#Eastros Language Family]]). Multiple religions canonically even early on though the exact details of the mariner religion and how it develops into the Skaer religion are not invented. There is a suggestion in the [[History of the Skaer]] that the original Skaer were eastern mariners fleeing a religious schism and trying to find a quiet place to live in peace. 

It is not clear if any existing parts of Tollen survive from this era, or whether everything was rebuilt after the Downfall. It is possible, though not certain, that the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]] dates to this era. 

Generally, the Founding Era should mostly function as part of the myth of Tollen to the Tollish.

## The Skaer Empire
*Downfall - DR 402*

In the aftermath of the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the seas shifted, the ocean turned violent, and the land dried up, the great swamps of the lizardfolk south of Tollen shrinking to small remnants. Many people die in storms and famine. During this time, the [[Skaer]] emerge from the ancient [[~Mariners~|seafarers]] who originally settled Tollen, and become the dominant people of the [[Western Green Sea]], worshipping the ocean goddess [[Kaikkea]]. Tollen becomes a major port and trade center under [[Skaer]] rule. However, to the south, the influence of the [[Drankorian Empire]] is growing, and this era ends when the [[Skaer]] sign the [[Treaty of Marhavn]] with [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]. 

Most people believe that the oldest parts of Tollen -- [[Fiskurth]], [[Skepwalk]], and [[Aesganstrad]] -- were settled during this era. 

- (DR:: 402): The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] is signed between Emperor [[Goristo]] and the [[Skaer]], marking the end of the Skaer Empire in Tollen and the beginning of the Age of Drankor

### DM Notes
#### Basic Vibes

The Skaer become a dominant maritime force in the pre-Drankorian western Green Sea (cf. [[History of the Skaer]]), and Tollen is a significant part of their empire, but almost no details are invented about this time. It is possible that Tollen is nearly completely destroyed early in this period, or during the Downfall Wars, and rebuilt by the Skaer, or it is possible that a significant settlement survives the Downfall. 

There is a possibility the Skaer are a raiding culture at this time, e.g. spreading along the coast as far south as the mouth of the [[Semb]], raiding upriver for timber and impressed sailors to row their great ships, and seeking converts for their religion. But this is not canonical and might be wrong; details of the Skaer empire at this time should be developed in [[History of the Skaer]]. 

This period ends with the Treaty of Marhavn, which ends Skaer military dominance, though not necessarily cultural influence, in Tollen. The reason for the treaty and what it contains is not invented. While the exact details of the [[Treaty of Marhavn]] are not canonical, this represents a major shift in Tollen. Any invention around the treaty and its context needs to explain how Tollen becomes effectively a Drankorian protectorate. 

#### Influence on Modern Tollen

During the height of the Skaer empire, Tollen was a small city, surrounded by an embankment and a wooden wall, set on the north side of the [[Volta]]. It mainly functioned as a port for timber and other goods leaving the [[Volta]] watershed. Three modern wards have names that reflect a Skaer heritage:

- [[Skepwalk]]: North side of the [[Volta]], easternmost (oceanside) district. Excellent harbor area, where a curve in the river creates a wide, deep anchorage. Name derives from old Eastros word for docks; this is the westernmost ward on the north side of the river, and among the oldest docks and shipyards in the city. 
- [[Fiskurth]]: North side of the [[Volta]], northwest of [[Skepwalk]]. Name derives from old Eastros for fish, one of the oldest districts in the city, although little is preserved of that time. 
- [[Aesganstrad]]: North and west along the river from [[Fiskurth]]; with [[Fiskurth]] and [[Skepwalk]] forms the ancient core of the pre-Drankorian city. Name derives from Aesgan, a semi-mythical Skaegish hero who is said to have protected/resettled Tollen during the chaos after [[The Downfall]]. Best preserved of the ancient districts. Who or what Aesgan was is not canonical, but their existence in some form, at least in myth, is canonical. E.g. Aesgan could have been an elf or a dragon and later became associated with the Skaer, but should have a real existence of some kind. 

#### Context at the End of the Period

After 402, Tollen increasingly comes under Drankorian influence, and is effectively a protectorate of Drankor. Although not administered by a Drankorian governor, Tollen retains no navy and Skaer warships are forbidden from the Volta, leaving Tollen reliant on Drankor for protection. 

%%^End%%

## Age of Drankor
_DR 402 - DR 1059_

The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] establishes the [[Volta]] as the northern border of the [[Drankorian Empire]]. Though [[Tollen]], on the north bank, is not under Drankorian governence, [[Skaer]] warships are forbidden to sail the [[Volta]], leaving [[Tollen]] deeply reliant on the [[Drankorian Empire]] for protection. In practice, it becomes a Drankorian protectorate during the early part of the Age of Drankor. Throughout this period, though, Tollen retains its place as a cultural mixing ground, where many languages can be heard, and temples to the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] coexist with those dedicated to [[Kaikkea]]. %%There are presumably also followers of Kestavan traditions here as well, but not clear that they would build temples or if there are/were Kestavo shrines in Tollen.%%  The [[Skaer]], though they diminish in power and influence, retain control over the [[Temple of Kaikkea]] and continue to maintain an important presence in the city. 

This is a time of significant expansion for the city. The [[Tollen Bridge]] is constructed during this era by the Drankorians, as are the first stone walls of the city. [[Nordgate]], established around the original north gate of the city; [[Bridgeward]] and [[Southbridge]], on the north and south sides of the Tollen Bridge; and [[Magus Street]], east of the older Skaer districts and away from the river, all date to this era. Bridgeward was a major commercial district during this era, and retains some of that character today, while Southbridge and Nordgate retain little of their ancient character. %%Unclear about Magus Street; depends a lot on when University of Tollen is founded, which is TBD%%

The Age of Drankor in Tollen ends when Drankor falls to the [[First Plague]] in DR 1059.

### DM Notes
#### Basic Vibes
Very little is established canonically, though the clear vibe is that during the Age of Drankor Tollen shifts from being fundamentally a small part of a larger Skaer culture to being its own unique thing. Presumably during this time people start calling themselves Tollenders; Old Tollish begins to diverge from Skaer and drift towards modern Tollish as it picks up many words from Drankorian. This requires the Skaer to largely depart for various reasons, or at least for Skaer outmigration to outpace inmigration; the details of this should be developed in the [[History of the Skaer]], but it is important to the vibe of Tollen that, for whatever reason, the Skaer do not persist in trying to dominant Tollen politics and culture. 

The existence of an ancient temple to [[Kaikkea]], the [[Temple of Kaikkea]], is canon, and Skaer continue to maintain a presence there continually, still ongoing in DR 1749 when the Dunmari Fellowship visited Tollen. 

The existence of a Drankorian fort on the [[Little River]], which is eventually incorporated into the city as part of the [[Haurhill]] ward, is canonical. 

#### Not Canon, But Plausible

Between DR 650 and DR 900, the first merchant houses are established, becoming rich off the trade of dyed cloth south to [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], and the development of magical tattoos, especially those that could help sailors control the wind and sea. This may also be a period when Tollen starts becoming a tentative mercantile power. It is unclear when the University of Tollen is founded, but this period is a possibility. 

#### Context at the End of the Period

Tollen has become an important city, and is well positioned to grow in influence because (a) it is not governed by a Drankorian governor and thus less impacted by Apollyon's mind magic, and (b) it is quite distant from the core of the Empire where the most chaos is. However, it has not had a shipbuilding industry or navy during the entire Age of Drankor, so it is not well-defended. 

%%^End%%

## The Free City
_DR 1059 - DR 1695_

Tollen first came to prominence as a small part of the Skaer empire, and grew as a city under the shadow of the Drankorian Empire. After the Fall of Drankor, it truly became a free city. Though little is recorded from the years immediately after the Fall of Drankor, by the time modern Sembara is established under [[Derik I]], Tollen is a significant regional power, and during the [[Great War]], Tollen is an ally to [[Derik III]]. After the Great War, with the decline of [[Cymea]] as a maritime power, Tollen's navy grows in strength and the city begins to project strength throughout the [[Western Gulf]] and the [[Straits of Cymea]]. 

During this long history, Tollen expanded in several waves. As the city grows, the walls are expanded to the north and west, incorporating [[Godshome]] and [[Guildgate]] into the city. In the years before the Great War, the walls are expanded again, and [[Fat Brook]] is covered; the western part of [[Guildgate]] is enclosed in the walls at this point, as are the districts of [[Fairgate Inner]] (then simply Fairgate) and [[Haurhill]], encompassing the hill where an old Drankorian fort once stood on the height of land above the [[Little River]]. In this period, the [[Battery]] ward, on the south bank of the Volta, is constructed to strengthen the defense the city. Some time after the Great War, the walls are expanded once more, to encompass [[Brooklawn Inner]] and [[Riversgate Inner]], and the [[Little River]] is partially covered.

### The Fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the Growth of [[Sembara]]

When the Plague strikes, while Tollen is spared the worst of the chaos that envelopes the south, but plenty of chaos remains, and various wars and conflicts spiral out of control. While the university survives, and the city itself, most of its wealth is lost as trade is disrupted, and Tollen falls into a dark age. Little is recorded from the time between the Plague in 5192, and the late 5300s, when the Sembaran kings begin to grow in power.

As [[Sembara]] expands in the south, Tollen recovers, and over the 5400s and 5500s Tollen experiences a renaissance of sorts, based on the growing wool and linen trade from the Sembaran heartlands. The lost art of magical tattoos are rediscovered and most of the merchant houses of Tollen today are established during this time period.

In the 5600s, war comes to the [[Green Sea]], first the battles against the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and then the [[Great War]] itself. Tollen, however, survives intact, and if anything grows in power and influence, as many of the Sembaran kings in the years after the [[Great War]] have ties by blood or marriage to the great houses of Tollen.

Now, in 5881, Tollen commands a significant navy and is the undisputed master of the Western Gulf, controlling the [[Straits of Cymea]] and asserting influence over much of western [[Cymea]].


### The Sembaran City

After the fall of the [[Drankorian Empire]], there was a major economic disruption in the [[Green Sea]], and Tollen suffered. The population of the city shrunk, the University drifted apart, and many Drankorian structures fell into disrepair. However, in the 5300s and 5400s, as [[Sembara]] grows, Tollen experiences a major economic boom, rapidly growing. 

[[Godshome]]: West of [[Nordgate]], along Temple Street where many different houses of worship to different gods are found. Grew around (some kind of religious complex pre-existing outside the walls in the Drankorian days, perhaps).

[[Gold Street]]: West along the river from [[Bridgeward]]. Home to banks, and with [[Guildgate]] the heart of the growth boom experienced in pre-Great-War era. 

[[Guildgate]]: North and inland from [[Gold Street]] and [[Bridgeward]], around the Guild Gate and home to many of the city's richest and most powerful merchant guilds and families. Dotted with extensive palaces of merchant houses.

Fairgate: West of [[Guildgate]], inland from the [[Volta]]. [[Halflings|Halfling]] neighborhood, sometimes split into Fairgate Inner (inside walls) and Fairgate Outer (outside walls), as in the past hundred years or so the population has begun to spill out of the walls.

Haurhill: rise of land, name means "hill hill" in Eastros and Westros. Height of land within Tollen and site of early fortifications (a Drankorian fort sat here, guarding the lumber yards at the confluence of the [[Little River]] and the [[Volta]]).

### The Current City

Tollen escaped the [[Great War]] largely unscathed, and has continued to grow in the past 200 years, despite the ups and downs of [[Sembara]] in this time. The city walls were expanded again to the west, and the city has now begun to overflow the walls. 

Battery: south side of the [[Volta]], and on the easternmost (ocean) side of the city. Notable for the river fortifications that protect the main harbor; not densely populated, although small naval docks and barracks are here. Mostly dates to wars just before the [[Great War]], when Tollen was in alliance with [[Sembara]] against the dangers of the north. 

Fenslane: south side of the [[Volta]], upriver (west) from [[Southbridge]], along the bend in the river. Former tidal marshland reclaimed and settled mostly by dyers, tanners, and other similar artisans expanding from [[Southbridge]]. Reasonably new.

Tideswell: south side of the [[Volta]], upriver (west) from Fenslane. A marshy area that floods on the high tide, mix of poorer/slums and [[Lizardfolk]] communities.

Brooklawn: West of Haurhill, a swampy and wet area where the [[Little River]] was dammed and diverted into a canal. Also often separated into Brooklawn Inner (inside the walls) and Brooklawn Outer (outside the walls). Fairly poor, slummy area. Brooklawn Outer is where much of the leatherworking and tanning happens, so smelly. Tanner's Gate separates Brooklawn Inner and Brooklawn Outer, and Brooklawn Inner is also referred to as Tannersgate.

Riversgate: furthest west district, along the river. Also separated into Inner and Outer, with Riversgate Outer a center of timber trade coming down the [[Volta]].
