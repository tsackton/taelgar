# History of Tollen

%% 
status -> set check/mike for review; I believe that all canonical events are captured here; there is not a ton of tollish history invented outside the basic structuring of the city. i think status can be removed unless there is something that is unclear. 
%%

%% this note covers the history of the [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]], occasionally touching on larger events but mostly focused specifically on the city %%

This is a chronicle of the history of the [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]], from its founding to the present day. Tollenders are deeply proud of their long history, and many will claim that Tollen is the oldest continually occupied [[Humans|human]] city in the world. Whether true or not is hard to know, but regardless Tollen's history stretches deep into the past.

## Founding Era
*before the Downfall*

Tollen was originally settled on the north bank of the [[Volta]] long ago, when the elves still ruled vast forests far to the south, and great lizardfolk swamps occupied the land that is now [[Sembara]]. The [[Skaer]] say that the first Tollenders were their distant ancestors, a mariner people who came from [[Hkar]] on great ships and slowly explored and settled the shores of the [[Green Sea]], but it is clear that even from the beginning Tollen was a place where many cultures met and intermingled. This era lasted until the [[The Downfall|Downfall]] and the sinking of [[Hkar]] upended the world, reaching even as far away as the [[Green Sea]].

### DM Notes
#### Basic Vibes

Tollen is supposed to have (a) an ancient history, and (b) a long history of multiculturalism. It is certainly founded by the Skaer or proto-Skaer, but is presumably also a place where lizardfolk come, halfling traders dock, and multiple human cultures -- including the mariners, proto-Skaer, and northerners -- mix. Old Tollish presumably develops here out of an Eastros / mariner root (cf. [[Languages#Eastros Language Family]]). Multiple religions canonically even early on though the exact details of the mariner religion and how it develops into the Skaer religion are not invented. There is a suggestion in the [[History of the Skaer]] that the original Skaer were eastern mariners fleeing a religious schism and trying to find a quiet place to live in peace. 

It is not clear if any existing parts of Tollen survive from this era, or whether everything was rebuilt after the Downfall. It is possible, though not certain, that the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers]] dates to this era. 

Generally, the Founding Era should mostly function as part of the myth of Tollen to the Tollish. 

#### Events

- (CY:: 3902): Tollen is founded %% this is not crucial to anything in play but serves as a useful anchor for worldbuilding and should be considered fixed; this starts the founding era %%
- (CY:: 4122): The sinking of [[Hkar]] and the end of the [[Downfall Wars]] %% see: [[Canonical Events]]; this marks the end of the founding era%%

#### Ideas

A possibility: What if the earliest settlers of Tollen were explicitly the misfits and dissatisfied with the mariner culture, perhaps following [[Kaikkea]] specifically and rejecting the larger mariner pantheon, whatever it was. A bit of a Roger Williams or some of the other 'free thinker' early New England settlers vibe. 

Development into a mercantile culture: From that earliest point, Tollen gains a reputation as a free-wheeling place of stories and misfits and those who are looking for a new life. And with them comes the curious from other cultures, and it turns out the northerners and the mariners have a lot to sell each other, so then comes the merchants.

## The Skaer Empire
*Downfall - DR 402*

In the aftermath of the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the seas shifted, the ocean turned violent, and the land dried up, the great swamps of the lizardfolk south of Tollen shrinking to small remnants. Many people die in storms and famine. During this time, the [[Skaer]] emerge from the ancient [[~Mariners~|seafarers]] who originally settled Tollen, and become the dominant people of the [[Western Green Sea]], worshipping the ocean goddess [[Kaikkea]]. Tollen becomes a major port and trade center under [[Skaer]] rule. However, to the south, the influence of the [[Drankorian Empire]] is growing, and this era ends when the [[Skaer]] sign the [[Treaty of Marhavn]] with [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]. 

Most people believe that the oldest parts of Tollen -- [[Fiskurth]], [[Skepwalk]], and [[Aesganstrad]] -- were settled during this era. 

- (DR:: 402): The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] is signed between Emperor [[Goristo]] and the [[Skaer]], marking the end of the Skaer Empire in Tollen and the beginning of the Age of Drankor

%%^Campaign:none%%
### DM Notes
#### Basic Vibes

The Skaer become a dominant maritime force in the pre-Drankorian western Green Sea (cf. [[History of the Skaer]]), and Tollen is a significant part of their empire, but almost no details are invented about this time. It is possible that Tollen is nearly completely destroyed early in this period, or during the Downfall Wars, and rebuilt by the Skaer, or it is possible that a significant settlement survives the Downfall. 

There is a possibility the Skaer are a raiding culture at this time, e.g. spreading along the coast as far south as the mouth of the [[Semb]], raiding upriver for timber and impressed sailors to row their great ships, and seeking converts for their religion. But this is not canonical and might be wrong; details of the Skaer empire at this time should be developed in [[History of the Skaer]]. 

This period ends with the Treaty of Marhavn, which ends Skaer military dominance, though not necessarily cultural influence, in Tollen. The reason for the treaty and what it contains is not invented. While the exact details of the [[Treaty of Marhavn]] are not canonical, this represents a major shift in Tollen. Any invention around the treaty and its context needs to explain how Tollen becomes effectively a Drankorian protectorate. 

#### Influence on Modern Tollen

During the height of the Skaer empire, Tollen was a small city, surrounded by an embankment and a wooden wall, set on the north side of the [[Volta]]. It mainly functioned as a port for timber and other goods leaving the [[Volta]] watershed. Three modern wards have names that reflect a Skaer heritage:

- [[Skepwalk]]: North side of the [[Volta]], easternmost (oceanside) district. Excellent harbor area, where a curve in the river creates a wide, deep anchorage. Name derives from old Eastros word for docks; this is the westernmost ward on the north side of the river, and among the oldest docks and shipyards in the city. 
- [[Fiskurth]]: North side of the [[Volta]], northwest of [[Skepwalk]]. Name derives from old Eastros for fish, one of the oldest districts in the city, although little is preserved of that time. 
- [[Aesganstrad]]: North and west along the river from [[Fiskurth]]; with [[Fiskurth]] and [[Skepwalk]] forms the ancient core of the pre-Drankorian city. Name derives from Aesgan, a semi-mythical Skaegish hero who is said to have protected/resettled Tollen during the chaos after [[The Downfall]]. Best preserved of the ancient districts. Who or what Aesgan was is not canonical, but their existence in some form, at least in myth, is canonical. E.g. Aesgan could have been an elf or a dragon and later became associated with the Skaer, but should have a real existence of some kind. 

#### Context at the End of the Period

After 402, Tollen increasingly comes under Drankorian influence, and is effectively a protectorate of Drankor. Although not administered by a Drankorian governor, Tollen retains no navy and Skaer warships are forbidden from the Volta, leaving Tollen reliant on Drankor for protection. 

#### Ideas

Limits of Skaer influence: Although Tollen largely becomes a Skaer city, some ancient institutions of storytellers, knowledge seekers, and free-thinkers maintain their place in the city (need some kind of event to make this work out), and Tollen remains a place where the Skaer religion does not hold sway entirely. Tollen grows as a Skaer city and center of commerce., but many supposedly ancient institutions survive in the city, although who really knows how many are truly ancient, as opposed to institutions that invented ancient roots to gain prestige or maintain independence from the Skagen protectorate.

Role in the [[Treaty of Marhavn]]: Maybe Tollen is the architect of the treaty, and maybe there are reasons why. A storm giant foretold the end of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] if they expanded past the Voltra, and Tollen had evidence? Some kind of divine intervention, the divinities of Mos Numera insisted Tollen remain free? Maybe there is something special about the place that makes all the various gods of Taelgar keen to ensure it is never fully controlled by a single set of gods. Maybe this is some other kind of magical great power connection, either divine, or perhaps something connected to dragons or giants or elementals. 

If the Drankorians and the Skaer are at war: Perhaps it is Tollen that brokers a peace treaty, earning an uneasy freedom from both the Drankorians, who refrain from formally conqueoring the city in exchange for de facto control of its foreign policy, and from the Skaer, who are forbidden from sailing up the Voltra.


%%^End%%

## Age of Drankor
_DR 402 - DR 1059_

The [[Treaty of Marhavn]] establishes the [[Volta]] as the northern border of the [[Drankorian Empire]]. Though [[Tollen]], on the north bank, is not under Drankorian governence, [[Skaer]] warships are forbidden to sail the [[Volta]], leaving [[Tollen]] deeply reliant on the [[Drankorian Empire]] for protection. In practice, it becomes a Drankorian protectorate during the early part of the Age of Drankor. Throughout this period, though, Tollen retains its place as a cultural mixing ground, where many languages can be heard, and temples to the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] coexist with those dedicated to [[Kaikkea]]. %%There are presumably also followers of Kestavan traditions here as well, but not clear that they would build temples or if there are/were Kestavo shrines in Tollen.%%  The [[Skaer]], though they diminish in power and influence, retain control over the [[Temple of Kaikkea]] and continue to maintain an important presence in the city. 

This is a time of significant expansion for the city. The [[Tollen Bridge]] is constructed during this era by the Drankorians, as are the first stone walls of the city. [[Nordgate]], established around the original north gate of the city; [[Bridgeward]] and [[Southbridge]], on the north and south sides of the Tollen Bridge; and [[Magus Street]], east of the older Skaer districts and away from the river, all date to this era. Bridgeward was a major commercial district during this era, and retains some of that character today, while Southbridge and Nordgate retain little of their ancient character. %%Unclear about Magus Street; depends a lot on when University of Tollen is founded, which is TBD%%

The Age of Drankor in Tollen ends when Drankor falls to the [[First Plague]] in DR 1059. 

- (DR:: 1059): The Fall of Drankor and the First Plague ends the Age of Drankor in Tollen

%%^Campaign:none%%
### DM Notes
#### Basic Vibes
Very little is established canonically, though the clear vibe is that during the Age of Drankor Tollen shifts from being fundamentally a small part of a larger Skaer culture to being its own unique thing. Presumably during this time people start calling themselves Tollenders; Old Tollish begins to diverge from Skaer and drift towards modern Tollish as it picks up many words from Drankorian. This requires the Skaer to largely depart for various reasons, or at least for Skaer outmigration to outpace inmigration; the details of this should be developed in the [[History of the Skaer]], but it is important to the vibe of Tollen that, for whatever reason, the Skaer do not persist in trying to dominate Tollen politics and culture. 

Development of magical tattoos may date to this period, but does not need to. 

The existence of an ancient temple to [[Kaikkea]], the [[Temple of Kaikkea]], is canon, and Skaer continue to maintain a presence there continually, still ongoing in DR 1749 when the Dunmari Fellowship visited Tollen. 

The existence of a Drankorian fort on the [[Little River]], which is eventually incorporated into the city as part of the [[Haurhill]] ward, is canonical. 

#### Not Canon, But Plausible

Between DR 650 and DR 900, the first merchant houses are established, becoming rich off the trade of dyed cloth south to [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], and the development of magical tattoos, especially those that could help sailors control the wind and sea. This may also be a period when Tollen starts becoming a tentative mercantile power. It is unclear when the University of Tollen is founded, but this period is a possibility. 

#### Context at the End of the Period

Tollen has become an important city, and is well positioned to grow in influence because (a) it is not governed by a Drankorian governor and thus less impacted by Apollyon's mind magic, and (b) it is quite distant from the core of the Empire where the most chaos is. However, it has not had a shipbuilding industry or navy during the entire Age of Drankor, so it is not well-defended. 

%%^End%%

## The Free City
_DR 1059 - DR 1695_

Tollen first came to prominence as a small part of the Skaer empire, and grew as a city under the shadow of the Drankorian Empire. After the Fall of Drankor, it truly became a free city. Though little is recorded from the years immediately after the Fall of Drankor, by the time modern Sembara is established under [[Derik I]], Tollen is a significant regional power, and during the [[Great War]], Tollen is an ally to [[Derik III]]. After the Great War, with the decline of [[Cymea]] as a maritime power, Tollen's navy grows in strength and the city begins to project strength throughout the [[Western Gulf]] and the [[Straits of Cymea]]. 

During this long history, Tollen expanded in several waves. As the city grows, the walls are expanded to the north and west, incorporating [[Godshome]] and [[Guildgate]] into the city. In the years before the Great War, the walls are expanded again, and [[Fat Brook]] is covered; the western part of [[Guildgate]] (formerly Guildgate Outer) is enclosed in the walls at this point, as are the districts of [[Fairgate Inner]] (then simply Fairgate) and [[Haurhill]], encompassing the hill where an old Drankorian fort once stood on the height of land above the [[Little River]]. In this period, sometime near the time of the Great War, the [[Battery]] ward, on the south bank of the Volta, is constructed to strengthen the defense the city. 

The end of this period is dated to the beginning of Tollish attempts to control Western Cymea.

### DM Notes

_Note this is a long stretch of time; it is likely this period should be subdivided as more details are invented._
#### Basic Vibes
There is very little developed about Tollen during this time period. However, the key vibes are:
- The city keeps growing - it is never sacked and likely never even occupied, though there is space for some complications around this especially during the first few hundred years post-Drankor; a few possible near-misses might be useful. 
- However, until the end of this time, it is generally not a major maritime power. Before the Great War, Cymea, and to a lesser extent the Skaer, dominant the Western Gulf. That said, it probably needs to have some shipbuilding and at least a river fleet or a locally important navy, even if it is not projecting naval power out of the Gulf of Tollen. 

It is not clear exactly who has navies on the Western Gulf after the Great War; this could be Tollen, though canonically Tollen does not begin to control territory across the gulf in Cymea until 1695. The 1695 date is arbitrary, but should be considered canon in order to have a loose scaffold to build from; a date in this rough range is required for the backstory to the [[Labyrinths of the Lost]]. 

Some time after the Great War, the walls are expanded once more, to encompass [[Brooklawn Inner]] and [[Riversgate Inner]], and the [[Little River]] is partially covered, but this could plausibly have been near the beginning of the "Recent Events" period, below. 

#### Not Canon, But Plausible

It is likely that most guilds and merchant houses date to this period, though some may claim an older Drankorian origin, or even a pre-Drankorian origin. If the art of magical tattoos does not have a Drankorian origin, it originates during this period. 

Walls are likely expanded once in the 1300s, once in the 1400s, once in the early 1500s prior to the Great War, and finally sometime in the 1600s, but these are not canonical. 

#### Context at End of Period

The end of this period marks a shift from Tollen as a city-state to Tollen as a maritime power with growing "overseas" colonies in Western Cymea and possibly other places, such as the Vostok coast. 


%%^End%%

## Recent Events
_DR 1695 - current_

In recent years, Tollen has grown from an important city to the strongest naval power in the Western Gulf. The city has grown larger, with the wards of Fenslane and Tideswell, on the south bank of the Volta, becoming established in recent years. Tollen's influence has also grown, as now many settlements in [[Western Cymea]] are functionally Tollish colonies, and Tollen's navies control the [[Straits of Cymea]]. 

### DM Notes

#### Basic Vibes
The most important vibe is the shift from a local power to a regional one, and the appearance of Tollish colonies. The exact details of how this develops is not decided, and the timing is loose. However, this shift is supposed to be relatively recent (within living memory), and 1695 is consistent with the [[Key - LL#History|background]] for the [[Labyrinths of the Lost]] adventure set in [[Western Cymea]].
