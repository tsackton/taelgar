### The Exile of the Fraternity of the Empty Moon

The events surrounding the first time the Fraternity of the Empty Moon was driven from Tokra. Commander Ila, the local garrison commander responsible for the defense of Tokra in the aftermath of the [[Second Hobgoblin War]], seems to have driven the werewolves away during the DR 1610s, in the 67th-69th years of the Nayan Dynasty.

It was during this time that the [[Dunmari map of Pandemonium ruins]] was created.
