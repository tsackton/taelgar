Alcarinquë is the name for the ancient elven realm of the north, part of the vast forests that once stretched from [[Orenlas]] in the east, across the [[Istaros Watershed]], west across the [[Hara Basin]], and north through the forests of the [[Elderwood]] and [[Ainumarya]]. 

Only pockets of this ancient forest remain to this day, primarily around [[Orenlas]] and scattered parts of [[Ainumarya]].

Re: Orenlas remnant:

Orenlas is the last remaining ancient forest of the vast elven kingdom of Alcarinque, which once stretched from what is now the western coast of Dunmar to the [[Green Sea]] (South Cymea area). While many of the ancient trees have died, here still can be found pockets of forest originally called into being by the footsteps of Aldanor, the living tree. 

Intro about Stormcaller Tower:

*In younger days, when the vast forests of the elves stretched across these lands, a tower stood here, perched on a cliff. The cliff was less weathered then, its former form as a skyship of the storm giants clearer. Then, the winds brought news from across the vast kingdom of Alcarinquë, and for those who cared to hear it, even tidings of the humans on the distant island of Hkar. 

General:
- vibe is like [[Elderwood]] or [[Orenlas]] but bigger, more magical
- the big tree in Tokra is a remnant (not well documented)

Other than vibes, not really developed.
