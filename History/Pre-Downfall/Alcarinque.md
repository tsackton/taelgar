Alcarinquë is the name for the ancient elven realm of the north, part of the vast forests that once stretched from [[Orenlas]] in the east, across the [[Istaros Watershed]], west across the [[Dunmari Basin]], and north through the forests of the [[Elderwood]] and [[Ainumarya]]. 

Only pockets of this ancient forest remain to this day, primarily around [[Orenlas]] and scattered parts of [[Ainumarya]].
