This page categorizes known-to-exist extra-planar languages, and includes some notes on the details. See [[Languages]] for more general coverage of this topic, including background, open questions, etc.

Note: Any language that is often learned by PCs should be moved to the main [[Languages]] page once canonical details have been established and linked from here.

   * **Sylvan:** Fully canonical. (See [[Languages#Sylvan]])
   * **Primordial:** The four related languages of the elemental planes (**Aquan**, **Auran**, **Terran**, **Ignan** for the planes of water, air, earth, and fire respectively). Canonical, although unclear if there are only four dialects, or may possibly be more. (See [[Languages#Primordial]])
   * **Abyssal:**  The language of the chaotic demons of the Abyss. Canonically exists but details ill-defined.
   * **Infernal:** The language of devils and others native to the Nine Hells. Canonically exists but details ill-defined.
   * **Celestial:** The language of the divine and all the creatures native to the Divine Realms. Typically learned most easily by those with divine magic as it is related to the divine words that bring prayers to the gods and create miracles. Canonically exists, but details are ill-defined and specifics may not be canonical. 

%%^Campaign:none%%

Whether all planes have their own language, or not, is ill-defined and not canonically established. One possibly hint though is that in the Dunmar Frontier campaign, the tanshi Yezali learned a language associated with Cha'mutte's shadow dimensions, and then taught it to Delwath as they bonded. In game, Delwath never used it except to communicate with Yezali, so no canonical details exist. Cha'mutte's magic was associated with Limbo, so this unnamed language could have been the language of Limbo. When the Dunmar Fellowship was traveling in Limbo, Delwath had already gained the ability to read all languages, so his ability to read writing in Limbo does not necessarily mean that the language he learned from Yezali is the language of Limbo. But it could be. 

An alternative that can't be ruled out is that this language was simply something created in the mind of Yezali, while Yezali was lost in the shadow realm without a sense of his identity as a tanshi. 

The exact details are left as a mystery, for now.
