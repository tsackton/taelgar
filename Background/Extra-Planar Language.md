%% adding a suggestion around Shadowkar %%

This page categorizes known-to-exist extra-planar languages, and includes some notes on the details. See [[Languages]] for more general coverage of this topic, including background, open questions, etc.

Note: Any language that is often learned by PCs should be moved to the main [[Languages]] page once canonical details have been established and linked from here.

   * **Sylvan:** Fully canonical. (See [[Languages#Sylvan]])
   * **Primordial:** The four related languages of the elemental planes (**Aquan**, **Auran**, **Terran**, **Ignan** for the planes of water, air, earth, and fire respectively). Canonical, although unclear if there are only four dialects, or may possibly be more. (See [[Languages#Primordial]])
   * **Shadowkar:** The language of the [[Shadowfolds]]. Unclear canonical details, although Delwath speaks it. Might be related to undead in some fashion.

%% canonically, Shadowkar is the language that [[Yezali]] somehow learned while trapped in Cha'mutte's shadow dimension, and then taught to Delwath as they bonded. In an early conception of the Shadowfell in Taelgar, Cha'mutte's extradimensional spaces were conceived of as Shadowfell domains, but whether this still makes sense is unclear and this detail was never introduced in game. 

From Mike: Suggestion - remove Shadowkar as a language entirely, on the idea that there is no one common "Shadowfolds" and therefore no particular language of the Shadowfolds. Instead, retcon the language that Delwath and Yezali learned to be the language of Limbo. Delwath never actually did use Shadowkar in the campaign.

   * **Abyssal:**  The language of the chaotic demons of the Abyss. Canonically exists but details ill-defined.
   * **Infernal:** The language of devils and others native to the Nine Hells. Canonically exists but details ill-defined.
   * **Celestial:** The language of the divine and all the creatures native to the Divine Realms. Typically learned most easily by those with divine magic as it is related to the divine words that bring prayers to the gods and create miracles. Canonically exists, but details are ill-defined and specifics may not be canonical.
