# Metaphysics of Souls

When the physical body dies the soul fades quickly from the [[Plane of Souls]], but does not immediately disappear into nothingness, nor immediately gain everlasting life in some outer realm. Instead, most souls drift towards the [[Land of the Dead]], a mysterious realm with many different names and descriptions. From the [[Land of the Dead]], many souls find their way to some outer realm, of a god, or perhaps the Nine Hells or Arborea or stranger realms. Those not claimed by a god, or similar power, eventually fade away into nothingness, becoming part of the essence of the Land of Dead itself. This journey across the [[Land of the Dead]] is usually thought to take about a week, although some cross it faster, or slower, and souls that are lost can linger much longer, it is thought. What happens to those souls who never leave the [[Land of the Dead]] is a mystery, although many theories persist: some believe they fade away; others believe they are stuck forever, in a kind of limbo.Â Many cultures believe the [[Land of the Dead]] to be dangerous, a place best crossed quickly, and many funerary rituals developed to help souls cross the [[Land of the Dead]]. Other cultures are more concerned with the transition from Taelgar to the [[Land of the Dead]]. But all cultures know that the gods shepherd souls in some fashion, and that mortal actions can help - or hinder - a soul's journey. 

Some cultures may also be aware of the [[Gidari]]. See [[Land of the Dead#Inhabitants of the Land of the Dead]].

Those souls which do not enter the [[Land of the Dead]] become stuck on the [[Material Plane]], perhaps becoming ghosts.

Amongst humans, there is also an ancient idea, dating back to the first creation of humans on [[Hkar]], that these transitions, and in particular the transition of the soul from the [[Plane of Souls]] to a body at birth, and from Taelgar to the [[Land of the Dead]] at death, are minor miracles, granted by the gods to each human born. In general, human cultures believe souls are the continuity of the living person, and care deeply about the soul reaching a final resting place.

Other species may have similar, or different, beliefs about the transition of a soul, but broadly share the same metaphysical truths. 

%% Note: This could drive a variety of thoughts about abortion, miscarriage, and early childhood death. Some cultures may see the soul as coming to the body at the quickening, when the baby first kicks - others at birth, and perhaps others at some naming rite some number of days (or perhaps even a year) after birth. 

These would obviously have very significant impacts on pregnancy and childhood death, as I think a universal truth would be that before the soul comes to the body it is not truly human, and afterwards, it is.

Within the human cultural traditions, there are potentially (at least) two different strands of thought on the relationship between the soul, the [[Land of the Dead]], and the gods: one amgonst the Drankorians and some related descendant cultures (basically cultural descendants of the Hkar urban elite), the other amongst (some of the) earlier departures from Hkar. In Drankor and its descendants there is a much more individual-centered view of the soul. Ghosts are not created because of failures of the gods, they are due to personal failings of the individual. 

While a Deno'qai or Zimkan (??) might think of ghosts/wraiths/specters and other incorporeal undead as lost souls, not necessarily to blame for their condition but people who the gods/community failed, Drankorians (and Chardonians, etc) might instead think of these as doomed/cursed/failed souls, people whose personal flaws prevented them from accepting the gift of the gods to depart the world.

This idea might be worth playing with or expanding and could provide some interesting divides amongst humans.

### Necromancy

See notes on [[Undead]].

These metaphysics have implications for how necromancy and undeath is seen, which, although it varies across cultures, has some commonalities. Some types of undead, such as skeletons, ghouls, and zombies are purely animated by necromantic forces. These undead have no relationship to the [[Plane of Souls]] and merely require a physical body. 

Other types of undead, such as ghosts, specters, and wraiths are the disembodied souls, usually of those souls who were lost on the Material Plane (although who knows what magic can do). 

The scariest undead are those where a body and a soul are brought together in undeath. In some cases, these are unwilling - a soul trapped in their own dead body, under control of a necromancer. In other cases, a sentient creature becomes undead willingly. In general though, these undead are rare. 

Most traditions are concerned with ensuring that the soul makes it to the afterlife, which is thought to put it out of reach of any danger, and perhaps, with ensuring the body cannot be animated (for example, by cremation).
