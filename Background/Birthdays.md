# Birthdays

%% the text should likely be cleaned up if this is going to be published regularly, but is fine as is for a background note %%

This note collections information (generic and specific) about what people do about birthdays in Taelgar. 

## Overview

It is not common or likely that many cultures in Taelgar celebrate "modern" birthdays, with a specific day-and-date and a glorification of an exact age (especially age, which is likely not well known by most people on Taelgar). 

That said, a few variants or things might be common:

* Age-based rituals (i.e. similar to bnei mitvot or confirmations or baptisms even, things that happen at a specific age)
* A culture where the day of your birth is held to be a day you are close to the divine, which might lead to glorification/celebration of the specific day you were born (so you might know you were born on Oct 26 but not exactly how old you are)

Alternatively, a culture where it just doesn't matter is entirely plausible as well.

## Sembaran Traditions

In Sembara, the following points are true:

* The birth date of anyone with wealth or title is typically recorded to facilitate inheritance and land claims, usually via the land courts (of course, typically doesn't mean always). 
* Amongst peasants or those with just a little land, a specific birth date is much less likely to be recorded - there is no tradition of baptism to create baptismal records and the like. 
* Most people would know what year they were born ("I was born in the 26th year of of old Queen Cece's reign...") but not necessarily the day, and knowing someone's exact age is not common. An exact age can also be hard to calculate: someone might know its the 7th year of Robert I's reign, but not quite remember which year Cece died, and so the math gets hard for how old someone born in 26 Cece is, especially when the regnal year might be more or less than a year.
* Most people would know the season they were born in, even if they don't know the exact year or date (" I was born in lambing season in the 8th year of Robert's reign... or was it the 7th? anyway it was before the great flood..."). 
* There is a specific age of maturity (14 or 15, haven't decided exactly) and that would be something that mattered for being able to sign binding contracts (again, mostly around land deals).
* Regencies of nobles are not specifically set: it is more about a specific will or inheritance or other document drawn up by a king/queen/royal council that a common, standardized age (e.g., "The regeant will be so-and-so until my daughter is 22" or "until my daughter marries" or "until my son has a child" or whatever).

This point may or may not be true, but wouldn't be incongruous if introduced:
* It is pretty common for families to celebrate their _kids_ birthdays, in the form of "blessings for another year of health and thanks for not dying" basically, but as a tradition that fades out as kids leave home and grow up.
