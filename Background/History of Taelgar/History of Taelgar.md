# History of Taelgar
This is an attempt to organize the notes and background we have on the history of Taelgar into a single document that can be considered relatively canonical. This is intended to be conversational and living, with the following conventions:

Information in %% notes %% is brainstorming or non-canonical. This document attempts to keep from growing too much by creating separate notes for other periods and other aspects where more detail is needed.

## Overview
The mythic history of Taelgar is organized around four major metaphysically distinct eras, each marked by significant changes to the extraplanar order. 

In broad strokes, the history of Taelgar can be summarized as:

The **[[Age of Myth]]**, when the multiverse was new, a period before time itself was created. The Age of Myth begin with the first act of creation and is a time of the powerful, mysterious magical beings, perhaps somehow related to the [[Children of the Riving]]. It is a time when the power of arcane magic coursed unchecked through the multiverse and altering reality was as simple as a thought. This was a time of huge empires and incredible acts of magic, but also of much chaos. This age ended with [[The Riving]], when the [[Divine Presence]] separates the planes of existence from each other and creates the [[Material Plane]].

The **[[Age of Creation]]**, when the first divinities came into being, and the [[Elder Folk]] flourished. This age began as the [[Multiverse]] was established by the [[Divine Presence]], and the [[Embodied Gods]] created the [[Elder Folk]]. This is the golden age of the non-human species, when the vast civilizations of [[elves]], [[Dwarves|dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], and others spread across the world, but also a time that lacked dynamism. Little changed or was truly new in this age, as the [[Embodied Gods]] of the [[Elder Folk]] channeled the raw creative force of [[~soulstuff~]] into sameness and uniformity. The Age of Creation ended with the [[Creation of Humans]] and the breaking of the barriers that contained and constrained the creative force of [[~soulstuff~]].

The **[[Age of Divinity]]** began with the [[Creation of Humans]], and the shattering of the walls that isolated the [[Material Plane]] and kept the creative force of [[~soulstuff~]] from affecting the wider multiverse. Humans, created by the [[Divine Presence]] itself on [[Hkar]], were unlike anything that had come before, for they were granted the Divine Spark, the ability of their beliefs to shape the very reality of the multiverse, creating [[Incorporeal Gods]] out of the material of creation itself. This was an age of great change, as the greatest hopes and darkest fears of humanity were manifest in [[~soulstuff~]]. It was also an age when other, darker things were created by the machinations of the [[Void Mind]]. The Age of Divinity ended with the the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the destruction of [[Hkar]], and the diminishment of the power of the Divine Spark on the [[Material Plane]]. 

The **[[Age of Humanity]]** began with the sinking of [[Hkar]] and the reshaping of the world that accompanied the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. This age saw the rise and fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], and the rise and fall of [[Cha'mutte]], and much growth and change among human cultures. This age saw, for the first time, humanity growing to dominant the cultures of Taelgar, and the history of this age is dominated by the history of humanity. 
## Age of Myth

The [[Age of Myth]] was an era before time had meaning, and before the separation of the planes. Although it is difficult to speak of "events" in this period, the key events of the Age of Myth were:

* The birth of the [[Divine Presence]] and the awakening of the [[Void Mind]]
* The creation of the antecedents and predecessors of the [[Children of the Riving]]. These might powerful beings of magic, perhaps, born some similarity to their modern day echoes, but perhaps did not. The upheavals of the Riving changed many things. 

These powerful magical beings created many things, and although great empires and cities arose and disappeared, nothing was stable. 

The Age of Myth ended with [[The Riving]], which lead to the creation of the [[Mulitverse]]. 

Key points:
- During the Age of Myth, there is no conception of other planes or a complex cosmos/multiverse. The material plane itself is infused with limitless arcane energy, and magic is easy and powerful. 
- There are no gods but the [[Divine Presence]], and no humanoids. All that exists are the magical beings that are the predecessors of the [[Children of the Riving]]. 
- The form of the world is totally unfixed, as the powerful entities who live on what is Taelgar then use arcane magic to constantly reshape the world into their imagining, and linear causality does not necessary work the way humanoid minds expect. 

## The Riving

Between the end of the [[Age of Myth]] and the beginning of the [[Age of Creation]] was an event, [[The Riving]], both instantaneous and eternal, a time out of time when the basic form of the  [[Multiverse]] was fixed by the [[Divine Presence]]. During [[The Riving]]:
- The chaotic arcane energy of true magic was pulled from the [[Material Plane]], separating the [[Plane of Magic]] from the Material Plane and creating the [[Ethereal Plane]]. [[Ley Lines]] are thought to be the scars of this event, through which arcane magic can still reach into the world, but requiring significant effort and skill. 
- At this moment of separate, the [[Children of the Riving]] were in some way created. Many fled the [[Material Plane]], and shaped their own realms from the raw energy of magic. The most prominent of these are the [[Elemental Realms]]; whether other Energy Realms exist is not recorded. 
- The force of this rupture created resonances and echos that still reverberate to the current day, and which shaped and guided the [[Echo Realms]]. Most prominent among these is the [[Feywild]], an echo of the [[Material Plane]], and home to the domains of the Archfey. But many other [[Echo Realms]] are thought to exist, shaped from the resonances that still surround the [[Inner Realms]] of the multiverse. 
- During [[The Riving]], the [[Divine Presence]] spun out from itself a creative force, distinct from the chaotic energy of the [[Plane of Magic]], the raw material of sentience and self-awareness, in the form of the [[Astral Plane]]. From this creative power, the [[Embodied Gods]] came into being.
- As [[The Riving]] came to an end, the [[Embodied Gods]] created the [[Elder Folk]], sentient species endowed with souls made of this raw material of creation, [[~soulstuff~]]. 

%% at least some [[far realms]] "cracks" appear during the RIving, as this is theoretically when the Sentient Ocean flees to Taelgar. %%
## Age of Creation
_1 - 1520 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The [[Age of Creation]] began as [[The Riving]] ended, the [[Multiverse]] was fixed in form, and the [[Embodied Gods]], imbued with the power of creation by the [[Divine Presence]], brought into being something new, the [[Elder Folk]], sentient creatures endowed with [[~soulstuff~]] by their divine creators. 

Over the course of the Age, the [[Elder Folk]] learned magic, and writing, and grew, and prospered:

* The elves, while never very numerous, possessed great wisdom, exceptionally long lifespans, and a powerful command of magic. These traits made the elves the undisputed ruler of the age, and they founded two great empires. In the north, the kingdom of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. grew to stretch from the forests south of [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] to the Mostreve Hills and the Cymean foothills. In the south, the kingdom of Tinwerquë spread from sea to sea in the tropical and subtropical forests south of the great savannahs of the interior.  %% Note: Is Tinwerquë canonical? %%
* The stoneborn, even less numerous than elves, and always reclusive, do not figure greatly in the stories that remain from these times. As always, the stoneborn hid away in their barren retreats, in the high peaks, the frozen north, and the depths of deserts. However, legends of great masters of art and craft, trained by the Stoneborn, demonstrate the mark they still made on the world.  
* The lizardfolk remained largely in their homelands, in the vast coastal swamps of the southern [[Green Sea]], stretching from north of what is now the great desert all the way to the Sembaran lowlands.
* The dwarves grew quickly after they awoke under the [[Sentinel Range]], known to them as [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], and began to build great halls, delving deeper underground. During the Age of Creation, the dwarves were little seen to the outside world, as their underground kingdoms slowly grew to span all of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], from the far north to the borders of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. By the end of the Age, they were beginning to stretch out, moving to new mountains in the east and west and north, beginning to excavate and build again. 
* The halflings, always wanderers, spread across the [[Green Sea]], and along the coasts, although from where, originally, they came, lore does not say, and the halflings themselves do not share. While they traveled everywhere, they remained most prevalent along the shores of the [[Green Sea]], along the southeast coast of the continent, and across the great plains of the interior.

%% 
A few points on Elder Folk:
- this narrative is heavily northwestern parts of main continent focused, and we shouldn't forget that these non-humans probably spread over larger areas. 
- the basic logic here sets up the Green Sea as largely halfling/lizardfolk in influence, and the central/west as elven/dwarven, but without much mixing, except e.g. in tyrwinghan/isingue (elves/lizardfolk); foothills of sentienels (elves/dwarves); green sea coasts (halflings/lizardfolk). maybe this is fine, and I think the vibe of vast growing mono-species empires is fine for the pre-history. but worth thinking intentionally about this
- the stoneborn feel underdeveloped and probably need a bit of a clearer history at some point?
%%

%%
Undetermined is when the Orcs were created. One possibility is that orcs, in the far reaches of the world, were created during this period, perhaps concurrently with the rest of the Children of the Embodied Gods. A second possibility is that Thark is not able to create the orcs for some reason until later, either late in the Age of Creation or during the Age of Divinity. From a demographic standpoint, orcs are expected to have a very small initial creation, a very high birth rate, and a very high death rate. So it takes a while for them to be noticed, so they cannot be created too late.

Broadly then, there are three simple possibilities for the orcish creation:
* At the beginning of the Age of Creation, totally unknown to anyone. This works from a "parallel to Elder Folk" but adds some 'darkness' to the otherwise idyllic Age of Creation
* Sometime during the Age of Creation, perhaps late. I'm not sure there are any benefits to this, unless the creation of orcs is meant to be some type of trigger for the creation of humans
* At the beginning or duringthe Age of Divinity. This would make them align with the creation of humans and hobgoblins

It is likely not necessary to decide this at the moment, until/unless we want to flesh out the details of the Age of Divinity and/or the metaphysics of orcs. The most relevant concerns are probably on the transition from "peace" to "defensive empires" amongst the elves and dwarves and the metaphysics of Thark's ability to create orcs in the first place.
%%

And yet, the [[Divine Presence]] was not satisfied. After a millennia, the world of Taelgar was static. While no longer ever changing and full of the chaotic energy of the intermingled planes, in the balance of chaos and order, the pendulum had swung too far. The embodied gods had put too much of themselves into their creations, and year after year followed like clockwork. 
## Age of Divinity
_1520-4122 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The Age of Divinity began in the year 1520 by the Dwarven Count, with the [[Creation of Humans]] on the island of [[Hkar]], raised by the [[Divine Presence]] with the gift of the Divine Spark. Over the next 2500 years, humans grew powerful, and explored across the world, but the Void Mind also worked in the shadows, and the Age of Divinity ends in cataclysm. 

The Age of Divinity, like the Age of Creation, began with an upheaval of the [[Multiverse]], one with far-reaching impacts but a far less dramatic beginning. Throughout the long [[Age of Creation]], the [[Land of the Dead]] formed an impermeable barrier to the magic of creation. Although the [[Embodied Gods]] could easily reach across this barrier, to grant miracles and change the Material Plane, the magic of souls could not act, except through the Embodied Gods. With the [[Creation of Humans]], this changed. 

At the beginning of the Age of Divinity, [[Humans|humanity]] is created, and granted the gift of the Divine Spark, the ability of their souls to work magic and shape the creation of new things in the multiverse. The [[Land of the Dead]] ceases to be a barrier to the magic of creation, and the hopes, dreams, fears, and nightmares of early humans gather force and power. Sometimes shaped by the best of humanity, other times by the twisted creations of the [[Void Mind]], the world in the Age of Divinity is both a more vibrant and more dangerous place, and through the magic of the divine spark, eventually both [[Incorporeal Gods]] and diverse [[Outer Realms]] come into existence.

Additionally, the Void Mind does more two things at this time:
* During the [[Creation of Humans]], manages to [[Creation of the Hobgoblins|create the hobgoblins]]
* Allows or creates cracks in the fabric of reality, allowing the mind flayers and other alien species an entrance into Taelgar 

%% The exact timing of the Void Mind activities is not canonically determined, and is not necessarily linked to specific events%%

As the Age of Divinity begins, the [[Embodied Gods]] of the [[Elder Folk]] sense a turn in the air, a feeling of coming darkness, a premonition, but lacking detail. 

%%exact timing of the sense of forboding is not canonically determined, but the vibe is supposed to be a long period during which most elves discount the dangers predicted, or image it to be about the strange rumors of alien minds in the underdark. whether stoneborn/halflings/lizardfolk are impacted is left undetermined %%

* Among the elves, warnings of danger from [[Elmerca]] begin, and while the elven empires turn to prepare for war, no dangers materialize. Over time, the influence of the ~Wardens of Elmerica~ fade, though the premonitions don't cease. The ~Wardens of Elmerica~ persist as a small, somewhat isolated group, warning of a great danger that never seems to come, while elven society seems to move on around and without them.
* Among the Dwarves, the warnings begin among the ~Cult of the Warrior~, a small group who claim that the Bahrazel known as Azar, the ~Prophet~, is calling them to a new thuhr, a warrior thuhr, to defend the safety of the dwarven people. Dwarven society splits among those who turn to fortifications and defense, and those who wish to flee the mountains, for few dare to reject warnings of the ~Prophet~. For several generations, there is stasis, and debate, until the first wars between the mind flayers and the dwarves erupt deep beneath the earth. Many dwarves, who later become the gnomes, flee the mountains. Many others stay, and fortify their homes. The warrior thuhr becomes established as the defender of dwarven society, deep below the earth.  %% this is one version of events, could be edited / elaborated on; in any case the vibe is supposed to be that the underdark is dangerous but the surface world is not%%

The Age of Divnity aligns with the grow and expansion of humanity, and in many ways the growth of humanity, and humanity's interaction with the non-human races, is the most important story of the age. The specific history of Hkar is intentionally left blank, although there are some events that are dated back to Hkar (in particular, the story of  [[Sarqon]] and the [[Chainshroud]] as recounted by the [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Binding Stones]]). Instead, it is best to understand the events on Hkar via the influences they had on religious history, and the migrations from Hkar (which then had significant effects on the development of other human cultures outside of Hkar).
### Growth of Humanity
*roughly 1520-2200, about 700 years*

The first period of humanity on Hkar, is best thought of as the era of personal deities.  This period is characterized by:
* Simple religious beliefs focused around the concept of each human having a personal god
* Extremely rapid population growth as humanity spreads across an idyllic, empty homeland
* A culture without access to arcane or primal magic, but with a rich and complex relationship to "miracles"
* The origin of many [[Outer Realms]] as the divine spark within the early humans influences the spiritual realms

During this time, cults start to develop, as charismatic humans realize that if other people worship their personal gods, they get stronger. This rapidly develops into a widely diverse set of beliefs that could all be characterized as "small gods". This period is characterized by a diversification of culture on Hkar, as different religious practices fragment the uniformity of the early human culture. Exactly what this means is intentionally left blank. Religiously and magically, little changes.

%% exactly how the first 1000 years of humanity is divided into the "era of personal deities" and the "era of cults" is left unclear. the vibe here is rapid growth, rich miracles, and some religious experimentation towards the end of the period, but no incorporeal gods. the religious experimentation that happens is all around gods that are thought to dwell, with humans, on the material plane itself, and not in outer realms beyond the land of the dead.

metaphysically, this is then a time of the development of a variety of fates of souls:
- the various non-divine outer planes ("primal planes") grow around this time, as they attract/gather souls. not all of this is pleasant, and potentially some of this could involve things like demons stealing souls from the land of the dead. probably should be some kind of plane like Hades from Greek myth here, a kind of bland final resting place where weak souls eventually fade. might be metaphysically interesting for this to be basically empty in the modern day...
- there are probably also some ideas about souls "returning to the plane of creation", which is ultimately made of ~soulstuff~ anyway, and so in some cases this is kind of like a "merge with the divine presence" fate for souls once people die. in some cases this might be seen as a kind of precursor to reincarnation, even. 

the general vibe is supposed to be that  this is basically "pre-history" in a sense
%%

### Contact with the Elder Folk
*roughly 2200-2500, about 300 years*

After 700 years of growth and development in isolation on Hkar, the [[Elder Folk]] and humans make contact around the year 2200. Exactly how this happens is not defined, but the impact on [[Hkar]] is large, for two reasons: humanity begins to learn other forms of magic (arcane and primal magic), and begins to imagine divinities as external, powerful entities. The rapid explosion of magical knowledge on Hkar upends human society and leads to a rapid era of cultural evolution. 

%% this could, potentially, be the cause of the first migrations, probably also plants the seeds for the urban/mariner split later, but none of this needs to be fleshed out yet. %%

### Migrations and Emigration
*roughly 2500-3500, about 1000 years*

%%

proposing an alternative timeline that would shift the contact with elder folk period a little earlier, and move the northern migrations *after* contact, as the beginning of a wave of emigrations triggered in part by the social and cultural upheavals caused by the introduction of arcane magic and the idea of incorporeal gods 

this is also the period where the events of the Sarqon and the Chainshroud presumably happen (e.g. between 2600-2800)

%%

Amidst the cultural, religious, and social upheavals spiraling from contact with the Elder Folk, Hkar begins to undergo rapid development and evolution, accompanied by waves of migration and emigration to the land of the [[Elder Folk]], the mainland of Taelgar. 

%% exact dates are not yet canonical %%

At the beginning of this period, around 2500, the first humans leave Hkar (the Northerners, in later parlance). The reasons for this are undefined and unclear, but:
* These migrants are not explorers or colonists, but settlers. That is, they do not have a lot of contact back with Hkar %%although some exceptions might exist%%
* They land first on the southwestern coast, near modern-day Illoria, and spread north on the western side of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], before crossing the mountains in the far north and spreading east. They bring with them a variety of [[Northern Folk Religions]], all derived from the common religious practices.
* This first wave of migrants peaks around 2800, and declines quickly after that. 
* This is probably associated in part with a cultural/religious transition on Hkar, such that there are few/no worshippers of "small gods" left on Hkar after about 2800-2900. 

The second wave of migration, the Southerners, is canonically something that happened but also intentionally left as a blank slate. It is between the northern and mariner migrations in time. These people are culturally distinct from the Northerners, and settle predominantly to the south and east of Hkar. 

%% the period between the northerner departures and the mariner migration is intentionally left open, and other cultural migrations could occur during this period. %%

The third wave of migration, the Mariners, is the source of the [[Languages#Eastros Language Family|Eastros languages]] and many of the eastern Green Sea cultures. This starts around 3500 and peaks soon after, perhaps 3650 %% need to work out how this fits with the timelines of humanity in the eastern Green Sea %%. This migration departs from the western edge of Hkar, and sails around the world to the eastern edge of the Green Sea. %% the route is not strictly canonical, although the mariners settling first on the eastern shores of the green sea is %%

In between these major waves of migration from Hkar, there are several smaller ones:

* The canonical Dunmari migration
* Others, potentially, to be determined

It is likely that all migrations after the second wave are culturally cohesive groups, leaving Hkar in some part as a rebellion or in contrast to the growing magical, urban, pantheonic culture of Hkar. 
### Arcane Hegemony
*roughly 3500-4122, about 600 years*

%% nothing is strictly canonical here %%

With the departure of the mariners, the culture of humanity on Hkar grows to become dominated by an educated urban elite, wielding arcane magic, and allied with a group of elves, who became known as the peronar, who taught and guided the development of magic among humanity. 

During this time:
- Mos Numena becomes the dominant religion on Hkar
- Many arcane spells are invented by humanity and magic grows dramatically in power
- Additional minor migrations, typically of small, culturally cohesive groups, leave Hkar, potentially in contrast/rebellion/disagreement with the growing arcane, urban hegemony on Hkar

This era ends with the Downfall, the ~100 year war that sees the destruction of Hkar.

%% some notes from Discord on the Downfall Wars

1. When the Divine Presence creates Hkar + the humans, there is literally something metaphysical of themselves that is embedded in Hkar or a part of Hkar. This strengthens and empowers the divine spark in the humans. During the Downfall Wars, the agents of the Void Mind learn of this, and realize if they can possess and corrupt this whatever, they can destroy and corrupt everything that was imagined with the divine spark, perhaps even humanity itself, and dramatically weaken the Divine Prescene. End the ability to create, at some level. And although the battle is still raging, and the Void Mind forces haven't won, it is too much of a risk. And so the Divine Prescence takes back this whatever which sinks Hkar. And metaphysically, makes them farther away from Taelgar, and makes the creation of new gods harder, weakens divine magic.
2. I think my idea of the vibe of the downfall based on this new idea of the void mind wanting to corrupt hkar is that "without our actions, hkar would have been overwhelmed, but ultimately without the sinking of hkar the war could never have ended". So basically, destruction of hkar was a necessary cost, but without the price paid by the firstborn, probably the armies that reached hkar would have achieved their goal and captured the divine spark or whatever before hkar could be destroyed. something like that
%%

## Age of Humanity
_4122 - present by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The [[Age of Humanity]] begins in the cataclysm of the destruction of [[Hkar]] and the devastation this causes, and runs to the current day. This time encompasses the rise and fall of the [[Drankorian Empire]] and significant changes in the [[Western Green Sea]] and [[West Coast Region]], as well as the rise of the [[Dunmar|Dunmari]], the [[Great War]] and the defeat of [[Cha'mutte]], the [[Blood Years]], and the recovery and growth of humanity in the time after.
