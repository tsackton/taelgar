%% NEEDS CLEANUP %%

And yet, Arha and Malik were not satisfied. After millenia, the world of Taelgar was static. While no longer ever changing and full of the chaotic energy of the intermingled planes, in the balance of chaos and order, the pendulum had swung too far. The embodied gods had put too much of themselves into their creations, and year after year followed like clockwork.

### The Creation of Humans

So Arha and Malik created one last thing: the humans. To give them time to grow, they raised a great land in the [[Endless Ocean]] to be their homeland, which became known as Hkar. At first, little changed, although in the reckoning of elven scholars, the creation of humans -- the final great act of Creation by the gods in the world of Taelgar -- marks the end of the Age of Creation, and the beginning of the third age of the world.

Arha and Malik breathed something new into humans that would change the history of Taelgar dramatically: the power of divine belief. Elven scholars and theologians have debated for centuries the nature of the divine spark gifted to humanity, and how these powerful Incorporeal gods were able to arise from belief alone. But despite long centuries of thought and debate, knowledge of the birth of incorporeal gods remains the ineffable mystery of Ahra and Malik. No one can say for sure how new gods are born, or how old gods fade away, and exactly how the essence of humanity generates the divine magic in the world. 

As humans spread across Hkar, aware of the divine presence in everything but without the names of gods to worship -- for Arha and Malik did not answer their prayers or manifest themselves in the world for humans to see -- the first human religions began to take shape, and the first Incorporeal Gods came into being.

### The Last Despairs

As the new race of humans spread across Hkar, the Three Despairs acted one final time. As Arha and Malik stepped in to the world to give the divine spark to humans, the Void Mind and its unchildren trickled in to Taelgar. As they did so, the Void Mind began to pick at the scabs of the tear in the multiverse from the Riving. Over time, these tears widened to cracks, and the alien terrors of the Far Realm began to leak through. Deep underground, far below the kingdoms of the dwarves, eldritch horrors began to gather from these alien realms.

  

Meanwhile, the Three Despairs, out of the mold of the humans, breathed to life a new race, the goblinoids, a race of people that would have no god, that would see no Divine, that would forsake the divine spark of humans. These were a diverse people of many forms, not fixed in form by divine will like the elder races, or created with only superficial variety like the humans. But among the various goblinoids, it was the hobgoblins -- intelligent, organized, and cunning in battle -- that came to dominate their kin, the small and sneaky goblins and the strong but lazy bugbears. The hobgoblins were few to begin with, and grew slowly, but implacably they began to see themselves as the rightful inheritors of the world, the pinnacle of Taelgar, the only beings not to depend on the crutch of a Creator God.

### Premonitions

As humans came into the world, and the Void Mind and the Three Despairs acted one last time, many of those of the Elder races felt the change in the world. The elves, sensitive to the shifts in the ages, heard the warnings of Elmerca, a great premonition that a new force, something evil, was growing in the world. Some turned their backs on these warnings, but many began to prepare, building defenses and strongholds against the shadows to come; some elves even turned from their kingdoms and sailed to Hkar, to help teach and prepare humanity. These elves eventually lost some of their elf-ness, and became known as the Peronar. While the elven empires grew to untold heights during the ~Third Age~, for many even the greatest heights of the elven empires were touched with the knowledge of what was to come.

  

Among the dwarves, the premontions of evil lurking the deeps led to a great schism. Many counseled that the dwarven flee their underground halls, seal the doors and great halls with the might of their magic, and turn their backs on the lives of the ancestors, seeking a new way aboveground. Others refused, arguing that they could not abandon the homes of the Bahrazel, the homes of their ancestors, and that they must stay and fight. This schism led to the Great Sundering of the Dwarves, with those who left the mountains heading east, and eventually settling in the high deserts in the very center of the continent, calling themselves the gnomes.

  

Little is recorded in human histories of the impact of the turning of the age on other Elder races, although many speculate that at least the lizardfolk, now known as bringers of prophecy and omen, must have seen something of the history to come.

### The First Generations on Hkar

For a millenia, the early generations of humans lived on Hkar, and spread out across the land as they began to build the rituals of birth, growth, adulthood, and death that make up life. Few cities existed at this time, as humans were still scarce, and were still inventing society. But the land was bountiful, disease rare, and humanity spread like wildfire.

This was a time of rich belief. In the first, early days after the Creation of Humanity, humanity was tinged with the afterglow of the Divine, the people and the land of Hkar having newly sprung from the essence of Ahra and Malik. Still echoing with the Divine magic of their creation, the divine spark, the essence of humanity that empowers their belief to bring Incorporeal Gods into being, was particularly strong. In the first generations after the Creation, as the humans prayed to their creators, and received no answers, the idea of intercession began to develop. Humans began to realize the truth, that Ahra and Malik will not answer them, and that their creators will speak to them only through intermediaries.

This belief, and the prayers and curses of the earliest humans created the primordial gods -- the first intercessory gods, given life on the extraplanar realms of Celestia, Arborea, the Abyss, and the Nine Hells, in order to bring the prayers, curses, fears, and hopes of humanity back to the Divine Presence. While little comes down today of the worship practices of these early traditions, the gods of these realms are primordial, the divine embodiment of the raw power of these early human cultures.
### Early Exploration

After many generations on Hkar, humanity began first tentative ventures out across the ocean. These early sailors discovered the mainland, encountering the Elder races for the first time. Over the next four hundred years, the first wave of human migrants departed Hkar. Even the elven scholars who witnessed these first migrations are no longer sure of what drove people to leave their homeland: what is an attraction and desire to interact with other races, a desire for space and open land, or some kind of cultural split on Hkar itself? 

#### The Northern Migrations

The first slow trickle of migrants arrived and settled in the shadow of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]], in what is now the coast of western Dunmar. These people, the Northerners, began to move north into land that was largely empty, on the far western shore of the continent, beyond the borders of the empires of the Elder races. Living in small villages and family groups, often in the shadow and protection of elves or other Elder races, this first wave of emigration brought with it from Hkar a set of languages, the Northros tongues, and religious tradition, the Northern Folk Religions. 

  

Over the next thousand or more years, this culture spread northward along the coast into the cold lands of the Far North, and then east across the mountains, to cold plains of ~KenkuHomeland~ and the highlands of Vostok and Sembara, as far east as the Mostreve Hills, developing diverse languages and religious traditions, almost entirely in isolation from other humans. These people did not build large cities or great empires, never grew large and numerous, and mostly lived their lives in small villages and towns, on the edges of the Elder empires. Only those who eventually settled the island chains of ~IslandChain~ retained some contact and trade with their former homeland of Hkar. 

#### The Southern Migrations

Within a few generations of the Northerners leaving, another, larger mass migration left Hkar, the second, bigger peak of the first wave of emigration. These people are known as the Southerners, and they spread along the coastlines to the south and east of Hkar, moving inland over generations across the main equatorial and south equatorial regions of the continent.

  

The peak of this second early wave of migration was a time of flux on Hkar. A new religious tradition was developing, and the earliest primordial gods were beginning to give way to pantheons, sets of powerful Incorporeal Gods with distinct personalities and the power to control much of the world directly, removing the need for intercessory prayers. As the power of these gods grew, Arha and Malik increasingly become perceived as distant overgods, with little role to play in everyday life. What religious beliefs the southern emigrants held, and whether they brought with them the intercessory traditions of the earliest humans, the emerging pantheon, or some other as of yet unmentioned tradition, is not recorded by the sages.

### The Height of Hkar

Over the next many generations, life on Hkar continued. While those on Hkar largely lost touch with the Northerners, regular trade from the port cities of the east connected the people who emigrated south. As the population on Hkar grew, the eastern portion of the small continent became increasingly urban, and began to rely more and more heavily on magic to ensure sufficient food, water, and sanitation in the large cities of the Hkaran east coast. To the west, on the rocky, rough coastline and mountains of the western portion of Hkar, a mariner culture developed, less urban and more focused on the ocean and exploration.

  

At this time, the pantheonic traditions of worship solidified, and among different cities and populations a few pantheonic traditions began to dominate, worshipping Incorporeal Gods who act in the world on their own, without recourse to Ahra and Malik. While initially a number of diverse pantheons, each often associated with a particular city or region, co-exist, over time one, known as Mos Numena, the worship of the Eight Divines, came to dominate.

  

Whether because of the growing dominance of Mos Numena and its city-states, the increasing population pressure on the island, or something else, in this period the second great migration from Hkar began.

#### The Mariner Exodus 

The western mariners left first. This important mariner culture, largely on the far western coast of Hkar, had been exploring the [[Endless Ocean]], wandering far and wide across the trackless seas, and worshipping their own pantheon of gods. While the details of this ancient mariner religion have been lost to time, many scholars speculate that the ~OceanGod~ of the Skaer Islands was once part of this pantheon, but the rest of the gods of these ancient people have faded away over the millenia. 

  

When they discovered a vast land, far to the west, with a enormous inner sea, they felt called home, and emigrated there in great numbers. They begin to settle on the east coast of the mainland and the eastern end of the [[Green Sea]], where there are relatively few of the Elder races, and no people. 

  

As the mariners spread around the [[Green Sea]], some began to follow a new religious tradition, ~ArhaMalikMeditation~, which preached the primacy of the true gods Arha and Malik, and the importance of meditation practice for reaching them directly. The spread of this new religion caused a schism. Not all of the mariners forsook their old gods, and those who held to the traditional ways sailed west. 

  

As the remnant of the mariners spread into the western [[Green Sea]], some settled on the Skaer islands. Over the long years, the Skaer traditions empowered the ~OceanGod~, and gradually, the rest of the pantheon was forgotten. From here came the ~SkaerReligion~, still practiced among the Skaer islands. Others settled on the coastlines around the Western Gulf, and as their villages moved up the great river valleys of the region, they met the Northerners, their long sundered brethren. The northern folk traditions mixed with pantheonic ideas of the mariners, and a new religion was born, worshipping the local spirits called the Kestavo. 

#### The Slow Emigration 

While the mariner culture left Hkar en mass, during this period of later Hkaran history numerous smaller groups also departed for the mainland. Many of these minor exoduses from Hkar left no descendants to the current day, as their cultures and people were lost to chance and time. But some survived, the most important of which for scholars of the current age are the Dunmari, a small group of emigrants who worshipped a close-knit pantheon of gods, the five Divine Siblings, the children of Ahra and Malik. The early proto-Dunmari settled initially around the northern edge of the desert, in the savanna and semi-arid grasslands, and developed a pastoral culture that emphasized horsemanship. 

#### The State of Human Cultures Before the Downfall

More two millennia after being created on Hkar, humanity had finally spread far and wide. Around this time, five major groups of humanity exist:

  

- On Hkar, a relatively unified culture, with an urban, magical orientation largely worshipping the Eight Divines. This is the vast majority of humanity still.
    
- Around the eastern [[Green Sea]], an ‘eastern’ culture, with a significant seafarer element to their culture. These people, settling in empty land, have a more urban culture than most other mainland humans, and small kingdoms and other political units have developed. They are the second most numerous group of humans.
    

- The eastern culture has two strands, based on a religious split. One strand, the “neo-easterners”, are followers of a new philosophical-religious tradition, which holds that through meditation and practice humanity can access the divine spark directly. The other strand, the “old eastenders”, follow the traditional mariner pantheon of their culture on Hkar. The “neo-easterners” are significantly larger and more widespread than the “old easterners”
    

- On the main continent, spread along the tropical western coast and the equatorial interior, a ‘southern’ culture, the third largest group of humanity, but by a relatively narrow margin behind the easterners. They maintain trade and cultural connections with Hkar.
    
- On the main continent, spread along the temperate west coast, and the central interior and far north, a ‘northern’ culture, with a unique religion based around many small intercessory spirits and semi-divine great heroes. Living almost entirely in the shadow of the Elder race empires, except perhaps on some islands in the [[Endless Ocean]] west of the coast. These people are noticeably less numerous, and more widely spread, than either the Southerners or Easterners.
    
- Across the central plains of the main continent, the proto-Dunmari, with their own unique language and pantheonic religion. They are the smallest group of humanity by a significant margin.
    

  

In a few places, even before the downfall, these cultures were already mixing:

- In the highlands of Sembara and Vostok and the Far North, on the eastern slopes and highlands of the ~CentralMountains~,  the ‘northern’ and ‘eastern’ cultures have encountered each other, and a blended ‘eastern northern’ culture has arisen, with its own religious tradition.
    
- On the central plains and deserts of the main continent, a bit of a melting pot culture with elements of the easterners, southerners, and proto-Dunmari exists, but this region has a very low population density.
    
- Similarly, on the east coast, the Easterners and Southerns are meeting and blending a bit.
    

### The Downfall of Hkar

 %%comment
  basic idea here is that during the third age, the northwest of Taelgar is kind of a backwater, and certainly the land beyond the mountains is very backwater. the real center of everything is the tropics, basically from what is now northern dunmar through the southern green sea and then south to the equator.  
  
then, during the downfall, that region is what suffers the most, outside of Hkar. so what is left is people on the fringes. this orients drankor north. if there is a 'southern drankor', it would be very far south, beyond the current world map.

The ~ThirdAge~ ended in fire and cataclysmic, as the allies, servants, and slaves of the Three Despairs burst into the world in conflict and war. Although this war touched all the land of Taelgar, the greatest fighting was on the central coasts of the western shore, in the land that was southern heart of the great Elven kingdom of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]], and further south to the northern edges of Tinwerquë. A great host sailed for Hkar, striking at the heart of the human world, where they overwhelmed the defenses of the Hkarans. As last, desperate act, Arha and Malik sank the land of Hkar, and great destruction followed. Many humans died, but so too did many more hobgoblins, orcs, and horrors of the deeps. While the ~GreatWarI~ was not a total victory for the humans, elves, and allies, it was not a defeat, and despite enormous loss, the spawn of the Despairs were diminished, never to recover completely to their former strength.
