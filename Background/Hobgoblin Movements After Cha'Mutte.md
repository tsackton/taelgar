# Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte

After the death of Cha'mutte, the large hobgoblin forces assembled for the Great War are left without magical support, and begin to disperse, move, and raid in various ways. In many ways, the movements of these hobgoblin groups define the period from ~1545 - 1600, often referred to as the [[Blood Years]]. 

Draws heavily from:
- [[Discord Chat - Chardon History]]
- [[Discord Chat - Grand Sweep of History]]

## Southern Army

The Southern Army, consisting of the Iron Fang, Bitter Knife, Blackened Claw, Death Moon, and possibly other clans, is responsible for conquering Isingue, and blockading the Dunmari borders to prevent a Dunmari breakthrough to help relieve Isingue. 

(the exact larger purpose of this front is not totally clear but is irrelevant here). 

As the plague spreads along the Upper Istaros after Cha'mutte's death, many of these hobgoblins die, and others may have fled east or south into the northeastern part of the [[Drankorian Hinterland]] or the southern part ("[[~South Cymea~]]") of the [[Western Green Sea]], and are not further considered here. 

### Iron Fang

*Bloodlust Wars: Iron Fang against Sembara in 1540ss*

North of [[Isingue]], the Iron Fang clan survives mostly intact, and once the red mists leave, launches an attack on Sembara. This is the [[Bloodlust Wars]], from ~DR 1547 - DR 1549, although exact dates are probably not canonical. They are defeated, but not totally eliminated. Some hobgoblins flee into the Plaguelands, while others maybe join with remnants of [[Revaka]]'s people who refused to fight for [[Cha'mutte]] in the southeastern foothills of the Sentinels. 

It is not clear how far the Iron Fang clan got, and the extent of this war is flexible. Fighting reached at least into [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] (e.g., Derik III is killed fighting near [[Valarin]]), but while [[Cleenseau]] is fortified it is not directly threatened during the Bloodlust Wars ([[Cleenseau History Notes]]). 

Possibly some historians consider this part of the Great War. 

### Bitter Knife

*Bitter Knife War: Bitter Knife against Dunmar, 1550s - 1570s*

The largest survivors of the Southern Army. Establish a kingdom in the [[Nashtkar]], around the southeastern edge of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]. This is marginal terrain, and survive mainly by raiding the surviving Dunmari. This quickly leads to the [[Bitter Knife War]], in the DR 1550s, lasting for ~30 years. While a handful of survivors possibly escaped Dunmar's victory, Bitter Knife is destroyed as a functional organization at the end of the [[Bitter Knife War]], and the clan goes extinct.

### Blackened Claw

*Northern War: Blackened Claw against Dunmar, 1603-1610*

The origins of the Blackened Claw clan are not clear, but probably either a smaller part of the original army, or a new group formed by various survivors in the western Plaguelands. This is a far less organized group than the Bitter Knife, and they live a very marginal existence in the deserts and foothills. Possibly these are hobgoblins that originally settled near [[Xurkhaz]] but are pushed out by the [[People of the Rainbow]] (Xurkhaz is founded in DR 1583), or possibly something else happens. Whatever their history, the Blackened Claw end up conquering a decent part of far northeastern Dunmar, around [[Raven's Hold]] and parts west and south, although not as far as [[Karawa]], but are ultimately defeated by Dunmar during the [[Northern War]]. Like the Bitter Knife tribe, the Blackened Claw ceases to exist as a meaningful force after its defeat in the Northern War. 

In the years after the Northern Wars, [[Shakun's Protection]] becomes fully functional and hobgoblin raiders cease to be a problem in Dunmar. 

## Northern Army

The Northern Army is larger than the Southern Army. Originally based in Pandar. One possible outline is that a major thrust of the Great War is Cha'mutte's efforts to capture Urlich Monastery, and the basic logic is to have the Northern Army marching south on the west side of the mountains, and the Southern Army marching north on the east side of the mountains. 

The Northern Army canonically includes the Shattered Ice clan, as well as other as-yet-unnamed clans. 

At the time of Cha'mutte's death, the northern army likely occupies a large area south of Pandar, extending at least as far as the [[Blackwater Fens]]. They are likely engaged in active combat with Amani and Volganis, and possibly have already conquered [[West Coast History Framework#Other Realms|"northern kingdom 4"]]. 

At this point, the northern army fractures. 

### Eastern Split
#### Dragon Conclave

*Conclave War: Dragon Conclave against elves and Chardon, 1545 - 1550s*

One part of the Northern Army, led by a conclave of dragons and probably the most loyal of Cha'mutte's followers, launch a brutal war of revenge targeting primarily the elves and Chardon. Possibly some historians consider this part of the Great War. 

The Conclave War is a brutal fight and leads to much destruction. Chardon eventually wins. The dragons are destroyed, but hobgoblins escape (see below). This is probably the main war that causes the destruction of Volganis. 

#### Shattered Ice Clan

*Concave War against Chardon, 1545-1550s; Hobgoblin wars against Sembara, 1570s-1650*

The Shattered Ice clan joins the Conclave War, but for whatever (as yet undetermined) reason, they escape destruction. At the end of the Conclave War, a well organized group of hobgoblins flees east, into the Sentinels and establish themselves. 

About a generation later, they launch the [[First Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]], and over the next 100 years conquer and then lose a bunch of territory in [[Greater Sembara]], (cf [[Timeline of Sembaran History#The Hobgoblin Wars]]). At the conclusion of the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]], the Shattered Ice clan is functionally destroyed, although isolated hobgoblin raiding groups survive in the lower slopes of the Sentinels. 

### Western Split
_[[~North Chardon Coast~]] Conquest, 1550s - 1650s_

On part of the northern army - potentially more interested in a place to live and conquest than revenge or destruction - appears on the North Chardon Coast in the 1550s. They methodically conquer the [[~North Chardon Coast~]] over the next several years (exact timeframe is unclear but likely a relatively quick push south, perhaps over just a year or so). This force is stopped by a Chardonian army somewhere not to far from Chardon, and then a stalemate occurs. 

For the next 30 - 50 years, these western hobgoblins rule over a [[~North Chardon Coast~]] realm. Sometime after the [[War of the Dark Rift]], Chardon turns north and methodically eliminates these hobgoblins.

Open questions:
* How did they get to the north coast? Presumably some type of magic sailing option, but other ideas could be Cha'mutte's armbands/teleport stuff
* What happened to them? Do any still linger i.e. in the [[~Mawakel Border Mountains~]] or [[Tawir Forest]] or elsewhere, or were they all wiped out by Chardon?
* What is the timeline exactly? The 1550s to 1650s is not strictly canonical, but Chardon cannot be dominating the [[Northwest Coast]] until the 1650s-1670s, to give the Mawar renaissance a chance to blossom; these hobgoblins partly serve that purpose

### Central Split
*War against Amani 1545-1550s, defeat by 1600*

One part of the Northern Army - potentially hobgoblins, but also potentially something else - advances south into Amani, and then more or less stays, laying waste to Amani and whatever fragments of Volganis survived the [[Conclave War]]. 

The basic vibe - details are not canonical - is something brutal, bent on destruction. Everyone in Amani flees or is killed; this is not a force that is looking to rule a kingdom of humans. For some undetermined reason they don't advance as far south as Lake Valandros or as far west as the coast, so there are pockets of humans that survive, more robustly along the coast than pressed up against Lake Valandros. However, these pockets of humanity are under constant threat - the vibe is more like frequent raids (perhaps capturing prisoners for whatever reason) and the occasional (attempted) sacking of a settlement, and less a sustained war. 

Sometime around 1600, this force occupying Amani is decisively defeated by someone (possibly a classic D&D campaign-type story where it is mostly just a party of high level adventurers), but crucially not Chardon or Mawar. The destruction of this force, despite the hobgoblins to the south, leads to Mawar opening up and the Mawar Renaissance, which is really a northern coastal renaissance also involving the people living west of Amani (who might or might not be culturally linked to Mawar, but are definitely economically linked). 

## Other Forces

- Ulrich Pass Army is presumed destroyed during the cataclysm on Cha'mutte's death.

## Current Day

In the current day, the remnants of Cha'mutte's armies may be found:

### South and East of the Sentinels

*Canonical*
- In the Plaguelands, some remnant of the Iron Fang survived, and potentially established a robust hobgoblin realm somewhere in the Plaguelands. These have been relatively isolated from humans since their defeat in the [[Bloodlust Wars]], but could potentially be a source of any hobgoblin attack on Orenlas, Addermarch, or related areas. 
- In the Plaguelands are also some scattered remnants of the Southern Army, not really well organized into proper clans. These would occupy the far southeastern foothills of the Sentinels, and areas north, possibly along the upper reaches of the [[Kulthul]]. These hobgoblins are too disorganized and scattered to pose a significant threat, but could explain details such as watchtowers on the northwestern borders of [[Xurkhaz]], and the general vibe of defensive fortifications in [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] and the [[March of Andonne]]. Note: while the existence of the possibility of hobgoblin raiders around the western edge of the Plaguelands is canonical, whether they are as disorganized as this makes it seem is undetermined, and a more organized group may have their own reasons for not advancing in force west or north.
- In the southern [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], around the destruction of [[Urlich Pass]] and the areas immediately south (e.g., the destroyed region of [[Ardith]]), some survivors of the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] and potentially other hobgoblins (e.g., remnants of the [[Dominion of Avatus]] who did not fight for Cha'mutte, or survivors of the [[Bitter Knife War]] or the [[Northern War]]) linger. These are presumably not a well organized group either, but they are a significant enough reserve to occasionally form warbands to try to raid against Sembara in an organized way. There needs to be a sufficient threat for the [[Army of the West]] to be professionalized and important, although the exact history between 1720 and 1749 is unclear.

*Brainstorming*
- It is possible - but not canonically determined one way or another - that other hobgoblins fled east or south from the fallout of the plague, and may exist in the northeastern part of the [[Drankorian Hinterland]] or the southern part ("[[~South Cymea~]]") of the [[Western Green Sea]]. 

### West of the Sentinels

*Canonical*
- Some hobgoblins (exact ancestry and history undetermined) live in the plains and mountains north of Voltara, although they didn't really impact [[Grumella's War]], so are likely either fairly scattered and disorganized, or have their own reasons for staying out of conflict with humans. 

*Brainstorming*
- [[Tawir Forest]], the [[~Mawakel Border Mountains~]], the northwest coast of Lake Valandros, the forests on the eastern shores of Lake Valandros, the Crimson Forest, parts of the northern Myraeni Gap, and potentially the islands of of Mawar all could provide space for hobgoblins with various degrees of organization.
