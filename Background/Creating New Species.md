# Typology for Introducing D&D Creatures
 
The multiverse, gods, and the story of creation are organized somewhat differently in Taelgar than a standard D&D universe. Still, most, if not all, D&D creatures can fit in somewhere. Here are some guidelines.

### Sentient, Self-Aware Natives of the [[Inner Realms]]

These creatures, the sentient, self-aware natives of the [[Inner Realms]], are animated and made aware by the presence of a soul made of [[Soulstuff]]. When these creatures die, this fragment of [[Soulstuff]] typically passes to the [[Land of the Dead]], and eventually beyond into the [[Outer Realms]], to whatever fate awaits. 

What distinguishes these sentient species from each other is typically the manner of their creation. 

1. **Children of the Embodied Gods**. The [[Elder Folk]] -- the elves, dwarves, halflings, lizardfolk, and stoneborn -- are the creations of the [[Embodied Gods]], a unique category of divine being endowed with a physical manifestation by the [[Divine Presence]]. These five species are granted, by connection to their creator deities, unique magical abilities, and dominated much of the early history of the world, giving them a unique place in the current day. In addition to the five species listed, variants may also exist. The gnomes, for example, represent a long-sundered lineage of dwarves, and other long-lost “branches'' of the elder species may also exist. The orcs, although not counted among the [[Elder Folk]], are metaphysically in this category, as the creations of [[Thark]], an embodied god spawned not by the [[Divine Presence]], but by the machinations of the [[Void Mind]]. *Canonically includes: [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk]], [[Halflings]], [[Stoneborn]], [[Orcs]], [[Gnomes]].* ***New creations in this category need compelling justification.***
2. **Direct Creations of the Divine Presence.** Humans, unlike any other known species on Taelgar, are the direct creations of the Divine Presence breathing the essence of creation, the divine spark, into material form. Metaphysically, the [[Goblinoids]] are also in this category, in that they are created by the direct embodiment of [[Soulstuff]] into a living form, but they are the spawn of the [[Void Mind]], acting in secret to steal and twist the power of the [[Divine Presence]]. *Canonically includes: [[Humans]], [[Goblinoids]].* ***New creations in this category need compelling justification.***
3. **Echoes of the Riving**. In the Age of Myth, before the Riving, various powerful beings of infused with magical energy shaped and reshaped reality around them. When the Multiverse was created during the Riving, the echoes of that event rippled and transformed and spread, and in the process spawned sentient beings, infused with [[Soulstuff]]. Dragons, giants, fey, and elementals all trace their origins to this event. *Canonically includes: [[Fey]], [[Dragons]], [[Elementals]], [[Giants]]*. ***New classes of species in this category need compelling justification, but new variants of the four existing species are relatively easy to introduce.***
4. **Corrupted Species.** A number of sentient, self-aware creatures or species were originally something else, but have been cursed or corrupted in some way, often by agents of the [[Void Mind]]. The most common of these are the sentient undead and lycanthropes, but others may exist. This category can also include creatures such as the [[Derro]], once dwarves whose connection to the [[Bahrazel]] was severed by mind flayers to create slaves for their underground empires. *Canonical examples include (incomplete list): many [[Undead]], [[Lycanthropes]], [[Derro]], [[Grimlocks]].* ***New creations tied to existing aberrations or existing aspects of the Void Mind are relatively straightforward to introduce, but novel Void Mind aspects might require some thought.***  
5. **Unusual Species**. Many species, of course, have unique origins that do not neatly fit into any of the categories above. Any species that is a native to the [[Inner Realms]], sentient/self-aware, and does not fit neatly into any of the above categories can fit here. *Canonical examples include:  the [[Kenku]], the [[Merfolk]], [[Centaurs]], [[Bullywugs]], and [[Kobolds]].* ***These should generally only be introduced carefully and for specific reasons.***

### Soulless Natives of the [[Inner Realms]]

These categories of species can be introduced freely, and often don't have origin stories or notes in Taelgarverse. 

6. **Beasts**. Many creatures, typically of limited intelligence and self-awareness, populate the world of Taelgar. The diverse beasts that populate the land, as well as some monstrosities and other such creatures, are not animated by [[Soulstuff]]. These may have been created in many different ways: by the [[Divine Presence]], the [[Children of the Riving]], the [[Embodied Gods]], or other, stranger ways. 
7. **Magical Species**. While beasts, broadly defined, lack sentience and self-awareness, there are many soullless creatures on Taelgar that are nonetheless self-aware. Typically, these species and creatures are the creation of magic, and mimic the awareness created by [[Soulstuff]] with arcane energy. Many constructs, as well as some other creatures, fall into this category. These creatures may arise from experiments, rituals, strong magic, or other extraordinary events. Purely animated/created non-sentient creatures, such as many corporeal undead, golems, and many constructs, may also fall into this category despite lacking any self-awareness beyond the ability to follow orders. 

### Natives of the [[Outer Realms]]

These have well-defined typologies but within the existing typologies can be fairly straightforwardly created. Need to have a home plane.

8. **Children of Creation**. Any creature or species that arises directly from [[Soulstuff]] and is native to the [[Outer Realms]] fits in this category. Classic examples include fiends and celestials. A fundamental aspect of these creatures and species is that they cannot be killed on the material plane: if they are defeated in the [[Inner Realms]], they simply dissipate and reform on their native plane.
9. **Divinities**. Any creature that is a pure representation of the energy of the [[Plane of Creation]] can be considered a divinity. Divinities -- which include the [[Embodied Gods]] and the [[Incorporeal Gods]], as well as creatures such as the [[Tanshi]] and the [[Kestavo]] -- are distinct from the Children of Creation primarily in terms of their power. Left undetermined is whether powerful archdevils and demon lords and the like are more akin to Divinities or Children of Creation. 

### Natives of the Far Realms

10. **Alien Species**. There are many things flung across the universe that are older, and stranger, than the world of Taelgar. Many aberrations, and especially mind flayers, are ultimately invaders from these [[Far Realms]], and many of these invaders created twisted creations to be their slaves, prey, or entertainment, some of whom still linger in the world. While at the moment, the only canonical invaders to Taelgar are from ancient and disturbing [[Far Realms]], some races and creatures that are traditionally associated with Spelljammer in D&D could have an origin via this mechanism, or via a similar “transport from other timelines” type mechanism. *Canonical examples: [[Ithilids]], beholders, aboleths, [[Sentient Ocean]]*. ***Most typical D&D aberrations fit easily into this category, although some care should be given to avoiding too much of a Spelljammer vibe.***

## Decision Tree for Adding New Races

Is the creature part of a civilization with a history, culture, religious beliefs, language, diversity of thought and opinion? 

- No: You are likely looking 6 or 7, or maybe 4; the choice depends largely on lore and fit. In general, 6 is more low-intelligence “natural” species, 7 is more high intelligence “magical” species, and 4 is more "corrupted/cursed" species, but YMMV. For example, hydra are likely 6; dopplegangers are likely 7; medusa are likely 4. 
- Yes, and native to the inner realms:
	- If created by an embodied god, or a variant of such a species: 1 (**rare**: be cautious about introducing new embodied gods or variants of elder folk without very good reason)
	- If created directly by a high god (Divine Presence or Void Mind): 2 (**rare**: be cautious about expanding this list beyond humans and goblinoids without a very good reason)
	- If the species has a vibe of diverse power levels, strong connections to magic, and the potential to have ancient and extremely powerful members, similar to e.g. fey or elementals, and the species potentially has a very long history on Taelgar and/or specific inner realms: 3 (**rare**: be cautious about introducing new echoes of the Riving without a very good reason)
	- If related to mind flayers or other aberrations, to various manipulations of the void mind, or other kinds of corruptions or curses: 4
- Yes, but native to something that isn't an inner plane:
	- Comes from the outer realms: 8
	- Comes from a far realm: 10

If there is not an obvious choice: is it a major part of a campaign (current or past) that, for plot/story reasons, needs a complex culture and backstory?

- Consider whether it could be a Void Mind trick in an existing metaphysical category, e.g. an "evil" myconoid species or insect species, corrupted, awakened by an agent of the void mind, or a "slave species" corrupted by a Far Realm power. Many of these creatures could fit in 4. 
- Consider whether it could be native to a yet-undescribed Far Realm, potentially with a radically different vibe than typical [[Far Realms]], in which case consider 10.
- Consider whether it could represent a extraplanar entity possessing and twisting something native to the Material Plane, in which case 8 could fit. For example, gnolls, who are fiends (demons) insubstantiated into the bodies of carnivores on the material plane, would fit in this category. Should, in this case, be created, not born. 
- Consider whether this might be an exceptional case where a soullless species nonetheless develops into something with depth and culture. Likely, in this case, to require special/extenuating circumstances and likely some strong connection to some kind of magic. An example might, potentially, be some kind of construct species. This could make 7 a reasonable fit. 
- If nothing else fits, consider 5. 

### Key Distinctions of Choices

- Creatures from 1-5 have souls that, when they die, go to the Land of the Dead. Resurrection magic works per the usual Taelgar metaphysics. Creatures from 6-7 simply cease to exist when they are killed, and cannot be resurrected by normal means. Creatures from 8-9 dissipate and reappear on their native plane if killed on the material plane. Creatures from 10 can have any weird or unusual metaphysics desired. 

- Creatures from 1-3 are intended to have unique and rare origin stories:
	- Creatures from 1 are created by embodied gods, which should be rare and individual. Even variants/off-shoots of these should be introduced very cautiously
	- Creatures from 2 are intended to be exclusively humans and goblinoids. Additions here require very careful thought and a compelling motivation
	- Creatures from 3 are intended to capture species that are (a) not associated with spiritual realms, and (b) can potentially have god-like power, but are not simply unique creations, and that have unique shared vibes. While generally it is simple to introduce new **variants** of these species (e.g., a new flavor of fey or giant), adding new entire types here requires careful thought and a clear motivation.

- Creatures from 4 and 7 are a good catch-all category for supernatural villains. Lean towards 4 for intelligence species with either (a) a clear connection to the Void Mind somehow (e.g., undead via Umidzka, lycanthropes via Jinnik), or (b) a persistent culture, language, etc. Lean towards 7 for isolated creatures that wouldn't be thought of as having a culture and society. 
 
- Creatures from 8 are, by definition, not native to the material plane, and vanish to their native plane when killed. Some particularly powerful creatures from 3 may also share this property, especially archfey and elementals, but in this case the key distinction is their native planes are (typically, but there are exceptions to every rule) echo realms or energy planes, not part of the domain of souls (outer planes in traditional D&D terminology).
 
- Creatures from 6 and 7 are distinguished by having no obvious gods or souls or afterlife. Some, such as undead and lycanthropes, may have such a thing from a former existence. Intelligent beast-like creatures that are intended to have souls and possibly worship gods should be 5, unless they are actually a type of fey or elemental (3) or corruptions of the Void Mind (4).

- Creatures from 10 should also not be native to the material plane, but are not from extraplanar realms, at least not ones created by human beliefs. This can be a pretty generic catch-all category for things that come from elsewhere, don’t have a Taelgar specific story, but are useful/interesting for a plot. Twisted creations of mind flayers and aboleths (in particular) would typically be 4, not 10, unless they were "brought over" from the far realm. 

See the [[Species]] section for how this plays out.
