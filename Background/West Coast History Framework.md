This note is intended to summarize a framework for the history of the West Coast, roughly including the [[Greater Chardon]], [[Northwest Coast]], [[Northern Sentinels]], and [[Nevos and Apporia]] regions, as well as parts of the [[Central Highlands]]. This does not deal with the Sentinels themselves or the Nevos Sea. 

This is not intended to be published as is and is not meant to replace a more proper History of Chardon or whatever note. 

Draws heavily from [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]] and [[Discord Chat - Chardon History]]. 

## Pre-Drankor

**There are lots of open places for invention in this era, and the deep history of much of the West Coast remains undeveloped.**

See: [[Historical Framework#Migrations and Emigration]] for some details. 

*Canonical Facts*:
- The first [[~Northerner~]] migrations landed somewhere in the west, gradually spreading north, generally living in the shadow of non-humans before the Downfall. These become the Deno'qai, as well as possibly other as-yet-developed cultures on blank places in the map.

*Ideas:*
- There is room for additional migrations pre-Downfall into this area, potentially adding one or more secondary cultural strands. There is even room for another Dunmari-like minor pantheonic religion. 

## Drankorian Era

See: [[Historical Framework#The Drankorian Era]]

*Canonical Facts:*
- The Drankorian Empire, in a series of wars of conquest, subjugates much of the west coast, extending as far as the northern shores of [[Lake Valandros]]. The exact extend of the Empire is not fully mapped, however:
	- They control enough of the Apporia peninsula to construct the [[Old Chardon Canal]], which despite the name was constructed by Drankorian wizards.
	- They do not control Mawar, although they have sufficient contact and trade with Mawar for Mos Numena to spread there.
	- Elves occupy much of the forests on the slopes of the Sentinels, and these are never invaded or claimed by Drankor.
- This conquest is explicitly more brutal than the Sembaran conquest earlier. The exact implications of this are not determined, but it potentially results in significant population displacement. 

## Before the Great War

The exact history of how the realms and political situation immediately prior to the Great War is left nearly entirely undetermined, although there are some notes in [[Apporia#History]] about the Apporian Peninsula and the rise of [[Cedrano]] as a naval and mercantile power. 

The situation immediately prior to the Great War is laid out here. The borders are not exact as draw, but cover roughly the correct areas. The focus here is on the political and cultural situation at this time, not how it came to be. 

![[west-coast-history-GreatWar.png]]

There are a number of broad cultural/political groups occupying this area at this time
### North Coastal Cultures

Mawar and the "North Bay" culture. The exact cultural history of these groups are not determined, although often assumed to have some northerner connection, and Mawar at least worships Mos Numena, although in a modified form. 
### Deno'qai

The Deno'qai occupy much of the land on the western slopes of the Sentinels that is not claimed by elves, and in some cases living in and among the elven forests. 

### Northern Realms

The five realms marked in yellow have a canonical cultural history that is primarily not Drankorian, although possibly influenced by Drankor. The history of these realms is not established, and whether any of these political units has an ancient history (e.g., was around at the time of the Drankorian Empire, or even before) is undetermined. 

Immediately prior to the great war, however, you have five realms (some of these may represent collections of city states or small empires, or whatever), referred to as Northern Realm 1 - Northern Realm 5 based on map, above. Only two have any development.

#### Amani (NR 2)

Rough notes: This was home to the wizard Airion the Mistspeaker, who was a significant elemental mage before the Great War (and had a cameo in Mawar Adventures via the cursed gatza guy's notes). The details of this kingdom aren't super clear but the vibe is a kind of Deno'qai/Drankor blend with perhaps significant cultural splits. Arcane magic and Mos Numena but also kind of Germanic-ish food/culture (Deno'qai have some pre-Roman Germanic tribes influences). 

All that is canonically established about Amani is vibes: it was a place where magic had influence and was respected, but it was outside the political and cultural orbit of Chardon. 

Given its size, it is possible that Amani was some kind of confederation, or a cultural descriptor for a collection of related kingdoms (ala Christian Spain in the late Middle Ages or something). 

#### Volganis (NR 3)

The only significant detail here is that the "Crown Jewels of Volganis" were taken by a black dragon and kept in his hoard, so presumably this is was kind of centralized monarchy. Might have had a Germanic flavor. 

This is a retcon of what was Volkrad in high school, which was the site of several adventures. 

#### Other Realms

Nothing is particular established about NR 1, NR 4, or NR 5. NR 4 is entirely destroyed in the Great War (see below) and maybe does not need much development. NR 1 and NR 5 potentially survive in some manner. 

### Chardon

When Drankor falls, a lot of academic power moves to Chardon, which becomes something of a mercantile and academic power base for the region, but is, at this time, not really a military or naval power, and certainly not the locus of an empire. 

Chardon likely exerts direct political control only over the immediate hinterlands (south to the [[~Chardon Hills~]]), but canonically has significant cultural influence up the Chasa River valley (which is dotted with small city-states and minor realms, e.g. [[Kin-Aska]]). There are significant trade routes across the mountains to Sembara, also presumably at least in part in Chardon's cultural orbit, if not political orbit. 

### Post-Drankorian Realms

North of Chardon you have a variety of as-yet-undeveloped minor kingdoms in the fertile agricultural land on the coast between Chardon and Mawar. These might be kind of like various German states, perhaps even with a kind of holy-roman-empire-like superstructure, but this is highly undeveloped. 

### Castrella

On the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], [[Castrella]] is a significant maritime, naval, and mercantile power. It is presumably Castrellan navies that control the canal (with some influence from Chardon as magic is needed to navigate the canal most days). Most of Apporia is culturally, and potentially politically, in the Castrella orbit.

### Yeraad Cultures

![[Pasted image 20250131102940.png]]

Roughly speaking, the Yeraad river valley is settled by at least two, and possibly more, cultural strands, though no political details or history exists. 

#### Highland Cattle Culture

The area marked 2 above, and extending east towards the mountains, is a semi-arid land of hills and scrub, perhaps like Texas hill country. A highland culture exists here, but its exact cultural heritage and history are undetermined.

#### Lowland Agricultural Cultural

The area marked 1 above, and potentially extending south along the Yeraad, is fertile Mediterranean lowlands, probably dominated by things like olives. A distinctive culture exists here, but its exact cultural heritage and history are undetermined.

#### Other Yeraad Cultures

Whether anyone lives in the areas marked 3 and 4 above is not clear, and if someone does live there, who they are is undeveloped. 

### Non-humans

Two major non-human cultures exist before the Great War: the elves of [[Ainumarya]], which is the largest and most powerful elven realm at the time, and the lizardfolk of the [[Yeraad River Basin]], also an extensive and significant non-human culture. 

%% not updated below %%
## After the Great War

At the end of the Great War, a large army (Cha'mutte's Northern Army) has conquered most/all of "Northern Realm 4", and sits at the frontiers of Amani and Volganis. From this, we can divide the broad sweep of west coast history into four eras. 
### The Conclave War Period

**Roughly DR 1545 - DR 1560**

During this period, the [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte#Eastern Split|Eastern Branch]] of Cha'mutte's Northern Army moves decisively south in a war of revenge, destroying much of the elven forests and sweeping to the Chasa River Valley in the course of a few years, then continuing in a path of destruction west along the river towards Chardon. The [[Conclave War]] ends with a decision Chardon victory at the [[Battle of Metium]], tentatively around 1556. The Conclave War leaves Volganis, [[Ainumarya]], and much of the upper portion of the [[Chasa River Valley]] in ruins and largely, if not entirely, depopulated. 

After the defeat of the dragon conclave, many hobgoblins are slain by Chardonian forces, but some, under the banner of the Shattered Ice clan, flee east (possibly fighting a small war against the Myraeni Gap people), and settle to lick their wounds around the desolation of Urlich and the Sentinels west of Sembara. They become a major force in Sembaran history, but cease to significantly influence the west coast. 

Also during this period, the [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte#Central Split|Central Branch]] of Cha'mutte's Northern Army moves south into Amani. Amani holds out for longer, and perhaps some people flee to Northern Realm 1 and Northern Realm 5, but by the end of this period the ~Amani War~ is over with a decisive defeat for Amani, which is brutally subjugated by ~something~ (might be hobgoblins, but more likely is something else). 

At the end of the Conclave War Period, you have:
- [[Ainumarya]], Amani, Volganis, and NR 4 destroyed completely; the Chasa River significantly ruined.
- Some kind of evil realm occupying the land that was once Volganis. 
- Shattered Ice hobgoblins living in the Sentinels but turning their attention east ([[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]] could be starting to become a player in the eastern edges of the forests) (possibly there are skirmishers with Myraeni people). 
- Mawar hiding in the fog
- Chardon greatly weakened, and falling back to its core hinterlands. 
- Remnants of NR 1 and NR 5 maintaining fortifications and defenses against the "Central branch evil realm"; unclear to what extent this is an active war and for how long it is an active war vs a sporadic war. 
- Apporia under Illorian control, part of the pirate kingdom of [[Chirce]]
- Yeraad river cultures mostly being insular and laying low

### Retrenchment

**DR 1560 - DR 1597**




![[Chardon-expansion-BloodYears.jpg]]

The rough model here is that you have two waves of advances from the north. The dragon conclave and allies (in red), who sweep through the northern kingdoms (in yellow on map above), the elves, and advance down the Chasa until they are defeated outside Chardon. The timeline on the map isn't necessarily accurate. 

The consequence of this advance is mostly destruction: the northern kingdoms are entirely wiped out, especially 2, 3, and 4 in yellow on first map. Refugees flee west and south (1 and 5 on the first map).

The second advance (probably hobgoblins) is more methodical and aims to conquer territory, not wipe out people. This advance is stopped north of Chardon, but for some time (not clear exactly how long), Chardon doesn't have the resources to march north. 

Then, at some point, the Chardon Empire begins to grow. Probably the motivation here is the realization that this is why Drankor had an empire, because sometimes dragons show up to kill you and you need an empire to keep people alive. 
- With the dragon conclave defeated, the Chasa river valley is resettled and rebuilt, essentially becoming the first part of the Chardonian Empire
- Over some years? a generation? longer? Chardon drives north, slowly freeing the people of the coast ruled by hobgoblins and incorporating them into the empire (timing of this should be checked against Mawar fog timing)
- at this stage, the Chardonian Empire is Chasa + agricultural coast, probably at least the southern and western coastline of Lake Valandros.
- this is stable for a while, but then someone discovers chalyte in the mountains near Voltara, and Chardon moves north to control the chalyte mines. 
- left unclear is the Yeraad river valley

So in 1749 (putting aside Yeraad river valley):
- Chardon and the Chasa watershed are the most distinctly Chardonian in some sense
- the north agricultural coast and the western/southern shores of Lake Valandros probably has largely the same people living there since forever, who have seen their rulers change from minor princes pre-Great-War to hobgoblins to the Chardonian Empire; they largely would likely see the Chardonian Empire in a very positive light
- the north is more complicated
	- the Chardonian Empire definitely rules the north shore of Lake Valandros now, but this might be a bit more fraught; many of these people are the descendants of the yellow kingdoms in first map, and are less likely to be well integrated into the empire
	- north of where the river splits, the plains are probably not densely settled; Chardon maintains a number of garrisons to protect chalyte caravans heading south but the area especially "between the rivers" is probably not under particularly solid political control.
	- Voltara itself is fortified and relatively new; the plains around it are dangerous to the north and east, relatively safe to the south and west due to Chardonian garrisons. 
	- towards the coast, it is not clear that the Chardonian Empire controls the coastline either around the Tawir forest, or south/west of the Voltara mountains. these are probably instead still the remnants of the old "yellow kingdoms"
