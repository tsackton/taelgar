# Magic in Taelgar

%% ots of stuff still to flesh out:
- impact of rare high level spells
- non-clerics
- magic items (both common and rare)
- other species - especially dwarves and elves with reliable access to cantrips across much of the population
%%

This note collects background information about magic in Taelgar, particularly as it impacts society, to aid worldbuilding. 


See: [[Magic in Taelgar - Open Questions]] for some discussion and unresolved points. 

## A Few Basic Truths

Starting with a few basic observations about the world that should be maintained. 

1. The most fundamental observation is that all magic in Taelgar is the result of the manipulation of extraplanar power. 
2. Most magic comes from the various gods and divinities of Taelgar. This is by far the easiest magic to learn, the most common magic, and the most reliable magic. 
	1. For humans, this means that divine magic users are far more common than arcane or primal magic users among the population
	2. For Firstborn races, this means that whatever manifestations of magic that their Embodied Gods provide are far more common than anything else.
3. Arcane magic comes from learning to manipulate extraplanar energy, which leaks into Taelgar in various ways. This has relatively little implications for spellcasting, but is an important lore fact.
4. Primal magic is not well defined and maybe does not need to exist as a lore category, as opposed to a mechanical category. However, this feels a little unsatisfying as there is clearly something a little different about the vibes of druids and rangers. This might wait until a player interested in worldbuilding plays a druid. 
5. The ability to use magic is much more common, for whatever reason, among individuals driven to adventure, as heroes or villains, than among those who settle. This does not currently have any satisfying in-game explanation, but is necessary to allow satisfying high-level adventures to exist with humanoid allies and enemies.
## How Common is Magic?

Considering general spellcasting ability, common magic items, rare magic items, and high level spells separately. 

### General Spellcasting Ability

A good rule of thumb is that roughly 1 in 1000 people has some kind of magical talent. This suggests that generally a spellcaster is available in most larger market towns, but only 1 in 10 or even 1 in 20 small villages will have a spellcaster. Most people will probably know a spellcaster second or third-hand; almost everyone would at least know someone who has seen magic performed. 

In standard human populations, a safe assumption would be that at least 60% of spellcasters are divine magic users, mostly clerics, although there is presumably some regional variation, and arcane spellcasters in particular may be likely to aggregate in much higher density around major centers of learning. Non-divine spellcasters are likely roughly equally divided between primal and arcane casters. 

In a typical heavily settled agricultural region with about 10,000 people scattered between a market town and numerous small villages, one might expect to find 6-7 divine magic users (mostly/entirely clerics), 1-2 arcane magic users (mostly wizards or bards), and 1-2 primal magic users (druids or rangers).

### Spell Levels

Among the magic-using, non-adventuring population, only about 20%-30% of spellcasters ever learn, or are even capable of learning, to cast anything more powerful than a 1st level spell, and generally less than 5% of non-adventuring spellcasters ever achieve the power to cast 3rd level or higher spells. 

This implies that even in a large city of 100,000 people, there are probably only 4-6 people who can cast 3rd level spells or higher, and it is likely that 2-3 of them are clerics. 

Magic higher than 3rd level would be exceptionally rare and require a special effort to track down. 

The general implications are probably as follows:
#### Clerics

6. The spells that have the greatest effect on worldbuilding are cleric cantrips, and to a lesser extent 1st level cleric spells. Considering only non-damage, non-combat spells, and picking a few key ones...
	1. Guidance: while this does not have a major effect on worldbuilding, it can be used to flavor effective prayers being fairly common
	2. Light: with only an hour duration, and only one existing at a time, doesn't really substitute for electricity or oil lamps, but for example temples might often  be lit by magic after dark. 
	3. Mending: the biggest impact on worldbuilding. if mending is generally available in most market towns, things last longer in general, and temples/religions could use as a source of funds e.g, a market stall to fix things in exchange for a small donation.
	4. Create or Destroy Water: this would be very effective for firefighting, and might help explain why towns don't burn down as frequently as they did historically; but it doesn't create enough water to sustain a population in the absence of a non-magical water source, or prevent a drought from destroying crops
	5. Cure Wounds, Healing Word: in my opinion, the major worldbuilding implication here is we can assume childbirth is very safe, or at least if there are complications as long as you get a cleric you can save the child or the mother or both fairly easily. this can also be used for things like setting broken bones, healing damage from minor injuries, etc. generally use the ready availablity of cure wounds as a substitute for modern medicine to give the world a more modern demographic flavor (childbirth is not super-dangerous, child mortality is not super high)
	6. Purify Food and Drink, Detect Poison and Disease: major use would be stopping water-borne disease. the cleric blesses the well and people stop getting sick; Detect Poison and Disease can trace the source of outbreaks. 
7. At 2nd level, you get a few addiitonal worldbuilding implications, primarily for large cities where 2nd level casters are more common
	1. Augury: mostly for flavor, but people asking the local priest for advice would not be too atypical; only works 1/day per cleric though
	2. Continual Flame: despite the costly material components, would be extremely valuable for producing lanterns in big cities, and in many cases streets should be lit at night not by oil lamps but by continual flame lamps (however, theft might be a problem). Permanent lanterns would be a thing but an expensive, luxury item. Because of the cost and the risk of theft, the biggest use is probably in things like libraries and archives where you have a lot of flammable material. 
	3. Enhance Ability, Locate Object: mostly flavor, really, but you would have prayers of finding and other kinds of prayers 
	4. Lesser Restoration: major impact on disease; although you can only cure a few people per day, and so can't stop a massive outbreak, this can make disease burden much closer to modern day than to typical medieval conditions
	5. Zone of Truth: in some places, this may be common enough to be part of criminal proceedings, especially in places like Dunmar where priests are judges
8. At 3rd level, spells start to really scale in power, with things like Sending, Speak with Dead, Create Food and Water, Clairvoyance, Tongues having potentially major impacts on the world. But in general, these are rare enough that while accessible they aren't common enough to majorly affect worldbuliding - these are just there for things like the population of city X survived a siege longer than expected by supplementing their supplies with Create Food and Water. Sending probably affects politics a bit as most rulers likely have a spellcaster capable of a few Sendings per day. So news can travel faster than in real medieval models, although Sending is limited enough this can create confusion and problems as well.

# Player’s Overview of Magic

## Overview

Taelgar is a world rich in magic. While it comes in many flavors, fundamentally all magic in Taelgar arises from extra-planar energy flowing into Taelgar. However, within this broad definition, many flavors of magic exist. 

### Racial Magic

The Elder races have their own racial magics that draw power from their connections to the Embodied Gods that created them. While the exact nature of these racial magics is not always widely known, rumors abound of elves manipulating the essence of magic itself, of dwarves and their runes of power, of lizardfolk and their connection to the [[Dreamworld]] and the spirits of their ancestors, of halfling telepathy, of stoneborn able to change their bodies and strengthen there minds. 

  

The other races, such as the Children of Ahra and Malik, the descendants of the elder elementals, the titans, the great wyrms, and the archfey, have their own kinds of racial magic, although these are little understood by human scholars.

### Divine Magic

The gods -- whether the embodied gods, or the incorporeal gods of humanity -- are able to grant miracles, to manifest the magic of the Divine in the world of Taelgar, through the prayers of their followers. This is the magic of clerics and paladins. 

### Primal Magic

The echo realms, the parts of the multiverse created when the Age of Creation ended and some of the strength of magic was drawn out of the material plane, still resonate deeply with the material plane itself. Some magic users learn to draw energy from these resonances. This is the magic of druids and rangers, who draw on the magical resonances within the natural world itself.

### Arcane Magic

Other magic users draw energy from the wild chaos of the Plane of Magic itself, which intersects with Taelgar at connections known as ley lines. This arcane magic can be learned, via study and practice; this is the magic of wizards and many bards. Or, it can be innate, as is the case for some sorcerers.

### Other Magic

Rumors abound of magical energy drawn from the [[Plane of Souls|Plane of Consciousness]], sometimes called the [[Plane of Souls]], power that can be used to manipulate the world with mental force alone. The ki of monks, for example, represents this kind of power. 

  

Other magic users exist as well, such as warlocks, those who have made pacts with powerful entities and thus can channel the power of these powerful entities. Ultimately, all magic is just the application of extraplanar energy. So anything that can channel extraplanar energy can create magic. 

# DM Guide

## Modification of Magic

Magic in Taelgar can be made stronger, or weaker, by many things. Often, these are aspects of the world that lead to weaker, or stronger, connections between the other planes and the material planes. Other times, these may be ancient relics or pieces of the world still holding on to the energies of creation.


### Primal Presence

The magical resonances of the echo realms and their reflections in Taelgar is the ultimate source of magical power for druids, rangers, and some warlocks and sorcerers. These casters draw on the energy of the world itself, the magic that is reflected from Taelgar into the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the other echo realms. 

Like ley lines, there are thin spots in the world where one or more echo realms are closer to Taelgar, where the boundary between places is more tenuous. These often function as portals between worlds, but can also affect magic that draws power from the echo realms in ways that are similar, albeit more unpredictable, to the way that ley lines affect the magic of the Plane of Magic.

### Chalyte

- Magical gemstone, possibly relic of Age of Creation, and/or formed from ore and other geological processes that interact with ley lines
    
- Can fuel spell effects, particularly arcane magic, and power magic items
    
- Addictive to use and chalyte users often come to slowly rely on it
    
- If used frequently can cause long term problems
    
- Often used to power and charge magic items as a safer alternative
    

## Racial Magic 

The Elder races have unique access to special racial magic, via their connections to the Embodied Gods that created them. 

  

- Elves -> 'true magic', everyday cantrips + powerful rituals
    
- Stoneborn -> modify self
    
- Lizardfolk -> commune with spirits, prophecy
    
- Dwarves -> rune magic
    
- Halflings -> telepathy
