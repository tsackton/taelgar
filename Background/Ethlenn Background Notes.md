### Ethlenn and Umbraeth

Umbraeth was originally a powerful courtier in Ethlenn's court - probably an archfey, but a weaker one. His nature is chaotic and deceitful, but he loved the glimmer and elegance of Twilight's Grace.

However, at some point in the 600s DR he violated Ethlenn's rules against tricking the mortals of Tyrwingha, and was exiled to Duskmire, at the time just a small realm over the Darkwood.

He was banished to never be able to cross the Sunset Gate, outside his own realm, nor to enter Twilight's Grace, and in exchange, Ethlenn agreed to stay her hand and not kill him.

When Cloudspinner fell, he expanded his domain substantially, but he cannot cross the Sunset Gate.

In part, Ethlenn has wanted Umbraeth to have minimal interactions with mortals, and Duskmire was traditionally centered around the Darkwood and other places where fey are feared and avoided. Umbraeth has expanded north especially since the fall of [[Sharpspire]] and is extremely interested in gaining reliable access to Taelgar.

Rumors that Umbraeth is somehow related to Ethlenn do exist, but are false. See [[Stories of Tyrwingha for Profit]].


%%^Campaign:none%%
A fey gate in Cleenseau Wood is currently the focus of his efforts. Additionally, there is significant in world hints that Ethlenn has a special ability with fey gates and stabilizing fey gates. In particular Umbraeth believes, correctly, that those people especially under Ethlenn's protection have a resonance with fey portals (metaphysics unclear). Umbraeth has created some type of magic that sees this resonance, and had been kidnapping people who had faint versions of this. He is now focused on Elaine II, who he believes has a very strong resonance.
