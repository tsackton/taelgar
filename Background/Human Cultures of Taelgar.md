This background document defines a typology of human cultures, where the blank spaces are, and some major trends.  See [[Historical Framework]] for more background,  [[Human Cultures - Discussions]] for meta, and [[Human Cultures - Open Questions]] for open questions.
# Cultural Origins

All human cultures originated with migrations from Hkar, in either one of the four major cultural migrations, or one of potentially many smaller cultural migrations. 
### Major Migrations
See [[Historical Framework#Migrations and Emigration]] for dates.

1. The **Northern Migrations**. These are small gods/intercessory religions that left Hkar before the development of an urban civilization using significant arcane magic. These migrants settled first on the west coast (although without a defined specific location) and spread along the west coast before crossing the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] in the far north and spreading east. Northerner cultures should generally not have a pantheonic religion, and arcane magic should be comparatively rare amongst them. These migrants -- for undetermined reasons -- have minimal contact with [[Hkar]] after their departure. 
2. The **Southern Migrations**. These occur after the beginning of the development of pantheonic religion on Hkar, but otherwise, nothing is known about this migration. It could be one, or several, different pantheonic cultures, and it could have had significant contact with Hkar, or none. 
3. The **Mariner Migration**. This is a unified migration worshipping a pantheon of gods (but that is not [[Mos Numena]]) which sails west (or south) from [[Hkar]] and settles in the [[Eastern Green Sea]] before spreading back west towards [[Greater Sembara]]. This migration may have been in opposition to the increasing urbanization of Hkar, but the exact reasons for this migration are not clear. 
4. The **Downfall Refugees**. After the sinking of Hkar, refugees flee canonically to Drankor, and potentially to other places as well. These refugees share a highly urban magical culture and worship [[Mos Numena]].  Often referred to as Drankorians, but technically there could be several different refugee groups beyond the Drankorians.  %% Note: Mos Numena as the only religion here is not canonical %%
### Minor Migrations
Although the northerner migrations are canonically the first migrations from Hkar, any number of minor migrations can fit into the framework. These migrations could have occurred as early as concurrently with the northerner migrations and as late as the runup to the Downfall War. The only common fact about these minor migrations is that they would generally be expected to be small and culturally cohesive. 

Canonical minor migrations are listed below:

1. The **Dunmari** migration, originally settled in 
### Schisms and Blendings
The originally migrations from Hkar were all at least 1700 years ago, and some as long as 3000 years ago. This is substanial time for cultures to split, blend, and otherwise change. The canonical areas of mixing and blending are:

1. The **Eastern Schisms**. The mariner culture had at least two, and perhaps several more major schisms (cultural and religious) as it spread from the [[~Eastern Islands~]] to the [[Western Gulf]]. Each of these schisms produced the possibility of cultural change.
2. The **Sembaran Mixing Pot**. In the Sembaran region the "mariner", "northerner", and "Downfall Refugee" cultures all interacted in a complex way.
3. The **West Coast Mixing Pot**. Along the west coast, there was significant time for cultural development before the arrival of the Drankorian Empire, and the region was only partially conquered by Drankor. 

There are of course likely numerous other places where cultural groups mixed, they have just not been well-defined.
# Existing Cultures

This lists existing cultures and potential derivations, as well as some information as to how canonical those derivations are.

_Note: Areas that are not listed at all below -- i.e. that are listed neither as having an explicit culture nor has being intentionally blank are in general assumed to simply not have humans, but of course it is possible that some human culture is lurking in the wilds, unbeknowst to anyone_
## Northern
Across the northern reaches of Taelgar -- from the [[~North Bay~]] to the northern parts of [[Ainumarya]], across the northern [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], through [[Zimkova]], the upper [[Volta]], the northern parts of [[Vostok]], the [[Svinjo Mountains]], and the vast [[~Northern Boreal Forest~]]  live a potentially large variety of cultures. These cultures are all, in general, from the **Northern** migrations, and share a variety of [[Northern Folk Religions]]. This is marginal land, and has never been conquered by larger empires.

Cultures in this region could plausibly be: Northern offshoots or unique minor migrations. This area was never penetrated by Drankor, and is far from both the Southern and Eastern migrations, and thus would require compelling reason to have cultures derived from those migrations here.

See [[~Northerner~]] for more background on this cultural region.

Defined cultures in this region include:
* The [[Deno'qai]], a pure northerner culture, who [[Tanshi Worship|worship the tanshi]]
* The [[Zimka]], who are really two cultures with a shared identity: an older, pure northerner strand, the [[~Old Zimka~]] , [[Kestavo|worshippers of the kestavo]], and a newer strand, heavily influenced by the "Sembaran mixing pot", who might be as likely to worship [[Mos Numena]] as the [[Kestavo]]
* The [[Vargaldi]], a pure northerner culture, who [[Zariya|worship the zariya]]

There is certainly humans in the northern part of [[Vostok]], but whether they are essentially another strand of [[Zimka]], closely connected to the southern Vos, or a unique culture is not clear.

Outside of the northwest coast and the area around the [[~North Bay~]] (which is explicitly blank), and the area north of [[Vostok]], this region could support additional cultures as needed. 
## West Coast
A number of cultures exist along the [[West Coast Region]], ranging from the [[Nevos Sea]] in the south to the [[Erbalta Plains]] in the north, including:
### Mawar
The [[Mawakel Peninsula]] is home to a unique people worshipping their own version of [[Mos Numena]] and with their own unique language. The cultural derivation of these people is not clear, although many other documents assume Northern/Drankorian blend. Other possibilities could work, including a second set of Downfall Refugees or a intermixing of a unique pantheonic culture with Drankorian culture.
### Chardon
The **[[Chardonian Empire|Chardonian]]** culture is a mostly purely Drankorian/Downfall Refugee derived culture, although with the possibility of some northern influence. [[Mos Numena]] is worshipped across the Chardonian region, although with some differences from [[Sembara|Sembaran]] Mos Numena.
### North-Coastal Apporia
The northern coasts of the  [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] has a unique culture, of a pure Drankorian/Downfall Refugee derivation, worshipping [[Mos Numena]]. In the modern day this has come under the broad influence of Chardon but presumably retains some cultural differences.
### Northern Realms
In general, the areas north and east of Chardon, including especially the [[~North Chardon Coast~]], [[Lake Valandros]] and [[Voltara]], share a common cultural history, which includes:
* Descent from the earlier northern migrations
* Conquest or at least significant influence by Drankor during the [[Historical Framework#Western Expansion]] 
* Devastation by Cha'mutte, or his armies, during the Great War and Blood Years
* Worship, since the conquest by Drankor, of [[Mos Numena]]

This area is relatively poorly defined compared to some areas, and although these northern realms cultures are canonical, the details are expected to vary as a firmer history and cultural context is developed. There may be some distinct cultural differences between the southern northern realms and the northern northern realms. There is potentially space in this cultural region for another Northern culture, especially a destroyed one, although it is likely a better fit to just expand the [[Deno'qai]] -- already a potentially rather varied group -- as needed.
### Illoria and Nevos
The islands of the Nevos Sea were conquered by Drankor and at least partially converted to Mos Numena, but never fully integrated into the empire. Illoria has always been a melting pot, and the people of the islands were historically a mix of Northerners and probably some later Hkaran migrants, so even before the downfall this was a blended place. In current day also includes people with Dunmari ancestry, some "northern realms culture" refugees, Drankorian refugees, some of everybody. Probably one of the most religiously diverse places on the mainland. The derivation of this culture is meant to be very open, and could include almost anything.

Note that the exact extent of this cultural region is unclear, and it may include the Emerald Bay coastline of [[Apporia]]. The north-coastal parts of [[Apporia]] are also related to this culture, but in the modern day have been much more heavily influenced by Chardon.
### Undefined Cultural Areas
A number of areas in the West Coast are explicitly left open, and may or may not have humans at all. These include:
* The Emerald Bay, interior and western coast of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]]. (Although perhaps the Emerald Bay is part of the Illorian culture)
* The [[~North Bay~]]
* Anything north of [[Voltara]]
* The [[~Sayuna Islands~]]  (which may not even exist, but if they do, almost certainly have people)

## Sentinels
The [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] divide the continent in two, and in general, are the domain of [[Dwarves]] and [[Stoneborn]]. The human cultures that do thrive in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and their foothills are mostly defined in the [[#Northern]] section. 
## Dunmari Basin

### Dunmari
The [[Dunmar|Dunmari]] culture dominates this region, and are effectively the only humans between the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], the [[Myraeni Gap]], and the [[Desolation of Cha'mutte]]. Although there are some different cultural strands within the Dunmari culture, between the more traditional east and the more sedentary west, at least in 1750 the Dunmari are still a single unified culture.

The Dunmari originated as a unique migration from Hkar, originally to a homeland in the far east. In the years immediately after the fall of Drankor, they travelled west, and somewhere in the [[Istaros Watershed]], split into two groups. One, who continued west, became the modern Dunmari. The other group did not continue west, and presumably returned to their original homeland, although this is not strictly canonical - perhaps they died in the [[~Great Desert~]] or ended up somewhere in the far south or east. 

%% Tim is the above correct? %%
##### Historical Note
The historical cultures that existed in the [[Dunmari Basin]]  have largely vanished, between the upheavals of the [[First Plague]] and the [[Great War]], and are not currently defined. 
## Istaros Watershed
Although the [[Istaros Watershed]] is today mostly a desolate [[Plaguelands]], some important cultural trends emerged from the Istaros, or have developed on the borders.
### Aurbez
The people of the [[Aurbez and the Andonne]] are broadly descended from a mix of new settlers from [[Sembara]] and [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] and [[Isingue|Isinguese]] refugees. A unique culture is forming here, as is potentially a language, but as of 1750 DR this is still a broadly Sembaran culture.
### Maseau
The people of [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] were mostly new settlers in the wake of the defeat of the [[Dominion of Avatus]], largely from [[Sembara]].  Close cultural connections have broadly kept language and culture from diverging. 
### Isingue
The Isinguese culture is a purely Drankorian culture. Originally a Drankorian province, it gained a unique culturally identity after the Fall of Drankor. During the Great War, Isingue was destroyed but the culture and language survive in a diaspora. 
## Western Green Sea

### Skaer

### Tollish

### Vos

### Sembaran

### Tyrwinghan

### Addermanian
Addermarch, although a somewhat unique place, does not have a strongly distinct culture, and is best thought of as part of the broader [[Sembara|Sembaran]] culture, although with significant influence from [[Tyrwingha]].
### Cymean

### ~South Cymean~

%% TODO: This is the area that is probably most in need of working out %%
### Intentionally Blank

## Eastern Green Sea
Although there are likely human cultures spread throughout the Eastern Green Sea, in the [[~Far North Peninsula~]], the [[~Eastern Coast~]]
### Ursk
See [[Ursk]]
### Medju
See [[Medju]]
### ~Mariner Trade Peninsula~
This area could use some invention, even if it is to decide to should be intentionally blank
### Irrla
### Intentionally Blank

## South and East
The Far South and the Far East -- everything west of the Drankorian borders and south of the Green Sea -- is explicitly left blank. There are (almost) certainly humans here, but the details are intentionally not canonical.

The only canonical culture in this region is the original proto-Dunmari.
