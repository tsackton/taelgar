**WARNING: THIS DOCUMENT IS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED FULLY CANONICAL**

This note tries to draw together various strands of worldbuilding related to religious history into a cohesive outline. 

The starting point here is drawing from the fundamental metaphysics of humanity: they are created by the high gods, [[Divine Presence|Arhat]] and [[Divine Presence|Malik]], and imbued with the divine spark that lets their belief shape and create divinity from the magical essence of spiritual planes / the creator gods / whatever mysterious force is the cause of divine magic in the world. However, the creator gods themselves are very much not active in the world: while they are the source, ultimately, of divine magic, they do not answer prayers or grant miracles. Let undecided is whether this is because they cannot or because they do not want to or for some other reason; at some point will need to work this out in the context of the "high god religion".

## Non-humans

First, a brief note about non-humans, who tend to have a simpler religious history. The creations of Embodied Gods (orcs, elves, dwarves/gnomes, halfling, lizardfolk, stoneborn) generally have super-static religions. Their creator gods exist in a much more permanent and constrained form than human gods, having an independent existence and independent connection to Divine magic. So while religious traditions might shift a bit over time, it isn't like there are new religions or major changes in religious practice/belief. 

The goblinoid species were explicitly created as anti-humans, in a sense, and have no (native) gods or religions. 

Other species are somewhat up in the air and left undeveloped at the moment. Generally the creations of the Children of the Divine (fey, dragons, elementals, giants) look to their ancient mythic ancestors as their creators and gods, but what exactly the true relationship here is is left undetermined. The great wyrms, archfey, titans, and elder elementals are metaphysically similar to embodied gods (created by [[Divine Presence|Arhat]] and [[Divine Presence|Malik]]) but conceptually distinct and whether they can, for example, grant divine miracles to their descendants is currently undetermined. Unique species (kenku, centaurs, merfolk) have various degrees of lore but nothing super-canonical (is Aerin actually an Embodied God now?).

## Humans on Hkar

Humans are created and gifted Hkar as their ancestral homeland, free of the influence of the Elder Folk. The divine spark is strong in early generations of humans, and quickly an early proto-religion develops on Hkar, focused on personal deities. 
### Era of Personal Deities

The first religious tradition, such as it is, that develops on Hkar is based around the power of individuals, strong in belief, to create personal divine protectors for themselves. Arcane and primal magic have not yet been discovered by humans, and so a great deal of power accrues to those who are able to will into being strong personal deities. 

In the very earliest days, these are something like divine familiars. These early deities have three key features relevant to later religious history:

- While individually weak, they are a conduit for divine magic and for channeling the miracles of [[Divine Presence|Arhat]] and [[Divine Presence|Malik]] to the material plane. This is functionally an early kind of intercessory prayer.
- They are physically manifest on the material plane, and only exist on the material plane while the person who manifest them is alive. After death, they accompany the soul of their "creator" through the land of the dead to whatever is beyond, protecting them during the journey. It is possible that some of these early deities become the rulers of the primordial outer planes, places like Nine Hells, Abyss, Arborea, etc, that aren't associated with a particular divinity. This is both the source of many of the primordial outer planes that may exist as needed / invented, and the origin of the belief common in e.g. the northern folk religions that the small gods protect the soul on the journey through the land of the dead.
- They have no ability to reach the material plane once they have left it, and often simply dissipate and vanish on the death of their "creator". This is the source of many traditions that still persist in northern folk religions around ensuring that the small gods can find the soul of the deceased and helping the soul of the deceased make the transition to the land of the dead. This is also potentially the reason why creatures like demons and devils have to be physically present on the material plane to influence events. 

So in the early days of humanity, you don't really have religion in a real sense, at least not organized religion. But probably everyone is thought to have a personal deity, even if some people are not strong-willed enough to summon divine miracles. In some senses this probably resembles "modern day" arcane or primal magic, where you have some powerful individually strong casters who have the right force of personality / strength of mind / whatever to effectively challenge miracles through their personal deities. But in many cases, these personal deities probably don't even have a name, and they aren't really conceived of as having an independent existence from their "person". This might in some ways be kind of like daemons in the Phillip Pullman books, if there was vastly more variability in power levels (most people would probably not be able to physically manifest their deities).
### The Era of Cults

At some point, a charismatic leader first realizes that they get stronger if other people pray to their personal deity, and this leads to the spread of religious cults. Deities are still conceived of as personal deities, the "strength of spirit" of a particular person, but now you have some leaders who convince others to worship their personal deity. These are still seen as personal gods, and are not worshipped after the death of their creator, and so never grow to have continuing influence. But, you start to get the idea of gods beyond the personal protective spirit that is your own personal deity develop. 

### The Era of Small Gods

In a variety of ways, the era of cults quickly becomes an era of small gods. It likely starts with ancestor worship - if your mother was a powerful divine sorcerer, and you benefitted from her personal deity in life, it would be very natural to continue praying to her personal deity in death. 

Conceptually, all gods are still thought of as local and as existing primarily as manifestations of divine power on the material plane, with some kind of focal point (a person, a family, a place). Metaphysically, not a lot has changed from the era of personal deities, but there are a few notable shifts:

- In this era, the idea of religious rituals develops. Because the gods that exist are small and local, a lot of rituals exist to ensure they can hear you and pay attention to you. This is in many ways a more formal development of intercessory prayer and becomes a major influence for the northern folk religions. The idea is that, in order to carry a prayer to the Divine, the spirit needs to hear the prayer, and no spirit is powerful enough to hear all prayers. 
- This influences funerary rites as well. The old idea that your personal spirit protects you in the land of the dead continues, but increasingly rituals originally conceived as a way to ensure the soul and the personal deity transition to the land of the dead together turn into rituals designed to ensure the appropriate small god (who will protect the soul on its journey beyond) can actually find the soul in the material world. 
- Conceptually, it is in this era that the idea of deities with identities separate from individual people develops, but metaphysically deities are still conceived of as small, local spirits, in many ways not much different than the personal divinities of early humanity. 
- Metaphysically, this is probably largely correct at this time. 

For much of this era, there is probably a certain degree of religious stasis. While their may be a lot of variety of different kinds of small gods, and specific local variants on how you attract their attention, the fundamental picture small intercessory gods that need to be summoned to you to carry your prayers is pretty stable. 

It is during this time that the first humans leave Hkar, and begin to explore the mainland, coming into contact with elder folk. This contact leads to a number of major upheavals in human culture, including the introduction of non-divine magic, and the introduction of new conceptions of what divinity can be. 

#### Northern Folk Religions

The various northern folk religious traditions -- [[Tanshi Worship]] and the [[Kestavo]] most prominently, but also whatever other religions might derive from the early northerner migrations -- grow out of this era of small gods, and share a few key features from this history:

- The conception of gods in these religious traditions is personal and local. Gods, conceptually, are manifestations on the material plane of a divine essence, but are not omnipresent. If you want something from them, you need to draw their attention, with the right rituals, sacrifices, prayers, etc. In the tanshi tradition, this is primarily via sacrifices; in the kestavan tradition, this is by going to the place where the kestavo spirit dwells. But both traditions - and all other northern folk religions - share the basic framework that deities are not omnipresent.
- This also affects funerary traditions, because it is crucial to make sure that a deity is there, to guide your soul into the land of the dead and protect it on its journey. You can't assume that a god will just happen to see you die and come help. 
- There is also a fundamental assumption / metaphysical truth that the small gods themselves are primarily messengers / conduits, and only have power via their ability to intercede with the High Gods. 
- There is a metaphysical sense in which these small gods actually exist in the material plane. They have physical form, and they can, theoretically, be killed or destroyed.
- These gods do not exist in a spiritual realm and your soul does not go join the gods in death. I think conceptually there is little understanding among the practitioners of the northern folk religions about what is beyond the land of the dead, and this is left uncertain. But people in these cultures would not speak of the dead as being with the gods. The souls of the dead pass on to another place, and would be described as being beyond the veil or passed into the beyond or something. 
- Generally speaking, the answer to why a specific miracle is not granted tends to "the gods did not hear it" rather than "the gods have limited power," since it is assumed that [[Divine Presence|Arhat]] and [[Divine Presence|Malik]], who are actually granting miracles, have infinite power (but, of course, there is also the secondary effect of asking for more than one limited spirit can channel).

### Early Pantheonic Religions

After contact with the Elder Folk, human culture on Hkar enters a period of rapid change. Arcane magic spreads quickly, you start to get rapid urbanization, the establishment of Hkaran colonies (this is potentially the "Southerners"), a lot of cultural diversification and the beginnings of what will become the urban/mariner divide. 

Conceptually, you get the first development of the idea of omnipresent deities who have their own independent spiritual domains beyond the veil of the Land of the Dead. Potentially, this is basically just stolen from the Elder Folk and is a human conception of the Embodied Gods. Metaphysically, this is a massive shift and leads to a number of important developments in religious history. 

%%See: [[Discord Chat - Homes of Incorporeal Gods]] for some discussion / possible revision on this point %%

- While the nature of the divine spark remains ineffable, the belief in the possibility of human spiritual realms, at some level, acts to make them possible. Whether created out of divine energy directly, or transformed from something else, no one knows. 
- The nature of divinity that inhabits a spiritual realm is fundamentally different from a deity that inhabits the material plane. These deities are in many ways naturally omnipresent, and are limited only by the effort of channeling divine magic from the spiritual realms to the material plane.
- The existence of omnipresent divinities leads to the possibility of belief feedback loops, where some deities grow stronger and stronger as they attract more worshippers, and others fade away. This also leads to a change in religious traditions, beginning to shift from a focus on drawing the attention of the deity to a focus on praise/thanks to the deities themselves. 

From the point of view of religious history, this is a time of rapid change. Many religions probably rise and fall in this time, and many gods are born and die. There is a lot of diversity in conceptions of deities. Major developed religions that grew out of this time include the [[Five Siblings|Dunmari faith]] and the Skaer worship of [[Kaikkea]]. Religions that grow from this era probably share less with each other than religions from earlier or later eras, as there is a lot of diversity here. However, a few things to keep in mind:

- This is a time when the conception of deities is rapidly changing. However, most religions that grow from this era generally share a conception of deities as powerful extraplanar entities that dwell in spiritual realms, but the specific relationships with humans are very diverse. These range from idea idea of a divine family (among the Dunmari), the idea of a single creator god (Kaikkea of the Skaer), and many others. 
- A common feature of religions from this era is a focus on belief as what creates divine power; whatever other diverse religious rituals may exist, there are almost always some kind of prayers or traditions around thanksgiving. This is also when the concept of intercessory prayer begins to fall out of favor, as it is perceived that powerful deities with their own extraplanar realms can grant miracles independently of [[Divine Presence|Arhat]] and [[Divine Presence|Malik]]. 
- Religious traditions from this era have diverse explanations for why every miracle is not granted, that blend different elements of "limited power" and "didn't hear you." Metaphysically, most of the deities of this era are probably not truly omnipresent, although they certainly have a wider presence on the material plane that the small gods of earlier eras. 
- Funerary traditions from this era are diverse, with varying emphasis on which parts of the process require the most human/prayer aid and which parts the deities handle. 

[[Sarqon]], and the events discussed in the [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Binding Stones]], probably happen during this era, but may happen in the small gods era. The mariner exodus is the tail end of this era.

### Late Pantheonic Religion

(this is probably the part I'm least certain about, although everything is brainstorming)

Over time, as the eastern urban culture spreads on Hkar, a process of consolidation begins to take hold. Within the eastern urban culture, the scientific study of magic is highly regarded, and while, again, the divine spark cannot be dissected, there is a growing understanding that the more followers a deity has, the more powerful they are. In particular, while exactly what limits the flow of magic from the divine realm to the material plane is never clearly understood, there is a growing belief that the "bigger" a religion, the more functionally omnipresent the deities of that religion are. 

This leads to a process where, as the urban magical culture spreads, there begins to be an assignment of similar deities from different pantheons to the same archetypes (the analogy is something like Roman appropriation of various diverse gods here, although without conquest in the case of Hkar). 

The religions that grow out of this period might be called archetypal religions. Currently only one exists, Mos Numena, and there probably shouldn't be many, but there is potentially room from a second somewhere among the Southerners? If ever desired. These are the common features:

- While in the early pantheonic days, pantheons were often conceived of as sharing a spiritual realm, and were not necessarily perceived as omnipresent, the archetypal gods are thought to be powerful enough to control their own spiritual domain, and to be omnipresent everwhere (although still limited by the flow of magic from the spiritual realms to the material plane). 
- Deities, in this conception, are rarely thought of as actual physical beings that you could meet. Instead, they have avatars and aspects; among theologians of an archetypal religion it might be assumed that gods of other pantheonic religions are, in fact, avatars of specific archetypes. Whether this is metaphysically true is not clear. 
- Funerary traditions now focus almost entirely on ensuring the safety of the soul as it crossed the land of the dead. Omnipresent deities have no need of prayers to draw their attention to a wandering soul, so the focus is entirely on bolstering the power of the divine to act on this side of the veil (metaphysically the land of the dead is on the material plane side of the divine veil or whatever it is that limits the power of miracles).

## Humans outside Hkar

Three major events shape current-day religion on the mainland: the diversification of the northern folk religions, the mariner schisms, and secondary contact between Mos Numena and other traditions as the Drankorian Empire grows. 

### Northern Folk Religion Diversification

The first emigrants from Hkar spread slowly and at relatively low population densities through the west coast, and then across the Sentinels, and further east into the vast northern boreal forests. During this time, a variety of northern cultures develop, with variations of the basic religious tradition of small gods. Most developed are the Deno'qai, with their tanshi, and the Zimka, with their kestavo, but others exist.

### Mariner Schisms

The mariner culture, broadly speaking, left Hkar during the height of the early pantheonic era, and brought a variety of religious traditions to the Green Sea, where they settled and spread. A variety of religious schisms (at least one, possibly more) divided these people as they spread. Details are currently largely undeveloped, except for:

- One strand of mariner belief eventually becomes the Skaer religion, which is canonically a monotheistic religion centered around the worship of Kaikeea, the mother ocean. Kaikkea is likely an ancient goddess and the Skaer are particularly strong in divine magic. Potentially, Kaikkea is the only divinity surviving from a larger pantheon.
- One strand of mariner belief is the undeveloped neo-Eastern religion that focuses on direct worship of [[Divine Presence|Arhat]] and [[Divine Presence|Malik]]. 

Other diverse traditions may have come out of the various mariner schisms, in places like the "mariner trade peninsula" and Medju and the general semi-developed eastern part of the Green Sea (including Irrla). 

### Secondary Contact

Mos Numena was the dominant religion of the urban Hkaran elite who fled the Downfall, and became more or less the official religion of the Drankorian Empire. As the Drankorian Empire spread, Mos Numena was influenced by various religious traditions, primarily the northern folk religions. Mos Numena, coming out of the late pantheonic era on Hkar and already an archetypal, accretionist religion, was well positioned to incorporate religious traditions on the ground as it spread. 

The particularly Sembaran strain of Mos Numena, for example, grows out of the intermingling of Kestavan ideas and Mos Numena. In the west, the Mawaran variant (relatively undeveloped) also grows out of contact with the northern folk religions of the west coast (tanshi ideas, mostly). 

There is plenty of room for additional variants here: in the Nevos Sea area; in Cymea; in Vostok; and potentially in the east, as well as possibly different flavors of Chardonian religion that represent varying degrees of "folk influence".
