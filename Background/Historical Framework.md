# History of Taelgar
%% status/tim because this is a big re-write. I've left a few specific (TIM CHECK) comments %%

This document outlines a framework for development of consistent historical events in Taelgar. Although this document avoids defining very many specific events, canonical events should generally be consistent with it.

See [[Historical Framework - Open Questions]] for some unresolved topics. See [[Creating New Species]], [[Religious History of Taelgar]], and [[Multiverse]] for useful background. See [[Historical Framework - Discussions]] for commentary and older information.

See also [[Canonical Events]] for a listing of key dates that are considered canonical.

## Overview
The historical framework of Taelgar is organized around five major events, some destructive, some creative, which punctate the timeline:
* [[Riving|The Riving]], the moment time began, and the [[Multiverse#The Creation of the Multiverse|multiverse was created]]
* The creation of humans, and the raising of [[Hkar]]
* [[The Downfall]], when [[Hkar]] sunk and the world was reshaped
* The [[First Plague]] and subsequent fall of the [[Drankorian Empire]]
* The [[Great War]] and death of [[Cha'mutte]]

In very broad terms, 


The first major metaphysical event in history is [[Riving|The Riving]]. This event [[Multiverse#The Creation of the Multiverse|created the multiverse]]. Prior to the [[Riving]] time itself did not exist, and therefore events are hard to describe. However, some key points of this period:

* Cosmology was much simpler than after the Riving. Only the [[Material Plane]], the [[Plane of Magic]], the [[Plane of Creation]], and the transitive connecting planes (the [[Astral Plane]] and [[Ethereal Plane]]) existed. The exact configuration of these planes is unclear and there is no canonical answer; the key point is that the other planes did not exist, not that these planes existed in some particular form. %% Previous invention suggested that perhaps there was only an undifferentiated "plane" that included the plane of magic and the material plane, but a canonical answer does not exist, and is probably not needed %%
* The [[Divine Presence]] and the [[Void Mind]] both, in some fashion, came to be, either at the start of, or during, this period
* Highly powerful magical entities, distinct from the [[Divine Presence]], existed, and included at least (and probably only), some predecessor form of [[Dragons]], [[Fey]], [[Giants]], and [[Elementals]]. What forms these powerful creatures took is not clear or canonical. It is possible that the list above is incomplete.  These might powerful beings of magic, perhaps, born some similarity to their modern day echoes, but perhaps did not. %% Prior invention has referred to elder wyrms, archfey, titans, and elder elementals but it is not clear these categories need to be strictly canonical %%
* The vibe of this period is mythic and transitory. The world can be reshaped with a thought or a gesture and magic is so powerful that the idea of a single, stable reality is questionable in this period. 
- There are no gods but the [[Divine Presence]], and no humanoids. All that exists are the magical beings that are the predecessors of the [[Children of the Riving]]. 
- The form of the world is totally unfixed, as the powerful entities who live on what is Taelgar then use arcane magic to constantly reshape the world into their imagining, and linear causality does not necessary work the way humanoid minds expect. 

The Riving is therefore best thought of, in many ways, as the moment of creation, for it is only after the Riving that events can be described in a linear order. 

The second major metaphysical event is [[The Downfall]], when [[Hkar]] sunk. The Downfall caused mass destruction amongst the great civilizations of non-humans, and reshaped the world towards a more human orientation. Metaphysically, it may (although this is not necessarily canonical) have changed something about the permeability of the [[Land of the Dead]] and made it much harder for new creation to occur. Either way, the period between the Riving and the Downfall is generally categorized by:

* Dominance of non-humans, who have massive continent spanning civilizations
* Significant creation of new species and humanoids (all of the major humanoid species were created in this period, with the possible exception of [[Kenku]] who have a more complex and poorly defined creation story)
* Rapid innovation in human religion, and many new gods being created by the Divine Spark of humanity
* The creation of numerous [[Spiritual Realms]], most likely though the Divine Spark of humanity (although nothing firmly canonical has been established)
* Culturally distinct migrations from Hkar of humanity forming the basis of human differences in the post-Downfall period

After the Downfall, the developed history of Taelgar is focused around the rise and fall of human empires, and is punctuated by two major destructive episodes: the Fall of Drankor and the Great War. 
## The Riving

Linear time began with an event, the [[Riving]], both instantaneous and eternal, a time out of time when the basic form of the  [[Multiverse]] was fixed by the [[Divine Presence]]. During the [[Riving]]:
- The [[Multiverse#The Creation of the Multiverse|multiverse was created]]
- The [[Dragons]], [[Fey]], [[Elementals|Elemental]], and [[Giants]] were created. These four species are sometimes referred to as the [[Children of the Riving]] although it is not clear if that is a meta or in-world name. The exact mechanism of creation is not clear, but it is presumed to be some echo or reflection or evolution of the beings that existed before the Riving. 
- The [[Embodied Gods]] were created, and they in turn created the [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Halflings]], [[Lizardfolk]], and [[Stoneborn]]. These five species are sometimes referred to as the [[Elder Folk]], but it is not clear if this is a meta or in-world name
## Before Humans
_1 - 1520 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The earliest years of history are dominated by the growth and learning of the first sentient races:

%% The below is meant to be one possible story. Outside of [[Alcarinque]], nothing is strictly canonical. See [[Historical Framework - Open Questions#Earliest Empires]] for some questions about the narrative below %%
* The elves, while never very numerous, possessed great wisdom, exceptionally long lifespans, and a powerful command of magic. These traits made the elves the undisputed ruler of the time, and they founded two great empires. In the north, the kingdom of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. grew to stretch from the forests south of [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] to the Mostreve Hills and the Cymean foothills. In the south, the kingdom of Tinwerquë spread from sea to sea in the tropical and subtropical forests south of the great savannahs of the interior.  %% Note: Tinwerquë is probably real but not definitively canonical? %%
* The stoneborn, even less numerous than elves, and always reclusive, do not figure greatly in the stories that remain from these times. As always, the stoneborn hid away in their barren retreats, in the high peaks, the frozen north, and the depths of deserts. However, legends of great masters of art and craft, trained by the Stoneborn, demonstrate the mark they still made on the world.  
* The lizardfolk remained largely in their homelands, in the vast coastal swamps of the southern [[Green Sea]], stretching from north of what is now the great desert all the way to the Sembaran lowlands.
* The dwarves grew quickly after they awoke under the [[Sentinel Range]], known to them as [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], and began to build great halls, delving deeper underground. In these early years, the dwarves were little seen to the outside world, as their underground kingdoms slowly grew to span all of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], from the far north to the borders of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. But by the time Hkar was raised, they were beginning to stretch out, moving to new mountains in the east and west and north, beginning to excavate and build again. 
* The halflings, always wanderers, spread across the [[Green Sea]], and along the coasts, although from where, originally, they came, lore does not say, and the halflings themselves do not share. While they traveled everywhere, they remained most prevalent along the shores of the [[Green Sea]], along the southeast coast of the continent, and across the great plains of the interior.

%% This narrative is heavily northwestern parts of main continent focused, and we shouldn't forget that these non-humans probably spread over larger areas.  %%

## Creation of the Humans
_1520 by the Dwarven Count of Years_
%% Note this date is not strictly canonical but is a good approximation. Could vary by 500 years +/- but there does need to be enough time post-creation to allow the development of human religions prior to the fixed date of the Downfall %%

Humans were created in the year 1520 on the island of [[Hkar]], raised by the [[Divine Presence]] with the gift of the Divine Spark. Over the next 2500 years, humans grew powerful, and explored across the world, but the Void Mind also worked in the shadows, and eventually the conflict, if that is the right word, between the [[Divine Presence]] and the [[Void Mind]] ends in the [[The Downfall|Downfall]].

%% (TIM REVIEW): I think the basic framework of the period between the Riving and the Downfall as fundamentally a conflict between the Divine Presence and the Void Mind as to whether reality would continue to exist is sensible, but I want your feedback before establishing it as canon. The Downfall is a decisive defeat of the Void Mind, despite the cost, and it results in a future where the Void Mind has no hope of unmaking reality. %%

After [[Humans|humanity]] is created, and granted the gift of the Divine Spark, the ability of their souls to work magic and shape the creation of new things in the multiverse. The hopes, dreams, fears, and nightmares of early humans gather force and power. Sometimes shaped by the best of humanity, other times by the twisted creations of the [[Void Mind]], the world in the Age of Creation is both a more vibrant and more dangerous place than in later times, and through the magic of the divine spark, eventually both [[Incorporeal Gods]] and diverse [[Outer Realms]] come into existence.

Additionally, the Void Mind does more two things at this time:
* During the [[Creation of Humans]], manages to [[Creation of the Hobgoblins|create the hobgoblins]]
* Allows or creates cracks in the fabric of reality, allowing the mind flayers and other alien species an entrance into Taelgar 

%% The exact timing of the Void Mind activities is not canonically determined, and is not necessarily linked to specific events%%

At some point during the Age of Creation - after the creation of humanity but before 3000 - the [[Embodied Gods]] of the [[Elder Folk]] sense a turn in the air, a feeling of coming darkness, a premonition, but lacking detail. 

%%exact timing of the sense of forboding is not canonically determined, but the vibe is supposed to be a long period during which most elves discount the dangers predicted, or image it to be about the strange rumors of alien minds in the underdark. whether stoneborn/halflings/lizardfolk are impacted is left undetermined %%

* Among the elves, warnings of danger from [[Elmerca]] begin, and while the elven empires turn to prepare for war, no dangers materialize. Over time, the influence of the ~Wardens of Elmerica~ fade, though the premonitions don't cease. The ~Wardens of Elmerica~ persist as a small, somewhat isolated group, warning of a great danger that never seems to come, while elven society seems to move on around and without them.
* Among the Dwarves, the warnings begin among the ~Cult of the Warrior~, a small group who claim that the Bahrazel known as Azar, the ~Prophet~, is calling them to a new thuhr, a warrior thuhr, to defend the safety of the dwarven people. Dwarven society splits among those who turn to fortifications and defense, and those who wish to flee the mountains, for few dare to reject warnings of the ~Prophet~. For several generations, there is stasis, and debate, until the first wars between the mind flayers and the dwarves erupt deep beneath the earth. Many dwarves, who later become the gnomes, flee the mountains. Many others stay, and fortify their homes. The warrior thuhr becomes established as the defender of dwarven society, deep below the earth.  %% this is one version of events, could be edited / elaborated on; in any case the vibe is supposed to be that the underdark is dangerous but the surface world is not%%

The later half of Age of Creation aligns with the grow and expansion of humanity, and in many ways the growth of humanity, and humanity's interaction with the non-human races, is the most important story of the age. The specific history of Hkar is intentionally left blank, although there are some events that are dated back to Hkar (in particular, the story of  [[Sarqon]] and the [[Chainshroud]] as recounted by the [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Binding Stones]]). Instead, it is best to understand the events on Hkar via the influences they had on religious history, and the migrations from Hkar (which then had significant effects on the development of other human cultures outside of Hkar).
### Growth of Humanity
*roughly 1520-2200, about 700 years*

The first period of humanity on Hkar, is best thought of as the era of personal deities.  This period is characterized by:
* Simple religious beliefs focused around the concept of each human having a personal god
* Extremely rapid population growth as humanity spreads across an idyllic, empty homeland
* A culture without access to arcane or primal magic, but with a rich and complex relationship to "miracles"
* The origin of many [[Outer Realms]] as the divine spark within the early humans influences the spiritual realms

During this time, cults start to develop, as charismatic humans realize that if other people worship their personal gods, they get stronger. This rapidly develops into a widely diverse set of beliefs that could all be characterized as "small gods". This period is characterized by a diversification of culture on Hkar, as different religious practices fragment the uniformity of the early human culture. Exactly what this means is intentionally left blank. Religiously and magically, little changes.

%% exactly how the first 1000 years of humanity is divided into the "era of personal deities" and the "era of cults" is left unclear. the vibe here is rapid growth, rich miracles, and some religious experimentation towards the end of the period, but no incorporeal gods. the religious experimentation that happens is all around gods that are thought to dwell, with humans, on the material plane itself, and not in outer realms beyond the land of the dead.

metaphysically, this is then a time of the development of a variety of fates of souls:
- the various non-divine outer planes ("primal planes") grow around this time, as they attract/gather souls. not all of this is pleasant, and potentially some of this could involve things like demons stealing souls from the land of the dead. probably should be some kind of plane like Hades from Greek myth here, a kind of bland final resting place where weak souls eventually fade. might be metaphysically interesting for this to be basically empty in the modern day...
- there are probably also some ideas about souls "returning to the plane of creation", which is ultimately made of ~soulstuff~ anyway, and so in some cases this is kind of like a "merge with the divine presence" fate for souls once people die. in some cases this might be seen as a kind of precursor to reincarnation, even. 

the general vibe is supposed to be that  this is basically "pre-history" in a sense
%%

### Contact with the Elder Folk
*roughly 2200-2500, about 300 years*

After 700 years of growth and development in isolation on Hkar, the [[Elder Folk]] and humans make contact around the year 2200. Exactly how this happens is not defined, but the impact on [[Hkar]] is large, for two reasons: humanity begins to learn other forms of magic (arcane and primal magic), and begins to imagine divinities as external, powerful entities. The rapid explosion of magical knowledge on Hkar upends human society and leads to a rapid era of cultural evolution. 

%% this could, potentially, be the cause of the first migrations, probably also plants the seeds for the urban/mariner split later, but none of this needs to be fleshed out yet. %%

### Migrations and Emigration
*roughly 2500-3500, about 1000 years*

%%
proposing an alternative timeline that would shift the contact with elder folk period a little earlier, and move the northern migrations *after* contact, as the beginning of a wave of emigrations triggered in part by the social and cultural upheavals caused by the introduction of arcane magic and the idea of incorporeal gods 

this is also the period where the events of the Sarqon and the Chainshroud presumably happen (e.g. between 2600-2800)
%%

Amidst the cultural, religious, and social upheavals spiraling from contact with the Elder Folk, Hkar begins to undergo rapid development and evolution, accompanied by waves of migration and emigration to the land of the [[Elder Folk]], the mainland of Taelgar. 

%% exact dates are not yet canonical %%

At the beginning of this period, around 2500, the first humans leave Hkar (the [[~Northerners~]], in later parlance). The reasons for this are undefined and unclear, but:
* These migrants are not explorers or colonists, but settlers. That is, they do not have a lot of contact back with Hkar %%although some exceptions might exist%%
* They land first on the southwestern coast, near modern-day Illoria, and spread north on the western side of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], before crossing the mountains in the far north and spreading east. They bring with them a variety of [[Northern Folk Religions]], all derived from the common religious practices.
* This first wave of migrants peaks around 2800, and declines quickly after that. 
* This is probably associated in part with a cultural/religious transition on Hkar, such that there are few/no worshippers of "small gods" left on Hkar after about 2800-2900. 

The second wave of migration, the Southerners, is canonically something that happened but also intentionally left as a blank slate. It is between the northern and mariner migrations in time. These people are culturally distinct from the Northerners, and settle predominantly to the south and east of Hkar. 

%% the period between the northerner departures and the mariner migration is intentionally left open, and other cultural migrations could occur during this period. %%

The third wave of migration, the Mariners, is the source of the [[Languages#Eastros Language Family|Eastros languages]] and many of the eastern Green Sea cultures. This starts around 3500 and peaks soon after, perhaps 3650 %% need to work out how this fits with the timelines of humanity in the eastern Green Sea %%. This migration departs from the western edge of Hkar, and sails around the world to the eastern edge of the Green Sea. %% the route is not strictly canonical, although the mariners settling first on the eastern shores of the green sea is %%

In between these major waves of migration from Hkar, there are several smaller ones:

* The canonical Dunmari migration
* Others, potentially, to be determined

It is likely that all migrations after the second wave are culturally cohesive groups, leaving Hkar in some part as a rebellion or in contrast to the growing magical, urban, pantheonic culture of Hkar. 
### Arcane Hegemony
*roughly 3500-4122, about 600 years*

%% nothing is strictly canonical here %%

With the departure of the mariners, the culture of humanity on Hkar grows to become dominated by an educated urban elite, wielding arcane magic, and allied with a group of elves, who became known as the peronar, who taught and guided the development of magic among humanity. 

During this time:
- Mos Numena becomes the dominant religion on Hkar
- Many arcane spells are invented by humanity and magic grows dramatically in power
- Additional minor migrations, typically of small, culturally cohesive groups, leave Hkar, potentially in contrast/rebellion/disagreement with the growing arcane, urban hegemony on Hkar

This era ends with the Downfall, the ~100 year war that sees the destruction of Hkar.

%% some notes from Discord on the Downfall Wars

1. When the Divine Presence creates Hkar + the humans, there is literally something metaphysical of themselves that is embedded in Hkar or a part of Hkar. This strengthens and empowers the divine spark in the humans. During the Downfall Wars, the agents of the Void Mind learn of this, and realize if they can possess and corrupt this whatever, they can destroy and corrupt everything that was imagined with the divine spark, perhaps even humanity itself, and dramatically weaken the Divine Prescene. End the ability to create, at some level. And although the battle is still raging, and the Void Mind forces haven't won, it is too much of a risk. And so the Divine Prescence takes back this whatever which sinks Hkar. And metaphysically, makes them farther away from Taelgar, and makes the creation of new gods harder, weakens divine magic.
2. I think my idea of the vibe of the downfall based on this new idea of the void mind wanting to corrupt hkar is that "without our actions, hkar would have been overwhelmed, but ultimately without the sinking of hkar the war could never have ended". So basically, destruction of hkar was a necessary cost, but without the price paid by the firstborn, probably the armies that reached hkar would have achieved their goal and captured the divine spark or whatever before hkar could be destroyed. something like that
%%
## Age of Humanity
_4122 - present by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The **Age of Humanity** begins in the cataclysm of the destruction of [[Hkar]] and the devastation this causes, and runs to the current day. This time encompasses the rise and fall of the [[Drankorian Empire]] and significant changes in the [[Western Green Sea]] and [[West Coast Region]], as well as the rise of the [[Dunmar|Dunmari]], the [[Great War]] and the defeat of [[Cha'mutte]], the [[Blood Years]], and the recovery and growth of humanity in the time after.
