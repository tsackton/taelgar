# History of Taelgar
%% status/tim because this is a big re-write. I've left a few specific (TIM CHECK) comments %%

This document outlines a framework for development of consistent historical events in Taelgar. Although this document avoids defining very many specific events, canonical events should generally be consistent with it.

See [[Historical Framework - Open Questions]] for some unresolved topics. See [[Creating New Species]], [[Religious History of Taelgar]], and [[Multiverse]] for useful background. See [[Historical Framework - Discussions]] for commentary and older information.

See also [[Canonical Events]] for a listing of key dates that are considered canonical. 

There are several broad regions that have their own detailed histories, which allow for more focus and detail, but which should be consistent with this narrative:

* [[Historical Framework of the Western Green Sea]]
* [[Historical Framework of Greater Sembara]]
* [[Historical Framework of the Dunmari]]
* [[Historical Framework of the West Coast]]

Further regional histories could be developed as needed. 
## Overview
The historical framework of Taelgar is organized around four major cataclysms that reshaped the world order. The immediate aftermath of each of these events typically resulted in a significant new order:

* [[Riving|The Riving]], when time began
* [[The Downfall]], when [[Hkar]] sunk and the world was reshaped
* The [[First Plague]] and subsequent fall of the [[Drankorian Empire]]
* The [[Great War]] and death of [[Cha'mutte]]

In general, this document uses those to document the state of the world before and after the disruption, but this framework document avoids describing what actually happened during the disruption.

## Before the Riving
_Before time_

Prior to the [[Riving]] time itself did not exist, and therefore events are hard to describe. However, some key points of this period:

* The [[Multiverse]] did not exist, only a [[Primordial Cosmos]], although exactly what the Primordial Cosmos was remains undefined.
* The [[Divine Presence]] and the [[Void Mind]] both, in some fashion, came to be, either at the start of, or during, this period
* Highly powerful magical entities, distinct from the [[Divine Presence]], existed, and included at least (and probably only), some predecessor form of [[Dragons]], [[Fey]], [[Giants]], and [[Elementals]]. What forms these powerful creatures took is not clear or canonical. It is possible that the list above is incomplete. These might powerful beings of magic, perhaps, born some similarity to their modern day echoes, but perhaps did not. %% Prior invention has referred to elder wyrms, archfey, titans, and elder elementals but it is not clear these categories need to be strictly canonical %%
- There are no gods but the [[Divine Presence]], and no humanoids. All that exists are the magical beings that are the predecessors of the [[Children of the Riving]]. 
- The form of the world is totally unfixed, as the powerful entities who live on what is Taelgar then use arcane magic to constantly reshape the world into their imagining, and linear causality does not necessary work the way humanoid minds expect. 

In general this period should feel mythic and transitory should rarely if ever be the source of a specific event. It may appear in the stories of some sentient races, in particular the [[Giants]] and [[Fey]]. The world can be reshaped with a thought or a gesture and magic is so powerful that the idea of a single, stable reality is questionable in this period. 

## The Riving
_Before time_

Linear time began with an event, the [[Riving]], both instantaneous and eternal, a time out of time when the basic form of the  [[Multiverse]] was fixed by the [[Divine Presence]]. During the [[Riving]]:

- The [[Multiverse#The Creation of the Multiverse|multiverse was created]]
- The [[Dragons]], [[Fey]], [[Elementals|Elemental]], and [[Giants]] were created. These four species are sometimes referred to as the [[Children of the Riving]] although it is not clear if that is a meta or in-world name. The exact mechanism of creation is not clear, but it is presumed to be some echo or reflection or evolution of the beings that existed before the Riving. 
- The [[Embodied Gods]] were created, and they in turn created the [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Halflings]], [[Lizardfolk]], and [[Stoneborn]]. These five species are sometimes referred to as the [[Elder Folk]], but it is not clear if this is a meta or in-world name
- The [[Void Mind]] creates the [[Three Despairs]] as its avatars and agents in the [[Multiverse]]

%% It is not clear when the first cracks to the Far Realms appeared see [[Historical Framework - Open Questions#Far Realms]] for thoughts %%
## Before Humans
_1 - 1520 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The earliest years of history are dominated by the growth and learning of the first sentient races. This is a period of learning, peace and growth. To the extent the [[Three Despairs]] and the [[Void Mind]] are able to inject danger, it is small and isolated. 

%% The below is meant to be one possible story. Outside of [[Alcarinque]], nothing is strictly canonical. See [[Historical Framework - Open Questions#Earliest Empires]] for some questions about the narrative below %%

* The elves, while never very numerous, possessed great wisdom, exceptionally long lifespans, and a powerful command of magic. These traits made the elves the undisputed ruler of the time, and they founded two great empires. In the north, the kingdom of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. grew to stretch from the forests south of [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] to the Mostreve Hills and the Cymean foothills. In the south, the kingdom of Tinwerquë spread from sea to sea in the tropical and subtropical forests south of the great savannahs of the interior.  %% Note: Tinwerquë is probably real but not definitively canonical? %%
* The stoneborn, even less numerous than elves, and always reclusive, do not figure greatly in the stories that remain from these times. As always, the stoneborn hid away in their barren retreats, in the high peaks, the frozen north, and the depths of deserts. However, legends of great masters of art and craft, trained by the Stoneborn, demonstrate the mark they still made on the world.  
* The lizardfolk remained largely in their homelands, in the vast coastal swamps of the southern [[Green Sea]], stretching from north of what is now the great desert all the way to the Sembaran lowlands.
* The dwarves grew quickly after they awoke under the [[Sentinel Range]], known to them as [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], and began to build great halls, delving deeper underground. In these early years, the dwarves were little seen to the outside world, as their underground kingdoms slowly grew to span all of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], from the far north to the borders of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]]. But by the time Hkar was raised, they were beginning to stretch out, moving to new mountains in the east and west and north, beginning to excavate and build again. 
* The halflings, always wanderers, spread across the [[Green Sea]], and along the coasts, although from where, originally, they came, lore does not say, and the halflings themselves do not share. While they traveled everywhere, they remained most prevalent along the shores of the [[Green Sea]], along the southeast coast of the continent, and across the great plains of the interior.

%% This narrative is heavily northwestern parts of main continent focused, and we shouldn't forget that these non-humans probably spread over larger areas.  %%

In general, this period should feel safe and secure. It is a good period to locate substantial non-human achievements.
## Creation of the Humans
_1520 by the Dwarven Count of Years_
%% Note this date is not strictly canonical but is a good approximation.  See [[Historical Framework - Discussions#Timing of Creation of Humans]] for background %%

The island of [[Hkar]] was raised by the [[Divine Presence]] to be the locus of creation and homeland of humanity, and humanity is created there. Humanity is something new, the first sentience race created with the [[Divine Spark]], the ability to imagine new gods and even [[Spiritual Realms]] into existence. The first humans are isolated on [[Hkar]], and they have little impact on the larger history of Taelgar or some time. But even in the earliest days, the [[Divine Spark]] of humanity beings to impact the wider [[Multiverse]].

%% Some consideration of how this plays out is discussed in [[Religious History of Taelgar]] %%

Either at this point, or perhaps sometime after, the [[Void Mind]] creates [[Goblinoids]]. %% See [[Historical Framework - Open Questions#Creation of Hobgoblins]] %%

## Pre-Downfall History
_1520 - 4122 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The long period between the creation of humanity and the Downfall aligns with the grow and expansion of humanity, and in many ways the growth of humanity, and humanity's interaction with the non-human races, is the most important story of this period. The specific history of Hkar is intentionally left blank, although there are some events that are dated back to Hkar (in particular, the story of  [[Sarqon]] and the [[Chainshroud]] as recounted by the [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Binding Stones]]). Instead, it is best to understand the events on Hkar via the influences they had on religious history, and the migrations from Hkar (which then had significant effects on the development of other human cultures outside of Hkar).

The history of the mainland of Taelgar in this period is largely blank. However, at some point - after the creation of humanity but before 3000 - the [[Embodied Gods]] of the [[Elder Folk]] sense a turn in the air, a feeling of coming darkness, a premonition, but lacking detail. 

%%exact timing of the sense of forboding is not canonically determined, but the vibe is supposed to be a long period during which most elves discount the dangers predicted, or image it to be about the strange rumors of alien minds in the underdark. whether stoneborn/halflings/lizardfolk are impacted is left undetermined %%

* Among the elves, warnings of danger from [[Elmerca]] begin, and while the elven empires turn to prepare for war, no dangers materialize. Over time, the influence of the ~Wardens of Elmerica~ fade, though the premonitions don't cease. The ~Wardens of Elmerica~ persist as a small, somewhat isolated group, warning of a great danger that never seems to come, while elven society seems to move on around and without them.
* Among the Dwarves, the warnings begin among the ~Cult of the Warrior~, a small group who claim that the Bahrazel known as Azar, the ~Prophet~, is calling them to a new thuhr, a warrior thuhr, to defend the safety of the dwarven people. Dwarven society splits among those who turn to fortifications and defense, and those who wish to flee the mountains, for few dare to reject warnings of the ~Prophet~. For several generations, there is stasis, and debate, until the first wars between the mind flayers and the dwarves erupt deep beneath the earth. Many dwarves, who later become the gnomes, flee the mountains. Many others stay, and fortify their homes. The warrior thuhr becomes established as the defender of dwarven society, deep below the earth.  %% this is one version of events, could be edited / elaborated on; in any case the vibe is supposed to be that the underdark is dangerous but the surface world is not%%

Additionally, during this period, but without canonically determined dates:
* [[Thark]] creates the [[Orcs]]
* the [[Void Mind]] creates the [[Goblinoids]]
* Cracks to the [[Far Realms]] appear, and [[Ithilids]] and other creatures being to invade the deeper and isolated parts of Taelgar
#### Growth of Humanity
*roughly 1520-2200, about 700 years*

The first period of humanity on Hkar, is best thought of as the era of personal deities.  This period is characterized by:
* Simple religious beliefs focused around the concept of each human having a personal god
* Extremely rapid population growth as humanity spreads across an idyllic, empty homeland
* A culture without access to arcane or primal magic, but with a rich and complex relationship to "miracles"
* The origin of many [[Outer Realms]] as the divine spark within the early humans influences the spiritual realms

During this time, cults start to develop, as charismatic humans realize that if other people worship their personal gods, they get stronger. This rapidly develops into a widely diverse set of beliefs that could all be characterized as "small gods". This period is characterized by a diversification of culture on Hkar, as different religious practices fragment the uniformity of the early human culture. Exactly what this means is intentionally left blank. Religiously and magically, little changes.

%% exactly how the first 1000 years of humanity is divided into the "era of personal deities" and the "era of cults" is left unclear. the vibe here is rapid growth, rich miracles, and some religious experimentation towards the end of the period, but no incorporeal gods. the religious experimentation that happens is all around gods that are thought to dwell, with humans, on the material plane itself, and not in outer realms beyond th[](Land%20of%20the%20Dead.md)]].

metaphysically, this is then a time of the development of a variety of fates of souls:
- the various non-divine outer planes ("primal planes") grow around this time, as they attract/gather souls. not all of this is pleasant, and potentially some of this could involve things like demons stealing souls from the [[Land of the Dead]]. probably should be some kind of plane like Hades from Greek myth here, a kind of bland final resting place where weak souls eventually fade. might be metaphysically interesting for this to be basically empty in the modern day...
- there are probably also some ideas about souls "returning to the plane of creation", which is ultimately made of ~[[Soulstuff]]~ anyway, and so in some cases this is kind of like a "merge with the divine presence" fate for souls once people die. in some cases this might be seen as a kind of precursor to reincarnation, even. 

the general vibe is supposed to be that  this is basically "pre-history" in a sense
%%

### Contact with the Elder Folk
*roughly 2200-2500, about 300 years*

After 700 years of growth and development in isolation on Hkar, the [[Elder Folk]] and humans make contact around the year 2200. Exactly how this happens is not defined, but the impact on [[Hkar]] is large, for two reasons: humanity begins to learn other forms of magic (arcane and primal magic), and begins to imagine divinities as external, powerful entities. The rapid explosion of magical knowledge on Hkar upends human society and leads to a rapid era of cultural evolution. 

%% this could, potentially, be the cause of the first migrations, probably also plants the seeds for the urban/mariner split later, but none of this needs to be fleshed out yet. %%

### Migrations and Emigration
*roughly 2500-3500, about 1000 years*

Amidst the cultural, religious, and social upheavals spiraling from contact with the Elder Folk, Hkar begins to undergo rapid development and evolution, accompanied by waves of migration and emigration to the land of the [[Elder Folk]], the mainland of Taelgar. 

%% exact dates are not yet canonical - this is also the period where the events of the Sarqon and the Chainshroud presumably happen (e.g. between 2600-2800) %%

At the beginning of this period, around 2500, the first humans leave Hkar (the [[~Northerners~]], in later parlance). The reasons for this are undefined and unclear, but:
* These migrants are not explorers or colonists, but settlers. That is, they do not have a lot of contact back with Hkar %%although some exceptions might exist%%
* They land first on the western coast - perhaps [[Apporia]] or [[Illoria]], but perhaps as far north as the [[~North Chardon Coast~]] - and spread north on the western side of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], before crossing the mountains in the far north and spreading east. They bring with them a variety of [[Northern Folk Religions]], all derived from the common religious practices.
* This first wave of migrants peaks around 2800, and declines quickly after that. 
* This is probably associated in part with a cultural/religious transition on Hkar, such that there are few/no worshippers of "small gods" left on Hkar after about 2800-2900. 

The second wave of migration, the Southerners, is canonically something that happened but also intentionally left as a blank slate. It is between the northern and mariner migrations in time. These people are culturally distinct from the Northerners, and settle predominantly to the south and east of Hkar. 

%% the period between the northerner departures and the mariner migration is intentionally left open, and other cultural migrations could occur during this period. %%

The third wave of migration, the Mariners, is the source of the [[Languages#Eastros Language Family|Eastros languages]] and many of the eastern Green Sea cultures. This starts around 3500 and peaks soon after, perhaps 3650 %% need to work out how this fits with the timelines of humanity in the eastern Green Sea %%. This migration departs from the western edge of Hkar, and sails around the world to the eastern edge of the Green Sea. %% the route is not strictly canonical, although the mariners settling first on the eastern shores of the green sea is %%

In between these major waves of migration from Hkar, there are several smaller ones:

* The canonical Dunmari migration
* Others, potentially, to be determined

It is likely that all migrations after the second wave are culturally cohesive groups, leaving Hkar in some part as a rebellion or in contrast to the growing magical, urban, pantheonic culture of Hkar. 
### Arcane Hegemony
*roughly 3500-4000, about 600 years*

%% nothing is strictly canonical here %%

With the departure of the mariners, the culture of humanity on Hkar grows to become dominated by an educated urban elite, wielding arcane magic, and allied with a group of elves, who became known as the peronar, who taught and guided the development of magic among humanity. 

During this time:
- Mos Numena becomes the dominant religion on Hkar
- Many arcane spells are invented by humanity and magic grows dramatically in power
- Additional minor migrations, typically of small, culturally cohesive groups, leave Hkar, potentially in contrast/rebellion/disagreement with the growing arcane, urban hegemony on Hkar

This era ends with the Downfall, the ~100 year war that sees the destruction of Hkar.
## The Downfall
_4000 - 4133 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

#### The World at the Beginning of the Downfall Wars
![[world-map-history-pre-Downfall.png]]

* Vast non-human civilizations that dominate the land (the area inside the green borders), although the specific details of where, i.e. the elven forest vs the lizardfolk swamp vs the dwarven mountain kingdoms is not canonical
* A arcane human civilization on [[Hkar]] worshipping [[Mos Numena]] (not pictured, to the south and west)
* Scattered humans along the west coast and far north, mostly isolated from Hkar and following [[Northern Folk Religions]]. These are the ancestors of the [[Zimka]], [[Deno'qai]], [[Vargaldi]] and other similar [[~Northerner~|northerners]] but whether i.e. Deno'qai culture exists in a recognizable form is not clear. The general area is marked with brown arrows, but expansion could have started farther south and continued in the same logical patterns. The only canonical part is that these northerners have not penetrated into the Green Sea outside of the [[Western Gulf]]
* An undefined set of human cultures along the [[Eastern Green Sea]], dominated by the mariner culture (known clusters in blue circles, unknown as blue question marks - some of the unknown cultures could have other influences, i.e. from unique migrations or the canonically undefined Southerns, but the northerners would not have reached the Eastern Green Sea by the Downfall)
* A handful of unique cultures, already canonically established: the Skaer, in the Western Green Sea; the Zimka, in the Sembaran highlands, the Tyrwinghans, in Tyrwingha, and the Dunmari, somewhere to the east (marked with an S, Z, T, and D). The Dunmari do not have a canonical location other than "east of the non-human circle"
* A melting pot in the Western Gulf and Sembaran lowlands, where the Skaer, other strands of mariner cultures, and the Zimka are blending and forming a new Tollish culture
* A handful of explicitly undefined places, that may or may not have humans: the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], the [[Nevos Sea]], the [[Yeraad River Basin]], and the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]
* In general: the areas to the east and south, as well as the very far north, are not canonically defined in this period

The exact length of the Downfall Wars is not canonical, but it was likely at least two generations of humans. The Downfall itself occurred in CY 4122, but the period immediately before and after were a time of destruction and war. 

The Downfall is a catacylismic event that restructures the very shape of the continents. It is a massive, total war between the [[Elder Folk]], lead by the elven empires, and the forces of the [[Void Mind]], lead by massive [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] armies. Although the exact chronology is unclear, the end result is the sinking of [[Hkar]]. 

The Downfall had diverse effects on all places and peoples of Taelgar, and is a good boundary to reset from an ancient, mythic past to "history". It saw significant collapse of almost all of the non-human empires, and marked:
* The end of the age of elves and the continent spanning forest empires they had established
* The scattering of the lizardfolk, some staying in the remnants of the great swamps of the prior age, others finding new refuges in the changed world, and many leaving on a great migration to find a new homeland to the south. 
- The dwarven kingdoms, especially those of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] retreat from their deepest depths and fortify the dark passages of the Underdark, far below the surface, against the evils that still lurk in the shadows. Many dwarves found new cities above ground, and look to growing human kingdoms as trading partners. 
* Loss of sustained contact with the "Southern" human culture, which, although canonical, did not play a meaningful role in the developments in western and central Taelgar

It is possible that the Downfall had less cataclysmic effects in the [[Eastern Green Sea]] but in general canonical events should mostly avoid this period, to preserve narrative space for the Downfall Wars themselves to be developed in a future campaign.
## The Drankorian Era
_4133 - 5192 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The city of [[Drankor]] was founded in CY 4133 by refugees from [[Hkar]], and over the next 1000 years grew from a refugee camp to a continent-spanning empire.  The history of this period is defined by the expansion of Drankor, which occurs broadly in three phases:

%% See [[Historical Framework - Open Questions#Drankorian Expansion]]  for open questions %%

* The Founding Period (_CY 4133 - 4483_), when the unsettled lands along the [[Sea of Storms]], the south-western [[Green Sea]] coast, and in the [[Istaros Watershed]] are populated
* The Eastern Expansion (_CY 4485 - 4585_), when the lands north of the [[Mostreve Hills]] are settled, and Drankor establishes a hegemony over the [[Western Gulf]], pushing out the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]]
* The Western Expansion (_CY 4730 - 4780_), when Drankor expands past [[Darba]] to the [[West Coast Region]]

%% some important vibes considerations. what follows is not strictly canonical in detail, but should be roughly followed in vibes to the extent possible. %%

The basic story of Drankor is supposed to be roughly speaking the story of what starts as a "pure, honorable" empire established to protect humanity slowly succumbing to corruption and the call of power. This admittedly mirrors in some general way the history of Numenor, but it is enough of an archetype that I think this isn't a big deal. This has some implications:

- The Founding Period through the beginning of the Western Expansion, basically from CY 4133 until CY 4728 - when Oros the Cruel kills his brother to secure his succession as Emperor - should have a vibe of glorious honorable empire protecting humans. Somewhere we have a note or comment to the effect that the Sembaran "conquest" is more "please leave your magical armies here to protect us" than anything else. The accession of Oros the Cruel is supposed to have kind of a "that wasn't supposed to happen here vibe". Exactly how Oros the Cruel is able to co-opt the mechanisms of state is left undetermined. Even though there are contested successions and suspicious deaths earlier, the vibe of these prior cases is supposed to be peacefully contested and suspicious because of something other than the actions of the next Emperor. Note, also, the first four emperors are Peronar, which should have some impact on the early vibes. This would feel almost elven in some ways. 
- The Western Expansion is prosecuted by three emperors who, to varying degrees, are supposed to be seen by later Drankorians as bad. "Oros the Cruel" and "Thesto the Vengeful" communicate this via their epithets. This is likely a time of substantial unrest in the core of the Empire, but details are not canonical. 
- Valandros, who ended the western wars, is supposed to represent a return to the historical vision of Drankor as a beacon of hope against supernatural dangers. You have a long period of the empire as largely a force for good in the world, with stable borders, no wars against humans, and possibly multiple wars against extraplanar dangers. However, at his point the seeds of destruction are planted. The empire is huge, and profitable, and the vibe of perfection is cracked. This is probably when groups like Omnis Pura begin growing in secret, and when groups like Occulta Ludum start making "ends justify the means" type arguments. 
- Letusas the Quiet and Eiphis the Blind are supposed to be weak emperors who didn't pay attention. "the Blind" is meant to refer to missing the rise of Omnis Pura entirely (could change the epithet to something like "the Clueless"). Eiphis founds the University of Chardon and is perhaps basically an academic. 
- Helea is a non-Hkaran - her exact cultural origins are undetermined - and the vibe should basically be, she is far sighted and sees the danger of groups like Omnis Pura, but at this point it is too late and when Omnis Pura is seriously threatened, they are able to assassinate Helea instead; Omnis Pura wins the civil war. 
- Akaston and Persa are poorly defined, but the last four emperors are all pure Omnis Pura, and start prosecuting wars of conquest to the east (details not clear but this includes the war on Rostaure). 

There is a more detailed timeline of the events within the Drankorian Empire itself here: [[Drankorian Empire#History]]. In general, canonical events inside the Empire should be consistent with that history, and developed on the pages for the Drankorian Empire. Drankor's impact on the surrounding areas changed over time, and can be categorized broadly as follows:
#### Founding Period
_4133 - 4483 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

The Founding Period had little contact with other human civilizations, and to the extent rumors or other stories spread, Drankor would be characterized as miraculous, and a savior of humanity, and a restorer of the land and scrounge of evil. Contact with [[Rostaure|Rostaurë]] may have been established in this time, and the relationship between Drankor and the elvish realms would have been close and cooperative. The should feel like a golden age, where Drankor rapidly grows rich and powerful as it spreads to fertile river valleys that are completely (or at least mostly) depopulated. A "Europe comes to the New World" vibe (but crucially without there being any indigenous people to kill and murder) might be appropriate. 

Canonically, there are few to no humans here - this land primarily was the remains of the elven empire, now deserted - and the river valleys are fertile, so population growth is high. The should result in something like a golden age, where Drankor rapidly grows rich and powerful.

%% There has been no discussion of WHY the elves are gone from [[Alcarinque]], but it is considered canonical that somehow, after the Downfall, there is nothing left save the fragment in [[Orenlas]] %%

%% Tim adding:
- immediately post-Downfall, there are likely other remnants of Alcarinque. Rostarue, for one, could be; there is also still a massive tree in Tokra that might mark another pocket that existed for some time, perhaps even through the fall of Drankor. Orenlas is the only fragment that survives to the modern day. 
- the general assumption is that something happens that kills the trees, and that is was causes the depopulation of Alcarinque. Maybe this is some kind of evil curse released by hobgoblin wizards, or a massive firestorm, or something else
%%

Outside of the Drankorian lands:
* the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] empire is flourishing in the [[Western Green Sea]], controlling [[Tollen]], much of [[Cymea]], the shores of [[Vostok]], the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]], and at least some of the Sembaran coast
* further east in the Green Sea events are unclear, but there should be no major powers pushing west to compete with the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] for dominance of the [[Western Gulf]]
* [[Tyrwingha]] is already under the protection of [[Archfey Ethlenn]], and sees itself as a unique culture, perhaps across a shared region with [[Addermarch]], although details that would implicate Ethlenn's bargain with Tyrwingha should be invented carefully
* the [[~Northerner~]] cultures are continuing to spread; specific details outside of the Sembaran mixing pot are not clear, however these cultures should not have encountered Drankor yet
* the [[Dunmar|Dunmari]] are somewhere east of Drankor, well outside the zone of settlement

%% There is no clear story for when [[Cymea]] and [[~South Cymea~]] are settled by Drankorians -- see [[Historical Framework - Open Questions#Drankorian Expansion]] %%

### Expansion East
_4485 - 4585 by the Dwarven Count of Years__

%% Note: Dates approximate. See [[Canonical Events]] and [[Drankorian Empire#History|the timeline of Drankorian History]] for more information %%

By 4491 the Drankorian armies have begun to move through the Sembaran river valleys, largely unopposed, and Drankorian provinces are established across what will become [[Sembara]] and over the next 50 years or so the inland people of Sembara are assimilated and the Skaer largely pushed out.

%% The vibe of this is not generally war-like, the Skaer have internal-political reasons to be retreating from an empire in this period and we shouldn't imagine this as a war between Drankor and the Skaer, although surely there were some skirmishes and conflict here and there %%

By the end of this period, the assimilation is complete, and even Tyrwingha has come under Drankorian protectorship via the [[Treaty of Tyrwingha]].

Little canonical information exists about the west in this period. [[Zimkova]] is likely forming closer relationships to the dwarves, and is on the fringes of Drankorian politics. Underdetermined is the status of [[Orenlas]] which is surely independent, but is it surrounded by Drankor? %% See [[Historical Framework - Open Questions#Orenlas and Drankor]] %%

Also unclear is when the [[Darkwood]] becomes sinister. %% See [[Historical Framework - Open Questions#Darkwood Creation]] %%

### First Peace
_4585 - 4730 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

%% Note: Dates approximate. See [[Canonical Events]] and [[Drankorian Empire#History|the timeline of Drankorian History]] for more information %%

This was a period of peace and stability. Very little canonical information exists. 
### Western Expansion
_4730 - 4780 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

%% Note: Dates approximate. See [[Canonical Events]] and [[Drankorian Empire#History|the timeline of Drankorian History]] for more information %%

%% The vibe below is canonical but the exact details may not be %%
This was a period of very rapid expansion in the west: more a violent conquest than a slow assimilation. Many of the existing cultures are driven north and east during the advance, and the rest are more forcibly assimilated. This is much more "European conquest of the Americas" (with indigenous murder) than "Romanization of Spain" (i.e. Sembara) -- but also the west coast is pretty sparsely populated overall pre-Drankor. The Drankorian expanse kind of peters out around Lake Valandros - they cannot push eastward into the elven / Deno'qai forests, because elves, and Mawar is established by this time as a defensible territory not worth Drankorian effort to attempt to conquer. Going further upriver from the lake stretches the empire, and once the cross-mountain trade routes are established momentum fades.

%% TODO
 * [ ] Add Nevos/Illoria/Apporia to open questions
 * [ ] Collate some of the other notes and link into discussions
%%
### Golden Age
_4780 - 5098 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

This is a long period of peace and prosperity. There is little canonical information. This period ends with the murder of [[Helea]] by the [[Omnis Pura]] and the beginning of the [[Drankorian Civil War]]. 
### Decline
_5098 - 5192_

The last hundred years of the Drankorian Era are a time of decline and strife. This is the time of [[Apollyon]].

## The Fall of Drankor
_5192-5210 by the Dwarven Count of Years_

%% Use this section to state the basic state of play at the end of the Drankorian period as this establishes a good baseline for future development need to collate from lots of places but basically: %%

In 5192, the [[First Plague]] destroys the Drankorian Empire and brings with it a massive loss of life across much of what was the Drankorian heartland. Almost immediately on the heels of the plague, the [[Dunmar|Dunmari]] come from the east and spread across the [[Dunmari Basin]], establishing modern [[Dunmar]].
