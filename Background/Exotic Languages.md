In general many species will speak some sort of language unique to that species. This tracks exotic languages that canonically exist, or ideas for languages that probably exist, as well as whatever details have been made up for them. It is currently written more as background. See [[Languages]] for more general coverage of this topic, including background, open questions, etc.

Note: Any language that is often learned by PCs should be moved to the main [[Languages]] page once canonical details have been established and linked from here.

Background notes on exotic languages that likely or definitely exist.

* **High Draconic***: The ancient language of the great wyrms of old. Very rare to learn, but said to be powerfully magical. No specific alphabet or real world analog defined. Unclear if the split between High and Low is canonical. See [[Languages - Open Questions#Dragons]]
* **Low Draconic**: Related in some fashion to High Draconic but spoken by kobolds and lesser dragons. The nuances and magical power of High Draconic is usually lost on those who only know Low Draconic, although they are usually mutually comprehensible for basic communication. Unclear if the split between High and Low is canonical. See [[Languages - Open Questions#Dragons]].
* **Deep Speech:** This language is more a rumor than a known fact, but is suspected to be the tongue of the alien aberrations of the underdark, notably the mind flayers, their slaves and the twisted creations. Difficult to learn. There are likely more than one variant of this, to represent the plural aspect of the Far Realms. No strictly canonical information.
* **Gnoll**: a hideous combination of Abyssal and a magical beast tongue of hyenas; can attempt to understand if you speak Abyssal. See [[Languages#Gnoll]].
* **Bullywug**: spoken by bullywugs mostly. Unclear canon as bullywugs are a bit undefined.
* **Grell**: a corrupted form of Deep Speech, spoken by the greel. Unclear canon as grell are a bit undefined.

In general, it is acceptable that most species will have a language of some kind, (although occasionally it will be shared with another species) and this serves as a place to document ill-defined and semi-canonical examples that are not quite worth adding to the main [[Languages]] page.
