%% Tim, 1/22/2025: updated the finished regions with additional details about what is/is not invented; feel free to trim if too wordy %%

The document outlines the major regions of Taelgar and the current state of development. The intention is to try to better document which areas are truly blank slates, which areas have some firm facts that are not fully developed, and which areas are significantly developed.

The numbers align with the regions on the map below.
### 1. Endless Ocean and the Far West 

This includes everything west of [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] and the [[~North Chardon Coast~]]. Primarily, this is the [[~Sayuna Islands~]], as well as any mysterious additional islands or underwater features lurking in the Endless Ocean.

There are no canonical facts about this region except that [[Merfolk]] are known to live here. It is expected that whatever development occurs around the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] will be based on an early [[~Northerner~]] migration from Hkar, but this is not canonical. Potentially the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] do not even exist.

Note a canonical ancient and important merfolk city, [[Omi]], is in this region.

### 2. The Northwest Coast
This includes the western coastal region north of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]] including the coasts the large bay north of Mawakel ([[~North Bay~]]), the large headland farther north, and the large unnamed island off the Mawakel Peninsula. The existence of the [[~North Bay~]] is required by more canonical development of [[Mawakel Peninsula]] and the [[Voltara]] region.

Otherwise, there is nothing canonical about this region, although it has been assumed to have been one of the first points where the [[~Northerner~]] culture emigrated to from [[Hkar]] and thus cultural development in this regional should probably be inspired by the other [[~Northerner~]] cultures (although other options are possible).

### 3. Chardonian Empire and the Mawakel Peninsula
This region stretches north from the [[~South Chardon River~]] and includes the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the [[Voltara]] region, as well as the [[~North Chardon Coast~]], the [[Tawir Forest]], and the [[Mawakel Peninsula]].

Although some features lack names, it is substantially developed, especially the river valleys. In particular, the Chasa River Valley, including the city of Chardon, is substantially developed, although the pre-Great War history of this region is fairly flimsy. The immediate area of Voltara, and the Mawakel Peninsula, are also substantially developed. 

There are some relatively blank spaces along the [[~North Chardon Coast~]] and [[Lake Valandros]], and some lightly developed areas on the coast west of [[Voltara]]. 

While this region has a canonical history in broad strokes, many details between the fall of Drankor and the Great War are only weakly developed, or left blank. Although canonically most of this region is part of the Chardonian Empire, the local political cultures are largely undeveloped. 

## 4. Apporia and the Nevos Sea
This region includes the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], the two islands of [[Illoria]], the [[Yeraad River Basin]], and the [[Nevos Sea]]. Only the north coast of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] has a sketched history with some canonical details, and detailed development of current day political units, climate, and geography. 

There are a number of lightly defined regions here (in particular, [[Illoria]] and the [[Yeraad River Basin]] are lightly sketched, at best). The exact cultural heritage of [[Illoria]] is unclear, as is its history during the [[Drankorian Era]], although some well-developed post-Great War history involves Illoria. 

This region has several intentional blank or mysterious areas, particularly the interior and western coast of the Apporian Peninsula. The eastern coast of the Apporian Peninsula is plausibly either Illorian or something mysterious, but has not been canonically developed at all.  

## 5. Dunmari Basin
This region includes the [[Dunmari Basin]], the [[Myraeni Gap]], and the [[Garamjala Desert]] as well as the ancient city of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the [[Sea of Storms]]. Although the desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries, the history of this land is well established, as is the climate, geography and human civilizations.

## 7. Northernwestern Interior
