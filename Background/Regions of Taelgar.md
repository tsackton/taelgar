%% some reorganization to standardize descriptions a little%%

The document outlines the major regions of Taelgar and the current state of development. The intention is to try to better document which areas are truly blank slates, which areas have some firm facts that are not fully developed, and which areas are significantly developed.

The numbers align with the regions on the map below.
### 1. Endless Ocean and the Far West 

*Area*: This includes everything west of [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] and the [[~North Chardon Coast~]]. Primarily, this is the [[~Sayuna Islands~]], as well as any mysterious additional islands or underwater features lurking in the Endless Ocean.

*Canonical Development:* There are no canonical facts about this region except that [[Merfolk]] are known to live here; an ancient and important merfolk city, [[Omi]], is in this region. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* It is expected that whatever development occurs around the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] will be based on an early [[~Northerner~]] migration from Hkar, but this is not canonical. Potentially the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] do not even exist.

*Blank Regions:* Essentially this entire region is blank. The [[~Sayuna Islands~]] are best left undeveloped until needed for a game. 

*Adventures:* The merfolk arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign traveled to [[Omi]], but otherwise this region has not see any actual play time. 

### 2. The Northwest Coast

*Area:* This includes the western coastal region north of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]] including the coasts the large bay north of Mawakel ([[~North Bay~]]), the large headland farther north, and the large unnamed island off the Mawakel Peninsula. 

*Canonical Development:* The existence of the [[~North Bay~]] is required by more canonical development of [[Mawakel Peninsula]] and the [[Voltara]] region.

*Non-Canonical Development:* This region has been assumed to have been one of the first points where the [[~Northerner~]] culture emigrated to from [[Hkar]] and thus cultural development in this regional should probably be inspired by the other [[~Northerner~]] cultures, although other options are possible.

*Blank Regions:* Essentially this entire region is intentionally blank and should be left undeveloped until needed for a game. 

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region. 
### 3. Chardonian Empire and the Mawakel Peninsula

*Area:* This region stretches north from the [[~South Chardon River~]] and includes the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the [[Voltara]] region, as well as the [[~North Chardon Coast~]], the [[Tawir Forest]], and the [[Mawakel Peninsula]].

*Canonical Development:* Although some features lack names, this region is substantially developed in broad strokes, especially the current day large-scale political organization, and the basic geography and climate. The Chasa River Valley, including the city of Chardon, has lots of current-day canonical details; the immediate area of Voltara, and the Mawakel Peninsula, are also substantially developed. Most of the history of this region only exists in very broad strokes, although the Mawakel Peninsula has extensive historical development. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* While this region has a canonical history in broad strokes, many details are only weakly or non-canonically developed, or left blank. Although canonically most of this region is part of the Chardonian Empire, the local political cultures are largely undeveloped. 

*Blank Regions:* The  [[~North Chardon Coast~]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the region stretching from the [[Tawir Forest]] to the coast west of [[Voltara]] are largely blank, but could use some additional development. The history and current political culture of this region exists only in very broad strokes, for the most part, and could use additional development. Nowhere in this region is intentionally left blank, except perhaps the [[Tawir Forest]] itself. 

*Adventures:* The [[Mawar Adventures]] episodes are entirely set in this region, on the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]; the [[Great Library Campaign]] is based in [[Voltara]] with several adventures covering the local area around Voltara. 

## 4. Apporia and the Nevos Sea
This region includes the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], the two islands of [[Illoria]], the [[Yeraad River Basin]], and the [[Nevos Sea]]. Only the north coast of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] has a sketched history with some canonical details, and detailed development of current day political units, climate, and geography. 

There are a number of lightly defined regions here (in particular, [[Illoria]] and the [[Yeraad River Basin]] are lightly sketched, at best). The exact cultural heritage of [[Illoria]] is unclear, as is its history during the [[Drankorian Era]], although some well-developed post-Great War history involves Illoria. 

This region has several intentional blank or mysterious areas, particularly the interior and western coast of the Apporian Peninsula. The eastern coast of the Apporian Peninsula is plausibly either Illorian or something mysterious, but has not been canonically developed at all.  

## 5. Dunmari Basin
This region includes the [[Dunmari Basin]], the [[Myraeni Gap]], and the [[Garamjala Desert]] as well as the ancient city of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the [[Sea of Storms]]. Although the desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries, the history of this land is well established, as is the climate, geography and human civilizations.

## 6. Eastern Drankor
This region is almost entirely undeveloped. Canonically, it was part of the heartland of Drankor, and the  historical elven realm of [[Rostaure]] is in this region. However, the fate of this region since the fall of Drankor is undetermined, although it is assumed that at least the western parts of this region, closest to Drankor, are dangerous wilderness. 

## 7. Northernwestern Interior
This region includes the far northern section of the Sentinels, the [[Forest of Nightmares]], and the [[Blackwater Fens]]. This region has been the setting of a couple of adventures, and is one of the major areas of the [[Northern Tribes|Northern Deno'qai Tribes]] but there are numerous blank spots. This region includes the historical realm of [[Pandar]], about which few canonical details exist other than it was [[Cha'mutte]]'s primary permanent territory, and a large number of kenku enslaved by Cha'mutte lived here prior to the [[Great War]]. 

In general, this region was dominated by [[Cha'mutte]] during the [[Great War]] and is best kept relatively empty as a setting for dark and dangerous things.

## 8. The Sentinels
This region is dominated by the [[Sentinel Range]] and the forests on its western slopes. The dwarven kingdoms of the Sentinels are fairly well established. The elven kingdoms of [[Ainumarya]] are canonical, but not well established and potentially a source of some mystery. In general this land has few people outside of the [[Deno'qai]], although once it was the thriving heartland of elven kingdoms. 

## 9. Greater Sembara
This region includes [[Sembara]], [[Tollen]], [[Tyrwingha]], [[Cymea]], [[Vostok]] and [[Skaerhem]]. The culture and history are well developed as far back as the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. [[Zimkova]], [[Vostok]], and [[Cymea]] are considerably less well developed than the remainder of the region, although large scale events that impact the rest of [[Greater Sembara]] have largely been developed, and invention within the lightly developed regions has to conform to a canonical history.

The [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] was well developed up to the 1680s, but the exact modern form is not clear.

## 10. Istabor and South Cymea
Although [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city, with numerous brainstorming notes about its history, very little has been canonically committed. Other than being Drankorian, [[~South Cymea~]] is a complete blank.

The current state of the [[Plaguelands]] is intentionally not well developed, but [[~South Cymea~]] is not intentionally mysterious.

## 11. Western Green Sea
This region has significant brainstorming, but outside of some small details created about [[Irrla]], has no canonical developments.

## 12. North Green Sea Coast
The culture of [[Ursk]] is well developed, although there are a number of blank spots in the history. The remainder of the region is fairly well developed as wilderness with numerous dangers, and is unlikely to hold significant cultures beyond the [[Vargaldi]]. This area has a significant frost giant presence, in [[Kaldhalla]], and the conflict between frost giants and white dragons has substantially shaped some of the details of the wilderness here. Canonically there are established dwarven and stoneborn cultures in the [[Svinjo Mountains]], but no details are invented about these peoples. 

## 13. Eastern Green Sea
Outside of the existence of [[Medju]] and the [[Vermillion Isles]], this area is an almost complete blank. There is numerous brainstorming, but a general reluctance to commit to a specific detailed history in the absence of a campaign or significant series of adventures being set in this region. This is likely an area of rich and complex human civilizations. 

## 14. The Far North
Outside of the existence of the descendants of [[Vimfrost]] plagueing the region, this area is almost entirely undeveloped, and is largely intentionally blank. Any human civilizations here would be highly magic or scattered and small, and not likely to impact other cultures or the grand sweep of history. A large number of kenku canonically make their home on the western plains of this region, near the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], but no details have been developed. 

## 15. The Far South
Outside of the swamps and jungles of [[Orekatu]], hints of an ancient trading civilization (Targu), the presence of gnomes, and the existence of a vast desert somewhere in this region, there is no canonical development here. This area is explicitly left blank and should not be developed without careful consideration.
