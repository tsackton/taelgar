%% some reorganization to standardize descriptions a little%%

The document outlines the major regions of Taelgar and the current state of development. The intention is to try to better document which areas are truly blank slates, which areas have some firm facts that are not fully developed, and which areas are significantly developed.

The numbers align with the regions on the map below.
### 1. Endless Ocean and the Far West 

*Area*: This includes everything west of [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] and the [[~North Chardon Coast~]]. Primarily, this is the [[~Sayuna Islands~]], as well as any mysterious additional islands or underwater features lurking in the Endless Ocean.

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* There are no canonical facts about this region except that [[Merfolk]] are known to live here; an ancient and important merfolk city, [[Omi]], is in this region. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* It is expected that whatever development occurs around the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] will be based on an early [[~Northerner~]] migration from Hkar, but this is not canonical. Potentially the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] do not even exist.

*Blank Regions:* Essentially this entire region is blank. The [[~Sayuna Islands~]] are best left undeveloped until needed for a game. 

*Adventures:* The merfolk arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign traveled to [[Omi]], but otherwise this region has not see any actual play time. 

### 2. The Northwest Coast

*Area:* This includes the western coastal region north of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]] including the coasts the large bay north of Mawakel ([[~North Bay~]]), the large headland farther north, and the large unnamed island off the Mawakel Peninsula. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The existence of the [[~North Bay~]] is required by more canonical development of [[Mawakel Peninsula]] and the [[Voltara]] region.

*Non-Canonical Development:* This region has been assumed to have been one of the first points where the [[~Northerner~]] culture emigrated to from [[Hkar]] and thus cultural development in this regional should probably be inspired by the other [[~Northerner~]] cultures, although other options are possible.

*Blank Regions:* Essentially this entire region is intentionally blank and should be left undeveloped until needed for a game. 

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region. 
### 3. Chardonian Empire and the Mawakel Peninsula

*Area:* This region stretches north from the [[~South Chardon River~]] and includes the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the [[Voltara]] region, as well as the [[~North Chardon Coast~]], the [[Tawir Forest]], and the [[Mawakel Peninsula]].

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* Although some features lack names, this region is substantially developed in broad strokes, especially the current day large-scale political organization, and the basic geography and climate. The Chasa River Valley, including the city of Chardon, has lots of current-day canonical details; the immediate area of Voltara, and the Mawakel Peninsula, are also substantially developed. Most of the history of this region only exists in very broad strokes, although the Mawakel Peninsula has extensive historical development. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* While this region has a canonical history in broad strokes, many details are only weakly or non-canonically developed, or left blank. Although canonically most of this region is part of the Chardonian Empire, the local political cultures are largely undeveloped. 

*Blank Regions:* The  [[~North Chardon Coast~]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the region stretching from the [[Tawir Forest]] to the coast west of [[Voltara]] are largely blank, but could use some additional development. The history and current political culture of this region exists only in very broad strokes, for the most part, and could use additional development. Nowhere in this region is intentionally left blank, except perhaps the [[Tawir Forest]] itself. 

*Adventures:* The [[Mawar Adventures]] episodes are entirely set in this region, on the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]; the [[Great Library Campaign]] is based in [[Voltara]] with several adventures covering the local area around Voltara; the Dunmar Frontier campaign Chardon/Elderwood arc was set in this region. 

## 4. Apporia and the Nevos Sea

*Area:* This region includes the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], the islands of [[Illoria]], the [[Yeraad River Basin]], and the [[Nevos Sea]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The north coast of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] has a sketched history with some canonical details, and detailed development of current day political units, climate, and geography. The general vibes of Illoria, and the existence of large lizardfolk communities in the [[Yeraad River Basin]], are canonical. There is some significant post-Great War historical development, mostly concerning Dunmar and Apporia, that involves Illoria and needs to be considered in any future developments concerning Illoria. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* There are a number of lightly defined regions here (in particular, [[Illoria]] and the [[Yeraad River Basin]] are lightly sketched, at best). The exact cultural heritage of [[Illoria]] is unclear, as is its history during the [[Drankorian Era]].

*Blank Regions*: Illoria itself lacks anything more than some basic vibes, and the Emerald Bay coast of the Apporian Peninsula, outside the terminus of the [[Old Chardon Canal]], is nearly entirely blank. These areas are not intentionally blank and could use development. On the Apporia Peninsula, the interior and western coasts are intentionally left blank and mysterious. The southern and eastern coasts of the Apporian Peninsula is plausibly either Illorian or something mysterious, but has not been canonically developed at all.  The overall history of this region, at least outside the intentionally blank areas, could use development building on the existing fragments. 

*Adventures:* Illoria has been at the edge of several Dunmari Frontier adventures, but only two sessions were actually set in the Nevos Sea, and primarily involved traveling to and then through the [[Old Chardon Canal]]. The merfolk arc of the Dunmari Frontier was partially set on the north coast of Apporia. 
## 5. Dunmari Basin

*Area:* This region includes the [[Dunmari Basin]], the [[Myraeni Gap]], and the [[Garamjala Desert]] (including the orc kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]]), as well as the ancient city of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the [[Sea of Storms]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The current day climate and geography of this entire region, and the history dated back to before the Downfall, is extensively developed, although much of the history before the Great War is developed only in broad strokes. The history, religion, and politics of Dunmar and Xurkhaz are extensively developed. The desolation around Drankor (including the ruined city itself), the wastes of the Garamjala, and the [[Awakened Jungle]] have significant, but not exhaustive, development. Any future development in this region needs to be aware of significant constraints imposed by existing development. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Much of the history of the Drankorian Empire is only broadly sketched, especially in the core of the Empire represented by this region. The pre-Downfall history of [[Alcarinque]] is only very lightly developed. The [[Nayan Floodplains]] have much less development than the rest of [[Dunmar]], especially about current-day political and cultural details. The [[Yuvanti Mountains]], although canonically the home of the [[Nardith]], has very little detailed development. The region around the [[Shrev]] and south is only lightly sketched, as is the [[Myraeni Gap]]. 

*Blank Regions:* The desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries, but need to be developed with canonical details in mind. The exact impact of the Downfall Wars on [[Alcarinque]], and the fall of the elven empires, is explicitly left blank, to be explored in a potential future Downfall Wars campaign. The [[Nayan Floodplains]] and the [[Yuvanti Mountains]]/[[Nardith]] could use more detailed development, and the area south of the [[Shrev]] as well as the [[Myraeni Gap]] are both potentially open for development, contingent on some details of [[Dunmar#History|Dunmari history]].

*Adventures:* The Dunmar Frontier campaign has involved numerous adventures in this region, including [[Central Dunmar]], [[Darba]] and the [[Darba Highlands]], [[Eastern Dunmar]], [[Tokra]], [[Karawa]], the [[Nashtkar]] and other regions east of Karawa, including [[Kharsan]], [[Xurkhaz]], the [[Awakened Jungle]], and [[Drankor]]. The [[Oskar and Riswynn Adventures]] were largely set in [[Nardith]] and nearby regions, but did not involve much worldbuilding. 
## 6. Eastern Drankor

*Area:* This region includes the area east of the [[Istaros]], west of the [[~Eastern Mountains~]], and south of [[~South Cymea~]]. Most of this region is poorly defined and outside the [[Istaros]] itself, features are largely unnamd. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* This region is almost entirely undeveloped. Canonically, it was part of the heartland of Drankor, and the historical elven realm of [[Rostaure]] was in this region. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* The fate of this region since the fall of Drankor is undetermined, although it is assumed that at least the western parts of this region, closest to Drankor, are dangerous wilderness. The [[~Eastern Mountains~]] are tentatively the eastern border of the [[Drankorian Empire]], but this is not strictly canonical. 

*Blank Regions:* The entire region is essentially blank in the modern day, and most of the historical details of this region are not developed.

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region. 

## 7. Northernwestern Interior

*Area:* This region includes the far northern section of the Sentinels, the [[Forest of Nightmares]], [[Pandar]], and the [[Blackwater Fens]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* [[Pandar]] was canonically [[Cha'mutte]]'s primary permanent territory, and a large number of kenku enslaved by Cha'mutte lived here prior to the [[Great War]]. The history of the [[History of the Northern Deno'qai|northern Deno'qai]], including some details of the Great War era, and their current [[Northern Tribes|culture and territory]] is well developed. The [[Forest of Nightmares]], and the [[Blackwater Fens]], have some canonical details. Stoneborn, at least, canonically live in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] in this region. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Some basic overview of the history of Pandar and Cha'mutte's activities exist, but these are largely brainstorming, or at best weakly canonical. No details of Stoneborn settlements exist, except their presence. 

*Blank Regions:* Much of this region is functionally a blank spot. In general, this region was dominated by [[Cha'mutte]] during the [[Great War]] and is best kept relatively empty as a setting for dark and dangerous things.

*Adventures:* The Delwath solo arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign was set in the northern Deno'qai territory and the Forest of Nightmares; the black dragon arc of the Great Library campaign was set in the Blackwater Fens. 

## 8. The Sentinels

*Area:* This region includes the Sentinel range in its entirety, and the forests on the western slopes of the Sentinels, including [[Ainumarya]] and the [[Elderwood]].

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The dwarven kingdoms of the Sentinels are fairly well established, although many details remain to be invented. The elven kingdoms of [[Ainumarya]] are canonical, but not well established and potentially a source of some mystery. In general this land has few people outside of the [[Deno'qai]], although once it was the thriving heartland of elven kingdoms. The general geography and climate of this area is well established. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* There is some minor development around the Stoneborn settlements in the southern Sentinels. Much of the history of [[Ainumarya]] is broad-strokes and relatively open. [[Urlich Pass]], now a region of significant devastation, is canonically important as the site of Cha'mutte's defeat, but why it was important is unclear, although probably has something to do with being a locus of the power of the Firstborn. The existence of Underdark-like deep caverns below the Sentinels is canonical, but not fully developed. 

*Blank Regions:* While there are no truly blank regions here, the details of the dwarven kingdoms, the details of [[Ainumarya]], and a more fully-fleshed out development of [[Deno'qai]] culture and settlement in this area, would all be valuable. [[Urlich Pass]] and the pseudo-Underdark are intentionally blank slates. 

*Adventures:* The Dunmari Frontier campaign Elderwood arc occurred in this region; the Great Library dwarven kingdom arc also occurred in this region, including passing through a Deno'qai village from early days of Deno'qai development ([[Raha]]), and significant invention around[[Am'khazar]]. Any development should keep in mind that the region on the Sembaran border will likely feature in the Cleenseau campaign at some point. 

## 9. Greater Sembara

%% note: in the gazetteer we consider Tollen, Cymea, Vostok, and Skaerhem to be part of the Western Green Sea, not Greater Sembara. Might make more sense? The detail is fairly unbalanced here. Or maybe leave Tollen and possibly western Cymea in Greater Sembara? %%

*Area:* This region includes [[Sembara]], [[Tollen]], [[Tyrwingha]], [[Addermarch]], [[Cymea]], [[Vostok]], [[Orenlas]], and [[Skaerhem]].

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The culture and history are well developed as far back as the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. [[Zimkova]], [[Vostok]], and [[Cymea]] are considerably less well developed than the remainder of the region, although large scale events that impact the rest of [[Greater Sembara]] have largely been developed. The [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] was well developed up to the 1680s.

*Non-Canonical Development:* The exact details after the 1680s of the southern part of this region, particularly the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]], is roughly sketched but not developed canonically in detail. Some open questions remain about history, and some details are only lightly sketched or not completely canonical. [[Vostok]], [[Cymea]] especially outside of [[Western Cymea]], and [[Zimkova]] are generally not developed in detail, although canonical loose vibes exist for [[Cymea]] and [[Zimkova]], at least. 

*Blank Regions:* The only thing that approaches a blank slate here is [[Vostok]] (and perhaps [[Cymea]] and/or [[Zimkova]]), which has numerous brainstorming but minimal canonical detail. The [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] are largely undeveloped from a geographic point of view, although the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] are fairly well developed in culture, politics, religion, and history. Any development in this region needs to consider a significant amount of canonical history, geography, and culture. The [[Grastenvakt|Grastenvakt]], the wall across the north of Vostok, is intentionally left blank. 

*Adventures:* The [[Cleenseau Campaign]] and the Addermarch campaign are entirely set within this region, in southern Sembara and Addermarch respectively. The Dunmar Frontier campaign spent significant time in Tollen, and visited ruins in Cymea, Orenlas, and the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]]. 

## 10. Istabor and South Cymea

*Area:* This includes the northern part of the [[Istaros Watershed]] starting southeast of [[Aurbez Plateau]] and related areas, and stretches to the coast of the Green Sea. It is bordered by the [[Mostreve Hills]], the [[Darkwood]], [[Orenlas]], and the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]] to the north, and [[Xurkhaz]] to the south. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city, and this region is canonically now mostly known as the [[Plaguelands]] and is dangerous and unsettled. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Isingue has significant brainstorming around its history, but little has been canonically committed. [[~South Cymea~]] was canonically a Drankorian province. 

*Blank Regions:* Although [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city, with numerous brainstorming notes about its history, very little has been canonically committed. Other than being Drankorian, [[~South Cymea~]] is a complete blank. The current state of the [[Plaguelands]] is intentionally not well developed, but [[~South Cymea~]] is not intentionally mysterious.

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region, although the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] flew over [[Isingue]] in [[Vindristjarna]]. Any development should keep in mind that [[Isingue]] is likely central to an upcoming arc of the Dunmar Fellowship campaign. 

## 11. Western Green Sea

*Area:* This area includes the western half of the Green Sea itself, including the islands in this area, most notably [[Irrla]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* Irrla has some development, and canonically contains at least a large hobgoblin realm and a human realm known as [[Republic of Svolhas]].

*Non-Canonical Development:* The Republic of Svolhas is probably mariner, but nothing about them, including religion is particularly determined, other than a recent (1740s) war with the hobgoblins provoking a naval bulidup. Some notes about patterns of wind and currents exist, but are not strictly canonical. The pirate ship [[Flaming Tempest]] visited the unnamed island off the coast of Cymea, but the details of why are not canonically determined. 

*Blank Regions:* This region has significant brainstorming, but outside the details above is entirely a blank slate. 

*Adventures:* The Wellby solo arc, and the unplayed but canonical adventures of the Vindristjarna crew while the Dunmar Fellowship was in Ursk, both involved hobgoblin raiders from Irrla, but no adventures have actually be set in this region.  

## 12. North Green Sea Coast

*Area:* This region includes [[Ursk]], the [[Svinjo Mountains]], and the[[~Northern Boreal Forest~]], generally south of the [[Ket]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The culture of [[Ursk]] is well developed, although there are a number of blank spots in the history. The [[Vargaldi]] are also reasonably well developed, although generally only in broad strokes. This area has a significant frost giant presence, in [[Kaldhalla]], and the conflict between frost giants and white dragons has substantially shaped some of the details of the wilderness here. Canonically there are established dwarven and stoneborn cultures in the [[Svinjo Mountains]], but no details are invented about these peoples. The existence of a vampire kingdom on the western borders of Ursk is canonical, although the fate of this region after the interventions of the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] has not been determined. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* The history of [[Ursk]] is relatively poorly developed, especially prior to the Great War; the origins of the Urskan people are not canonically determined, although these are presumed to be mariners of some kind. The religion of Ursk is unclear, although divine magic is exceedingly rare among Urskans. The history of [[Kaldhalla]] before [[Vimfrost's War]] is only weakly sketched. In general, this region is assumed to be largely wilderness, and dangerous, outside the developed regions, but details are somewhat vague, especially along the coast to the west of Ursk, which is canonically dangerous but whether something beyond vampires lurks here is undetermined. 

*Blank Regions:* There is plenty of room for additional oddities and dangers in this region, and the coast west of [[Ursk]] is relatively undeveloped. This longer term history of this region is largely blank, except for recent history of Ursk and ancient history of the Vargaldi. However, the region as a whole is largely complete from a vibes perspective, so new development needs to conform to the existing overall design of the region. 

*Adventures:* The Ursk arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign traveled extensively across this region, including to [[Kaldhalla]], the [[~Northern Boreal Forest~]], and [[Ursk]],

## 13. Eastern Green Sea

*Area:* This region includes the [[~Eastern Islands~]], the northern Green Sea coast east of [[Ursk]], and the southern Green Sea coast east of [[~South Cymea~]], as well as the eastern half of the Green Sea itself.  

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The city of [[Medju]] has been loosely invented, but only in the context of rumors that reached other places. The [[Vermillion Isles]] have been reasonably well developed. The wizard [[Arryn]] lives in some part of the [[~Eastern Islands~]] some distance north of the [[Vermillion Isles]]. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* An aquatic elven culture living around and beneath the island of [[Quanyi]] was invented for the Wellby solo, but potentially could be retconned. The [[~Eastern Islands~]] tentatively are assumed to largely move and shift (with some exceptions, such as [[Quanyi]] that is known as the anchored island), but details are vague and what is rumor vs truth is undetermined. Some notes about winds and currents exist, but these are not strictly canonical. 

*Blank Regions:* Outside of the existence of [[Medju]] and the [[Vermillion Isles]], this area is an almost complete blank. There is numerous brainstorming, but a general reluctance to commit to a specific detailed history in the absence of a campaign or significant series of adventures being set in this region. This is likely an area of rich and complex human civilizations. 

*Adventures:* The Wellby solo arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign was set on the [[Vermillion Isles]] and on an unnamed island home to a wizard originally from Tollen, [[Arryn]]. Otherwise, no adventures have been set here. 

## 14. The Far North

*Area:* This region is poorly defined as little geographic development exists, but roughly speaking it includes everything north of the [[~North Bay~]] coast, [[Pandar]], [[Vostok]], and the [[Ket]], and then follows an arbitrary line north of the Green Sea east of [[Ursk]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* This region, particular the mountains north of [[Ursk]], are home to many white dragons, including the descendants of [[Vimfrost]], which has significant influences both on this area and regions to the south. A large number of kenku canonically make their home on the western plains of this region, near the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], but no details have been developed. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* The area north of [[Vostok]] is tentatively invented as a subarctic grassland, and tentatively assumed to be a place where kenku settled after escaping from Pandar, but details are vague, at best, and the geography / climate is not set in stone. 

*Blank Regions:* This area is almost entirely undeveloped, and is largely intentionally blank. Any human civilizations here would be highly magic or scattered and small, and not likely to impact other cultures or the grand sweep of history. 

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region.

## 15. The Far South

*Area:* This region is poorly defined as little geographic development exists, but functionally it is everything east of the [[~Eastern Mountains~]] and south of the Green Sea coastal realms. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The swamps and jungles of [[Orekatu]] have some basic canonical development, primarily on geography and climate. There is canonically a great desert somewhere in this region. Dinosaurs canonically live in [[Orekatu]], at least, and are in some cases partially domesticated by [[Lizardfolk]]. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Gnomes are generally thought to inhabit this region, but details are vague. Hints of an ancient trading civilization (Targu) exist, but details are vague / non-existent.

*Blank Regions:* This area is explicitly left blank and should not be developed without careful consideration. 

*Adventures:* The Kenzo solo arc from the Dunmar Frontier campaign was set in western Orekatu and the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]] immediately to the west of [[Orekatu]], but otherwise this region has seen no play time.
