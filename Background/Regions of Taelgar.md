The document outlines the major regions of Taelgar and the current state of development. The intention is to try to better document which areas are truly blank slates, which areas have some firm facts that are not fully developed, and which areas are significantly developed.

The numbers align with the regions on the map below.
### 1. Endless Ocean and the Far West 

This includes everything west of [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] and the [[~North Chardon Coast~]]. Primarily, this is the [[~Sayuna Islands~]], as well as any mysterious additional islands or underwater features lurking in the Endless Ocean.

There are no canonical facts about this region except that [[Merfolk]] are known to live here. It is expected that whatever development occurs around the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] will be based on an early [[~Northerner~]] migration from Hkar, but this is not canonical. Potentially the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] do not even exist.

Note the canonical city of merfolk, [[Omi]], is in this region.

### 2. The Northwest Coast
This includes the western coastal region north of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]] including the coasts the large bay north of Mawakel ([[~North Bay~]]), the large headland farther north, and the large unnamed island off the Mawakel Peninsula. The existence of the [[~North Bay~]] is required by more canonical development of [[Mawakel Peninsula]] and the [[Voltara]] region.

Otherwise, there is nothing canonical about this region, although it has been assumed to have been one of the first points where the [[~Northerner~]] culture emigrated to from [[Hkar]] and thus cultural development in this regional should probably be inspired by the other [[~Northerner~]] cultures. 

### 3. Chardonian Empire and the Mawakel Peninsula
This region stretches north from the [[~South Chardon River~]] and includes the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the [[Voltara]] region, as well as the [[~North Chardon Coast~]], the [[Tawir Forest]], and the [[Mawakel Peninsula]].

Although some features lack names, it is substantially developed, especially the river valleys. There are some relatively blank spaces along the [[~North Chardon Coast~]] and west of [[Voltara]], but this region in general has detailed history and current political units. Any further invention would need to be consistent with a substantial body of work.

## 4. Apporia and the Nevos Sea
This region includes the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], the two islands of [[Illoria]], the [[Yeraad River Basin]], and the [[Nevos Sea]]. There are a number of lightly defined regions here (in particular, [[Illoria]] is not fully invented). But outside the interior of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] (which is not well defined prior to the [[Great War]]), there is not a lot of blank areas.

The exact cultural heritage of [[Illoria]] is unclear however, as is its history during the [[Drankorian Era]].

## 5. Dunmari Basin
This region includes the [[Dunmari Basin]], the [[Myraeni Gap]], and the [[Garamjala Desert]] as well as the ancient city of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the [[Sea of Storms]]. Although the desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries, the history of this land is well established, as is the climate, geography and human civilizations.


## 7. Northernwestern Interior
