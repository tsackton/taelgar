%% some reorganization to standardize descriptions a little%%

The document outlines the major regions of Taelgar and the current state of development. The intention is to try to better document which areas are truly blank slates, which areas have some firm facts that are not fully developed, and which areas are significantly developed.

The numbers align with the regions on the map below.

### 2. The Northwest Coast

*Area:* This includes the western coastal region north of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]] including the coasts the large bay north of Mawakel ([[~North Bay~]]), the large headland farther north, and the large unnamed island off the Mawakel Peninsula. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The existence of the [[~North Bay~]] is required by more canonical development of [[Mawakel Peninsula]] and the [[Voltara]] region.

*Non-Canonical Development:* This region has been assumed to have been one of the first points where the [[~Northerner~]] culture emigrated to from [[Hkar]] and thus cultural development in this regional should probably be inspired by the other [[~Northerner~]] cultures, although other options are possible.

*Blank Regions:* Essentially this entire region is intentionally blank and should be left undeveloped until needed for a game. 

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region. 
### 3. Chardonian Empire and the Mawakel Peninsula

*Area:* This region stretches north from the [[~South Chardon River~]] and includes the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the [[Voltara]] region, as well as the [[~North Chardon Coast~]], the [[Tawir Forest]], and the [[Mawakel Peninsula]].

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* Although some features lack names, this region is substantially developed in broad strokes, especially the current day large-scale political organization, and the basic geography and climate. The Chasa River Valley, including the city of Chardon, has lots of current-day canonical details; the immediate area of Voltara, and the Mawakel Peninsula, are also substantially developed. Most of the history of this region only exists in very broad strokes, although the Mawakel Peninsula has extensive historical development. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* While this region has a canonical history in broad strokes, many details are only weakly or non-canonically developed, or left blank. Although canonically most of this region is part of the Chardonian Empire, the local political cultures are largely undeveloped. 

*Blank Regions:* The  [[~North Chardon Coast~]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the region stretching from the [[Tawir Forest]] to the coast west of [[Voltara]] are largely blank, but could use some additional development. The history and current political culture of this region exists only in very broad strokes, for the most part, and could use additional development. Nowhere in this region is intentionally left blank, except perhaps the [[Tawir Forest]] itself. 

*Adventures:* The [[Mawar Adventures]] episodes are entirely set in this region, on the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]; the [[Great Library Campaign]] is based in [[Voltara]] with several adventures covering the local area around Voltara; the Dunmar Frontier campaign Chardon/Elderwood arc was set in this region. 

## 4. Apporia and the Nevos Sea

*Area:* This region includes the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], the islands of [[Illoria]], the [[Yeraad River Basin]], and the [[Nevos Sea]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The north coast of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] has a sketched history with some canonical details, and detailed development of current day political units, climate, and geography. The general vibes of Illoria, and the existence of large lizardfolk communities in the [[Yeraad River Basin]], are canonical. There is some significant post-Great War historical development, mostly concerning Dunmar and Apporia, that involves Illoria and needs to be considered in any future developments concerning Illoria. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* There are a number of lightly defined regions here (in particular, [[Illoria]] and the [[Yeraad River Basin]] are lightly sketched, at best). The exact cultural heritage of [[Illoria]] is unclear, as is its history during the [[Drankorian Era]].

*Blank Regions*: Illoria itself lacks anything more than some basic vibes, and the Emerald Bay coast of the Apporian Peninsula, outside the terminus of the [[Old Chardon Canal]], is nearly entirely blank. These areas are not intentionally blank and could use development. On the Apporia Peninsula, the interior and western coasts are intentionally left blank and mysterious. The southern and eastern coasts of the Apporian Peninsula is plausibly either Illorian or something mysterious, but has not been canonically developed at all.  The overall history of this region, at least outside the intentionally blank areas, could use development building on the existing fragments. 

*Adventures:* Illoria has been at the edge of several Dunmari Frontier adventures, but only two sessions were actually set in the Nevos Sea, and primarily involved traveling to and then through the [[Old Chardon Canal]]. The merfolk arc of the Dunmari Frontier was partially set on the north coast of Apporia. 
## 5. Dunmari Basin

*Area:* This region includes the [[Dunmari Basin]], the [[Myraeni Gap]], and the [[Garamjala Desert]] (including the orc kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]]), as well as the ancient city of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the [[Sea of Storms]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The current day climate and geography of this entire region, and the history dated back to before the Downfall, is extensively developed, although much of the history before the Great War is developed only in broad strokes. The history, religion, and politics of Dunmar and Xurkhaz are extensively developed. The desolation around Drankor (including the ruined city itself), the wastes of the Garamjala, and the [[Awakened Jungle]] have significant, but not exhaustive, development. Any future development in this region needs to be aware of significant constraints imposed by existing development. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Much of the history of the Drankorian Empire is only broadly sketched, especially in the core of the Empire represented by this region. The pre-Downfall history of [[Alcarinque]] is only very lightly developed. The [[Nayan Floodplains]] have much less development than the rest of [[Dunmar]], especially about current-day political and cultural details. The [[Yuvanti Mountains]], although canonically the home of the [[Nardith]], has very little detailed development. The region around the [[Shrev]] and south is only lightly sketched, as is the [[Myraeni Gap]]. 

*Blank Regions:* The desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries, but need to be developed with canonical details in mind. The exact impact of the Downfall Wars on [[Alcarinque]], and the fall of the elven empires, is explicitly left blank, to be explored in a potential future Downfall Wars campaign. The [[Nayan Floodplains]] and the [[Yuvanti Mountains]]/[[Nardith]] could use more detailed development, and the area south of the [[Shrev]] as well as the [[Myraeni Gap]] are both potentially open for development, contingent on some details of [[Dunmar#History|Dunmari history]].

*Adventures:* The Dunmar Frontier campaign has involved numerous adventures in this region, including [[Central Dunmar]], [[Darba]] and the [[Darba Highlands]], [[Eastern Dunmar]], [[Tokra]], [[Karawa]], the [[Nashtkar]] and other regions east of Karawa, including [[Kharsan]], [[Xurkhaz]], the [[Awakened Jungle]], and [[Drankor]]. The [[Oskar and Riswynn Adventures]] were largely set in [[Nardith]] and nearby regions, but did not involve much worldbuilding. 
## 6. Eastern Drankor

*Area:* This region includes the area east of the [[Istaros]], west of the [[~Eastern Mountains~]], and south of [[~South Cymea~]]. Most of this region is poorly defined and outside the [[Istaros]] itself, features are largely unnamd. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* This region is almost entirely undeveloped. Canonically, it was part of the heartland of Drankor, and the historical elven realm of [[Rostaure]] was in this region. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* The fate of this region since the fall of Drankor is undetermined, although it is assumed that at least the western parts of this region, closest to Drankor, are dangerous wilderness. The [[~Eastern Mountains~]] are tentatively the eastern border of the [[Drankorian Empire]], but this is not strictly canonical. 

*Blank Regions:* The entire region is essentially blank in the modern day, and most of the historical details of this region are not developed.

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region. 

## 8. The Sentinels

*Area:* This region includes the Sentinel range in its entirety, and the forests on the western slopes of the Sentinels, including [[Ainumarya]] and the [[Elderwood]].

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The dwarven kingdoms of the Sentinels are fairly well established, although many details remain to be invented. The elven kingdoms of [[Ainumarya]] are canonical, but not well established and potentially a source of some mystery. In general this land has few people outside of the [[Deno'qai]], although once it was the thriving heartland of elven kingdoms. The general geography and climate of this area is well established. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* There is some minor development around the Stoneborn settlements in the southern Sentinels. Much of the history of [[Ainumarya]] is broad-strokes and relatively open. [[Urlich Pass]], now a region of significant devastation, is canonically important as the site of Cha'mutte's defeat, but why it was important is unclear, although probably has something to do with being a locus of the power of the Firstborn. The existence of Underdark-like deep caverns below the Sentinels is canonical, but not fully developed. 

*Blank Regions:* While there are no truly blank regions here, the details of the dwarven kingdoms, the details of [[Ainumarya]], and a more fully-fleshed out development of [[Deno'qai]] culture and settlement in this area, would all be valuable. [[Urlich Pass]] and the pseudo-Underdark are intentionally blank slates. 

*Adventures:* The Dunmari Frontier campaign Elderwood arc occurred in this region; the Great Library dwarven kingdom arc also occurred in this region, including passing through a Deno'qai village from early days of Deno'qai development ([[Raha]]), and significant invention around[[Am'khazar]]. Any development should keep in mind that the region on the Sembaran border will likely feature in the Cleenseau campaign at some point. 



## 10. Istabor and South Cymea

*Area:* This includes the northern part of the [[Istaros Watershed]] starting southeast of [[Aurbez Plateau]] and related areas, and stretches to the coast of the Green Sea. It is bordered by the [[Mostreve Hills]], the [[Darkwood]], [[Orenlas]], and the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]] to the north, and [[Xurkhaz]] to the south. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city, and this region is canonically now mostly known as the [[Plaguelands]] and is dangerous and unsettled. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Isingue has significant brainstorming around its history, but little has been canonically committed. [[~South Cymea~]] was canonically a Drankorian province. 

*Blank Regions:* Although [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city, with numerous brainstorming notes about its history, very little has been canonically committed. Other than being Drankorian, [[~South Cymea~]] is a complete blank. The current state of the [[Plaguelands]] is intentionally not well developed, but [[~South Cymea~]] is not intentionally mysterious.

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region, although the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] flew over [[Isingue]] in [[Vindristjarna]]. Any development should keep in mind that [[Isingue]] is likely central to an upcoming arc of the Dunmar Fellowship campaign.
