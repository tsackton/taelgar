%% Tim, 1/22/2025: updated the finished regions with additional details about what is/is not invented; feel free to trim if too wordy %%

%% Mike: adding a few notes on the remaining regions, but it could use clarification/corrections %%

The document outlines the major regions of Taelgar and the current state of development. The intention is to try to better document which areas are truly blank slates, which areas have some firm facts that are not fully developed, and which areas are significantly developed.

The numbers align with the regions on the map below.
### 1. Endless Ocean and the Far West 

This includes everything west of [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] and the [[~North Chardon Coast~]]. Primarily, this is the [[~Sayuna Islands~]], as well as any mysterious additional islands or underwater features lurking in the Endless Ocean.

There are no canonical facts about this region except that [[Merfolk]] are known to live here. It is expected that whatever development occurs around the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] will be based on an early [[~Northerner~]] migration from Hkar, but this is not canonical. Potentially the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] do not even exist.

Note a canonical ancient and important merfolk city, [[Omi]], is in this region.

### 2. The Northwest Coast
This includes the western coastal region north of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]] including the coasts the large bay north of Mawakel ([[~North Bay~]]), the large headland farther north, and the large unnamed island off the Mawakel Peninsula. The existence of the [[~North Bay~]] is required by more canonical development of [[Mawakel Peninsula]] and the [[Voltara]] region.

Otherwise, there is nothing canonical about this region, although it has been assumed to have been one of the first points where the [[~Northerner~]] culture emigrated to from [[Hkar]] and thus cultural development in this regional should probably be inspired by the other [[~Northerner~]] cultures (although other options are possible).

### 3. Chardonian Empire and the Mawakel Peninsula
This region stretches north from the [[~South Chardon River~]] and includes the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the [[Voltara]] region, as well as the [[~North Chardon Coast~]], the [[Tawir Forest]], and the [[Mawakel Peninsula]].

Although some features lack names, it is substantially developed, especially the river valleys. In particular, the Chasa River Valley, including the city of Chardon, is substantially developed, although the pre-Great War history of this region is fairly flimsy. The immediate area of Voltara, and the Mawakel Peninsula, are also substantially developed. 

There are some relatively blank spaces along the [[~North Chardon Coast~]] and [[Lake Valandros]], and some lightly developed areas on the coast west of [[Voltara]]. 

While this region has a canonical history in broad strokes, many details between the fall of Drankor and the Great War are only weakly developed, or left blank. Although canonically most of this region is part of the Chardonian Empire, the local political cultures are largely undeveloped. 

## 4. Apporia and the Nevos Sea
This region includes the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], the two islands of [[Illoria]], the [[Yeraad River Basin]], and the [[Nevos Sea]]. Only the north coast of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] has a sketched history with some canonical details, and detailed development of current day political units, climate, and geography. 

There are a number of lightly defined regions here (in particular, [[Illoria]] and the [[Yeraad River Basin]] are lightly sketched, at best). The exact cultural heritage of [[Illoria]] is unclear, as is its history during the [[Drankorian Era]], although some well-developed post-Great War history involves Illoria. 

This region has several intentional blank or mysterious areas, particularly the interior and western coast of the Apporian Peninsula. The eastern coast of the Apporian Peninsula is plausibly either Illorian or something mysterious, but has not been canonically developed at all.  

## 5. Dunmari Basin
This region includes the [[Dunmari Basin]], the [[Myraeni Gap]], and the [[Garamjala Desert]] as well as the ancient city of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the [[Sea of Storms]]. Although the desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries, the history of this land is well established, as is the climate, geography and human civilizations.

## 6. Eastern Drankor
This region is almost entirely undeveloped. Canonically, it was part of the heartland of Drankor, but it has been a dangerous wilderness since the fall of Drankor.

%% Tim, do you have anything ? Is the above correct %%

## 7. Northernwestern Interior
This region includes the far northern section of the Sentinels and the [[Forest of Nightmares]] and the [[Blackwater Fens]]. This region has been the setting of a couple of adventures, and is one of the major areas of the [[Northern Tribes|Northern Deno'qai Tribes]] but there are numerous blank spots.

In general, this region was dominated by [[Cha'mutte]] during the [[Great War]] and is best kept relatively empty as a setting for dark and dangerous things.

## 8. The Sentinels
This region is dominated by the [[Sentinel Range]] and the forests on its western slopes. The dwarven kingdoms of the Sentinels are fairly well established. The elven kingdoms of the [[Elderwood]] are canonical, but not well established and potentially a source of some mystery. In general this land has few people outside of the [[Deno'qai]].

## 9. Greater Sembara
This region includes [[Sembara]], [[Tollen]], [[Tyrwingha]], [[Cymea]], [[Vostok]] and [[Skaerhem]]. The culture and history are well developed as far back as the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. [[Zimkova]], [[Vostok]], and [[Cymea]] are considerably less well developed than the remainder of the region, although large scale events that impact the rest of [[Greater Sembara]] have largely been developed, and invention within the lightly developed regions has to conform to a canonical history.

The [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] was well developed up to the 1680s, but the exact modern form is not clear.

## 10. Istabor and South Cymea
Although [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city, with numerous brainstorming notes about its history, very little has been canonically committed. Other than being Drankorian, [[~South Cymea~]] is a complete blank.

The current state of the [[Plaguelands]] is intentionally not well developed, but [[~South Cymea~]] is not intentionally mysterious.

## 11. Western Green Sea
This region has significant brainstorming, but outside of some small details created about [[Irrla]], has no canonical developments.

## 12. North Green Sea Coast
The culture of [[Ursk]] is well developed, although there are a number of blank spots in the history. The remainder of the region is fairly well developed as wilderness with numerous dangers, and is unlikely to hold significant human cultures. 

## 13. Eastern Green Sea
Outside of the existence of [[Medju]] and the [[Vermillion Isles]], this area is an almost complete blank. There is numerous brainstorming, but a general reluctance to commit to a specific detailed history in the absence of a campaign or significant series of adventures being set in this region. This is likely an area of rich and complex human civilizations. 

## 14. The Far North
Outside of the existence of the descendants of [[Vimfrost]] plagueing the region, this area is almost entirely undeveloped, and is largely intentionally blank. Any human civilizations here would be highly magic or scattered and small, and not likely to impact other cultures or the grand sweep of history.

## 15. The Far South
Outside of the swamps of [[Orekatu]] and hints of an ancient trading civilization (the Targu), there is no canonical development here. This area is explicitly left blank and should not be developed without careful consideration.
