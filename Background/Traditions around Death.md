**WARNING: THIS DOCUMENT IS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED FULLY CANONICAL**

This document collects not-yet-fully-developed thoughts on funerary traditions across Taelgar. For more canonical information, see:
* [[Dunmari Religious Practice#Funerals|Dunmari tradition]]
* [[Sembaran Funerary Traditions]]
* [[Tyrwinghan Funerary Traditions]]
* [[Kestavan Funerary Traditions]]

There are also some mostly-canonical background notes on [[Drankorian Funeral Traditions]].

### Elves
Elves are canonically technically immortal, but experience decreasing sense of connection to the [[Material Plane]] over the generations, until at some point (usually between 700 and 1000 years, but rarely longer) an elf decides to stop trying to stay alive and lets death come.

Some important meta-points here:
* This needs to feel dissimilar to the Tolkien-esque "pull of the west (heaven)". An elf stops living not because the outer realm is calling and they can no longer resist the call, but because the effort of staying alive is more than they want to exert
* This also shouldn't feel like depression/can't get out of bed - the idea is something foreign to human experience that is hard to capture in words, but it should feel like a personal decision and yet also an almost inevitable, like a return/reunion with something and also an unfamiliar journey

%%
I think my vision is that this isn't a longing for something else, or a weariness of the world, but more of just a feeling that this time is complete. it would be like a sense of "doneness" more than anything else.

The exact details of elven traditions around death are intentionally vague at the moment, but the elves did inspire the Drankorian traditions, I think, in two important ways:
* The elves are *in control* either consciously or unconsciously. The willingly enter the [[Land of the Dead]], at some level, rather than have to be pulled or guided there by an external entity. Therefore the concerns of the [[#Northern Traditions]] would be very foreign to the elvish experience - even an elf dying of some magical disease or their wounds likely has some ability to see the door, so to speak and willingly walk into the [[Land of the Dead]]. For elves, it is perhaps not something the gods help with, but something the gods have given them as an ability. So perhaps just as the ability to have children (create new life/souls) is granted to the elves by [[Aldanor]], the elves see the ability to leave the Material Realm as granted to them by [[Elmerca]] - but it is *their* ability, at some level, not [[Elmerca]]. Perhaps even as far back as Hkar, this elven attitude was permeating the Drankorian religious tenets, encouraging strains of thought that centralized the journey through the [[Land of the Dead]] as dangerous, as opposed to the transition from Taelgar to the [[Land of the Dead]]. Perhaps elven stories of the dangers in the [[Land of the Dead]] helped cement this
* Without detailing the specifics, elves likely would have some ceremony of passing. I think this would have the flavor of a goodbye, but perhaps not a particularly "human feast" flavor. It would likely take place over some relatively extended period of time (months/years?) and have some cyclic element, as well as perhaps even a return to sleep and dreaming(? not sure about that). I think the state of a dying elf and the *attitude* of a goodbye/farewell ritual amongst elves transmuted in human culture to a more specific event. Although elves might also have a specifically timed "goodbye" for when an elf has completed the journey through the [[Land of the Dead]].

Initial notes from Tim:

Worth also keeping in mind here that, at least in the early days, Drankorian culture is heavily influenced by elves/peronar. Later Drankor turns sharply away from the elves but when these traditions are being formed it is likely that the elven view of death would be significant. 

I think that this could fit in with the idea of fading away -- elves probably see the journey through the [[Land of the Dead]] as something an elder consciously chooses it is time to do, and perhaps there is some sense in which elves retain a greater sense of self or even skills and powers of their material selves as they travel. But even so, the journey is dangerous. This could also subtly contribute to the Drankorian view of what is important to focus on: for elves who are ready to depart, the question of their soul entering the [[Land of the Dead]] is guaranteed. 

Not sure what other influences might spread here but perhaps the farewells below are partially elvish in origin: when elders decide to depart it might be common to hold ceremonies such as this in elven culture after they have reached their final resting place.

### Northern Traditions

In general, the basic framework (as seen in the kestavo tradition) of of "small god guides soul through [[Land of the Dead]], which requires a body in order for the gods to find the soul" is probably broadly true among all the northern folk religions. However, the specific details will vary. The kestavo are very location-oriented, with each spirit having a home, whereas the Deno'qai are not. So although the tanshi would serve the same role in Deno'qai culture, with appropriate sacrifices replacing a location/place based framework. this might have some implications for recovery of lost bodies - for example the Deno'qai would see less of a problem with mass graves on a battlefield assuming appropriate sacrifices could attract the tanshi to the burial location. 

### Chardon

%% These are old notes, which were partially designed to enforce a dubiously-canonical distinction between Chardon and Mawar in order to set up a conflict i[](Wazir.md)]] backstory. The conflict is key, but it doesn't have to be about grave goods or funeral rites. It is likely that Chardon has significant commonalities with the Drankorian practice, and this section needs updating based on the refreshed Drankorian background, which changes the emphasis somewhat from previous iterations.

The Chardonian tradition is a more direct descendant of the Drankorian tradition, and never gained the emphasis on burial as a way to connect the soul to the gods. Mos Numena, after Drankor fell, did evolve in both Chardon and Sembara to be less about the humans and more about the gods -- so Chardon shares some of the Sembaran beliefs that the ten-day rituals are more about giving the gods an opportunity to open the door. But also, Sembara doesn’t have the same ‘single patron god’ idea as Sembara, so whereas in Sembara the actual actions of the god is not seen as very important (in that it is usually expected that the patron of the community will be the one overseeing the soul, even if it is guiding the soul to some other god’s realm), in Chardon, much more emphasis is placed on interpreting signs and portents about where the soul has gone and which god is helping the soul on its journey.
  
But other than the shift in emphasis, the actual Chardonian traditions are largely the same as the Drankorian ones -- a period of public and ritual mourning for ten days, while the body lies at rest, and then cremation for most bodies, and crypts or other elaborate memorials for others.

This specific concern is likely no longer accurate:

The Chardonian tradition emphasizes the need for the gods to hear the rituals, and emphasizes simplicity in the preparation of the body. Signs and symbols and adornments distract the gods, in the same way gods can hear prayers most clearly when a single god is prayed to at a time.

The intention here is to contrast with the Mawar tradition of grave goods/tokens to set up the fight Wazir had in Chardon. Him wanted desperately to include grave goods with his son's burial, the Chardonians believing that would keep the gods from finding his soul.

#### Mawar
%%
These are also old notes, that should be considered largely non-canonical. However, it might be interesting for Mawar to have some of the same inspirations as Sembara that derive from an ancient "northern gods" tradition 

The Mawar tradition shares with the Sembaran tradition an emphasis, from the old northern ideas of the small gods, of a personal guide. But in the Mawar tradition it is the ancestors and demi-god saints who guide the dead to the afterlife. A largely Chardonian tradition exists, in terms of the rituals and activities that occur, except that the expectation is that the body will be buried with tokens of demi-gods/ancestors, before the 10-day ends, and the ritual period takes place without the body as the focus.

What is important in Mawar tradition however, are the tokens, not really the burial, and so it is often the case that for example sailors, or warriors going into battle will bring/wear several tokens on their bodies, in case they die lost at sea or whatever.
