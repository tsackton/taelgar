%%^Date:1720%%
The Army of the South is a regiment of 400 soldiers, divided into four regiments of 80 soldiers each plus the garrison at Fellburn. Usually two regiments rotate on patrol in the [[Borderlands]] and two are based at the garrison in Fellburn. 

Since the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]] this army has been disbursed. The surviving troops are largely part of an informal army under the command of [[Jacques Bellemont]], the Duke of Wisford. Some question whether this is treason, but the Duke feels this is necessary to defend the [[Duchy of Wisford]] from undead, given the failure of the Army of the South to do so.

One of the regiments is scattered across the [[Borderlands]], although various patrols have turned up in [[Cleenseau]] and elsewhere.

%%% Note: Conceptually the post-1720 history of this army is very different but it hard to write because it depends a bit on events in the Clee game. Currently, the army is basically the personal army of the Duke of Wisford; this can't last, but how it gets resolved is a little bit unclear. Most likely, the Army is recreated after the various crises of 1720 largely along the same lines as it was before, but that could change.
