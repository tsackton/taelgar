%% Tim: write mostly to keep main page very simple, lots of brainstorming below %%

Tyrwingha does not have a standing army in the same way that Sembara does. However, the borderlands along the [[Mostreve Hills]] are guarded by three garrisons, loosely organized as the Army of Mostreve.

This army is divided into three garrisons along the [[Mostreve Hills]] - the [[Aben Garrison|garrison of the Aben]], in the headwaters of the [[Aben]] River, the [[Cyfarthfa Garrison|garrison of Cyfarthfa]] closest to the capital, and the [[Deganwy Garrison|garrison of Deganwy]] on the borders of [[Addermarch]]. The Aben garrison sees action most years, and is a gathering spot for [[The Rangers]].

General brainstorming:

* In game, the main vibe has been a small professional force and a much larger force called up for the undead crises
* There are hints that the Oracle of the Riven may control a group of warlocks who work either alongside or as part of the main army

My gut feeling is that the Tyrwinghan army should be more organized around commanders than soldiers and should have a culture of muster and return to villages, rather than a professional standing army like in Sembara. 

Perhaps something like:, divided into three companies:
* Company of the Sword = regular soldiers, commanded by a captain appointed by the monarch
* Company of the Riven = warlocks, commanded by a captain appointed by the Oracle of the Riven

And then maybe even some kind of Company of the Fey which used to be actually commanded by  a fey, but isn't any longer (or maybe even is?) and which contains fey and fey-touched

Then the idea would be that each garrison shares troops from each company, who have their own command structure but with no definitive overall ruler. The garrison is perhaps even commanded by some type of Council of the Camp that has members of each of the three companies for that garrison, and operates by majority. 

I think  the tradition of border defense probably dates back to ancient times - the Company of the Fey (needs a better name) might have gotten started defending the border against [[Morlaith]] and the Tyrwinghan Army has never been part of the Sembaran army.

There are only three periods with significant overlap between the rulers of Tyrwingha and Sembara:

* Great War era - basically from [[Derik I]] til the end of the Great War
* the Radiant Alliance era - the 100 years from [[Elaine I]] through [[Cece I]], mostly with lots of hobgoblins
* modern day, since [[Elaine II]] was crowned

In general, I wonder if the modern professional army of Sembara during the Great War got its start as an offshot from some ancient Ethlenn-organized border defense structure in Tyrwingha. During the Radiant Alliance era, I suspect that the armies of Tyrwingha and Sembara were probably mostly quite separate, although perhaps by the end of Cece's reign there was some degree of intermixing. 

I see the biggest Sembaran intrusion and intermixing as basically happening during the second half of Cece's reign, and during that period perhaps there was a bit of cultural intermixing in the army. But realistically, I also think that the Tyrwinghan military is probably organized much more around fey-touched warlocks and sorcerers than anything else, which makes integration with Sembara hard.
