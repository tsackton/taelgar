# The Umbral Covenant

The Umbral Covenant is the name used in Chardonian and Apporian records for the shadow host that rose in the interior of [[Apporia]] during the [[War of the Dark Rift]]. Over thirteen years of war (DR 1584–1597), the Covenant conquered much of northern Apporia, disrupted the [[Old Chardon Canal]] trade, and brought ruin to cities along the [[Gulf of Chardon]].

The war ended in DR 1597 when the Covenant launched a Shadow Armada against [[Chardon]] and was destroyed by the Chardonian navy. Chardonian writers often treat this victory as the turning point that made Chardon an imperial naval power and accelerated its later conquest of [[Portalia]] and the canal approaches.
