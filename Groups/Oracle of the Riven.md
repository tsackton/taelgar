# Oracle of the Riven

The royal electors of [[Tyrwingha]]. There are six of these royal electors:

* The Oracle of the Red
* The Oracle of the Black
* The Oracle of the White
* The Oracle of the Green
* The Oracle of the Fallen
* The Unseen Oracle

[[Archfey Ethlenn|Ethlenn]] is said to be the seventh elector, although of course it is rare for her to actually cast a vote. Traditionally, the oracles are all powerful warlocks, but in recent years this tradition has not always been maintained.

When an oracle dies, tradition holds that the [[Archfey Ethlenn]] appoints a new oracle. In living memory however, this has not happened. Instead, the remaining oracles elect a new oracle (although by what means, no one knows) and the abstention of Ethlenn is considered her assent.

There are various references and hints in some documents, i.e. [[Letter from the Oracle of the Red to the Mostreve Warlocks]] and a general vibe of 'mysterious' and 'fey', but very little has been made up beyond what is here.
