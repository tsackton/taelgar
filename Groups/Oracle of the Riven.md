# Oracle of the Riven

The royal electors of [[Tyrwingha]]. There are six of these royal electors:

* The Oracle of the Red
* The Oracle of the Black
* The Oracle of the White
* The Oracle of the Green
* The Oracle of the Fallen
* The Unseen Oracle

[[Archfey Ethlenn|Ethlenn]] is said to be the seventh elector, although of course it is rare for her to actually cast a vote. Traditionally, the oracles are all powerful warlocks, but in recent years this tradition has not always been maintained.

When an oracle dies, tradition holds that the [[Archfey Ethlenn]] appoints a new oracle. In living memory however, this has not happened. Instead, the remaining oracles elect a new oracle (although by what means, no one knows) and the abstention of Ethlenn is considered her assent.

There are various references and hints in some documents, i.e. [[Letter from the Oracle of the Red to the Mostreve Warlocks]] and a general vibe of 'mysterious' and 'fey', but very little has been made up beyond what is here. 
 
I am also envisioning the oracles as all living in Tafolwern, and perhaps at some level running the city and having the city be their main “power base”… but not sure. I kinda like the division of the monarch as the ruler of all elected by the oracles and the earls the rulers of the land, loyal to Ethlenn first and the monarch second.
