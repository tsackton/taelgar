# Zimka
>[!info]+ Information  
> A culture of the northern highlands of [[Greater Sembara]], centered in [[Zimkova]]

The Zimka are a highland people of the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], whose homeland is [[Zimkova]]. In the tales of their villages, the Zimka came to this land long ago in a migration across the mountains; and in the bogs and lakes of the upper [[Volta]] they found the spirits they call the [[Kestavo|kestavo]].

## Identity and history

In the modern day, “Zimka” is often used as a single name for two closely related cultural strands with a shared identity:

- the [[~Old Zimka~]], a more isolated highland tradition that preserves the oldest ways and the language of [[Languages#~Old Zimkovan~|Old Zimkovan]]
- a broader lowland culture shaped by long contact with river traders and, later, with the expansion of [[Drankor]] and [[Sembara]]; in some places this strand follows [[Mos Numena]] as readily as the kestavo

In the river valleys around the [[Western Gulf]], old stories also remember the Zimka as one of the cultures that emerged from the mingling of the westward-moving [[~Mariners~]] and the older [[~Northerner~]] migrants in the years before [[The Downfall]].

## Language

The oldest Zimka traditions are tied to [[Languages#~Old Zimkovan~|Old Zimkovan]], a Northros tongue. In most of the highland kingdoms of [[Breva]] and [[Ardlas]], however, the everyday speech is usually [[Languages#Zimkovan|Zimkovan]], an Eastros-derived language that carries loan words and echoes of the older tongue.

## Religion

Many Zimka communities follow the [[Northern Folk Religions|small-gods]] tradition in the form of the [[Kestavo]]. In Zimka rites, the kestavo are guides and messengers who carry prayers to the distant creator, and they are central to the customs of burial and remembrance; Zimka funerals are shaped around drawing the attention of a kestavo so that the dead are not lost on the perilous roads of the [[Land of the Dead]].

Zimka lore also warns of malevolent spirits such as [[Zeyfa]], the cruel west wind, and [[Vaqar]], the fire-below—names spoken in the same breath as winter hardship, mischief, and sudden ruin.

## DM notes

- [[Into the Chasm Intros]] includes a hook about a terrified woman, Kalima, emerging from the [[Great Chasm]] speaking “Old Zimka”/Old Zimkovan; her story notes include “seven by seven by seven generations” and a demanded sacrifice each sunset.
- [[Vaqar]] and [[Zeyfa]] include campaign-marked notes suggesting these figures are personifications of dangers encountered during the Zimka migration, rather than literal individual spirits.
