# Vargaldi
>[!info]+ Information  
> A [[~Northerner~]] culture based in [[Northern Green Sea]]

The Vargald, or Vargaldi, are an ancient [[~Northerner~]] culture, sharing a distant ancestry with the [[Deno'qai]] and the [[Zimka]]. The Vargaldi worship the [[Zariya]], small gods that share many similarities with other [[Northern Folk Religions]] such as the [[Tanshi]] and the [[Kestavo]], and speak a language related to [[Languages#~Old Zimkovan~|Old Zimkovan]], but with many [[Languages#Eastros|Eastros]] loan words. Long ago, the ancestors of the Vargald migrated from the west, moving across the [[Svinjo Mountains]], to settle in the [[~Northern Boreal Forest~|vast interior forests]] of the [[Northern Green Sea]], where the Vargaldi have lived ever since. 

With the threat of dragons to the north, and other dangers such as ice worms ever-present in the forests, some Vargald are willing to accept the conditions required for protection from the frost giants of [[Kaldhalla]] or the wizards of [[Ursk]], and a handful of settlements exist along the northwestern borders of Ursk, in particular. Many Vargald have also settled in [[Ursk]], accepting the limitations of the *krev* rite in exchange for safety. 

Those who still eke out a living in the forests, however, rarely build permanent settlements due to the danger of dragons. However, in the winter, as the ground freezes and the summer muds solidify, dispersed bands of a few dozen people often gather in defensible camps, usually nestled in dense forests where attack from the air is more difficult, to guard against the ever-present danger of dragons. 

In addition to hunting and animal herding, many Vargald make a good living trading monster parts to the markets of [[Ursk]], especially at [[Zvervinka]]; others scrape by guiding hunting parties and other adventurers seeking fame, glory, and riches in the wastes. 

The Vargald are particularly known for their unusual religion, worshipping what they call the [[Zariya]] spirits,  and manifesting for many of them as an ability to shape shift into animal spirits, or to call forth their animal protector as a guide and companion. Their connection to these animal guides is central to their culture and art.

The Vargald are also unusual in being a mixed species group. Although [[Humans|humans]] are the most numerous among the Vargald, many bands also have [[Halflings|halfling]] and [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]] that live together in a united community and, uniquely, share the same religion and magic. 

## Names

Although the Vargaldi speak a language related to [[Languages#~Old Zimkovan~|Old Zimkovan]], it has many loan words from [[Languages#Eastros|Eastros]], and many Vargald names sound rather Eastros in flavor. Common male names include Radovan, Torsetn, Rurik, Sindri, Goran; common female names include Mila, Runa, Danica, Zora, Vesna.
