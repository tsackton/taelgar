# The Baz'aku

The Baz'aku are a Deno'qai tribe living on the edges of the [[Elderwood]]. They are known to trade occasionally with the people of the [[Chasa]] River Valley, and some accounts place their traditional lands between the [[Chasa]] and the [[Kayan]].

Much of what is written of the Baz'aku in Chardon comes from the work of the scholar [[Gnaeus]], who spent months living among them and learning their stories and customs.

## Tradition and memory

In the telling recorded by [[On the Lost People of the Forests]], the Baz'aku preserve the shared myths of the Deno'qai: that their people trace their ancestry back to the first humans to leave [[Hkar]], long before [[The Downfall]] and the founding of [[Drankor]]; and that in the oldest days they ranged across vast forests from the mountains to the sea. In these stories, the heart of their “old ways” is the worship of the [[Tanshi|tanshi]], the spirits of the forest who bring prayers to the creator, [[Divine Presence|Anida]].
