# The Baz'aku
*(bahz-AH-koo)*
>[!info]+ Information  
> A [[Deno'qai]] tribe based in the [[Elderwood]], [[Ainumarya]]

## Overview

The Baz'aku are a Deno'qai tribe living on the edges of the [[Elderwood]]. They are known to trade with the people of the [[Chasa River Valley]]. In [[On the Lost People of the Forests]], the Baz'aku claim the land between the [[Chasa]] and the [[Kayan]].

Much of what is written of the Baz'aku in Chardon comes from the work of the scholar [[Gnaeus]], who spent months living among them and learning their stories and customs.

## Tradition and religion

In the telling recorded by [[On the Lost People of the Forests]], the Baz'aku preserve the shared myths of the Deno'qai: that their people trace their ancestry back to the first humans to leave [[Hkar]], long before [[The Downfall]] and the founding of [[Drankor]]; and that in the oldest days they ranged across vast forests from the mountains to the sea. In these stories, the heart of their “old ways” is the worship of the [[Tanshi|tanshi]], the spirits of the forest who bring prayers to the creator, [[Divine Presence|Anida]].

## Economy and way of life

Chardonian accounts and Baz'aku storytelling alike describe the tribe as traders and intermediaries: gatherers of forest wealth—timber, crafted wood, rare herbs, and the products of hunting—who exchange what the Elderwood provides for metalwork and goods from the river towns. The Baz'aku practice careful forestry, keeping small plots of cultivation at the edges of their clearings rather than attempting large-scale farming in the deep woods.

Some recent reports from [[Arendum]] describe an increase in raiding against caravans and forester camps along the forest's margins. These reports have coincided with a more visible Chardonian military presence on the frontier.

## Settlements

Baz'aku villages cluster around a central gathering hall and a green or clearing, often with a well. A shrine or altar to the tanshi—typically a great tree, standing stone, or other natural landmark—serves as a focal point for rites and sacrifices.

Settlements nearer the rivers keep docks for boats and rafts, including large dugout canoes hewn from single trees. Baz'aku villages commonly keep pigs and chickens, and their food is centered on beer and pork.

## Society and leadership

Each village chooses a local chief, with chiefs gathering in council to resolve disputes and, when necessary, agree on matters of war. Surplus is shared between settlements, and formal taxes or tribute are not generally part of Baz'aku governance.

Alongside civil leadership, the godcallers who interpret the will of the tanshi hold significant influence, with informal hierarchies of respect based on perceived closeness to the spirits.

## Recent history

%% Speculative extrapolation generated by AI at user request, based on [[Session 52 (DuFr)]]. %%

In 1748 DR, [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]] was slain in the depths of the [[Elderwood]]. His death weakened the forces that had been spreading corruption through the forest, and news of his deception spread by messenger to the other Deno'qai tribes. Among the Baz'aku, the end of Grimbaskal's influence has sharpened debate over raiding and war, and strengthened those who argue for a return to trade and diplomacy along the [[Chasa River Valley]].

## DM notes

### Overview
 
Historically a tribe of merchants and middlemen, acting as intermediaries between the more isolated forest tribes and the Chardonians. Traded timber, wood products, rare herbs collected from the forests, meat/leather/hide/fur from wild animals. The Deno'qai don't really grow cash crops, most of the animals they raise and the plants they grow are for local consumption - cash crops are harvested from the wilds of the Elderwood.
 
In the past 5ish years, the Baz'aku have shifted to getting much more of their wealth and sustenance from raiding. They especially target merchant caravans that would brave the 500 mile journey upriver from Arendum to trade with the dwarves, and via the dwarves, with Sembara. Also raid forester camps.
 
Has led to Chardonian legions striking back, and there is now a major military presence in Arendum.
 
### Villages / Territory
 
The Baz'aku are not a particularly large tribe -- they occupy about 10 larger villages, each between 50-200 people (see map for territory and locations), and numerous smaller villages, just a handful of families.
 
Most of the larger villages are organized like Raha, from Great Library campaign. A cluster of buildings in the forest, with a central gathering hall and village green / clearing, usually with a well. Livestock mostly pigs and chickens, the Deno'qai do not really use mounts and cattle are difficult to raise without clearing more land. Each village will have some kind of tanshi altar for ritual sacrifices, often a great tree, sometimes a large rock or other standing stone type structure, always something natural. Usually a high-status hut for the Godcaller near the altar. Bulk of settlement will be small cottages, some local industry (butchers, tanners, brewers). Food is generally German-inspired, beer and pork, and usually not very hoppy beer. Agriculture is common, usually on small plots on the outskirts of the village, with trees interspersed. Local forestry is sophisticated.
 
Villages near the river will have docks for riverboats - large dugout canoes cut from single massive trees, and occasionally larger boats used for transport of goods, flat bottomed rafts with a single sail or somewhat more sophisticated.
 
Each village of more than a few people elects a local chief, and these chiefs form a tribal council that chooses one of their own as the chief of the whole tribe. But in general government does not do much, exactly. There is no taxation, for example, and the relationships among villages are fairly socialistic (excess is shared, etc).
 
The most important role of the tribal council is warmaking. At the moment, they cannot agree on full-scale war against Chardon, but individual villages / war leaders have taken it into their own hands to launch raids.
 
Separate from the "civil" tribal leadership, each village has a Godcaller who speaks and interprets the tanshi, and organizes sacrifices as needed. Generally the Godcallers recognize a hierarchy based on closeness to the tanshi / power, and while there are no formal title differences the strongest Godcallers have a lot of sway.
 
Draw inspiration / vibes from the Netflix Barbarians series.
 
### Interactions with Grimbaskal
 
This is the tribe that, when Gnaeus was here, had historically traded with Arendum, been merchants and middlemen between the Deno'qai people and the rest of the world. In the past 20 years, relations with Chardon have significantly soured, driven in part by Chardonian encroachment on Baz'aku territory, primarily for better old growth forest for timber, and in part by Baz'aku beligerence encouraged by Grimbaskal (who goes by Arenga, the spirit of vengeance, among the Baz'aku).
 
Grimbaskal trains giant apes, which he gives to the Baz'aku to assist in their raiding parties. In exchange, they give him tribute from raids, couched in terms of sacrifices to create power, and give promising young warriors into service. These warriors never return, but the Baz'aku are convinced this is a great honor and they are fighting with the gods for justice.
 
There are two factions within the Baz'aku - the war faction and the peace faction.
 
War faction under full sway of Grimbaskal, eager to escalate against Chardon, possessive of the giant apes, and generally believe the Te'kula have fallen into corruption and evil, they are isolationist and will not help with the coming struggle against Chardonian imperialism.
 
Peace faction, the few that remain, are wary of Grimbaskal. They remind the people that not long ago, the Chardonians and the Deno'qai and the Elves were close allies, and without Chardon's might the Deno'qai may have been completely wiped from the face of the Earth. Yes, be wary, watch for signs of imperial aggression, and defend our homes if need be. But if Chardon wants to trade instead of fight, we should embrace that. This faction also believes that the Te'kula are hiding for a good reason, although they are not sure what. Don't agree with the increasing demonization of the Te'kula.
 
### Interactions with the Party
 
In most cases, party should probably be led to the main village / "capitol" when they first meet the Baz'aku. Certainly if they aid the war party, they will be taken to "main" village. Can just narrate this, etc. Hidden paths through the forests, little prayers and burnt leaves as offerings. People dressed in hides, red/blonde hair, sometimes brown, generally worn long. Shields/spears with lots of color on the shields, but covered with dull leather when not in battle. Maybe some with face paint? Mix of skin colors, ranging from pale to olive/brown, but most tended towards a ruddy, light tan complexation.
 
Mostly will be happy to see elf, especially curious about where he is from and if the elves are coming back to the Elderwood ever. Depends of course on exact means of introduction.
