# Deno'qai
>[!info]+ Information  
> A [[~Northerner~]] culture, traditionally associated with [[Tanshi Worship]]

The Deno'qai are an ancient human culture of the western forests and foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]. In their own traditions they are a people of the old migrations from [[Hkar]], and they are closely identified with the intercessory worship of the [[Tanshi|tanshi]], the “small gods” of the forests and wild places.

## Religion

In the Deno'qai tradition, prayers are carried by the tanshi to the creator, whom the Deno'qai call [[Divine Presence|Anida]], “the First and the Last”. The details of ritual, sacrifice, and the work of godcallers are described in [[Tanshi Worship]].

## Tribes and regions

The Deno'qai are not a single polity, but a patchwork of tribes and villages scattered across the forests of the west. Several tribes are recorded in the [[Elderwood]]:

- [[Baz'aku]]
- [[Bek'eni]]
- [[Te'kula]]

Other Deno'qai groups include the [[Northern Tribes]] and their constituent tribes such as the [[Ko'zula]] and [[Shu'anra]].
