# The Bek'eni
*(beh-KEN-ee)*
>[!info]+ Information  
> A [[Deno'qai]] tribe based in the [[Elderwood]], [[Ainumarya]]

A [[Deno'qai]] tribe living in the [[Elderwood]]. The Bek'eni live deeper in the woods than the river-adjacent tribes and make their living as hunters, trappers, and foresters, with only limited agriculture. Bek'eni tradition places special weight on the Elderwood's older and more enchanted reaches, and on the belief that the forest itself can shelter them from the reach of border towns and armies.

Bek'eni oral tradition holds that their tribe long stood closest to the elves of [[Ainumarya]], and preserves stories of hidden elven ruins and old scars in the land where the forest does not return. These tales are recorded in Chardonian sources such as [[On the Lost People of the Forests]].

## Territory and settlements

The Bek'eni are scattered across many small villages and family hamlets in the interior of the Elderwood, about fifteen villages of fifty to two hundred people apiece, alongside denser clusters of small settlements. Bek'eni villages are poorer than those of the [[Baz'aku]], with fewer luxuries and a harsher, more self-contained way of life.

## Relations

Historically, the Bek'eni traded and intermarried with the [[Baz'aku]], and maintained less contact with the towns of the [[Chasa River Valley]] than the river tribes did. In recent memory, they have become markedly isolationist and distrustful of outsiders. Bek'eni rumor often casts the Baz'aku as collaborators who have turned away from tradition, and the deep-forest [[Te'kula]] as a people under a malign influence.

## Recent history

In 1748 DR, the elf called [[Mezzar]] was unmasked at a Deno'qai god tree as the green dragon [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]]. Grimbaskal was slain soon after, and the corruption that had spread through the southern Elderwood began to recede. News of Mezzar's deception was carried to the tribes in part through the work of [[Theba]], a former Bek'eni godcaller. The Bek'eni now reckon with the losses and divisions left behind by Mezzar's rule, including the disappearance of warriors taken into his service and the collapse of village authority built around him.

For decades, the Bek'eni followed the green dragon [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]], who posed as an elf under the name [[Mezzar]]. In 1748 DR he was exposed and slain.  

%% AI note: [[Session 51 (DuFr)]] describes Mezzar as advising the Bek'eni for "the past 10 years", while [[Session 52 (DuFr)]] frames his wider influence as "over the past twenty years or more". %%

## Overview
 
Historically a tribe of hunters, trappers, and foresters, with only a little agriculture. Live fairly deep in the forest, near the stranger / more enchanted areas. Less contact with Chardon, and also less fear of invasion / conflict, as trust the forest to defend them. Once traded with Baz'aku extensively, with considerable intermarriage and flow of people.
 
In their lore, they tell of themselves as the tribe that was closest to the elves, that dwelt in friendship and commerce with the ancient elven cities of the forest. They are the traditionalists of the local Deno'qai.
 
Now, extremely isolationist, and increasingly doubtful of both the Baz'aku who are collaborationists who have turned on tradition, and the Te'kula, who are under the sway of some evil curse.
 
## Villages / Territory
 
Somewhat larger, albeit poorer, than the Baz'aku. Maybe 15 small villages between 50-200 people, plus fairly dense small settlements.
 
The villages follow the same general layout as the Baz'aku, but poorer. Less art/beauty (more given in tribute to the elf Mezzar); less food; more signs of hunger and badly repaired homes.
 
## Interactions with Grimbaskal
 
Grimbaskal goes among the Bek'eni as an elf named Mezzar, a survivor of the Blood Years who needs the help of the Bek'eni to go north and drive the evil out of his ancestral home. Takes warriors, trains them, they don't come back - but seen as an honor and Mezzar talks of their great deeds in the north.
 
This group is most deeply in Grimbaskal's sway, almost worshipping Mezzar. This should feel a bit off to the party so play it up.

This tribe has fallen fully under the sway of Grimbaskal, who goes by Mezzar among them, who they believe is an elf, a survivor of the Blood Years, who has found their tribe and seeks to advise them on how to rebuild and grow. He takes tribute - things of great beauty, things that express the spirit of the forest - and asks only to let the people be his eyes and ears, let him see through them at times, to keep watch. Sometimes he will use this as an opportunity to control people and make them kill themselves, or do something foolish/dangerous, or just cause chaos. He takes warriors to train - although none come back, he says they are needed to protect the tribe. In return he animates the spirits of the trees (actually, corrupts treants) and sends them to guard to Bek'eni.

The Bek'eni have become, under Grimbaskal's influence, extremely isolationist. Often attack intruders in their territory on sight, and bring the captives to Grimbaskal to deal with (Mezzar to them).

There are of course some in the tribe who feel things are going in the wrong direction, but it is hard to argue with an elf who seems to have so much power, and with the fact that Bek'eni villages have not been attacked since the alliance with Mezzar started.

There are some that talk about the Baz'aku as collaborators with Chardon, and there is growing talk of an attack.

They believe the Te'kula to be corrupted by evil, hiding in fear of some monster that in fact controls them.
 
## Interactions with the Party
 
Most likely way to end up among the Bek'eni is to encounter a war party and surrender/go with them.
 
The Bek'eni will treat Delwath as an honored guest (although not let him leave until Mezzar arrives to meet him). Others will be kept tied up / contained, although not necessarily extremely tightly / well-guarded as will by default trust their parole.
 
## Plot Points
 
If they end up here, may just stay to meet Mezzar - if they do, he will tell them to stay for a few days and he will take them deeper in the woods when returns from an errand (but again, this should feel weird/off). Give them every opportunity to escape the Bek'eni without being dragged back to Mezzar's / Grimbaskal's lair, where things will get harder to escape.
 
However, should be one NPC, perhaps the Godcaller (or even better, the former Godcaller who has been "deposed" in favor of someone who now effectively worships Mezzar), who will warn them and could help them escape if needed, and even be their guide to the Te'kula.
