# ~Northerner~
>[!info]+ Information  
> A broad family of early human cultures descended from the first migrations from [[Hkar]], associated with the [[Northern Folk Religions]]

“Northerner” is a convenient name for the earliest waves of human migration out of [[Hkar]]. These peoples left before the rise of later pantheonic traditions, and their descendants are still associated—by custom, story, and shared practices—with the intercessory “small gods” ways of the [[Northern Folk Religions]].

## Origins and spread

Accounts of the northern migrations agree on a few broad features:

- the earliest migrants settled first along the western coasts of Taelgar, and over time spread north
- at some point, some of these peoples crossed the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] in the far north and moved eastward
- in contrast to later Hkaran-derived cultures, Northerner traditions are not generally pantheonic, and arcane magic is remembered as comparatively rare

## Beliefs

Across their surviving descendants, Northerner religion is marked by intercession: local spirits carry prayers to the distant creator, known by many names and understood in many ways. This tradition is expressed most clearly in the three surviving “small gods” strands:

- [[Tanshi Worship]] (associated with the [[Deno'qai]])
- [[Kestavo]] (associated with the [[Zimka]] and their neighbors)
- the [[Zariya]] (associated with the [[Vargaldi]])

## Related cultures

Several cultures are explicitly described as “pure” Northerner descendants:

- [[Deno'qai]]
- [[Zimka]] (including the more traditional [[~Old Zimka~]] strand)
- [[Vargaldi]]

## In Greater Sembara

In [[Greater Sembara]], the old stories of the river valleys remember a meeting of cultures in the years before [[The Downfall]]: the [[~Northerner~]] migrants traveling east from the high passes over the Sentinels, and the westward-moving [[~Mariners~]]. In this account, the mingling of these peoples is part of the background from which the [[Zimka]] and the [[Tollen|Tollish]] culture emerged.

## DM notes

- [[Northerners Territory - DM Notes]] has encounter-ready notes (names, “Germanic tribes” vibe, border concerns, small-gods religion as “a version of the Kestavo”, and a local leader named Hakar).
