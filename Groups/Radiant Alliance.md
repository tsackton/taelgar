The Radiant Alliance was the royal field army assembled by [[Cece I]] in DR 1648 during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|Third Hobgoblin War]]. Formed by combining the Armies of the South and Mostreve and raising a special levy across the realm, the Alliance broke the hobgoblin advance and began the reconquest of southern Sembara.

In the first summer of its campaigning, the Radiant Alliance liberated [[Rinburg]] and [[Cleenseau]] and broke the [[Siege of Dunfry (Third Hobgoblin War)|Siege of Dunfry]]. In the years that followed it continued to push the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] back toward the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], culminating in their decisive defeat in DR 1653.
