The Skullcleaver Clan is a group of hobgoblins based in the northeastern part of [[Irrla]]. A relatively disorganized clan, as far as hobgoblins go, and hemmed in by the fortified and heavily defended borders of the [[Republic of Svolhas]]. The Skullcleavers are largely pirates and raiders; they have significant naval forces, and pose a notable danger to traders sailing from the ports of [[Ursk]]. 

%%^Campaign:none%%
The Skullcleaver clan was not always a major pirate danger. During the late 1730s and 1740s, they have grown considerably as a naval threat, turning to piracy and coastal raids. The exact reasons for this are not yet determined, but it has prompted the Republic of Svolhas to dramatically increase its naval investment over the 1740s.

not canonical details:

Svolhas is bordered to the north and northeast by the rough, rolling hills of the inland, filled with cascading, swift flowing rivers, and challenging terrain to cross, forming a natural barrier. The northeastern border, in particular, is heavily fortified by a line of castles (think the Welsh/English border), because to the northeast of Svolhas lies hobgoblin territory.  About 40 years ago, the Sharktooth Wars ended with the defeat of the previously dominant tribe, the Sharktooth clan, and the expulsion of hobgoblins from the fertile interior of the island, followed by a period of intense fortification to protect the northeastern borders. This has left the remaining hobgoblins -- currently dominated by the Skullcleaver tribe -- to turn to coastal raids and piracy.
