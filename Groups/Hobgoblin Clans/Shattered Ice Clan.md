%% check dm frontmatter makes sense %%
%% I have some notes from sketching out battles where undead would have risen from, and some similar information, mostly about the hobgoblin wars, but that should be reviewed to see if it is relevant here

This does not currently align with [[Discord Chat - Grand Sweep of History]] which postulates that the Shattered Ice Clan is behind all three hobgoblin wars in Sembara, and that the only war that is not them is the [[Sentinel Range War]].
%%

The Shattered Ice Clan emerged from the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] in the aftermath of the [[Great War]], establishing themselves along the [[Enst (South Fork)|South Fork]] and [[Enst (Middle Fork)|Middle Fork]] of the Enst within a generation. They became a growing threat on the border of [[Sembara]] and especially [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], are were a major force behind the [[Second Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|second]] and [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|third]] hobgoblin wars. 

After the end of the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]] they were pushed deep into the [[Sentinel Range]], and although raiders claiming to be aligned with the clan plagued the Sembaran borders for some time afterward, the survival of this clan into the current day is unconfirmed.

%% A few notes from Discord:
* The Shattered Ice Clan was originally more interested in "a place to live" than anything else, and originally wanted Maseau as a human buffer kingdom between themselves and the only somewhat defined "mad scientist" hobgoblins in the northern Plaguelands
* The Second Hobgoblin War, therefore, was one of conquest not destruction, and was inspired by the Shattered Ice Clan attempted to carve out land and habitat for themselves while avoiding conflict with the "mad scientist" clan to the south
* The Third Hobgoblin War, however, was started by the Shattered Ice Clan when it was taken over by a leader with a much more explicit eliminationist goal against humans, and much less interest in a buffer zone with the "mad scientists". The exact identity and motivation of this individual are intentionally left blank

This clan probably has its origins in the northern armies of Cha'Mutte, and likely spent some time after the Great War moving south towards Chardon, only turning east and crossing the Sentinels when the hobgoblin armies were defeated by Chardon. But the exact identity and participation of this clan in those wars is unclear, and they could have turned east sooner. 

However, they were NOT a major participant in the First Hobgoblin War.
