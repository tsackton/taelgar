# The Traveler Thuhr

The Traveler Thuhr is one of the seven traditional [[Dwarves|dwarven]] *thuhr*: institutions of kinship and obligation that bind dwarven society together across clan and kingdom. In dwarven tradition, it is associated with [[Maganna]], the Traveler among the [[Bahrazel|Bahrâzel]], and with those who wander, whether seeking new tunnels and ore deep underground or venturing into the wider outside world.

## Thuhr in Dwarven Life

In the rite of name-taking at the [[Heart of the Mountain]], an adult dwarf receives both a name and a thuhr. The thuhr are a combination of guild, mentorship, secret society, and found family, and a dwarf’s ties to thuhr may be as central—or as incidental—as their ties to clan.
