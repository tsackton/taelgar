# The Runecrafter Thuhr
>[!info]+ Information

> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

The Runecrafter Thuhr is one of the seven traditional *thuhr* of the [[Dwarves]]. In dwarven tradition, it is associated with [[Karthel]], the Runecrafter among the [[Bahrazel|Bahrâzel]], and with the runic arts that are central to dwarven identity.

## The thuhr in dwarven life

In the rite of name-taking at the [[Heart of the Mountain]], an adult dwarf receives both a name and a thuhr. The thuhr are described as a combination of guild, mentorship, secret society, and found family, and they form ties that cross clan and kingdom.

## DM notes

- [[Daruk]] is an example of a historical dwarf explicitly affiliated with the Runecrafter Thuhr, remembered in tales for obsession with lost runic magic.
