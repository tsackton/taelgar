The Priest Thuhr is one of the seven traditional [[Dwarves|dwarven]] *thuhr*: institutions of kinship and obligation that bind dwarven society together across clan and kingdom. In dwarven tradition, the Priest Thuhr is associated with [[Fanrukel]], the Priest among the [[Bahrazel|Bahrâzel]].

## Thuhr in Dwarven Life

In the rite of name-taking at the [[Heart of the Mountain]], an adult dwarf receives both a name and a thuhr. The thuhr are a combination of guild, mentorship, secret society, and found family, and a dwarf’s ties to thuhr may be as central—or as incidental—as their ties to clan.
