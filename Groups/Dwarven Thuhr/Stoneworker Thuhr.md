# The Stoneworker Thuhr
>[!info]+ Information  
> A [[Dwarves|dwarven]] thuhr  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

The Stoneworker Thuhr is one of the seven traditional *thuhr* of the [[Dwarves]]. In dwarven tradition, it is associated with [[Tarbaka]], the Stoneworker among the [[Bahrazel|Bahrâzel]], and with the crafts of stone and the forge.

## The thuhr in dwarven life

In the rite of name-taking at the [[Heart of the Mountain]], an adult dwarf receives both a name and a thuhr. The thuhr are described as a combination of guild, mentorship, secret society, and found family, and they form ties that cross clan and kingdom.
