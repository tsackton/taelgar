# The Order of Twilight

> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

The Order of Twilight is a monastic order devoted to [[The Night Queen]], historically known for hospice and healing. It was once a powerful force across the lands west of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], especially the lands north of [[Lake Valandros]]. It was largely destroyed in the aftermath of the [[Great War]].

In the DR 1730s and 1740s, several dedicated individuals have worked to restore and regrow the Order, led most prominently by [[Galius Filuso]].

## History and Purpose

Founded as a monastic religious order devoted to the liminal work of the [[The Night Queen]], the Order of Twilight tended hospices and death‑houses, protected the dying, and watched over burials and rest. In older accounts they are described as “protectors and guides of those between life and death,” offering safe places to pray, heal, or die as the gods willed.

They were particularly prevalent in [[Amani]] before the [[Blood Years]], with smaller presences elsewhere in to the south and west. The Blood Years shattered the order; only a few pockets endured the destruction of [[Amani]]. In recent years scattered survivors and sympathetic clergy have begun restoring sites and memory of the order.

## People and Sites

- [[Galius Filuso]] — Priest of the Night Queen based in [[Voltara]]. Acts as an advocate for restoring the Order of Twilight in the north; recruited [[Silver Tempests|allies]] to cleanse the ruined [[Order of Twilight Temple (Voltara)]]. Serves as a liaison to the Mos Numena establishment and can speak to the Proconsul on the order’s behalf.
- [[Xameia|Xameia the Forsworn]] — Former paladin of the order bound by a curse after betraying her oaths. Her tomb lies at [[Pykolon Lake]]. She found peace with the aid of the [[Silver Tempests]], after restitution was made through restoration of the Voltara temple.

## Symbols and relics

The order’s holy items are variants on the Night Queen’s crown‑of‑stars sigil. A notable relic, the Twilight Emblem, bears an open hand motif interlaced with the Queen’s symbol. Historical collections note caches of order symbols recovered from hoards and ruins.

See also: The Night Queen page for donation hooks and broader order relations.

Significant in the Great Library campaign, [[Great Library Session Notes - Arc 1]]

Some details are here:
The Temple of the Order of the Twilight:

Session 9 started 4 days after the centaurs; during session 9 they traveled 5 days west, spend 1 day fighting, and traveled 5 days back to Voltara, so it is now 16 days since the centaurs (at the start of session 10).

Backstory: the Order of Twilight was a monastic order of healers and hospice care associated with the Night Queen. They were particularly prevalent in Amani, and were thus heavily impacted by the Blood Years. However, a few small pockets of members survived and the Order is now growing again. Galius Filuso has been scouting, recruiting, and looking for lost Order sites in the North for a while.

Xameia: paladin of the Night Queen who betrayed the Order of Twilight, details in Great Library campaign

Xameia the Forsworn will not be satisfied until restitution is made for her sins. 
There are a bunch of options for this:

1. If the party donates 2,000 gp to Galius Filuso, or to the Night Queen, making it clear this is to help restore the Order of Twilight, Xameia can rest
2. If they find the desecrated monastery of the Order of Twilight which was the scene of the demon battle, clear the demons, and pay for the casting of a Hallow spell (1000 gp material components, 300 gp donation to a priest to cast it), that will also satisfy Xameia and let her rest.
3. If they make a donation to the Night Queen / Galius Filuso but it isn't 2000 gp, may add a quest in addition
4. They could come up with something else, but in general should cost between 1000 and 2000 gp, with amounts on the lower end resulting in also needing some kind of quest / task

If they don't complete this in 30 days, they will start to have nightmares of Xameia. Get about a week of leeway where the only real penalty is loss of downtime, then escalate. Next week is Wisdom saving throws to avoid exhaustion, and the following week Xameia appears to fight them.

Once this is complete, they will have gained an ally in Galius Filuso and the priests of the Night Queen / Order of Twilight, who can speak on their behalf with the Proconsul.

Seems to be part of name, and their of pieces of what might say "Dedicated by Xameia, Protector of Evensong and Dusk Guide of the Night Queen."

On success, portal will vanish, area will begin to heal, and Xameia will rest.
