%% Notes from email

Original idea:
The Oath of the CharitableÂ Wanderer calls to paladins who seek to bring charity and kindness to the whole world through their deeds. The paladins who swear these oaths are dedicated to the ideals of friendship and community across national borders, and are dedicated to the Wanderer's hospitality and welcoming aspects.

Oathsworn of the Charitable Wanderer are likely to be found walking (or riding) the roads of Taelgar, and are particularly welcomed at borders, inns, and cross-roads. They are the particular defenders of refugees, the unjustly exiled, and the homeless.
