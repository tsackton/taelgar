# The House of Entranca
>[!info]+ Information  
> A [[Sembara|Sembaran]] noble family  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

An ancient noble house in Sembara. Historically they claimed to trace their ancestry to [[Willibard the Dragonslayer]], a possibly mythical Sembaran knight, who was said to have slain Azaroth the Accursed, an acid-spitting dragon, said to have terrorized the [[Aine Hills]] after the [[fall of Drankor]]. Chiefly known as the noble house of the first monarchs of Sembara, and obscure and of little importance since the [[Great War]].
