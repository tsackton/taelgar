The Rodnya Voknaz is one of the eight [[Rodnya|rodnye]] that rule [[Ursk]]. Voknaz is based in the western reaches of the country and is known for war magic: shaping elemental forces into destructive spells, and arguing that offensive power is the best defense against the threats of the far north.

The Rodnya’s headquarters is the [[Voknaz Manor]], a heavily warded estate that includes at least one extraplanar portal to the [[Frostfell]].
