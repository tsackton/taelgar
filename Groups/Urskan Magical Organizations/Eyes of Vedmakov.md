The Eyes of Vedmakov, known colloquially as the Watchers or the Okolov, are the secret magical guard of [[Ursk]]. 

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
They were once the ninth [[Rodnya]], known as the Rodnya Okolov. However, after the leader of Okolov made an infernal bargain and betrayed [[Ursk]], taking the name [[Rhodar von Glauer]] and establishing a power base to the west of Ursk, on [[Drachen Peak]], the power of Okolov was broken. Now, the Watchers serve the other Rodnya, and also watch the Rodnya themselves, to protect against betrayals in the future.
