# The Rodnya Zoryana

The Rodnya Zoryana is one of the eight [[Rodnya|rodnye]] that rule [[Ursk]]. It is most closely associated with divination magic: an “uncanny ability to see what is, was, and might be,” and a reputation for finding truths that others would prefer remain hidden.

%% AI note: Sources disagree on Zoryana’s seat of power (Rodnya.md describes them as “based in the center of the country”, while [[Session 94 (DuFr)]] places them “to the southwest”). %%
