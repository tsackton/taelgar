An orc horde that was gathered under the leadership of [[Grumella|Grumella the Vengeful]] in DR 1747. This horde attacked [[Voltara]] in October of DR 1747, and was defeated at the [[Battle of Voltara]]. The survivors of the battle fled, disorganized, into the [[Erbalta Plains]] and the horde as an army ceased to exist.
