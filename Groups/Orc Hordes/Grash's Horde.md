# Grash's Horde

The [[Orcs|orc]] horde commanded by [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]], based out of [[Kharsan]]. This horde formed in the summer of DR 1747, as [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]] began gathering the various scattered minor groups of [[Orcs|orcs]] that had been scratching out a living in the marginal lands of the [[Nashtkar]]. 

These [[Orcs|orcs]] worship [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]] as a demigod of [[Thark]], and most believe fully that [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]] has granted them freedom from death as long as they fight for his cause. 

This horde began constructing a fortified warren a few miles south of [[Kharsan]] in early DR 1748, and marched to war under [[People/Other Nonhumans/Grash]]'s leadership against the [[People of the Rainbow]] based in [[Xurkhaz]] in December 1748, during the [[War of the Cloak]].
