# The People of the Rainbow

The name for the [[Orcs]] of [[Xurkhaz]] who have lived free from [[Thark]]'s curse for many generations. 

## History

The People of the Rainbow trace their origins to the golden age of the [[Drankorian Empire]], more than 1000 years ago, when their ancestors were freed from [[Thark]]'s chains by the gift of an archfey known as the [[Cloudspinner]]. In those days, the People of the Rainbow grew and prospered in the [[feywild]] domain of [[Amberglow]], under the [[Cloudspinner]]'s protection, and safe from [[Thark]]'s reach. 

As they grew in size and power, the People of the Rainbow wished to free their brethren from [[Thark]]'s chains, so with the [[Cloudspinner]]'s blessing and the gift of the [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]] to protect them from [[Thark]]'s power, they ventured back to the material plane. 

Rumors of the unchained [[Orcs]] grew in [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], and eventually attracted the attention of [[Apollyon|Apollyon]], the emperor. In DR 1042, [[Apollyon|Apollyon]] attacked the People of the Rainbow, and the [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]] was lost.

For the next five hundred years, the People of the Rainbow lived a hunted existence, scattered in small groups trying to avoid the ever-watchful eyes of [[Thark]] and the violence of his servants. 

In DR 1582, [[Uzgash]], the leader of a small tribe of [[Orcs]] hiding in the [[Nashtkar]], discovered the long-lost [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]] in a ruined Dunmari fort, and founded the kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]]. The People of the Rainbow have lived in [[Xurkhaz]] ever since, under the protection of the [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]]. Over the years, as rumors of [[Xurkhaz]] spread, lost tribes of the People of the Rainbow hiding in distant places have begun to return when they can. 

Now, the People of the Rainbow are thriving in [[Xurkhaz]], and perhaps in other hidden pockets of the world.
