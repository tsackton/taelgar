The name for the [[orcs]] of [[Xurkhaz]] who have lived free from [[Thark]]'s curse for many generations.
## History

The People of the Rainbow trace their origins to the Golden Age of the [[Drankorian Empire]], when their ancestors were freed from [[Thark]]'s chains by the gift of an archfey known as the [[Cloudspinner]]. In those days, the People of the Rainbow grew and prospered in the [[feywild]] domain of [[Amberglow]], under the [[Cloudspinner]]'s protection, and safe from [[Thark]]'s reach. 

As they grew, the People of the Rainbow wished to free their brethren from [[Thark]]'s chains, so with the [[Cloudspinner]]'s blessing and the gift of the [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]] to protect them, they ventured back to the material plane. 

However, rumors of the unchained [[orcs]] and the [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]] and its power grew in [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], and eventually attracted the attention of [[Apollyon|Apollyon]], the emperor, who attacked the People of the Rainbow, and stole the [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]] for himself. 

For the next five hundred years, the People of the Rainbow lived a hunted existence, scattered in small groups trying to avoid the ever-watchful eyes of [[Thark]] and the violence of his servants. Until after the [[Great War]], when [[Uzgash]], the leader of a small tribe of orcs hiding in the [[Nashtkar]], discovered the long-lost [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]] in a ruined Dunmari fort. Using the power of the cloak, he founded the kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]]. The People of the Rainbow have lived in [[Xurkhaz]] ever since, under the protection of the [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]]. Over the years, as rumors of [[Xurkhaz]] spread, lost tribes of the People of the Rainbow hiding in distant places have begun to return when they can. 

Now, the People of the Rainbow are thriving in [[Xurkhaz]], and perhaps in other hidden pockets of the world.
