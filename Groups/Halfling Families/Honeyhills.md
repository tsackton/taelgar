# Honeyhills
>[!info]+ Information
> A [[Halflings|halfling]] family
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

A family of halfling traders and sailors based in the Nevos Sea. 

%%^Date:1743%%
The Honeyhills' two major trading ships, the Twilight Breeze and the Starlight Bough, which plied the coasts from [[Darba]] to [[Suhaya]], were lost in a tragic storm north of [[Chardon]] in the winter of DR 1743, with few survivors. Many of the Honeyhills who escaped tragedy were subsequently taken in by other halfling ships.
