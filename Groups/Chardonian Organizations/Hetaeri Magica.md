%%SECRET[1]%%

The Hetaeri Magica is one of the most influential magical organizations of Chardon’s academic quarter. It draws members from both the [[University of Chardon]] and the [[Great Library]], and it promulgates rules on the use of magic within [[Precinct IV]].

Beyond the university district, the Hetaeri is also entangled with Chardon’s most lucrative trade. In recent years it has become almost the sole purchaser of refined [[Chalyte]], reselling it onward to artisans and other crafters in the city; this arrangement is a regular subject of rumor and resentment among outsiders who do business in [[Chardon]].
