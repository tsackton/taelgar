The Hetaeri Magica is an ancient magical society, founded in DR 1125 to coordinate rules on the use of magic and magical training between the [[Great Library]] and the [[University of Chardon]], and subsequently growing into one of the most influential organizations in Chardon. In the modern day, the Hetaeri Magica is responsible for safeguarding magical knowledge and regulating the use of magic across [[Precinct IV]], as well coordinating common rules with the imperial Mageguard, the [[Praecanti Vigiles]]. Though the existence of the Hetaeri Magica is not hidden, its membership and governance are not public knowledge. 

Beyond the university district, the Hetaeri is also entangled with Chardon’s most lucrative trade. In recent years it has become almost the sole purchaser of refined [[chalyte]], reselling it onward to artisans and other crafters in the city; this arrangement is a regular subject of rumor and speculation.

Secretly, however, the Hetaeri Magica had been infiltrated by members of [[The Cleansed]], aided by [[Fausto]]'s control of the [[Crown of Purity]] which allowed several key members to be mind-controlled. With the death of [[Fausto]] and the collapse of [[The Cleansed]] in [[Chardon]], this corruption was exposed, revealing that the Hetaeri Magica had maintained control over the [[Chalyte]] trade through coercion and bribery, using the lucrative profits to funnel money into the search for [[Apollyon]]'s relics, among other goals. Now, the Hetaeri Magica and the academic institutions associated with it are in disarray, and it remains unclear what will emerge from the new imperial order represented by the [[Windcallers]], the [[Guild of Chalyte Workers]], and the [[Chalyte Refining Corporation]].

Basic vibe here: The Cleansed use magic (via Fausto) to take over the Hetaeri Magica, and then funnel money (from monopoly control over chalyte) to academics, who happily look the other way and don't think to hard about the background. Fausto uses this to build up the [[Society of the Open Scroll]] and hire a bunch of adventurers (some true believers, some dupes) to try to find the Scepter and the Cloak for Apollyon. 

The Hetaeri Magica was the fulcrum of the whole thing, the organization that had the clout to orchestrate the chalyte bribery and corruption, the ability to deceive the imperial bureaucracy, and the connections to launder money into the academic centers. 

It is still unclear exactly how this will play out into DR 1750 and beyond. Formally, the Hetaeri Magica still has a lot of power on paper, but the membership is scattered and disorganized, and possibly there is no longer a quorum to do new business (between mental breaks from mind-controlled people and Cleansed true believers fleeing).
