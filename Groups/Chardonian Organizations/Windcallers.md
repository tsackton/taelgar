# The Windcallers

The Windcallers are chalyte‑empowered navigators in service to the [[Chardonian Empire]]. They pilot ships through the narrow, windless reaches of the [[Old Chardon Canal]] and are widely credited with making Chardon’s navy the most feared on the [[Endless Ocean]].

The Windcallers are based in [[Nevium]], near the canal mouth, and are treated as a special case within the chartered monopolies that regulate refined [[Chalyte|chalyte]], being guaranteed by charter the right to purchase a fraction of refined chalyte production at fixed rates. How, exactly, they use this [[chalyte]] is a mystery revealed only to initiates. 

%%^Date:1750%%
As part of the reorganization of the chalyte monopolies and the creation of the [[Chalyte Refining Corporation]], the Windcallers have taken on a more prominent role in the city of [[Chardon]] and the chalyte trade. With the backlash against the [[Hetaeri Magica]] for their perceived role in [[Fausto]]'s rise to power and the chaos that followed, the Windcallers are increasingly seen, especially by the Magistros [[Mitus Verina Auratan]] and his allies, as the most responsible chalyte users in the [[Chardonian Empire]].

The details are not fully developed except in vague thoughts, but the basic vibe is that the Windcallers were historically purely a navy organization, who developed some way of using chalyte to power wind and water magic. They think this is safe; whether it truly is, or just less dangerous than other uses, is TBD. This should feel mysterious - it is a secret society, after all. 

What they do is not wizard spells in the traditional sense, probably more akin to storm sorcery or something. While some Windcallers are powerful mages (e.g., [[Tiberius]]), many are not: while they could summon and control wind they might not even be able to cast a cantrip. 

Politically, they are functionally a non-entity prior to the rise of [[Mitus Verina Auratan]], and probably don't even really have a presence in Chardon. Most people would think of them, to the extent they know anything about them, as the weird canal wizards. 

During the early years of Mitus' reign, when Fausto was in control of the chalyte trade, they were intentionally kept marginalized as much as possible by the [[Hetaeri Magica]], although several powerful Windcallers became close advisors to the Magistros. It was not until Fausto's downfall and the crisis of legitimancy of the [[Hetaeri Magica]] that prompted that the Windcallers burst onto the political scene in Chardon. Starting around DR 1750 they have a much more significant presence in the city itself.
