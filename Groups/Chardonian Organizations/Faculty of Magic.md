The Faculty of Magic is one of the five graduate faculties of the [[University of Chardon]]. Its masters train and credential advanced practitioners of the arcane arts, and their teachings shape much of Chardon’s reputation as a city of wizards and scholars.

The Faculty of Magic is intertwined with other institutions of the academic quarter. Many of its members also participate in organizations such as the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], and the university as a whole is closely affiliated with the [[Great Library]] and the [[Hetaeri Magica]].
