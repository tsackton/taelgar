# The Faculty of History

> A faculty of the [[University of Chardon]]  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

The Faculty of History is one of the five graduate faculties of the [[University of Chardon]]. It is among the principal authorities in Chardon on the chronology and legacy of the [[Drankorian Empire]], and its teachings shape how many Chardonian scholars speak of conquest, empire, and “civilization”.

The Faculty is known to treat [[Chronicles of Drankor]] as a standard reference on Drankorian chronology. Other works about Greater Chardon note that its historians present the [[Western Wars]] as an imperial mission that brought safety to dangerous lands—an interpretation not universally shared beyond Chardon.

## DM notes

- [[People/Chardonians/Gnaeus.md]] notes that Gnaeus “failed to gain appointment to the Faculty of History” and now lives in poverty as a tutor; this may be useful as a social hook for Chardon academic politics.
