The army of the Chardonian Empire.

%% WIP: Tim needs to flesh out various pieces of information in my head and in various DM planning notes %%

The Chardonian Legion is the standing army of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. It garrisons forts across the imperial frontier and is the instrument by which the empire enforces its borders and projects power.

In the wake of [[Grumella's War]], the legion is recorded as leading raids from northern forts to break the disorganized remnants of [[Grumella's Horde]]. Chardonian military power is also closely tied to [[Chalyte]], which is said to fuel the feats of the legion’s war wizards.
