Sybil's Hall is a lectum, one of the undergraduate organizations that make up the [[University of Chardon]]. It is one of the oldest lecti of the University, founded in DR 981. Historically, Sibyl's Hall was among the most powerful and well-funded lecti, supported by a variety of religious patrons in the name of [[The Sibyl]]. Since the [[Great War]], Sibyl's Hall has seen its fortunes decline, and it is now heavily dependent on undergraduate tuition for support. 

Sibyl's Hall occupies a prime location in the center of the University, controlling a small quadrangle with a central yard, student rooms, a bar, lecture halls, a refectory, common rooms, and a temple of the Sibyl. However, most of these buildings are in poor repair, due to declining funds, and Sibyl's Hall  has seen better days.
## Lecturers
- [[Gnaeus]], a talented but disgraced historian and scholar
