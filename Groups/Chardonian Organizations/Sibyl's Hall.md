Sybil's Hall is a lectum, one of the undergraduate organizations that make up the [[University of Chardon]]. It is one of the oldest lecti of the University, founded in DR 981. Historically, Sibyl's Hall was among the most powerful and well-funded lecti, supported by a variety of religious patrons in the name of [[The Sibyl]]. Since the [[Great War]], Sibyl's Hall has seen its fortunes decline, and it is now heavily dependent on undergraduate tuition for support. 

Sibyl's Hall occupies a prime location in the center of the University, controlling a small quadrangle with a central yard, student rooms, a bar, lecture halls, a refectory, common rooms, and a temple of the Sibyl. However, most of these buildings are in poor repair, due to declining funds, and Sibyl's Hall  has seen better days.
## Lecturers
- [[Gnaeus]], a talented but disgraced historian and scholar

%%Old Notes from OneNote

The University of Chardon consists of, in addition to the higher faculties, a few dozen lecti (singular: lectum) and halls that are the basis of undergraduate education. Usually the halls are associated with various external orders, whether gods or something else, while the lecti are patronage based, although this is not a perfect rule.

Sybil's Hall is one of the original colleges of the University, founded in DR 981, and for a long time it was one of the most powerful and well-funded of the colleges. However, since the Great War many of the religious orders of protection and defense that flourished in the west have fallen in power, and patronage has declined, so many of these places now are heavily dependent on tuition and often are falling into disrepair.

Sibyl's Hall is no exception. Sitting in a prime location in the center of the University, and controlling a small quadrangle with a central yard, student rooms, a bar, lecture halls, a refectory, common rooms, and a temple of the Sibyl. However, most of these buildings are in poor repair, and the Hall is in a downward spiral, unable to attract the best tutors and thus unable to attract the best/richest students.

Gnaeus has a small apartment in the apartments here, just two rooms with a sitting room and a sleeping room, both small and cramped.

He is relatively easy to find - probably have the party find him as he is finishing a recitation.
