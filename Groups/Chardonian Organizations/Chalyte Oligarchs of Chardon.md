# Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon

Four major families control the entire [[Politics of Chalyte (Chardonian Empire)|Chardonian chalyte trade]]: the [[Auratan Family]], the [[Patelios Family]], the [[Caloren Family]], and the [[Veldari Family]]. These families operate as vertically integrated, closely held trading companies, with each family owning their own mines, transport, and refineries.  

The four families work together, both openly and presumably secretly, to ensure that they retain control over the sale of refined chalyte. While the families must compete amongst themselves for relative influence and position, they outwardly present a unified front that ensures the control of the chalyte trade remains in their hands.
