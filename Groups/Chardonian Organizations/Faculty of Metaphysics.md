The Faculty of Metaphysics is one of the five graduate faculties of the [[University of Chardon]]. It is concerned with supernatural and planar studies: the ordering of the cosmos, the nature of echo realms, and the principles by which scholars attempt to describe the stranger parts of creation.

Its models and classifications, such as the [[Standard Multiversal Model]], are widely taught across Chardon’s scholarly world.
