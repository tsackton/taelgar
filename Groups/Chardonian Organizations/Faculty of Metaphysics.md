# The Faculty of Metaphysics
>[!info]+ Information  
> A faculty of the [[University of Chardon]]  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

The Faculty of Metaphysics is one of the five graduate faculties of the [[University of Chardon]]. It is concerned with supernatural and planar studies: the ordering of the cosmos, the nature of echo realms, and the principles by which scholars attempt to describe the stranger parts of creation.

Its models and classifications are widely taught across Chardon’s scholarly world. The [[Standard Multiversal Model]]—used in works such as [[Spiritual Realms]]—is explicitly associated with the Faculty, and other writers note its influence in how the university names and categorizes realms like the [[Feywild]].

## DM notes

- [[Dunmari Frontier - Session 48]] describes [[Ulfgar Frostbeard]] as a professor on the Faculty of Metaphysics, and calls [[Galen]] “a professor of experimental metaphysics”.
- `_dm_notes/_Great Library/Arc 4 - Boss Monsters/Dragon (Session 51-56)/GL - Session 56 - DM Notes.md` and `_dm_notes/_Great Library/Arc 4 - Boss Monsters/Beholder (Session 57-60)/GL - Session 57 - DM Notes.md` both describe Galen as “on the Faculty of Metaphysics”, and show him purchasing elemental materials for study.
- `Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Letters and Notes/Research about Ancient Sources on Limbo.md` describes [[Gaius Devarro]] as “an early scholar at the Faculty of Metaphysics”.
- Possible inconsistency to review: [[People/Chardonians/Galen.md]] lists affiliations including [[Faculty of Magic]] in frontmatter and lead text, but multiple session/DM sources place him in metaphysics.
