The Imperial Chalyte Mining Company was proclaimed by [[Mitus Verina Auratan]] in DR 1749, as an imperial charter with monopoly rights to prospect and extract [[chalyte]] in the [[Chataan Mountains]]. The charter followed the reassertion of imperial control on the range’s northern slopes, after the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] destroyed the stone giant tyrant [[Dhrukmir]].
