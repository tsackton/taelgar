The Dunmari mystery cults are magical, semi-secret organizations dedicated to the worship and service of the [[Five Siblings]], as well as associated demigods. 

While the existence of mystery cults is well known, the exact magic and practices of each cult is generally kept secret. 

The more prominent ones include:
- [[Aagir Mystai]], known as the Aagiri, who patrol the roads of Dunmar and keep the land safe by might of arms. 
- [[Sonkar Mystai]], who can see the truth of things and are often called to resolve disputes of justice
- [[Lakan Mystai]], who keep the secrets of Dunmari history, and also study the secrets of metaphysics and the multiverse
- [[Shakun Mystai]], who magically defend the eastern borders of the [[Dunmar]].
- [[Order of the Awakened Soul|Bhishma Mystai]], known as the Order of the Awakened Soul, who preserve the stories of the Dunmari people

Rumors tell that the Chidya Mystai can turn into animals, and that the Jeevali Mystai know the secrets of life and death and resurrection, but like many rumors it is not clear if these are true or not. Whether the demigod Adra, whose domain is secrets and outcasts, has a mystery cult, none will speculate.
