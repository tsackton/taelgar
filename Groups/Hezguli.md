# Hezguli

> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

The Hezguli are a community of [[Orcs|orcs]] who were born under the sway of [[Thark]]’s curse, but freed from it as children or young adults. They have learned—often with difficulty—to live as free orcs. They are most closely associated with General [[Murook]], widely regarded as their unofficial leader.

%% this is supposed to have vibes kind of like a support group for orcs rescued from Thark in childhood or young adulthood, a kind of mix something like AA and a fraternity and a mutual aid society %%
