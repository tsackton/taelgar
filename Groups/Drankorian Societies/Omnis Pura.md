# Omnis Pura

Omnis Pura is a Hkaran supremacist organization dedicated to the proposition that it is only the pure blooded children of ~HkarUrbanCultureElite~ that are destined to control the world.

Associated with the winning side of the [[Drankorian Civil War]], and played a prominent role in the later history of the [[Drankorian Empire]]. [[Apollyon]], ithe last Emperor of the [[Drankorian Empire]], was supposedly a supporter. 

Re-emerged in [[Chardon]] some time after the [[Great War]].
