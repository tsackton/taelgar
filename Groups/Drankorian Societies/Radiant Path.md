# The Radiant Path

The Radiant Path was a clandestine movement of priests and lay followers in [[Drankor]] during [[Apollyon]]’s reign. Its members sought to preserve older rites and resist Apollyon’s imposed “official” worship, organizing secret networks of aid and escape for those persecuted in the capital.

The best‑known surviving artifact of the Radiant Path is the [[Book of Martyrs of the Radiant Path]], a hidden memorial record kept by its priests, preserving the names and brief life stories of those who vanished or were taken.
