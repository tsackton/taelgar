The Ashen Cloaks were the name given to the agents and enforcers who carried out disappearances and killings in [[Drankor]] during [[Apollyon]]’s reign. In the surviving accounts of the [[Radiant Path]], they are remembered as the hands that took dissidents and the faithful on storm‑lashed nights and left no trace behind.
