The Fides Lucaris were a Drankorian secret society associated with the Emperor [[Helea]] and the losing side of the Drankorian civil wars. In the surviving historical record, they are best known through scattered notices of executions and exile when members were caught; these notices also suggest the Fides Lucaris were a cross‑species alliance, involving at least humans and elves.
