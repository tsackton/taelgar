The Windcallers are chalyte‑empowered navigators in service to the [[Chardonian Empire]]. They pilot ships through the narrow, windless reaches of the [[Old Chardon Canal]] and are widely credited with making Chardon’s navy the most feared on the Endless Ocean.

The Windcallers are based in [[Nevium]], near the canal mouth, and are treated as a special case within the chartered monopolies that regulate refined [[Chalyte|chalyte]]: even when other buyers must negotiate through the [[Hetaeri Magica]], the Windcallers are guaranteed access to a fraction of refined production.
