Shadowkeep was the base of operations for [[Rhodar von Glauer]], a vampire lord who ruled a significant area on the north coast of the Green Sea, west of Ursk and east of Skaerhem. 

Constructed with infernal magic on the top of [[Drachen Peak]], the Shadowkeep served as a place of respite for vampires under the control of Rhodar von Glauer, and the center of his power. 

It was destroyed in DR 1749 upon the permanent death of [[Rhodar von Glauer]] at the hands of the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], as the infernal magic that sustained the structure of the keep was tied to Rhodar.
