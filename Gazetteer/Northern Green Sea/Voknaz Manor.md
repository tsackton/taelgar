The Voknaz Manor serves as the headquarters of the [[Rodnya Voknaz]]. Located in western Ursk, the manor is protected by extensive magic. It houses at least one extraplanar portal, to the [[Frostfell]]. 

The inner keep sits on a small artificial lake, surrounded by a permanent wall of fire. The entire complex is surrounded by a wall of stone; a number of support buildings and other structures are located on the shore of the lake, and are used to entertain visitors, among other things.
