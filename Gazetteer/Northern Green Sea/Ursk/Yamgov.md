# Yamgov

Yamgov is an interior city of [[Ursk]], the commercial center of the fertile [[Dalinka]] River valley. Grain fields and pastures stretch for miles around the walls, dotted with windmills and riverland hamlets. The [[River Market]]—a sprawling series of stalls along the riverbanks—serves caravans and barges alike, moving produce east toward [[Vedmakov]] and west toward outlying estates.

Unlike the fortified frontier at the western border, the farmlands around Yamgov are less intensively patrolled by the [[Eyes of Vedmakov|Okolov]], so long as travelers keep to the main road and avoid restricted compounds. In winter, when fields are quiet, gossip and small ventures fill the time in the hinterlands; in planting and harvest, the roads are crowded with carts and hired hands.

The city’s role in Ursk’s food economy makes it a natural waypoint on overland journeys, especially for those avoiding the strongest Okolov scrutiny in the interior administrative cities. Even so, transit papers are wise to carry, and the main crossings of the Dalinka are watched.
