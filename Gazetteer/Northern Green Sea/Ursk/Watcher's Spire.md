# The Watcher's Spire

The Watcher’s Spire rises above [[Zvervinka]]’s upper city, a fortress‑tower of rune‑scribed stone serving the [[Eyes of Vedmakov|Watchers/Okolov]]. More than a symbol, the Spire functions as a seat of training and oversight for those who guard Ursk against supernatural threats. Its wards glow faintly by night, and its halls are said to contain a modest archive of reports, maps, and occult references relevant to frontier defense.

Visitors—when admitted—are required to deposit detectable magic in sealed chests at the entry vestibule, a practice intended to keep the tower’s inner sanctums free of stray enchantments. Formal hospitality within the Spire is austere but precise: tea is served, interviews are structured, and business is conducted with attention to the safety of the city beyond the tower’s doors.

From the market quarters along the [[Ket]] to the gatehouses of the lower city, the Spire’s presence is a constant reminder that [[Zvervinka]] stands where civilization meets the wild. While many citizens view the Watchers with respect, a few grumble at their secrets and influence; nonetheless, in winters when ice‑spawn and worse press downriver, the Spire’s wards and messengers are decisive.
