# Vedmakov

Vedmakov stands at the headwaters of the [[Leis]] in interior [[Ursk]], a strategic hub on the overland route between the Ket basin and the western grainlands. Renowned—and feared—as the namesake seat of the [[Eyes of Vedmakov|Okolov]], the city exercises rigorous control over arcane practice and travel. Patrols on the roads and river approaches are disciplined and methodical; transit papers are routinely inspected, and contraband magic is confiscated without ceremony.

Topographically, Vedmakov sits amidst rolling farmland cut by river valleys that funnel trade east and west. Caravans bound for [[Yamgov]] often skirt the city rather than attempt entry, following maintained roads across tilled fields and low ridges. The city’s inner districts are said to house archives and administrative halls of the Okolov, though such places are seldom seen by foreign eyes.

The watchfulness that defines Vedmakov’s character has a practical origin: much of Ursk’s internal magical infrastructure—wards, courier relays, and counter‑draconic measures—traces back to the Okolov’s work here. Consequently, while the city is less hospitable to casual visitors than [[Zvervinka]] or the coastal ports, it is integral to Ursk’s governance and defense.

Meta/DM notes and campaign interactions:
- Referenced across travel notes in [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 95 (DuFr)|DuFr 95]] (road choice, patrols, bypassed en route to Yamgov); see also [[Letters and Notes/Philosopher's Information Concerning Ursk|Philosopher’s guidance]] (hopeless to infiltrate).
- Practical: road checks by Watchers; archival presence within the city; common to pass without entering when traveling west.
