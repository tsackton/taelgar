Zvervinka is a major market city in interior [[Ursk]], set along the lower [[Ket]] not far from the [[Green Sea]] coast. Heavily fortified and vigilant, it anchors the trade in trophies and reagents of the far north—dragonhide, ice‑worm scales, remorhaz matter, and other dangerous spoils—moving goods downriver and along the coast to [[Praznitsky]] and [[Zakat]] for export, or overland toward [[Vedmakov]] for domestic use.

## Setting and Layout
Zvervinka stands on two levels: the lower city along the marshy fens of the Ket, and the upper city on the hills above. The lower wards crowd the riverbanks and gates, where timber yards, warehouses, and a tannery district just downstream mark the city’s working edge. A broad thoroughfare from the gates to the central market, known locally as the Dalitza (“the Street”), carries most caravan traffic. The Icebound Dockyards handle seasonal river navigation when spring and summer waters rise.

The upper city is dominated by the Great Hall and the rune‑scribed [[Watcher's Spire]], with craft districts nearby. Alchemists’ Alley and the smiths and armorers that specialize in northern wares cluster around the market plazas; Dragon’s Plaza displays a preserved white dragon’s head, a reminder of the city’s peculiar commerce.

## Trade and Economy
Zvervinka’s economy turns on the monster‑part trade, with timber and furs as secondary pillars. The city depends on food shipments from the south, supplementing with game in the warm months and preserves for winter. Sellers entering the gates present wares for inspection and pay a market tax—often in kind or gems—after which officials issue papers enumerating goods permitted for sale. The market operates daily but is busiest on Wednesdays and Saturdays for rare and esoteric materials. River traffic is highly seasonal; when the Ket runs low or freezes, warehouses and overland routes carry the load.

## Magic, Law, and Security
Unlicensed spellcasting is prohibited inside the walls. Those authorized to work magic do so under recognized papers associated with Ursk’s [[rodnya]] orders, and the [[Eyes of Vedmakov|Watchers]] patrol markets and gates to enforce compliance. At the [[Watcher's Spire]], formal audiences require depositing detectable magic at the entry vestibule. In winters when the wild presses downriver, the walls remain fully manned and wards are closely tended, while the magic of the [[Rodnya]] protects the city.

Meta/DM notes and campaign interactions:
- Featured across [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 94 (DuFr)|DuFr 94]] and [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 95 (DuFr)|DuFr 95]] (market dealings, Silver Wolf, Watcher’s Spire protocol; letters of transit). See also [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Hoards/Gifts and Purchases#In Zvervinka|purchases in Zvervinka]].
- Color and layout (Session 95 DM Notes): lower city along the marshy [[Ket]] (cold/damp winters; hot, buggy summers), with novja quarters against the walls; tannery district just downstream. The main thoroughfare from the gates to the market is the Dalitza (“The Street”). Upper city is dominated by the Great Hall and the [[Watcher's Spire]]; nearby are Alchemists’ Alley, smiths/armorers, inns, and taverns. The Icebound Dockyards handle seasonal river traffic. Dragon’s Plaza features a preserved white dragon head; the stables sit just inside the south gates.
- Economy and trade: monster‑part trade is primary; timber and furs secondary. City depends on food from the south; some game in warmer months and preserved for winter. Gate practice for sellers: show goods and pay tax (often in‑kind or gems), then receive paperwork enumerating permitted wares; market busiest on Wednesdays and Saturdays (Session 94 DM Notes).
- Law and magic: unlicensed casting is strictly enforced by the [[Eyes of Vedmakov|Watchers/Okolov]]. Only those with recognized rodnya papers may cast. Spies/informers are common. At the Spire, visitors deposit detectable magic at the entry vestibule before audience (DuFr 94 notes).
- People and places of interest (DM notes):
  - [[The Silver Wolf]] (Roman’s high‑end inn; gossip hub). River’s Maw tavern near the docks (sailors/novja; trophy‑lined walls). The Veiled Bazaar (hidden market for forbidden/rare goods). The Frostforge (Anya Svetlanova’s chill‑warded blacksmith for anti‑monster gear). City Archives (record access via Natalia Zhukova). Alchemists’ Alley stores; Dragon’s Plaza; Icebound Dockyards.
  - Notable figures met or prepped: [[Lena Sorokina]] (Watcher), [[Roman]] (innkeeper), Fyodar (gate guard); plus a roster of merchants, crafters, and novja community contacts in Session 94–95 DM notes.
- Social context: “novja” are Vargaldi who underwent the krev rite to bind with Ursk’s magic; those outside the krev receive little aid and face added risk. Anecdote: a young dragon ignored krev‑bound townsfolk and attacked novja—Watchers then destroyed it (apocryphal, used in‑world as cautionary lore).

Religion - NOT CANON

- Religion: The people of Ursk largely follow a religion that has a vibe kind of like deism in the early modern period of the real world, but with a little bit more formal organization and a focus on meditation/introspection as a way of connecting with the Creator God, who is seen not so much as non-interventionist but rather as intervening via granting magical powers to people who are able to channel their inner connection to the divine. So there are perhaps temples and things like that, but not regular church services or anything. The novja, however, while many follow this religion, also have a second secret religion that some follow, based on worship of animal spirits called Zariya
- Tishanja Zal (The Hall of Silence): the largest of several meditation halls in Zvervinka. Usually pretty quiet, mostly modest and unassuming architecture, with thick stone walls and stained glass in abstract patterns.
