Zvervinka is the principal market city of interior [[Ursk]], set along the lower [[Ket]] not far from the [[Green Sea]] coast. Heavily fortified and vigilant, it anchors the trade in trophies and reagents of the far north: dragonhide, ice‑worm scales, remorhaz matter, and other dangerous spoils. Goods move downriver and along the coast to [[Praznitsky]] and [[Zakat]] for export, or overland toward [[Vedmakov]] for domestic use.

The city stands on two levels: the lower wards by the marshy fens of the Ket, and the upper city on the hills above. Dominating the skyline is the [[Watcher's Spire]], seat of the Watchers (Okolov) in Zvervinka. Foreigners are admitted under strict rules, but the city is more welcoming than most Urskan strongholds, owing to its role as a trading nexus with the [[Vargaldi]] and other northerners.

Markets along the river bustle in season with merchants, hunters, and negotiators bartering for rare materials. Artisan houses in the upper city support this commerce—alchemists, armorers, and smiths—while inns like [[The Silver Wolf]] serve those with deep purses. In winters when the wild presses hard down the Ket, the garrison and the Watchers keep the walls manned and warded.
