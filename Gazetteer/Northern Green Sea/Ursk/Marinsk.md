# Marinsk

%%2nd easternmost of the trading cities%%

Marinsk is a coastal city of [[Ursk]] and one of its three principal trading ports, alongside [[Zakat]] and [[Praznitsky]]. The [[Sovo]] River runs through the city, dividing harbors and districts before reaching the [[Green Sea]]. Despite foreign docks maintained for commerce, Marinsk is cautious toward outsiders; visitors typically remain confined to the port precincts unless they possess proper papers or trusted sponsorship.

Compared with the larger ports, Marinsk’s foreign quarter is smaller and—by reputation—less saturated with the vigilance of the [[Eyes of Vedmakov|Okolov]]. Traders speak of discreet opportunities to move goods upriver, though the Okolov’s presence is never absent for long. Within the city, Urskan culture and law prevail: magic is strictly controlled, and unfamiliar customs can draw unwelcome attention.

Economically, Marinsk serves as a conduit for riverine produce and coastal trade, balancing merchant pragmatism with the strategic caution characteristic of Ursk’s northern polities. The safer approach for cautious travelers is usually by water along the Sovo, where traffic and the river’s breadth make observation less certain than on the fortified roads.

Meta/DM notes and campaign interactions:
- Source: [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Letters and Notes/Philosopher's Information Concerning Ursk|Philosopher’s memorandum on Urskan cities]] (foreign docks, Sovo approach, Okolov caution); see also [[Ursk]].
- Practical: smallest foreign port among the three; Sovo bisects the city; Okolov surveillance concentrated at docks and gates.
