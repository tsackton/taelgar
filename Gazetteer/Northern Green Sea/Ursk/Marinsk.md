# Marinsk

Marinsk is a coastal city of [[Ursk]] and one of its three principal trading ports, alongside [[Zakat]] and [[Praznitsky]]. The [[Sovo]] River runs through the city, dividing harbors and districts before reaching the [[Green Sea]]. Despite foreign docks maintained for commerce, Marinsk is cautious toward outsiders; visitors remain confined to the walled port district unless they possess proper papers. 

Like all of the coastal ports in Ursk open to trade, the port district is watched by the [[Eyes of Vedmakov|Okolov]]. But compared with the larger ports, Marinsk’s foreign quarter is smaller and—by reputation—less vigiliantly guarded, and some traders speak of discreet opportunities to move goods upriver. Within the city, Urskan culture and law prevail: magic is strictly controlled, and unfamiliar customs can draw unwelcome attention.

Meta/DM notes and campaign interactions:
- Source: [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Letters and Notes/Philosopher's Information Concerning Ursk|Philosopher’s memorandum on Urskan cities]] (foreign docks, Sovo approach, Okolov caution); see also [[Ursk]].
- Practical: smallest foreign port among the three; Sovo bisects the city; Okolov surveillance concentrated at docks and gates.
- 2nd easternmost of the trading cities
- DM notes indicate this is the "cultural" city but don't add anything about what that might mean.
