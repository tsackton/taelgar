The Svinjo Mountains, called the Hrimthur by frost giants, form the great eastern barrier of [[Vostok]] and the southern rampart of the [[Northern Green Sea]]. Long ridgelines of granite and gneiss march north–south, riven by high passes and glacier‑scoured cols. In winter, whiteout snows sweep the saddles; even in late spring, cornices and avalanche chutes render travel perilous without local guidance.

Historically, the Svinjo have sheltered many peoples on their lee slopes and in their hidden vales: dwarven holds and stoneborn enclaves are said to lie in the deeper fastnesses, while scattered human steadings cling to the forested foothills. The giants themselves long maintained a high kingdom known as [[Kaldhalla]], whose fortunes waxed and waned with the dragon flights of the far north. Legends remember frost‑giant rulers who held pact‑roads safe and offered sanctuary to travelers so long as the old laws were kept.

The great passes are gateways between worlds of climate and culture. To the west lie Vostok’s plains and riverlands; to the east, the vast [[~Northern Boreal Forest~|boreal forests]] and the hard frontiers of [[Ursk]]. Trade caravans and monster‑hunters alike choose their crossings with care, for the mountain winds carry more than snow: remorhazes hunt the high ice, and white dragons claim the loftiest aeries. Nevertheless, the Svinjo remain the surest inland route for those avoiding the fortified coastal roads and the eyes that watch them.

In Vargaldi tradition, the Svinjo mark the ancestral migration line: their forebears crossed these ranges into the deep woods, where they dwell to this day. Urskan travelers speak of way‑shrines and stacked stone markers in the lee of buttresses, testifying to the enduring, if precarious, human footprint along the trails.
