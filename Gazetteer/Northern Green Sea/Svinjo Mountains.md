The Svinjo Mountains, called the Hrimthur by frost giants, form the great eastern barrier of [[Vostok]]. Long ridgelines of granite and gneiss march north–south, split by high passes and glacier‑scoured cols. In winter, whiteout snows sweep the saddles; even in late spring, cornices and avalanche chutes render travel perilous. 

To the east of the mountains, the vast [[~Northern Boreal Forest~|boreal forests]] of the [[Northern Green Sea]] stretch for hundreds of miles. The source of the mighty [[Ket]] is in these mountains as well, flowing east through the forests to the distance [[Green Sea]]. 

Historically, the Svinjo have sheltered many peoples on their lee slopes and in their hidden vales: dwarven holds and stoneborn enclaves are said to lie in the deeper fastnesses, while scattered human steadings cling to the forested foothills. The giants themselves long maintained a high kingdom known as [[Kaldhalla]], whose fortunes waxed and waned with the dragon flights of the far north. Legends remember frost‑giant rulers who held pact‑roads safe and offered sanctuary to travelers so long as the old laws were kept.
