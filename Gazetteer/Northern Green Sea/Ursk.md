# Ursk
>[!info]+ Information
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`

Ursk is a secretive civilization on the north coast of the [[Green Sea]]. Rumors are that it is a land of wizards and magic, of ice and snow, of monsters and secret treasure. While outsiders are allowed to trade at a handful of port cities, including [[Zakat]] and [[Praznitsky]], the warehouses and docks of these cities are kept isolated from the city proper, and foreigners are not allowed to pass the borders. Trade with Ursk, however, is worth the hassle, for the valuable hides, furs, and other monster parts, especially the most prized of all, dragonhide from the northern wastes.

Ursk itself lies largely on the lowland coastal plains, south of the highlands and plateaus that extend all the way west to northern Vostok and the Sembara Highlands. The winters are long and cold, and the westerly winds off the [[Green Sea]] bring snow from October to May. But the short summers are pleasant and the long days of June and July make some agriculture possible. Much like the central plateaus of Vostok, this is a land of many small, cold rivers, and with the maritime influence wetlands are common, especially along the coast. To the north, the vast taiga of the northern wastes extends are far as one can travel, until it is replaced by tundra in the higher elevations and the far north.

The people of Ursk speak their own tongue. Common is rarely spoken, although the trade tongue of the far east, Eastros, is more common. None speak Sembaran or any tongue of the western isles. 
## Rumors

The northern coasts between Skaegenland and Ursk are inhospitable, with few or no safe harbors, generally sheer cliffs and rocky coasts, and no ports. Who or what lives there is anyone's guess, and no one has ventured into the interior and returned. But many rumors fly:
- The Last Kingdom of the Giants
- Fierce snow elves
- Shapeshifters and changelings
- A hidden kingdom of wizards who fled the destruction of Drankor
- A kingdom of wild folk led by a queen who can turn into a massive winter wolf at will
- The kingdom of giant eagles
- A dense cold forest of talking trees who attack and kill any wooden ship that attempts to anchor
- The secret kingdom of a vampire who snacks on unwary sailors

%% NOTES, FROM GOOGLE DRIVE

On the northern shores of the [[Green Sea]], stretching a few hundred miles along the coast and extending inland, lies a civilization ruled by wizards. A closed culture, foreigners are restricted to a few offshore islands on the outskirts of coastal trading cities, where they trade for prized furs and hides, especially dragonhide, of the northern wastes.
### Climate

Ursk  lies largely on the lowland coastal plains, south of the highlands and plateaus that extend all the way west to northern Vostok and the highlands of  [[Zimkova]]. The winters are long and cold, and the westerly winds off the [[Green Sea]] bring snow from October to May. But the short summers are pleasant and the long days of June and July make some agriculture possible. 

The land rises gradually to the north, and the northern edge of Ursk  is defined by the rough, rugged mountains of the [[~NorthUrskMountains~]]. Much like the central plateaus of Vostok, this is a land of many small, cold rivers, and with the maritime influence wetlands are common, especially along the coast. To the north, the vast taiga of the northern wastes extends are far as one can travel, until it is replaced by tundra in the higher elevations and the far north.

(the basic idea is roughly the northern parts of Atlantic Canada, perhaps with a bit more snow; or maybe the southern/coastal parts of Siberia - long winters, cold but modulated by the ocean, a fair bit of snow, warm short summers, and mostly forest/boreal swamp ecosystems)
### Geography

Ursk is dominated by its coastal cities. The vast majority of the population lives within 50 miles of the coast, and the only major population centers are here, including the four “trade cities” with ports at which foreigners are allowed to dock. Among the most prominent of these is [[Praznitsky]], in the western part of the country. The interior of Ursk is sparsely populated, and contains no large cities and few towns.
### Culture and Politics

#### The Krev rites and the Rodnya

The people of the Ursk are intimately connected with magic, through the krev and the rodnye system. 

The krev is a ritual that is required of everyone when they reach adulthood, which binds each citizen of Ursk together as a wellspring of magical energy. Undergoing this ritual enhances innate magical ability, and innate arcane ability in particular – there are many more wizards, and especially sorcerers, in Ursk than one would expect based on its size. The magical wellspring of the populace of Ursk, bound together, also allows the mages and wizards of the country, when connected to this energy, to enhance their magic, a crucial factor in the defense of the country against the dangers of the wild north. But the krev is not without cost. Those bound to it occasionally lose chunks of time, a few hours usually, that they cannot later recall. 

Ruling over the krev system and Ursk are the eight rodnye (bloodlines, loosely; singular rodnya), each one a loose confederacy headed by a powerful mage. Each rodnya is individualistic, not familial, and membership is not by inheritance. Instead, it is by nomination/invitation. While the focus of the rodnye is often on magical training and knowledge, and all magic users are eventually expected to join a rodnya, other prominent people (and sometimes random people of no particular prominence, perhaps when a rodnya has a magical intuition or foretelling about someone) can be invited to join as well. 

Joining a rodnya involves three rituals. First, one takes the zakava (pledge), marking one as a member of a rodnya, but not compelling further advancement, and at this stage some people can (and do) shift alliances. Some members are eventually invited to take the laj (oath), which marks you as a significant person in the ranks of your rodnya, and finally the zvia (binding), which magically binds you to compel loyalty to your rodnya. An invitation to advance in in your rodyna is the same as a command - it isn't like if you are invited to the zakava ritual you can say no. 

For those who truly do not wish to join, the rodnye are merciful  -- exile is an option, as long as you are willing to suffer the rasaka first. The details of the ceremony are mysterious - for none who undergo it are allowed to remain in Ursk. But it is known that is severs the part of you bound by the krev, leaving it behind in Ursk while you depart. For magic users, this destroys their ability to cast spells; for others, rumors claim it makes you sick, although to what extent, and how quickly ones recovers, is never clear. 

(What if the metaphysics is that it isn't just a seal but a redirection of some sort? So the rasaka actually allows the rodnye to continue to draw whatever magical power they previously would have from the person. Perhaps it is actually draws more power, in some way, at the expense of the victim's health (mitigated, if they have spellcasting ability, for that is what 'fills up' the bond) -- but for those without magic ability, the ritual is still used before exile, and it leaves the exiled lethargic, weak, tired, sickly, etc. Some people take the bargain (and perhaps, to some extent, it isn't always clear exactly what the bargain is). But the cost is real.)

Through these rituals – the krev system, the rodnya rites, and the rasaka – the rodnye maintain a monopoly on magical use in Ursk. And there are rumors that the heads of the rodnye bind themselves to each other with even more powerful rituals than the zvia. Although there is always disagreement and jockeying amongst the lower ranks, the leadership of each rodnya appear to always reach consensus with each other without conflict. 
#### The People of Ursk

Most people in the Ursk have been here for many generations, dating back hundreds of years before the Great War. The rodnya trace their origin to the great coastal cities of Ursk today, many of which have an ancient history. Outsiders are neither welcomed nor usually tolerated, and immigration and emigration are mostly unheard of. This is largely because of the krev. Those who are bound to it are not allowed to  leave without suffering the rasaka, and the krev ritual fails if attempted after a certain age, so only those who immigrate as children can be fully incorporated into the Ursk 

However, during the disruptions and upheavals of the Great War, in the course of wars agains the terrors of the northern wastes, Ursk conquered the inland region, incorporating the people living their into the krev and society. 

These people, call the novja (loosely, new people), still have not, for the most part, fully integrated into society, and they often live in a separate ghetto or on the 'wrong side of town'. Prominence and advancement is rare, and as they have been connected to the krev for only a few generations, magic use seems particularly uncommon amongst them. Thus, few of the novja pledge rodnye, and none advance to the laj or zvia. This leaves them somewhat marginal, and there are occasional debates within the Ursk, even now, as to whether they should be truly citizens or if perhaps they should be formally segregated. The novja are often accused (sometimes correctly) of being not fully committed to the krev and the rodnya, and are sometimes suspected of avoiding their obligations to the krev, hiding their children from the rite. This leads to mistrust, especially when the dangers of the north increase in salience. 

### Recent Events

Over the past decade, the question of the novja has divided the eight rodnya. One of the rodnye, the Rodnya Kinzal, is particularly known for their dislike of the novja. Another, Rodnya Voknaz, is known for their pragmatism and is particularly concerned with Various Dangers Up North, rather than squabbling over who is or isn't a citizen. Voknaz has been the most open to novja, especially those who show strength of arms.

The winter of 1748 was a particularly dark and dangerous one. A dragon of ice and snow arose far in the north, stronger and more dangerous than many such beasts, and the early forays against this creature failed to stop it. The winter stretched long into spring, unnaturally so, and armies of walking ice were spotted moving south. A novja, Artem Novolozek, ended up as the leader of an elite squad sent to kill this creature. Success would likely have been a major coup for the factions that want to more closely integrate the novja... but he fails. He flees south ahead of disaster, the only survivor of the battle, and the dragon is only defeated by several of the very powerful mages - heads of the rodnye - band together. In the wake of this disaster, questions are raised: Why was Artem, who has not been through the zvia, even sent? Is anyone even sure he participated in the krev as a child? 

In the fallout of this near-disaster, Artem vanishes.

Notes from GDrive, might not be accurate:
- East of Skaegenland
    
- Land of long, hard winters, short summers, Russian in climate, but slightly modulated by Green Sea
    
- Possible mageocracy with ancient roots, maybe associated with dragons or giants
    
- Possible closed cities - trade missions outside, no outsiders in, but also considering same for western islands west of Chardon
    
- Remnants of old ‘east northlander’ people, relatively uninfluenced by Drankor
    
- Different language, religion? (or maybe Eight Divines still?) If different religion, use the “old gods” of highlands?
