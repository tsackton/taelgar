# The ~Northern Boreal Forest~

A vast belt of taiga, muskeg, and river‑laced lowlands, the Northern Boreal Forest runs from the lee of the [[Svinjo Mountains]] toward the [[Green Sea]]. Long winters, brief riotous summers, and broad, cold rivers dominant the land here, lending the forest an austere beauty.

## Terrain and Geography
A vast boreal woodland stretches for hundreds of miles east from of the [[Svinjo Mountains]] across taiga, muskeg, and river‑laced lowlands. Drumlins and low moraines shape long lines of spruce and larch; between them lie peat bogs and black‑water ponds. Great rivers such as the [[Ket]] gather snowmelt and wind toward the [[Green Sea]], while innumerable creeks braid through willow flats and beaver marsh.

## Climate and Seasons
Winters are long, dry, and severe; snow hardens into wind‑sculpted crust and lake ice booms at night. Spring arrives in a rush: thawed rivers run high and fast, tracks turn to mire, and the air fills with mosquitoes and midges. Summers are short, bright, and blooming; autumn comes early with frosts that redden dwarf birch and drop cones from the high spruce.

## Ecology
The flora of the boreal forest varies with hydrology and soil: black spruce and tamarack over muskeg, mixed spruce‑birch on better soils, and hardy pine on sandy ridges. Cranberries, cloudberries, and reindeer lichen carpet the knolls while sedges and cotton‑grass fill the wet flats. Alder and tall willow tunnel the riverways, where elk browse, raptors ride thermals over open glades, and dusk owls work vole runs as fish push upstream with the thaw. 

Beneath the muskeg, massive ice worms swim the permafrost, heaving the ground into wind‑packed wormbacks and glazing rime‑lined tunnels that breathe pale mist on winter nights. Ambush predators, they burst forth from the frost to swallow their prey - anything that walks the ground -- whole. 

Above all, white dragons rule the highest aeries, hunting river corridors and open taiga,  stooping anything that moves. Dragon breath fuses wet bog to season‑long frostglass and scours favored grounds into bleached dragon fields. 

## Peoples 
People are sparse in the forests, though the deep woods are home to a northern peoples, the [[Vargaldi]], whose ancestors crossed the Svinjo into these reaches. Camps shift with season and game, with few permanent buildings due to the danger of dragons. What camps last are usually hidden in deep forests, out of sight of flying eyes. While the hardships of the land keep population densities low, those who learn to hunt the dangerous inhabitants of the northern forests can make a tidy profit at the markets of [[Zvervinka]].

ChatGPT: LONG version of ecology

Canopy species vary with drainage: black spruce and tamarack over muskeg; mixed spruce‑birch on better soils; hardy pine and juniper on sandy ridges. Understory cranberries, cloudberries, and reindeer lichen carpet the drier knolls; sedges and cotton‑grass dominate the wet. Along river corridors, alder and tall willow create green tunnels that shelter elk, bear, and the smaller hunters that shadow them. Raptors ride the thermals over open glades; at dusk, owls hunt the vole runs edging the bogs. Fish runs pulse upriver with the thaw, and carrion beetles and ravens mark the forest’s constant exchange of life for life.

Beneath the muskeg, massive ice worms move through the permafrost like ships through dark water, their passage heaving the ground into long, wind‑packed hummocks locals call wormbacks. In deep winter they travel slowly and silent, sheathing their tunnels in rime that exhales as pale mist at night; in thaw they surge, collapsing bogs and leaving glass‑edged sinkholes where they surface to feed. Molted scales the size of shields are found along old burrow‑chimneys—blue‑white, cold to the touch even at noon—and fetch a price with alchemists who prize them for bindings against heat and venom. Hunters listen for the “sunground,” a subsonic thrumming that precedes a migration front, and set ward fires on ridgelines to divert a herd or save a camp.

Over and above all, white dragons hold the highest aeries on the Svinjo faces and the frost‑fangs nearer the interior. They hunt along river corridors and over open taiga, driving herds into kill‑gulches and stooping on ice worms when their backs break the crust—two titans whose clashes leave swathes of shattered timber and blown snow called dragonfalls. A dragon’s breath can fuse wet bog to frostglass that lasts a season, and the repeated scouring of a favored hunting ground leaves bleached “dragon fields” where the canopy dies back and only willow and cotton‑grass return. Where dragons range hard, ice worms keep to depth; where dragons thin, the worms’ surfaceings become more common, and the land heaves and settles as if it remembered waves.
