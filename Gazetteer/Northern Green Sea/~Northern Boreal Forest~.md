The Northern Boreal Forest is the vast inland woodland of the [[Northern Green Sea]], stretching from the lee of the [[Svinjo Mountains]] across an expanse of taiga, muskeg, and river‑laced lowlands. It is sparsely settled by outsiders and home to a tapestry of northern peoples, most notably the [[Vargaldi]], whose ancestors crossed the Svinjo long ago and made the deep forests their refuge.

Winters are long and severe; summers brief and full of insects and bloom. Great rivers such as the [[Ket]] and the [[Beyil|White River]] gather the snowmelt and bear traders, hunters, and raiders toward the sea. In the interior, small camps and osseri move with the seasons, while at the margins trappers and way‑villages keep uneasy ties with the cities of [[Ursk]].

Legend holds that the high days of [[Kaldhalla]] saw giant wardens patrol the forest margins and battle white dragons to keep the roads open. In later centuries, the balance of danger and commerce shifted, but the old stories remain: spirits in the glades, ancient stones on drumlins, and long barrow mounds where frost never truly leaves the soil.

For northerners like the Vargald, the forest is a homeland with its own internal maps: routes of kinship, shrine‑ways to the [[Zariya]], and safe crossings known by memory rather than mark. For southerners, it is a place of rumor and risk, better skirted unless guided by those who belong to it.
