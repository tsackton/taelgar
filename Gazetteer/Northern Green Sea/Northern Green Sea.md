## DM Notes and Meta

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The culture of [[Ursk]] is well developed, although there are a number of blank spots in the history. The [[Vargaldi]] are also reasonably well developed, although generally only in broad strokes. This area has a significant frost giant presence, in [[Kaldhalla]], and the conflict between frost giants and white dragons has substantially shaped some of the details of the wilderness here. Canonically there are established dwarven and stoneborn cultures in the [[Svinjo Mountains]], but no details are invented about these peoples. The existence of a vampire kingdom on the western borders of Ursk is canonical, although the fate of this region after the interventions of the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] has not been determined. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* In general, this region is assumed to be largely wilderness, and dangerous, outside the developed regions, but details are somewhat vague, especially along the coast to the west of Ursk, which is canonically dangerous but whether something beyond vampires lurks here is undetermined. There is plenty of room for additional oddities and dangers in this region, and the coast west of [[Ursk]] is relatively undeveloped. This longer term history of this region is largely blank, except for recent history of Ursk and ancient history of the Vargaldi. However, the region as a whole is largely complete from a vibes perspective, so new development needs to conform to the existing overall design of the region. 

*Needs Development:* The history of [[Ursk]] is relatively poorly developed, especially prior to the Great War; the origins of the Urskan people are not canonically determined, although these are presumed to be mariners of some kind. The religion of Ursk is unclear, although divine magic is exceedingly rare among Urskans. The history of [[Kaldhalla]] before [[Vimfrost's War]] is only weakly sketched.

*Intentionally Blank:*  None.

*Adventures:*  The Ursk arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign traveled extensively across this region, including to [[Kaldhalla]], the [[~Northern Boreal Forest~]], and [[Ursk]],

*Important Places in Staging:*  [[~North Ursk Border Mountains~]]
