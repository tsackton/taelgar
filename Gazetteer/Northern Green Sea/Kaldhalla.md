Kaldhalla is a frost giant kingdom on the northern slopes of the [[Svinjo Mountains]], known as the [[Svinjo Mountains|Hrimthur]] to the giants. It is an ancient kingdom, founded long before humans settled the Green Sea, but since [[Vimfrost's War]] and the death of [[Bjarnfrost]] the Mighty, Kaldhalla has shrunk compared to its former glory. While once the might of Kaldhalla protected much of the [[~Northern Boreal Forest~]] from the dragons and other dangers of the north, now, the frost giants rarely leave their mountain strongholds. 

Under the rule of King [[Brimskarda]], the giants of Kaldhalla have come to dominate the cultures of the northern [[Svinjo Mountains]], and many dwarves and stoneborn exchange labor, sometimes hard and difficult, for the right to live in the protected steadings of the giants.

The largest and strongest of these, and Brimskarda's chief fortress, is [[Isenborg]].
