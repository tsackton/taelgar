### Dwarven Fort at Raven's Hold

A dwarven fort and trading post in Raven's Hold. In better days, this was a major trading outpost, iron mine, and forge, serving as a point of communication and trade between the dwarves from the southern part of the central mountains and the Dunmari. While the Brawnanvils had a major presence here, numerous other clans either lived or spent time here, including the Strongaxe, Boulderbeard, Redpeak, and Deepcavern clans.

Abandoned during the [[Great War]] when the dwarves here fled south in the face of mind flayer attacks.

#### History of the Outpost

In better days, this was a major trading outpost, iron mine, and forge, serving as a point of communication and trade between the dwarves from the southern part of the central mountains and the Dunmari. While the Brawnanvils had a major presence here, numerous other clans either lived or spent time here, including the Strongaxe, Boulderbeard, Redpeak, and Deepcavern clans.

Since the outpost was abandoned by dwarves, it sat empty for many years. While the hobgoblins had control of the Dunmari fort, the dwarven stronghold was occupied as a defensive fortification but never lived in or explored. After the hobgoblins were driven out and the fort fell under the sway of the border defenses, it sat empty for many years.

Gradually, creatures of the deep dark crept into the abandoned spaces, establishing lairs in places where they could hunt and find prey or food. Slowly, a few thralls (grimlocks and derros) of the mind flayers in the deeps, crept up here, some to escape and live in peace, others as spies on the outside world.

Grimlocks and derros are creatures created in the image of humans and dwarves by mind flayers, to be their worshippers, servants, thralls, and slaves. Most of them worship mind flayers, and feel their purpose is to grow stronger, acquire slaves and treasure, and find their mind flayer overlords again. A few, however, are "atheists" who just want to live in peace and quiet. The derro tend towards paranoia and madness, while the grimlocks are fervent cultists, or in the case of those who have rejected the mind flayer cult, scared and timid.

The leader of this group, more or less, is a derro savant named [[Inakara]] who believes her powers are a gift from the mind flayers, and is devoted to their worship. However, she is also relatively pragmatic and willing to make a deal with a powerful group if it can get her something she wants. The biggest thing she wants is for the Roper to be killed; since the demon appeared a few weeks ago, little now wanders into its lair from the outside and so it has taken to attacking derro and grimlocks that it used to largely leave in peace (they would often hunt prey at night and leave offering for it). One way or another she will try to use the PCs to kill the roper, either by asking them to in exchange for safe passage, or knocking them out, letting them recover tied up, and then throwing them in the cavern with the roper. If the PCs let on they are looking for treasure or a particular item, she will lead them to the vault in exchange for 50% of the treasure they find (she has not been able to pass the defenses of the vault). Depending on what they find and what they bring out, she may turn on them and attempt to take more, but only if she thinks she can defeat the party.
