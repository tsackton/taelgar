### Eudomes' Tower

The tower of the Drankorian wizard [[Eudomes]], with an ancient elvish history. Now the center of an endless lightning storm caused by the mad storm giant [[Hralgar]]. 

%% Notes

Eons ago, lost in the dawn of time when the Firstborn walked the earth and the great empires of giants and dragons and other creatures of myth and legendÂ  stretched across the world, great skyships of the storm giants sailed the skies. While a few may remain in distant hidden corners of the world, or travel the skies of other planes, many crashed or were destroyed.

One such skyship, the Star on the Wind, Vindristjarna (vin-dree-st-jar-na), crashed on what is now the Dunmari plains thousands of years ago. Since then, it has been a beacon of sorts for storm giants that remain in the land.

During the height of the elvish kingdoms that ruled during the Age of Magic / Age of Dawn, a tower was built upon the prow of the wrecked skyship. The Elenil, those close to Elmerca, Wild Star, took to this place in particular, calling to the storms that would gather and learning the messages and wisdom of ancient storm giants that passed by, and most especially those who had passed on from their humanoid form.

The world turned, and the elves retreated, and humans spread across the land. The Drankorians soon found the crashed skyship and the tower built upon its prow, and studied the ancient magics within. During the time of the [[Drankorian Empire]], scholars relearned some of the Elven magics for communicating with the storm giants, especially the quintessents who, once in a generation, would drift across the plains as a thunderstorm or tornado or a monsoon rain.

Towards the end of the [[Drankorian Empire]], the tower became the base and outpost of [[Eudomes]] Stormcaller, a powerful Drankorian mage who wanted to control the power of the weather. A bit of a renegade and outlaw, he devised an elaborate magical mechanism, powered by the ley lines centered on Stormcaller Tower, to bind and trap storms themselves, harnessing their energy for magical works, and ultimately hoping to restore the skyship below somehow.

A few years before the fall of [[Drankor]], his nets caught [[Hralgar]] Skaldjotendur, an elder storm giant quintessent, who was passing in the form of a wild thunderstorm. Drawing on the power of the storm, [[Eudomes]] became a significant player in the late [[Drankorian empire]], while earning the emnity of [[Hralgar]] . When the plague struck, [[Eudomes]] died, but Hralvgr could not completely free himself, and the tower was abandoned.

For many centuries, there [[Hralgar]] remained, trapped. With the fall of [[Drankor]], knowledge the Stormcaller Tower was lost. The Dunmari knew it as a landmark, and also a place to be avoided, a place of strange magic and wild weather. To them, this place was called Pavantova, the Tower of Wild Wind.

About a month ago, three Chardonian treasure hunters entered the tower and made their way to the top floor, where they found the mechanism of [[Eudomes]], and attempted to recover it for the [[Great Library]]. There efforts were only partially successful, and they released Hralvar , but only partially, and he has awoken but without fully returning to consciousness and control. He is lost in a dream state, lashing out, and thinning the boundary between the [[Dreamworld]] and the mortal realms here. So not everything is as it seems.
