### The Monastery of Bhishma

A monastery complex dedicated to [[Bhishma]] about 2 1/2 miles south of [[Kharsan]]. Houses the [[Hall of Stories]], the records of the Dunmari people. 

### Description

The monastery complex is sitting on a bluff near a turn in the river. The southern edge is cliffy as it drops down to the river floor, while the west is a gentle slope down to the river, formerly a thriving garden and farm for the monastery. There is a newer path with a few stone steps that has been constructed from the dry river bed up the slope, and the remains of stairs cut into the side of the cliff. Here can be found the remains of the old [[Bhishma]] mystai settlement.

Because of the slope of the land, the temple is the most prominent building from any direction, with the tower attached to the hall of archives also notable. The one story cloisters and kitchens and the baths and workshops sit low and are less notable architecturally (from the outside, at least). The two dormitories, with space for several hundred monks in residence, are elegant three story buildings, but don't reach as high as the temple or the hall of archives.

%% Notes

About 2 1/2 miles south of [[Kharsan]] on the east side of the (now dry) river.

The monastery was founded about 150 years after the country of Dunmar came to be, originally consisting of just the cloister building and the larger dormitory building, with the baths added soon after.

As the Mystai grew in influence and [[Bhishma]] became acknowledged as a god, the public temple was constructed over the next generation or so, and soon after the second dormitory was added as the cult grew.

Finally, a few hundred years before the [[Great War]], [[Bhishma]] spoke to the monks and told them to build an archive, a way to store the history of her people, to keep alive the souls of the country ahead of the great battle to come and the doom of the Dunmari. Over the next ten years, the archive and tower were constructed.

During the [[Great War]], the monastery was well protected by the terrain and the garrison at [[Kharsan]], which was defended as a critical spiritual resource. After the war, however, the inexorable spread of [[Cha'mutte]]'s Plague could not be stopped, and [[Kharsan]], which had survived the war largely intact, suffered tremendously.

The mystai of [[Bhishma]] could do nothing to stop the plague. Most fled, taking relics of [[Bhishma]] and whatever they could carry from the monastery. Some stayed, desperately building final defenses to keep the secrets of the monastery safe after they were taken by the plague.

For many years, the wastes of the [[Plaguelands]] kept curious adventurers away, and the last defenses of the monks kept wandering beasts from disturbing the monastery. As orc hordes and hobgoblin nations moved in, looting [[Kharsan]], the monastery remained protected by these defenses and the watchful eye of [[Bhishma]], aided occasionally by Mystai of the Awakened Soul.

In the 1570s, after the Bitter Knife Wars, a small group of Mystai sought to reclaim the monastery. The haunting of the Plague Years lay deep upon it, and the nightmares of the plague deaths could not be easily cleansed. But they set up a small camp on the other side of the river, and began to expand the [[Hall of Stories]], adding tales of the years after the [[Great War]]. This continued, in ebbs and flows, until 1717, when the Order and [[Rai]] attempt to heal the land and failed.

After this, the protections weaken, and the plague haunting grows stronger, as the power of [[Bhishma]] in the world is diminished without her champions. Slowly some beasts and other things start to creep in, disturbing the dead.

In the past year, starting in 1747 with [[Grash]] obtaining the Ring of the Undying, the situation has changed dramatically. [[Grash]]'s power extends the haunting effects from the city itself to the monastery, and with his protection the orc troops can enter and loot the buildings (at least some of them; some of [[Bhishma]]'s protections still stand). One of the major goals of the orcs -- beyond stealing whatever treasure remained -- is to defile the place. This has meant that some of the dead now wander, soulless abominations, and other evil creatures from the [[Shadowfell]], drawn to the power of the place, linger to haunt it.

So, the feel:

-Mostly intact, and what damage there is is very recent. Things like unearthed graves, etc are all recent as well.

-Some areas looted, again recently; some protected.

-Monsters: [[Shadowfell]] and spirit undead; ghouls and similar corporeal undead; ghosts and other spirits protecting the sacred treasures; perhaps a desert beast of some kind has made a lair? Perhaps some orcs keeping watch?
