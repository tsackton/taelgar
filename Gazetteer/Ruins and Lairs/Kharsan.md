### Kharsan

Once a major Dunmari city, now a ruin controlled by the undead warrior [[Grash]]. 

Set on the banks of the now-dry river [[Kharja]]. Much of the city, especially the northern sections, are in complete ruins. However, the palace square and the administration complex around it remain standing, as does the old stadium in the southern part of the city. 

Across the river from the city are cliffs on which stand two lines of massive monuments, north and south of the road. These are the Samraat Tombs, monuments to the rulers of the first dynasty of Dunmar, the [[Aatmaji dynasty]]. 

Although of varying sizes and designs, all share some common architectural features:
-   Five sided step pyramids / ziggurats, with steps/"arms" reaching out from the main base
-   A statue, temple, pyramid, something on top of the complex
-   A chapel/burial chamber underneath

## History

#### Phase 1: Pre-Dunmar

Before Dunmar, Kharsan was never a very important place. There was no Drankorian river crossing here, and there was no real town or settlement here, perhaps a small farming village or the like.

However, after [[Drankor]] fell, a small community grew up here as there was a decent harbor and decent farming, just north of the edge of the worst of the plague affected areas. The cliffs above the river on the west provided some protection to the west. A minor manor town, its name lost to history, grew here, defended by a fort where the Samraat Tombs now stand, and pledging fealty to a minor barony on the [[Kharja]] river that grew out of the fall of [[Drankor]]. However, when the Dunmari came, these people were slaughtered en masse, as one of the first acts of the Dunmari was to sweep north up the [[Kharja]] river valley as it sprung to life with [[Jeevali]]'s rains.

Little remains from this earliest era, however.

#### Phase 2: Aatmaji Dynasty

The spot where [[Bhishma]] prayed to bring back [[Jeevali]] was supposedly just four miles south of here, and although it was not in a spot with good river access, a monastery grew there, dedicated to the Mystai of [[Bhishma]], and soon a city grew around Kharsan. This became the spiritual and administrative home of the [[Aatmaji dynasty]], starting from a few monuments and a palace complex and growing into a more substantial city.

During this time, the city grew and most of the major landmarks were constructed.

#### Phase 3: Decline and the Great War

With the fall of the Aatjmaji dynasty, Kharsan lost some of its centrality to Dunmari culture. The central government administration functions moved west during the Dharajun Dynasty, and Kharsan became more of a pilgrimage and religious site than anything else. Much of the former palace fell into disuse, although not quite disrepair, but the monastery and the Samraat Tombs kept this as an important religious site.

During the [[Great War]], Kharsan took on new life as a military headquarters, and the barracks section in town was developed/re-developed. Parts of the palace were re-used as general's quarters, the stadium was reconstructed and refurbished, and the walls and docks were repaired/upgraded.

#### Phase 4: Cha'mutte's Plague and the Aftermath

Kharsan suffered significantly during the [[Blood Years]]. The Dunmari population universally fled or died from the plague, which settled heavily on the city. For a decade, no life could be found here.

As the deadliest phase of the plague cleared, Kharsan was left an empty shell, haunted by the dead. Since then, parts of Kharsan have been destroyed in a few events.

First, Mavdyr and his orc horde crossed through Kharsan, bringing down the eastern walls and much of the city around the old East Market, which remains the most ruined and broken part of town. But they did not stay as Mavdyr could feel the curse on the land.

Second, the Bitter Knife clan establishes something of a civilization along the [[Kharja]]. Again, because the cursed and haunted nature of Kharsan, no one lives here. But the Bitter Knife spend considerable time looting the treasuries of Kharsan as best they can, and also cart of significant quantities of stone and other material north. They attempt to desecrate the Samraat Tombs and the Temple, to mixed success.

After the defeat of the Bitter Knife tribe in DR 1576, Kharsan sits empty for 40 years, falling into disrepair. The occasional beast or monster passes through, but the haunted curse that lays on the land keeps any from lairing here.

#### Phase 5: Rediscovery by the Order of the Awakened Soul

In the DR 1610s, the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]] is active in the Blasted Plains, and rediscovers their lost monastery. Because of the haunted nature of the land, they cannot reoccupy it, but regular missions move through, and the Order does what they can to restore the monastery, the Samraat Tombs, and the palace/temple of Kharsan. To do this they, in part, raid the stones of the rest of Kharsan, driving it further into disrepair.

For 100 years, the Order keeps an eye on things, and little changes. However, in the 1710s, the Order suffers a great defeat trying to help [[Rai]] remove the curse on the land. Many die, and those that remain are weakened and know little of the former power of the order. The monastery and Kharsan are abandoned. During this time, the Orcs of the Burning Sun Horde arrive, but few venture into Kharsan as it remains haunted. Still, like others before them, expeditions to recover treasure and take stone for building further degrade the city.

#### Phase 6: Grash the Blighted

In 1747, about 9 months ago, [[Grash]] the Blighted arrived in Kharsan with the Ring of the Undying and a good portion of [[Apollyon]]'s orc servants, who now call themselves the Undying Horde.

[[Grash]] established himself in the ruins of the palace, repairing walls and buildings as much as possible with orc aid. He quickly brought the chaotic undead of the city under his control, and has insisted they no longer bother orcs. This has meant that some orcs have moved into the barracks/stadium area.
