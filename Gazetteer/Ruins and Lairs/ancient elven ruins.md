### Ruined Elven Workshop

Under the [[Lakan Monastery]] is the ruins of an ancient elven workshop, which is located on a weak point where the energy of [[Arborea]] leaks into the material plane. 

%% Notes
Thousands of years ago, when Dunmar was a great elven forest, there was a low hill where the [[Lakan Monastery]] is now, and at the center of the hill was a place where the connection to the outer plane of [[Arborea]], a place of wild, uncontrolled nature, was particularly strong.

The elves dug a cave system to protect and study this place, tending the strange creatures that would spring from the planar weakness, and guarding the outside world from the unrestrained influence of [[Arborea]].

When the elven kingdom fell, this place fell into ruin, and was lost, the entrance collapsed.

During the [[Drankorian Empire]], this region around [[Tokra]] was recognized as a place of strange magic, and several forts were constructed to defend the road and travelers from potential extraplanar threats. A small Drankorian trade outpost, a walled city, and a river crossing grew up, mostly to provide safety, but was never densely populated due to the strange magic in the area.Â 

When the [[Drankorian Empire]] fell, the area that is now [[Tokra]] was abandoned, and the forts fell into ruin, until the Dunmari came. The [[Lakan Monastery]] was established on the hill above the elven ruins, in the wreckage of a Drankorian fort, in DR 1194.
