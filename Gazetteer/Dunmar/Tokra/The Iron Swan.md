### The Iron Swan

A dwarven tavern, towards the northern part of town, in the (small) dwarven quarters behind the [[Archives]]. Has a few rooms reserved for traveling dwarves; otherwise, exclusively a tavern. Dark, cramped, interior, but serves great beer. Run by [[Vistra Fireforge]], a retired mercenary / adventurer.
