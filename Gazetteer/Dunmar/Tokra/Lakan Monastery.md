### Lakan Monastery

The Lakan monastery is set on a hill about 3 1/2 miles south of [[Tokra]], overlooking the River [[Hara]]. The ancient road from [[Tokra]] winds up the cliffs approaching the monastery.

The monastery itself consists of a large, main building, containing the temple of [[Laka]], a cloister around an open practice ground / stone garden, kitchens, dining hall, dormitories, a chapter house and meeting space, a significant library, storerooms, and a well to bring water from the river below.

The entrance to the grounds is controlled by a gatehouse on the road, although there is no wall.

Arranged in a circle around the main monastery are the twelve shrines of [[Laka]]. The shrines are connected by a walkway, which also encircles the Monastery.

In between the shrines and the main building to the north, on the other side of [[Tokra]], are three workshops. These are largely used to construct magic items - the [[Lakan Mystai]] specialize in the manipulations of planar energy, so construct bags of holding and other items connected to extradimensional spaces, as well as sending stones and similar items. 

The largest workshop is built, in part, on the [[ancient elven ruins]] of an old elven workshop constructed around a place where the wild, unbounded natural energy of [[Arborea]] flowed into the material plane

There is a small lay archives, run by [[Kassi]], which mostly contains copies of works of Dunmari religion, and a much larger private archive for initiates only. In the private archives are many records dealing with the planes, gods, the nature of divinity, the nature of the material plane, magic, and related topics.

##### Twelve Shrines of Laka
Arranged in a circle around the main monastery are the twelve shrines of Laka:

1.  (January) The Shining Stone. A tall stone pillar with a hole in the top positioned so, on Laka's day, the sun shines through the hole and is amplified.
2.  (February) The Passing Soul. A pool of clear water, totally still, that never ripples or moves or shows reflections, except on the night of a full moon in February, when it becomes a window to Arkaan.
3.  (March) The Turning of the Cycle. An elaborate labyrinth etched into the ground. On the spring equinox, the light of the morning sun causes the etchings to glow and the faint echoes of all who have and will in the future walk the labyrinth can vaguely be sensed. Said to be the place to pray to know when the right time for things.
4.  (April) The Water of Life. A spring and fountain that bursts with clear sweet water on the [[Festival of Rebirth]].
5.  (May) The Red Wind Rises. Five standstone pillars rising from the ground, windswept. On windy days in May it is said the voices of the the gods can be heard echoing among the pillars.
6.  (June) The Timeless Moon. A single pale circle of white stone set in the ground, raised above the land on a dais with steps from four sides to approach it. In June, glows with moon light.
7.  (July) The Forest that Was. A grassy area, crossed by trails, seemingly missing the trees that should loom over the underbrush. On Chidya's Day, the ancient forest of the elves can be seen from here.
8.  (August) The Planar Clock. A stone spiral winding in to a strange metal orrery with interlocking, rotating spheres. On the first new moon of August, the metal orrery will spin and those with the skill can see visions of the planes in it.
9.  (Sept) The Encircled Memories. A circle of columns, surrounding an altar to Laka.
10.  (Oct) The Wind that Will Be. An arch standing alone, a small altar below it. In October, you can hear the winds of other places blowing.
11.  (Nov) The Blessing of Bounty. A stone altar, weathered and worn but covered in prayers written by the monks. On the day of the Harvest Fest, fills with bountiful food and drink, which is said to bless those who need it.
12.  (Dec) The Quiet Dark. A black dome, the only entrance a narrow passage that requires crawling on the ground. A place to confront sins and atone during Sonkar's Day.
