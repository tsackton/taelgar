## Overview of Darba

Darba is a walled city set on the rocky coast, perched above the flooded swamps of the Rudhan river. From a distance, the white walls of the old Drankorian fort that guards the harbor gleam in the sun, its six towers commanding a wide view across the bustling city. The old trade road follows the height of land north of the river, avoiding the flooded swamps of the delta in monsoon, approaching the old gates of the city, the ancient Drankorian wrought iron motifs of confronted lions framing the gate and visible even from a distance.

To the south of the walls, across the estuary, a shanty town of wooden dwellings and flooded, muddy streets stretches inland for some distance. Now, in the monsoon flood, small boats ply their trade back and forth along the river, many distinctive high-prowed Illorian poled boats. In the sheltered estuary, the masts of tall sailing ships can just be seen dancing on the waves at dock. Three and four masted, square rigged Chardonian trading caravels, small and fast Illorian lanteen-rigged ships, and the occasional junk-rigged sailing ship with unusual stiff sails from farther afield. The Dunmari are not know as shipbuilders, but the occasional single-masted Dunmari longship patrols the waters.

To the north, the waves lap against the sea wall, a thin beach of sand and rock exposed at low tide. A few distant ships ride at anchor here, and small fishing boats heading out to sea are a common sight.

A steady flow of traffic - dwarves with iron wares to trade, merchant caravans loaded with exotic goods heading south to [[Nayahar]], halfling traders taking goods overland to [[Songara]], lumber and food moving in and out of the city.

The land along the river is marshy and not much settled, but the floodplains are fertile farmland and you pass many communal pastures and fields, and the occasional small village, although even here the population is restless and many dwellings are not permanent.

The north bank is less marshy than the south, and there are several weirs and water mills that dot the landscape just inland of Darba, helping fuel in the industry of the city.

%% Other Notes

#### Topology

The center of Darba, roughly Fort Hill (1), Temple Street (4), and the grand market square, is on a rise of the land that means the coasts are rocky/cliffy. The land slopes down towards the east/river, and towards the north/ocean, so the north side of town has walls and sandy beaches, and the south side of town has tidal flats and marshy ground.

The main road roughly follows the height of land, with the slope steeper to the south and more gradual to the north.

#### City Districts

Fort Hill (area 1) - the old Drankorian fort. This is the original settled area dating to DR 377, so over 1000 years ago. Was initially a fort and Drankorian naval base to provide defense of the western frontier, as well as a trading post / outpost to trade with the [[Nevos Sea]] coast area. The Drankorian fort dominates this district. It is a white-walled, six-pointed castle with a central keep perched on a hill overlooking the city and the docks. Gleams in the sun, etc. Within arrow/catapult range (and spell range) of the harbor mouth so provided defense. Now this area is the rich part of town, with the castle turned over to civil adminstration and occupied by the high priest of Darba.

Temple Street (area 4) - the center of Dunmari religious life. A large, wide boulevard (Temple Street) runs from the old fort to the (newer) Dunmari temple constructed on the same rise of land. Also now a fairly rich and exclusively Dunmari area. The temple itself is unusually grandiose, built after the reconquest of Darba from the Illorians as a sign of Dunmari dominance (the old temple was destroyed in the original Illorian conquest).

Market Square (area 3) - this area is dominated by a huge market square with a central bazaar with permanent stalls, rain shelter, etc, kind of like the big public markets in Italian cities, iron and glass. This is an unusual building, not in the typical Dunmari style, and relatively new, commissioned from Dwarven architects in DR 1644, expanding and building over an older market square that was no longer adequate to the trade flowing through Darba. The market square area saw extensive urban renewal during this period, with many cramped apartments and small artisans shops torn down and rebuilt as grand merchant palaces for the emerging wealthy secular elite of western Dunmar.

Docks (area 2) - steep streets lead down to the bustling docks on the north side of the Rudhan, in a natural deep water harbor. This area has retained some of its Illorian character, having been extensively redeveloped during the Illorian occupation from DR 1552-1558, serving as a base for coastal raids in the later two years of Chire's rule. While most of the actual Illorians left in the city have been driven across the river to the slums, there is still some architectural character here as the Dunmari are not known for their harbors. Indeed many Dunmari are superstitious of ships, and what Dunmari ships there are always have a horse figurehead, and departing ships "feed" the horse with dirt from the port of departure, as a way of making sure they can find their way back.

Waterworks (area 6) - this is the fairly large artisan/merchant area, that spreads from the market area north. Piped water from springs in the north flows to a cistern here, referred to as [[Jeevali]]'s Well. There are ancient baths from the Drankorian era that have been repurposed/reused for housing/palaces; originally this was kind of an open area around the baths but has filled in as the city grew. This is also where a lot of Chardonian settlement is, and where the Temple to the Eight Divines can be found.

Dwarven quarter (area 5) - the area west of the waterworks, now dominated by dwarves. Much more of a real "dwarven quarter" than in [[Tokra]]. Dwarven architecture, smithies, etc. Pretty rich, well-off area. Center of currency exchange, moneylenders, etc, largely handled by dwarves in Darba at least.

Green (area 7) - this area is the old green, still largely open space for animals, also stockyards, warehouses, lumber, which spill outside the walls. The main gate passes through this neighborhood.

Slums (area 8) - south of the city, across the river, is largely marshy slums now. There is little fresh water on the south side, and the land is swampy and less rocky, so floods much more regularly during the monsoon. This is now a patchwork of Illorians, the Dunmari poor, lizardfolk, and others. It is bustling and vibrant in some ways but clearly not as well off - buildings are falling apart, the docks are shabby, people are sicker, the streets flood, etc.

## Points of Interest

Taverns. Generally speaking, taverns cluster in the market area and (area 3), with some catering to sailors / foreigners in the docks (area 2) - fewer real taverns in areas 1-6. A few larger Dunmari-style caravanserai outside the walls and one in area 7 that also serves as a major stable / stockyard.

Shops. Dwarven quarter good for gems/coin; market for nearly everything else, including magic; some magic also bought/sold in the temple district, especially healing magic. Black market type stuff mostly in area 8.

Civil administration. Like all Dunmari cities, Darba is run by the high priest of the temple. Darba has a more complicated tax regime though, with a customs house to regular trade / docks and collect tolls, as well as market fees and other taxes. Most of the administration is run through the old Dunmari fort, rather than the temple itself, which is focused on religion.
