### Ikram's Caravanserai

On the northern outskirts of town stands a caravanserai, a large square building with a open courtyard, rooms for travelers, and space for merchants and animals. This is a center of commence in the village when the market is deserted, and many things can be acquired from [[Ikram]], the proprietor. 

Largely destroyed in the gnoll attacks. A new caravanserai is under construction, larger and better fortified.
