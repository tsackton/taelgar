### Shakun's Wellspring

Shakun's Wellspring is a sacred grove on the southern edge of the [[Red Mesa]], a place of peace and tranquility and a place to commune with [[Shakun]]. Shakun's Wellspring is a hidden grove in the south of the [[Red Mesa]], of old, gnarled trees that seem out of place in the desert. During the day, it is nothing, really, and has no particular power, but at night a clear pool appears in the middle of the trees, that reflects not just stars but other planes as well. Shakun herself is said to appear sometimes.

The pool leads to [[Shakun's Realm]], a demi-plane of the divine controlled by [[Shakun]].

%% Notes

"At southern edge of [[Red Mesa]], if they are traveling along the top, a formation of rocks that look almost like acacia trees, the kind of tree with a thin trunk and then branches spread out on top like a flat plate. In the middle, a chasm, steps carved in the side leading down to a sheltered area, a narrow slot canyon that leads south.

Following south about 200 feet, walls open up to a giant bowl, open to the sky above but surrounded by high cliff walls, 100 feet up or more. The entire area is maybe 700-800 feet across.

Around the walls, a series of gnarled trees grow, looking like living versions of the stone trees above. Maybe 10 or so, in a rough circle.

In the middle of the circle is a dry, dusty area. At night, the pool is filled with water, and reflects the stars and more.

At the far end, a small camp has been set up, a tent and cookpot and a hammock strung between two trees, and small rug on the ground near a series of small statues of the gods. Two wooden posts have been set up and between them some kind of meat is drying -- it seems like someone has been here from some days. "
