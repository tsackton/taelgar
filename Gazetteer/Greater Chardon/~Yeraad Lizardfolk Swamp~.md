# The ~Yeraad Lizardfolk Swamp~

The “Yeraad lizardfolk swamps” are the wetlands and marshes of the lower [[Yeraad Watershed]], home to some of the largest lizardfolk communities south of [[Chardon]].

The term is used loosely, and may refer to multiple distinct swamps and riverine wetlands across the basin rather than a single continuous marsh.

various lizardfolk swamps in the [[Yeraad Watershed]]. 
part of this swampy area is the homeland of [[Samso]] in the Great Library campaign, which was canonically abandoned due to some mysterious disease/curse/something that only samso survived - however this is probably a small part of the entire region
likely represents a collection of different lizardfolk areas

## DM notes

%% Potential contradiction to review: this note’s placeholder text associates Samso’s homeland with the Yeraad basin, but `Samso` describes his home village `Urkabi` as being in Portalia, west of the Old Chardon Canal. %%
