# The ~Lake Valandros Hills~

>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

A region of rugged hills and rough terrain west of [[Lake Valandros]]. Many small rivers rise in these hills and flow west to the [[Endless Ocean]] through the [[Coastlands]]. 

%% some previous brainstorming suggests possibly a region of mining for Chardon; also an area where refugees hid out during the hobgoblin occupation of the upper coast of the [[Coastlands]] %%
