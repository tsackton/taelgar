# Lake Valandros

Lake Valandros is a vast lake in the northern branch of the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]]. Many rivers flow into it from the north, while the [[Nahadi]] is its only outflow, joining the [[Chasa]] near [[Chardon]].

The lake lies along key routes between [[Voltara]] and [[Chardon]]. Goods from the northern frontier are often carried overland to the lake and continue south by riverboat along the Nahadi and Chasa.

## Geography

- The [[Zarnato]] and the [[Snake River]] join north of the lake, and their combined waters ultimately reach it.
- The [[Crimson Forest]] stretches east from the lake towards the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]].
