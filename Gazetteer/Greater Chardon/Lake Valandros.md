# Lake Valandros

Lake Valandros is a vast lake in the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], gathering all the waters from the northern part of the watershed, which then exit the lake via the broad [[Nahadi]]. 

The western shores of the lake are generally hilly, densely settled, and are a productive source of iron and silver for the [[Chardonian Empire]]. The eastern shores are less populated, with patchy forests that spread east to join the [[Crimson Forest]] in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]. 

Lake Valandros serves as a major trade connection between the [[Northern Provinces]] and the hinterlands of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. Goods from the northern frontier, especially [[chalyte]] from [[Voltara]], are carried overland to the lake and continue south by riverboat along the Nahadi and Chasa.
