## Major Historical Eras
_See more: {links}_

This area saw much disruption and loss of life in the [[Blood Years]] and many details of the early history of the region are lost. The scholars of Chardon have preserved better records of the [[History of the Drankorian Empire|Drankorian Era]], and a rough history can be reconstructed. 
#### Before Drankor
_Before DR 597_
Little is known of the history of this region before the [[Drankorian Western Wars|the coming of Drankor]].  It is widely believed that early migrants from [[Hkar]] lived along the [[~North Chardon Coast~]] in the shadow of [[Alcarinque|Alcarinquë]] before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]] but the cultures and civilizations these migrants formed during and after the Downfall is not recorded. 
#### Western Wars
_DR 597 - DR 634_
Between DR 597 and DR 634, Drankor fought a series of [[Drankorian Western Wars|series of wars]] to force the people of the [[Yeraad Watershed]] and [[~North Chardon Coast~]] into the growing Drankorian Empire.  In the telling of the [[Faculty of History]] at the [[University of Chardon]], the  wars brought civilization and safety to a land full of dangers. The [[Society of Ocean Watchers]] in [[Hamri]] would tell a different tale, of Drankorian conquest seeking treasure and plunder, and agricultural land for their expanding empire, with no concerns for the inhabitants of the land.
#### Drankorian Era
_DR 634 - DR 1059_
For the next five hundred years, Drankor ruled in peace and prosperity. The city of [[Chardon]] was founded, and grew and prospered. Few records are well attested of this time, although surely the [[Faculty of History]] has lost scrolls or hidden records that tell of the growth of the city of Chardon, at least.
#### Fall of Drankor and Post-Imperial Era
_DR 1059 - DR 1540_
When Drankor fell to [[First Plague|plague]] and the empire shattered, the imperial provinces were left to fend for themselves. In the chaos, [[Chardon]] emerged as a leading light, first amongst equals in the post-Drankorian landscape, growing rich on the wisdom and fame of its [[University of Chardon|university]] and [[Great Library|library]], as well as trade with Dunmar through the [[Myraeni Gap]] and [[Sembara]] along the [[Yeraad]] river and over the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] at [[Urlich Pass]].  Although tales of the small kingdoms that grew from the imperial provinces along the [[~North Chardon Coast~]] must exist, they are not widely known, and this period is largely a blank in the popular imagination.

#### The Blood Years
_DR 1545 - DR 1597_
Although the [[Great War]] ended in DR 1545, the vast army of [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] and other terrors that [[Cha'mutte]] had amassed did not simply disappear. Over the next 30 years, two major wars were fought across the lands north of Chardon: the [[Conclave War]] and the to be named war against the hobgoblins. 

basic idea: conclave war then in the 1560s a series of expansion of hobgoblins, stopped in 1561 or 1562, but not really peaceful - next 10 years are back and forth along the north chardon coast; but in 1574 some type of armistace line is drawn, splitting (or even leaving the hobgoblins with most of the coast). Perhaps there is another human kingdom involved here (the "yellow 5 kingdom from other maps"?) in the north, pincering the hobgoblins a bit. 

chardon is settling chasa valley here

#### Early Imperial Era
_DR 1597 - DR _
During mawar renai; hobgoblins are stilla round the malakel entrance, but somewhat hemmed in by something in the north so don't really have a good expansion plan; perhaps even being somewhat decent rulers in a way; chardon growing in the chasa valley but not really an empire just yet

 DR 1597, when the Umbral Covenant launches the Shadow Armada to conquer Chardon, and loses badly - awakening moment - empire is working this is not like the conclave war at all leads to first serious wave of expansion
#### Imperial Expansion
_DR 1597 - present_
three phases: 
* apporia - 1597 - 1610 
* 1650 - 1675 - conquest of hobgoblins; (mindknife war just after this)
* 1690 - 1710 - chaylte


Whatever the truth, in the first few decades of the 600th year since the founding of Drankor, the legions of empire swept through the region, and established suzerainty over all the land between the [[Tawir Forest]] in the north and [[Ainumarya]] in the east. Whatever the origins of this conquest, for almost 500 years the land prospered, and the city of [[Chardon]] was founded and grew. 

When the [[Great War]] came, the lands north of [[Chardon]] bore the brunt of the attacks from [[Cha'mutte|Cha'mutte's]] armies, and even after his defeat, the [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]] did not vanish. The [[Blood Years]] saw the destruction of many of the small realms to the north, and during the [[Conclave War]] threatened [[Chardon]] itself. In the aftermath of these wars, the [[Chardonian Empire]] was born.

## DM Notes and Meta
_See also: [[Places in Greater Chardon]]

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* Although some features lack names, this region is substantially developed in broad strokes, especially the current day large-scale political organization, and the basic geography and climate. The Chasa River Valley, including the city of Chardon, has lots of current-day canonical details. The existence of large lizardfolk communities in the [[Yeraad Watershed]] is canonical. The north coast of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] has a sketched history with some canonical details, and detailed development of current day political units, climate, and geography. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* While this region has a canonical history in broad strokes, many details are only weakly or non-canonically developed, or left blank. Although canonically most of this region is part of the Chardonian Empire, the local political cultures are largely undeveloped. 

*Needs Development:* The history and current political culture of this region exists only in very broad strokes, for the most part, and could use additional development. The details of the smaller cities and provinces of the Chardonian Empire could use development as well. The Yeraad River and the associated lizardfolk settlements there are only weakly developed.

*Intentionally Blank:* None.

*Adventures:* The Dunmar Frontier campaign Chardon/Elderwood arc was partly set in this region, and the Apporia/Merfolk arc mostly set here. Despite the centrality of Chardon to the politics and culture of the Dunmar Frontier campaign, only a small number of sessions have been set in Greater Chardon.  

*Important Places in Staging:* The [[~North Chardon Coast~]] and the [[~Chardon Hills~]] are the two most important places.

## Overview

## Boundaries

The West Coast Region includes the entirety of the [[Chardonian Empire]], as well as the [[Nevos Sea]] area, the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], and the [[Erbalta Plains]], plus the coastal regions west and north of the [[Erbalta Plains]]. It also includes the islands in the [[Endless Ocean]]. 

- To the north, this region is bordered by the mysterious cold of the [[Far North]]. 
- To the east, this region is bordered by the [[~North Nahadi River~]], [[Ainumarya]], and the [[Myraeni Gap]].
- To the south, this region is bordered by the [[Sea of Storms]] and the ocean beyond the [[Nevos Sea]]
- To the west, this region is bordered by the [[Endless Ocean]]

## Major Features

%%much of this region is not well developed, so more uncertainty here; some things can go to worldbuilding or commets as needed%%

- [[~North Chardon Coast~]]: *The wide coastland north of Chardon. Canonically all that is developed about this area is that it is fertile agricultural land. This is approx. 38 N to 45 N latitudes. Probably the southern part is more strictly Mediterranean, with extensive cotton, olive, and wine production (Metium is a major wine-producer), while the northern part is highly productive for grains. Basic geographic/climatic outline is Mediterranean in the south transitioning to a more oceanic influence in the north, with grain cultivation in river valleys and hot-summer crops like olives in the hills. Probably should extend the oceanic climate of Mawar into the northern stretches of this area, around 45 N. Real world influences would include parts of Italy, southern France, and other Med agricultural areas, and California Central Valley.*
- [[Lake Valandros]]: *Huge lake, with no canonical details. Likely somewhat dry on the west side and humid and rainy on the east side, just from mountain influence. Probably also agricultural - rice production for example might be common.*
- [[Mawakel Peninsula]]: *See Mawar notes. Currently unresolved is if this is more of a Cool Maritime Climate (Cfb) with limited winter snow, as currently marked (analogy: coastal Ireland, Pacific NW), or if this is more of a Subpolar Oceanic Climate (Cfc) with heavy winter snowfall and limited agriculture (analogy: Iceland or Norwegian coasts). I guess I have leaned towards the former, with the further north coast beyond Mawar more of the Norway analog.*
- [[~North Bay~]]: *Lots of land northeast of Mawar. The east coast, near Voltara, has a bit of detail from Great Library campaign, but otherwise this is totally open and undeveloped.*
- [[Snake River]]: *Canon: center for chalyte mining - mountainous and arid with extensive plains.*
- [[Tawir Forest]]: *So far just a name.*
- [[Chasa River Valley]]: *agricultural mixed with forests, major population center*
- [[Yeraad Watershed]]: *southeast of Chardon, south of Chasa/Elderwood. Major lizardfolk area, mining in the hills that separate it from Chasa, and in the "Darba Mountains". Very little detail otherwise - probably fairly flat, hot in the summer. This is basically med transitioning to semi-arid in the east and south, likely supporting fruit trees near the coast, and extensive livestock, probably the center of the Chardon cattle industry.*
- [[Apporia]]: *Undeveloped until the kelp forest adventure off the coast.* 
- [[Nevos Sea]] and [[Emerald Bay]]: *trending into subtropics here*

%% comments
- As an aside, thinking about the Chardonian Empire: one of the striking facts that seems to come up all the time in the book about the Mediterranean I read is how desperate a lot of maritime powers were for grain, all the time. Certainly Tollen is in this position. But I think one of Chardon's strengths is just how agriculturally rich the heartland of the empire is. The Chasa River Vally, the North Chardon Coast, and Lake Valandros are all probably incredibly productive agricultural land. Pre-Great-War, Chardon probably relied a lot on trade to supply its food needs; after the Great War, it was packed with refugees and probably suffered a number of famines - as the Chardonian armies conquered north, especially on the west coast, they would be strongly inclined to incorporate the newly freed productive agricultural areas into an empire. I think this also informs the character of the city a lot. Chardon is not really a mercantile superpower - it isn't deeply connected to international trade networks. There is some trade that goes upriver to the dwarves; there is some south with Dunmar, especially for horses and the products of the Nardith; there is some with Mawar. But, mostly, trade is internal. chalyte from the north; grain from the coast; wine from the area around Chardon; metals from the southern areas, the mountains north of Darba and the hills between the Chasa and the Yeraad. Chardon is certainly growing as a naval power and there is likely some decent trade with Illoria, and the occasional brave ship that ventures to cross the Sea of Storms. An implication of this is perhaps that they actually restrict the export of grain, and instead subsidize it internally, so that grain is cheap in Chardon, which helps the city grow fast and extremely big. Most of their exports would be high value tech goods, basically, plus probably wine/olive oil/luxury foodstuff (mostly to dwarves and Dunmar).

## Climate

Most of the extensive coastline of the Chardonian empire, stretching from the mouth of the [[Yeraad]] river to the southern fringes of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], is a temperate region with [warm or hot summers and wet, cool winters](https://geodiode.com/climate/mediterranean). The [[Mawakel Peninsula]] itself ...

%%
From old GDrive doc on Geography

Major features include a major river, large forests to the east against the ~CentralMountains~, a large lake on the main river north of Chardon, a significant peninsula extending into the Endless Ocean south of Chardon, and several island systems and a large bay in the north. In the far north, a chain of volcanoes extends from the central mountains, and the land becomes mountainous and covered in glaciers approaching and beyond the arctic circle. The climate is mild, with wet winters and dry summers; pleasant year round temperatures to the south; cold, snowy winters to the north; and significant coastal moderation on the many islands and peninsulas of this region.

### 3. Chardonian Empire and the Mawakel Peninsula

*Area:* This region stretches north from the [[~South Chardon River~]] and includes the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the [[Voltara]] region, as well as the [[~North Chardon Coast~]], the [[Tawir Forest]], and the [[Mawakel Peninsula]].

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* 

*Non-Canonical Development:* 

*Blank Regions:* The  [[~North Chardon Coast~]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the region stretching from the [[Tawir Forest]] to the coast west of [[Voltara]] are largely blank, but could use some additional development. Nowhere in this region is intentionally left blank, except perhaps the [[Tawir Forest]] itself. 

*Adventures:* The [[Mawar Adventures]] episodes are entirely set in this region, on the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]; the [[Great Library Campaign]] is based in [[Voltara]] with several adventures covering the local area around Voltara; the Dunmar Frontier campaign Chardon/Elderwood arc was set in this region. 

## 4. Apporia and the Nevos Sea

*Area:* This region includes the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], the islands of [[Illoria]], the [[Yeraad Watershed]], and the [[Nevos Sea]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* 

*Non-Canonical Development:* There are a number of lightly defined regions here (in particular, [[Illoria]] and the [[Yeraad Watershed]] are lightly sketched, at best). The exact cultural heritage of [[Illoria]] is unclear, as is its history during the [[History of the Drankorian Empire]].

*Blank Regions*: Illoria itself lacks anything more than some basic vibes, and the Emerald Bay coast of the Apporian Peninsula, outside the terminus of the [[Old Chardon Canal]], is nearly entirely blank. These areas are not intentionally blank and could use development. On the Apporia Peninsula, the interior and western coasts are intentionally left blank and mysterious. The southern and eastern coasts of the Apporian Peninsula is plausibly either Illorian or something mysterious, but has not been canonically developed at all.  The overall history of this region, at least outside the intentionally blank areas, could use development building on the existing fragments. 

*Adventures:* Illoria has been at the edge of several Dunmari Frontier adventures, but only two sessions were actually set in the Nevos Sea, and primarily involved traveling to and then through the [[Old Chardon Canal]]. The merfolk arc of the Dunmari Frontier was partially set on the north coast of Apporia.
