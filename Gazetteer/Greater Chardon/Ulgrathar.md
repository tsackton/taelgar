Ulgrathar is a giant realm in the [[Chataan Mountains]], remembered in Chardonian sources chiefly for its rich deposits of [[chalyte]] in the valleys below [[Thundercrown]]. In recent years it has been ruled by the stone giant [[Dhrukmir]], and stone giants such as [[Brunnar]] are known to have lived under his dominion.

## DM notes

- Pronunciation note and additional brainstorming: `_DM_/_Dunmari Frontier/Session 124 - 128 (Chardon)`.
- The Dunmar Frontier campaign developed significant additional detail around Ulgrathar’s settlement, mines, and the chalyte-powered weapons associated with Dhrukmir; treat session outcomes as campaign-specific unless separately recorded elsewhere.
