# The Chardonian Empire
>[!info]+ Information

The Chardonian Empire is a growing realm ruled from the city of [[Chardon]]. Its power rests on the legions, the city’s institutions of learning and magic, and the wealth of the [[Chalyte|chalyte]] trade.

Chardonian historians often date the empire’s rise to the aftermath of the [[War of the Dark Rift]], when Chardon defeated the Shadow Armada and began to extend its authority over neighboring provinces and coasts.

## The Empire and Its Lands

The empire’s heartland lies around Chardon and the lower [[Chasa]]: river valleys of grain and wine, coastal plains of wheat, and the busy maritime highway of the [[Gulf of Chardon]]. Beyond these well‑tended lands, Chardonian rule extends into older coastal provinces and newer frontier provinces—some tightly administered, others bound to Chardon by charters, taxes, and garrisons more than by daily governance.

Among the most commonly named regions of the empire are:

- The [[Chasa River Valley]], a broad agricultural basin whose river towns and market charters feed Chardon and carry goods to and from the interior.
- The [[Coastlands]], the long western littoral of farms, rivers, beaches, and wetlands that runs north and south of Chardon.
- The shores and tributaries of [[Lake Valandros]], a key inland route linking the northern frontier to the imperial core.
- The [[Northern Provinces]] beyond Lake Valandros, a lightly settled frontier whose wealth is tied to [[Voltara]] and [[Chalyte|chalyte]].
- The Apporian provinces on the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], a coastal realm shaped by the canal trade and the memory of the [[War of the Dark Rift]].
- The southern mining province of [[Alta Tonaro]], centered on [[Argento]] in the northern [[Chataan Mountains]].
- The archipelago of [[Illoria]], recently conquered and governed as a protectorate.

## Rule and Administration

Chardon is both capital and model: an imperial city of precincts, offices, and charters. Imperial rule is exercised in Chardon by the Magistros and a sprawling civil bureaucracy; in the provinces by governors, proconsuls, and chartered officials, often supported by legionary garrisons.

The [[Curia of 42]] is the elected assembly of Chardon. While much authority lies with the Magistros and the imperial bureaucracy, the Curia retains leverage through control of the charter monopolies, administered by the [[Chamber of Stamps]].

Provincial rule varies widely:

- In the [[Northern Provinces]], the empire’s presence is felt in forts, roads, and the governance centered on [[Greater Voltara]].
- In the Apporian provinces, Chardonian influence is strongest in [[Portalia]]—where the canal tolls are collected and the legions maintain fortifications—and loosest in [[Cedrano]] and especially [[Raziolo]], where local autonomy remains strong.
- In [[Illoria]], Chardon rules indirectly as a protectorate.

## Economy, Trade, and Chalyte

Chardon’s wealth is rooted in a mixture of soil, sea, and scholarship: grain and timber from river valleys, fish and salt from the coast, and the high‑value products of a city that prizes learning, craft, and arcane industry.

### The Chalyte Economy

[[Chalyte]]—a rare mineral imbued with the essence of the [[Plane of Magic]]—is the cornerstone of modern imperial power. It is a charter monopoly in the empire: refined chalyte can only be produced by license holders, and is regulated through civic offices in Chardon. The long‑established structure of the trade is described in [[Politics of Chalyte (Chardonian Empire)]], including the role of the [[Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon]] and the influence of the [[Hetaeri Magica]] as a purchaser and distributor of refined chalyte.

Chalyte’s impact is not confined to furnaces and workshops. In Chardon, it powers civic marvels—clean water and public lights among them—and underwrites the empire’s naval reach, for chalyte fuels the [[Windcallers]] who guide ships and bend winds to imperial needs.

### The Canal and the Gulf

The [[Old Chardon Canal]] ties the empire’s western coast to the [[Nevos Sea]] and the wider world. Built with magic by the Drankorians, it is a regulated and taxed passage. The canal’s tolls and traffic enrich [[Portalia]], and the approaches are guarded by forts and naval works; ships making the transit rely on windcaller pilots through the narrow, windless reaches.

The sheltered [[Gulf of Chardon]] is the empire’s maritime corridor, busy with fishing boats, merchantmen, and naval vessels bound for Chardon, Apporia, and beyond.

## Faith and Language

Across much of the empire, the Way of the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] is widespread, and Chardonian scholars commonly speak of a distinct Chardonian tradition of the Way.

The dominant tongue of the empire is [[Languages#Chardonian|Chardonian]], a descendant of Drankorian speech written in the Drankorian alphabet. Chardon’s scholars and officials also preserve older Drankorian learning, though much scholarship is now written in Chardonian rather than the classical tongue.

## A Brief History

The empire is young by the standards of Chardon, whose own founding as a Drankorian fortress‑town predates it by more than a millennium. In the centuries after the fall of Drankor, Chardon grew as a city of learning and trade; in the generations after the [[Great War]], it began to consolidate power beyond its walls.

In the most commonly told imperial chronology:

- DR 1584–1597: The [[War of the Dark Rift]] erupts on [[Apporia]]. In DR 1597 the Umbral Covenant launches the Shadow Armada against Chardon and is destroyed; Chardonian writers often treat this as the decisive turning point.
- DR 1597–1619: Chardon’s campaigns in Apporia secure [[Portalia]] and establish imperial control over the [[Old Chardon Canal]]; the canal is reopened under Chardonian authority in DR 1619, and cities like [[Nevium]] flourish anew.
- Late DR 1600s onward: The discovery and exploitation of [[Chalyte|chalyte]] near [[Voltara]] transforms the empire’s finances and reach, tightening imperial control over the [[Northern Provinces]] and fueling the rise of chalyte‑powered magic and industry.
- DR 1689–1720: The chalyte boom in [[Alta Tonaro]] leads to rapid growth around [[Argento]], followed by decline as surface chalyte deposits dwindle and the Chataans are increasingly treated as unsafe for travel.
- The current era: Chardon’s legions have recently conquered [[Illoria]], turning a pirate archipelago into a protectorate.

## DM notes

%% AI note: DM-only synthesis and reminders, based on materials that are incomplete, excluded from publish, or explicitly marked SECRET. %%

### Canon gaps and contradictions to review

- [[Chalyte]] dates: [[Chalyte]] places discovery “in the DR 1680s”, while [[Auratan Family]] attributes a discovery in DR 1671 to Appius Auratan. [[Alta Tonaro]] begins its boom with reports in DR 1689. These should be reconciled (different lodes vs. different “discovery” milestones).
- Empire formation: This page treats DR 1597 (Shadow Armada defeat) as the turning point, consistent with [[Letter from Chardon for Samso on the Umbral Covenant]] and [[Apporia]]. The [[War of the Dark Rift]] event note includes additional detail, but much of it is currently marked SECRET.

### Useful DM-facing sources for further expansion (not all canon)

- [[West Coast History Framework]] (excluded from publish; mix of canonical facts and scaffolding).
- [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]] (excluded; background framing for the Blood Years and Coastlands hobgoblin occupation).
- [[War of the Dark Rift]] (event note is a stub; SECRET block has more consequences and tone for Apporia).
- [[Praecanti Vigiles]] and [[Imperial Palace]] (staging writeups used in recent campaigns; treat as DM-facing unless moved into Gazetteer).
