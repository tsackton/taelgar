Fort Ameli is a [[Chardonian Empire|Chardonian]] fort that guards the entrance to the [[Old Chardon Canal]]. It lies on the canal, about 10 miles inland from southern entrance, where the broad tidal estuary around [[Pergia]] narrows to the canal proper. The fort was originally constructed during the [[History of the Drankorian Empire|Drankorian Era]], though it has been expanded and rebuilt several times since. 

Ships making passage through the canal are required to dock here, pay tolls, and take on a windcaller pilot.
