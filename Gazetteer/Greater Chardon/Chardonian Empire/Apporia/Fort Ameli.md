# Fort Ameli

Fort Ameli is an old Drankorian fort that guards the entrance to the [[Old Chardon Canal]]. It lies at Mile 10 of the canal, north of the tidal estuary near [[Pergia]].

Ships making passage through the canal are required to dock at Fort Ameli to pay tolls and, for sailing vessels, to take on a windcaller pilot.
