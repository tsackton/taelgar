Emerald Bay is a broad bay in the [[Nevos Sea]], south of [[Apporia|the Apporian Peninsula]]. The [[Yeraad]] reaches the sea here, and the southern entrance to the [[Old Chardon Canal]] opens onto the bay near [[Pergia]].

This area is dotted with small islands, and has significant merchant traffic.
