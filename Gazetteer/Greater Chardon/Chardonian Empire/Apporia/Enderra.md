# Enderra

Enderra is remembered in the histories of [[Apporia|the Apporian Peninsula]] as a dwarven and stoneborn realm in the interior mountains. It was destroyed during the [[War of the Dark Rift]].

Surviving accounts of Enderra focus largely on its fall, and on the emergence of the [[Umbral Covenant]] in the wars that followed.
