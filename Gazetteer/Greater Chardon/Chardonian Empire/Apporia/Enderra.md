Important in Great Library Arc 5
[[Kazuro]] backstory has some relevant information as well.

Unclear if this refers to the mountains, the stoneborn realm, or both. Unclear if any stoneborn still live there. 
There was also a dwarven kingdom beneath the mountains. Its fate is not decided but likely largely destroyed.
