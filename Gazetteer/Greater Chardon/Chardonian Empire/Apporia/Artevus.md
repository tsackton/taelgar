Artevus is a small coastal town in northern [[Portalia]], primarily a minor market town for local fisherfolk. A relatively poor town, and somewhat dilapidated, Artevus is something of a sleepy backwater. 

The docks and the market square, with the nearby temple of the [[Mos Numena]], are the most notable local landmarks. A few quiet inns and taverns line the edge of the market square, near the docks, but are rarely busy.
