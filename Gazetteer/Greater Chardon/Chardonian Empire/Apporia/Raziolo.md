Raziolo is one of the three Apporian provinces on the northern coast of [[Apporia|the Apporian Peninsula]], occupying the flat coastal plain on the northern tip of the peninsula. It is a region of hot, dry summers and mild winters, where fields of winter wheat give way to brown earth and olive groves. 

Raziolo was not overrun during the [[War of the Dark Rift]], was the last of the Apporian provinces to join the [[Chardonian Empire]], and still retains an independent, autonomous streak. 

%%^Campaign:none%%

Not much truly confirmed canonically. City names below were invented for the Apporia arc in Dunmar campaign, but never used. 

Provincial capital: Roccena (Roc-CHE-na)

Other notable settlements: Tenze (TEN-tseh), Antissus (an-TIS-sus), Sarvia
Rivers: Silbana
Villages: Telumis, Serraventia, Canophris

Four relatively significant coastal cities, and one interior city, which was the former capital, although one of the coastal cities is now the provincial capital. 

Rolling agricultural fields; lots of olive trees and olive oil production; some wine. This is kind of Tuscan-esque. 

The coastal towns are less prominent, here, and the biggest and richest is actually the interior town, perhaps. Not nearly as seafaring as, say, Castrella. 

More roads, more internal trade. More isolated from Chardon, and more independent. 

A lot of hill forts and other fortifications in the area from the War of the Dark Rift. Joined the Chardonian Empire under economic pressure, but effectively left almost entirely autonomous besides for some trading rights and tribute. 

Main port has a big agricultural market, has the most traders. Would be location for various merfolk collectors and merchants.
