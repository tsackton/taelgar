Nevium is a bustling port city and the provincial capital of [[Portalia]], built on pilings above the salt marshes along the [[Gulf of Chardon]] coast, about 10 miles east of the [[Old Chardon Canal]]. Completely destroyed in DR 1589 during the [[War of the Dark Rift]], Nevium was rebuilt in early DR 1600s and grew quickly into a thriving port after the [[Old Chardon Canal]] was reopened under Chardonian control in DR 1619. While the sheltered harbor and productive fishing grounds have supported settlements in the marshes around Nevium for a long time, the city itself largely dates to the first have of the DR 1600s. 

Nevium is a prosperous city. In addition to the productive fisheries, and alchemical ingredients and other marsh products, the city benefits tremendously from the nearby [[Old Chardon Canal]]. The [[Windcallers]], who guide ships through the canal, are based here. Nevium is also where tax revenues from canal transits are collected, which provide significant wealth to the city, and support a large official Chardonian governmental presence.
