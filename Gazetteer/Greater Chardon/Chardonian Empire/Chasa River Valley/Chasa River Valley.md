%% A few notes from Cape prep emails:
The Chasa river valley is fertile and rich agricultural land, and the eastern frontiers near the Elderwood have a lot of timber wealth, so there is considerable trade. The road goes all the way to Arendum along the river - and the river is navigable by shallow-draft riverboats most of the way, so there is a fair bit of traffic on the river as well (mostly downstream - beyond MetiumÂ -- at the confluence of the Chasa and the Nahadi -- the Chasa narrows and the current is stronger, so upstream is slow going and needs either a large crew to row or draft animals to pull along the towpaths).
