# The Chasa River Valley

The Chasa river valley is a broad, fertile basin, a major agricultural heartland of the [[Chardonian Empire]], where terraced vineyards and fields of grain spread from the  lowlands near [[Chardon]] and the confluence of the [[Chasa]] and the [[Nahadi]], to the gentle foothills of the interior. Winters are soft and rain-laden; summers arrive warm and bright, yielding long growing seasons that make the region famed for its wines. Inland, the seasons sharpen, with hot summer afternoons and occasional frosts in winter, yet rainfall remains ample, feeding vast evergreen forests. The valley’s mosaic of rich soils, reliable rains, and varied elevations underpins a thriving agrarian culture and busy river trade.

%% think Willamette Valley, Burgundy, Central Valley, etc. Climate is mild, a mix of Mediterranean and oceanic (Koppen Cfb/Csb), with wet winters and warm, sunny summers. %%

## Travel and Landmarks

The river is the region’s spine, navigable along its entire length, carrying grain, casks, and cut wood toward larger ports. Settlements are sparser far from water; hamlets thin and the landscape gives way to forest and range. 

A major road runs along the Chasa, from [[Chardon]] to [[Arendum]], which is usually busy with traffic: farmers trundling grain and fruit to the next market town, halfling peddlers with bright carts, couriers riding hard along message routes, and temple stewards, priests, and clusters of pilgrims make steady progress between shrines. Nearer the Elderwood, small soldier detachments patrol or march to reinforce Arendum’s garrison. The river is livelier still: timber rafts and barges of hides, leather, and dwarven goods glide downstream, halfling families pole their houseboats along the banks, and upriver boats creep against the current, hauled by tow-horses on long lines. Fisherfolk dot the shallows at dawn and dusk, and farther inland, log rafts and mills feed the valley’s shipwrights and builders. Travel is generally safe—bandits prefer to melt away at a show of steel—but along the Elderwood verge travelers sometimes whisper of wolves, hungry strays, or the rare monster from the trees.

The Chasa Valley runs from the coastward confluence at **Metium**—closest to Chardon and famed for wine—upriver a few days’ march to **Erlona**, the provincial capital, and then many days farther through deepening woods to **Arendum**, a border town and timber hub raised on the ruins of **Kin-Aska**. Along the road between Metium and Erlona stands the **Harmony Stone**, a sixty-foot gray-white monolith carved in eroded Elvish and Northros runes that once marked treaty and trade, and still stirs old memories for elves. Several days beyond Erlona lies the long, barren scar of the **Battle of Shadowfire**, where dragonfire in the Blood Years leveled fortifications and left ash where the fallen stood. A little farther upriver, before the final march to Arendum, stands the ruins of **Solas Abbey**, first home of the Solatine Order, dedicated to the Wyrdling.

## History and Settlement

Though the Chasa valley suffered terribly during the [[Great War]] and the [[Conclave War]], the villages and towns of this region have thrived in the past few generations, becoming one of the empire’s great granaries. Heavily depopulated during the wars, most folk living here now are Chardonian, though some trace a mixed ancestry to the patchwork of city states and small kingdoms that occupied this region before the [[Great War]]. This is an agrarian land, where people work a varied countryside of grainfields, orchards, berry-rows, vineyards, and cattle pasture. Farther upstream, as the land gets more densely wooded, the economy shifts to timbering, and the trades of hides, furs, and leather. 

Small villages dot the valley every few miles, a handful of homes and farmsteads clustered near a small shrine or temple, where travelers can usually buy food or find a barn-loft for the night. Every day’s walk or so, a chartered market town gathers trade, with gridded streets, a proper square, baths, at least one temple, and an elected magistrate who keeps the peace and tallies the taxes. Larger towns may raise a palisade and host a garrison, projecting order across rings of outlying farms and riverside hamlets.

### **Vibe & Use Notes**

- Old imperial heartland, orderly and prosperous; roads and rivers hum with trade more than danger.
- Social feel is “modernized agrarian”: landowners act like merchants, defense is professionalized by the state, and cash changes hands for work and justice.
- **Villages:**
	- Villages range from clustered smallholds to manor-centered estates; though  most are a handful of farms and homes around a common pasture and temple
	- Lodging in villages is informal (a barn or spare room for a few silver); supplies are basic foodstuffs, maybe a smith; real gear and services are found in towns.
	- Authority is pragmatic: temple stewards handle day-to-day matters; an elected magistrate sits in the nearest market town and is reachable within a day.
- **Market Towns**:
	- Market towns operate by Imperial charter with squares, baths, multiple temples, and occasional garrisons; they collect taxes and police the surrounding countryside.
	- Have a magistrate (possibly elected by the citizens of the town, or appointed by governor of province) who administers justice and collects taxes.
	- Larger towns may have palisade walls, typically wooden; most settlements follow sensible grids and sit on riverbanks or key crossroads.
	- Each town has an area of responsibility outside its borders to administer justice and keep the peace in surrounding villages.
    - Towns also have a responsibility to collect taxes and support tax collectors.
- **Estates, labor, and landholding:**
    - There is no concept of serfdom in the Chardonian Empire.
    - Large estates that require significant labor are worked by paid laborers, not people bonded to the land.
    - Villages may be a collection of small holds (retired soldiers, peasants); some are large estates, either worked by paid farmers or leased to tenants
    - The landed aristocracy does not own all the land, though.     
    - Land owners are just capitalists and have no obligation to support defense or anything.

Mileage from Chardon:

- Mile 133: The Harmony Stone
- Mile 208: Erlona
- Mile 255: Site of the Battle of Shadowfire, a major Chardonian defeat.
- Mile 363: Solus Abbey
- Mile 510: Arendum
