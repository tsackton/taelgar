Metium is a walled city about 60 miles upriver from [[Chardon]], at the confluence of the [[Chasa]] and the [[Nahadi]] rivers. Although small in comparison to Chardon, it is a wealthy city, at the center of a highly productive wine growing region, and a hub for river traffic. Messages flow regularly from here to Chardon. 

Metium traces its history back to the [[Drankorian Empire]], originally as a fortification to protect a small river port. Although it quickly outstripping its humble beginnings, parts of the original fort still remain, integrated into the city walls and the foundations of several buildings in the oldest district. Metium was briefly sacked during the [[Conclave War]] until it was freed after Chardon's victory at the [[Battle of Metium]]. Since the end of the [[Conclave War]], Metium has grown rapidly, recovering and more from the damage dealt. 

The most notable landmark is the massive Triumphal Arch in the center of the market square, commemorating the great victorxy over the hobgoblins and dragon conclave. Almost as significant is the Tomb of the Valiant Defender, another monument to honor that war. Beneath the city, remnants of Metium’s old fortifications and drainage systems form an extensive underground network. Originally built as part of the city’s defenses and later expanded into a sewer system, these tunnels have become a hidden underworld used by smugglers, thieves, and others seeking refuge from the city’s watch. Many sections of this network are still uncharted, with rumors of lost chambers holding Drankorian relics or even forgotten treasures from the city's sacking during the [[Conclave War]].

The city is famous for its annual wine festival, held each autumn after the harvest. Traders and vintners from all across the region gather for a week of celebrations, competitions, and tastings. During this time, the city’s market square overflows with barrels of wine, decorated stalls, and entertainers, attracting both locals and travelers. The festival is a highlight of the year, giving even the humblest of citizens a chance to revel in the region's prosperity.
