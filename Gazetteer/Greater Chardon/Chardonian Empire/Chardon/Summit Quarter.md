The Summit Quarter rises to the east (upriver) from the [[Bastion Quarter|Bastion]], on the slopes of the spur of [[Mount Nera]] that stretches towards the [[Chasa]]. This is an area of terraced streets, artisans' workshops and houses, and the occasional small manor of the wealthy overseers of the [[chalyte]] refineries on the flats below. The Summit Quarter is bordered on the west by the line of the [[North Wall (Chardon)|North Wall]] that runs along the height of land of the spur and separates the bulk of the [[North Bank]] from the rich manors and enclaves of the [[Nera Domains]]. 

The Bastion Quarter and the [[Summit Quarter]] together make up Precinct XIX.
