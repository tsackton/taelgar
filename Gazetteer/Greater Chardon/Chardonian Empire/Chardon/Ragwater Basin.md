Ragwater Basin, usually just called the Basin, is a neighborhood downriver from the [[North Wall (Chardon)|North Wall]]. Historically, this was the center of the Chardonian paper-making industry, but in the past 80 years the old paper mills have been converted to [[chalyte]] refineries, and the [[Mill Channel]] repurposed to carry ore barges from the [[Chasa]]. 

This is a dirty, stinking area, and only the poorest of the poor actually live here. The nearby [[Riverside Quarter]], huddled against the banks of the [[Chasa]], is only marginally more pleasant. 

Together, the Basin and Riverside make up Precinct XVII.
