One of the three major bridges that cross the [[Chasa|Chasa River]] in the city of [[Chardon]]. The Chardon Bridge is the newest of the three bridges, built during the [[Blood Years]] to connect the fortifications along the [[Mount Nera]] spur to the [[South Bank]]. 

This bridge marks the height of navigation on the [[Chasa]], although riverboat traffic is frequent upriver from here.
