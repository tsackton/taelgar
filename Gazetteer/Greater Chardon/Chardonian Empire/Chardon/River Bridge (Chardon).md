The River Bridge is one of the engineering and magical marvels of [[Chardon]].  It is a vast span, wide enough for four carts to pass abreast, fortified at both ends with gates and towers, and built up with numerous shops and apartments. 

The central segment of the bridge, marking the dividing line between the [[Bastion Quarter]] (Precinct XIX) and Precinct VII on the [[South Bank]], is enchanted with a magical mechanism that allows the bridge to rise, for defense, traffic control, and to allow ocean-going ships to pass.
