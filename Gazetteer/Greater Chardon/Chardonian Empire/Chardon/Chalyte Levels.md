The Chalyte Levels is the low-lying riverbank area, nestled between the western part of the [[North Wall (Chardon)|North Wall]] and the banks of the [[Chasa]]. This area is largely slums, with many decrepit dwellings converted from old barracks build during the [[Blood Years]]. 

Precinct XVIII is entirely congruent with the traditional boundries of the Chalyte Levels.
