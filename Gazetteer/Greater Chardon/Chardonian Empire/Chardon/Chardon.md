Chardon is a city of many things. It is the bustling capitol and seat of government of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. It is a major center of learning and magic, host to the scholars, wizards, and academics of the [[Great Library]] and the [[University of Chardon]]. It is a trade hub and economic powerhouse, known primarily as the only source of processed [[chalyte]], but also as a city of artisans, producing clocks, optics, fine weaponry, scrolls, and other high value goods, and more recently as a major shipbuilder. 

Founded as a small outpost of the [[Drankorian Empire]] more than 1000 years ago, over the course of its long history Chardon has grown from a backwater to among the most powerful and cosmopolitan cities of the known world, home to more than 500,000 people. Like [[Drankor]] before it, Chardon is a city full of professional associations, scholarly societies, private clubs, and collegia, some more secret than others. Most well known are the magical organizations: the secretive [[Hetaeri Magica]], the scholarly [[Society of the Open Scroll]], and the famous faculty of the [[University of Chardon]]. But numerous smaller societies form the fabric of social life in Chardon.

## Description

![[chardon-towers-1.png|right|400]]As the coastal fog lifts, the first thing you see is the great black bulk of [[Mount Nera]] looming over the city to the north, the occasional glint of light highlighting the obsidian flows that dot the distant slopes of this long extinct volcano. A spur of [[Mount Nera]] cuts south towards the [[Chasa|Chasa River]], which spreads into a wide estuary and fertile floodplain towards the coast to the west. 

The bustle of the busy port on the [[South Bank]] dominates the soundscape of the city - the cries of sailors, the crack and snap of rigging and sails being set, the creak of ships sailing on the morning tide. Downriver of the mercantile wharves rises the Arsenal’s inner mole, sealing off a separate naval basin whose slipways are hidden from prying eyes..

On the [[North Bank]] of the river, in the shadow of [[Mount Nera]], weirs and waterworks are mixed with numerous short, squat buildings of black stone, emitting an acrid stench. These are the [[chalyte]] refineries, the source of much of Chardon's wealth, the buildings where the dirty and dangerous work of turning the raw chalyte ore shipped from the north into precious fuel for the magical works of the city takes place. Few live by choice amongst the dirt and stench of these refineries, but this doesn't stop the spread of slums along the [[North Bank]], filled with those who have no other options, hemmed in by the chalyte works downriver, and the walled estates upriver, beyond the spur of [[Mount Nera]] that shelters the rich from the noise and stink of the refineries. 

The vast arch of the [[River Bridge (Chardon)|River Bridge]] provides the main route across the [[Chasa]]. Wide enough for four carts to pass abreast, and enchanted to rise as needed to allow ships to pass, steady foot traffic passes under the watchful eyes of the [[Praecanti Vigiles]] - traders, chalyte dealers, wizards and scholars, farmers with goods for market, and many more. Upriver, the [[Chardon Bridge]] is used more by locals, farmers as well as the rich and powerful. Smaller, series of twelve arches, this bridge marks the height of navigation for tall-masted sailing ships, although riverboat traffic is frequent here.

The [[South Bank]], where the bulk of the city lies, is dominated by the hundreds of towers of Chardon, concentrated in the south and east of the city, where the Great Library stands. But many other sights and spread across the city: the three great markets and dozens of smaller markets, the Imperial Palace, the Cathedral of the Eight, The Pillar of Victory, Haldir's Tomb, the Hospital of the Mother's Grace, as well as other churches, monuments, and palaces scattered across the skyline.

## History

Chardon has grown by alternating periods of slow accretion and swift expansion. As one of the only major cities on the west coast that has never been conquered, Chardon has long been a beacon of safety during times of war and chaos.

### Founding

Conventionally, Chardonian scholars date the beginning of the city of Chardon to the construction of a small Drankorian fortress on the spur of [[Mount Nera]] in DR 609, during the [[Drankorian Western Wars]], although given the protected harbor, rich natural resources, and easy climate, it is very likely that settlement in the area long predates the coming of the [[Drankorian Empire]]. Over the next 450 years, Chardon grew slowly, primarily through the influx of scholars and wizards curious about the secrets that [[Mount Nera]] might hide. 

- (DR:: 609): Fort Chardon, on the [[Chasa|Chasa River]], is constructed by [[Drankorian Empire|Drankorian]] armies to protect a sheltered harbor. 
- (DR:: 644): Chardon reaches a population of 1000 people, as a small settlement grows in the shadow of [[Mount Nera]], primarily serving as a local market town and safe harbor along the [[Chasa]].
- (DR:: 688): The [[Great Library]] is founded on the south bank of the [[Chasa]] by the [[Sibylinites]].
- (DR:: 732): Chardon reaches a population of 2000 people as an influx of scholars and wizards drawn to the [[Great Library]] settle on the south bank. 
- (DR:: 844): With the population swelling, the [[Chardon Bridge]] is constructed with Drankorian magic to link the growing academic and magical community to the port and military fortifications on the north bank. 
- (DR:: 939): The [[University of Chardon]] is founded; the population of Chardon reaches 5000 people. The first stone walls are constructed, enclosing what is now [[Precinct IV]]. 

### Refuge from the Fall

The [[Fall of Drankor]] marked a major turning point in the history of Chardon. Many fleeing the destruction of the heartland of the [[Drankorian Empire]], and especially many wizards and scholars, fled west and settled in Chardon. Though the major economic engine of the post-fall years was the growing mercantile empires to the west (in [[Apporia]]) and the north (on the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]), Chardon became a major center of learning and a convenient safe harbor through which the goods of the [[Chasa River Valley]] flowed during these years. 

- (DR:: 1059): Large numbers of refugees fleeing the [[First Plague]] settle in Chardon, swelling the population to 20,000, with more arriving every year. The first timber wharves on the [[South Bank]] are constructed. A wooden palisade is constructed to protect the rapidly growing population, enclosing much of what is now Precinct III, V, and VI. The defensive fortifications on the north bank are expanded. 
- (DR:: 1072): The population of Chardon reaches 40,000 people. The wooden palisade is expanded and replaced with a stone wall. 
- (DR:: 1099): The population of Chardon reaches 60,000 people. Many wooden wharves on the south bank are replaced and rebuilt with stone. Chardon is becoming a major market where grain from the fertile [[Chasa River Valley]] is traded with merchants from the growing naval power of [[Cedrano]]. 

### Growth of Industry

Starting in the DR 1200s, the industrial might of Chardon begins to grow. It is during this era that the [[River Bridge (Chardon)|River Bridge]] is built, the paper mills become established on the [[North Bank]], and Chardon becomes known not just as a center of magical learning but a place of skilled craft as well. 

- (DR:: 1324): The population of Chardon reaches 100,000. The walls are expanded and reconstructed, forming the current old city walls, enclosing Precincts I - VI. 
- (DR:: 1366): The growing paper industry on the [[North Bank]] necessitates extensive water works. The [[Mill Channel]] is constructed. 
- (DR:: 1374): The [[River Bridge (Chardon)|River Bridge]] is constructed to relieve traffic on river crossings. 

### The Great War and the Blood Years

During the years before the [[Great War]], Chardon was a major city, primarily known for the renown of its wizards. It emerged from the [[Great War]] as the last bastion of safety on the west coast, despite nearly falling during the [[Conclave War]]. During the years that followed, the population of Chardon swelled with refugees, the massive outer walls of the city were constructed, and the northern wall was built.

### Imperial Capital 

Chardon emerged from the [[War of the Dark Rift]] as the capital city of a small, and growing, empire, and the most significant maritime power on the west coast. During the years that followed, the economic might of Chardon grew dramatically, especially after the discovery of [[chalyte]] in the north in the late 1600s.

## Urban Geography

Chardon is organized into 21 administrative precincts, as well as a number of unincorporated suburbs south of the city. 

Precincts I - VII are the inner core of the original Drankorian city, and are enclosed by the walls constructed during the expansion of the city in the 1300s. The modern port is largely congruent with [[Precinct VI]]; the university district is Precinct IV; the imperial administrative center is in Precinct I. 

Precincts VIII - XVI form the outer core of the [[South Bank]], numbered from VIII in the southwest to XVI in the northeast. Precinct VIII is adjacent to the naval arsenal; Precinct X houses the massive Kylos Market.

Precincts XVII - XXI are on the [[North Bank]]; while Precincts XVIII and XIX are inside the north walls, XVII, XX, and XXI are the administrative units for the northern suburbs, with XVII containing the largest part of the chalyte refineries and the slums of the [[Riverside Quarter]]. 

To the south of the city, extensive suburban development is not incorporated into the adminstrative precincts, and instead represents a patchwork of arrangements. 

East of Mount Nera on the north bank, the [[Nera Domains]] are a collection of private estates and lordly manors of the rich and powerful. 

%% rough history of how things got this way
historically, the north bank was where the drankorian fort was built, and generally the slopes of mt nera were infertile and hard to work, so there was not major incentive for early settlement. when industry begins to grow in the years after the fall of drankor, the city needs the money, and since the land is largely lightly populated and technically all originally claimed by the drankorian legion (gone, but a legal fiction the chardonian ruling council uses to assert control), the north bank is divided into administrative wards and taxed; in exchange the city funds the construction of water works to support the mills. this remains largely industrial land, until after the great war. during the blood years, the north ring wall is built and army barracks constructed; more recently as the mills turn to chalyte refineries, barracks are sold and repurposed as worker housing. but since this was all part of the pre-imperial chardonian tax base, during the adminstrative reforms around 1600 that create the current precincts, these areas are included. in the south, the situation is very different. during the long peace from the 1200s-1400s lots of settlement grew outside the old city walls (constructed in 1300s). during the great war, a number of suburbs were incorporated and the added tax revenue used to construct the outer walls. however, in the past 100 years as safety returned many of the legionary generals and other landowners who held low-value land (during the height of the wars building was not allowed near the fortifications) have now seen local suburbs grow but are not willing to give up their priveledges for to be incroporated.

## Trade and Economy

%%
Chardon is the center of a growing empire, and its economy is based on trade, magic, and knowledge production.

Chalyte mining feeding into production of common magic items is a big deal; Chardon, more so than other places, has a very "magic" feel to it, with cleansing stones and other common items around a lot

Long distance ocean-based trade also tends to run through Chardon, which competes with halfling fleets to brave the dangerous seas and trade for exotic stuff with the islands to the west or even the journey through the perilous waters south of Dunmar to reach the southern part of the continent

## Government 

%%
Runs "in the name of the Emperor," but doesn't actually have an Emperor right now. Instead, a secretive council of mages runs the city ?

Magistros: 'offical' ruler

Chancellors and consuls: council members ; consuls serving in frontiers, inculding proconsuls who are governors of terroritories/provineces

In Drankor, the magistros were councillers to the emperor, members of mages council etc

Praecanti Vigiles --> the mage guard / city watch, technically of the people

Praecanti Primis -> the magistros personal mageguard and fundamental source of power

So: the Magistros runs the city in the name of the Empire, is the commander of the Praecanti Primis and the Praecanti Vigiles, and has the power to appoint individuals to positions in the bureaucracy.

Chancellors control varies aspects of the city (Chancellor of the Navy, Chancellor of Coin, Chancellor of the Guard traditionally an office held by the Magistros Chancellor of Libraries, Chancellor of ….)


Details of the civil administration not super important to work out, but feeling should be lines of hierarchy, etc.
%%

## Key Organizations

%%

The civil administration controls a lot, and the Praecanti, especially the Praecanti Primis is a powerful force, mostly of spellcasters
