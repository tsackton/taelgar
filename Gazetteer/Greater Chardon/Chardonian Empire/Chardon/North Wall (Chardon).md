The North Wall describes the fortifications, constructed during the [[Great War]] and the [[Blood Years]], that encircle Precincts XVIII and XIX on the [[North Bank]] of the [[Chasa]], enclosing the neighborhoods of [[Bastion Quarter|Bastion]], [[Summit Quarter|Summit]], and the [[Chalyte Levels]]. 

%% notes
defense against hobgoblins to the north, was major fortification and part of extensive defenses on Mount Nera
now less important as defense, obviously, as the north road leads into the heart of the empire
