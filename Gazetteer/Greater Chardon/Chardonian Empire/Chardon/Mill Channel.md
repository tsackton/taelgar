The Mill Channel is the largest of the canals and waterworks that connects the refineries of the [[Ragwater Basin]] to the [[Chasa]]. It cuts through the [[Bastion Quarter]], passing under the [[~North Coastal Road (Chardon)~|trade road]], and then exits the walls via the [[River Gate North (Chardon)|River Gate]]. From their, it loops west before veering south to reconnect with the [[Chasa]] downstream of the main port and the naval arsenal.
