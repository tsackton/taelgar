The Merchants's Gate is the principal gate through the [[North Wall (Chardon)|North Wall]] by which the northern trade road enters [[Chardon]]. The neighborhoods immediately inside the gate—especially the [[Bastion Quarter]]—are full of inns, taverns, and warehouses catering to river and overland merchants.
