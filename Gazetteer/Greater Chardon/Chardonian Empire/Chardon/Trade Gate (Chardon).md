The Merchants's Gate is the principal gate through the [[North Wall (Chardon)|North Wall]] by which the northern trade road enters [[Chardon]]. The neighborhoods immediately inside the gate—especially the [[Bastion Quarter]]—are full of inns, taverns, and warehouses catering to river and overland merchants.

Don't love the name.  It is the largest gate in the north wall, but not clear how much traffic actually comes overland, vs via coastal ship. It is probably only the immediate hinterland that is sending wagons through the north gate. The north road was heavily fortified and mostly destroyed during the hobgoblin years, too.
