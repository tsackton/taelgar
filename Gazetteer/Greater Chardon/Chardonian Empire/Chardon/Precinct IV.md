Precinct IV is the academic quarter of [[Chardon]], famed for its towers, lecture halls, and libraries. It contains the [[University of Chardon]] and is closely associated with the [[Great Library]].

In addition to the ordinary bustle of a city neighborhood—inns, taverns, and lodgings—Precinct IV is shaped by the presence of many scholars and mages, including a number of distinctive wizard towers.
