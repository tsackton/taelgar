# Precinct IV

Precinct IV is the academic quarter of [[Chardon]], famed for its towers, lecture halls, and libraries. It contains much of the [[University of Chardon]] and is closely associated with the [[Great Library]].

In addition to the ordinary bustle of a city neighborhood—inns, taverns, and lodgings—Precinct IV is shaped by the presence of scholars and mages, and by the rules on magical practice promulgated by the [[Hetaeri Magica]].
