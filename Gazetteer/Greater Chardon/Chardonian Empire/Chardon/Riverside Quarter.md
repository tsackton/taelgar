The Riverside Quarter, often just called Riverside, is a neighborhood nestled against the [[Chasa]], south of the [[Ragwater Basin|Basin]] and west of the walled part of the [[North Bank]]. This area is poor, smelly, and often floods during the highest tides, and only the most desperate live here. 

Riverside together with the [[Ragwater Basin|Basin]] makes up Precinct XVII.
