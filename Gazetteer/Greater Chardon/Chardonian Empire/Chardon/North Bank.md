# The North Bank

The North Bank refers to the neighborhoods of [[Chardon]] on the north side of the [[Chasa|Chasa River]]
.

The dominant geographic feature on the North Bank is [[Mount Nera]], a long extinct volcano, with a conic summit peak of basalt and obsidian, rumored to be deeply magical. While the bulk of the mountain itself rises some distance from the river, a sharp spur runs north-south between the summit and the river, dividing the North Bank.

To the west (downriver) of the spur, the land slopes steeply down to a flat lowlands along the [[Chasa]]. Historically much of this area was dominated by paper mills, with several mill streams and canals cut to redirect water from the [[Chasa]]. In the present day, this industrial infrastructure has largely been repurposed for [[chalyte]] refining, though the area is still known as [[Ragwater Basin]], though this is often shortened to just the Basin. The largest canal, the [[Mill Channel]], now carries riverboats of raw [[chalyte]] ore from [[Voltara]] directly to the refineries for processing.  

During the [[Great War]] and the [[Blood Years]], the [[North Wall (Chardon)]] was built, running along the height of the [[Mount Nera]] spur, then cutting in two broad switchbacks west and turning in a broad sweep to encompass most of the lowlands, excluding the industrial [[Ragwater Basin]]. The [[Mill Channel]] runs through the middle of the walled area, exiting the walls to the west via a [[River Gate North (Chardon)|river gate]]. 

Originally this area was devoted largely to military use. In the current day, the westernmost section of the walled area, near the river gate and towards the [[Chasa]], is referred to as the [[Chalyte Levels]] and is a notable slum, with old barracks repurposed as low-quality housing for workers in the refineries. The slums that spill out of the walls, merging with the dirtiest parts of the [[Ragwater Basin|Basin]], are called the [[Riverside Quarter]] or just Riverside. 

The central part of the walled area, known as the [[Bastion Quarter]], and centered around the [[Trade Gate (Chardon)|Merchant's Gate]], is richer, dotted with inns and taverns catering to the trade that enters the city from [[~North Coastal Road (Chardon)~|north road]]. Here the land begins to slope upwards along the spur of [[Mount Nera]]. As the land slopes upward, the [[Bastion Quarter]] transitions to the area known as the [[Summit Quarter]], where respectable houses dot the streets and artisans make a living above the stink of the lowlands along the riverbank. 

East (upriver) of the fortifications along the height of land of the [[Mount Nera]] spur, the land is hillier and dryer, and this region, known as the [[Nera Domains]], is dotted with elaborate manors of the rich and prosperous. 

Two major bridges cross the [[Chasa]], connecting the North Bank to the bulk of the city to the south. 
- The farthest downriver, connecting the [[Bastion Quarter]] to the [[Precinct VII]], is the [[River Bridge (Chardon)|River Bridge]], a massive arching bridge, with an enchanted mechanism allowing the middle section to be be raised for tall-masted ships to pass under, and wide enough for four wagons to cross abreast. 
- Upriver from the [[River Bridge (Chardon)|River Bridge]] is the [[Chardon Bridge]], marking the height of navigation on the [[Chasa]], and connecting the [[Summit Quarter]] to  [[Precinct VI]]. 

These bridge crossings are supplemented by numerous ferries that dot the shores of the [[Chasa]].
