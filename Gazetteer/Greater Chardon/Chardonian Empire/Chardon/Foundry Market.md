# The Foundry Market

The Foundry Market is a rough-and-tumble, dawn to dusk, daily open market in the [[Chalyte Levels]] slums, occupying a cleared casting-yard at the western edge of the district, just inside the [[North Wall (Chardon)|North Wall]]. It serves refinery laborers and nearby residents with stalls selling coarse bread, dried fish, second-hand clothing, reclaimed firewood, and simple iron tools repaired from refinery scrap. Hiring corners operate at first light, where foremen select day workers for kiln maintenance, slag hauling, and other piece-rate tasks.
