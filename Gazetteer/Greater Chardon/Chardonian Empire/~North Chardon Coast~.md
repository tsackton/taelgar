# The ~North Chardon Coast~

The North Chardon Coast is the long stretch of coastline north of [[Chardon]], forming part of the heartland of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. Much of the coast is known for farms and small ports, supplying the imperial capital by road and sea.

In the years after the [[Great War]] and the [[Blood Years]], tales tell of hobgoblin conquest and hard-fought reconquest along this coast, before the region settled into its modern role as an imperial heartland.

- Needs a name - long stretch of smooth sandy beaches running 800 miles north of Chardon
    
- Sandy beaches, leading to land of rivers and farms and pastures, breadbasket of Chardon
    
- Small stands of ancestral forests but mostly land with a long history of agriculture
    
- Land slopes up to low hills maybe 150-200 miles inland
    
- Relatively few big cities; perhaps one or two in the north? Not sure yet about urbanization in this area. Open to develop. 

- Generally part of the "core" of the Chardonian Empire and generally Chardonian rule is popular here. 

- NOTE: There is a lot of DM information about the history of this region both pre-Great-War and in the aftermath of the Great War, including its eventual incorporation into the Chardonian Empire. Basic current day vibe and geography is accurate if undeveloped.
