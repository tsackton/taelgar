## Dwarven Coins

%% This was linked from a bunch of places so I figured I should just clean it up and make it real %%

Dwarven mints in the kingdoms of [[Nardith]], [[Nidzahar]] and [[Am'khazar]] produce both coins and trade bars in a variety of denominations. Dwarven trade bars, stamped with a known weight of silver or gold, are commonly used for large transactions in [[Dunmar]], [[Sembara]], and the [[Zimka]] realms. 

Dwarven coins are minted in gold and silver in a variety of sizes and values. Dwarves also mint and produce iron trading coins, known as nibs, that are backed by a gold standard but not otherwise containing any intrinsic worth.

Dwarven coins were very common during the [[Great War]] and are therefore often found in ancient treasure hordes.

2 sp

 Nibs in 5 sp, 1 gp, 10 gp, and 50 gp are known.
