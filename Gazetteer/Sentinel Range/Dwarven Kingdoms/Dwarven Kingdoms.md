# The Dwarven Kingdoms
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`  
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

The Dwarven kingdoms of the [[Sentinel Range]] have a long, deep history. Once, all the land under the mountains was part of the great Dwarven empire, stretching from the southern end of the mountains to the  far north. The heart of this empire was in the area that, in the current day, is just south of the devastation around the ancient [[Urlich Pass]]. 

During [[The Downfall]], when [[Hkar]] fell and great wars were fought in the depths underground below the mountains, the Dwarven empire was shattered, and many of the deeper cities were abandoned. However, many [[Dwarves]] survived, and while the [[Drankorian Empire]] was being established aboveground, the Five Kingdoms were growing below and among the [[Sentinel Range]].

## [[Ardith]]
In the far south, south of [[Urlich Pass]], is [[Ardith]], growing rich on trade with [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], and later with [[Dunmar]], until at the end of the [[Great War]] they were driven from their homes and settled south, in the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], founding [[Nardith]]. Now destroyed. 
## [[Khatridun]]
_Labeled DK2 on the map_

North of [[Ardith]] is the kingdom of [[Khatridun]], centered on the great city of [[~DwCity1~]], one of the oldest Dwarven cities in the world during the Drankorian Era. During the [[Great War]], [[Khatridun]] was devastated, and [[~DwCity1~]] was destroyed. Now, a remnant of this ancient kingdom survives on the border of [[Sembara]]. Once rich and prosperous on the trade between [[Sembara]] and [[Chardon]], [[Khatridun]] now looks inward to Dwarven history and the legends of the past.  

## [[Am'khazar]]
_Labeled DK3 on the map_

West of [[Khatridun]] is the kingdom of [[Am'khazar]], roughly "rich-iron-mountains." [[Am'khazar]] has always been the center of mineral wealth in the [[Sentinel Range]], with deep mines and a rich trade in gemstones from [[Zarkandur]], the City of Gems. 
## [[Nidzahar]]
_Labeled DK4 on the map_

In the current era, [[Nidzahar]] is the largest and richest of the dwarven kingdoms, known widely across the [[Western Green Sea]] and even as far as [[Chardon]] as the source of a wide range of expertly crafted goods. [[Nidzahar]] is the most technologically oriented of the dwarven kingdoms, and has the most extensive surface settlements. 
## [[Fahnukan]]
_Labeled DK5 on the map_

In the far north, the dwarven kingdom of [[Fahnukan]] is strange and isolated, with little contact with the southern dwarven kingdoms for the past many generations.

Additional details, not fully worked out:

The basic plotline: historically, the southern kingdoms ([[Ardith]] and [[Khatridun]]) were the center of power, the oldest/richest kingdoms, dating back to even before the founding of [[Drankor]], while Am’khazar to the northwest got by on trading mineral wealth while [[Nidzahar]] was a bit of a hippy backward (such as things exist in dwarven society). Then the [[Great War]] upends things, as the center of [[Khatridun]] is destroyed and all of [[Ardith]] is wiped out. The [[Ardith]] [[Dwarves]] flee south to the Yuvanti, while the [[Khatridun]] turn inward looking for clues in dwarven history to recover what was lost and restore the golden age of [[Dwarves]]. [[Nidzahar]], in contrast, looks to the [[Humans|human]] world and innovation, building on its artisan and craft-based traditions to push technological innovation. Throughout this, the kingdom of Am’khazar (the most traditional ‘dwarfish’ kingdom) chugs along on tradition and mining, while the weird, isolated [[Dwarves]] of the north remain weird and isolated. 

Elsewhere in the world, of course, there are other dwarven kingdoms, but historically the five kingdoms of the [[Sentinel Range]] have been the center of dwarven culture and the largest population centers of [[Dwarves]].

## Overview

  

The Dwarven kingdoms of the ~CentralMountains~ have a long, deep history. Once, all the land under the mountains was part of the great Dwarven empire, stretching from the southern end of the ~CentralMountains~ to the far north. The heart of this empire was what is now the area south of ~Ulrich Devastation~.

  

After the events at the end of the ~ThirdAge~, when Hkar fell and great wars were fought in the depths underground below the mountains, the Dwarven empire was shattered, and many of the deeper cities were abandoned. However, many dwarves survived, and during the ~FourthAge~ the five great Dwarven kingdoms were established.


- In the far south, south of ~Urlich~, is Ardith, growing rich on trade with Drankor, and later with Dunmar, until at the end of the Great War they were driven from their homes and settled south, in the Yuvanti mountains, founding Nardith.
    
- A bit further north, Khatridun, centered on the great city of ~DwCity1~, which dates to early in the ~SecondAge~, one of the oldest surviving Dwarven cities during the ~ThirdAge~. While this kingdom suffered greatly in the Great War and the destruction of ~Urlich Monastery~, including the loss of ~DwCity1~, a remnant of this ancient kingdom survives on the border of Sembara. Once rich and prosperous on the trade between Sembara and Chardon, now the most history-oriented of the Dwarven kingdoms in the ~CentralMountains~.
    
- West, Am'khazar, focused on mineral wealth and mining (roughly, rich-iron-mountains). 
    
- North, Nidzahar, the largest and richest of the Dwarven kingdoms in the ~FifthAge~, trading a wide range of crafted goods with the highland kingdoms and Sembara. Also most surface-oriented of the dwarven kingdoms. 
    
- Even farther north, Fahnukan, the northern dwarves, culturally distinct and isolated since even before the great war.

## The Kingdoms

These are quick summaries so far; will flesh out as time, interest, and campaign need allows.

  

The basic plotline: historically, the southern kingdoms (Ardith and Khatridun) were the center of power, the oldest/richest kingdoms, dating back to even before the founding of Drankor, while Am’khazar to the northwest got by on trading mineral wealth while Nidzahar was a bit of a hippy backward (such as things exist in dwarven society). Then the Great War upends things, as the center of Khatridun is destroyed and all of Ardith is wiped out. The Ardith dwarves flee south to the Yuvanti, while the Khatridun turn inward looking for clues in dwarven history to recover what was lost and restore the golden age of dwarves. Nidzahar, in contrast, looks to the human world and innovation, building on its artisan and craft-based traditions to push technological innovation. Throughout this, the kingdom of Am’khazar (the most traditional ‘dwarfish’ kingdom) chugs along on tradition and mining, while the weird, isolated dwarves of the north remain weird and isolated.

  

Elsewhere in the world, of course, there are other dwarven kingdoms, but historically the five kingdoms of the ~Central Mountains~ have been the center of dwarven culture and the largest population centers of dwarves. 

### Nardith

The Kingdom of Ardith was once the great and prosperous southernmost kingdom in the central mountains, trading with the Dunmari, the people of the Istare river valley, and even the mysterious Myraenians. However, with the end of the Great War and the destruction that followed, this kingdom was entirely destroyed, and all that remains are ruins, lost mines, and forgotten roads in the deep.

  

Many of the people of Ardith fled south, crossing the Dunmari plains to settle in the Yuvanti Mountains, and founding the new kingdom of Nardith (new Ardith). The Yuvanti, newly risen from the plains of Dunmar, turned out to be easy to mine and full of mineral wealth, and the Kingdom of Nardith has grown prosperous over the past century, trading with Dunmar and Chardon. 

  

The Nardikhun, as the people of Nardith are called, bear the memories of the loss of their ancient homes and the flight across the open land, and many remain concerned with the fate of their lost heritage. But, the new land has been kind to them, and many have prospered with traditional Dwarven crafts of mining and smithing. Many Nardikhun have taken to exploring the deep hidden secrets of their new home and as such Travelers are common among the generation born in the Yuvanti. 

### Khatridun

The Kingdom of Khatridun was once the greatest, oldest, and most powerful of the five kingdoms. Rumored to be the first place where dwarves settled in the world, none could deny the ancient history of the Kingdom of Khatridun. At their height during the Great War, the Kingdom of Khatridun lost more than any kingdom, excepting the destroyed Kingdom of Ardith, during that time. The ancient city an capital was destroyed in the destruction that followed the death of Cha’mutte, and many soldiers from Khatridun lost their lives defending dwarves, and humans, and others.  
  

In the aftermath of the Great War, Khatridun has turned inward. Much of its former wealth was lost as trade between the east and the west all but ceased, and never blessed with excessive mineral wealth, the people of Khatridun turned inward and to their history, looking for lost knowledge from a prior age to help them rise again. 

### Am’khazar

The Kingdom of Am’khazar has always been a quiet but wealthy kingdom. During the height of the five kingdoms before the Great War, it was never as powerful as Khatridun, and in the years since it has not risen to the heights of Nidzahar. But the Am’khun have always been quietly prosperous off their rich mineral wealth, which they trade primarily with other dwarven kingdoms. The kingdom of Am’khazar is in many ways the most Dwarvish of all the five kingdoms, seeming untouched by time or the world shaking events around it, always content to continue their traditional ways and live life as they always have lived. 

### Nidzahar

Historically, Nidzahar, was a backwater, a minor kingdom of not much importance, which is even reflected in its name, which loosely translates simply as ‘east-land’. Nestled along the easternmost edge of the mountains and spreading into the lightly settled highlands of Sembara, the Kingdom of Nidzahar was never particularly populous or prosperous. Lacking the mineral wealth of Am’khazar and the trade connections of Ardith or Khatridun, before the war the kingdom of Nidzahar was of little importance, known largely as a place of iconoclasts, thinkers, and artisans. 

  

After the Great War, as the center of dwarven wealth and civilization in Khatridun and Ardith fell ot war, Nidzahar attracted most of the trade with Sembara that remained, turning the raw mineral wealth of Am’khazar to the west into armor, weapons, and stranger innovations. Now, Nidzahar is the largest and most technologically advanced of the five kingdoms. 

### Fahnukan

northern, isolated both before and after the war, much less interested in human contact than others, allies of stoneborn, weird volcanic interests? Haven’t thought much about them except they are odd. Perhaps live mostly on the surface despite the cold and north? Have winter homes in the mountains, summer homes on the slopes?
