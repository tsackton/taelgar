Nidzahar, loosely 'east-land', is one of the five [[Dwarven Kingdoms]] of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]]. It is located predominately on the eastern side of the mountains, loosely bordered by [[Fahnukan]] to the north, [[Am'khazar]] to the west, [[Zimkova]] to the east, and [[Khatridun]] to the south. Nidzahar is the largest in area of the [[Dwarven Kingdoms]], but is primarily settled along its eastern border. 
## History

Although Nidzahar's history, like all the kingdoms of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], stretches far back to the very beginnings of time, long before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], for much of its existence it was something of a backwater, a minor kingdom, neither populous or prosperous. Lacking the mineral wealth of [[Am'khazar]] to the southwest, and the trade connections of [[Ardith]] or [[Khatridun]] to the south, Nidzahar was historically known primarily as a place of iconoclasts, thinkers, and artisans.Â 

After the [[Great War]], the center of dwarven wealth and civilization in [[Khatridun]] and [[Ardith]] fell, and Nidzahar attracted most of the trade with [[Sembara]] that remained, turning the raw mineral wealth of [[Am'khazar]] to the west into armor, weapons, and stranger innovations. Now, Nidzahar is the largest and most technologically advanced of the five kingdoms.

## Culture and Economy

Nidzahar has long been a place that attracted tinkerers, technologists, artificers, and others seeking to push the foundations of dwarven skill and knowledge. Although not a place of fabulous mineral wealth, like [[Am'khazar]], in recent years Nidzahar has become something of the workshop of the [[Dwarven Kingdoms]], and has rapidly filled the economic vacuum left by the collapse of [[Ardith]] and destruction of parts of [[Khatridun]] at the end of the [[Great War]].
