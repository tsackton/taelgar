A closed city in [[Ursk]], one of the few places foreigners are allowed to dock and trade. It is a sprawling city with high walls and extensive coastal fortifications, including several massive stone wave breaks. The foreign trading posts are set on a protected spit of land, but exit from the docks and storehouses of the foreign city is forbidden and the whole area is patrolled by masked wizards. A great gate stands at the end of the peninsula, guarded constantly. Zakat is 1300 miles as the crow flies from Tollen, longer by ship.
