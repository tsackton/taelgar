A mysterious closed city in the north, part of the country of Ursk, where none are allowed across the bridge from the harbors and warehouses to the main city, and the people trade dragon hide.

The harbor and trading posts are on an island of the coast, connected to the mainland by an impossible bridge, a single span of stone with no obvious supports. Masked wizards patrol the bridge and one feels as if they can see you even if they are not looking in your direction.
