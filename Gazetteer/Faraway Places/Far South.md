# The Far South

In the markets of [[Tollen]] or [[Chardon]], rumors are occasionally heard of great lands faraway to the south and east, where creatures as tall as castles roam and the air is sticky and wet. Others tell of an endless desert, where oases bloom with flowers the size of trees, but death awaits those who lose their way in the endless heat and sand. What truth there are to these rumors is not known.
## Map

{link to leaflet map of region}
## Topography and Major Features
This region is shrouded in mystery, and only a few features are rumored. Many reports of a [[~Great Desert~|endless desert]] stretching for thousands of miles have come west, but beyond that, few know what mysteries this region holds.

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
[[Kenzo]] brought stories of a tropical jungle called [[Orekatu]] by the [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] who dwell there.
%%^End%%
## Civilizations and Cultures
What civilizations live in this region, beyond -- or within -- the desert is not known.
## Climate
The climate of this region is varied, and not well known - but all the stories tell of hot and humid, or hot and dry places. 

%%^Campaign:None%%
There are no real canonical details about this region's climate although it is exclusively subtropical and tropical. The [[~Great Desert~]] is similar in size and climate to the Sahara; [[Orekatu]] has a tropical jungle feeling, perhaps similar to Panama.

## Major Historical Eras
_See more: the [[Founding of Dunmar]]_

Nothing is known of the history of this region. Any people who live here are likely strange and foreign compared to the descendants of [[Drankor]]. The [[Dunmar|Dunmari]] claim to have come east from somewhere in this region soon after the fall of Drankor, but the exact location of the ancient Dunmari homeland has been lost.

## DM Notes and Meta
*Area:* This region is poorly defined as little geographic development exists, but functionally it is everything east of the [[~Eastern Mountains~]] and south of the Green Sea coastal realms. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The swamps and jungles of [[Orekatu]] have some basic canonical development, primarily on geography and climate. There is canonically a great desert somewhere in this region. Dinosaurs canonically live in [[Orekatu]], at least, and are in some cases partially domesticated by [[Lizardfolk]]. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* Gnomes are generally thought to inhabit this region, but details are vague. Hints of an ancient trading civilization (Targu) exist, but details are vague / non-existent. The Dunmari homeland is likely in this region, although the exact location is unclear.

*Needs Development:* None. 

*Intentionally Blank:* This area is explicitly left blank and should not be developed without careful consideration. 

*Adventures:* The Kenzo solo arc from the Dunmar Frontier campaign was set in western Orekatu and the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]] immediately to the west of [[Orekatu]], but otherwise this region has seen no play time. 

*Important Places in Staging:* None.
