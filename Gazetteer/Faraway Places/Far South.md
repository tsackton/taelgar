## Overview

Largely untouched by the [[Great War]], the lands of the south contains deserts, jungles, and mystery. 

## Boundaries

- To the north, this region is bordered by the northern edge of the [[~Great Desert~]].
- To the east, this region is bordered by the [[~Eastern Ocean~]].
- To the west, this region is bordered by the eastern edge of the [[Sea of Storms]] and the hills and badlands that mark the eastern edge of the [[Istaros Watershed]]

Little is known about the southern reaches of this region.

## Major Features

This region is shrouded in mystery, and only a few features are rumored. 

- [[~Great Desert~]]: *A vast desert, analogous to something like the Sahara.*
- [[Orekatu]]: *Lizardfolk jungle from Kenzo solo, described as analogous to something like Panama, generally tropical jungle of some kind.*

## Climate

The climate of this region is varied, and not well known, but is exclusively subtropical and tropical.

*Area:* This region is poorly defined as little geographic development exists, but functionally it is everything east of the [[~Eastern Mountains~]] and south of the Green Sea coastal realms. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The swamps and jungles of [[Orekatu]] have some basic canonical development, primarily on geography and climate. There is canonically a great desert somewhere in this region. Dinosaurs canonically live in [[Orekatu]], at least, and are in some cases partially domesticated by [[Lizardfolk]]. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Gnomes are generally thought to inhabit this region, but details are vague. Hints of an ancient trading civilization (Targu) exist, but details are vague / non-existent.

*Blank Regions:* This area is explicitly left blank and should not be developed without careful consideration. 

*Adventures:* The Kenzo solo arc from the Dunmar Frontier campaign was set in western Orekatu and the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]] immediately to the west of [[Orekatu]], but otherwise this region has seen no play time.
