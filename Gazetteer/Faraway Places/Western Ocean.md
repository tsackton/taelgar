## Map
## Topography and Major Features
The [[Endless Ocean]] continues for uncounted and untracked miles, and no other features are known in this region, although some suspect the sunken remains of [[Hkar]] may lie somewhere out in the deeps.
## Civilizations and Cultures
It is commonly believed that [[Merfolk|merfolk]] live in the oceans here, but few have actually visited any of their cities or underwater realms. Travelers sometimes report strange islands after being lost in a storm, but no one has mapped these far reaches, and many believe the [[Endless Ocean]] is empty of all land.
## Climate
This region is entirely ocean, mostly temperate. The near shores are relatively navigable, but the farther reaches of the ocean are dangerous. Storms and currents are unpredictable, and few have returned from voyages west. 

%%^Campaign:None%%
The ocean is broadly similar to the western Pacific. A warm current runs north of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], and a cool current (similar to the Humbolt, but running southward instead of northward) runs past [[Apporia]].

## Major Historical Eras
Little is known of the history of the oceans, although legend says that the ancient [[~Mariners~]] left Hkar and crossed the [[Endless Ocean]] to reach the [[Green Sea]]. Many speak of the lost birthplace of humanity, the now sunken island of [[Hkar]], but where it lies is not known.

## DM Notes and Meta
*Area:* The borders of this region, especially as compared to the [[Far South]] are not clear, nor is it clear where places like the sunken ruins of Hkar belong. Broadly, this is expected to be the "unknown western ocean" and perhaps more complex and distant ocean areas would require a new region. In the current day, this includes all places in the Endless Ocean, but the region page is named differently to avoid conflicts.

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* There are no canonical facts about this region except that [[Merfolk]] are known to live here; an ancient and important merfolk city, [[Omi]], is in this region. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* It is expected that whatever development occurs around the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] will be based on an early [[~Northerner~]] migration from Hkar, but this is not canonical. Potentially the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] do not even exist.

*Needs Development:*  None.

*Intentionally Blank:*  The [[~Sayuna Islands~]] are best left undeveloped until needed for a game. 

*Adventures:* The merfolk arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign traveled to [[Omi]], but otherwise this region has not see any actual play time. 

*Important Places in Staging:*  None.
