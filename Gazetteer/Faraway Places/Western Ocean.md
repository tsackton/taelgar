%% maybe does not need a map? but probably should have an in-world-style opening paragraph %%

The halfling story of the Western Ocean is one of mystery and adventure, fantastic voyages, and strange sightings far from land. Even among halflings, few captains dare sail into west, braving the uncharted currents and winds of the [[Endless Ocean]]. Many who do never return. But sometimes ships bring back wild tales: of hidden islands, cities beneath the waves, and giant creatures of the depths.

## Topography and Major Features

The [[Endless Ocean]] is unmapped and uncharted even by the best halfling navigators, stretches for uncounted and untracked miles. No definitive features are known in this region, though sailor's yarns and the shanties speak of rumors of sunken ruins, perhaps the remains of [[Hkar]], somewhere out in the deeps. 
## Civilizations and Cultures
Halfling songs, especially those of [[Apporia]] and [[Mawar Confederacy|Mawar]], sing of [[Merfolk|merfolk]] who live in the oceans here, but few concrete reports come from those who actually visited any of their cities or underwater realms. Many a halfling captain, sailing far beyond the sight of land, has reported strange sights -- birds that should not be seen far from land, wind and currents that hint at nearby shores. And some report strange islands after being lost in a storm. But no one has managed to map these far reaches, though many have tried, and many halfling sailors believe the [[Endless Ocean]] is empty of all land.
## Climate
This region is entirely ocean, mostly temperate. The near shores are relatively navigable, but the farther reaches of the ocean are dangerous, and few sailors venture needlessly far into the west. There, storms and currents are unpredictable, and few have returned from voyages west. 

%%^Campaign:None%%
The ocean is broadly similar to the western Pacific. A warm current runs north of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], and a cool current (similar to the Humbolt, but running southward instead of northward) runs past [[Apporia]].

## Major Historical Eras
Little is known of the history of the oceans, although halfling songs speak of the ancient [[~Mariners~]], who left Hkar and crossed the [[Endless Ocean]] to reach the [[Green Sea]]. Many speak of the lost birthplace of humanity, the now sunken island of [[Hkar]], but where it lies is not known.

## DM Notes and Meta
*Area:* The borders of this region, especially as compared to the [[Far South]] are not clear, nor is it clear where places like the sunken ruins of Hkar belong. Broadly, this is expected to be the "unknown western ocean" and perhaps more complex and distant ocean areas would require a new region. In the current day, this includes all places in the Endless Ocean, but the region page is named differently to avoid conflicts.

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* There are no canonical facts about this region except that [[Merfolk]] are known to live here; an ancient and important merfolk city, [[Omi]], is in this region. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* It is expected that whatever development occurs around the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] will be based on an early [[~Northerner~]] migration from Hkar, but this is not canonical. Potentially the [[~Sayuna Islands~]] do not even exist.

*Needs Development:*  None.

*Intentionally Blank:*  The [[~Sayuna Islands~]] are best left undeveloped until needed for a game. 

*Adventures:* The merfolk arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign traveled to [[Omi]], but otherwise this region has not see any actual play time. 

*Important Places in Staging:*  None.
