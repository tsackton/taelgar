# The Far North

Far north, beyond the northern lands of [[Vostok]] and [[Ursk]] lies a mysterious land of long winters and bitter cold. Rarely visited, even rumors from this region rarely reach the populated lands of the south. The stories that do reach the south tell of frost-breathing dragons, obsidian statues as tall as the hills, and singing caves of ice that devour unwary travelers. More prosaic stories of wooly mammoths with heavy ivory tusks and short summers filled with rushing snowmelt and clouds of gnats as far as the eye can see have also come south. Who is to say which stories are true?

## Topography and Major Features
Few have mapped this region, and little is known about the lands. A few features are well-attested:

* A [[~Far North Steppe~|cold, dry steppe]] north of [[Vostok]] and the [[Grastenvakt|Gr√•stenvakt]]
* A [[~Far North White Dragon Mountains~|range of mountains]] north of the [[Ket]], said to be the birthplace of [[Vimfrost]] and home to many frost-breathing dragons
* A [[~North Ursk River~|river system]] that drains from the [[~Far North White Dragon Mountains~]] to the eastern [[Green Sea]]

## Civilizations and Cultures
Although rumors persist of [[Kenku|kenku]] flying across the [[~Far North Steppe~|nothern steppe]], few can say where exactly these winged creatures live. 
## Climate
This region of Taelgar is nearly entirely within the subpolar or polar climates, a mix of [vast subarctic forests](https://geodiode.com/climate/subarctic) and [barren tundra](https://geodiode.com/climate/tundra). But few rumors or tales come to the south from these regions, and in the distant north, who knows what strange magic may sustain life in unlikely places?
## Major Historical Eras
Little is known of the history of this region, although [[Vimfrost's War]] was partially fought here.

## DM Notes and Meta
*Area:* This region is poorly defined as little geographic development exists, but roughly speaking it includes everything north of the [[~North Bay~]] coast, [[Pandar]], [[Vostok]], and the [[Ket]], and then follows an arbitrary line north of the Green Sea east of [[Ursk]]. In general, permanent 'normal' human civilizations should be south of this region, although of course an arctic culture is possible.

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* This region, particular the mountains north of [[Ursk]], are home to many white dragons, including the descendants of [[Vimfrost]], which has significant influences both on this area and regions to the south. A large number of [[kenku]] canonically make their home on the [[~Far North Steppe~]], on the eastern slopes the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] north of [[Zimka]] but few details have been developed. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* The area north of [[Vostok]] is tentatively invented as a subarctic grassland - like the interior Canadian plains / northern Great Plains - large mammals, cold winters, mammoths - and tentatively assumed to be a place where kenku settled after escaping from Pandar. However, details are vague, at best, and the geography / climate is not set in stone. 

*Needs Development:* None. 

*Intentionally Blank:* The entire region is largely blank on purpose. Any human civilizations here would be highly magic or scattered and small, and not likely to impact other cultures or the grand sweep of history. 

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region.

*Important Places in Staging:* None. The features this far north plausibly have no known names in the southern lands.
