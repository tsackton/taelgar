### The Monastery of Bhishma

A monastery complex dedicated to [[Bhishma]] about 2 1/2 miles south of [[Kharsan]]. Houses the [[Hall of Stories]], the records of the Dunmari people. 

### Description

The monastery complex is sitting on a bluff near a turn in the river. The southern edge is cliffy as it drops down to the river floor, while the west is a gentle slope down to the river, formerly a thriving garden and farm for the monastery. There is a newer path with a few stone steps that has been constructed from the dry river bed up the slope, and the remains of stairs cut into the side of the cliff. Here can be found the remains of the old [[Bhishma]] mystai settlement.

Because of the slope of the land, the temple is the most prominent building from any direction, with the tower attached to the hall of archives also notable. The one story cloisters and kitchens and the baths and workshops sit low and are less notable architecturally (from the outside, at least). The two dormitories, with space for several hundred monks in residence, are elegant three story buildings, but don't reach as high as the temple or the hall of archives.
