> a city in [[Chasa River Valley|the Chasa River Valley]], [[Chardonian Empire]]

Arendum is a substantial provincial town, with a frontier vibe. Built on the ruins of a former city-state, [[Kin-Aska]], which was a Chardonian satellite, a mixed Northlander/Drankorian culture with good relations with the nearby Deno'qai tribes in the forests, as well as the elves.
