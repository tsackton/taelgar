### The Chardon Canal

Variously referred to as the [[Chardon]] Canal, the Old [[Chardon]] Canal, the Great [[Chardon]] Canal, or just the Canal, this is an 87 mile long sea-level canal that connects the Endless Ocean near [[Chardon]] with the Emerald Bay and the [[Nevos Sea]]. 

Built with magic by the Drankorians, and currently navigated by windcallers, who use magic to steer ships through the often windless passage.
