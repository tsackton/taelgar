# Erelion
*air-lee-on*

## Overview

An ancient elven city in the kingdom of [[Orenlas|Orenlas]], claimed by many elves to be the oldest continually occupied settlement on Taelgar. 

Erelion is a living city, growing in and among the ancient forest of Orenlas. Elaborate towers appear to grow from the surrounding trees and landscapes, their walls adorned with vines, leaves, and flowers. Bridges woven from living vines connect various parts of the city, allowing elves to traverse the canopy with grace. At night, the paths of the city are lit by bioluminescent plants and animals, their soft, soothing glow casting a dreamlike aura over the city.

Erelion is not organized around any plan or into distinct districts; it has an organic and magical feeling, where path part to reveal hidden gardens and secret pools. However, there are a few primary features and places in the city.

## The Elder Tree
A vast tree, standing at least 600 feet heigh, and measuring over 100 feet in diameter at its base, that grows in the center of Erelion. Vines and flowers cover the lower reaches of the tree, while the canopy spreads to cover the center of the city, with a diameter of 1000 feet or more. 
## Fey Gardens
Erelion contains many hidden and unexpected gardens, often with unusual magic. Some perpetually maintain a particular season, while others rapidly turn from season to season over the course of a day, or a week. Ponds, waterfalls, and blooming flowers are a frequent feature of these gardens, and fey creatures are not uncommonly seen. Many of these gardens are in perpetual twilight, their serene pools reflecting the stars. 

## Starlight Observatory
While most of the city of Erelion is flat and forested, in the southeast corner a long, tall escarpment of white quartz rises a few hundred feet. Set on this bank is an observatory, a place to contemplate the stars and the magic of Elmerca. 

## Dream Sanctuaries
Throughout the city are a handful of dream sanctuaries, ethereal spaces where elves can enter trance-like states to share dreams and experiences. Elven artists and scholars often visit these sanctuaries to seek inspiration from the collective unconscious of their people. One dream sanctuary is called **Lómelindë**, the Glimmering Grove, where vibrant flowers bloom and one can dream of colors that have no name.
