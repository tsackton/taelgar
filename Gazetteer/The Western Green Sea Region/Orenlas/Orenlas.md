The ancient elven kingdom of Orenlas is the last remnant of [[AlcarinquÃ«]], one of the great elven civilizations of the ancient days. Orenlas is one of the few places in the world where the magic of the ancient days of myth still lingers. Here can still be found the great dreaming trees of the elves, still echoing the ancient song of Aldanor. 

Orenlas proper occupies the forest southeast of ~LakeCymeanMountains~ and southwest of ~CymeanMountains~, north and eat of the [[Plaguelands]], an area about 140 miles east to west and 80 miles north to south. Dense mists cling to these woods, and the trees listen. It is rumored that those who are unwelcome find paths closed to them, turned in circles until they find themselves outside the forest again. Those who would do harm and led to more permanent fates. 

Walking through the forest, however, creates a sense of timelessness. The days turn to nights, but hours don't seem to pass at a constant rate, and it is easy for a week to feel like a day, or a day a week. The seasons and the weather are only loosely related to the outside world. There is a faint echo here of the days of creation, before time began, and when the gods still walked the earth. 

While many elves live in small settlements in Orenlas, there is one major city, called [[Erelion]], that is claimed to be the oldest continually occupied settlement on Taelgar.
