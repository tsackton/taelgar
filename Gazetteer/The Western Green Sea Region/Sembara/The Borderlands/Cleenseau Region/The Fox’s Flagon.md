### The Fox's Flagon
 
 A three story inn popular with traders and merchants, but often quiet when no caravan is in town. Known for neither its food (go to [[The River’s Blessing]] for that), or drink ([[The Bandit’s End]] is recommended), it is nonetheless a comfortable, secure, and dry place to sleep, and it has a large innyard and stables for travelers horses.
