# Zovcka

%% Notes
-   Isolationist and wants to be left alone  
-   In some of the higher steppes, still speak the old east northlander and a major reserve of worshippers of the old gods
-   A strong cultural tradition of staying out of larger politics and wanting to be left alone. 
-   Low population density
-   Hunting still important in some regions, although hardy grains (i.e. barley or an analog) and wooly mountain goats/sheep are the main food source.
- Strong connection to stoneborn and kestavo
