# Temple of Kaikkea

An ancient building in [[Tollen]], one of the original structures, once outside the city walls, but later incorporated into the city. Dedicated to the Skaer goddess [[Kaikkea]], and used by the Skaer, who maintain a presence here. 

Made of white marble, with walls like undulating waves.
