# The Western Green

The Western Green Sea region refers to the areas clustered around the Western Gulf and the more westerly parts of the Green Sea.

The Western Green Sea  is dominated by the Kingdom of Sembara and Tyrwingha, a personal union of the two most important kingdoms, which dominates the political universe. North of Sembara lies the Highland Kingdoms: Zovcka, to the far north, Breva, to its south, and Lavnoch and Ardlas to the north and south of long Lake Derwent at the headwaters of the River Semb. To the west, the high peaks of the [[~CentralMountains~]] reach to the sky, forming an almost impassable boundary. To the east, the Green Sea beckons, and merchant ships ply its calm waters, carrying trade from [[Cymea]], a land of city-states and ancient wizardry, Skaegenland, the cold northern islands, home to the independent and proud Skaer people, and exotic lands further east.

Along the northeastern border of the Kingdom of Sembara runs the mighty Volta River, dividing Sembara from [[Vostok]], a land of many rivers, bitter winters, and small kingdoms. At the mouth of the Volta sits the Free City of Tollen, an independent city-state known for its merchant guilds, scholarship, wizards, and free-wheeling culture, a blend of the fierce independence of the Skaer, the ancient learning of Drankor, and the commercial and mercantile prowess of the Sembaran Northlands.  

South of Sembara, beyond the Mostreve Hills lie the Plaguelands, a desolate and accursed land, still not recovered from an ancient curse.

The region is blessed with mild weather, amble rain, and rich fertile soil. Largely unchanged by the upheavals of the Great War, farmers plant winter wheat and summer millet and soybeans largely as they have for thousands of years. Five major river systems, fed by the summer rains, and melting snowpack and glaciers from the mountains, define the region: in the northeast, the Kem and Niva rivers spill down from the northern plateau across [[Vostok]]. Further west, the mighty Volta, wide and cold, flows past Tollen into the Green Sea. South of the Volta is the swift flowing Teft, then the placid Semb, and finally the southern Wistel and Enst rivers, which merge in the great marshy delta of Ozabal, home to a large community of Lizardfolk.

The rise and fall of the land further defines the region: in the west, the towering [[~CentralMountains~]] rise thousands of feet into the air. Few travelers cross these high peaks, save on the guarded underground roads of the dwarves. East of the mountains lie the Sembaran Highlands, a rough land that slowly descends to the Aine and Braebine Hills. East of the highlands is the Great Central Plain, a vast flat plain, stretching from the Mostreve Hills in the south to the Volta River in the north. North of the Teft, the plain stretches toward the mountains until the Northern Highlands start to rise up. In the west, the plain ends along the line of the Aine and Braebine Hills. In the east, it ends just east of the Volta River, as the land rises to the ~VostokHills~ before descending again to the flatlands of central [[Vostok]].

### Climatic Overview

The climate of the region is shaped by several major factors:

-   In the summer, warm winds blow from the Green Sea, bringing heavy rain and muggy air   
-   In the winter, a high pressure system develops over the northern plateau, and the winds come from the west over the [[~CentralMountains~]]. This is a cold and dry season.
-   The Green Sea, in the east, provides a moderating influence, especially on the coastal plains.

In general, the region’s climate is temperate, with four distinct seasons, dry winters, and wet summers. During the summer months, a monsoon wind blows from the Green Sea, bringing ample rainfall. In winter, high pressure builds over the northern steppe, and the west winds that blow over the mountains are dry and cold.
