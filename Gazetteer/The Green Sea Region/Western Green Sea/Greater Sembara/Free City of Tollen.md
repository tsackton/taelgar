# The Free City of Tollen

A bustling port on the Volta River, which forms the border between [[Sembara]] and [[Vostok]], the Free City of Tollen is an independent city-state. Founded thousands of years ago, it has navigated the politics of the region and maintained its independent for centuries. It is a haven for merchants, traders, intellectuals, mages, and scholars, and is known for its university as well as its reputation as a trading port. Sailors from Tollen ply the Green Sea, bringing back goods from near neighbors as well as the far East. 

## History

Tollenders are deeply proud of their long history, and many will claim that Tollen is the oldest continually occupied human city in the world. Whether true or not is hard to know, but regardless Tollen's history stretches deep into the past.

### Founding

Tollen was originally founded on the north bank of the Volta river by the first mariner migrants from Hkar, before the Downfall, in the year 3902 by the Dwarven reckoning. Although the western edge of the Green Sea, and the Western Gulf, is originally something of a frontier backwater, over the next 100 years Tollen becomes a center of commerce and trade, a place where the mariner culture, the northern culture of the highlands, and the non-humans (lizardfolk and halflings, mostly) of the western Green sea mingle. Even in this early age, Tollen was a religiously open and cosmopolitan place, and the worship of Meriskar, the ocean god of the early mariners and now the Skaer people, coexisted with the developing Kestavan tradition.

### Downfall and Rebirth

In 4050s, the Downfall Wars begin, and Tollen is cut off from the eastern Green Sea, as long voyages become too dangerous. The ocean itself turns violent, as storms wrack the seas and the great swamps to the south start to dry. By 4122, when the Downfall Wars have ended, Tollen is virtually abandoned, and the land that will become Sembara depopulated, settled by scattered villages of farmers, with Embry and a few other river towns among the only significant population settlements.

By the 4200s, the Skaer have established themselves as the dominant mariner culture in the western Green Sea, and resettle and rebuild Tollen. Over the next 300 years, the Skaer grow stronger, spreading along the coast as far south as the mouth of the Semb, raiding upriver for timber and impressed sailors to row their great ships, and seeking converts for their religion. Tollen develops as a major trade center for the emerging Skaer empire, and begins to grow again.

### Drankorian Influence

In 4491, the Drankorians reach the Mostreve Hills, and over the next 50 years or so the Drankorians assimilate the inland people of Sembara and push the Skaer out, bringing with them the Mos Numena and the traditions of their vast southern empire. 

In 4547, the Drankorians and the Skaer sign a peace treaty, establishing the Volta as the frontier of the Drankorian Empire. Tollen, on the north side of the Volta, remains technically outside the Drankorian territorial claim. However, the Skaer are forbidden from bringing ships up the Volta, and Tollen falls outside their sway and comes under the influence of Drankor. While technically Tollen takes the name of the Free City of Tollen during this time, the Drankorian Empire controls its foreign policy as a protectorate.

By the 4600s, during the Long Peace, Tollen begins to assert more autonomy. By now it has become a mixing place of Drankorian, Skaer, and Highlander culture, with diverse religious practices and where many languages can be heard. During this era the first merchant houses are established, becoming rich off the trade of dyed cloth south to Drankor, and the development of magical tattoos, especially those that could help sailors control the wind and sea.

In the 4800s, as Drankorian expansion to the west begins in earnest and the might of the empire is focused to the east, the Tollen merchant houses have de facto control over Tollen, and Tollen has become a major city and one of the central mercantile powers of the western Green Sea. It is during this era that the University of Tollen is founded.

### The Fall of Drankor and the Growth of Sembara

When the Plague strikes, while Tollen is spared the worst of the chaos that envelopes the south, but plenty of chaos remains, and various wars and conflicts spiral out of control. While the university survives, and the city itself, most of its wealth is lost as trade is disrupted, and Tollen falls into a dark age. Little is recorded from the time between the Plague in 5192, and the late 5300s, when the Sembaran kings begin to grow in power.

As Sembara expands in the south, Tollen recovers, and over the 5400s and 5500s Tollen experiences a renaissance of sorts, based on the growing wool and linen trade from the Sembaran heartlands. The lost art of magical tattoos are rediscovered and most of the merchant houses of Tollen today are established during this time period.

In the 5600s, war comes to the Green Sea, first the battles against the ancient white dragon Vimfrost, and then the Great War itself. Tollen, however, survives intact, and if anything grows in power and influence, as many of the Sembaran kings in the years after the Great War have ties by blood or marriage to the great houses of Tollen.

Now, in 5881, Tollen commands a significant navy and is the undisputed master of the Western Gult, controlling the Straights of Cymea and asserting influence over much of western Cymea.

## Geography

![[IMG_0919.png]]
Tollen sits astride the Voltra river. Most development is on the north side, which is rockier, less marshy, and generally less prone to flooding, with the south side more recently developed and generally poorer. The height of navigation is considerably upstream of Tollen, although there are few good anchorages for large oceanic ships upriver. 

The terrain around Tollen is characterized by rocky, gently rolling hills to the north and west, and swampy, marshy lowlands to the south and east. The western part of Tollen stretches into reclaimed marshlands, and is prone to tidal flooding, while the eastern and northern parts are drier. The exception is Haurhill, the area around an old Drankorian fort. 

There are four small tributaries of the Volta that flow through Tollen:
1. The Little River, to the west; the largest of the Tollen rivers. In the past few hundred years has been diverted into a canal and dammed. 
2. The <> River, flowing from the south, ...
3. The <> River, ...
4. The <> River, ...

Tollen is traditionally divided into 17 wards:

### The Skaer City

The original settlement by the mariners, as later expanded by the Skaer after the Downfall wars, was a small city, surrounded by a embankment and a wooden wall, set on the north side of the Volta. It mainly functioned as a port for timber and other goods leaving the Volta watershed. 

Skepwalk: North side of the Volta, easternmost (oceanside) district. Excellent harbor area, where a curve in the river creates a wide, deep anchorage. Name derives from old Eastros word for docks; this is the westernmost ward on the north side of the river, and among the oldest docks and shipyards in the city. Now a major shipbuilding center.

Fiskurth: North side of the Volta, northwest of Skepwalk. Name derives from old Eastros for fish, one of the oldest districts in the city, although little is preserved of that time. Many taverns, and a hub of activity for sailors. Largest fish market, and other scattered market streets, but somewhat "low class". 

Aesganstrad: North and west along the river from Fiskurth; with Fiskurth and Skepwalk forms the ancient core of the pre-Drankorian city. Name derives from Aesgan, a semi-mythical Skaegish hero who is said to have protected/resettled Tollen during the chaos after the Downfall. Best preserved of the ancient districts, now home to many of the craft guilds, especially the powerful dyer's guild.

### The Drankorian City

After the treaty of 4547, Tollen prospers. Most of the Skaer bitter about Drankorian influence are driven north and east, into their ancestral strongholds in the islands of the western Green Sea, and Tollen becomes a key mixing place and trade center for the rich raw materials flowing from the mountains and forests of the hinterland to the growing cities of the Drankorian Empire in what is now Cymea and Sembara. During the pre-treaty conflict, the city is sacked and the wooden walls burned; after peace is established, the first stone walls of the city are built, and the city expands north and west. 

Bridgeward: West of Aesganstrad, and north of the great Tollen Bridge, build by the Drankorians to facilitate trade from the south and connect to the great Drankorian road stretching south to Sembara. Historically and in the present day a major market center, with shops, artisans, and lots of commerce. 

Southbridge: south side of the Volta, upriver (west) from Battery, the area south of the Tollen Bridge. Now the center of dyeing trade, and home to most of the tattoo parlors (magical or otherwise) in the city. Originally settled during the Drankorian era, and thus one of the oldest parts of the city, but retains little of its ancient character now. 

Magus Street: Often just called Magus. East of the old city (Fiskurth, Skepwalk, Aesganstrad), away from the river. In Drankorian times, home to small library and university outpost, which grew over time. Technically older than the University of Chardon, although it was abandoned for a number of years after the fall of the Drankorian Empire, and reestablished as Tollen returned to prosperity in the early days of Sembara. 

Nordgate: North of Aesganstrad and east of Bridgeward, around the original north gate of Tollen. Now one of the major dwarven districts in the city. 

### The Sembaran City

After the fall of the Drankorian Empire, there was a major economic disruption in the Green Sea, and Tollen suffered. The population of the city shrunk, the University drifted apart, and many Drankorian structures fell into disrepair. However, in the 5300s and 5400s, as Sembara grows, Tollen experiences a major economic boom, rapidly growing. 

Godshome: West of Nordgate, along Temple Street where many different houses of worship to different gods are found. Grew around (some kind of religious complex pre-existing outside the walls in the Drankorian days, perhaps).

Gold Street: West along the river from Bridgeward. Home to banks, and with Guildgate the heart of the growth boom experienced in pre-Great-War era. 

Guildgate: North and inland from Gold Street and Bridgeward, around the Guild Gate and home to many of the city's richest and most powerful merchant guilds and families. Dotted with extensive palaces of merchant houses.

Fairgate: West of Guildgate, inland from the Volta. Halfling neighborhood, sometimes split into Fairgate Inner (inside walls) and Fairgate Outer (outside walls), as in the past hundred years or so the population has begun to spill out of the walls.

Haurhill: rise of land, name means "hill hill" in Eastros and Westros. Height of land within Tollen and site of early fortifications (a Drankorian fort sat here, guarding the lumber yards at the confluence of the Little River and the Volta).

### The Current City

Tollen escaped the Great War largely unscathed, and has continued to grow in the past 200 years, despite the ups and downs of Sembara in this time. The city walls were expanded again to the west, and the city has now begun to overflow the walls. 

Battery: south side of the Volta, and on the easternmost (ocean) side of the city. Notable for the river fortifications that protect the main harbor; not densely populated, although small naval docks and barracks are here. Mostly dates to wars just before the Great War, when Tollen was in alliance with Sembara against the dangers of the north. 

Fenslane: south side of the Volta, upriver (west) from Southbridge, along the bend in the river. Former tidal marshland reclaimed and settled mostly by dyers, tanners, and other similar artisans expanding from Southbridge. Reasonably new.

Tideswell: south side of the Volta, upriver (west) from Fenslane. A marshy area that floods on the high tide, mix of poorer/slums and lizardfolk communities.

Brooklawn: West of Haurhill, a swampy and wet area where the Little River was dammed and diverted into a canal. Also often separated into Brooklawn Inner (inside the walls) and Brooklawn Outer (outside the walls). Fairly poor, slummy area. Brooklawn Outer is where much of the leatherworking and tanning happens, so smelly. Tanner's Gate separates Brooklawn Inner and Brooklawn Outer, and Brooklawn Inner is also referred to as Tannersgate.

Riversgate: furthest west district, along the river. Also separated into Inner and Outer, with Riversgate Outer a center of timber trade coming down the Volta.

## Bridges and Gates

Only one bridge spans the Volta. The Tollen Bridge, the ancient Drankorian bridge, still standing, with a huge stone drawbridge, lined with shops and activity. 

There are eight gates in the current walls, from east to west: Old Gate, Scholar's Gate, North Gate, Temple Gate, Guild Gate, Fair Gate, Tanner's Gate, River Gate.

Old Gate stands where the original pre-Skaer mariner fortication stood, defending the harbors of Skepwalk. But of course has been rebuilt many times. Scholar's Gate and North Gate are part of the original Drankorian Stone wall. The fourth Drankorian Gate was demolished when the city expanded after the fall of Drankor. North Gate, Temple Gate, Guild Gate, and Fair Gate are part of the pre-Great-War boom time walls. Tanner's Gate and River Gate are the most recent additions after the wall expanded west once more. 

## Governance and Laws

Tollen is an open city: there are no tolls to enter, and the gates are kept open from dawn until dusk. There are fees, tolls, and tariffs on goods crossing through Tollen, market sellers, and considerable income is made via licensure of guilds and other professions and crafts. But from an adventurer's perspective, there is little to stop someone from wandering in. There is no registration, etc.

Formally speaking, "foreigners", are prohibited from carrying blades larger than a dagger, and prohibited armor, but in practice this is rarely or never enforced as long as the rule is not flaunted, and especially it is unlikely to be enforced against members of the Elder races, who are perceived to be no threat to the city. The city gates are guarded, but not tightly.

The city is technically a republic, with government by a council elected from the various guilds. (Details probably don't matter too much)

## Guilds

(not sure the details matter...there are lots of guilds, both major and minor, and they are important to the economics and politics of the city)

## Landmarks

The bridge, of course; some temples; the university; what else? Maybe a theater. Guildhalls. Markets? Probably some kind of palace associated with the government, maybe with a major clock tower. 

## Notes

-   Masters of the Western Gulf. Significant fishing and merchant fleet. Strongest navy in the Western Gulf and major fishing industry (whales? Cod? Not sure what the key fish would be. Also no lenten red meat rules to drive a cash crop fish industry, so maybe not quite as developed as say the Basque medieval fisherman who got rich on cod)
    
-   Controls a narrow strip of land on the north bank of the Volta as well as the Tollen city proper, and the coastal islands in the greater Tollen harbor.
    
-   Controls the Straits of Cymea, main seafarers in the Western Gulf
    
-   Manufacturing esp of clothes key. Silk (or cotton or a made up fiber) from Tyrwingha and wool from Sembara comes to the Tollen + northlands region to turn into fine clothes
    
-   Big dye industry in the hinterlands
    
-   Influential in the northlands more than anywhere else and somewhat culturally connected to that region (although with a clear, distinct identity)
    
-   Some significant far eastern trade, although that in general is probably more halfling/Cymean; Tollen is however a major market for Cymea traders, who exchange goods from around the Green Sea for Sembaran/Tollen cloth/silk/clothes.
    
-   University in Tollen is major center of magical learning in the Sembara/[[Vostok]] region, only some parts of Cymea could compete in western Green Sea area. Dye industry + magic makes Tollen a center of development of magical tattoos.
    
-   In many ways more cosmopolitan than Sembara; significant local halfling, lizardfolk, and dwarven communities, and stoneborn are not unheard of. Elves still super-rare.
