# Evis

The northernmost settlement in [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] along the Great South Road. Evis is a fortified frontier town on the border of the March of Evis, ruled by the aging Marcher Lord, [[Peyre Vayler]], and his two daughters. South of Evis, the land turns more fertile, and more populated, before eventually reaching the rolling valleys near Valarin, where most of the people of the Duchy of Maseau live.
