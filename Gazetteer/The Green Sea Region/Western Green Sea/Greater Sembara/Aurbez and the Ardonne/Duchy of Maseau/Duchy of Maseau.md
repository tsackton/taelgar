# The Duchy of Maseau

This land is a borderland and was essentially depopulated during the Great War. It was never a land blessed with rich natural resources, and before the Great War thrived on the trade flowing through the gap in the Mostreve Hills. During the war it suffered significant population loses, and to the extent that it recovered, it was from refugees who fled north from the fall of [[Insingue]] and the [[Istabor Alliance]].

Now it is a frontier land and haven for refugees from the Great War, now resettled for generations. It is still a wild place though, and the frontier is near. Raiding hobgoblins from the Plaguelands are a yearly occurance and peace is hardwon. South of the Duchy is a wild and little settled land, but small bands of frontiersfolk live, especially along the Aurbez plateau. This area was devasted in the Blood Years, and many abandoned mines in the mountains provide easy riches for those brave enough to venture far from civilization. The people of the Aurbez plateau largely hail from the lost city of Insingue, now a ruin amidst the Plaguelands.

The capital, Valarin, is the largest city in the Duchy, although the border towns along the Great South Road -- in particular, Cassons, in the south, and Evis, in the north, are, despite their small size, notable.

%% Notes to incorporate from Tim
I think also the region south of the Mostreve hills on the central mountains side of the gap would plausibly be a place where natural resources are abundant, and perhaps even deceptively easy to get via abandoned dwarven mines and things like that, so this loose alliance of refugees, mountain folk, some scattered halflings and such, is growing a bit supported by these resources. I also imagine the Rangers providing some covert -- or perhaps overt -- support here and also to what is probably otherwise the relatively poor kingdom of “Southern Marches 2".

    
-   Originally the Sembaran Duchy of Maseau, but it was largely abandoned during the plague years by the sembaran crown. But the duke and their family ended up kinda forming a refugee welcoming committee and it became known as a place for the homeless and the lost folks of the Great War. Perhaps a key place for the rangers now who have some of that vibe. However, the hobgoblin conquests in the 1580s could have impacted to make this place much more militant. Maybe now it is a bit like Israel -- highly militarized with a chip on their shoulder about past suffering and how this can’t ever happen to our people again
