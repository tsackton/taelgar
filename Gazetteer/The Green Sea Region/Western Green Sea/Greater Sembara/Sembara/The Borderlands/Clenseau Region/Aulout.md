### Aulout
*population 102*

A poor fishing village on the banks of the Enst, a short walk from [[Clenseau]]. It is nestled on reclaimed marsh between the Great South Road, Amance Brook, and the Enst. About a mile downriver from Clenseau, just before the road crosses the Amance, it is part of the manor of the Lord of Clenseau. About a dozen boats fish for river trout in the spring and summer, from a makeshift dock rebuilt each April. 

The twenty houses here flood at times, save for the sturdy mill, built on the banks of the [[Amance Brook]].
