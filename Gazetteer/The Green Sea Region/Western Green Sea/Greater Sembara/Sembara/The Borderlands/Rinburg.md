A trading town at the head of navigation of the River Enst. A busy ferry crosses the river here, and it is one of the few points to cross the river until [[Clenseau]], a hundred miles further west. The landscape around Rinburg is pastrol fields and farms, and there is much good sheepland within two days ride.
