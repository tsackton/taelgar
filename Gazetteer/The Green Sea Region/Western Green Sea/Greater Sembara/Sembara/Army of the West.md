### The Army of the West

The Army of the West numbers 4,000 soldiers, divided into a North Watch, Center Watch, and South Watch. The South Watch is the largest at 1,600 soldiers; the North and Center Watches are 1,200 soldiers each. Each watch is in turn divided into two companies, for a total of six companies.

The Army of the West guards the western borders, and is significant in Dunfry, Ainwick, and the Marches of Enford, including responsibility for the occasional patrol of the largely uninhabited border along the Enst. The farthest garrison east is in [[Clenseau]], which although technically in the [[Barony of Aveil]], is just on the border of the two baronies and a bit of a melting pot town.
