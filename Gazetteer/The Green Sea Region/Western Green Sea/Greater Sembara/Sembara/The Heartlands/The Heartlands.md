# The Sembaran Heartlands

The heartlands are a rich agricultural region in the lowlands between the Enst, in the south, and the [[River Teft|Teft]], in the north. Much of this region, around the River Semb, is the [[Duchy of Sembara]], a powerful and rich farming region, control of which is the source of much of the monarchâ€™s power. This land is the breadbasket of [[Sembara]].

Four other powerful duchies make up the rest of the heartland: the [[Duchy of Wisford]], around the [[River Wistel|Wistel]] River and stretching south to the Enst; the Duchy of Arnsbury, in the north; the [[Duchy of Cheimen]], in the west between the Semb and Wistel rivers; and the [[Duchy of Seham]] along the coast.

Perched on a bluff above the River Semb, the capital city of [[Embry]] is a bustling river port of approximately 50,000 souls. It is home to the royal court, trade missions from much of the Green Sea, and bustling markets. Dating to Drankorian times, the city boasts that it has never been taken by siege, and the great northern gates are said to have been built by ancient Drankorian magic. It sits along the Great North Road, a major road running from Wisford, on the [[River Wistel|Wistel]] River, north to [[Embry]], across the [[River Teft]], and finally to the Free City of Tollen.
