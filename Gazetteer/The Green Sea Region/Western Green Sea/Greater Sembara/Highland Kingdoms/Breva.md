A highlander kingdom.

%% Notes 
 -    A small kingdom, and in some ways riven by the most internal tensions.     
-   On the borders of the northern highlands (Zovcka), the western highlands (Lavnoch), and the northlands of Sembara.    
-   Probably has the least cohesion of any of the highland kingdoms, and a weak king -- perhaps mostly a figurehead. Some of the nobles might be more aligned with the north, or the west, or the east and this could be a good place for political intrigue and so on.    
-   Perhaps little true cultural cohesion and a lot of challenges being organized. The northern landowners who live in the rising slopes of the north plateau are really more aligned with Zovcka; the ones in the west with Lavnoch, and the southern parts with the northlands    
-   Might work to have it a little bit smaller than it is on the map, moving up the northlands
