# Skaerhem

Skaerhem, called Skaegenland by the Sembarans, is a collection of islands (the Skaer Islands), many volcanic, and the nearby coastline in the northwestern corner of the Green Sea. This is a land of frequent storms, rocky land, and difficult seas, but also a region teaming with marine bounty, and rich in rare volcanic metals and precious stones. 

The Skaer, sometimes called the Skaegish, are an ancient people, an insular society descended from the original mariner migrants who left Hkar and settled the Green Sea before the Downfall. They, unlike any other inhabitants of the Green Sea, retain the worship of the ancient mariner ocean goddess, Kaikkea.
