%% have some additional color notes, especially about south and northwest %%

The Sentinel Range, also called the Sentinel Mountains or the Sentinels, is the extensive mountain range that separates the [[Green Sea]] and the surrounding lands from the [[Greater Chardon|west coast]] of Taelgar.

The [[Sentinel Range]] stretches 2300 miles from volcano mountains of the former kingdom of [[Pandar]] in the north, to the northern foothills of the Dunmari plains in the south. 

### Northern Sentinels
- The northern section, from roughly [[Pandar]] south past the [[Forest of Nightmares]] to the area northeast of the [[Blackwater Fens]], is snowy, rocky, and volcanic, marked by pine forests on the western slopes and long, bitter winters. 
		- ***Real world analogs:*** This region is at approx. 52 degrees north, and probably has some similarities with the Canadian Rockies, especially Banff and Jasper national parks, including the flat plains to the east of the mountains (int he [[Far North]]). The volcanic mountains of [[Pandar]] share some similarities with the Pacific Ring of Fire, but with a much more magical vibe, and less moderating coastal influence on climate. 

### Central Sentinels
 The middle section, roughly the area starting west of [[Zimkova]] and running south to the desolation west of the [[Western Marches]], is rocky and very tall, with extensive underground development associated with the [[Dwarven Kingdoms]], and more dangerous things. These are stereotypical high mountains. 
		- ***Real world analogs:*** This region stretches from roughly 40 degrees N to 50 degrees N. This is a classic high mountain range, sharing features with the northern Rockies, the Alps, and Patagonia, but even the tallest peaks are unlikely to reach the heights of something like the Himalayas in the real world. 

### Southern Sentinels
The southern section, covering the area that was once the dwarven kingdom of [[Ardith]], from roughly west of [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] or [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] to the end of the [[Sentinel Range]] north of [[Dunmar]], is full of high, barren peaks that rise sharply from the plains, and is generally dry, with arid regions to the west and south. 
		- ***Real world analogs:*** This is warmer and further south, from approx. 34 degrees N to 38 degrees N. Probably shares some similarities with the dry Andes, or possibly some of the mountains in central Asia, such as Hindu Kush or Pamir Mountains. 
	- The northern and middle sections are separated by a region of lower hills, a more habitable region with mixed forests and rocky slopes, but relatively easy passage between the west and east. This is likely the route by which the early northerners crossed into the Sembaran highlands. 
		- ***Real world analogs***: Perhaps somewhat similar to something like the less mountainous Yellowstone / Montana, or even perhaps the Whites. 
	- The middle and southern sections are separated by the desolate of Urlich, created by [[Cha'mutte]]'s death. What this actually looks like is currently unknown, but it is dangerous and contains both random isolated mountains and vast chasms, and safe travel is impossible, not only because of dangerous inhabitants but because of unstable terrain. 
		- ***Real world analogs:*** None, although perhaps some bits of Mordor could be a reasonable mental model. 
	- Passes: the [[Sentinel Range]] is easily crossable only in a few places. 
		- To the north, the gap between the middle section and the northern section is traversable in all seasons, but lightly settled; the northern section itself is extremely inhospitable in the highest peaks.
		- The middle section has passes around [[~High Horn~]], west of the [[Highland Kingdoms]], and in the area west of the [[Western Marches]]. But the latter was disrupted by [[Cha'mutte]]'s death and is no longer considered passable. 
		- The south section has several routes that cross between the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] and northern [[Dunmar]]. 

In the south, in northern [[Dunmar]], the mountains are steep and rocky, with only a handful of passes. In the winter, they are snow-covered, but there is little permanent ice and few or no glaciers. 

Further north, the mountains are somewhat less rugged, but high enough in places to be permanently snow-covered. 

Major settlements of [[Dwarves]] and [[Stoneborn]] call the Sentinels their home, and historically this area was, and is, the center of Dwarven civilization. 

The Sentinels have many names: they are called the Indalas by the [[Stoneborn]], Labkhan by the [[dwarves]], Beredri by the [[Deno'qai]], and Tushara by the Dunmari. 


%% OLD NAME NOTES
Brainstorming name ideas

I like Labkhan or Labkar in dwarvish and the Sentinels/Citadel Range/ some variant for English - Mike

Many large/prominent mountain chains in real world have some derivation around "White" or "Snowy"(e.g. alps, Himalayas). 

If we take a Deno'qai perspective, this could be something like:
Lavan (white in hebrew), or variants like Lavnal / Lavnel / Laviel / Lavni 
Beredo (snow in amharic) or variants like Beredri / Beledri / Berad 

Already decided they were called the Indala Mountains, or Indalas, by the Stonborn. Theoretically this could just be the universal name. 

The dwarves settle these the most densely, so it could be the dwarven name that is universal, maybe something like:
Labkar
Labkhan
Labad
Sheth’abad
Shethrabad
Abadkan

Dunmari
Tushāra
Sveti
Seveti
Svera
Safedi
Safanti
Kavachi

Or could go for something in English:

(on the theme of dividing/guarding/barrier)

Sentinel Range (or the Sentinels)
Great Barrier Range
The Palisades (perhaps too famous in the real world)
The Curtain Range 
Citadel Mountains (or the Citadels)

(on the theme of simple descriptions of tall mountains; could replace Mountains with Range or Peaks in any of these)
White Mountains (not my favorite; too obvious and used in Tolkien + real world)
Snowy Mountains 
Graystorm Mountains
Whitespire Mountains

Here are some from ChatGPT:

**Thundar Peaks**  
_Short form: Thundars or The Thunds_  
Emphasizes the stormy nature of the mountains.

**Frostfang Ridge**  
_Short form: Frostfangs or The Fangs_  
Highlighting the icy, sharp nature of the peaks.

**Stormcrown Crests**  
_Short form: Crowns or The Crests_  
Emphasizing the stormy summits of the mountains.

**Stoneheart Range** _Short form: Stonehearts or The Hearts_  
Represents the central, "heart" role the mountains might play in the continent.

**Titanback Mountains**  
_Short form: Titanbacks or The Titans_  
Evokes a sense of grand scale.

**Skyreach Ridges**  
_Short form: Skyridges or The Reaches_  
Suggests peaks so tall they seem to touch the sky.

**Earthspine Heights**  
_Short form: Earthspines or The Spines_  
Describes the mountain range as the backbone of the continent.

**Stormhold Peaks**  
_Short form: Stormholds or The Holds_  
Represents the stormy nature, but without the icy connotation.

**Sunderpeak Mountains**  
_Short form: Sunderpeaks or The Sunders_  
A name implying that the mountains themselves sundered or split the continent in ages past.

**Stormhaven Heights**  
_Short form: Stormhavens or The Havens_  
Suggesting the mountains are a haven for storms, emphasizing both the dangerous and snow-covered aspects.

**Stonecliff Divide**  
_Short form: Stonecliffs or The Cliffs_  
A rugged, imposing range much like the Rockies.

**Skyplume Peaks**  
_Short form: Skyplumes or The Plumes_  
Evoking the towering height and misty, cloud-covered summits.

**Ridgehorn Mountains**  
_Short form: Ridgehorns or The Horns_  
Evoking the jagged, horn-like peaks typical of alpine regions.

**Cloudcap Crests**  
_Short form: Cloudcaps or The Caps_

**Whitecrown Mountains**  
_Short form: Whitecrowns or The Crowns_

**Blackstone Divide**  
_Short form: Blackstones or The Stones_

Suggesting the mountains act as sentinels or protectors.

Ultimately probably makes sense that these prominent mountains would have many names, but probably want a primary English name for reference, with alternative dwarven, stoneborn, and perhaps deno'qai or dunmari alternatives
