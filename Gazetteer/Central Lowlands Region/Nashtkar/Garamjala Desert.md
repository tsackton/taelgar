A vast sandy desert south and east of [[Karawa]], formed in the aftermath of the [[Great War]] by the rain shadow cast by the newly rising [[Yuvanti Mountains]]. 

%%notes
Vast desert in east and south of the settled parts of Dunmar.

Mostly a rocky high plateau, not super sandy, except in isolated places. Reminiscent of high deserts of Chile in real world in places, although not quite so extreme.

Does get occasional rain during the monsoon season.

Little makes its home here, but occasional ogres, giant vultures, and giant scorpions are the main "top predators".
