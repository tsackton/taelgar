Uzgukhar is the capitol and primary city of the kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]], home of the [[People of the Rainbow]]. A desert city, nestled between the Kulthul and the Drogar rivers, Uzgukhar consists largely of mud brick buildings decorated with colorful murlals and intricate carvings. Notable landmarks include the palace, a large cattle market, the plaza of freedom, and the hall of the ancestors. 

The palace, located near the center of the city and set on a small hill, has an elaborate public roof garden, with the throne room and apartments underground to provide relief from the heat. 

The hall of ancestors is a large, imposing structure made of sandstone, adorned with intricate carvings depicting both the ancient legends of the origin of the [[People of the Rainbow]], and the founding of [[Xurkhaz]] under the leadership of [[Uzgash]]. 

Outside the hall of ancestors is the Plaza of Freedom, the central public square of Uzgukhar. The plaza of freedom celebrates the refugees who kept the dream of the [[People of the Rainbow]] alive during the dark years when the [[Mantle of Protection|Cloak of Rainbows]] was lost, and also includes a monument to all [[Orcs]] that still suffer under [[Thark]]'s chains.
