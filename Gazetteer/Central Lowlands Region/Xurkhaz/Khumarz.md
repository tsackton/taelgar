Khumarz is a fortified border town that serves as a vital outpost for the kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]]. Situated on the banks of the Kulthul River, it guards the western border of the kingdom against the dangers of the [[Plaguelands]]. The town is enclosed by high walls made of thick stone, with watchtowers strategically placed along the ramparts to provide a clear view of the surrounding wilderness. The gates of Khumarz are guarded by heavily armed [[Orcs]], ever-vigilant against any threat that might arise from the cursed land beyond. The town's buildings are simple and functional, designed for defense and survival rather than aesthetic appeal.
