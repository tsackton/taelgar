# The Central Lowlands Region
>[!info]+ Information
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

This region of Taelgar includes the land south of the [[Sentinel Range]], from the [[Myraeni Gap]] and the Dunmari coast in the west, past the [[Garamjala Desert]] and the [[Nashtkar]] in the east to the unknown lands beyond the wastes. To the south, this region extends to the ruins of [[Drankor]], and beyond to the [[Sea of Storms]].  [[Dunmar]] is the largest extant polity in this region, though this is the former heartland of the vast [[Drankorian Empire]]. 

This region experienced considerable upheaval after the [[Great War]], as the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] rose from the sea, creating the new land of [[Western Dunmar]], and turning the former fertile plains of the interior to desert. 

## Boundaries

## Climate

While historically the climate in this region was very different, in the current day this region is split between [hot arid desert and semi-arid scrub](https://geodiode.com/climate/hot-deserts), in the interior east of the [[Yuvanti Mountains]],  and both [tropical](https://geodiode.com/climate/tropical-monsoon-and-tropical-savannah) and [subtropical](https://geodiode.com/climate/humid-subtropical) humid monsoon climates on the coast, especially in [[Western Dunmar]] between the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] and the [[Nevos Sea]].
