# The Red Lily Inn
>[!info]+ Information
> An [[Halflings|halfling]] inn in [[Tokra]], [[Central Dunmar]], [[Dunmar]]

A halfling inn, also on the west side of town, just inside the walls, near the western gate. Run by [[Wes Strongbones]] and his twin sons Tye and Cade. 

A cozy, comfortable place, with about 10 halfing sized rooms and another 20 human sized ones, plus a bunk room and stables, and a renowned kitchen. Mostly a merchant / out of town crowd, though.
