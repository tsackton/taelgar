# The Red Mesa
>[!info]+ Information
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

The Red Mesa is a large, flat topped mesa of red stone, that rises six hundred feet or more above desert, marked by ochre rock formations that seem almost to pulse with inner life. 

According to the [[Shakun mystai]], the mesa has been at this location since the early days of [[Dunmar]]. They claim that the mesa is the physical representation of [[Shakun]] herself, the mark of her presence on Taelgar.

%% these notes were learned by party in Dunmar campaign, but aren't common knowledge, not sure how to represent this in Taelgarverse%%
The mesa itself is alive, as long as the [[Heart of Shakun]] remains within it, at the sacred site in the center of the Temple of Shakun. The rock grows, and the Shakun mystai harvest the living rock to produce healing powders and ointments. The living energy of the mesa, again in combination with the Heart of Shakun, also provides the mystical energy that allows [[Shakun's Protection]] to exist.
