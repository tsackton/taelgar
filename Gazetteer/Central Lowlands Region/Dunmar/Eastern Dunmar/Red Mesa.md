# The Red Mesa
>[!info]+ Information
> A mesa in [[Eastern Dunmar]], [[Dunmar]], the [[Central Lowlands Region]]

A large, flat topped mesa of red stone, and the most notable landmark of [[Karawa]], rising six hundred feet or more above the town and the oasis it is built around.

The mesa itself is quite old, dating almost to [[The Founding of Dunmar]], for it represents the goddess [[Shakun]], and is in some sense her representation on earth.

There has always been a holy spring here, a place that people said could show you glimpses of dreams and faraway visions of possible futures, guarded and protected by a small Mystery Cult dedicated to [[Shakun]].
