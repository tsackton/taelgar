# Stormcaller Tower
>[!info]+ Information
> A tower in the [[Eastern Dunmar]], [[Dunmar]]

Eons ago, lost in the dawn of time when the Firstborn walked the earth and the great empires of giants and dragons and other creatures of myth and legendÂ  stretched across the world, great skyships of the storm giants sailed the skies, powered by [[Phasing Stones]] that could remake reality around them. While a few may remain in distant hidden corners of the world, or travel the skies of other planes, many crashed or were destroyed.

One such skyship, the Star on the Wind, known as Vindristjarna (vin-dree-shar-na) to the storm giants, crashed on what is now the Dunmari plains thousands of years ago. 

Stormcaller Tower was originally constructed on the prow of this crashed ship by the [[Elves|elves]], before [[The Downfall]], during the height of power of the ancient elven kingdom of [[Alcarinque]]. 

The world turned, and the elves retreated, and humans spread across the land. The Drankorians soon found the tower, and studied the ancient magics within. Towards the end of the [[Drankorian Empire]], the tower became the base and outpost of [[Eudomes]] Stormcaller, a powerful Drankorian mage. He devised an elaborate magical mechanism to bind and trap storms themselves, harnessing their energy for magical works, and ultimately hoping to restore the skyship below somehow. 

A few years before the fall of [[Drankor]], his nets caught [[Hralgar]] Skaldjotendur, an elder storm giant, who was passing in the form of a wild thunderstorm. When the plague struck, [[Eudomes]] fled, or died, but [[Hralgar]] could not completely free himself, and the tower was abandoned.

For many centuries, there [[Hralgar]] remained, trapped. With the fall of [[Drankor]], knowledge the Stormcaller Tower was lost. The Dunmari knew it as a landmark, and also a place to be avoided, a place of strange magic and wild weather. To them, this place was called Pavantova, the Tower of Wild Wind.

In the spring of 1748, three Chardonian treasure hunters entered the tower and made their way to the top floor, where they found the mechanism of [[Eudomes]], and attempted to recover it for the [[Great Library]]. There efforts were only partially successful: they released [[Hralgar]], but not completely. He was awoken without fully returning to consciousness and control, and was lost in a dream state, lashing out and creating a powerful, endless storm. 

In November 1748, [[The Dunmar Fellowship]] returned to the tower and completed the process of freeing [[Hralgar]], ending the storm. 

The tower was destroyed in 1748 by [[Hralgar]] after he was freed, in retribution.
