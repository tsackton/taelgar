%% a fair bit of discussion in discord, but not sure how much of it is (a) relevant, (b) not already captured in [[A Synthesis of Humanity in Greater Sembara]] or [[Languages]] %%

%% some details to flesh out:
- with the rework of the Zimkova and the peopling of this region, this needs to be updated to better reflect the cultural connections and divisions, e.g. [[A Synthesis of Humanity in Greater Sembara]]
- some details of the wall, primarily a name, need to be filled in from Vimfrost's War, along with details of the history with Sembara / Derik III

Vostok, the "homeland of the Vos," is a land of many rivers, bitter winters, and few people, generally defined as the land northeast of the [[Volta]] river and southwest of the [[Svinjo Mountains]], between the [[Green Sea]] and the cold dry plains of the kenku in the northwest. 

Most of the population lives in the southern part of Vostok, called Voslaag ("home of the lowlanders"; often called South Vostok or South Vosland in [[Sembara]]), within a hundred miles of the coast, and along the lower [[Kem]] river valley. This is a region of few cities, few roads, and difficult travel, with lots of uninhabited land even within the most organized territories of major clans and chiefs. Boats, both on the rivers and the coastal [[Green Sea]], are crucial to trade, travel, and communication throughout Voslaag. 

[[Cymea]] and [[Tollen]], with their strong naval traditions, have often looked to Voslaag for tribute and resources, whether extracted by violence or as part of recognition of an outside overlord. But these relationships - beyond some annual tribute (oftentimes labor, such as sailors for the navy) and a perhaps a personal relationship between a Vos and Cymean or [[Tollen]] leader - have left little impact on the internal culture and politics of Vostok. 

Few people live in the forests and hills of the northern plateaus, the region called Voskald ("homeland of the people of the cold"; often referred to as North Vostok or North Vosland in Sembara). Much more than the people of Voslaag, the Voskalders are closely connected by culture and shared history with the [[Zimkova]], especially the traditionalists in the north.  

Far to the north, the border of Vostok is demarcated with a massive and ancient wall. Stretching 400 miles from the [[Sentinel Range]] to the [[Svinjo Mountains]], this wall is no longer maintained or defended by the people of Vostok or anyway else. It was built in some distant mythical past, so long ago that none now remember its purpose, except perhaps among the elves. Yet, due to the skill and magic woven into its construction, it still stands nearly as strong as ever today.

%% NOTES
Key political organization around a set of chieftains of clans who control a central territory and some of the hinterlands - but some areas are overlapped between multiple chieftains and it isn’t a land of clear regional boundaries. The idea is not really borders, a set of related clans/tribes/chieftains/kingdoms whatever with overlapping circles of influence. 
Inspiration:
- [Middle African Hausa Kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_Kingdoms) 
- [Mandala political model of south east Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala_(political_model))

The names might need an edit - Voslaag and Voskald are more like names of people than places, maybe? at least based on the made up meanings

Two different name variants have been proposed:

- Voslaag (from “lowlander” in Vos; called South [[Vostok|Vosland]] or South [[Vostok]] in Sembara)    
- Voskald (from “people of the cold” in Vos; called North [[Vostok|Vosland]] or North [[Vostok]] in Sembara)

More notes from GDrive, could be old
#### South Vostok

- The southern part of Vostok, basically the hundred miles closest to the coast as well as a narrow band around the Kem (more eastern river) stretching somewhat north of where the Niva joins it, and also somewhat along the Niva
    
- Key political organization around a set of chieftains of clans who control a central territory and some of the hinterlands - but some areas are overlapped between multiple chieftains and it isn’t a land of clear regional boundaries (inspired by the Mandala political model of south east asia -- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala_(political_model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala_(political_model)) ). The idea is not really borders, a set of related clans/tribes/chieftains/kingdoms whatever with overlapping circles of influence
    
- Name: refered to as South Vostok or South Vosland in Sembara
    
- Minimal roads - some rough roads along the coast but communication can be slow except by sea / river. 
    
- Lots of uninhabited land, even within the more organized territories around each of the major tribes/clans/chiefs
    
- I was also looking at the middle African Hausa Kingdoms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausa_Kingdoms)  for inspiration
    
- Some of the larger tribes might recognize Cymea as a overlord type, but little meaning to that outside of perhaps some annual tribute (sailors for the navy?) and a personal relationship between the chief and the Cymean leader (common pattern in south asia vis-a-vie China) 

#### North Vostok

- Very few people
    
- Culturally connected to the Zimkova more than anywhere else, but long sundered, and not a lot of people go back and forth through the lakes region
    
- Lakes region probably mostly uninhabited or entirely uninhabited -- the people of North Vostok are mostly clustered around the big lake in the center of Vostok and the eastern slopes of the central volcanic mountains
    
- Some ancient connection to the folks who built the big wall in the north
