Cymea is a realm of coastal city‑states and river towns spread across the [[Cymean Peninsula]] on the [[Western Green Sea]]. Once a prominent Drankorian province, noted for the martime skill of its sailors, Cymea today is a loose tapestry of independent polities that trade, rival, and occasionally ally with one another. Nonetheless, Cymea still largely looks to the sea: harbors line the peninsula’s shores, and most of the prominent Cymea cities are ports.

Meta/DM notes and campaign interactions:
- Realm framing consolidated from vault references (Geography overviews; external notes on South Cymea); see interior site entries [[Edge of Echoes]] and [[Elemental Forge]].
- Style guidance: treat Cymea as city‑state mosaic with Drankorian heritage; avoid fixing a single capital pending further canon.


Culture and governance vary by city. Some polities preserve oligarchic councils with ancient titles; others have merchant assemblies or strong magistracies. In most, shipyards, dye‑works, and craft guilds underpin the economy; inland, orchards and farms support the markets. Cymeans are accomplished sailors, and their pilots are respected along routes between [[Tollen]], [[Skaerhem|the Skaer Islands]], and the eastern coasts.

The peninsula holds deep historical strata: Drankorian ruins appear in hills and uplands, and several sites of learned interest dot the interior, such as the [[Edge of Echoes]] on the [[Freccilia]] River, where planar thinness once supported experimental forges. While no single city presently dominates all others, regional powers sometimes claim grand titles in emulation of older empires.

Cymea’s relationships with neighbors reflect its maritime outlook. Trade with the Western Gulf is steady if occasionally prideful in tone; Cymean captains range east as far as those willing to brave the capricious currents of the [[Eastern Green Sea]]. To the north, stories of Ursk’s hard frontiers receive a mixture of curiosity and caution in Cymean wine‑shops.

%% Notes from GDrive may be obsolete

- A collection of city states, not fully united, but with a dominant one, probably somewhere in the south-east (perhaps near the more southerly river in the main part of the penisula), or perhaps even on the big island
    
- Inspired by Drankor -- would it make sense to have a leader styling themselves the Emperor of Cymea, in the same vein that a lot of historical figures styled themselves Roman Emperors long after Rome was gone (Byzantium parallel somewhere maybe?)
    
- Clear division between Western Cymea (see below) and the main eastern and southern lands
    
- Some significant influence towards Vostok and a major player on the wider Green Sea
    
- Maybe sees themselves as a bit ‘above’ the Western Gulf and Sembara and trades with them, but sees Sembara as an upstart (whereas Sembara probably sees Cymeans as fooling themselves and pretending to grandier they don’t have, but also, Sembara is more inward focused and is happy enough as long as folks buy their wheat -- the passion would be more to the west and south)

Lots of discussions in email and Discord that could be pulled in here; nothing definitive
