# Western Cymea

Western Cymea is a frontier these days, a place of small strongholds, fortified market towns, and ancient ruins recalling a richer past. This part of the world is a land of rushing, rocky rivers between the [[Plataca Hills]] and the Western Gulf, of mild winters and warm summers, of cattle and wine. Historically, it was a place where piracy and banditry thrived, but over the past few generations, a series of campaigns by the powerful Tollender navy stamped out the worst of the piracy. Now, western Cymea is functionally a protectorate of Tollen, sending aimless youth to work the Tollender ships that ply the [[Green Sea]].

%%% Notes from GDrive, may be obsolete

- Scattered small fishing villages and isolated farmsteads in the hills -- limited political organization
    
- Haven for pirates during the Blood Years, cleaned up by Tollen during Cece’s reign (perhaps with overt or implicit support of Sembara)
    
- Perhaps now there is a Tollen military governor of some kind? Or Tollen is encouraging settlement there?
    
- Could have a heavy Tollen naval presence
