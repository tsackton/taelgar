The Western Gulf is the inland sea at the far western edge of the [[Green Sea]] Separated from [[Green Sea]] proper by the narrow [[Straits of Cymea]], the Western Gulf tends to milder weather and easier navigation. 

In the 1700s, the Western Gulf has been controlled largely by the [[Tollen]] Navy, which extensively patrols and interdicts pirates, keeping shipping lanes safe. 

While most of the Western Gulf is a relatively shallow sea, several deep canyons may hold unusual mysteries in the depths.
