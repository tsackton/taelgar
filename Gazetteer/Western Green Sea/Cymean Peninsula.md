# The Cymean Peninsula

The Cymean Peninsula is a large stretch of coast and uplands on the [[Western Green Sea]]. It helps shelter the [[Western Gulf]] and is separated from the wider Green Sea by the narrow [[Straits of Cymea]].

Long a Drankorian province, the peninsula is now better known for the city‑states and river towns collectively called [[Cymea]]. Halfling sailors speak of Cymea as a place of old stone, proud harbors, and rival polities, where Drankorian inheritance still shapes law and culture even as modern powers rise and fall.

The peninsula is divided by the [[Plataca Hills]]; to the south, the uplands give way toward the ill-defined barrier of the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]].
