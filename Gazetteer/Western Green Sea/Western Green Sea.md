*Area:* This region includes [[Sembara]], [[Tollen]], [[Tyrwingha]], [[Addermarch]], [[Cymea]], [[Vostok]], [[Orenlas]], and [[Skaerhem]].

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The culture and history are well developed as far back as the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. [[Zimkova]], [[Vostok]], and [[Cymea]] are considerably less well developed than the remainder of the region, although large scale events that impact the rest of [[Greater Sembara]] have largely been developed. The [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] was well developed up to the 1680s. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* The exact details after the 1680s of the southern part of this region, particularly the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]], is roughly sketched but not developed canonically in detail. Some open questions remain about history, and some details are only lightly sketched or not completely canonical. [[Vostok]], [[Cymea]] especially outside of [[Western Cymea]], and [[Zimkova]] are generally not developed in detail, although canonical loose vibes exist for [[Cymea]] and [[Zimkova]], at least. 

*Blank Regions:* The only thing that approaches a blank slate here is [[Vostok]] (and perhaps [[Cymea]] and/or [[Zimkova]]), which has numerous brainstorming but minimal canonical detail. The [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] are largely undeveloped from a geographic point of view, although the [[Skaerhem|Skaer]] are fairly well developed in culture, politics, religion, and history. Any development in this region needs to consider a significant amount of canonical history, geography, and culture. The [[Grastenvakt|Grastenvakt]], the wall across the north of Vostok, is intentionally left blank. 

*Adventures:* The [[Cleenseau Campaign]] and the Addermarch campaign are entirely set within this region, in southern Sembara and Addermarch respectively. The Dunmar Frontier campaign spent significant time in Tollen, and visited ruins in Cymea, Orenlas, and the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]]. 

*Area:* This area includes the western half of the Green Sea itself, including the islands in this area, most notably [[Irrla]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* IThe pirate ship [[Flaming Tempest]] visited the unnamed island off the coast of Cymea, but the details of why are not canonically determined. 


*Non-Canonical Development:* The Republic of Svolhas is probably mariner, but nothing about them, including religion is particularly determined, other than a recent (1740s) war with the hobgoblins provoking a naval bulidup. Some notes about patterns of wind and currents exist, but are not strictly canonical. The pirate ship [[Flaming Tempest]] visited the unnamed island off the coast of Cymea, but the details of why are not canonically determined. 

*Blank Regions:* This region has significant brainstorming, but outside the details above is entirely a blank slate. 

*Adventures:* The Wellby solo arc, and the unplayed but canonical adventures of the Vindristjarna crew while the Dunmar Fellowship was in Ursk, both involved hobgoblin raiders from Irrla, but no adventures have actually be set in this region.
