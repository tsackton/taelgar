Antaka is a small island dominated by a massive volcano. There are four small villages here, which together make a single district of only 6 oskunja. 

Three of the villages are nestled by the ocean near small harbors, and are largely fishing villages. The fourth village, the largest, sits below the caldera of the crater, a few hours walk from a holy site and temple to [[Kaikkea]] associated with the volcano. [[Skalme]] is the priest here.
