%% [[Iskra]] home island %%

Pikkua is a small island community in [[Skaerhem|the Skaer Islands]] of the [[Western Green Sea]]. Isolated and self‑reliant, it is organized around several oskunja—work‑kin groups that manage fleets, nets, and shared holdings. Life on Pikkua follows the sea’s rhythm: fishing seasons, weather windows, and the constant maintenance of boats and gear.

Religious life centers on devotion to [[Kaikkea]], whose speakers (hakeasa) guide the island’s rites and offer counsel to households. Temples are modest; shrines and wind‑bells mark cliff paths and harbor heads, a reminder to the sea and sky that Pikkua keeps faith. Outsiders are rare and generally treated with courtesy so long as they respect custom and keep to the guest‑landing.

Pikkua’s people travel widely despite the island’s small size—young sailors crew on trading routes between Cymea, Tollen, and the Skaer archipelago, carrying news, songs, and the island’s understated pride to far piers.

Meta/DM notes and campaign interactions:
- Background: See [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Collected Stories/Iskra's Story|Iskra’s Story]] for an exemplar of Pikkua upbringing (oskunja, hakeasa, devotion to Kaikkea).
- Practical: treat Pikkua as a modest, pious fishing community; use oskunja as social units; guest‑landing custom for visitors.
