Skaerhem, called Skaegenland by the Sembarans, is a collection of islands (the Skaer Islands), many volcanic, and the nearby coastline in the northwestern corner of the [[Green Sea]]. This is a land of frequent storms, rocky land, and difficult seas, but also a region teaming with marine bounty, and rich in rare volcanic metals and precious stones.
