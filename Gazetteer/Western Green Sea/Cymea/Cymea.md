%% Notes from GDrive may be obsolete

- A collection of city states, not fully united, but with a dominant one, probably somewhere in the south-east (perhaps near the more southerly river in the main part of the penisula), or perhaps even on the big island
    
- Inspired by Drankor -- would it make sense to have a leader styling themselves the Emperor of Cymea, in the same vein that a lot of historical figures styled themselves Roman Emperors long after Rome was gone (Byzantium parallel somewhere maybe?)
    
- Clear division between Western Cymea (see below) and the main eastern and southern lands
    
- Some significant influence towards Vostok and a major player on the wider Green Sea
    
- Maybe sees themselves as a bit ‘above’ the Western Gulf and Sembara and trades with them, but sees Sembara as an upstart (whereas Sembara probably sees Cymeans as fooling themselves and pretending to grandier they don’t have, but also, Sembara is more inward focused and is happy enough as long as folks buy their wheat -- the passion would be more to the west and south)
