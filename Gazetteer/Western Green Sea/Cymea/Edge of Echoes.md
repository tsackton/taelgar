The Edge of Echoes is a cave complex on the [[Freccilia|Freccilia River]] in the interior of the [[Cymean Peninsula]]. Known to rivermen and old Cymean pilots, the site has a reputation for strange reflections and half‑heard voices—signs of a place where this world lies thin against others. The caves shelter Drankorian‑era works, including the [[Elemental Forge]], and have long been avoided except by the curious and the bold.

Scholars of planar phenomena identify the Edge as an [[Cosmology/Planar Concepts/Extraplanar Weak Point|extraplanar weak point]], a location where energies from beyond the Material seep into the world. In Drankorian times, an entity of elemental air—[[Sh’shethis]]—was bound within the Forge, apparently to maintain or exploit that permeability. In recent years, the bindings were broken and the bound power released, and the caves have grown quieter by report, though the place retains its reputation for thin veils and lingering echoes.

The river approach requires careful navigation: the Freccilia runs swift through rocky bends near the caves, and in high water the lower passages flood. The upper galleries, reached by ancient stairs, open into worked chambers where alchemists and artificers once labored. Some of those rooms still hold durable relics of Drankorian make.

While rumors sometimes cast the Edge as “haunted,” learned accounts attribute the phenomena to planar bleed—whisper‑echoes, reflections that move a moment too late, a chill that tastes of winds from other skies. The cautious keep a respectful distance; the wise bring offerings and a sure guide.
