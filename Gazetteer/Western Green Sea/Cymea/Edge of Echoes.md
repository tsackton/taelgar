# The Edge of Echoes

The Edge of Echoes is a cave complex on the [[Freccilia|Freccilia River]] in the interior of the [[Cymean Peninsula]]. The site has a reputation for strange reflections and half‑heard voices, often in the form of distance half-felt breezes and whispers on the wind. While rumors sometimes cast the Edge of Echoes as “haunted,” learned scholars attribute the phenomena to planar bleed: whisper‑echoes on strange breezes and a chill that tastes of winds from other skies.

The river approach requires careful navigation: the Freccilia runs swift through rocky bends near the caves, and plunges underground prior to reaching the cave entrance. The upper galleries, reached by ancient stairs, open into worked chambers where alchemists and artificers once labored. Deeper within, the caves shelter Drankorian‑era works, including the [[Elemental Forge]], and have long been avoided except by the most adventurous of travelers.

Scholars of planar phenomena identify the Edge as an [[Cosmology/Planar Concepts/Extraplanar Weak Point|extraplanar weak point]], a location where energies from beyond the Material seep into the world. In Drankorian times, an entity of elemental air—[[Sh’shethis]]—was bound within the Forge, apparently to maintain or exploit that permeability. In recent years, the bindings were broken and the bound power released, and the caves have grown quieter by report, though the place retains its reputation for thin veils and lingering echoes.
