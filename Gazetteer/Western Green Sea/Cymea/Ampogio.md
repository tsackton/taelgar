The longest river in Cymea, flowing from the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]], along the western edge of the rocky interior, until it reaches the [[Western Green Sea]]. The upper reaches for the Ampogio are unnavigable, marked by frequent waterfalls as it cascades through the karst landscapes of interior Cymea. Below the confluence with the [[~Unnamed East Fork~]], the Ampogio slows and widens until it drains into the [[Western Green Sea]].
