The Elemental Forge is a Drankorian‑era workshop and laboratory within the [[Edge of Echoes]] cave complex on the [[Freccilia|Freccilia River]]. The site was constructed to harness planar energies where the boundary between worlds is thin. An entity of elemental air—[[Sh’shethis]]—was bound here for centuries, its presence sustaining an [[Cosmology/Planar Concepts/Extraplanar Weak Point|extraplanar weak point]] that infused the chambers with ambient power.

Across several galleries lie well‑preserved workrooms associated with the [[Occulta Ludum]], including alchemical benches, warding circles, and jeweler’s tools. Durable artifacts of practical make—an ever‑cold chest for preserving perishables, a silver pitcher that purifies liquids—attest to the Forge’s blend of utility and theory. Workshops show unfinished projects and stock gemstones awaiting the artisan’s hand, abandoned when the facility fell silent.

At the heart of the complex stood the binding apparatus that held Sh’shethis. In recent years the binding failed (or was deliberately broken), releasing the entity and altering the energetic character of the Forge. While the galleries remain suffused with lingering magic, the constant elemental pulsing has faded; explorers now report steadier conditions and fewer spontaneous manifestations.

The Forge’s reputation among riverfolk wavers between awe and caution: it is a place where careful craft and planar study once intertwined, and where echoes of that work can still be felt in the dust of the benches and the still‑working devices left behind.
