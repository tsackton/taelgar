# The Elemental Forge

The Elemental Forge is a Drankorian‑era workshop and laboratory within the [[Edge of Echoes]] cave complex on the [[Freccilia|Freccilia River]]. The site was constructed to harness planar energies for magical purposes. An entity of elemental air—[[Sh’shethis]]—was bound here for centuries, its presence sustaining an [[Cosmology/Planar Concepts/Extraplanar Weak Point|extraplanar weak point]] that infused the chambers with ambient power. Across several galleries lie well‑preserved workrooms associated with the [[Occulta Ludum]], including alchemical benches, warding circles, and jeweler’s tools. 

At the heart of the complex stood the binding apparatus that held [[Sh’shethis]]. In recent years the binding failed (or was deliberately broken), releasing the entity and altering the energetic character of the Forge, such that it no longer anchors extraplanar energies for magical creation. But whether more mysteries remain to be found is not known.
