# The Tokra-Darba Road

A Dunmari road that runs from the [[~Crossroads Caravanserai~]], west of [[Tokra]], through the [[Copper Hills]], until it joins the [[~Darba-Songara Road~]] northeast of [[Darba]]. This road has seen better days: it is dusty and dry in the summer, and muddy during the monsoon. Nonetheless, for much of its length there are maintained way stations, and well-stocked caravanserai, spaced a day's journey apart. The only truly rough spot is the 60 miles or so where the road passes through the rocky outcroppings of the [[Copper Hills]], where there are no inns or waystations.
