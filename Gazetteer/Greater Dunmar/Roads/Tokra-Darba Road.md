# The Tokra-Darba Road

A Dunmari road that runs from the [[~Crossroads Caravanserai~]], northwest of [[Tokra]], through the [[Copper Hills]], until it joins the [[~Darba-Songara Road~]] northeast of [[Darba]]. This road has seen better days: it is dusty and dry in the summer, and muddy during the monsoon. Nonetheless, for much of its length there are maintained way stations, and well-stocked caravanserai, spaced a day's journey apart. The only truly rough spot is the 60 miles or so where the road passes through the rocky outcroppings of the [[Copper Hills]], where there are no inns or way stations. 

%% notes from onenote: 
The Darba Road is really more of a marked track in the plains, and it is muddy and difficult at the moment, with the rains. It is not paved or anything, and frequently suffers from poor maintenance. 

The road is a minor road, dating from the Dharajun dynasty, pre-Great-War. It gets dusty in the hot summer and muddy in the monsoon.
