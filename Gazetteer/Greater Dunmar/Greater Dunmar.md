%% Edit with changing definitions %%
This region of Taelgar includes the land south of the [[Sentinel Range]], from the [[Myraeni Gap]] and the Dunmari coast in the west, past the [[Garamjala Desert]] and the [[Nashtkar]] in the east to the unknown lands beyond the wastes. To the south, this region extends to the ruins of [[Drankor]], and beyond to the [[Sea of Storms]]. 

This region experienced considerable upheaval after the [[Great War]], as the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] rose from the sea, creating the new land of [[Western Dunmar]], and turning the former fertile plains of the interior to desert.

## Topography and Major Features
_See more: {links}_

The Central Lowlands region is dominated by four major topographical features. 
- The [[Dunmari Basin]] lies south of the Sentinels. This is a broad, flat plain, semi-arid, but with regular summer monsoons that bring rain and support expansive grassland. 
	- To the northwest, the [[Dunmari Basin]] is separated from the Yeraad watershed by the Myraeni Gap, a line of rugged hills between the Sentinels and the [[Chataan Mountains]]. 
	- To the west, the [[Dunmari Basin]] is separated from the Nevos Sea by the [[Darba Highlands]] extending from the [[Copper Hills]], and the Yuvanti Mountains
	- To the north, the Sentinels form the edge of the basin; in the spring, snowmelt-fed streams and rivers bring life to the northern plains. 
	- To the east, the Garamjala Plateau, a high desert, separates the [[Dunmari Basin]] from the Istaros watershed. 
	- The only outflow from the [[Dunmari Basin]] is the ~Hara Gorge~, southeast of Askandi, that cuts through the rocky deserts on the western edge of the Garamjala Plateau. 
- The Yuvanti Mountains separate the [[Dunmari Basin]] from the Nevos Sea. Higher and more rugged in the south, the rain shadow of the Yuvanti Moutains creates the vast Garamjala Desert. 
	- At the northern edge of the Yuvanti Moutains, a series of hills and river valleys known as the Darba Highlands connects the Yuvanti to the [[Chataan Mountains]], and isolates the [[Dunmari Basin]] from the Nevos. 
	- West of the Yuvanti, the broad, flat Nayan Floodplains stretch to the sea. 
- The Garamjala Plateau is an extremely arid mid-elevation plateau, that rises between the Hara and the Mahar watersheds. This area is almost entirely inhospitable desert.
- East and north of the Garamjala Plateau, the Istaros watershed runs from the foothills of the Sentinels near Sembara, through the Plaguelands, south into the Desolation of Cha'mutte and the fabled city of Drankor.

## Climate

While historically the climate in this region was very different, in the current day this region is split between [hot arid desert and semi-arid scrub](https://geodiode.com/climate/hot-deserts), in the interior east of the [[Yuvanti Mountains]],  and both [tropical](https://geodiode.com/climate/tropical-monsoon-and-tropical-savannah) and [subtropical](https://geodiode.com/climate/humid-subtropical) humid monsoon climates on the coast, especially in [[Western Dunmar]] between the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] and the [[Nevos Sea]].

## 5. Dunmari Basin

*Area:* This region includes the [[Dunmari Basin]], the [[Myraeni Gap]], and the [[Garamjala Desert]] (including the orc kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]]), as well as the ancient city of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the [[Sea of Storms]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The current day climate and geography of this entire region, and the history dated back to before the Downfall, is extensively developed, although much of the history before the Great War is developed only in broad strokes. The history, religion, and politics of Dunmar and Xurkhaz are extensively developed. The desolation around Drankor (including the ruined city itself), the wastes of the Garamjala, and the [[Awakened Jungle]] have significant, but not exhaustive, development. Any future development in this region needs to be aware of significant constraints imposed by existing development. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Much of the history of the Drankorian Empire is only broadly sketched, especially in the core of the Empire represented by this region. The pre-Downfall history of [[Alcarinque]] is only very lightly developed. The [[Nayan Floodplains]] have much less development than the rest of [[Dunmar]], especially about current-day political and cultural details. The [[Yuvanti Mountains]], although canonically the home of the [[Nardith]], has very little detailed development. The region around the [[Shrev]] and south is only lightly sketched, as is the [[Myraeni Gap]]. 

*Blank Regions:* The desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries, but need to be developed with canonical details in mind. The exact impact of the Downfall Wars on [[Alcarinque]], and the fall of the elven empires, is explicitly left blank, to be explored in a potential future Downfall Wars campaign. The [[Nayan Floodplains]] and the [[Yuvanti Mountains]]/[[Nardith]] could use more detailed development, and the area south of the [[Shrev]] as well as the [[Myraeni Gap]] are both potentially open for development, contingent on some details of [[Dunmar#History|Dunmari history]].

*Adventures:* The Dunmar Frontier campaign has involved numerous adventures in this region, including [[Central Dunmar]], [[Darba]] and the [[Darba Highlands]], [[Eastern Dunmar]], [[Tokra]], [[Karawa]], the [[Nashtkar]] and other regions east of Karawa, including [[Kharsan]], [[Xurkhaz]], the [[Awakened Jungle]], and [[Drankor]]. The [[Oskar and Riswynn Adventures]] were largely set in [[Nardith]] and nearby regions, but did not involve much worldbuilding.
