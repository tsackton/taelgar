Ragath Dor, often called High Door or the Highdoor Pass in the Common tongue, is the principal mountain route across the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], and forms the practical southern border of the dwarven kingdom of [[Nardith]]. While the crossing is steep and narrow in places, and often subject to sudden storms, especially during the monsoon season, it is the only place where horses can reliably cross the mountains south of the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]]. The Dunmari maintain way stations along the route from [[Nayahar]] to [[Askandi]] that crosses this pass.
