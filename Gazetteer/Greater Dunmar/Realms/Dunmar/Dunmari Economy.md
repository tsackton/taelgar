    
- In the west, fertile land means that crop agriculture is becoming more important for the economy
    
- Historically, the economy was supported in part by trade, both as caravans/guards/merchants but also running a high speed message service that could move information very quickly across Dunmar on fast horses. But now, this is a minor part of the economy.
    

- What is left of this trade economy mostly involves the Dwarf/Chardon trade, which passes through western Dunmar to the coast, or through central Dunmar to Songara. 
    
- The message system is largely extinct now, but fast messages still run from Askandi -~ Tokra -~ Songara, and Nayahar -~ Darba -~ Tokra; the latter is more efficient as it still has full official support and stocked waystations
    
- Trade that comes from the east usually runs via halfling caravans out of Sembara, who trade for Dunmari goods to bring on to Chardon
    
- Songara is a major horse trading center
    

- Timber is becoming an important product of the far south, south of the Shrev, and the trade in tropical hardwoods north to Chardon is a major source of wealth in the current dynasty
    
- A lot of food, especially water-intensive crops, is imported from Chardon, although less so as agricultural develops in the west, and the traditional Dunmari diet is almost all forage and animal products, with a lot of yogurt and cheese and such, plus meat’


#### Coins

Coins are not commonly used in the current day in Eastern Dunmar, as much trade is conducted in barter and in kind. 

The king in Nayahar mints coins, however, and these are in occasional use in the east.

Gold coins (worth 1 gp) are known as steeds; silver coins as rupas, and copper coins as taams.

Older coins from pre-Blood Years uses the same names, but tended to be larger and more pure, and so can trade for more than their 'face value'

Steeds = 2 gp
Rupas = 4 sp

Taams = 1 cp

(may change these values; 1 steed = 5 rupas = 400 taams, so 1 rupa = 80 taams)
  
Dwarven coins are in common usage in Dunmar as well, especially iron trading coins, known as nibs, that are backed by a gold standard but not otherwise containing any intrinsic worth. Nibs in 5 sp, 1 gp, 10 gp, and 50 gp are known. Dwarven trade bars, stamped with a known weight of silver or gold, are commonly used for large transactions in Dunmar as well.
