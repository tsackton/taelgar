## Temples

Temples dot the Dummari landscape: to be a Dunmari means to be part of a temple, and all Dunmari have a temple they call home, even if they visit quite rarely, perhaps only for the most important festivals. In the more nomadic parts of the country, temples are some of the only permanent structures, often nucleating small villages around them. Large cities, however, may have two or three temples serving them. 

Each temple is run by a head priest. Technically these are chosen by the Samraat, but usually based on the recommendation of the former priest. Depending on the size of the temple, a number of additional priests, acolytes, and laity may serve the community in some role. Each temple also serves as a major administrative center of the state, and usually has at least one and typically many more acolytes and/or priests whose primary responsibility is administrative rather than religious. 
### Temple Conclave


During the Aatmaji Dynasty, traditionally the Speaker of the Lakan Mystai received divine guidance from Laka himself, in the form of dreams and visions, to guide this choice, and the role of the temple conclave was often simply to confirm the choice of the Speaker. 

During the Dharajun Dynasty, often called the Dynasty of the Horse and associated with Chidya, a horse blessed with the spirit of Chidya was the sign of the gods, and pointed the conclave to the next Samraat. 

During the Nayan Dynasty, interpreting the will of the gods has been less clear, and in many cases the Samraat has effectively appointed an heir, which has made the Dunmari monarchy semi-hereditary. 

## Taxes and Obligations

Two major streams of obligation run from the people to the Samraat. 

First, each temple is responsible for a tithe to the Samraat, which must be paid annually and supports the machineries of the state. To pay this tithe, temples rely on tithes made from the community during the major festivals of the year. Generally, a fraction of this revenue is kept for temple upkeep, including potentially the village around the temple, and the rest covers the tithe due the royal treasury. 

Second, each temple district owes service to the gods (in practice, to the Samraat), based on the size of the district. Traditionally military service, this obligation was the basis of the famed armies of the Dunmari, but more recently payment in lieu of service has become common, especially in prosperous urban areas. The amount owed is determined by a census, supposed to be conducted every 20 years, and counts every adult of riding age, so the very young and the very old are excluded. 

Cities and villages have another revenue stream: rents. Technically, all land in Dunmar is owned by the gods. While most land is held in common for pasture, herding, and hunting, land in cities and towns, as well as agricultural land where it can be supported, is leased to individuals. The rents from these leases flow to the temple that controls the land in that region, and is used to fund local needs, for defense, roads, etc. Many towns also impose market taxes or sales taxes, or maintain monopolies on certain goods. 

Traditionally, because the land is the gods, passage across it is free and unencumbered, accounted for in the tithe for common lands. In better days, temples at border crossings would collect tithes from travelers so the gods would keep them safe on their journeys, but many of these have fallen into disrepair and have been abandoned, especially in the east. But in the former days of Dunmar, this was a major source of revenue for the Samraat. 

Formally, everyone who uses the land owes the tithe, and even non-Dunmari living in Dunmar are expected to make donations to the local temple. But service obligations accrue only to Dunmari citizens.

The mystery cults exist outside this system. Mystai, as initiates of these cults are called, are freed from obligation to tithe or service, and the mystery cults themselves do not owe tithe to the Samraat. The mystery cults derive revenue from specific monopolies they are granted, as well as rents on land they control. All mystery cults have specific monopolies on the sale and provision of particular magical goods and services, and many also have rights to particular other monopolies in their area. In regions with both a mystery cult and a temple, the distribution of rents between them can be a tricky political issue, and there are usually founding charters that delineate rents owed. Some mystery cults which are isolated and far from settlements are largely self-sufficient, providing their own food and defense and acquiring occasional additional goods by bartering whatever they produce. 

With these revenues, the Samraat and temples fulfill the promises of the gods to the people: that they will be safe on the land of the Dumari, that they will prosper and thrive. In practice, this means the Samraat is responsible for the defense of the land, improvements to the land such as road building and fortification, the provision of wayhouses and stables for messengers and travelers, and foreign relations.
