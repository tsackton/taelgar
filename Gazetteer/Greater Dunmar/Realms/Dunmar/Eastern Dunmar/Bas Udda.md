Bas Udda was once a town like [[Karawa]], same kind of architecture, if anything perhaps bigger. More agriculture, the oasis here on the southeast side of the mesa is on top of a large aquifer so all the land, about 30 miles, from the town to the mesa is planted usually. Hardy grains, some vegetable crops.

Now, all is burned. The land is blackened for miles, like a massive fire raced through. Little is left standing of the village, either. Only a small number of houses in the central part of the village still have roofs.
