%% some onenote details to copy %%

Shakun's Wellspring is a sacred grove on the southern edge of the [[Red Mesa]], a place of peace and tranquility and a place to commune with [[Shakun]]. Shakun's Wellspring is a hidden grove in the south of the [[Red Mesa]], of old, gnarled trees that seem out of place in the desert. During the day, it is nothing, really, and has no particular power, but at night a clear pool appears in the middle of the trees, that reflects not just stars but other planes as well. Shakun herself is said to appear sometimes.

The pool leads to [[Shakun's Realm]], a demi-plane of the divine controlled by [[Shakun]].
