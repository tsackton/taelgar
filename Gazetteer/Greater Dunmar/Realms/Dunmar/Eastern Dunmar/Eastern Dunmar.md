# Eastern Dunmar
>[!info]+ Information
> A region in [[Dunmar]], the [[Greater Dunmar]]

Eastern Dunmar is marginal land centered on the [[Red Mesa]] and the towns that surround it, principally [[Karawa]] and [[Bas Udda]]. Once, this was the heart of Dunmar, but in the current day, it is a sparsely populated scrubland and desert.

Eastern Dunmar remains a highly significant religious site, however. The [[Shakun Mystai]] are based at the [[Temple of Shakun]] in [[Karawa]], and a number of holy sites significant to [[Shakun]] are here, including [[Shakunâ€™s Wellspring]] and the [[Red Mesa]]. 

The densest settlement in this area, outside the villages of the [[Red Mesa]], is on the northern plains north and west of the [[Gomat|Gomat Oasis]], known as the [[Samtal]]. This region gets more rain than the [[~Karawa Desert~]] and supports nomadic grazing and herding, largely of sheep and goats.
