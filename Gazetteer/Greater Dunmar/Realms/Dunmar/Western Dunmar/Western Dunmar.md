Western Dunmar is a productive agricultural region, occupying the flat lands of the [[Nayan Floodplains]], west of the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] and east of the [[Nevos Sea]]. The densest settlement is in the Nayan river valley, which contains the largest city in the region, [[Nayahar]], which also serves as the administrative center and Samraat court of [[Dunmar]]. 

This is a land of savannas and rice paddies, small villages and semi-nomadic pastoralists, with strongly seasonal rainfall peaking during the summer monsoon, followed by a cool, sometimes foggy winter and a brutally hot, dry season leading up to the monsoon.
