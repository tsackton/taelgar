An abandoned mining village in the [[Copper Hills]]. The village is set in the hills, on a bit of a rise. While most of the town is just ruins, the temple of the [[Five Siblings]], on a larger hill, is still mostly intact, albeit completely looted of any valuables. A short walk from the village is a flooded copper mine shaft.
