Songara is the westernmost city in [[Dunmar]], on the [[Stoneway]] near the [[Myraeni Gap]] and the tradition western boundary of the realm of [[Dunmar]]. 

Songara is located in the productive [[~Songara Plains~]] on the western edge of the [[Dunmari Basin]], on the fertile plains on the north bank of the [[Sone]]. It is a major center of animal husbandry and horse rearing in Dunmar, and historically grew around the ancient horse markets. Relatively untouched by the upheavals after the [[Great War]], Songara is among the oldest extant Dunmari cities. It was a major power center of the [[Dharajun Dynasty]], strongly associated with [[Jita]], the founder of that dynasty. 

Songara's economy is based on trade, but it has seen its wealth and power diminish with the growth of the [[Darba]]-[[Chardon]] oceanic trade. The decline in cross-Dunmar traffic, and the concomitant decline in [[Dunmari Economy#Land Ownership|tithes paid by travelers]] for the favor of the [[Five Siblings|Dunmari gods]], has also had a significant impact on Songara's economy. However, Songara remains the center of the breeding, rearing, and trade of the famous Dunmari horses, with thriving horse markets.
