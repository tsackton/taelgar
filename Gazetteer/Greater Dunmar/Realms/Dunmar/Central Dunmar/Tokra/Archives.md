The Tokra Archives are located in a large square building with a significant tower rising 100 feet above the city, across the [[Dharajun Plaza]] from the [[Temple of Tokra]]. First constructed during the early years of the [[Dharajun dynasty]], the Archives suffered significant damage during the [[Fire War]], and was extensively reconstructed in the the simpler, less ostentatious, more flowing, melancholic, and organic style of post-Great-War [[Dunmari Architecture]]. 

The Archives primarily hold historical records from the [[Dharajun dynasty]], with a focus on military and religious records; they are also the major location of records of the eastern army of [[Dunmar]] during the [[Nayan Dynasty]]. In the Archives is also some contemporary scholarship, largely relating to religious matters and the [[Nayan Dynasty]]; contemporary religious and civil administration records are kept in the smaller archives of the [[Temple of Tokra]]. Smaller holdings in the Archives include books on ancient history, especially [[Drankorian Era|Drankorian history]], and collected records of the [[Great War]] assembled by archivists in the years after [[Mavdyr]]'s invasion and the [[Fire War]].

Access to the archives is restricted. Formally, permission is required from the Head Priest of [[Tokra]], the highest civil authority in the city, but in practice the Chief Archivist manages access to the records stored within.
