The complex comprises narrow stairwells, concealed entries, and chambers carved into older foundations, including antechambers with statuary and ritual spaces marked with sigils associated with the plane of [[Pandemonium]] and the cult’s imagery of the Betrayer or “Empty” Moon. 

This lair was establishing during the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]]'s occupation of [[Tokra]] in DR 1748, and destroyed by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] in the same year.
