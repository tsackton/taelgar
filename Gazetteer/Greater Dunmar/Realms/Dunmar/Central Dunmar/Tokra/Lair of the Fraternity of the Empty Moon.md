# The Lair of the Fraternity of the Empty Moon

A secret lair used by the [[Fraternity of the Empty Moon]] in or near [[Tokra]]. The complex comprises narrow stairwells, concealed entries, and chambers carved into older foundations, including antechambers with statuary and ritual spaces marked with sigils associated with the plane of [[Pandemonium]] and the cult’s imagery of the Betrayer or “Empty” Moon. Records indicate that lairs of this sort were used to recruit, indoctrinate, and coordinate werewolf cells operating across Central and Eastern Dunmar.

The Fraternity’s presence in Tokra has waxed and waned. In DR 1625, during the [[Exile of Fraternity of the Empty Moon]], the cult was driven from the city by Dunmari forces. In later years, activity resumed in waves as leaders sought to exploit local weaknesses and the area’s known extraplanar sensitivities. The Tokran lair’s precise location and plan have varied across eras; surviving accounts agree on secluded approaches, a hidden archive or chest for correspondence, and a ritual hall used for oaths and transformations.

While the cult speaks of drawing strength from the “tides” of the moons and outer realms, to outsiders its practice looks like careful use of urban shadows and political distraction—strikes timed to coincide with refugee movements, festivals, or troop transfers. Tokra’s archives contain references to captured papers describing cell structure, ciphers, and a preference for recruiting among the disaffected rather than the desperate.
