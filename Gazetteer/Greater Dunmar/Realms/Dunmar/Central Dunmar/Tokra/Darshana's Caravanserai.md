Darshana's is a large, two-story complex outside the walls on the west side of [[Tokra]]. Rooms and stables surround a bustling open courtyard that serves as the central gathering place, dining room, and marketplace of the complex. A large stables sits just outside the main building. 

Darshana's is popular with merchants and out-of-towners who don't want to pay the fees to sell in the market squares in town, and a lively morning market happens regularly here. While beyond the market Darshana's does not particularly cater to locals, who are more likely to be found at the tea shops in town, it is a popular gathering place for retired soldiers and adventurers, and stories of exploits and conquests, real or imagined, can often be heard here.
