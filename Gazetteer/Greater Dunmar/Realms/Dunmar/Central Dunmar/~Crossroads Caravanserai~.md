A caravanserai at the crossroads of the [[Stoneway]] and the [[Tokra-Darba Road]]. It is often a busy place with travelers, and a good place to collect information. One of the larger caravanserai between [[Tokra]] and [[Songara]] along the [[Stoneway]], with what amounts to a small village around the caravanserai structure itself. During in the months after the monsoon, when the grass in the surrounding plains is lush, grows to a few hundred people or more, but empties out during the heat of summer.
