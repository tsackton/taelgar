# Coastal Dunmar
>[!info]+ Information

This region encompasses the river valleys and ridges in the northwestern part of [[Dunmar]], between the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]], the [[Chataan Mountains]], and the [[Nayan Floodplains]]. By far the most populous  area of this region is the city of [[Darba]] and the lower [[Rudhan]]. To the northwest of [[Darba]], the coastline grows increasingly rocky, dominated by headlands cut by the occasional estuary, fed by waterfalls cascading down the mountains. To the southeast, the land grows gradually gentler, spreading into the broad, flat [[Nayan Floodplains]]. Iinland, the [[Darba Highlands]] roll in wooded hills and managed forests. Summers bring monsoon rains that swell the rivers; winters are drier, and mild along the sea, but with occasional storms blowing from the [[Nevos Sea]] that keep this region far more wooded than the rest of [[Dunmar]].
