# Coastal Dunmar

%%this is the area around Darba; needs some fleshing out and copying notes from OneNote%%

Coastal Dunmar encompasses the river valleys, ridges, and ports along the Nevos shore, dominated by the city of [[Darba]] and the lower [[Rudhan]]. The coastline here alternates between rocky headlands and broad estuaries; inland, the [[Darba Highlands]] roll in wooded hills and managed forests. Summers bring monsoon rains that swell the rivers and drive the timber trade; winters are drier and mild along the sea.

Darba’s harbor—anchored by an old Drankorian fort—serves as the principal maritime gateway for Dunmar. From here, goods move by ship along the coast and by road inland toward [[Tokra]] and [[Songara]]. Illorian architectural traces linger near the docks, a legacy of past occupations and rebuilding, while newer Dunmari construction rises on terraces above.

Outside the city, river towns and estates are strung along the Rudhan and its tributaries. Lumber, grain, and craftwork flow downriver; imported goods flow up. In unsettled times, watch posts along the trade roads and at ferry crossings tighten passage; in prosperous years, Coastal Dunmar’s markets feel the wealth of the sea.
