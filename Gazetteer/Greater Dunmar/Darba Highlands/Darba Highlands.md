%% marked status/mike for feedback on what else, if anything , is useful to include in these geographic region overview notes. is this enough detail? what other information would you want if your PCs were going here, keeping in mind this is supposed to be just geography and terrain info, not people/politics %%

The Darba Highlands are a warm, monsoonal rocky highlands of isolated forests in sheltered valleys, and broad grasslands and savannas that flood during the monsoon rains. The Darba Highlands are bordered by the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] to the southeast, the [[~Darba Coastal Mountains~]] to the north, the [[Nevos Sea]] to the west, and the [[Dunmari Basin]] to the northeast. Geographically, the Darba Highlands transition to the [[Dunmari Basin]] at the height of land in the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]], between the Yuvanti and the [[~Darba Coastal Mountains~]], but culturally, this region typically stretches as far as the [[Copper Hills]].

The largest and most significant river is the [[Rudhan]], which flows from the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]] to the [[Nevos Sea]], and passes by the city of [[Darba]]. But numerous other small rivers dot the landscape, and many more appear during the monsoon rains.

The Darba Highlands have a strong hydrological gradient, with the area around the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]] arid and rocky, and the terrain getting increasingly wet and lush to the west and south, heading towards the [[Nevos Sea]]. The monsoons have a large impact, as the rains tend to lessen as they pass over the highlands.

In the northwest, the Darba Highlands are a region of coastal mountains, where the constant sea breezes and the impact of the [[~Darba Coastal Mountains~]] results in a more even rainfall pattern across the year. 

To the south, the land becomes increasingly flat beyond the [[~Southern Darba River~]], and the terrain transitions to the broad, open [[Nayan Floodplains]] and the new land created as [[Greater Dunmar]] was reshaped at the end of the [[Great War]].
