## Geography

The Darba Highlands are warm, monsoonal rocky highlands of isolated forests in sheltered valleys, and broad grasslands and savannas that flood during the monsoon rains. The Darba Highlands are bordered by the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] to the southeast, the [[Chataan Mountains]] to the north, the [[Nevos Sea]] to the west, and the [[Dunmari Basin]] to the northeast, stretching 200 miles or more inland, and covering the 170 or so miles between the bordering mountain ranges. 

%% note: total size is about 37,000 square miles, roughly the size of Portugal, or Virginia%%

Geographically, the Darba Highlands transition to the [[Dunmari Basin]] at the height of land in the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]], between the Yuvanti and the [[Chataan Mountains]], but culturally, this region typically stretches as far as the [[Copper Hills]].

The largest and most significant river is the [[Rudhan]], which flows from the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]] to the [[Nevos Sea]], and passes by the city of [[Darba]]. But numerous other small rivers dot the landscape, and many more appear during the monsoon rains.

The Darba Highlands have a strong hydrological gradient, with the area around the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]] arid and rocky, and the terrain getting increasingly wet and lush to the west and south, heading towards the [[Nevos Sea]]. The monsoons have a large impact, as the rains tend to lessen as they pass over the highlands.

In the northwest, the Darba Highlands are a region of coastal mountains, where the constant sea breezes and the impact of the [[Chataan Mountains]] results in a more even rainfall pattern across the year. 

To the south, the land becomes increasingly flat beyond the [[~Southern Darba River~]], and the terrain transitions to the broad, open [[Nayan Floodplains]] and the new land created as [[Greater Dunmar]] was reshaped at the end of the [[Great War]]. 

## Climate and Ecology

The Darba Highlands are a diverse, subtropical ecosystem, among the most ecologically and climatically diverse regions of [[Dunmar]]. The heart of the region, the [[Rudhan]] river valley and its tributaries, that flow from the height of land southwest to the [[Nevos Sea]], is a region of dry winters and wet, monsoonal summers, where pockets of seasonal forests grow, especially along rivers and in sheltered gorges, mixed with rolling hills. These forests tend to dry out in the winters, as the rivers shrink, and burst into life in the monsoon season with the rains. 

To the south, towards the [[Nayan Floodplains]], the terrain is flatter, with a savannah ecosystem, while to the north, towards the [[Chataan Mountains]], the land is rocky foothills, with numerous seasonal waterfalls. 

The forests of the Darba Highlands are home to a diverse array of animals, including numerous birds, water buffalo, bears, and diverse small mammals and monkeys, although only water buffalo are frequently seen on the floodplains. 

%%note: climatology of the northern region near the Darba Coastal Mountains is less developed. the main region draws heavily from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Indochina_subtropical_forests and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakadu_National_Park. This is, by a large margin, the most densely forested region of the settled parts of Dunmar, e.g. not including  the rainforests south of the Shrev. Ecology is subject to extension. %%
