The Yuvanti Gap is a highland saddle at the northern fringe of the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], opening onto the rolling hills and river valleys of the [[Darba Highlands]]. From these upland springs and wet meadows, the headwaters of the [[Rudhan]] gather before turning southwest toward the [[Nevos Sea]].

Travelers speak of the Gap as the easiest practical crossing between the Yuvanti interior and the coastward highlands, though “easy” is a relative term: the track climbs steeply, and in the monsoon season mists and storm squalls sweep over the ridges. In winter, dry winds scour the heights, and water runs low in the meadows.

Historically the Gap has served as a corridor for messengers and small caravans moving between the copper‑bearing hills, Darba’s market towns, and clan ranchlands further east. In times of trouble, the passes can be closed with modest effort; stone outcrops and cut banks provide good ground for watch posts controlling the approach.
