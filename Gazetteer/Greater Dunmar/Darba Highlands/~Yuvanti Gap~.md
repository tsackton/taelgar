%% needs a name or to just decide to keep Yuvanti Gap %%

The Yuvanti Gap is a highland saddle at the northern fringe of the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], opening onto the rolling hills  [[Darba Highlands]]. It is the height of land between the [[Yuvanti Mountains]] and the [[Chataan Mountains]] to the northwest; the source of the headwaters of the [[Rudhan]]; and an important orographic barrier that shapes the passage of the monsoons, creating a rain shadow that keeps the interior of central Dunmar and eastern Dunmar drier than the coast.
