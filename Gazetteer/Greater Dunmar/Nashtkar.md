# Nashtkar

East of the [[~Karawa Desert~]], beyond the borders of [[Dunmar]], is a rocky, arid land called the Nashtkar, or the blasted plains, by the Dunmari. This is a land of strange magic, wild monstrosities, and other unknown dangers, where few dare to venture. This land is less arid than the Garamjala, to the south, and gets occasional rains during the monsoon season. It is rocky, jumbled terrain with many small canyons that unexpectedly flood after the rare monsoon storm and where scrubby plants clinging to life. It is also the western edge of the territory covered by Cha'mutte's Plague during the Great War, and the lingering effects of this devastation still unevenly haunt the land. %% vibe is some places are plague-haunted, but others are not - it is very patchy depending on where large concentrations of people died, mostly %%

The exact borders of this region are ill-defined, but it roughly includes most of the former watershed of the [[Kharja]], bordered on the west by the [[Daraar Canyon]], the north by the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], the south by the [[Garamjala Desert]], and the east by the [[Kulthul]]. 

%% DM Notes

This area featured heavily in the beginnings of the Dunmar Frontier campaign, and there are a lot of vibes in Session Notes (especially the Kharsan/Bhishma arc). There is a lot of brainstorming about plague effects in my Kharsan DM notes, for example.
