Runs east from around Songara, joining the Hara north of Tokra, about 380 miles from its source in the ~Darba Coastal Mountains~. 

Fed by numerous seasonal streams that flow for ~2/3 year, from snowmelt in the Sentinels followed by the summer monsoons. The largest and most consistent of these flow from the Sentinels; only a few infrequent rivers flow from the Copper Hills north.
