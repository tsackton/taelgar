# The Hara Watershed

The Hara Watershed is the river system that drains the central plains of [[Dunmar]]. Its principal river, the [[Hara]], flows from the northern uplands past [[Tokra]], into the lowlands. Seasonal monsoon rains define the rhythm of the watershed: dry winters with low flows, and summers when rivers run full. Culturally, the watershed aligns with [[Central Dunmar]], and the Hara is the lifeblood of this region for the water it provides, though even the major rivers are typically only reliably navigable during the wettest parts of the year. 

The major tributaries of the Hara river include:
- The [[Sone]], which flows east across the [[~Songara Plains~]]
- The [[Sukal]], a seasonal river that flows east from the [[Gazetteer/Greater Dunmar/Darba Highlands/Copper Hills|Copper Hills]]. 
- The [[Thandar]], which flows south from the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and joins the Hara north of [[Tokra]].
