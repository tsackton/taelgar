The river that flows past [[Tokra]]. The major river of the Dunmari Basin. 

%% notes

Starts in the Sentinels, where its main tributaries join north of Tokra ([[Sone]] and [[~Hara Snowmelt Tributary~]])
Flows past Tokra; from Tokra south to Askandi most tributaries are seasonal, except for a few small rivers with sources in the Copper Hills
Past Askandi, enters the Hara River Gorge between the Yuvanti and the Garamjala Plateau
Once, it flowed south to join the Mahar north of Drankor, but whether it still does is anyone's guess
