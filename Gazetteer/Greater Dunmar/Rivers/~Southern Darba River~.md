The Southern Darba River is a seasonal river marking the southern margin of the [[Darba Highlands]]. In the dry months it reduces to a chain of pools and narrow runs; with the onset of the monsoon, it spreads into a broad channel and temporary wetlands. Many travelers treat the crossing as the point where the highland hills give way to the flatter [[Nayan Floodplains]].

Small ferries and fords serve the river during ordinary flows. When the waters are up, travelers wait at caravanserai on the high ground until the current slackens. The riverâ€™s floodplain soils are fertile but fickle, and most permanent settlement sensibly stays back from the main channel.
