# Rudhan

The Rudhan is the principal river of [[Coastal Dunmar]], rising in the uplands of the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]] and flowing southwest across the [[Darba Highlands]] to the [[Nevos Sea]]. Monsoon rains swell the river in summer, flooding riparian forests; in winter its flow slackens, exposing gravel bars and quiet eddies.

Near its mouth stands [[Darba]], a walled port city perched above the flooded swamps of the Rudhan’s estuary. The river’s deep natural harbor and strategic headlands made it attractive to Drankorian builders, and it has been continually occupied since. 

The Rudhan’s valley hosts a chain of small villages, often seasonally settled, along with waystations for travelers along the old [[~Darba-Songara Road~]]. Though no permanent bridges cross the river, it is easily forded in many place during the dry season. During the wet season, ferries provide crossings at many waystations, but the southern banks tend to flood and most travelers stay on the old Drankorian road, which crosses seasonal channels on stone causeways that seem to be able to withstand even the most intense floods.
