# Rudhan

The Rudhan is the principal river of [[Coastal Dunmar]], rising in the upland meadows near the [[~Yuvanti Gap~]] and flowing southwest across the [[Darba Highlands]] to the [[Nevos Sea]]. Monsoon rains swell the river in summer, flooding riparian forests and powering mills; in winter its flow slackens, exposing gravel bars and quiet eddies where barges tie up out of the wind.

Near its mouth stands [[Darba]], a walled port city perched above the flooded swamps of the Rudhan’s estuary. The river’s deep natural harbor and strategic headlands made it attractive to Drankorian builders and later occupants; today, river trade brings timber, grain, and craftwork down to the docks while sea trade carries finished goods and news inland.

The Rudhan’s valley hosts a chain of towns, waystations, and ferries. Managed forests and sawmills line its tributaries, and stone causeways cross seasonal channels to keep the trade roads passable when the waters rise. River pilots mark shifting bars after each flood season, part of the quiet labor that keeps Coastal Dunmar tied to the sea.
