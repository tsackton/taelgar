# Nashtkar
>[!info]+ Information
> A region in the [[Desolation of Cha'mutte]]

%% need to finalize the nashtkar / garamjala / desolation of cha'mutte geography and descriptions; Nashtkar is probably best interpreted as the Dunmari word for "everything east of Shakun's Protection" and not a meaningful geological or hydrological feature %%

The Dunmari name for the desolation east of [[Karawa]], the ruined land cursed by [[Cha'mutte]]'s death. 

%%
The Blasted Plains, the western edge of the [[Desolation of Cha'mutte]]
