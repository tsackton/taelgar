# Gomat
>[!info]+ Information
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

A small oasis on the very eastern edge of [[Dunmar]], about 40 miles east of [[Karawa]]. The oasis is a rocky area with a few bits of scrub, around a somewhat muddy open pool. Some trees provide a bit of shade, and the terrain to the north and west is more scrubland that pure desert. 

The oasis is frequently used as a temporary waystation by the Dunmari. Although there are no permanent habitation here, there are a few permanent structures -- a stone pen for animals, two wells, and a few mud and adobe shelters in the shade, as well as clear space for tents. 

A day's ride east from here is the [[Daraar Canyon]], a massive, unnatural gash in the land, and the eastern edge of [[Dunmar]]. Beyond the canyon rim, Shakun's Protection ceases and the desert becomes increasingly dangerous.
