The Songara Plains are the open grasslands surrounding [[Songara]] in northwestern [[Central Dunmar]]. Broad, windswept and relatively level, the plains support the famed Dunmari horses, along with a wide variety of other grazers, domesticated and wild. Seasonal rains arrive first on the western heights and then sweep east, turning the brown steppe into a quilt of greens before the grasses cure again.
