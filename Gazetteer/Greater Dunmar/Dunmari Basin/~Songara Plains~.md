# The ~Songara Plains~

The Songara Plains are the open grasslands surrounding [[Songara]] in northwestern [[Central Dunmar]]. Broad, windswept and relatively level, the plains support mixed herding and dry‑farming, with denser settlement along shallow river valleys and near caravan routes. Seasonal rains arrive first on the western heights and then sweep east, turning the brown steppe into a quilt of greens before the grasses cure again.

For centuries, the plains have been the stage of border politics and trade between Dunmar and the west. The ancient road north from [[Tokra]] forks toward Songara and the [[Stoneway]], and halfling caravans and merchant trains make regular circuits through the region. Patrols ride the main roads during unsettled times, and signal mounds mark lines of sight across the low ridges.

Local tradition remembers early dynastic victories won here and the rise of rulers from among the clans of the northwest. While the details shift with tellers and seasons, the image endures: wide skies, far horizons, riding under thunderheads on the eve of rain.
