# The ~Southern Tokra Plains~

South of the city of [[Tokra]], the land grows increasingly arid, with little rain even during the monsoon season. The [[Hara]] is the lifeblood of this land. 

To the west, the intermittent streams that flow from the Copper Hills, and the [[Sukal]], support a variety of drought-resistant plants, and provide grazing habitat in wide riparian valleys. To the east, the land turns to arid scrublands as it rises to meet the [[Garamjala Plateau]].
