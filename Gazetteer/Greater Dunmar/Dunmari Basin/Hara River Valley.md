# The Hara River Valley

The Hara River Valley forms the heartland of [[Central Dunmar]], a broad swath of plains and low hills cut by the lazy curves of the [[Hara]] and its many tributaries. The climate is strongly seasonal: dry winters of dust and brown grasses give way to the summer monsoon, when rains sweeping off the western heights swell the river and turn the valley green. Planting and transhumance follow these cycles, and caravans time their departures to avoid the worst of the floods and mud.

Settlements cluster along riparian belts and at caravan junctions. [[Tokra]] sits on a high point above the valley floor, a natural meeting place of roads and river traffic; to the north and east, ranching and goat herding dominate, while farther west and south grain fields expand where irrigation is reliable. The valley road hosts caravanserai spaced a day’s travel apart, linking Tokra to [[Songara]] and points beyond.

In times of uncertainty, the Hara’s banks have served as gathering points—easily defended and supplied by river—while in calmer years the same places bustle with trade and religious festivals. The valley has seen many armies pass and many dynasties rise; its people tend to a practical piety and a keen memory for seasons, roads, and water.
