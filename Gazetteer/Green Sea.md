# The Green Sea

%% named for the phytoplankton blooms that appear in the summer, driven by upwelling associated with the monsoon wind 

Old notes, might not be useful
The Green Sea stretches from the far east to the middle of the continent. To the west, major features are the Cymean peninsula and the islands north and south, including Skaegenland, as well as the Mostreve hills in southern Sembara, and the [[~VostokMountains~]]. In the center and east, major features include a large island centrally located in the middle of the Green Sea, and a large, dense archipelago blocking the mouth of the Green Sea from the Endless Ocean. While the west is densely settled, in the east, along both coasts, most people live close to the ocean: in the north, due to the increasing cold and snow; in the south, the encroaching desert.

  

Population centers in the Western Green Sea include: Greater Sembara, the Cymean peninsula, Greater Vostok (including the Skaer islands), and the center river valley, including [[Isingue]] and [[South Cymea]]


Population centers in the Eastern Gree Sea include: NorthCoast, [[Irrla]] EasternDunmari, FarNorthPeninsula, EntranceIslands, and EastCoast.

The Green Sea forms a rough triangle, with the western point at about 40 degrees North, and the eastern edges stretching from roughly 60 degrees North to roughly 30 degrees North. The Green Sea is split into eastern and western halves, divided by Irrla.

  

In the winter, a zone of high pressure tends to sit over the southernmost parts of the Green Sea (from about 30 N - 35 N), causing light and variable trade winds south of the Irrla, and a dry climate with little precipitation, while strong westerlies blow north of about 35 N. 

  

In the summer, the land to the west heats up and the zone of high pressure shifts polarward. In the western Green Sea, a monsoon wind blows from the east, bringing summer rains to Sembara and Vostok, while in the east, light and variable winds shift northward. In the south, the powerful trade winds blow from the open ocean to the east. 

  

Consequences for trade: sailing east in the northern section of the Green Sea is easy in winter, while sailing west in the southern and western parts are easy in summer. Historically/real world, the distances are kind of on par with the Indian Ocean trade. 

  

In the west, the climate is dominated by the summer monsoons, which brings moisture-laden air and spring/summer rains, getting increasing dry moving south from the Cymean peninsula. 

  

The Irrla has a climate not dissimilar to Japan, with the summer monsoon bringing rain to the southeastern side of the island and the winter westerlies bringing snow to the northwestern side of the island. 

  

The South Coast, from SouthCymea all the way east, tends to be dry, with a climate reminiscent of North Africa “between the mountains,” with almost no rain; only SouthCymea itself trends towards a humid subtropical climate (perhaps Pampas-like). The exception is the far east, east of the mountains, which is much more influenced by the Endless Ocean than the Green Sea, and has a much wetter and warmer climate influenced by the warm currents and prevailing trade wind of the Endless Ocean. 
 

The climate of the western islands is highly varied, being strongly oceanic and influenced by the Green Sea, the Endless Ocean, and magic.   

The North Coast around Skaegenland is heavily maritime, reminiscent of Nova Scotia/Scandinavia, which continues east to the southernmost extend of the North Coast. The northeastern coast, however, is much colder, more reminiscent of eastern Siberia, with long winters and short summers, although the maritime influence moderates the seasonality.
