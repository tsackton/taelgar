# The Green Sea
>[!info]+ Summary
> a sea in [[Taelgar]]

The Green Sea is a large inland sea, surrounded on all sides by significant land masses. To the west, it is bordered by the [[Western Gulf]] and the [[Cymean Peninsula]]; to the north, by the varied islands of [[Skaerhem]] and the strange lands of [[Ursk]]; to the east, the mysterious and magical [[~Eastern Islands~]] separate the Green Sea from the oceans beyond; and a variety of diverse lands to the south. The large island known as [[Irrla]] forms the boundary between the [[Eastern Green Sea]] and the [[Western Green Sea]]. 

Climatically, the [[Western Green Sea]] is dominated by the spring and summer monsoons that bring rain from the ocean to [[Sembara]], [[Cymea]],  [[Tyrwingha]], and [[Vostok]]. The monsoon winds drive upwelling, and the [[Western Green Sea]] is rich in phytoplankton and the marine life that feeds on it, giving the Green Sea the characteristic greenish tint from which its name derives. The [[Eastern Green Sea]], much less affected by the monsoons, and with wider expanses of open water, tends towards maritime climates along the immediate coast, often with drier summers and wet winters. 

The prevailing winds tend to favor sailing east in the winter, and west in the summer, especially along the north and west parts of the ocean, where monsoon winds are most dominant. 

%% Climate explanation - probably too much detail
The Green Sea forms a rough triangle, with the western point at about 40 degrees North, and the eastern edges stretching from roughly 60 degrees North to roughly 30 degrees North. The Green Sea is split into eastern and western halves, divided by Irrla.

In the summer, the land to the west heats up and the zone of high pressure shifts polarward. In the western Green Sea, a monsoon wind blows from the east, bringing summer rains to Sembara and Vostok, while in the east, light and variable winds shift northward. In the south, the powerful trade winds blow from the open ocean to the east. 

In the winter, a zone of high pressure tends to sit over the southernmost parts of the Green Sea (from about 30 N - 35 N), causing light and variable trade winds south of the Irrla, and a dry climate with little precipitation, while strong westerlies blow north of about 35 N. 

Irrla has a climate not dissimilar to Japan, with the summer monsoon bringing rain to the southeastern side of the island and the winter westerlies bringing snow to the northwestern side of the island. 

The South Coast, from SouthCymea all the way east, tends to be dry, with a climate reminiscent of North Africa “between the mountains,” with almost no rain; only SouthCymea itself trends towards a humid subtropical climate (perhaps Pampas-like). The exception is the far east, east of the mountains, which is much more influenced by the ~Great Ocean~ than the Green Sea, and has a much wetter and warmer climate influenced by the warm currents and prevailing trade wind of the  ~GreatOcean~
 
The climate of the western islands is highly varied, being strongly oceanic and influenced by the Green Sea, the ~Great Ocean~ and magic.   

The North Coast around Skaegenland is heavily maritime, reminiscent of Nova Scotia/Scandinavia, which continues east to the southernmost extend of the North Coast. The northeastern coast, however, is much colder, more reminiscent of eastern Siberia, with long winters and short summers, although the maritime influence moderates the seasonality.
