A small sheepherding village along the Great South Road between [[Rinburg]] and [[Dallet]], about 20 miles from [[Rinburg]]. It was depopulated during the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]].

Before it was ruined, it used to be a common stopping spot on the road between [[Rinburg]] and [[Cleenseau]], and the villagers here would rent out sheep barns and haylofts to passing travelers. There was a temple to the Wildling here, but it collapsed in the aftermath of the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]].
