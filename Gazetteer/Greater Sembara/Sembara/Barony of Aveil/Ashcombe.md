The small village of Ashcombe is up in the Maudor Hills and is the heart of fey hunter plot line:
[[The Hunter]]:
* he's been hunting messengers with his packs of harpies
* created a base of sorts in the hills somewhere
* people in Ashcombe have gone missing, in particular William Forester's husband, who is the steward of the forest and the chief lumber-guy
