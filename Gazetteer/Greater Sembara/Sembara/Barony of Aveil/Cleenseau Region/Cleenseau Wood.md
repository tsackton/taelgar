The Wood as it is known locally, is an old growth forest, stretching north of [[Cleenseau]] for what is said to be hundreds of miles. The fringes are used for firewood, charcoal gathering, and pig farming, but after a mile or two it becomes wild and trackless. It forms the boundary between the [[Barony of Aveil]], to the east of the wood, the [[Barony of Dunfry]] and the [[Barony of Usbourg]] to the west, and the [[Barony of Ainwick]] to the north.

There is evidence of a portal to the fey realm of [[Duskmire]] about eight miles inside the wood, although it has not been consistently open.
