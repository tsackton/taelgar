The Manor of Asineau was created after the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]] as a reward for [[Sarabeth Asa]], a scout and spellcaster who distinguished herself during the wars. She never settled into manorial life, and disappeared in 1667, leaving behind her wife and young heir, [[Lucas Asa]], who disappeared with his family in 1715.

Since 1715, the manor has been ruled by [[Lorin Valbert]], who has not been an effective lord. He has had a tendency to sell off land to fund the import of luxuries, and the manorial demesne is quite depleted. In response, [[Lorin Valbert]] has started to impose a market tax on flour, bread, and charcoal, which has not been popular, and well as a tax each spring on any fishing boats. 

Lorin maintains only a small guard, and has appointed himself magistrate, but is not well known for his sense of justice.
