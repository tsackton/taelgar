# The Cleenseau Region

The four manors of [[Manor of Cleenseau|Cleenseau]], [[Manor of Valit|Valit]], [[Manor of Beury|Beury]], and [[Manor of Asineau|Asineau]] form a relatively isolated part of the [[Barony of Aveil]], anchored by the market town of [[Cleenseau]] and its ancient and famous [[Cleenseau Bridge|bridge]] - the only bridge along the [[Enst]] until [[Eskbridge]], far to the east - and the only safe crossing for many miles. Perhaps without the bridge the region would have faded away after the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]], but the bridge and the transportation nexus it creates supports a [[Army Garrison of Cleenseau|garrison]] and market much larger than might be expected. Around these the town of [[Cleenseau]] thrives. 

### Physical Landscape

The region is bounded by the [[Enst]] in the south, [[East Bog|boggy land past Beury]] in the east, the [[Cleenseau Wood]] in the north, and abandoned and rocky scrublands in the west, and is home to seven settlements: [[Cleenseau]] itself, the hamlet of [[Taviose]], the fishing villages of [[Auloutte]] and [[Asineau]], the small village of [[Valit]], the lizardfolk hamlet of [[Ganboa]], and the larger agricultural village of [[Beury]].

The [[Enst]] dominates the landscape. It runs swiftly in the spring from mountain snowmelt, and swells in the late summer when the heavy summer rains come. This far upstream, the river is shallow and wide, and the shoals often shift, making navigation difficult, and no boats come farther upriver than [[Rinburg]], 60 miles downriver. But small fishing rafts do catch the numerous shad and river trout. The lifeblood of the region, however,  are the two major roads that intersect just outside the gates of [[Cleenseau]]: the [[Great South Road]] and the [[South Watch Road]].  

The nearest villages to Cleenseau along the road to the east are the fishing village of [[Auloutte]], nestled along the riverbank, and [[Valit]], an hour’s walk north of the road. A small brook, the [[Amance Brook|Amance]], crosses the road near [[Auloutte]], and the track to [[Valit]] runs north along this brook. A marshy bend in the Enst beyond [[Auloutte]] is the home to [[Ganboa]], a small community of lizardfolk, who are often seen along the riverbanks as far west as [[Cleenseau]]. Beyond the marsh is another fishing village of [[Asineau]], and then [[Beury]], most of a day’s walk to the east. Beyond [[Beury]] the land is wetter and poorly drained, and the [[East Bog]], as the next fifteen miles are sometimes called, is home to several abandoned villages, and said to be haunted by the ghosts of those who died in the old wars. This part of the road is travelled over swiftly, and always in daylight, if possible.

Beyond the marshes the land improves, and there is much good pasture around the village of [[Dallet]], and then beyond that a string of fishing villages and farming towns until, 40 miles past Dallet, the town of [[Rinburg]], at the head of navigation of the Enst - but these places are far outside the region.

Further west, the recently abandoned [[Gastant Farm]], and sits two miles down a track, and the [[South Watch Road]] runs past [[Taviose]], a small hamlet on the edge of the [[Cleenseau Wood|Wood]], and then continues roughly straight for 80 miles through the wilderness until the settlements around [[Dunfry]].  Beyond the abandoned [[Gastant Farm]], the small track continues for about a day's walk before it peters out. Folks say it used to go all the way to the North Fork, a branch of the Enst some hundred and fifty miles away, but now it has been reclaimed by the wild. 

To the south, the rocky shrubland dominates for a hundred miles, before reaching the rolling valleys near [[Valarin]], where most of the people of [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] live. The road used to be dotted with inns and waystations, but these have fallen into disrepair since the Great War. This stretch of road is often called [[Bandit's Way]], and many ex-soliders make a living escorting caravans between [[Cleenseau]] and [[Evis]], the northernmost settlement in [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] along the [[Great South Road]].

### Economy
The region is self-sufficient in food. At a regional level, the major imports are: iron and other metals, mostly from [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]]; ceramics from [[Rinburg]]; glass from [[Ainwick]], and occasionally [[Tyrwingha]], plus luxuries (foodstuffs, alcohol, fine clothes, furniture). The major exports are: weapons and armor and other finished metal goods from Cleenseau; grain (mostly sold west to the army), plus some charcoal to the villages east of the [[East Bog]] with poorer wood supplies.  

The major food crops are:
* Grains are wheat (typically planted in fall and overwintered in the ground), barley (the largest crop), and millet (summer crop, grown on poorer soils). Millet greens are sometimes eaten in early summer. Hay is common and there is generally sufficient pasture if not always of very high quality. 
* Livestock is mostly pigs and sheep, with some small cattle herds mostly for dairy, plus chickens and geese. 
* Other protein sources include significant amounts of fish (shad and trout in spring and fall, eels in late fall/early winter), snails and crayfish, and a small amount of game (grouse/pheasant/turkey like ground birds, mostly, in the lands west of Cleenseau)
* Other vegetable foods include peas and lentils, cabbage, turnips, leeks, onions, daikon radish, and Napa cabbage, nuts (chestnut and walnut, mostly), fruits (apples, plums), and berries (blackberries and raspberries, mostly), and mushrooms

Honey is a commonly used sweetener. Beer is brewed widely and is the main alcoholic drink, alongside some milard (millet-based clear alcohol with a strong earthy flavor and about 45% alcohol content).

The lizardfolk in the region additionally eat a number of foods rarely consumed by humans, both of which grow wild along the marshy parts of the river:
* marsh root, a tuber that grows in thickets along the marsher parts of the river
* marsh millet, a rice-like plant with a nutty flavor

For clothing, the major source of fiber is wool from sheep. There is some small cultivation of hemp mostly for rope and net-making, and reeds and bulrushes are collected along the riverbanks especially for basketry and thatch. Near Beury there are a large number of basswood trees, from which the inner bark harvested for a coarse fiber.  

Wood and charcoal are widely available, mostly from the edges of the [[Cleenseau Wood]], but also from the substantial woodlot between Asineau and Valit. 

The central channels of the Enst, although swift flowing, have good, fine, sandy bottoms, but the sand is not currently exploited as retrieval is a bit of a challenge. Clay is available in small quantities along the river in places, and is used for wattle and daub houses and some small local ceramic production, but most pottery is imported from Rinburg.  

Good stone is not widely available although there is a small industry in Beury collecting hearthstones and bricks from the haunted villages in the bog, and also a good stone quarry on the south side of the Enst that is controlled by Rosalind and her family, although it is not active constantly.

  


**Tavoise**

A tiny hamlet. Mostly supports itself with the charcoal trade. Also a source of tree nuts and apples and plums for Cleenseau, and there are several pig farmers. 

  

I haven't done the same writeup for Asineau but I envision it as the poorest of the three villages. I think my other emails are largely accurate although there is room for refinement given the above (i.e. there is probably hemp cultivation and a larger rope/basket industry than one lone ropemaker, there might be some additional cottage industries, etc)
