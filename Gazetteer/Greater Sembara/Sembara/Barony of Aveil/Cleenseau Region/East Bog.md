# The East Bog

A stretch of fifteen miles along the [[Great South Road]] between [[Beury]] and [[Dallet]] where the land is soggy and the [[Cleenseau Wood]] comes almost to the banks of the [[Enst]]. There are no settlements along this stretch of road, and many rumors that it is haunted. A handful of abandoned villages stand in the muck, and occasionally shelter travelers or squatters with no where else to go. 

During the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]] this area was haunted by zombies.
