Â A bubbling brook that runs into the [[Enst]] near [[Auloutte]], with its origins somewhere in the [[Cleenseau Wood]]. A narrow cart track runs beside it leading to [[Valit]]. It is relatively easy to ford if you don't mind getting your feet wet or if on horseback, but wagons and caravans prefer to use one of the two bridges: the main bridge along the [[Great South Road]], and a smaller one in the town of [[Valit]].
