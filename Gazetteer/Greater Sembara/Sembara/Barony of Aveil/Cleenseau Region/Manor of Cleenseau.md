The town of Cleenseau has an ancient history, but during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|Third Hobgoblin War]] the entire [[Cleenseau Region]] was overrun by hobgoblins, and the existing inhabitants slaughtered or fled. In the aftermath of the war, no heirs could be found and so the manor, as [[Land Holding in Sembara|crownland]], reverted to the [[Baron of Aveil]]. [[Cece I]] granted it to [[Reginald Essford]], a decorated solider and dedicated lord who worked diligently to repopulate the land.

The manor consists of the town of [[Cleenseau]] itself, two hamlets: [[Taviose]] in the eaves of the [[Cleenseau Wood]], and [[Auloutte]], a fishing village, and a wide swath of farmland for about two miles both up and downriver along the Enst. The manor collects income from its significant holdings of agricultural land, as well from a dockage fee for any fishing boats landing catch in [[Auloutte]] and a monopoly on the sale of charcoal in the manor. Additionally, the manor collects a toll for each axle of a wagon that crosses the [[Cleenseau Bridge]] and another toll at the gates of Cleenseau where the [[Old West Road]] joins the [[Great South Road]], only collected from travelers originating from the west, as well as another toll for those wagons crossing the bridge over the [[Amance Brook]] near [[Auloutte]], for traffic originating from the east. 

A small market fee is also collected from several of the town markets, from anyone selling in the markets, including the food vendors along [[Char Street]] and the main town market east of the [[Market Gate]].
