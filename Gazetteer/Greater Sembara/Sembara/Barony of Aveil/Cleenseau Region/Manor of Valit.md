The manor of Valit is part of the demesne of the Baron of Aveil and has been in baronial hands for many years.  It is a small agricultural manor, and mostly is known as the main place for baronial land records in the [[Cleenseau Region]]. It is relatively small, and much of the agricultural land is held freehold, and thus it is the poorest of the four manors in the [[Cleenseau Region]]. The manor borders the lizardfolk village of [[Ganboa]].

The two mills in [[Valit]] are controlled by the manor, and provide the main source of manorial income.
