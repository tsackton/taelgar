The Manor of Valit is part of the demesne of the Baron of Aveil and has been in baronial hands for many years.  It is a mostly known for two things: its three mills, and as the main place for baronial land records in the [[Cleenseau Region]]. Although the manor itself is relatively large, [[Amance Brook]] runs through the middle of the manor, and much of the land to the east of the brook is hilly and hard to farm (and hard to get to from the village over the one small wooden bridge in [[Valit]]). 

There is a small farmstead on the east side of the brook, near the woodlot that separates [[Valit]] from [[Asineau]], which is home to a dozen people, and has recently grown to two sturdy wooden farmhouses and a couple of barns. The rest of the population of the manor lives in the village of [[Valit]]. The manor is relatively poor, as much of the land is held freehold, especially on the eastern side of the brook. There are three mills along the [[Amance Brook]], all of which are controlled by the manor, which provide the majority of the manorial income.
