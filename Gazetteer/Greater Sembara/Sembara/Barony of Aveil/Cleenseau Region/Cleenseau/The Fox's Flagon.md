 A three story inn popular with traders and merchants, but often quiet when no caravan is in town. Known for neither its food (go to [[The River's Blessing]] for that), or drink ([[The Bandit’s End]] is recommended), it is nonetheless a comfortable, secure, and dry place to sleep, and it has a large innyard and stables for traveler's horses. The owner, [[Selma Wisthelwind]] does host storytellers and music, although it is distinctly second to [[The Crossroads Inn]] in that regard. The main gathering room however is large and cheerful, and Selma tends bar most evenings herself. 

The inn was founded during [[Cleenseau|Cleenseau's]] boom after the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|war]], as a business venture, but has changed hands several times and despite its large stables and innyard, it has a reputation in the local business community as a money pit.

[[Viepuck]] spent some time performing here, and is well known if not exactly loved by [[Selma Wisthelwind]]. However, the night during which he recited the tale of the [[Cleenseau Spider Attacks]] with [[Celyn]] in the audience was one of her favorite evenings, the only time her inn outshone the [[The Crossroads Inn]] as the place to be.
