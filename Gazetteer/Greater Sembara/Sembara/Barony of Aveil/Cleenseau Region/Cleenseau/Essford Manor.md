# The Essford Manor

The keep of the lord of Cleenseau, it is set on a small hillock inside the walls, and is defended by its own wooden palisade. 

The manor complex itself consists of four buildings: a stable, a small shrine to the Night Queen, a guardhouse and barracks with several guest rooms, and the three-story manor building itself.

It is built on top of an ancient hobgoblin fort, and in early 1720 a passageway to the abandoned fort was discovered underground, warded with several traps and protections from the Night Queen.

%% There is a bunch of backstory in [[Cleenseau History Notes]] but I don't think it needs to be incorporated into this note 

My DM notes for the dungeon underneath:
The Cleenseau Dungeon consists of three levels:

* The deepest level is the [[ancient Avatus fort]]. 
* Above that is the old Sembaran fort, all buried. This consists of two sections
	* Some rubble that became basements. Basically where a house was built by infill where the Sembaran ruins were filled in. Most of this was actually all filled in with dirt, but some rooms are intact either as basements or just standalone. Hard to get between them though because it is all filled with dirt
		* Some rat tunnels 
	* The main keep, that the hobgoblins turned into the base of their fort
		* 3 levels: 
			* main level connected to the towers
			* old crypt, more recently used as mass grave for the massacred humans
			* the second level, which was the base for the hobgoblin necromancer (long dead) that Reginald was crying about
* Above the Sembaran fort is the hobgoblin fort, which is mostly
	* 3 towers - one full of bones, one intact, one collapsed and filled in
	* new buildings in particular the entrance area under Tumbledown Farm and the passages connecting the towers
	* also the secret exit out to the Crossroads Inn, built by hobgoblins but need to decide why
* Plus there are some other secret tunnels in the Crossroads Inn area, all very narrow. Need to think about why
