The keep of the lord of Cleenseau, it is set on a small hillock inside the walls, and is defended by its own wooden palisade. 

The manor complex itself consists of four buildings: a stable, a small shrine to the Night Queen, a guardhouse and barracks with several guest rooms, and the three-story manor building itself.
