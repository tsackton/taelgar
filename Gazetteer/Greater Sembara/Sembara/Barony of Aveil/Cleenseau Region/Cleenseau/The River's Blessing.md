A quiet place known for its fried trout. This inn is where the villagers from [[Beury]] often stay when bringing goods to market. It has a insular and local vibe, and although strangers are not unwelcome exactly, many prefer to stay at the [[The Fox's Flagon]] or [[The Crossroads Inn]]. 

The building was originally built in 1709 after a bad flood damaged [[The Fox's Flagon]] and [[The Banditâ€™s End]], originally as a temporary venture, by an offshoot of the [[Stonebridges]]. It was sold in 1711 to the Farnham family.
