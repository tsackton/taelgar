An inn and tavern in [[Cleenseau]]. Known for its strong ale, and boisterous bar. A gathering place of veterans and mercenaries who make a living guarding caravans, and numerous small, cramped rooms. It was originally built in the 1650s to house laborers working on rebuilding the town after the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]]. It was converted to an inn in 1665.
