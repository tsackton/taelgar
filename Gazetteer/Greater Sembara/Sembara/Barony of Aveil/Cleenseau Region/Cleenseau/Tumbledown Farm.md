A tenement owned by [[Geoffrey Save]] in [[Underhill]]. It has about fifteen single room apartments, which tend to be cold in winter and hot in summer,  in four stories clustered around a small and dingy courtyard.

There are several storage cellars in the north and western sections with zombie-plague infested rats travelled through. These tunnels eventually connected to the ruined forts underneath Cleenseau.
