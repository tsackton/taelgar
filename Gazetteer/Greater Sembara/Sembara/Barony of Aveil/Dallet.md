A pastoral village known for it's sheep and the first village of east of [[Beury]] along the [[Enst]]. It is built about 500 feet north of the main road, and has three notable buildings: the large manor house, a blacksmith, and a mill. The area east of Dallet along the [[Enst]] is good pasture, although there are no river crossing here and the area south of the [[Enst]] is largely unpopulated scrublands. 

It is a common stopping spot for travelers, who generally prefer to cross the [[East Bog]] in a single day. 

The current lord is Lady [[Elodie Blanchard]]. 

%% Impact of Undead:
Jean Luc responds: "A few days ago out in the pastures to the north the dead rose. Mostly two packs of dead wolves, come alive again, but lead by a skeletal warrior with a sword". He shudders. "May the Father's words reach the Night Queen and keep this from happening again. I feel a sense of anger from him, like this is not the will of the Divine. Anyway, the sheep - and to our great sorrow, several of the herder boys and girls out watching them -- were overwhelmed.  Lady Blanchard's household guard drove them off, but with heavy losses - five of them died."

People are scared for their livelihoods with so much livestock dead, and no one quite knows if they are safe to butcher. So we debate. The Father's guidance has been unclear on this, I fear"
