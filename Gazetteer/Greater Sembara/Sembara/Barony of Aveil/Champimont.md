%%The party spends the evening in the party atmosphere of the grand inn of Champimont, The Elegant Swan. Champimont is a small town, smaller than Cleenseau, but bigger than most of the other villages around here, of maybe 800 or 900 people, perched on a bluff just above the Enst River. It is a common stopping point on the road west. The mood here is one of celebration, and there are about two dozen travellers packed into the Elegant Swan and two other nearby inns, mostly folks fleeing Eftly, or waiting for it to be safe to continue west. The inn is full of rumors, but with a few exceptions (Vahaiya and their people and a few others) everything is just clearly rumors.
