A small village on the [[Great South Road]] between [[Dallet]] and [[Champimont]]. It was recently decimated by the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]] and much of the popluation killed, including most of the lord's guard.

The zombies apparently wandered north towards [[Cleenseau Wood]], and the village is terrified to leave their houses.
