A bustling village which has grown rapidly since 1681 when a bridge was built over the [[Cranmere|Cranmère]]. It has a small unnamed inn which caters to travelers, and the temple of [[The Warlord]] the was destroyed in the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]].

The most prominent building is the large manor house with a elaborate garden, but second in prominence is the tollhouse complex by the bridge.
