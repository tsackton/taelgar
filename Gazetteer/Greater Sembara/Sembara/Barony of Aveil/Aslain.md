Aslain is a busy market town near the confluence of the [[Auberonne]] and [[Leandre]] rivers in the [[Barony of Aveil]]. The town, and much of the farmland to the east along the banks of the [[Auberonne]], is historically controlled by the [[d'Aslains|d'Aslain]] family. It is not fortified, and was rebuilt during the reign of [[Cece I]] after the ravages of the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]], across the river from the ancient town of the same name, now in ruins. This is a rich argicultural region, but the town does not have any large industries or significant trade, other than a small number of halflings mostly plying the cloth trade. This is too far north for the timber trade in Aveil, although some masonry and stone does make its way downriver to Rinburg, for building.

There is a large temple to [[The Mother]] here, and a small and still once-active temple to [[The Night Queen]] in the ruins across the river, as well as two inns: [[The Resting Ox]] and [[The Setting Sun]].

There is a large dwarven community here, mostly [[Ferrystones]], who specialize in rebuilding with reclaimed stones, and are renowned in the region for their work at reclaiming stone from the old town ruins. 

In DR 1720, the Temple to the Night Queen was destroyed on suspicion of harboring necromancies, in response to the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]]. The temple was never rebuilt, and the small community in the old town ruins has dispersed to Aslain or moved south to [[Rinburg]].
