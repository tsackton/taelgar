Aslain is a busy market town at the confluence of the [[Auberonne]] and [[Leandre]] rivers in the [[Barony of Aveil]]. The town, and much of the farmland to the east along the banks of the [[Auberonne]], is historically controlled by the baron of [[Barony of Aveil|Aveil]].

It is not fortified, and was rebuilt during the reign of [[Cece I]] after the ravages of the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]], across the river from the ancient town of the same name, now in ruins.
