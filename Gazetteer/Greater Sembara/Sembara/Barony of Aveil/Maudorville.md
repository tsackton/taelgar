Maudorville is an ancient place, it was far enough north that it didn't fall in the hobgoblin wars. 
timber trade, nearish river, old buildings, temple is impressive 2 story with moon carvings
Temple of Sibyl here, administrator is Wilhelm, moon guy.

Temple of Sibyl was founded after a moonlight square (it was a perfect square) healed all those inside the square
recently moon lore vs other aspects of Sibyl has become important
