A small line of hills in the northern part of the [[Barony of Aveil]], it rises steeply from the [[Auberonne]] valley to a height of almost three thousand feet - more than fifteen hundred feet above the valley floor. This is difficult land to farm, with many sheer granite cliffs rising 200' or 300' feet, and numerous steep escarpments that are less sheer.  Outside of a few scattered communities of goatherders, this area is not populated.

It is known for two things: as a guerilla redoubt used by Sembarans during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]] and as a source of tin. There are two tin mines in the northern slopes of the ridge, controlled by the [[Duchy of Wisford]]. The [[Aveil Road]] runs from the mining town of [[Selestat|SÃ©lestat]] in the north side of the ridge to the [[Wistel]] river. 

During the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]] the caves in the Aveil Ridge were haunted by hundreds of zombies that took several months to clear out.
