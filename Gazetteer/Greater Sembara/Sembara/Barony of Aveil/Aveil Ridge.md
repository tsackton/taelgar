A small line of hills in the northern part of the [[Barony of Aveil]], it rises steeply from the [[Auberonne]] valley to a height of almost three thousand feet - more than fifteen hundred feet above the valley floor. This is difficult land to farm, with many granite cliffs rising 200' or 300' feet.  Outside of a few scattered communities of goatherders, this area is not populated.

It is known for two things: as a guerilla redoubt used by Sembarans during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]] and as a source of tin. There are two tin mines in the northern slopes of the ridge, controlled by the [[Duchy of Wisford]]. The [[Aveil Road]] runs from the mining town of [[Selestat|SÃ©lestat]] in the north side of the ridge to the [[Wistel]] river.
