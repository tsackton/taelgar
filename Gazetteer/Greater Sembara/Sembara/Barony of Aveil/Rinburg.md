A trading town at the head of navigation of the [[Enst]]. A busy ferry crosses the river here, and it is one of the few points to cross the river until [[Cleenseau]], a hundred miles further west. The landscape around Rinburg is pastrol fields and farms, and there is much good sheepland within two days ride.

Rinburg is a free city, not under the control of any baron, and owes taxes and allegiance to the [[Duchy of Wisford]].
