The largest city in the [[Duchy of Wisford]] and the traditional seat of the Duke. It is a busy place at the intersection of the [[Great South Road]], the [[Tyrwinghan Road]], and the [[Wistel]], and more cosmopolitan than most Sembaran cities. It is divided into two sections, the North Bank and the South Bank, split by the [[Wistel]], and the ducal palace sits on an small island in the middle of the river, said to have been created as a gift from the gods many years ago.
