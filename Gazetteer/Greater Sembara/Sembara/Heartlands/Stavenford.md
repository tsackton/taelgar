A small river town in the Duchy of Wisford along the [[Enst]], it is about 20 miles downriver of [[Fellburn]]. There is a ferry here. Historically there was a significant fortification here, but the "new town" which was built in the 1670s after the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]] dismantled the fortifications to use as building material. 

%% No information really made up, this is basically just a place because I needed a town past Fellburn %%
