A populous and fortified town along the [[Enst]], it was historically the "second city" of the Enst, smaller than [[Rinburg]]. However, since the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]], Fellburn has grown substantially and has overtaken [[Rinburg]] to become the largest city along the Enst. 

%% I'm working on various ideas to give this place character, given it has come up in Cleenseau as an "important" place. Canonically there is no bridge, so need to come up with some reasons why a big city here%%
