A populous and fortified town along the [[Enst]], it was historically the "second city" of the Enst, smaller than [[Rinburg]]. However, since the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]], Fellburn has grown substantially and has overtaken [[Rinburg]] to become the largest city along the Enst.
