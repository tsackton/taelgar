A populous and fortified town along the [[Enst]], it was historically the "second city" of the Enst, smaller than [[Rinburg]]. However, since the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]], Fellburn has grown substantially and has overtaken [[Rinburg]] to become the largest city along the Enst. 

%% I'm working on various ideas to give this place character, given it has come up in Cleenseau as an "important" place. Canonically there is no bridge, so need to come up with some reasons why a big city here

The Fell Burn, the Beacon of Fate in the ancient language of the original settlers of the Enst river valley, is a twisting crystalline structure, almost tree-like in form, perched on a rise above the Enst. For as long as anyone can remember, it has been said that, when the light of sunrise is reflected in its twists and turns, the crystals sing, in a language no one knows, but the song sings of hope, of comfort. those who make the pilgrimage in the night, and reach the crystals as the sun rises, say that they hear in the song the answers to doubts that have haunted them. Before the Drankorians came, the songs were thought to be Kestavan songs, and the Fell Burn was a sacred place. To the Drankorians, it was many things, and strange rumors spread. The most persistant was that, according to the Drankorian mages, it was a fragment of the moment of creation, frozen in time. The Drankorians built a fortification, and soon after a library, and it became a frequent site of travel and study, and the town of Fellburn grew. Many forgot the original meaning of Fellburn, and it acquired many names: the Singing Tree, in the colloquial, the Crystal of Time, among the wizards, and simply the Oracle of Hope to most. After the Fall of Drankor, Fellburn persisted - in these days, much seemed dark, and many sought the hope and comfort of the Oracle. Some in these days thought it was a miracle of the Wyrdling, or perhaps the Sibyl, but the priests never claimed a divine presence. As Sembara grew, Fellburn came to prosper. It was never the greatest economic powerhouse of the Enst, for the river was too wide here for a crossing, even in Drankorian days (or, the hills on either side too steep), and with no easy harbors it did not lend itself to a riverboat port. But, the pilgrims always came, and with them coin, and so the city grew.
