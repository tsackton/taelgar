# Embry

Embry is the capital city of [[Sembara]], perched on a bluff above the [[Semb]]. It is the seat of the royal court, and a busy river port where grain and wool from upriver are unloaded from barges and sold on to [[Tollen|Tollender]] and [[Halflings|halfling]] merchants bound for [[Tollen]] and the wider [[Green Sea]]. 

For all its size and power, Embry remains a rural-facing and pastoral city. Temples to the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] are prominent, but the wealth of the court and nobility rests on the harvests and sheep from their agricultural holdings in the hinterlands.
