Embry is a major city of the Sembaran heartlands, a river‑bound hub where provincial roads meet warehouses and counting houses. Known for its orderly wards and active merchant courts, Embry balances agricultural trade with craft guilds in textiles, leather, and river shipping.

## Districts and Trade
Quays along the main channel are crowded with barges and lighters, while upland markets host wool and grain exchanges. A civic assembly and magistrates administer law; guildhalls line streets near the central square.

## Culture and Faith
Temples to the principal gods are found across several plazas rather than in a single precinct, reflecting Embry’s preference for distributed institutions. Winter fairs and spring regattas mark the city’s calendar.

DM notes
- Anchor city for heartland travel and commerce; flexible enough to host guild intrigue, river plots, and legal drama.
