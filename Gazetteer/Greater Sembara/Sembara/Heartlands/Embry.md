# Embry

Embry is the capital city of [[Sembara]], perched on a bluff above the [[Semb]]. It is the seat of the royal court, and a busy river port where grain and wool from upriver are unloaded from barges and sold on to [[Free City of Tollen|Tollender]] and halfling merchants bound for [[Tollen]] and the wider [[Green Sea]].

For all its size and power, Embry is often described as an inward-looking and pastoral city. Temples to the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] are prominent, and the wealth of the court and nobility rests as much on harvests and herds as on coin and trade.

Embry sits astride two ancient routes: the [[Great North Road]], linking the [[Wistel]] valley and [[Wisford]] to the heartlands; and the [[Great South Road]], which runs south toward [[Cassons]] and, beyond, the ruins and dangers of the [[Plaguelands]].

Anchor city for heartland travel and commerce; flexible enough to host guild intrigue, river plots, and legal drama.

Embry is a major city of the Sembaran heartlands, a river‑bound hub where provincial roads meet warehouses and counting houses. Known for its orderly wards and active merchant courts, Embry balances agricultural trade with craft guilds in textiles, leather, and river shipping.

Quays along the main channel are crowded with barges and lighters, while upland markets host wool and grain exchanges. A civic assembly and magistrates administer law; guildhalls line streets near the central square.

Temples to the principal gods are found across several plazas rather than in a single precinct, reflecting Embry’s preference for distributed institutions. Winter fairs and spring regattas mark the city’s calendar.

## DM notes

- Population appears inconsistent: frontmatter lists `population: 25000`, while [[Heartlands]] describes Embry as “approximately 50,000 souls”. Review needed.
- `_dm_notes/_Whitesparrow Trouble/Setting.md` places a trade crossroads at “Blackwater Bridge” on the upper Semb, with wool and other goods moving downriver toward Embry; it also describes rapids limiting river traffic near that town (may be a local condition vs the Semb’s broader navigability).
- `_dm_notes/_Ausson's Crossing/Ausson's Crossing NPCs.md` includes a halfling caravan from Chardon bound for Embry (useful hook for overland trade/rumor delivery).
