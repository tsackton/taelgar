# The Heartlands

The heartlands are a rich agricultural region in the lowlands between the [[Enst]], in the south, and the [[Teft]], in the north. Much of this region, around the River [[Semb]], is the [[Duchy of Sembara]], a powerful and rich farming region, control of which is the source of much of the monarchâ€™s power. This land is the breadbasket of [[Sembara]].

Four other powerful duchies make up the rest of the heartlands: the [[Duchy of Wisford]], around the [[Wistel]] River and stretching south to the [[Enst]]; the [[Duchy of Arnsbury]], in the north; the [[Duchy of Cheimen]], in the west between the [[Semb]] and [[Wistel]] rivers; and the [[Duchy of Seham]] along the coast.

The largest city in the heartlands, and the capital city of Sembara, is [[Embry]]. Perched on a bluff above the [[River Semb]], the capital city of [[Embry]] is a bustling river port of approximately 50,000 souls. Embry is home to the royal court, and is bustling river port where grain and wool from upriver are off-loaded from river barges and loaded onto [[Free City of Tollen|Tollender]] and halfling ocean-going boats for shipment to [[Free City of Tollen|Tollen]] or further east in the Green Sea. It is also a major religious center for [[Mos Numena]] and contains significant temples to all of the Eight Divines. For all its size and importance, it is fundamentally an inward looking and pastoral place. The nobility grow rich selling surplus agricultural goods to the Tollender's and halflings but for all its wealth it has smaller markets and fewer goods for sale than [[Free City of Tollen|Tollen]] or [[Telham]].

Dating to Drankorian times, the city boasts that it has never been taken by siege, and the great northern gates are said to have been built by ancient Drankorian magic.

It sits along the [[Great North Road]], a major road running from [[Wisford]], on the [[River Wistel|Wistel]] River, north to [[Embry]], across the [[River Teft]], and finally to the [[Free City of Tollen]]. This road is kept safe from bandits, and south of Embry it is often choked with caravans, both halfling and local Sembarans, bringing wool and grain from the rich Wistel River Valley north to Embry for sale. North of Embry, although the road is popular with travelers heading to Telham or Tollen, there is little trade.
#### The Economy of the Heartlands
The heartlands is the economic center of Sembara and is based on two main commodities: wool and wheat. The Semb and Wistel river valleys are extremely fertile and support dense agricultural production of wheat mixed with sheep and cattle grazing. The Duchy of Cheimin, in particular, is known for Chemin wool, a highly valued and exceptionally soft wool that is traded extensively to Tollen.

The area around Fellburn and the Enst boasts numerous cattle and sheep, and is particularly known for its leather and cheese, both of which are traded throughout Sembara.
