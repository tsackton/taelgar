%% borders Tyrwingha; probably older than most of the rest of borderlands %%

The Barony of Chantelierre lies along the Tyrwinghan frontier, a land of old roads, hedgerow farms, and watch‑keeps inherited from earlier marches. Its lords balance the demands of frontier defense with the needs of trade flowing toward [[Tafolwern]] and the Sembaran interior.

## Landscape and Settlements
Low ridges and river flats define the barony, with small market towns serving as collection points for grain, wool, and timber. Ancestral manors and newer blockhouses sit astride the roads in alternating patterns that reflect successive eras of threat and peace.

## History and Role
Chantelierre’s roots predate later reorganizations of the Borderlands; its halls retain older customs and ties across the Tyrwinghan line. Skirmish scars and memorial stones are common along the byways.

DM notes
- Use as a stable but vigilant border barony; leverage Tyrwinghan cultural echoes and older legal charters.
