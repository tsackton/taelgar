%% 
Historically much larger; conqueored by Shattered Ice Clan; refounded after war in very different way

Should have a "fortified frontier" vibe in some places, although the details are light. Hilly with scattered forests and deep valleys, not an easy land to navigate.
Came up in game only so far as to be mentioned as a place a small group of soldiers wandered through, somewhat lost

The [[Timeline of Sembaran History]] hints at some of the events here during the Shattered Ice time; the main thing is that the Shattered Ice Clan conquered this land as settlers during the period between the 2nd and 3rd hobgoblin wars, and then brutalized it during the 3rd hobgoblin war. 

tagged status/check/mike as it feels there are vibes not captured below, but hard to tell. i don't have a clear mental picture of any of the borderlands, really.

The Barony of Vaubonne occupies a rugged tract of southern Sembara, in the rugged terrain between the [[Enst]] valley to the north and the [[Mostreve Hills]] to the south. Its forested ridges and deep valleys create a patchwork of fortified villages and narrow passes; navigation here is hard, and travel is difficult.
