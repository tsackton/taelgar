%% 
Historically much larger; conqueored by Shattered Ice Clan; refounded after war in very different way

Should have a "fortified frontier" vibe in some places, although the details are light. Hilly with scattered forests and deep valleys, not an easy land to navigate.
Came up in game only so far as to be mentioned as a place a small group of soldiers wandered through, somewhat lost

The [[Timeline of Sembaran History]] hints at some of the events here during the Shattered Ice time; the main thing is that the Shattered Ice Clan conquered this land as settlers during the period between the 2nd and 3rd hobgoblin wars, and then brutalized it during the 3rd hobgoblin war.
