The Barony of Vaubonne occupies a rugged tract of southern Sembara, in the terrain between the [[Enst]] valley to the north and the [[Mostreve Hills]] to the south. Its forested ridges and deep valleys create a patchwork of fortified villages and narrow passes; navigation here is hard, and travel is difficult. There are few roads and little trade, although stretches of the Clavert are placid and frequently navigated by small dugout boats.

The barony has ancient roots, tracing its lineage back to one of the Drankorian border provinces along the [[Enst]]. Historically, the baron held sway over the entire valley bordered by the Enst in the north and the [[Clavert]] in the south. For many years, the baron was a vassal of the [[Duchy of Wisford]], although after the collapse of the [[Dominion of Avatus]] the right to appoint the baron was claimed by the Sembaran throne.

The [[Second Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]] and [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]] devasted the region, and the entire barony was overrun by hobgoblins for many years. This was a difficult time for the people here, although the hobgoblins of the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] were mostly cruel task-masters interested in extracting value, and not actually genocidal. But all of the best land was taken by hobgoblins, and maintaining any sort of arms was banned. The entire manorial system collapsed in these days, and many records of landownership were lost.

When [[Cece I]] restored this region after the victories of the [[Radiant Alliance]], much of the land was given to loyalists and supporters, both to buttress the southern flanks of Sembara with battle-tested captains, and reward those who had risked much in her wars. 

Today, the barony is a mix of ancient families who trace their lineage back before the hobgoblin occupation, and newcomers from [[Embry]] and the [[Duchy of Sembara]], mostly, eager for land-grants and opportunities. Tensions arise occasionally, although the ancient families are outnumbered and out of power, and mostly are resigned to the new barony.
