The Sembaran Borderlands is a name for the baronies between the [[Aure]] in the east, the [[Enst]] in the north, and the [[Mostreve Hills]] in the south. These baronies are mostly newly established since the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]], and are traditionally quite loyal to the crown. 

They run, from west to east: 
* [[Barony of Estrive]], near [[Lake Rin]]
* [[Barony of Montse|Barony of Montsé]], near [[Fellburn]], to the west
* [[Barony of Vauclaire]], near [[Fellburn]], to the east
* [[Barony of Serest]],  bordered on the east by the [[Clavert]]
* [[Barony of Chantelierre]], bordered on the east by the [[Aure]]

South of these baronies is the remains of the ancient [[Barony of Vaubonne]], bordered on the south by the [[Clavert]].  South of the [[Clavert]] are the two border baronies: the [[Barony of Brumecliff]], in the west, and the [[Barony of Mostreve|Barony of Mostrevé]], in the east.
