# The Barony of Estrive

%% other than location (see [[Borderlands]]) no real details exist; would almost certainly have been created post hobgoblin wars or at least occupied by hobgoblins during war %%

Estrive holds a stretch of the western marches facing the old war‑roads. Its keeps and villages trace the lines of campaign trails, with more recent settlement layering over the scars of the Hobgoblin Wars. Today, Estrive’s towns serve caravans, garrisons, and the hill farms that provision both.

## Defensive Posture
Watchtowers on barrow‑tops and ditch‑and‑bank earthworks guard fords and crossroads. Local levies drill each autumn alongside professional soldiers bound for the [[Western Wall of Sembara]].

## Trade
Wool, smoked meats, and seasoned oak move east; ironware and salt move west. Estrive’s markets are practical rather than fashionable, marked by remount corrals and smithies.

DM notes
- Borderland barony with explicit wartime layers in its geography. Strong fit for patrol, supply, or refugee scenarios.
