# The Barony of Vauclaire
*(Voh-klair)*

The Barony of Vauclaire is one of the small realms of the [[Borderlands]], a chain of baronies along Sembara’s southern frontier between the [[Enst]] and the [[Mostreve Hills]]. It lies near [[Fellburn]], east of the [[Barony of Montse|Barony of Montsé]].

In the common telling, the Borderlands are young in their current form—newly established and reorganized in the wake of the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]]—and are known for their loyalty to the Sembaran crown.
