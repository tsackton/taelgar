# The Barony of Vauclaire

%% Nothing really exists about this place except the hints in the borderlands page %%

Vauclaire stands among the western marches as a chain of manors and fortified towns linked by patrol roads and signal mounds. Its lords oversee mixed agriculture and pasture under a system shaped by generations of frontier service.

## Economy and Settlements
Vineyards on warmer slopes and barley fields in the hollows supply local tables; timber and lime support ongoing works. Market days draw drovers and soldiers, and inns keep spare cots for couriers moving along the wall‑roads.

## Character
Pragmatic and watchful. The coat‑of‑arms appears often on waystones, and the habit of setting ward‑fires before storms persists from older times.

DM notes
- Treat as a flexible, archetypal border barony for travel and garrison stories; specifics can be customized per campaign.
