# The Western Wall of Sembara

%% This is the wall to the west of Sembara; Dunfry and so on. Proposal is to keep this name - "Western Wall" %%

The Western Wall of Sembara is a chain of fortifications—stone curtain walls, towers, redoubts, and ditches—built in successive phases to secure the frontier against incursions. It runs across the western marches, anchored by strongpoints such as [[Dunfry]] and supplied by towns like [[Dunmore]].

## Construction and Phases
Older Drankorian foundations appear in places, but the present alignment reflects expansions after the Blood Years and the Hobgoblin Wars. Masonry varies by section, with local stone and lime used according to availability.

## Garrison and Signals
Watch companies man the towers and maintain beacon chains along prominent ridges. In peacetime, skeleton crews keep the works in repair; in wartime, the wall bristles with siege engines and pennons.

DM notes
- Treat the wall as a flexible stage for patrols, sieges, and political tug‑of‑war between baronies. Use beacons as plot devices for rapid mobilization.
