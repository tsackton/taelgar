%% Tim: removed notes about how it was constructed; I'd like to incorporate the flavor into the text %%

The Western Wall of Sembara is an impressive chain of fortifications, including extensive stone curtain walls, towers, and redoubts, supported by long a series of ditches. It runs across the western marches, anchored by the garrison towns of [[Dunfry]] in the south and [[Dunmore]] in the north.

The construction occurred after the Great War and was complete by the middle of Cece's reign. Was almost certainly at least in part, if not entirely, constructed with magic.

The text above likely needs some updates in order to reflect the mysterious and magical nature of this wall, it was not built by human laborers over dozens of years. It likely was created in at least two phases, and perhaps a third phase of human construction extended it.
