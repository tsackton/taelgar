The Western Wall of Sembara is an impressive chain of fortifications, including extensive stone curtain walls, towers, and redoubts, supported by long a series of ditches. It was built in successive phases to secure the western frontier against incursions after the [[Great War]]. It runs across the western marches, anchored by strongpoints such as [[Dunfry]] and supplied by towns like [[Dunmore]].

Could use some invention around timing of construction. 

This is the wall to the west of Sembara; Dunfry and so on. Proposal is to keep this name - "Western Wall"
