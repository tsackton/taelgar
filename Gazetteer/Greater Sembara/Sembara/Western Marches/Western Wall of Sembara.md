%% This is the wall to the west of Sembara; Dunfry and so on. Proposal is to keep this name - "Western Wall" %%

Is there any canon on how/when the wall in western Sembara was built?

[10/30/2023 8:59 PM] .deciusmus
Did it exist in the one-shot against the stone titan?

my notes from the stone titan one-shot are pretty ambiguous about whether the western sembara fortifications exist at that time

[10/30/2023 9:02 PM] rsulfuratus
that works imo

[10/30/2023 9:08 PM] .deciusmus
Right. So maybe its just been a continual project since way back in the immediate aftermath of the Great War that has grown in fits and starts

I'm leaning towards "the Sentinel Range War" in the early 1560s (mostly the highland kingdoms and dwarves) being against something really scary and inspiring a period of fortifications in the 1560s in the west, which seem prophetic when the 1st hobgoblin war is in that area.

The wall is extended in the 1570s after the 1st hobgoblin war, but the 2nd and 3rd hobgoblin wars are fought along the Enst, not the western frontier


[10/30/2023 9:07 PM] .deciusmus
Cece then, during the long peace, invests a fair bit in border defense, which includes strengthing and supporting Maseau and Addermarch and wall-building in the west


[10/30/2023 9:07 PM] rsulfuratus
the original reason for the wall on the map was the idea that the devastion around Urlich is still a cursed place and occasionally spawns weird monsters and other terrors that need to be stopped



[10/30/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
(weird terrors from Urlich is important for the long-term plot arc of my game as that's where the underdark section is intended to be)


[10/30/2023 9:09 PM] .deciusmus
But, the wall is also the only part of Sembara that isn't defended by a river or an allied kingdom


[10/30/2023 9:11 PM] rsulfuratus
Dunmore at least was a fortified border town during the 1st hobgoblin war, presuming that is the setting for the stone titan one shot (never canonically had a year just "aftermath of great war")


[10/30/2023 9:12 PM] rsulfuratus
but actually probably makes sense for their not to be a wall there in 1570 or whenever - especially as in the 1550s Sembara is in pretty dire straights in general and might not have had resources for a huge wall project


[10/30/2023 9:13 PM] rsulfuratus
maybe the central section is first right after great war, and slowly grows north and south until it meets rivers or something


[10/30/2023 9:14 PM] rsulfuratus
not sure it matters a ton though the exact timing, unless relevant for your war pacing


[10/30/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
No, it isn't relevant


[10/30/2023 9:14 PM] .deciusmus
Was just thinking about it as an aside
