# Enford

An important garrison town on the south banks of the [[Enst (North Fork)|North Fork]]. It is a bustling place supported primarily as an army depot and a departure point for trade and adventure in the [[Marches of Enford]]. 

%% A few notes:
* Undecided if there is a bridge or just a good fording spot / ferry over the river
* Badly suffered during the undead attacks by a caravan of skeletons lead by a mummy or three
* Very military outpost vibe, but unlike say the Roman camps along the Danube, there isn't a Germanic population nearby. The marches have only slowly been repopulated.

Otherwise not much has been invented although it will eventually be a key place in the Cleenseau campaign so be cautious about putting lots of stuff here
