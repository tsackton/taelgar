%% Tim: some new invention/expanded notes %%
Dunmore is a fortified town of the western marches, positioned to service and supply the garrisons along the [[Western Wall of Sembara]]. Its stout gates and stone‑lined streets reflect its role as a military entrepôt, though it also serves as a market for surrounding farms and quarries.

Before the raising of the [[Western Wall of Sembara]], Dunmore stood closer to the open frontier and bore the character of a true border town. Successive expansions of fortifications and the growth of the [[Army of the West]] in particular after the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]] have drawn it into a more structured support role, as the major town supporting the [[North Watch]], and in particular the [[Regiment of the Wall]].  Soldiers stationed along the north and central sections of the wall return here for rest and relaxation, and the historical border town character sometimes still peaks through the stoneworks, granaries, and smithies that support the army.

Tim: The "Dunmore (OneNote)" is a dead link. Suggest we lean into the "very similar to Dunfry". These - whatever there different pasts - are today the two major garrison towns of the Army of the West and should have similar feel. However I think Dunmore is the wilder of the too - more of a place where off duty soliders run around in the streets and such - Dunfry has more of a command-and-officers feel

some notes from starter stone titan adventure, in particular [[Dunmore (OneNote)]] and [[Setup]]

could you some invention as to how different from [[Dunfry]] or maybe it isn't it is just on the northern part of the wall. They both have "Dun" in the name.... maybe lean into the similarity

in Clee game has a very similar to vibe as Dunfry - army place, mostly important as a town along the wall to service the army. Nothing important made up about it that isn't in backlinks here esp the [[Army of the West]] page
