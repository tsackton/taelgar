Setting status/tim for details about stone titan adventure if there is anything you want to copy over/add 

Was in the "starter" adventure with the stone titan; although not clear if that is canonical.

could you some invention as to how different from [[Dunfry]] or maybe it isn't it is just on the northern part of the wall. They both have "Dun" in the name.... maybe lean into the similarity

in Clee game has a very similar to vibe as Dunfry - army place, mostly important as a town along the wall to service the army. Nothing important made up about it that isn't in backlinks here esp the [[Army of the West]] page

In the late 1500s was probably before the western wall was raised and therefore much more frontier-town-eseque
