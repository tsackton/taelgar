Dunmore is a fortified town of the western marches, positioned to service and supply the garrisons along the [[Western Wall of Sembara]]. Its stout gates and stone‑lined streets reflect its role as a military entrepôt, though it also serves as a market for surrounding farms and quarries.

Before the raising of the current western wall, Dunmore stood closer to the open frontier and bore the character of a true border town. Successive expansions of fortifications have drawn it into a more structured support role.

some notes from starter stone titan adventure, in particular [[Dunmore (OneNote)]] and [[Setup]]

could you some invention as to how different from [[Dunfry]] or maybe it isn't it is just on the northern part of the wall. They both have "Dun" in the name.... maybe lean into the similarity

in Clee game has a very similar to vibe as Dunfry - army place, mostly important as a town along the wall to service the army. Nothing important made up about it that isn't in backlinks here esp the [[Army of the West]] page

In the late 1500s was probably before the western wall was raised and therefore much more frontier-town-eseque
