%% 
some notes from starter stone titan adventure to copy over, potentially

could you some invention as to how different from [[Dunfry]] or maybe it isn't it is just on the northern part of the wall. They both have "Dun" in the name.... maybe lean into the similarity

in Clee game has a very similar to vibe as Dunfry - army place, mostly important as a town along the wall to service the army. Nothing important made up about it that isn't in backlinks here esp the [[Army of the West]] page

In the late 1500s was probably before the western wall was raised and therefore much more frontier-town-eseque
%%

Dunmore is a fortified town of the western marches, positioned to service and supply the garrisons along the [[Western Wall of Sembara]]. Its stout gates and stone‑lined streets reflect its role as a military entrepôt, though it also serves as a market for surrounding farms and quarries.

## Role and Infrastructure
Storehouses, remount stables, and armories occupy plots near the walls. The town mint marks contracts and pay chits during active campaigns. In quieter years, the market square fills with wool merchants and mule trains.

## History
Before the raising of the current western wall, Dunmore stood closer to the open frontier and bore the character of a true border town. Successive expansions of fortifications have drawn it into a more structured support role.
