# The Western Marches

The Western Marches of Sembara encompass all of the lands west of the ancient baronies of [[Barony of Ainwick|Ainwick]] and [[Barony of Aveil|Aveil]]. The land suffered greatly in the [[Great War]], and the hobgoblin wars that followed, and has only slowly recovered. It is still sparsely populated, and the [[Army of the West]] is the dominant institution in the region. The two military baronies - [[Barony of Usbourg|Usbourg]] and [[Barony of Dunfry|Dunfry]] - were created during the reign of [[Cece I]].

The Western Marches are divided into three regions: 
* the [[Marches of Enford]], in the foothills between the north and central branches of the River Enst 
* the military baronies, amongst the flat lands north of the Enst
* the [[Marches of Brovna]], north of the Wistel. 

Much of this land was war-torn and devastated by the [[First Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|western hobgoblin wars]], and it remains an underpopulated area. The Marches of Enford and much of the Barony of Dunfry in particular were overrun and subjugated by hobgoblins during the wars of the 1590s, and the marks of that occupation on the land and the people are still evident. 

The [[Marches of Enford]] are a land of frontier lords. Much of the land here has been granted freehold in large tracks, subject only to an oath to defend the land. It can be quite dangerous, but there is much opportunity here as well.

The [[Barony of Usbourg]] is more a military district in some ways than a barony. There are two major garrisons of troops stationed here: the North Watch and the Central Watch. The North Watch maintains a line of castles from the Wistel to the river border with [[Ardlas]]; the Central Watch is responsible for the northern part of the [[Western Wall of Sembara]]. These garrisons are supported by the crown, and much of the economy of the region is dedicated to feeding, equipping, and supporting them.Â 
 
The [[Barony of Dunfry]] is also a major military district, responsible for the South Watch, which guards the southern half of the [[Western Wall of Sembara]], and also maintains a series of forts along the north branch of the Enst.

The [[Marches of Brovna]] have much in common with [[Ardlas]], and like in the [[Marches of Enford]] large parcels of land have been granted freehold to anyone who will pledge to defend the land.
