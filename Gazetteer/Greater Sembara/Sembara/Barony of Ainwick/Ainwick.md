A town in western Sembara, on the upper reaches of the River Wistel. This is an important communication and market hub for the upper reaches of the [[Wistel]] river. Although the [[Army of the West]] is based further west, along the [[Western Wall of Sembara]], Ainwick is in many ways the spiritual heart of the army.
