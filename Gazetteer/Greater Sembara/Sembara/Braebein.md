The Braebein forms the western and northern borders of the [[Duchy of Arnsbury]], and marks the beginning of the long climb of land towards the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] that distinguishes the Sembaran [[Highlands]] and [[Zimkova]].

The hills are a productive source of silver and marble. 

%% Note - should be extended on the map to stretch more clearly to the Volta, which forms a gap between these hills and the [[~Volta Hills~]] %%
