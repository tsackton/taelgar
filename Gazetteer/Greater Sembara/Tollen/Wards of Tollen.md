# Wards of Tollen

(1) **[[Skepwalk]]** is the busy sea-facing waterfront of Tollen, lined with deep quays, cranes, and warehouses where tall-masted ships load and unload cargo from across the Green Sea.

(2) **[[Fiskurth]]** is the fishing ward, a cramped stretch of low docks, fish-stalls, and sailor’s inns where the inshore fleets bring their catch ashore at dawn.

(3) **[[Aesganstrad]]** is the ancient core of Tollen, a tangle of narrow streets, leaning houses, and strange old statues to forgotten heroes. 

(4) **[[Magus Street]]** is the university district, crowded with bookshops, lecture halls, boarding houses, and student taverns spilling arguments and minor magic into the lanes.

(5) **[[Nordgate]]** is the dwarven-leaning craft ward around the old north gate, full of stone-fronted workshops and forges.

(6) **[[Bridgeward]]** is the market front of the [[Tollen Bridge]], where carts, stalls, and shops cluster around market squares. 

(7) **[[Southbridge]]** is the south-bank bridge ward, where exclusive magical tattoo parlors coexist with small dyers, cheap lodgings, and street artists.

(8) **[[Godshome]]** is the temple district, its streets winding between crowded shrines, great houses of the Eight Divines, the [[Temple of Kaikkea]], and smaller, stranger faiths.

(9) **[[Guildgate]]** is the hill of guildhalls and merchant houses, where rich guilds keep their meeting rooms, gardens, and courts and send delegates to the Great Council.

(10) **[[Gold Street]]** is the main commercial avenue of Tollen, a district of broad streets, counting-houses, and moneylenders where large deals are struck and recorded.

(11) **[[Fairgate]]**, split into [[Fairgate Inner]] and [[Fairgate Outer]] is the western gate district, a mix of markets, caravan inns, and halfling homes linked to the [[Fairgrounds (Tollen)|Fairgrounds]] and the farms of [[Fairgate Outer]].

(12) **[[Haurhill]]** is the rise above the [[Little River]], built around the remains of an old Drankorian fort.

(13) **[[Battery]]** is the fortified south-bank ward at the harbor mouth, home to naval yards, shipbuilding slips, and large fish-processing sheds.

(14) **[[Brooklawn]]**, split into [[Brooklawn Inner]] and [[Brooklawn Outer]], is the tanners’ and dyers’ district along the Little River, packed with vats, canals, smokehouses, and workshops that turn hides and cloth into Tollish trade goods.

(15) **[[Riversgate]]** is the upriver barge and timber ward, where rafts of logs, grain barges, and other river cargo tie up at low quays and feed the city’s warehouses.

(16) **[[Fenslane]]** is a south-bank ward on reclaimed marsh, with plank-walked lanes, modest houses, and workshops for the dockworkers and families who live near the river.

(17) **[[Tideswell]]** is the outer south-bank waterfront, a poorer strip of shacks, stilt-houses, fish sheds, and small yards, prone to flooding at high tide.
