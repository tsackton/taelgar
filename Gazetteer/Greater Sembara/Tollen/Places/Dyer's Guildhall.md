The Dyer’s Guildhall is among the more elaborate buildings in [[Guildgate]], a richly colored piazza‑front palace where the masters of the [[Dyer's Guild]] hold court. Its facade looks out over a stone‑paved square, with arcades and balconies often hung with bolts of brilliant color, a permanent advertisement for the famous [[Tollen Dyes|Tollen Red]] and the wealth of the guild.

During [[Pyravela]], the Dyer’s Guildhall hosts one of the most coveted celebrations in the city—a riot of color, music, and food where priests of the Wyrdling mingle with merchants, nobles, and visiting artists, and where the first fireworks of the festival traditionally flare above Guildgate.
