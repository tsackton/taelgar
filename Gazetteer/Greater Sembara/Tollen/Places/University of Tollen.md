# The University of Tollen

The University of Tollen is a cluster of faculties and halls along [[Magus Street]] in [[Tollen]]. It is a magnet for scholars and dramatists from across the Western Green Sea. 

The University supports faculties in rhetoric, natural philosophy, history, magic, and metaphysics, among others, with a particular emphasis on literary arts. Debates spill from lecture halls into taverns, student troupes stage plays that sometimes mock their own professors, and illusionists host shows of wonder in the courtyards of the University.

Not canon: Many of the buildings now occupied by the University were originally constructed as libraries and collegium during the [[Drankorian Era]], but the University itself has only been in continuous operation since the growth of Tollen as a mercantile power after the fall of Drankor. 

Another idea: much of the university was built on the ruins of the old eastern river fort
