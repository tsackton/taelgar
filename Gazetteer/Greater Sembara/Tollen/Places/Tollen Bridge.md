# The Tollen Bridge

The [[Tollen Bridge]] is a broad stone span of many arches, built around the time the [[Drankorian Empire]] first raised stone walls around [[Tollen]].

Its piers choke the [[Volta]] into narrow, dangerous channels, forming a hard barrier to navigation: tall‑masted oceanic ships cannot pass beyond the bridge, and must moor at the sea‑port below its shadow, while low‑masted barges and river craft carry cargo upriver beneath the central arches.

The bridge is also a major commercial hub, lined with shops, houses, and stalls, and serves as a key defensive work, with gatehouses at either end controlling road traffic; and small lifting section at the north end that can be raised if needed for defense.
