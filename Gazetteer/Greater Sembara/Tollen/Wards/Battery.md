A ward of Tollen located on the south bank of the [[Volta]], across from [[Skepwalk]]. Battery extends the furthest downriver of any ward of the city. A great series of fortifications were constructed here during the years before the [[Great War]], which still guard the river approaches. Though not densely populated, as trade has grown in recent years a number of commercial docks and warehouses have been built in this area.

should be a little swampy, not particularly pleasant - it is near the marshes at the confluence of the Greywash after all. but there is a lot of space here, and minimal space in Skepwalk / Fiskurth, so new docks and trade capacity tend to end up here. 
it also has the advantage of easier overland access to the southern roads, since goods are not bottlenecked by the Tollen Bridge - so it is likely that a lot of transshiped goods get unloaded here, whereas things for sale in Tollen, or for use in Tollender industry, still prefer Skepwalk
