Brooklawn Inner is the low-lying ward inside the western walls of [[Tollen]], where the [[Little River]] has been straightened into a stone-lined channel. It is a cramped, workaday district of smaller tanneries, dye-sheds, and leather workshops, mixed with cheap lodging houses and crowded courts for the laborers who work along the river. The worst of the vats lie beyond [[Tanner's Gate (Tollen)|Tanner’s Gate]] in [[Brooklawn Outer]], but the air in Brooklawn Inner still carries a permanent tang of smoke, bark, and lime. Because the ground here floods in heavy rains, many buildings stand on raised footings or short piers, and lanes twist around old drainage ditches and culverts.
