Magus Street lies on the eastern edge of the city, on high ground above the river, home to the [[University of Tollen]]. Its streets are lined with bookshops, coffee hours, and copying offices; students and tutors occupy narrow flats above. Here, broad streets lined with shops mix with tiny warrens of twisting alleys full of drunk students, buskers, and noise. There is very little open space here; lecture halls and crowds of students suddenly appear around a narrow corner.
