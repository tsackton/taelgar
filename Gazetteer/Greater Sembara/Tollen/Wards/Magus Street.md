%% 

Magnus Street takes its name from the concentration of magi and learned folk. Bookshops, coffee houses, and copying offices crowd its length; students and tutors share narrow flats above.

Broad streets lined with shops trade with tiny warrens of twisting alleys full of drunk students, buskers, and noise. Very little open space - you stumble upon lecture halls and crowded dorms almost out of the blue.
