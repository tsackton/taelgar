An ancient district in [[Tollen]] and part of the original Skaer city, Fiskurth is a dense warren of narrow, bustling streets along the north-bank waterfront, filled with overhanging wooden buildings. It is now the heart of the fishing trade, crowded with fish markets, sailor’s inns, and the low docks where the inshore fleets unload their catch. Fiskurth is loud, smelly, and full of activity -- beggars, hawkers, horsecarts of rich merchants, peddlers on packhorses selling water, throngs of people. 


%% DM notes
vibe is narrow warrens, sailor's inns, smelly fish markets, loud, bustle; generally smaller docks, fewer warehouses, and more activity 

Ancient: some roads are paved with Drankorian stone which is still smooth after so many years, and there are odd things like the occasional small square with an ancient statue to a forgotten Skaer or mariner hero.
