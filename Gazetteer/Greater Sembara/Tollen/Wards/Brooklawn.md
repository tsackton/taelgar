# Brooklawn

Brooklawn is a ward of [[Tollen]] that spreads across both sides of the [[Little River]]. This area is swampy and prone to flooding, with a long history of industrial use for tanning, leather-working, and dye-works. 

For most of the city's history, Brooklawn stood outside the walls, and was a separate suburb, protected in Drankorian times by the fort on [[Haurhill]]. When the walls were expanded west in the years after the [[Great War]], the old suburb of Brooklawn was split into [[Brooklawn Inner]] and [[Brooklawn Outer]]. 

The [[Little River]] now runs in a stone-lined channel through [[Brooklawn Inner]].
