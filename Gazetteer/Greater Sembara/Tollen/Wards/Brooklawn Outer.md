Brooklawn Outer is the out‑wall district northwest of [[Haurhill]] in [[Tollen]], known for tanneries and leatherworks along the [[Little River]]. The air is acrid on certain winds, and workshops cluster near sluices and pits. Poorer tenements and sheds line the lanes leading back toward [[Tanner's Gate (Tollen)|Tanner's Gate]], which divides [[Brooklawn Inner]] and [[Brooklawn Outer]].

The [[Little River]] marks the edge between [[Brooklawn Outer]] and [[Fairgate Outer]], where the smells of bark and urine from the vats give way to the fields and gardens.
