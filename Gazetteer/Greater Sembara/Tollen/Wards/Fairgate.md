# Fairgate

Fairgate is one of Tollen’s western approaches, divided today into [[Fairgate Inner]] (within the walls) and [[Fairgate Outer]] (beyond them). 

Fairgate was established as a ward of Tollen when the walls were expanded west to enclose the ancient fort on [[Haurhill]]. At the time, open fields lay to the north, which was kept as a space for markets. Over time, as the [[Fairgrounds (Tollen)|Fairgrounds]] were established by halfling caravans, village-like sprawl grew up outside the walls, forming [[Fairgate Outer]], with the original Fairgate ward renamed [[Fairgate Inner]].

unlike Brooklawn or Riversgate, where an existing suburb was bisected by the new wall, Fairgate Outer grew up post-wall, making Fairgate Inner substantially older than Fairgate Outer
