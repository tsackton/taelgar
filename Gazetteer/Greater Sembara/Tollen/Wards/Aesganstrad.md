# Aesganstrad

One of the ancient original wards of the city of [[Tollen]]. 

%% DM Notes
Name derives from Aesgan, a semi-mythical Skaegish hero who is said to have protected/resettled Tollen after the Downfall. Who or what Aesgan was is not canonical, but their existence in some form, at least in myth, is canonical. E.g. Aesgan could have been an elf or a dragon and later became associated with the Skaer, but should have a real existence of some kind. 

Best preserved of the ancient districts. Likely some landmarks or other features that date to before the Downfall. 

Dunmar campaign never went to this district, except maybe as part of an un-narrated walk to some other destination.
