Nordgate is a historic district of [[Tollen]], clustered around the original north gate of the city, first extensively developed during the [[Drankorian Era]], when the first stone walls around Tollen were constructed. In the modern era it is known as a center of dwarven life, with stonecutters, smiths, and inns catering to travelers, especially dwarves from near and far. 

In Nordgate, workshops line narrow courtyards; beer‑cellars and stone‑fronted taverns serve hearty fare. Many buildings incorporate older Drankorian foundations, giving Nordgate a layered look of brick and timber over dressed stone.

Nordgate lies east of [[Bridgeward]] and north of the approaches to [[Godshome]], with steady foot traffic between them. In this section of the city, the original stone walls, repaired and rebuilt many times, still stand, and the [[North Gate (Tollen)|North Gate]] is one of the oldest still-extant gates of [[Tollen]].

DM notes
- District summary aligns with [[Tollen|Tollen.md]] notes: dwarven concentration, proximity to [[Aesganstrad]]/Bridgeward. Good space for guild politics and dwarf‑human ties.
