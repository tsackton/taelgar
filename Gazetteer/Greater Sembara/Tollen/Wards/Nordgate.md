Nordgate is a historic district of [[Tollen]], north of [[Bridgeward]] and clustered around the original north gate of the city, first extensively developed during the [[Drankorian Era]], when the first stone walls around Tollen were constructed. In the modern era it is known as a center of dwarven life, with stonecutters, smiths, and inns catering to travelers, especially dwarves from near and far. Many buildings incorporate older Drankorian foundations, giving Nordgate a layered look of brick and timber over dressed stone.
