# Southbridge

Southbridge is the oldest and most prosperous ward on the south bank of the [[Volta]], across the river from [[Bridgeward]], spreading from the south end of the [[Tollen Bridge]]. Though once swampy ground, this area was drained and reclaimed in Drankorian times; the ancient Drankorian road south meets the [[Tollen Bridge]] here. 

Southbridge is the center of the Tollen tattoo industry, with many of the most prosperous and skilled tattoo artists, especially those who incorporate magical ink into their work, located along [[Inkspell Lane]].

Downriver of the [[Tollen Bridge]], Southbridge is also part of the sea-port: deepwater ships can moor on the south bank here, while ferries and lighters carry people and cargo across to the busier quays of the north bank.
