Southbridge is the oldest and most prosperous ward on the south bank of the [[Volta]], across the river from [[Bridgeward]], spreading from the south end of the [[Tollen Bridge]]. Though once swampy ground, this area was drained and reclaimed in Drankorian times; the ancient Drankorian road south meets the [[Tollen Bridge]] here. Downriver of the [[Tollen Bridge]], Southbridge is also part of the sea-port, though it sees less deepwater traffic and has a less developed waterfront than [[Battery]]. 

Southbridge is the center of the Tollen tattoo industry, with many of the most prosperous and skilled tattoo artists, especially those who incorporate magical ink into their work, located along [[Inkspell Lane]].
