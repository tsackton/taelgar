# Haurhill

Haurhill is a ward of [[Tollen]] built on the low rise west of the old city, overlooking the course of the [[Little River]]. This height of land was once the site of a Drankorian fort guarding the western approach and the Brooklawn suburbs, though the fort no longer stands intact. Narrow lanes climb the hill from [[Brooklawn Inner]] and [[Fairgate Inner]].
