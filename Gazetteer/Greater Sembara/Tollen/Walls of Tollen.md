# The Walls of Tollen

Tollen has been protected by walls for many centuries, beginning with a wooden palisade that guarded the ancient city during the Skaer era. 

The Drankorians built a stone wall, the [[Tollen Bridge]], and two forts -- one upriver, on what is now [[Haurhill]], and the other downriver, in what is now [[Magus Street]]. Three of the city gates survive from these ancient walls: Old Gate, Scholar's Gate, and North Gate.

In the long years of Tollen's growth as a free city, the walls were expanded twice. The first expansion was smaller, and enclosed the old downriver fort (creating a new gate, Fort Gate, where the fort once stood) as well as expanding north from Bridgeward, enclosing Godshome and creating the Temple Gate. The second expansion pushed the walls west, stretching to Haurhill; this expansion created the current day gates of Guild Gate, Fair Gate, and Tanner's Gate. 

Recently, Tollen has expanded the walls again on the western edge of the city, enclosing [[Brooklawn Inner]] and [[Riversgate Inner]] and creating two new gates: River Gate, where the Little River enters the city, and West Gate, the further upriver.
