# Brooklawn Outer
Brooklawn Outer is the out‑wall district west of [[Haurhill]] in [[Tollen]], known for tanneries and leatherworks along the [[Little River]]. The air is acrid on certain winds, and workshops cluster near sluices and pits. Poorer tenements and sheds line the lanes leading back toward [[Tanner's Gate]], which divides Brooklawn Inner and Outer.

## Character and Work
Hides arrive from upriver droves and are cured, scraped, and dyed here before moving to cobblers and armorers in other wards. The district’s craftsmen are practical and close‑knit; guild oversight focuses on waste‑handling and fire safety.

## Boundaries
The Little River marks the edge between Brooklawn Outer and [[Fairgate Outer]], where the smells of bark and urine from the vats give way to the fields and gardens.
