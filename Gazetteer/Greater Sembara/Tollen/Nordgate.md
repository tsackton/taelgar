# Nordgate
Nordgate is a historic district of [[Tollen]] clustered around the original north gate of the city. In the modern era it is known as a center of dwarven life, with stonecutters, smiths, and inns catering to travelers from the [[Sentinel Range]].

## Character and Streets
Workshops line narrow courtyards; beer‑cellars and stone‑fronted taverns serve hearty fare. Many buildings incorporate older Drankorian foundations, giving Nordgate a layered look of brick over dressed stone.

## Neighbors
Nordgate lies east of [[Bridgeward]] and north of the approaches to [[Godshome]], with steady foot traffic between them.

DM notes
- District summary aligns with [[Tollen|Tollen.md]] notes: dwarven concentration, proximity to Aesganstrad/Bridgeward. Good space for guild politics and dwarf‑human ties.
