*A note about "Inner" and "Outer" wards:*

Riversgate, Fairgate, and Brooklawn are split into "Inner" (inside the walls) and "Outer" (outside the walls). Riversgate and Brooklawn were divided when the walls were expanded west; Fairgate Outer grew up around the [[Fairgrounds (Tollen)]] north of the city. The boundaries of Outer wards are approximate. 

The northern wards (Guildgate, Godshome, Nordgate) and eastern wards (Magnus Street, Skepwalk) are not split into "Inner" and "Outer". There is little settlement beyond the eastern walls, because of the marshes. The best farmland in the Tollen area is along the banks of the Carnbrook, so north of the northern wards is mostly fields; the small villages in this direction have not been incorporated into the city.

Lighter brown areas are low rises or small hills, the most significant of which is in Haurhill, to the west.
