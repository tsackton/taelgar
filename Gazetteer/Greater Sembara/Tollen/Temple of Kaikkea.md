# The Temple of Kaikkea

An ancient building in [[Godshome]] in [[Tollen]], built by the original [[Skaer]] settlers of this region long ago. The temple remains a highly sacred place to the Skaer, and a priest always serves to make sure that [[Kaikkea]] can still be heard here. This is also the center of the small Skaer community in [[Tollen]].

The temple is a striking circular building of brilliant white marble shaped like undulating wave.
