# Fair Gate
Fair Gate is one of the principal gates in the walls of [[Tollen]], opening toward the halflingâ€‘favored districts of [[Fairgate]] and the fields and gardens beyond. Traders from the western roads and farm carts bound for the city use this approach, making the gate a lively checkpoint most mornings.

## Construction and Traffic
Thick stone towers flank the arch, with a portcullis and reinforced doors. City wardens regulate movement at market times; a cluster of inns and weighhouses just inside the walls caters to arrivals.
