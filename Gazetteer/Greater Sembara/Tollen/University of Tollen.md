%% lots of notes from DM notes to incorporate %%

The University of Tollen is the principal center of learning in western Sembara, a collegium of faculties and halls clustered along [[Magnus Street]] near [[Godshome]]. Founded in the late Drankorian era as mercantile fortunes grew, it has since become a magnet for scholars, dramatists, and engineers from across the Green Sea ports.

## Faculties and Culture
The University supports faculties in rhetoric, natural philosophy, history, metaphysics, and applied craft. Debates spill from lecture halls into taverns, and student troupes stage plays that sometimes mock their own professors. A tradition of patronage ties certain halls to wealthy guilds and merchant houses.

## Notable Associations
- The Faculty of Metaphysics is known for sharp critiques of speculative cosmology, though dissenting scholars occasionally rise to prominence.
- University life overlaps with the Dyers’, Scribers’, and Architects’ guilds, and with the great temple quarter of [[Godshome]].

## District
Magnus Street takes its name from the concentration of magi and learned folk. Bookshops, coffee houses, and copying offices crowd its length; students and tutors share narrow flats above.
