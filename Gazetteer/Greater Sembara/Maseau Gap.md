%% check/mike: typeOf, basic overview, naming history %%

The Maseau Gap is a broad saddle between the [[Mostreve Hills]] and the [[~Sentinel Range Spur~]], providing one of the few practical north-south corridors between the realms of [[Greater Sembara]] and the south. This is a flat, open land, dominated by plains and scrubland. The [[Great South Road]], constructed in the ancient days of the [[Drankorian Empire]] and still in nearly perfect repair, is the primary route through the Gap. 

## Names
During the Drankorian Empire, this was referred to as the Val Masseum, the "valley beneath the mountains".
