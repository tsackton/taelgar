The below is a start, but needs collation with a bunch of discussions on discord, in email, etc as part of the planning around both [[Isingue]] and my Ausson's mini series
#### The Refounded Alliance of Aurbez

- Founded by two groups -- a core of refugees from the collapse of Insingue who hid out in the hills during the blood years, and developed a bit of a guerilla culture also supported the rangers a fair bit, second a group of folks who settled in Maseau or even the western marches for a bit, but were attracted by the growing rumors of an InsinguenÂ  culture / group
    
- These people explicitly call back to Insingue as kinda their founding ideal / lost homeland
    
- Welcoming to travelers but very protective of their prerogative to the land, conceptually believe they have a claim to any habitable parts of the plaguelands, fiercely independent
    
- Rebuilding not foreign affairs is real goal, but claims to be the heirs of Insignue and claims sovereignty over all the lands south of Maseau and north of Insingue
    
- Major settlements are along the Aursen, along the Dunmar Road, in the foothills and valleys of the Douren, and in the high elevations from the source of the Aursen to the source of the Mansance
