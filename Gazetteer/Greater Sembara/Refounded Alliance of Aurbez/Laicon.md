A small village that has grew up around [[Ausson's Crossing]], a large inn, in the late 1690s. [[Ausson's Crossing]] is still the dominate building and still the heart and soul of the village. It is set across the [[Maseau - Dunmar Road]] and has become an important trading point for [[Aurbez Plateau]] scavengers who reclaim dwarven mining goods and ore from the ruins and dangers of [[Ardith]] and sell it to the outside world.

%% See [[Ardith Mining]] for some background on this. Also note the details in the [[Ausson's Crossing]] page.  %%
