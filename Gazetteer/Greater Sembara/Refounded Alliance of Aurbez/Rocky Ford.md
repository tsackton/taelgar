Rocky Ford, movable town springs up around the ford of the Masance
see [[The Travelogue of Etienne of Cassons]] for a few details

general idea is that the village is recreated each spring where the best fording spot is on the masance, which moves each season; PCs came here in Ausson's game but the details are mostly lost to time as I didn't write them down

The vibe was frontier town/rough justice/slightly crooked place with a "river boss" who controlled the crossing and basically ran the town. could have changed some since the 1680s but should still be a moveable camp more than a real town
