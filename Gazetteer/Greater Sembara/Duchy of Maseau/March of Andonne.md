%% should be reviewed in light of more recent inventions is old ... %%
This area, south of the Duchy of Maseau, has no formal rulers or organized political structures, although treaties on paper define it as under the suzerintity of the Duke of Maseau as far south as the the Andonne river. In practice most of the marcher lords establish fortified ranches in the central plains or along the Dunmar Road, where the ash storms are less intense. Cattle and goats are the main livelihood, as crops die too often in the ashy summers. Cattle can be brought inside the great fortified ranches when troubles come from the east and the marcher lords ride out to earn their stipends. The ranches along the Dunmar Road have grown into fortified rest-stops and places of refuge for travelers, and one does not need to camp in the open between Cassons and the crossing of the Masance. This is a land of scrubby grasses and small dryland trees.

%% Notes

-   The borderlands in 1750, a mostly empty stretch between the Mansance to the west, the Andonne to the south, Maseau to the north, and the forests of Addermarch to the east
    
-   A zone of largely independent lords, backed by Sembaran wealth - anyone who can raise some folk and is willing to help staff a castle basically gets a generous stipend and to be a lord
    
-   Most castles and towns are in the north, along the Dunmar Road, or along the western stretches of the Andonne
    
-   The Andonne as it flows east gets ash-choked and polluted, and by the time it reaches Lake Aeurlian is it gray-brown and inhospitable to life
