The northernmost settlement in [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] along the Great South Road. Evis is a fortified frontier town on the border of the March of Evis, ruled by the aging Marcher Lord, [[Peyre Vayler]], and his two daughters.  South of Evis, the land turns more fertile, and more populated, before eventually reaching the rolling valleys near [[Valarin]], where most of the people of the Duchy of Maseau live.
