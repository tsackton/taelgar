The main town in southern [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] is the border fort of Cassons. Once an important town on the road from [[Isingue]] to [[Embry]], it is a shadow of its former self and is dotted with ruins and abandoned buildings. It is a dry and dusty place, just far enough south to get choking ash storms in the summer, and the people eke out a meager living on the proceeds from trade along the Dunmar Road and food shipments from [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], designed to encourage a defense here. In the hinterlands of Cassons a small number of ranchers have established themselves along the ruins of the [[Great South Road]], and the forts of the Marcher Lords dot the ranchlands or several days' ride south.
