A large area of swampy lowlands centered around the confluence of the [[Wistel]] and the [[Enst]], which is home to a substantial [[Lizardfolk]] population. 

The Ozabal is the remnants, along with the [[Latazaro]] swamp, of the [[~Ancient Lizardfolk Swamp~|vast wetlands]] that once covered much of the Sembaran lowlands, before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]].
