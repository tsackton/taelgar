%% notes 
Geologically, the Mostreve HIlls are the dominant feature. They are basically the western foothills / extension of the Orenlas Border Mountains, and run along the southern border of Tyrwingha, and then through Addermarch before stopping at the Gap of Maseau. 

I am envisioning the Mostreve as basically consisting of four sections:

- The easternmost section, not really marked on the world map, is the transition zone south of Ozebal Swamp. Here you probably have fairly mountainous "hills" that drop quickly to a flat coastal plain. A possible analog might be something like southern France, specifically the Camargue standing in for Ozebal (albeit a bit colder). The mountains here are a significant barrier to travel and are largely uninhabited, and probably never were really settled particularly densely, although pre-Great War possibly Tyrwingha <-> Orenlas trade exists, or perhaps Obezal <-> Orenlas trade. 
- Moving west, to the area immediately south of Tyrwingha, you have gentler hills, with more settlement particularly on the northern slopes, but still a notable barrier to travel even in the pre-Plaguelands days. The vibe to me here feels kind of Appalachian, perhaps, maybe something like Blue Hills. But in this section you still have a prominent ridge running east/west that is a major barrier to travel and makes for a natural border.
- Moving west, to Addermarch, things break down a little. Here you don't have a strong ridge line, you have rolling hills amidst river valleys. I think still a kind of Appalachian vibe, but here you have a mix of lower rolling hills and more settlement. I think all of Addermarch is probably fairly hilly overall. Even pre-Great-War, the Darkwood is a dangerous / haunted place and not something you travel through, so even though the terrain is less forboding to the south, it is not like there is a major trade road to Isingue here. But there is probably not no traffic, and Addermarch gets some Isingue influence probably. 
- At the western edge of the Mostreve Hills, you have a sharp escarpment that sweeps in a gentle north/south curve, running south of the [[Clavert River]] and then turning south and east to the [[Valmont]]. Directly west of this escarpment you have the Maseau Gap, which is a flat plain, and then the Sentinels Spur further west. North, in the modern day borderlands, I can imagine the "Addermarch hill country" extends a bit east of the Clavert and west of the [[Aure]]
