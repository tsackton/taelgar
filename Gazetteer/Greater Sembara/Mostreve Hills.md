The Mostreve Hills are a stretch of rough, rocky hills, with some higher peaks, that run in a series of long ridges from the flat plains of the [[Maseau Gap]] to the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]], dividing [[Sembara]], [[Addermarch]], and [[Tyrwingha]] from the [[Plaguelands]]. They are largely wooded, although some of the highest peaks are above treeline, and the drier southwestern sides of some ridges are high plains with only scattered trees. The climate is temperate, with warm summers, cool winters, and frequent precipitation year round, with occasional winter snowfall on the higher peaks.

Geographically, the Mostreve Hills are composed of five distinct ridgelines:
* The [[Westcliff]] ridge is a sharp escarpment that runs in a truncated north-south 'C', on the western edge of the Mostreve Hills. The western edge of [[Westcliff]] is particularly steep, forming a dramatic cliff line against the flat [[Maseau Gap]]. The northern edge of the escarpment, in contrast, forms a series of tumbled, broken ridges that blend into the [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]]. The [[Clavert]], to the north, and the [[Valmont]], to the south, both have their sources in [[Westcliff]]. The highest peaks of the Mostreve Hills are here, especially along the western escarpment. 
* The ~Aure Headwaters Ridge~ runs mostly east-west, arising from the rolling hills of the [[Aure]] river valley some 50 miles east of the [[Westcliff]] ridge, and cutting in a south-south-easterly line towards the ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~. This ridgeline partially separates [[Addermarch]] from the [[Darkwood]]. 
* The ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~, which runs in a north-easterly line from the ~Aure Headwaters Ridge~ towards [[Tyrwingha]]
* The ~North Tyrwinghan Ridge~ which is east of the Aure, and runs in a series of lines running north-west from the Tyrwinghan ridge. These peaks are notably gentler than the other ridges, and form less of a barrier to travel.
* The ~Orlenas Ridge~, which starts south of the [[Latazaro]] swamp and runs almost due east until it grows in the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]]

In between these ridgelines are several major gaps:
* The [[Aure]] river cuts between the [[Westcliff]] and Tyrwinghan ridges, in a broad and relatively fertile river valley
* The Darkwood creeps north between the [[Westcliff]] ridge and the ~Aure Headwaters Ridge~, forming a hilly wildland on the southern borders of [[Addermarch]]
* Between the ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~ and the ~Orlenas Ridge~ the land is hilly but there are few high ridgelines, and multiple passes cut through the Mostreve HIlls immediately northwest of [[Orenlas]]. 

The Mostreve Hills, then, can be divided into a number of major regions based on these features:
* The [[Westcliff]] Ridge and associated hills
* The western Aure river valley, where the hills are gentler and rolling and typically wooded except where cleared for pasture and orchards. This is a land of rushing river valleys broken by rugged, hilly forests, but with few truly high peaks. 
* The eastern Aure river valley and nearby foothills, between the ~Aure Headwaters Ridge~ and the ~Tyrwinghan Ridge~, where the soil is poorer and the land is  grasslands mixed with rocky outcroppings
* The Darkwood itself, between the [[Westcliff]] and ~Aure Headwaters Ridge~, and stretching south beyond the reach of the Mostreve Hills
* The Tyrwinghan foothills, between the Tyrwinghan Ridge and the North Tyrwinghan Ridge, a land of rolling forested hills
* The Tyrwinghan highlands, along the Tyrwinghan Ridge and where it mets the Aure Headwaters Ridge, a land of high occasionally snowcapped peaks and difficult to pass valleys

The basic layout of the Mostreve Hills:

(W) to the west, is the Westcliff. These are some of the tallest mountains in the region, especially the areas marked 1 and 2. The area marked 2 has a dramatic cliff edge falling down to the gap to the west. The southeastern part of "W" is all forested and much more gentle hills. Just northeast of the "W" on the swamp tree icon is the Shadowmere, a fey/haunted/scary lowland basin/swamp. Might have no outflows, or only have outflows to the Feywild. Might be the source of minor rivers flowing northeast. The part of "W" that is just east of "2" is where the Addermarch campaign is mostly set. This is high scrubland / moors separately from the river valleys by a forest. The northern curve to the east is canonically not as steep and difficult as the areas marked 1/2; this trends into the borderlands. 

(A) in the south/central is the Aure Headwaters Ridge. Very little is developed about this, except that this is where most of the Addermarch fortifications would be. Generally the Plaguelands slopes are forested; the northern slopes might have scattered forests but have poor, sandy soils and likely cannot support dense forests. The inner circle marked "1" is the steepest region; rest is probably fairly gentle hills; this ridgeline is much less steep and high than "W" or "T"

(T) is the Tyrwinghan Ridge. This is steepest and highest in the inner circle, with sharper/harder slopes on the southwestern side towards Addermarch and gentler slopes on the Tyrwinghan side. The border stones presumably follow a line along this ridge running northwest/southeast, roughly orange line, although whether they extend southwest past the "T" is actually not obvious to me. Sunset gate follows the river immediately southwest of the "1" in the "A" circle. 

(NT) is the North Tyrwinghan ridge, which is really one geographic feature with (T). The terrain gradually slopes to gentler hills as you go further north, until it meets the Enst valley. 

(O) is the Orenlas ridge. No invention here, although my feeling is the map is basically correct that the area marked "1" is steepest; "2" is next, and the center section around the "O" is probably not that steep.
