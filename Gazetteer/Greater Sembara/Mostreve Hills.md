The Mostreve Hills are a stretch of rough, rocky hills, with some higher peaks, that run in a series of long ridges from the flat plains of the [[Maseau Gap]] to the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]], dividing [[Sembara]], [[Addermarch]], and [[Tyrwingha]] from the [[Plaguelands]]. They are largely wooded, although some of the highest peaks are above treeline, and the drier southwestern sides of some ridges are high plains with only scattered trees. The climate is temperate, with warm summers, cool winters, and frequent precipitation year round, with occasional winter snowfall on the higher peaks.

Geographically, the Mostreve Hills are composed of four distinct ridges: two mountainous ridges running roughly north-south, and two gentler ridgelines of rolling hills running roughly east-west. 

The two north-south mountainous ridges are:

* The [[Westcliff]] ridge is a sharp escarpment that runs in a truncated north-south 'C', on the western edge of the Mostreve Hills. The western edge of [[Westcliff]] is particularly steep, forming a dramatic cliff line against the flat [[Maseau Gap]]. The northern edge of the escarpment, in contrast, forms a series of tumbled, broken ridges that blend into the [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]]. The [[Clavert]], to the north, and the [[Valmont]], to the south, both have their sources in [[Westcliff]]. The some of the highest peaks of the Mostreve Hills are here, especially along the western escarpment, where winter snows are frequent.

* The [[Maerwyn Mountains]] are a line of higher peaks that run in a north-easterly line along the border between [[Addermarch]] and [[Tyrwingha]], roughly from the [[Valenfray Hills]] to the [[Enst]] river valley. These mountains are highest in the south, near and north of the sources of the [[Branth]], and gradually slope to a gentler series of rough hills towards the [[Enst]]. 

The east-west hills are:

* The [[Valenfray Hills]] form a line of gentle rolling hills that run in a broken east-west line, from roughly the [[Aure]] to where they meet the [[Maerwyn Mountains]].  This ridgeline partially separates [[Addermarch]] from the [[Darkwood]]. The westerly parts of these hills are typically gentle, rolling hills with light forests, and are settled by foresters and others. As they ascend to meet the Maerwyns, the terrain grows rougher, with many sharp ravines, making travel challenging. These hills have been extensively fortified over many years by [[Addermarch]] to guard its southern borders from the [[Plaguelands]] and the [[Darkwood]]. 

- The ~Tyrwinghan Hills~ form a line of hills and valleys running roughly east-west from the [[Maerwyn Mountains|Maerwyns]] to the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]].  

In between these ridge lines are several major gaps:
* The [[Aure]] river flows north between the eastern edge of the [[Westcliff]] and the western edge of the [[Maerwyn Mountains]], forming a broad and fertile river valley fed by many small streams. 
* The Darkwood creeps north between the [[Westcliff]] ridge and the [[Valenfray Hills]], forming a hilly wildland on the southern borders of [[Addermarch]]. The [[Shadowmere]], a low-lying swampy depression, sits in this gap. 
* Between the [[Maerwyn Mountains]] and the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]], the land is hilly but there are few high ridgelines, and multiple passes cut through the ~Tyrwinghan Hills~ immediately northwest of [[Orenlas]]. 

The Mostreve Hills, then, can be divided into a number of overall regions based on these features:
* The [[Westcliff]] Ridge and associated hills
* The western Aure river valley, where the hills are gentler and rolling and typically wooded except where cleared for pasture and orchards. This is a land of rushing river valleys broken by rugged, hilly forests, but with few truly high peaks. 
* The eastern Aure river valley and nearby foothills, between the [[Valenfray Hills]] and the [[Maerwyn Mountains]], where the soil is poorer and the land is  grasslands mixed with rocky outcroppings
* The [[Darkwood]] itself, between the [[Westcliff]] and [[Valenfray Hills]], and stretching south beyond the reach of the Mostreve Hills
* The Tyrwinghan foothills, between [[Maerwyn Mountains|Maerwyns]] and the ~Tyrwinghan Hiills~, a land of rolling forested hills
* The Tyrwinghan highlands, along the eastern side of the [[Maerwyn Mountains|Maerwyns]], a land of high occasionally snowcapped peaks and difficult to pass valleys

The basic layout of the Mostreve Hills:

(W) to the west, is the Westcliff. These are some of the tallest mountains in the region, especially the areas marked 1 and 2. The area marked 2 has a dramatic cliff edge falling down to the gap to the west. The southeastern part of "W" is all forested and much more gentle hills. Just northeast of the "W" on the swamp tree icon is the Shadowmere, a fey/haunted/scary lowland basin/swamp. Might have no outflows, or only have outflows to the Feywild. Might be the source of minor rivers flowing northeast. The part of "W" that is just east of "2" is where the Addermarch campaign is mostly set. This is high scrubland / moors separately from the river valleys by a forest. The northern curve to the east is canonically not as steep and difficult as the areas marked 1/2; this trends into the borderlands. 

(A) in the south/central is the Aure Headwaters Ridge. Very little is developed about this, except that this is where most of the Addermarch fortifications would be. Generally the Plaguelands slopes are forested; the northern slopes might have scattered forests but have poor, sandy soils and likely cannot support dense forests. The inner circle marked "1" is the steepest region; rest is probably fairly gentle hills; this ridgeline is much less steep and high than "W" or "T" (although actually the "1" here is really maybe better considered part of a north-south ridgeline that joins T and NT). 

(T) is the Tyrwinghan Ridge. This is steepest and highest in the inner circle, with sharper/harder slopes on the southwestern side towards Addermarch and gentler slopes on the Tyrwinghan side. The border stones presumably follow a line along this ridge running northwest/southeast, roughly orange line, although whether they extend southwest past the "T" is actually not obvious to me. Sunset gate follows the river immediately southwest of the "1" in the "A" circle. 

(NT) is the North Tyrwinghan ridge, which is really one geographic feature with (T). The terrain gradually slopes to gentler hills as you go further north, until it meets the Enst valley. 

(O) is the Orenlas ridge. No invention here, although my feeling is the map is basically correct that the area marked "1" is steepest; "2" is next, and the center section around the "O" is probably not that steep.
