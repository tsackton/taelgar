The Mostreve Hills are a stretch of rough, rocky hills, with some higher peaks, that run in a series of long ridges from the flat plains of the [[Maseau Gap]] to the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]], dividing [[Sembara]], [[Addermarch]], and [[Tyrwingha]] from the [[Plaguelands]]. They are largely wooded, although some of the highest peaks are above treeline, and the drier southwestern sides of some ridges are high plains with only scattered trees. The climate is temperate, with warm summers, cool winters, and frequent precipitation year round, with occasional winter snowfall on the higher peaks.

Geographically, the Mostreve Hills are composed of four distinct regions:
- The western edge of the Mostreve Hills is a sharp escarpment, known locally in Addermarch as the [[Westcliff]], that runs in a broad arc capping the northwestern, western, and southwestern edges of the Mostreve Hills. The western edge of Westcliff is particularly steep, forming a dramatic cliff line against the flat [[Maseau Gap]]. The northern edge of the escarpment, in contrast, forms a series of tumbled, broken ridges that blend into the [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]]. The [[Clavert]], to the north, and the [[Valmont]], to the south, both have their sources in [[Westcliff]]. 
- East of [[Westcliff]], the [[Aure]] river valley breaks up the ridge lines of the [[Mostreve Hills]], forming a great bowl. Here, the hills are gentler, rolling hills, wooded except where cleared for pasture and orchards. This is a land of rushing river valleys broken by rugged, hilly forests, but with few truly high peaks. 
- East of the [[Aure]], the highest mountains of the Mostreve HIlls lie along the northern edge of what is now the Plaguelands. Here, especially on the southwestern slopes, the poor soil creates a land of grasslands mixed with rocky outcroppings, sloping to the [[~Aure East Fork~]] valley. These high peaks gradually slope down in gentle ridges to the northwest, becoming the wooded hills of [[Tyrwingha]]. 
- East of [[Tyrwingha]], and north of the [[Ozabal|Ozabal Swamp]], the Mostreve Hills merge with the foothills of the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]], with the rough, jagged hills dropping quickly to the flat coastal plains. Although there are some high peaks here, the long east-west ridge lines from further west break down here, and multiple passes cut through the Mostreve HIlls immediately northwest of [[Orenlas]].
