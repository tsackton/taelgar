%% Tim:  for names and meta %%
A swift-flowing, largely unnavigable river in the north of the Sembara. The Teft flows from the central foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], where a number of mountain streams (most notably the south-flowing [[Berze|Bērze]] and the north-flowing [[Vilna]]) join, south through the [[Great Chasm]] until it empties into the [[Western Gulf]] north of [[Embry]]. 

The Teft has often been seen as a natural border and cultural divide, and has long divided the [[Heartlands]] of Sembara from the [[Northlands]]. Especially north of the [[Braebein]] it forms an unbridged and only occasionally crossed boundary between [[Breva]] and [[Lavnoch]], In the ancient [[Kestavo|kestavan]] tradition, the [[Teft]] was the home of the children of [[Zeyfa]] and its waters were rarely trusted. 

%% Meta: For the last sentence to be true there should be a fey portal or two along the river  - not clear what is in the feywild here,  but the Zeyfa legend works best if it is a malicious by placatable type of creature and if there is something along the teft that connects. Maybe a water gate of some kind? %%
