# The Tyrwinghan Watershed

Tyrwingha is a small land nestled between the [[Mostreve Hills]] in the south and west, the [[Western Gulf]], in the east, and the two lizardfolk swamps [[Ozabal]] and [[Latazaro]], in the north-west and east, respectively. In between these boundaries a number of rivers flow from the [[Mostreve Hills]] to the [[Western Gulf]], the most important of which are:

* The [[Rhewin]], in the west
* The [[Aben]], which, joined by the [[Trellyn]] and the [[Daran]], flows past [[Tafolwern]] into the [[Tywynn Bay]], a narrow bay of the [[Western Gulf]]
* The [[Llanfen]], in the east, on the edges of [[Latazaro]]

The watershed also includes a number of smaller rivers and brooks, especeially northweset of the [[Rhewin]], where high ground separates the [[Aure]] and [[Enst]] watersheds from Tyrwingha.
