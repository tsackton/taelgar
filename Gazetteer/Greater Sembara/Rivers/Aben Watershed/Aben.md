The largest river in Tyrwingha, it runs out of the [[Mostreve Hills]] towards [[Tafolwern]]. The headwaters of the Aben are a hilly land of many small streams and good timber; there is also a major garrison of the [[Army of Mostreve]], the [[Aben Garrison]].

The Aben runs for about a hundred miles through the Tyrwinghan countryside before the [[Trellyn]] joins it thirty miles south-west of [[Tafolwern]].
