A north-flowing mountain river in the central foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]. The Vilna joins the [[Teft]] a few miles west of the confluence with the south-flowing [[Berze|Bērze]], at the head of the [[Great Chasm]], where the combined waters plunge almost three hundred feet into the giant-carved channel along the chasm's north side.
