# The Teft

A swift-flowing, largely unnavigable river in the north of the Sembara. The Teft flows from the central foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], where a number of mountain streams (most notably the south-flowing [[Berze|Bērze]] and the north-flowing [[Vilna]]) join, south through the [[Great Chasm]] until it empties into the [[Western Gulf]] north of [[Embry]]. 

The Teft has often been seen as a natural border and cultural divide, and has long divided the [[Heartlands]] of Sembara from the [[Northlands]]. Especially north of the [[Braebein]] it forms an unbridged and only occasionally crossed boundary between [[Breva]] and the wilder lands around the [[Great Chasm]]. In the ancient [[Kestavo|kestavan]] tradition, the [[Teft]] was the home of the children of [[Zeyfa]] and its waters were rarely trusted.

For the last sentence to be true there should be a fey portal or two along the river  - not clear what is in the feywild here,  but the Zeyfa legend works best if it is a malicious by placatable type of creature and if there is something along the teft that connects. Maybe a water gate of some kind? 

Feywild ideas and notes:
- In one iteration of my Feywild map, the Sunset Gate runs along the Teft, but the path of the Sunset Gate through Sembara is not canonical, so this could change (potentially the Volta would be a better choice, for example). The Sunset Gate should be constrained to meet the western edge of the [[Grastenvakt]] whatever its path through Sembara
- Generally speaking the Feywild north of approximately the line of the Wistel and east of the Sentinels is pretty open as far as I know. I've done a little development in the west that is not well-captured in notes that is connected with the backstory of one of Isaac's friends in the Great Library game. 
- At one point the ~Talking Animals Realm~ was to go somewhere in this region. This could be a good, or bad, fit to malicious by placable depending on desired vibes. 
- A few other random ideas:
	- The vibe of "malicious but placable fey" is not too far off of Morlaith/Briarheart in Addermarch, and the vibe of Zeyfa definitely has an eastern european fey air. So one possibility is this was also once part of Morlaith's realm, perhaps when the Zimka first crossed the mountains before the Downfall, and as Morlaith has shrunk some new power has moved in. But a lot of the myths of Zeyfa still connect to the Morlaith vibe. Perhaps a little more "Old Forest / Old Man Willow" vibe than Morlaith in Addermarch
	- Something that has a kind of lost in the winter woods vibe would also work well here. Twisting paths, the classic like dwarves in Mirkwood vibe of fey parties off the path that lure you to a doom of some sort.
