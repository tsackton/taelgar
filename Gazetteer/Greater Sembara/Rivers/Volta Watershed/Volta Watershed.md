# The Volta Watershed

The Volta watershed gathers into the [[Volta]] and its tributaries, draining the northern lowlands into the [[Western Gulf]]. For generations the upper Volta has been a borderland of cultures and faiths, and its reaches are closely associated with old [[Kestavo|kestavan]] practice.

Farther downstream, the Volta becomes a working river, and the [[Free City of Tollen]] sits astride it, fed by many smaller tributaries and canals.
