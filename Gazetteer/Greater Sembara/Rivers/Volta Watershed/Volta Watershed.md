The Volta Watershed is the drainage basin of the [[Volta]] and its tributaries, including the waterways that pass through [[Tollen]] and the upper lake country around [[Lake Kamchak]].

In addition to its economic importance—supporting river travel and the growth of towns—the Volta has long served as a cultural boundary in some histories, dividing Sembaran and Zimkovan influences.

## Major waters and tributaries

- Main river: [[Volta]]
- Upper lake: [[Lake Kamchak]]
- Tributaries and city waterways in Tollen: [[Greywash]], [[Muddy River (Tollen)|Muddy River]], [[Little River]], [[Carnbrook]], [[Fat Brook]]
