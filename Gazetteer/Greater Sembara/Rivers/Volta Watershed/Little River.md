The Little River is a minor watercourse, now channeled into a canal, that flows through [[Brooklawn Inner]] before joining the [[Volta]]. Inside the city, the Little River is crossed by numerous bridges over the canal. Before it enters the city, it forms the boundary between [[Brooklawn Outer]] and [[Fairgate Outer]]; this is the center of the tannery and leatherworking districts of the city, and dyers’ sheds and other infrastructure dots the river's edge.
