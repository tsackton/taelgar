The Mournebrook is said to flow northeast out of the [[Shadowmere]]—a haunted swamp on the western edge of the [[Darkwood]]—to join the [[Aure]] a little north of where that river exits the forest. In the southern [[Addermarch|Addermarian]] frontier it is treated as a boundary as much as a watercourse, and few willingly cross it far south of its confluence.

## DM notes

- The Mournebrook is described (but noted as “not mapped”) in [[Addermarch]]; further geographic details may need confirmation against maps.
