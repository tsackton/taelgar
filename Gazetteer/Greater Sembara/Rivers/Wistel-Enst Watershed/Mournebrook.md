%% not mapped, but something like 13.11.A24 to 13.11.D07 is approx %%

The Mournebrook flows northeast out of the [[Shadowmere]]—a haunted swamp on the western edge of the [[Darkwood]]—to join the [[Aure]] a little north of where that river exits the forest. In the southern [[Addermarch|Addermarian]] frontier it is treated as a boundary as much as a watercourse, and few willingly cross it.
