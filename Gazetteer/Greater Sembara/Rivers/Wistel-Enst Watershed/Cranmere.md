A rushing river that leaves the [[Aveil Ridge]] and flows south and west until it joins the [[Auberonne]] near [[Cranford]]. The area to the east of the Cranmère is hilly and less settled, although during [[Cece I|Cece I's reign]] many new villages sprung up in the hills, drawing equally from the [[Barony of Aveil]] and the [[Duchy of Wisford]]. 

The river descends very steeply from the ridge, and it runs unusually cold. The currents and footing are treacherous, and the depth shifts unexpectedly from season to season. Fording the river is considered somewhat foolhardy and is rarely done. The only bridge is at the town of [[Cranford]], which has grown in prominence as the areas east of the Cranmère have been settled.
