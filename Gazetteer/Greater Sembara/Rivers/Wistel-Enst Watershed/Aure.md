# The Aure

A fast‑moving river rising in the [[Darkwood]], the Aure runs north past [[Adderfell]] and across [[Addermarch]] until it joins the [[Enst]] near the edge of the [[Ozabal|Ozabal Swamp]]. Upper reaches cut through forest and low hills; lower reaches widen into gentler meanders.

At [[Adderfell]] the river cascades over a large waterfall into a small lake, forming the height of navigation. From here, goods are gathered and shipped downriver toward [[Eskbridge]] and beyond. North of Adderfell the Aure collects two important tributaries close by: from the west the [[Velan]] (which itself gathers the [[Umber]] near [[Valcroix]]), and from the east the short upland river called the [[Tarn]]. Downstream, the Aure meanders through settled lowlands before mingling with the [[Enst]] south of the marshy waterways of the [[Ozabal|Ozabal Swamp]].

The Aure, which is navigable from [[Adderfell]] to the Enst, is a major route for river trade, and laden boats traveling downriver from [[Adderfell]] carrying timber, brandy, and other goods are a common sight. [[Adderfell]] is by far the most significant river port on the Aure: its quays and warehouses serve as the collection point for valley produce. Merchant houses based there ship barrels downriver to markets along the Enst.

For much of its length, the river supports a productive river valley. Orchards, especially apples, line the gentler slopes and lower terraces of the valley, and the region is known for cider and apple brandy. Farm villages maintain fords and mills along side‑channels and bends, and the river forms the principal artery tying the shires of Addermarch to the broader Sembaran trade.
