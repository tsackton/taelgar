# Umber

The Umber is a slow-moving river that runs from its source in the [[Westcliff]] to the [[~Main Aure Fork~]], which it joins near the market town of [[Valcroix]]. The lower Umber passes through orchards and farmland, but the upper Umber is largely within the [[Torvaine Forest]], and lightly settled. 

The Umber gets its name from its murky, brownish water, colored by forest silt.
