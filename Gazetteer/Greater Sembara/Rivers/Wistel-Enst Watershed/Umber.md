# Umber

The Umber is a slow-moving river that runs from its source in the [[Westcliff]] to the [[Velan]], which it joins near the market town of [[Valcroix]]. The lower Umber passes through orchards and farmland, but the upper Umber is largely within the [[Torvaine Forest]], and lightly settled. A shire road follows the lower course of the Umber for some miles before turning west to cross the [[Torvaine Forest]] to [[Roscombe]]. 

The Umber gets its name from its murky, brownish water, colored by forest silt.
