%% name check for the tributaries in comments; if names seem good I will create pages %%
A major river in [[Sembara]], the Wistel rises in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and flows east across the western marches before mingling with the [[Enst]] through the wetlands of [[Ozabal|Ozabal Swamp]]. From there the combined waters reach the [[Western Gulf]] of the [[Green Sea]]. 

Major tributaries include the [[Bollin]], with a confluence near [[Ainwick]]; numerous lesser streams feeding the middle valley.

Some ideas for tributaries:

West of Ainwick:
* From the northern [[Cleenseau Wood]] meandering north, west, and north again - the Tarnslow
* from the Aine Hills, many small boorks and streams, most prominent are Wetherburn and Mereburn 

Ainwick to Gowerburne:
*  The Chemelle (mapped), from Aine Hills
* The Rindle (meandering river in Wisford, flowing north  and west joining half-way between Gowerburne and Chemelle)

Gowerbourne to Wisford::
* the Lanting (arises near the same spot as the Rindle, flows north-east along the road and turns north-west to join just east of Gowerbourne)
* several small brooks joining between Gowerbourne and Wisford, most prominent  are Holling Brook and Ashwell Brook

East of Wisford:
* Brunebeck, arises near the Enst west and north of Eskbridge, and then follows the line of the Tyrwinghan Road until it joins the Wistel at Wisford. This is presumably the source of the de Brune name
