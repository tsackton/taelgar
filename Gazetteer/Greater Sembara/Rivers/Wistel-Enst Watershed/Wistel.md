A major river in [[Sembara]], the Wistel rises in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and flows east across the western marches before mingling with the [[Enst]] through the wetlands of [[Ozabal|Ozabal Swamp]]. From there the combined waters reach the [[Western Gulf]] of the [[Green Sea]]. 

Major tributaries include:
* West of [[Ainwick]], the [[Tarnslow]], which meanders north and west from the north edge of the  [[Cleenseau Wood]]
* From the [[Aine Hills]], numerous small brooks, the most prominent of which are the [[Wetherburn]] and the [[Mereburn]]
* the [[Bollin]], with a confluence near [[Ainwick]]
* West of [[Gowerbourne]], the [[Chemelle]] which flows south from the [[Aine Hills]], and the [[Rindle]], which flows north from Wisford
* Between [[Gowerbourne]] and [[Wisford]]: the [[Lanting]], and several small brooks, the most prominent of which are [[Holling Brook]] and [[Ashwell Brook]]
* East of [[Wisford]]: the [[Brunebeck]], which joins the Wistel at Wisford
