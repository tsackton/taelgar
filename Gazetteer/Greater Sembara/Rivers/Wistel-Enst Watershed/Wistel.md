A major river in [[Sembara]], the Wistel rises in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and flows east across the western marches before mingling with the [[Enst]] through the wetlands of [[Ozabal|Ozabal Swamp]]. From there the combined waters reach the [[Western Gulf]] of the [[Green Sea]]. 

Major tributaries include the [[Bollin]], with a confluence near [[Ainwick]]; numerous lesser streams feeding the middle valley.
