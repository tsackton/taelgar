A major river in [[Ardlas]] and western [[Sembara]] that joins the [[Wistel]] near [[Ainwick]]. The Bollin is cold and rocky and shallow for much of its length, and is not navigable save for the 30 miles or so upriver of the confluence with the [[Wistel]]. It has three major tributaries:

* The [[Cambril]], which joins just north of the Aine Hills
* The [[Vardell]], which flows east from [[Khatridun]]
* The [[Wethlin]], which flows south near the headwaters of the Bollin
