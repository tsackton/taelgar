%% check/mike: review Character and Use in particular for Wistel details (heavy river traffic from Ainwick to Wisford) which are not well documented  %%

The Wistel–Enst watershed drains much of western and central [[Sembara]], carrying upland waters from the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and the [[Mostreve Hills]] to the [[Western Gulf]]. It consists of three closely linked systems:

- Wistel system: The [[Wistel]] rises in the foothills of the Sentinels and flows east to the marshlands of [[Ozabal|Ozabal Swamp]] on the coast. A major tributary is the [[Bollin]] from the north (joining near [[Ainwick]]). The Wistel meets and mingles with the lower [[Enst]] through the Ozabal wetlands before the combined waters reach the sea.

- Enst system: The [[Enst]] is a cold, rocky river forming much of Sembara’s southern frontier. Above [[Cleenseau]] it splits into the “Three Fingers”: [[Enst (North Fork)]], [[Enst (Middle Fork)]], and [[Enst (South Fork)]], which rejoin near [[Lysandale]]. Key Enst‑basin tributaries include the [[Auberonne]] (forming [[Lake Rin]] at its confluence and fed by the [[Leandre]] and the [[Cranmere|Cranmère]]) and the [[Clavert]] flowing north off [[Westcliff]].

- Aure system: The [[Aure]] rises in the [[Darkwood]] and runs north through [[Addermarch]] to join the Enst near the Ozabal lowlands. North of [[Adderfell]] it gathers the [[Velan]] from the west—which itself receives the [[Umber]] near [[Valcroix]]—and the short upland [[Tarn]] from the east. [[Adderfell]] sits at the height of navigation on the Aure, on a small lake. 

## Character and Use 
%% AI generated - needs review %%

The Wistel supports heavy barge and river traffic on its lower reaches, particularly along the stretch between [[Ainwick]] and [[Wisford]]. The Enst, by contrast, is difficult to cross and forms a major barrier to movement: flooding, cold currents, and limited towpaths restrict navigation. Ferries and a small number of bridges—most notably at [[Cleenseau]] and [[Eskbridge]]—manage crossings where the banks allow. The Aure supports regular riverboat traffic between [[Adderfell]] and the Enst.
