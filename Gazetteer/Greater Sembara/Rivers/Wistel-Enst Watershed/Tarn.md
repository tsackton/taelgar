The Tarn is a short upland river flowing west from the ridge country between [[Addermarch]] and [[Tyrwingha]] to join the [[Aure]] north of [[Adderfell]]. Its narrow valley is dry in places with thin soils but supports significant pasture; the Tarn runs swiftly in spring and dwindles to a manageable flow by late summer.
