# The Enst

A major river along the southern border of [[Sembara]]. It is rocky, cold, and wide for much of its length, and has traditionally been a major barrier to movement. It floods often, and is crossed by only two bridges east of the "Three Fingers", where it splits into the [[Enst (North Fork)|North Fork]], [[Enst (Middle Fork)|Middle Fork]], and [[Enst (South Fork)|South Fork]]: the ancient bridge in [[Cleenseau]], and a more recently constructed bridge just north of the confluence with the [[Aure]] at [[Eskbridge]].

It is navigatable as far upriver as [[Rinburg]], and there is some riverboat traffic between [[Rinburg]], [[Fellburn]], and [[Eskbridge]] much of which continues onward to [[Tyrwingha]]. The lower reaches of the Enst, in [[Ozabal|Ozabal Swamp]] tend to be marshy and treacherous, and there is little to no river traffic beyond [[Eskbridge]]. 

There are ferries at [[Rinburg]], [[Fellburn]], and [[Stavenford]], amongst other places.
