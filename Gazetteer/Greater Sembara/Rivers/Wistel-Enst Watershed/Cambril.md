%%  check/name -> consider whether one or more of the minor Ardlas rivers should retain Old Zimkovan names %%

The Cambril is a fast flowing tributary of the [[Bollin]] that runs through gorges and rocky cascades before joining the river north of the [[Aine Hills]]. It forms the southern boundary of [[Ardlas]].
