The major river of the [[Barony of Aveil]], it flows from near [[Veltor]] just south of the [[Aveil Ridge]] until it joins the [[Enst]] just west of [[Rinburg]]. It is generally fairly placid and slow moving, but narrow and generally not suited to navigation save by small raft or canoe. It very rarely freezes. 

The stretch from [[Peydon]] to [[Lake Rin]] is marked by a barge trail on the western banks, where horse-drawn barges can be seen carting wood and grain to Lake Rin especially after the spring floods.
