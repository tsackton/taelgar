# The Velan

The Velan is a slow, calm river that rises near the lower faces of [[Westcliff]], swings north through open forest and orchards, and then bends south to meet the [[Aure]] not far from [[Adderfell]]. 

Seasonal rains and snowmelt swell the channel in late spring; in drier months the current slows over gravel bars frequented by herons. Generally unnavigable by all but the smallest river craft, the Velan is dotted with small mills and fords where hamlets have bridged or channeled the flow.
