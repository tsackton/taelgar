# The Semb Watershed

The Semb watershed gathers the waters of the [[Semb]] and its tributaries, draining the highlands and foothills of [[Greater Sembara]] into the [[Western Gulf]]. In its upper reaches, the Semb flows past [[Lake Derwent]] in [[Ardlas]]; downriver, it becomes one of the principal waterways of Sembara.

The city of [[Embry]] stands above the Semb and serves as one of the great river ports of the Sembaran heartlands, where goods from upriver are gathered and traded.

### Notes from `_dm_notes`

- `_dm_notes/_Whitesparrow Trouble/Setting.md` describes “Blackwater Bridge” as a walled market town on the upper Semb, where highland wool is traded downriver toward Embry (and overland toward Arnsbury, Telham, and Tollen).
- The same DM note describes the Semb as swift and rapid-filled above and below Blackwater Bridge, with little river traffic in that immediate area. This may be a local condition and could be reconciled with broader statements elsewhere that the Semb is navigable for much of its length.
