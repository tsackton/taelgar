%% Tollen %%

The Little River is a minor watercourse threading the lanes and workshops of [[Tollen]]’s eastern districts before joining the larger waterways of the Wistel–Enst system. Its banks host small mills, dyers’ sheds, and narrow footbridges where students and tradesfolk cross between alleys.

Seasonal freshets swell the channel in spring, while summer reduces it to a manageable flow that exposes shoals used for washerwomen’s stones. City wardens maintain simple weirs and sluices to manage runoff after storms.
