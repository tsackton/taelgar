Westcliff is the long escarpment that bounds the western edge of the [[Mostreve Hills]], a line of broken crags and stepped ledges. The cliffs are a major barrier to travel, with no practical routes for carts to pass west to the [[Maseau Gap]] beyond. Only a few clefts and engineered switchbacks permit passage of sure footed travelers to the plains beyond.

The highest peaks of the [[Mostreve Hills]] can be found here.
