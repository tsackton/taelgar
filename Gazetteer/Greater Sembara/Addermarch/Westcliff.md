Westcliff is the long escarpment that bounds the western edge of the [[Mostreve Hills]], a line of broken crags and stepped ledges that cast afternoon shadows over the lower valleys. The cliff marks a practical barrier for carts; only a few clefts and engineered switchbacks permit passage to the plains beyond.

Goat tracks, raven aeries, and windâ€‘carved hollows dot the face, while the upland above supports thin pasture and scrub. In clear weather, beacons along the cliff can be seen for leagues.
