Northwest of [[Roscombe]], the Kilrath Caves wind beneath an [[Kilrath Standing Stones|ancient ring of stones]]. Recent explorations uncovered a fey-tainted pool, a shadow-haunted side passage, and a cockatrice brood laired around a defunct crystal gate.

%% DM notes
## Geography & Features
- Entry chambers with petrified victims and a shadow‑animate skeleton.  
- Main cavern containing a (now‑destroyed) fey gate crystal, the cockatrice lair, eggs, and a lifelike shepherd statue.  
- A pool inhabited by a naiad, formerly choked by red algae.

## Events
- The party destroyed the cockatrice and hatchlings, negotiated with the naiad to cleanse the pool, recovered Duval jewels and an old holy symbol of [[The Sibyl]], and melted the gate crystal to shut the dormant portal.  
  See: [[Addermarch - Session 03|Addermarch Session 3]].

## Notable Finds
- [[The Sibyl|Sibylline]] gold amulet of an old Tyrwinghan design.  
- Family jewels returned to Lady [[Elowen Duval]].
