>[!info]+ Inns and Taverns in Roscombe
> ***The Traveler's Rest.*** The only inn in Roscombe, a well-built two story building against the wall, near the South Gate (where the road from Valcroix enters town). Run by Bertrand LeBlanc, charming middle-aged man, with a personal connection to the Wanderer. Efficient and organized, and a decent cook as well. 
> 
> ***The Raven's Roost.*** A popular tavern on the market square, where the locals hang out. Run by Madeline Brewer, a young woman, daughter of the old tavern keeper who died unexpectedly a few years ago. Madeline took over the family business and has been thriving. Known for their beer, and the primary brewer in town. 
> 
> ***The Toad.*** A slightly run down tavern, also on the market square. Known for music but a bit seedy. Run by Rhys Dafydd *(REES DAV-ith)*, an older man who's lived here forever and knows all the stories, but doesn't really put much effort into maintenance and has no (living) children (won't talk about family). 

Roscombe is a walled market town in the Addermarch highlands, serving the hill farms and scattered hamlets of [[Carlinshire]]. Set below the tree line on a defensible rise, it anchors trade between the uplands and the low road through [[Valcroix]]. Weekly markets draw shepherds, brewers, and tinkers from the surrounding shires, and the town hosts a small garrison and a resident castellan.

## Layout and Economy
The South Gate opens toward Valcroix and the crossroads. A broad market square sits at the center, ringed by taverns and stalls. Roscombe’s small craft guilds—especially brewers and leatherworkers—trade wool, hides, and timber from the hills for salt, iron, and finished goods brought up from the low country. The town’s inn, [[The Traveler's Rest]], serves merchants and messengers making the climb.

## Governance and Faith
Roscombe is administered by a castellan on behalf of the local lord. Priests of the Sibyl maintain a modest shrine within the walls, and market days are as much social as mercantile events.

## Surroundings
Pastureland, woodlots, and rocky outcrops dominate the environs. Paths lead to hamlets such as [[Brantor]] and up toward the ridge country.
