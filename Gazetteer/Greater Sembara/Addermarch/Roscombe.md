Roscombe is a walled market town in the highlands of western Addermarch, serving the hill farms and scattered hamlets of the [[Stonewolds]] and the [[Highmoor]] in upland [[Carlinshire]]. It is built on a slight ridge, with a commanding view. It is the largest town in the highlands, the principal market town of this area, and the only highland town with its walls still standing. The two largest buildings in the town are the manor, currently occupied by [[Elowen Duval]], and the slate-roofed Temple of the Sibyl, home to a priest, [[Owen Tavish]]. The central plaza contains a well and fountain, and hosts a weekly market. One inn, [[The Traveler's Rest]], near the main gate, provides rooms for the occasional traveler, and a handful of alehouses provide drink and entertainment for the populace. The [[Mill Brook (Roscombe)|Mill Brook]], a rushing brook, flows past the town from the northwest, turning south to cross under the road from [[Valcroix]] about a quarter-mile from the main gates. The only paved road from Roscombe is the road to [[Valcroix]], which is often impassible for carts in the winter or spring due to snow and mud. However, numerous cart tracks lead in all directions towards the scattered villages of the high moors. 

The walls are stone, well-built, and date to the days of the wars against [[Avatus]], several hundred years ago. Although they are crumbling in a few places, the current castellan, [[Elowen Duval]], has invested in their repair. Much of the town is stone cottages with turf roofs, although a few newer buildings have upper stories of timber, including the Traveler's Rest. 


>[!info]+ Inns and Taverns in Roscombe
> ***[[The Traveler's Rest]].*** The only inn in Roscombe, a well-built two story building against the wall, near the South Gate (where the road from Valcroix enters town). Run by Bertrand LeBlanc, charming middle-aged man, with a personal connection to the Wanderer. Efficient and organized, and a decent cook as well. 
> 
> ***The Raven's Roost.*** A popular alehouse on the market square, where the locals hang out. Run by Madeline Brewer, a young woman, daughter of the old tavern keeper who died unexpectedly a few years ago. Madeline took over the family business and has been thriving. Known for their beer, and the primary brewer in town. 
> 
> ***The Toad.*** A slightly run down alehouse, also on the market square. Known for music but a bit seedy. Run by Rhys Dafydd *(REES DAV-ith)*, an older man who's lived here forever and knows all the stories, but doesn't really put much effort into maintenance and has no (living) children (won't talk about family).
