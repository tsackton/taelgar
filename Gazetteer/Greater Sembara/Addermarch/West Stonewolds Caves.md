# The West Stonewolds Caves

>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

An extensive cave system in the western [[Stonewolds]], including an underground river and several deep shafts that connect to hidden Dwarven passages far below the surface of the world. 

The primary known entrance to the cave system is via a surface cavern, often used as kitchen and lair for ogres or trolls. In the rear of the surface cavern, a large pit descends 70 feet to a ledge, and then another 100 feet to the deeper caverns.
