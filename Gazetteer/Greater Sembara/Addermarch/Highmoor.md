The Highmoor is a band of rocky hills and scrub north and east of [[Roscombe]], less wooded with poorer soil and fewer people than the [[Stonewolds]] to the west. This is a windswept land, largely supporting shepherds living in tiny villages. 

The region is dotted with broken limestone outcrops, with occasional small pockets of woodland.

The goblin bandit lair in [[Addermarch - Session 04]] (see: [[Session 4 - DM Notes]] and [[Session 5 - DM Notes]]) is in the northern Highmoor. 

The village of [[Haldrenn]] is also in the Highmoor.
