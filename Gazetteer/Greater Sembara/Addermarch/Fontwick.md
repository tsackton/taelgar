%% minor village in Addermarch %%

Fontwick is a small upland village on the edges of the [[Stonewolds]], a cluster of stone cottages and byres gathered around a spring. Its folk tend sheep on the rough grasses between rocky outcrops and cut timber from coppiced lots. A wayside shrine and a single alehouse serve as the villageâ€™s social center.
