%% from original Plaguelands campaign, west of Adderfell %%

Dunwick is a modest market town west of [[Adderfell]], straddling the route between the March’s upland farms and the larger trade houses to the north. Known for hardy shepherding and small tanneries, it gathers wool and leather for sale on monthly fairs, then ships surplus downslope before winter closes the byways.

## Setting and Trade
Low stone walls, slate roofs, and smoke from dye‑pits mark the outskirts. A timbered hall beside the square hosts the fair tolls and town moot. Surrounding hamlets bring fleeces, hides, and herb gear; in return, Dunwick imports salt, iron fittings, and finished cloth.

## Security and Roads
The town maintains a watch to keep the lanes passable in foul weather and to mind the dangers that drift north from the deeper hills. Messages bound for Adderfell are relayed by courier when snows are heavy.
