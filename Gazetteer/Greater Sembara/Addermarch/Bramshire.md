The smallest of the three shires that owe allegiance to the Earl of the Mostreve. Bramshire is based in the northern hills of Addermarch, south of the Sembaran [[Barony of Brumecliff]]. This area was intensely fortified in the DR 1600s when the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] occupied the lands to the north, and many castles dot the hills of this land. 

The largest settlement is around the fortified castle of [[Ravignac]], on high ground with a commanding view over the [[Clavert]] river valley to the north.
