%% Old Documents from first Plaguelands campaign. Not canonical but might have useful vibes to mine:

%%

Nestled in the [[Mostreve Hills]] southwest of [[Tyrwingha]], east of the [[Duchy of Maseau]], south of the [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]], and north of the haunted [[Darkwood]] lies the ancient hill kingdom of Addermarch. This is a land of rolling hills, swift rivers, and dense forests; a rugged land of independent folk fiercely proud of their long history and ancient traditions. 

Addermarch was settled long ago, before the [[Drankorian Empire|Drankorians]] came, by a people sharing a cultural and linguistic tradition with [[Tyrwingha]]. During the [[Drankorian Era]], it was a backwater province of the [[Drankorian Empire]], never densely settled, but supported and garrisoned as a ward against the dangers of the [[Darkwood]]. 

%% some notes on this point; none of these are necessarily canonical:
- Original settlers may have included a substantial number of exiles from Tyrwingha, or people who rejected Ethlenn's bargain
- Addermarch is on the other side of the Sunset Gate from Ethlenn; another possibility could be that Ethlenn for some reason could only extend her protection (against, e.g. Morlaith) along the Sunset Gate, and so the people in Addermarch were the ones who stayed in their homes instead of moving back to Tyrwingha (this supposes that pre-Ethlenn, the proto-Tyrwingha spread across the Mostreve Hills, but I actually kind of like this better that point 1). 
- Left unclear per previous discussion is where these people came from, and how they interacted with elves to south and lizardfolk to north pre-Downfall.
- Fundamentally, though, the vibe is that it was Ethlenn/feywild politics that set Addermarch and Tyrwingha on separate courses through history
%%

With the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], Addermarch charted its own course as a frontier kingdom, isolated from [[Sembara]] by poor roads, difficult travel, and occasionally war. While sharing a language, a religion, and a cultural connection, Addermarch has never acknowledged the sovereignty of Sembaran or Tyrwinghan monarchs, excepting during the height of the [[House of Sewick]] in the years leading to the [[Great War]]. 

%% Note: Addermarch was never conquered in the wars since the fall of Drankor. It was isolated completely from [[Sembara]] during the height of the [[Dominion of Avatus]], although never cut off from [[Tyrwingha]]; it was besieged to the south but never entered during the [[Great War]]; and it was largely isolated except for dangerous passage along the [[Aure]] during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]]. 

Leaving in for now that Addermarch earls acknowledged [[Derik I]] as their overking, which lasted until the death of [[Derik III]]. 
%%

Now, Addermarch is a land of small farmers, foresters, highland cattle, and sheepherders, known primarily for its famed apple brandy that is traded downriver into [[Sembara]], but also a significant producer of timber, wool, and cheese. Addermarch has friendly relationships with the three human kingdoms on its borders: [[Tyrwingha]], [[Sembara]], and [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]]. Sembara is economically and culturally dominate in the region, and many merchant houses in Addermarch have close ties to traders and bankers in Sembara. But not all in Addermarch believe that Sembara will necessarily come to Addermarch's aid, and a spirit of independence prevails in some circles.
## Geography 

*See more: [[Mostreve Hills]]*

Addermarch is a hill country, set entirely within the [[Mostreve Hills]]. The western parts of the kingdom are steep, rocky, and dominated by massive escarpments dropping to the Maseau plains and the [[Maseau Gap]], while the central regions of the kingdom are a mix of rolling hills, forests, and small river valleys, the largest and most significant of which is the [[Aure]] valley. Addermarch itself is approximately 23,000 square miles. %% bigger than Wales, a litter smaller than Ireland %%
### Climate

Most of Addermarch has hot and humid summers, with plenty of rain, and mild winters with relatively little snow. However, there is considerable variation, with the higher elevations frequently getting significant winter snowfall. 

%% Roughly parallel to mid-Atlantic Appalachians %%
### Regions

%%^Campaign:none%%

![[addermarch-schematic-details.png]]

A rough schematic to go with the player facing text below, although quality not great. 

The basic vibe is four regions, in red, though there are five earls. These are described in more detail in the player section:
- Western hills
- Central and northern river valley
- Southern borders
- Eastern borders

Green is roughly population density. Highest settlement is along the Aure, and the western tributaries, especially the Velan. Lighter settlement in the surrounding highlands and borderlands, though here I suspect it goes southern borders > westcliff > eastern highlands. 

Orange is supposed to generally indicate fortification density. The southern reaches have always been fortified against the [[Darkwood]], and even more so post-Great-War (so the earl of the south is really a military commander); this drives higher settlement density here to support armies. Although Addermarch armies are not actually state armies they are whatever troops the earl can muster. I kind of imagine there must be cross-earldom deals that basically support the southern earl with funds from the richer heartlands otherwise the plaguelands castles couldn't be sustained. 

The lesser fortification density to the west and northwest is mostly not maintained, and dates to Avatus or the hobgoblin wars. A key part of my Addermarch game is that the earl of westcliff has not be investing in defenses, and many of the old avatus castles are now ruins to explore. But also this is bordering massau, and the plaguelands frontier in this direction is a ways south, so this is not necessarily a bad decision. 

The eastern border with trywinghan has basically never been fortified, there has never really been danger from that direction.

Here is an old map that, while not strictly canon (Dunwick is no more, for instance), is kind of roughly right:
![[southern-addermarch-old-map.png]]

%%^End%%

Addermarch consists of four distinctive regions, each with their own culture and economy. 

#### Western Highlands
_See more: [[Carlinshire]], [[Weskershire]], [[Bramshire]], [[Westcliff]]_

To the west and northwest, the rugged terrain of the [[Westcliff]] tumbles down to the [[Velan]] river valley. This is a region of rough hills and mountains, which form high and often-impassable ramparts, especially on the western borders. It is also a region of productive, forested valleys, especially along the [[Velan]]; the lowlands near [[Valcroix]], at the confluence of the [[Velan]] and the [[Umber]], are one of the major agricultural centers of Addermarch. The high meadows, though, are more isolated, cut off from the [[Velan]] by the dense [[Torvaine Forest]], and are lightly populated by sheepherders and harder farmers. This area was extensively fortified at multiple times in the past, but the castles in the hills have not all been maintained and many are now in ruins. 

%% Setting for the [[Addermarch Campaign]]. vibe is Appalachian, but also the higher peaks have a bit more rugged feel and thin soil, with lots of caves and pasturelands. Generally rolling hills gradually climbing to steep hills/mountains. Mostly sheep herders. %%

%% rough map: ![[Dwarf Map from Cockatrice Cave.jpg]] %%

#### Aure River Valley

The heartlands of Addermarch are the Aure river valley. This is a land of gently rolling hills, open forests, and many small rivers and streams that flow from the surrounding highlands to the [[Aure]]. This region is the most densely settled of all of Addermarch, and includes the capital, [[Adderfell]], which sits at the height of navigation of the Aure. The lower reaches of the [[Branth]] and the [[Velan]], the two most important tributaries of the [[Aure]], are also densely settled. To the north, the Aure crosses into the [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]]. This region is the center of apple production in Addermarch, and well served by riverboat traffic along the Aure, which is navigable all the way from [[Adderfell]] to the [[Enst]]. 

%% 
Shenandoah/Blue Hills, Susquehana river valley. Lots of apple orchards.
Open question is what the northern part of the Aure valley looks like. I don't have a good sense for how far east the hobgoblins got, or where the Sembaran/Tyrwingha border is, exactly, and how far up the Enst the swamps really extend. There is definitely some fleshing out to do here. 
%%

#### Southern Borderlands
_See more: [[Darkwood]], [[Shadowmere]]_

South of Adderfell, the Aure runs swiftly from its source in [[Darkwood]], and the wilds encroach. A line of gentle hills gradually climbs along the eastern banks of the Aure, beyond which the dense forest of the [[Darkwood]] lies to trap the unwary. To the west, the [[Mournebrook]] flows northeast from the [[Shadowmere]], a haunted swamp on the western edge of the [[Darkwood]], and few dare cross its water south of its confluence with the [[Aure]]. South of the river village of [[Tygate]], this region is very lightly populated, mostly with smallholds of foresters and furriers. It is, however, well-defined: a line of fortifications watches the forest eaves (cf. [[Darkwood Keep]]) and runs along the hilltops to the east to watch for dangers from the [[Plaguelands]]. 

%% 
Also mid-Atlantic Appalachians but very wooded.

The basic geography is that the western edge of the [[Darkwood]] forms a basin (the Shadowmere), out of which flows the Mournebrook (not mapped) across forested flat land to join the Aure a little north of where it exits the [[Darkwood]]. Few travel south of this confluence. 

To the east, the land begins to gently rise in a series of rolling hills (think maybe Berkshires, not mountains). These are wooded, but it is a more open, less scary wood, and some timber, charcoal, and other wood products are exported via Tygate to Adderfell from here. This basically the unnamed tributary of the [[Branth]]. 

As you go further east the land gets more rocky, and higher elevation, until you meet the north-south ridge that forms the Tyrwinghan border and is much higher elevation. 

The fortifications here really are probably more oriented towards the [[Darkwood]] than the Plaguelands; to a certain extent the rough terrain is presumed to be a significant barrier to anything trying to cross into Addermarch here. 
 
%%
#### Eastern Highlands

To the east and northeast, along the borders of [[Tyrwingha]], the poor soil of the hilly, rocky land keeps forests to sheltered valleys. This is largely rangeland: highland cattle graze in the high pastures in summer, and only in a few sheltered valleys do crops thrive. The [[Branth]] is the most significant river in this region, and the [[Branth]] valley where most of the few people who live in this part of Addermarch settle. East of the headwaters of the [[Branth]], the land turns quickly rocky, hard to travel, and dangerous; north of the [[Branth]], the hills get quickly steeper. The Tyrwinghan borderlands is lightly settled by cattle herders who bring their herds to the high meadows to graze in the summer. 

%% more open meadows, less forests, perhaps also a bit Provence-ish? Note the northern/eastern slopes are more wooded than the southern/western slopes%%
### Borders

To the west and northwest Addermarch is bordered by the [[Westcliff]], a series of sharp cliffs and dangerous terrain that separates the realm from the flat plains of the [[Duchy of Maseau]] to the west, and the [[Borderlands|Sembaran borderlands]] to the north. At the Aure, the high ridge of [[Westcliff]] is cut by the river, and on the eastern bank, the land is much lower. Here an ancient line of border stones running to [[~High Peak of Tyrwinghan Ridge~]] demarcates the border with [[Tyrwingha]]. These stones are said by some to be raised by Drankor, but they are marked with complex warnings in [[Sylvan Writing|Sylvan]], and many believe they have fey origins.

The eastern border is not marked, as the high terrain between Addermarch and Tyrwinghan is unpopulated. The gentler, forested slopes to the north and east are under the demense of Tyrwinghan earls, and the dryer, arid slopes to the south and west, the land of Addermarian earls.

To the south, Addermarch is bordered by the high ridge of the [[Mostreve Hills]], where the [[Branth]] arises, and then, to the southwest, the [[Darkwood]]. This border is carefully watched for fear of what might creep out in the shadows. 

%% something more could be said about the northern border here. it is a bit of a blank spot on the map, but i don't have a great sense of this part of Sembara%%

## History

Addermarch was settled long ago, by a people closely related to the ancient Tyrwinghans. Before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], [[Tyrwingha]] and Addermarch were part of a shared patchwork of petty kingdoms, settled in the highlands of the [[Mostreve Hills]] above the great, ancient lizardfolk swamps of the lowlands. However, Addermarch is outside the boundaries of the [[Archfey Ethlenn]]'s influence, and as Tyrwingha grew closer to the fey, the fate of the two realms diverged. 

%% [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]]; also consider possibility that many early settlers to Addermarch are explicitly exiles from Tyrwingha, or people who reject the deal with Ethlenn %%

After the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], as the [[Drankorian Empire]] grew to the south, dark things also crept into the woods to the south, no longer guarded or watched so closely by the elves, and the great forests on the southern slopes of the [[Mostreve Hills]] became known as the [[Darkwood]]. The people of Addermarch built standing stones to protect against incursions from the [[Feywild]], and watched their borders closely. 

%% exact timing left a bit unclear but the implication is that Drankor comes some relatively short time after the [[Darkwood]] becomes dark, and perhaps are welcomed as protectors to a certain extent. this is tied to [[Lord Umbraeth]] and the growth of [[Duskmire]] but details are not clearly worked out yet %%

During this time, Addermarch is incorporated into the [[Drankorian Empire]] as a minor province, and the city of [[Adderfell]] grows significantly, from a small village at the height of navigation of the [[Aure]] to a substantial urban center. The Drankorians, too, fortify the southern borders, and keep a close watch on the [[Darkwood]], but Addermarch remains lightly settled. 

%% Drankorians probably build a road along the Aure, to supply border forts beyond the height of navigation, but there are not a lot of Drankorian cities here %%

The fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] is little noticed in Addermarch at first, although it soon becomes a dangerous time as the Drankorian wizards that once guarded against incursions from the [[Darkwood]] slowly decline in number and effectiveness. During this time, as to the north the six duchies of [[Sembara]] are becoming established, Addermarch, despite suffering a series of upheavals, develops many of the governance traditions that still guide the realm. In the DR 1300s, threat of the [[Dominion of Avatus]] grows on the western borders of Addermarch. The Maseau Escarpment is heavily fortified, and a series of skirmishes are fought to a stalemate.

%% Leaving the details intentionally vague, but the basic idea is between 1059 - 1300 or so, you have a variety of conflicts, both external and self-inflicted, out of which emerges the current system of an "elected" overking from among the earls who serves as the commander in chief and head of state. The idea is that Addermarch is pretty war-torn during this time, and very isolated, with both external wars and some power grabs / internal wars between earls. The idea is that the threat of the [[Dominion of Avatus]] drives a lot of unification within Addermarch and ends a long unsettled period where there is often not really a sens of Addermarch as a single kingdom but rather a series of petty earldoms. Possibly part of the compromise here is to strip vassals from the earls (or most earls, except the earl of the west who needs vassals to protect against Avatus, but there probably never were hard borders anyway and they are not established now. %%

This long stasis shifts dramatically when [[Avatus]] invades [[Sembara]] in the early 1400s. Addermarch is nearly completely surrounded, kept from defeat only by the valiant efforts of guerilla warbands fighting in the rough hills of the escarpment. 

%% Possibility is that the guerilla troops - something like Faramir's bands in the LoTR, are one of the forerunners [[The Rangers|to the Rangers]] %%

When [[Derik I]] marches at the head of the combined armies of [[Sembara]] and [[Tyrwingha]], the earls of Addermarch quickly join, and in support of the war establish [[Derik I]] as the overking of Addermarch. Over the next hundred years or so, a close relationship between Addermarch and [[Sembara]] develops. While the earls of Addermarch never become vassals of the Sembaran crown, when [[Derik I]] dies, [[Derik II]] is acknowledged as overking of Addermarch, a tradition that continues through the reigns of [[Charlotte I]] and [[Derik III]]. During the [[Great War]], the armies of [[Sembara]] and Addermarch fight together as one. 

%% The intention here is that Addermarch fits into the "Greater Sembara" narrative of the pre-Great-War years as basically a close ally; Sembara never has any meaningful role in the internal affairs of Addermarch -- Addermarch doesn't have a strong monarch in any case -- but functionally for "defense against monsters and evil" the Sembaran monarch is the boss. I think Sembara probably also contributes funds towards building fortifications and repairing fortifications along the [[Darkwood]] in this time as well. But, once Derik III dies, this all kind of falls apart. Possibly made worse by Sembara's relative lack of aid in the various plaguelands dangers that hit Addermarch hard.%%

After the [[Great War]], Addermarch suffers during the chaos of the early part of the [[Blood Years]]. After Derik III's death, neither [[Bertram I]] nor [[Jane of Tollen]] are  acknowledged as overking (in part because in Addermarch there is no real concept of regency, in part because they are seen as out of touch with the dangers of the [[Plaguelands]]), and Addermarch turns inward. The next forty years are a dark time, plagued with constant threats from the south. 

%% Details are thin, but the intent here is that this sets up (a) growing influence of Rangers and the Addermarch style of guerilla fighting on the southern border, (b) growing distance from Sembara  which is seen as consumed by internal bickering and its western borders, and too willing to let the southern kingdoms ([[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], Addermarch, and to a lesser extent [[Tyrwingha]]) bear the brunt of the defense against the terrors of the [[Plaguelands]], and (c) set up the central government as growing stronger and with some rearranging of taxes so that there is a bit more of an idea of a common defense (e.g., perhaps the overking and/or the council of earls has the right to levy particular taxes for the purposes of funding the common defense). %%

During the [[Second Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]], Addermarch and [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] form a close alliance, and Addermarch is the first to send aid when war breaks out. After the war, Addermarch is left with the Shattered Ice hobgoblins occupying much of the land directly northwest of it, and the fortifications in the Maseau Escarpment are repaired and reinforced. During the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]], Addermarch again marches in alliance with Sembara, but unlike during the [[Great War]], neither [[Arryn II]] nor [[Cece I]] are acknowledged as the overking of Addermarch. 

%% Part of the vibe here is that Addermarch potentially felt a bit betrayed by the treaty that ended the Second Hobgoblin War, which left Addermarch significantly more isolated than it was before the war started. Probably Sembara didn't have much choice as the war was, at best, a stalemate, but realistically people are irrational and so the idea that distant Sembaran royalty doesn't have the best interests of Addermarch at heart probably gets solidified here. This is in contrast to the [[Great War]] years, when Sembara and Derik I was seen as the savior of Addermarch freeing the realm from constant conflict with Avatus. %%

When peace finally comes with the defeat of the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] in DR 1653, the borders of Addermarch are (relatively) safe for the first time in 300 years. The second half of the 1600s is a time of rapid growth in Addermarch. [[Adderfell]] grows, and many of the brandy houses are founded during this time. Roads are repaired, and river traffic on the [[Aure]] grows significantly. The [[Darkwood]] still looms, but these are golden years, a time of peace and prosperity. 

In these golden years last until DR 1720, when the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]] break out. While Addermarch is not heavily affected by undead itself, the [[Enst]] valley suffers a great deal, and once again the people of Addermarch refortify. In the modern day, Addermarch remains watchful. The generation that came of age during the zombie attacks, now the earls and knights of the realm, have not forgotten.

%% this is a little undeveloped and needs input on current events from Taelgar 1720, plus recent Sembaran history which is currently non-existent. however, basic vibe is that 1650-1720 was a period of rapid growth, economic development, and a time when resources went to roads and cities not castles and forts. since the zombie attacks, things are a bit more balanced and people don't forget, so current day is not exactly the "golden age" vibe but also not the "isolated guerilla warriors of the 1600-1650" period. 

From Mike: I think the combination of the War of the Ashen Horde and the zombie attacks is a good turning point. The undead attacks in my game never arose much in Addermarch, but there is no canonical reason they couldn't have. The basic idea was the lich cast a spell that pretty much awoke some random percentage of battlefield dead in the broad Enst river valley - and then used his henchman in the army to mismanage the response. The [[Army of the South]] which would have traditionally coordinated with with Addermarch, was in fact maliciously redirected - some to go on a wild goose chase to try to find some fake artifact in the borderlands, and some to defend Embry. The Duke of Wisford managed to redirect some of them, and formed a core of resistance, and fought two battles, one at [[Gowerbourne]] and one at [[Fellburn]]. What was happening in Addermarch is ill-defined, actually. There was no real hint that the undead were _directed_ by the lich at all, it was more like - awaken what he can and then see what happens, mismanaging the response. The only thing I did establish in game was that Tyrwinghan was never invaded, but mustered an army along the Enst near [[Eskbridge]] - clearly due to some type of fear of invasion. 

It is entirely plausible that during this period Tyrwingha - via Ethlenn - is very concerned with protecting its borders, and there could easily have been hobgoblin zombies awakening in the Westcliff and northern parts of Addermarch that attacked south, even though it never came up in game. I had a few rangers from Addermarch come north, but one of the points of the whole thing was it was random and disconnected, and also the dead move at different speeds, so they could easily have come north before Addermarch attacks got bad.

Alternatively the vibe in Addermarch could be more like in Tyrwinghan - fortifying the borders and looking it your own defenses, with a lot of skepticism about what was going in Sembara. Anyone with a brain and the ability to follow troop movements would have realized something was wrong as the monarch was not doing what he should to protect the realm.

## Life in Addermarch

### Culture and Religion

The people of Addermarch are, in many ways, like the people of southern Sembaran and Tyrwingha. They worshop [[Mos Numena]], following the Sembaran customs to a large extent, and they speak Sembaran (with a southern dialect; unlike in Tyrwingha to the east, there is no lingering pockets of people speaking the ancient tongues, although ancient inscriptions in the Old Tollish script can be found). 

The land is hard, especially in the hills and mountains, and the people of Addermarch are largely independent, insular, and self-sufficient. Travel is difficult, and the constant danger of the tricksy fey from the [[Darkwood]] and other dangerous places keeps people on guard against strangers and unusual happenings. There are fewer [[Dwarves|dwarves]] than one might expect, but more [[Elves|elves]], mostly from [[Orenlas]], and [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]], mostly from the [[Ozabal]] and [[Latazaro]] swamps. 

The population of Addermarch is very rural. There is only one significant city, [[Adderfell]], and while small market towns (often fortified) dot the landscape, most people live in small villages or isolated homesteads. 

### Political Organization, Justice, and the Law

%% this has kind of solidified a bit in the addermarch campaign and feels pretty solid to me, so no longer consider it draft, at least not in broad strokes. minor details are not necessarily canonical %%

Addermarch is a feudal oligarchy, with power centralized in the hands of the Earl's Court, composed of the five hereditary earls of Addermarch, whose claim to power traces back to ancient days. The Earl's Court has, in times of danger, elected one of their own, or even an outsider, as the commander in chief of the army, and over time this role has been formalized into the High Lord of Addermarch, who serves as a kind of overking, and is allowed to style themselves Defender of the Realm. 

Each earl functions as the monarch of a circuit, defined by the villages and towns in their demesne. Within this circuit, the Earl is responsible for administering justice and providing for the defense of their territory, and has the right to tax the labor of the land to provide for its upkeep. However, generally speaking there is no manorial feudalism in Addermarch. Instead, an Earl would typically appoint a knight of their court to serve as the lord of a particular castle or manor. However, there is no expectation that this title is inherited, and although there are often significant land holdings which provide rents for castle upkeep, the knights and castellans have no vassalage relationship with the commoners. Indeed, many villages, especially in the protected interior, have no manor, and often have a strong tradition of common land. 

There are also a few hundred hereditary knights in Addermarch: while some of these are attached to possession of land holdings, often a manor, many others are, like earls, itinerant. 

%% the vibe I'm aiming for is a bit of feudalism but with less hierarchy and kind of looser than Sembara. You don't have layers of vassals and lords, basically there are just earls and knights, with the knights perhaps divided into hereditary knighthoods, which must be confirmed by the full Earl's Court, and temporary ones, granted by a particular Earl. Perhaps the hereditary knights also serve as something like a House of Lords within each Earldom, or at least are required to confirm the Earl - so Earls are not absolute monarchs. But these details don't really matter that much for now.

From Mike: Some knights, I think should be, like earls, itinerant, but I like the vibe of a set of hereditary titles that form the basis for a House of Lords type institution. In Sembara the monarch is ultimately accountable to the dukes and major barons; in Tyrwingha the monarch is elected by the fey oracle; having a robust (100-200) body of knights who form an electoral basis for the earls feels like a nice contrast but also isn't too different 

Adding: a question is how new knights get created. I think probably any earl can knight someone, but to create a new hereditary title requires a vote of the full Earl's Court. 
%%

The five Earls of Addermarch are known as:
- The Earl of Adderfell, who, unlike other Earls, is the lord of the city of Adderfell (but includes some outlying villages in their demesne) 
- The Earl of Westcliff, whose circuit includes all of the [[Westcliff]], as well as parts of the upper Aure valley, especially on the western part of Addermarch. The Earl of Westcliff is the lord of three shires: [[Bramshire]] (northern hills bordering [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]]), [[Carlinshire]] (northwestern hills, upper reaches of [[Umber]]), [[Weskershire]] (West Cliff and south). These shires are each centered around major defenses on the western and northern border, and have hereditary lords. 
- The Earl of Southmarch, whose circuit includes the southern Aure. 
- The Earl of Aurenvale, whose circuit is largely in the Aure river valley, in particular the northern and eastern stretches, interdigitating with the Earl of the Westcliff in parts of the western Aure valley, and the Earl of High Tyrn in parts of the eastern Aure valley. 
- The Earl of High Tyrn, whose circuit includes the eastern part of the Aure river valley, and the highlands along the Tyrwinghan border. %%Tyrn -> *TEERN*%%
 
Note these circuits are not strict lines on a map and often overlap, but each village is part of the domain of a single earl.

%% 

Note that the Earls of Adderfell and Aure control typically by far the richest and most populous land, and thus are the richest and strongest. 

The Earl of Westcliff and the Earl of the Southern Reaches are next, though in the 1710s-1720s the vibe of Westcliff is kind of benign neglect of the highlands and a strong focus on developing the lowlands, which has led to a lot of castles falling into ruin. But this has not really mattered as the western border is not to dangerous in this time perriod. 

The Earl of the Southern Reaches must get some kind of tithe or stipend from the Earl's Court to support the common defense, as there is certainly not enough wealth in their domain to support the [[Darkwood]] fortifications themselves. In my non-canonical Plaguelands campaign, the Earl of Addermarch provided significant support to the south, FWIW. 

Earl of HIghlands is poorest, at least in the 1710s. This is both sparsely populated and thought to be safe (borders Tyrwingha), so is neglected. 

%%
### Economy, Trade, and Foreign Relations

Addermarch does not have major trade connections to elsewhere, despite being rich in raw materials. The largest export industry is brandy, which is produced by a number of brandy houses based in Adderfell, and exported down river to Sembaran and beyond.
