Nestled in the [[Mostreve Hills]] southwest of [[Tyrwingha]], east of the [[Duchy of Maseau]], south of the [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]], and north of the haunted [[Darkwood]] lies the ancient hill kingdom of Addermarch. This is a land of rolling hills, swift rivers, and dense forests; a rugged land of independent folk fiercely proud of their long history and ancient traditions. 

Addermarch was settled long ago, before the [[Drankorian Empire|Drankorians]] came, by a people sharing a cultural and linguistic tradition with [[Tyrwingha]]. During the [[Drankorian Era]], it was a backwater province of the [[Drankorian Empire]], never densely settled, but supported and garrisoned as a ward against the dangers of the [[Darkwood]]. 

%% Possibility: original settlers may have included a substantial number of exiles from Tyrwingha, or people who rejected Ethlenn's bargain, which may color the perception of the fey in Addermarch. %%

With the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], Addermarch charted its own course as a frontier kingdom, isolated from [[Sembara]] by poor roads, difficult travel, and occasionally war. While sharing a language, a religion, and a cultural connection, Addermarch has never acknowledged the sovereignty of Sembaran monarches, excepting during the height of the [[House of Sewick]].

%% Note: Addermarch was never conquered in the wars since the fall of Drankor. It was isolated completely from Sembara during the height of the [[Dominion of Avatus]], although never cut off from [[Tyrwingha]]; it was besieged to the south but never entered during the [[Great War]]; and it was largely isolated except for dangerous passage along the [[Aure]] during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]]. 

Leaving in for now that Addermarch earls acknowledged Derik I as their overking, which lasted until the death of Derik III.

Now, Addermarch is a land of small farmers, foresters, and sheepherders, known primarily for its famed apple brandy that is traded downriver into Sembara, but also a significant producer of timber and wool. Enjoying favorable tariffs for its goods in exchange for its role in protecting Sembara’s southern borders, Addermarch is a close ally of Sembara.

%% Not sure about the last sentence, might not fit the vibe. Although it probably should be a close ally of Sembaran post hobgoblin wars %%

## Geography 

*See more: [[Mostreve Hills]]*

Addermarch is a hill country, set entirely within the [[Mostreve Hills]]. The western parts of the kingdom are steep, rocky, and dominated by massive escarpments dropping to the Maseau plains and the Gap of Maseau, while the central regions of the kingdom are a mix of rolling hills, forests, and small river valleys, the largest and most significant of which is the [[Aure]] valley. Addermarch itself is approximately 23,000 square miles. %% bigger than Wales, a litter smaller than Ireland %%
### Climate

Most of Addermarch has hot and humid summers, with plenty of rain, and mild winters with relatively little snow. However, there is considerable variation, with the higher elevations frequently getting significant winter snowfall. 

%% Roughly parallel to mid-Atlantic Appalachians %%
### Regions

%% DRAFT and might change once I make a better map. Also all names are tentative %%

Addermarch is roughly divided into four major geographic regions:
- To the west and northwest, the Maseau Escarpment is a region of rough hills and some mountains that borders the flat plains of the Maseau Gap. This is a hard land with few people. This area was extensively fortified at multiple times in the past, but the castles in the hills have not all been maintained and many are now in ruins. %% very mountainous, steep cliffs, maybe Provence-like? white mountains %%
- The center of the realm is the Aure river valley, a land of rolling hills, forests, and many rivers that cut through the hills. This region is the most densely settled, and includes Adderfell, the only real city in Addermarch. This is also the major agricultural land in Addermarch, and the center of brandy production. The Aure is navigable from Adderfell to the Enst, and many riverboats ply their trade along it. %% Shenandoah/Blue Hills, Susquehana river valley%%
- To the south and east of the Aure valley are several lines of wooded hills and mountains, rising gradually to the height of land on the eaves of the Darkwood. This region is well-guarded, and lightly populated, mostly with smallholds of foresters and furriers. %% also mid-Atlantic Appalachians but very wooded%%
- To the east and northeast, along the borders of Tyrwingha, the poor soil of the hilly, rocky land keeps forests to sheltered valleys. This is largely rangeland: sheep and cattle graze in the high pastures in summer, and only in a few sheltered valleys do crops survive. %% more open meadows, less forests, perhaps also a bit Provence-ish? %%
### Borders

To the west and nothwest Addermarch is bordered by the Maseau Escarpment, a series of sharp cliffs and dangerous terrain that separates the realm from the flat plains of the Duchy of Maseau to the west, and the Sembaran borderlands to the north. 

To the north and east, Addermarch is bordered by Tyrwingha, although in many places this border

Moving east, the northern border cuts across the Aure river valley, and then turns south, where the border between Tyrwingha and Addermarch -- rarely tracked or marked -- runs along the gentle wooded hills that gradually rise to higher peaks.

To the south, Addermarch is bordered by the Darkwood and the Plaguelands, and this border is carefully watched for fear of what might creep out in the shadows. 

## History

%% TO DO - summary is discord %%

%% discord raw notes:
basically trying to work out a rough history. my recollection from the Duskmire history is that the Darkwood goes way back. there is a note suggesting that Umbraeth was exiled in the DR 600s, but not sure if that is strictly canonical

but assuming that Darkwood is a dangerous place during the Drankorian expansion (timing is not perfect, but relatively close), Addermarch is probably a pretty marginal backwater during the Drankorian era

I'm imagining the geography/climate as kind of mid-Atlantic Applachians. Addermarch itself is pretty hilly with difficult overland travel, except along the (few) navigable rivers / river valleys

so my basic history is that:

pre-Drankor, Addermarch is settled by Tyrwinghans, but is always fairly marginal

Drankor, it is a province of Drankor, but not a particularly important one. but crucially outside the deal with Ethlenn so more directly assimilated

have some forestry, and the Aure is navigable as far as Addermarch, so not a total economic dead zone. but not rich by any means.

in the Timeline of Sembaran history, Addermarch is noted to be established as the Earldom of Adderfell (presumably being called an Earldom due to cultural and historical connections to Tyrwingha) in lands formerly controlled by Avatus

here it seems like there are two possibilities, based on the geography that has Addermarch as kind of a pocket surrounded by hills on three sides (west, south, east):

one option would be that this was an area that suffered from hobgoblin and other raids for a long time after the major defeats of Avataus, basically a backwater where many of the hobgoblins, etc, in Avatus army fled

a different option would be actually this was never conquered, but was cut of from Sembara by Avatus, and so during the post plague years it was really functionally a part of Tyrwingha

in either case, it becomes part of the Sembaran crown during Derik I's rule, after the defeat of Avatus

Deciusmus — Today at 5:45 PM

I’m not convinced that Atavus stuff has to be canonical

I’ve imagined the western and northern borders of addermarch to be pretty rough terrain

So it seems plausible it was never conquered and has an older history

rsulfuratus — Today at 5:47 PM

yeah, basic idea is that the western edge of the mostreve hills is a very rough, with a steep escarpment particularly on the west that borders the Gap of Maseau

less rough to the northeast where the Aure flows towards the Enst, of course, and less rough towards Tyrwingha

Deciusmus — Today at 5:48 PM

The Tyrwinghan part of the mostreve hills I’ve established as much denser in fey than elsewhere and not very settled but where settled very traditional

rsulfuratus — Today at 5:48 PM

that makes sense

potentially Ethlenn's domain might extend southeast towards Orenlas, putting the Tyrwinghan Mostreve hills at the center

Deciusmus — Today at 5:49 PM

Yeah maybe

I think the settlement of addermarch was probably originally a bit complex - tyrwinghans but also clearly leaving Ethelenns domain

rsulfuratus — Today at 5:51 PM

right. it has many cultural similarities to Tyrwingha but doesn't have the same fey connection which has a big impact

potentially in part settled by Tyrwinghans who didn't want to be part of Ethlenn's bargain

Deciusmus — Today at 5:51 PM

It might have originally been something of a frontier perhaps even a place of exile / banishment from Tyrwingha. Somewhat dangerous and with fey in the Darkwood on the southern border

Right the rejection of the bargain could work as well

rsulfuratus — Today at 5:52 PM

post-Drankor, my image of the vibe is kind of like the Dendarii Mountains in the Miles books, although without the implication of technological backwardness and the kind of dumb hill people stereotypes

but a rough place that was the center of guerilla fighting during several post-Drankor, pre-Great War wars (e.g., Avatus), but never conquered and proud of it

then, the same thing repeats during the hobgoblin wars. it is never conquered, but especially during the 3rd hobgoblin war it is completely isolated from Sembara

Deciusmus — Today at 5:53 PM

Yeah I like that

Right

Honestly there isn’t really any reason it ever has to have been part of sembara

It might work better if it was simply always an independent frontier type place

rsulfuratus — Today at 5:55 PM

yeah that's true

Deciusmus — Today at 5:56 PM

A backwater Drankorian province in the hills that was mostly known for the Darkwood in the south

Avatus never conquerors it but probes and maybe does some damage/marches through

But during the Avatus-Great War period is closely aligned with sembara and there are lots of back and forth

Then during the more recent hobgoblin wars it becomes more isolated again

rsulfuratus — Today at 5:58 PM

right, I think that makes sense. it might have a similar history to e.g. Vostok, in that during the height of the power of the Deriks the earl of adderfell swears personal fealty to Derik (as an underking type thing)

but then post Great War it quickly departs the Sembaran orbit

Deciusmus — Today at 5:59 PM

And in the last 150 years has developed kinda independently with a bit of a “these are our hills “ vibe

rsulfuratus — Today at 6:00 PM

yeah, especially until the final defeat of the hobgoblins in the 1650s it was repeatedly isolated from Sembara. and then even again e.g. during the undead crisis in your current campaign it would be the natural response of the people of Addermarch to retreat to the hills

## Life in Addermarch

So far just notes

### Culture and Religion

- Mos Numena, of the Sembaran flavor, pretty standard
- Speak Sembaran (southern)
- Largely independent hardy folks; travel is hard, the fey to the south will steal your dreams, and people have to look out for each other and be careful
- Only real city is Adderfell; some smaller towns (Tygate, to the south; Dunwick, to the north; and more that need names/placements), but most people live in small villages or homesteads
- Fairly insular. Some halflings travel to Adderfell, especially for the brandy, and plenty of travel cross-border with Tyrwingha. But less exchange with Sembara than one might think (Maseau Escarpment isolates a fair bit). More contacts with elves than might be expected due to proximity to Orenlas. 

### Political Organization, Justice, and the Law

%% ALL very much in draft form %%

Organized as a kingdom. There are five earls, each of whom has a circuit they are responsible for (with some quirks). The earls choose one of their own as the overking, whose original role was to serve as the commander of the army in times of war, and head of state in times of peace; much of this remains true. The overking also levies taxes to pay for the construction and upkeep of the southern forts that guard against the plaguelands. 

The five earls are each responsible for administering justice and providing for the defense of their territory, and have the right to tax the labor of the land within their circuit. Most (but see below) have no fixed residence, and travel among manors and castles within their domain. Earls tax their land to maintain defenses, but generally speaking there is no manorial feudalism in Addermarch. Earls appoint knights or castellans to serve as lord of particular castles, but there is no expectation that this title is inherited, and the knights/castellans are functionally part of the earl's court and not entitled to tax the land on their own (although often there are significant land holdings associated with particular castles, the profits of which would normally accure to the earl, but which might be deeded to a knight)

The earls are:
- Earl of Adderfell is considered an earl (and is often a powerful one) but unlike most other earls, functions as the lord of the city of Adderfell as their primary duty.
- The earl of the southern reaches is responsible for the nearly the entire southern border region and the upper reaches of the aure
- The earl of the aure is responsible for the north and eastern parts of the Aure River valley
- The earl of the highlands is responsible for the tyrwinghan border region 
- The earl of the mostreve is responsible for the mostreve escarpment, the northern border with sembara, and the western parts of the aure river valley; unlike other earls, this earl is responsible for three shires (name temporary) that are each centered around particular fortifications and whose lords serve as vassals of the earl, dating from various wars when the western border (and often the northern border) was fraught

Note these circuits are not strict lines on a map and often overlap, but each village is part of the domain of a single earl. There are also complicated divisions about things like roads, rights to charge tolls, etc, etc. 

In 1740s, I think the earl of the aure is the overking
### Economy, Trade, and Foreign Relations

Major exports are timber, wool, apple brandy, maybe leather or other animal products. Except for brandy, mostly raw materials.
