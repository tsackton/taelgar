Nestled in the [[Mostreve Hills]] southwest of [[Tyrwingha]], east of the [[Duchy of Maseau]], south of the [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]], and north of the haunted [[Darkwood]] lies the ancient hill kingdom of Addermarch. This is a land of rolling hills, swift rivers, and dense forests; a rugged land of independent folk fiercely proud of their long history and ancient traditions. 

Addermarch was settled long ago, before the [[Drankorian Empire|Drankorians]] came, by a people sharing a cultural and linguistic tradition with [[Tyrwingha]]. During the [[Drankorian Era]], it was a backwater province of the [[Drankorian Empire]], never densely settled, but supported and garrisoned as a ward against the dangers of the [[Darkwood]]. 

%% Possibility: original settlers may have included a substantial number of exiles from Tyrwingha, or people who rejected Ethlenn's bargain, which may color the perception of the fey in Addermarch. %%

With the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], Addermarch charted its own course as a frontier kingdom, isolated from [[Sembara]] by poor roads, difficult travel, and occasionally war. While sharing a language, a religion, and a cultural connection, Addermarch has never acknowledged the sovereignty of Sembaran monarches, excepting during the height of the [[House of Sewick]] in the years leading to the [[Great War]]. 

%% Note: Addermarch was never conquered in the wars since the fall of Drankor. It was isolated completely from [[Sembara]] during the height of the [[Dominion of Avatus]], although never cut off from [[Tyrwingha]]; it was besieged to the south but never entered during the [[Great War]]; and it was largely isolated except for dangerous passage along the [[Aure]] during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]]. 

Leaving in for now that Addermarch earls acknowledged [[Derik I]] as their overking, which lasted until the death of [[Derik III]]. 
%%

Now, Addermarch is a land of small farmers, foresters, and sheepherders, known primarily for its famed apple brandy that is traded downriver into [[Sembara]], but also a significant producer of timber and wool. Enjoying favorable tariffs for its goods in exchange for its role in protecting Sembaraâ€™s southern borders, Addermarch is a close ally of Sembara.

%% Not sure about the last sentence, might not fit the vibe. Although it probably should be a close ally of Sembaran post hobgoblin wars %%

## Geography 

*See more: [[Mostreve Hills]]*

Addermarch is a hill country, set entirely within the [[Mostreve Hills]]. The western parts of the kingdom are steep, rocky, and dominated by massive escarpments dropping to the Maseau plains and the [[Maseau Gap]], while the central regions of the kingdom are a mix of rolling hills, forests, and small river valleys, the largest and most significant of which is the [[Aure]] valley. Addermarch itself is approximately 23,000 square miles. %% bigger than Wales, a litter smaller than Ireland %%
### Climate

Most of Addermarch has hot and humid summers, with plenty of rain, and mild winters with relatively little snow. However, there is considerable variation, with the higher elevations frequently getting significant winter snowfall. 

%% Roughly parallel to mid-Atlantic Appalachians %%
### Regions

%% DRAFT and might change once I make a better map. Also all names are tentative %%

Addermarch is roughly divided into four major geographic regions:
- To the west and northwest, the [[Westcliff]] is a region of rough hills and some mountains that borders the flat plains of the Maseau Gap. This is a hard land with few people. This area was extensively fortified at multiple times in the past, but the castles in the hills have not all been maintained and many are now in ruins. %% very mountainous, steep cliffs, maybe Provence-like? white mountains %%
- The center of the realm is the [[Aure]] river valley, a land of rolling hills, forests, and many rivers that cut through the hills. This region is the most densely settled, and includes [[Adderfell]], the only real city in Addermarch. This is also the major agricultural land in Addermarch, and the center of brandy production. The [[Aure]] is navigable from [[Adderfell]] to the [[Enst]], and many riverboats ply their trade along it. %% Shenandoah/Blue Hills, Susquehana river valley%%
- To the south and east of the [[Aure]] valley are several lines of wooded hills and mountains, rising gradually to the height of land on the eaves of the [[Darkwood]]. This region is well-guarded, and lightly populated, mostly with smallholds of foresters and furriers. %% also mid-Atlantic Appalachians but very wooded%%
- To the east and northeast, along the borders of [[Tyrwingha]], the poor soil of the hilly, rocky land keeps forests to sheltered valleys. This is largely rangeland: sheep and cattle graze in the high pastures in summer, and only in a few sheltered valleys do crops survive. %% more open meadows, less forests, perhaps also a bit Provence-ish? Note the northern/eastern slopes are more wooded than the southern/western slopes%%
### Borders

To the west and northwest Addermarch is bordered by the [[Westcliff]], a series of sharp cliffs and dangerous terrain that separates the realm from the flat plains of the [[Duchy of Maseau]] to the west, and the [[Borderlands|Sembaran borderlands]] to the north. 

To the north and east, Addermarch is bordered by [[Tyrwingha]], although in many places this border

Moving east, the northern border cuts across the [[Aure]] river valley, and then turns south, where the border between [[Tyrwingha]] and Addermarch -- rarely tracked or marked -- runs along the gentle wooded hills that gradually rise to higher peaks.

To the south, Addermarch is bordered by the [[Darkwood]] and the [[Plaguelands]], and this border is carefully watched for fear of what might creep out in the shadows. 

## History

Addermarch was settled long ago, by a people closely related to the ancient Tyrwinghans. Before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], [[Tyrwingha]] and Addermarch were part of a shared patchwork of petty kingdoms, settled in the highlands of the [[Mostreve Hills]] above the great, ancient lizardfolk swamps of the lowlands. However, Addermarch is outside the boundaries of the [[Archfey Ethlenn]]'s influence, and as Tyrwingha grew closer to the fey, the fate of the two realms diverged. 

%% [[A Synthesis of Humanity in Greater Sembara]]; also consider possibility that many early settlers to Addermarch are explicitly exiles from Tyrwingha, or people who reject the deal with Ethlenn %%

After the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], as the [[Drankorian Empire]] grew to the south, dark things also crept into the woods to the south, no longer guarded or watched so closely by the elves, and the great forests on the southern slopes of the [[Mostreve Hills]] became known as the [[Darkwood]]. The people of Addermarch built standing stones to protect against incursions from the [[Feywild]], and watched their borders closely. 

%% exact timing left a bit unclear but the implication is that Drankor comes some relatively short time after the [[Darkwood]] becomes dark, and perhaps are welcomed as protectors to a certain extent. this is tied to [[Lord Umbraeth]] and the growth of [[Duskmire]] but details are not clearly worked out yet %%

During this time, Addermarch is incorporated into the [[Drankorian Empire]] as a minor province, and the city of [[Adderfell]] grows significantly, from a small village at the height of navigation of the [[Aure]] to a substantial urban center. The Drankorians, too, fortify the southern borders, and keep a close watch on the [[Darkwood]], but Addermarch remains lightly settled. 

%% Drankorians probably build a road along the Aure, to supply border forts beyond the height of navigation, but there are not a lot of Drankorian cities here %%

The fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] is little noticed in Addermarch at first, although it soon becomes a dangerous time as the Drankorian wizards that once guarded against incursions from the [[Darkwood]] slowly decline in number and effectiveness. During this time, as to the north the six duchies of [[Sembara]] are becoming established, Addermarch, despite suffering a series of upheavals, develops many of the governance traditions that still guide the realm. In the DR 1300s, threat of the [[Dominion of Avatus]] grows on the western borders of Addermarch. The Maseau Escarpment is heavily fortified, and a series of skirmishes are fought to a stalemate.

%% Leaving the details intentionally vague, but the basic idea is between 1059 - 1300 or so, you have a variety of conflicts, both external and self-inflicted, out of which emerges the current system of an "elected" overking from among the earls who serves as the commander in chief and head of state. The idea is that Addermarch is pretty war-torn during this time, and very isolated, with both external wars and some power grabs / internal wars between earls. The idea is that the threat of the [[Dominion of Avatus]] drives a lot of unification within Addermarch and ends a long unsettled period where there is often not really a sens of Addermarch as a single kingdom but rather a series of petty earldoms. Possibly part of the compromise here is to strip vassals from the earls (or most earls, except the earl of the west who needs vassals to protect against Avatus, but there probably never were hard borders anyway and they are not established now. %%

This long stasis shifts dramatically when [[Avatus]] invades [[Sembara]] in the early 1400s. Addermarch is nearly completely surrounded, kept from defeat only by the valiant efforts of guerilla warbands fighting in the rough hills of the escarpment. 

%% Possibility is that the guerilla troops - something like Faramir's bands in the LoTR, are one of the forerunners[[The Rangers| to the Ran]]gers %%

When [[Derik I]] marches at the head of the combined armies of [[Sembara]] and [[Tyrwingha]], the earls of Addermarch quickly join, and in support of the war establish [[Derik I]] as the overking of Addermarch. Over the next hundred years or so, a close relationship between Addermarch and [[Sembara]] develops. While the earls of Addermarch never become vassals of the Sembaran crown, when [[Derik I]] dies, [[Derik II]] is acknowledged as overking of Addermarch, a tradition that continues through the reigns of [[Charlotte I]] and [[Derik III]]. During the [[Great War]], the armies of [[Sembara]] and Addermarch fight together as one. 

%% The intention here is that Addermarch fits into the "Greater Sembara" narrative of the pre-Great-War years as basically a close ally; Sembara never has any meaningful role in the internal affairs of Addermarch -- Addermarch doesn't have a strong monarch in any case -- but functionally for "defense against monsters and evil" the Sembaran monarch is the boss. I think Sembara probably also contributes funds towards building fortifications and repairing fortifications along the Darkwood in this time as well. But, once Derik III dies, this all kind of falls apart. Possibly made worse by Sembara's relative lack of aid in the various plaguelands dangers that hit Addermarch hard.%%

After the [[Great War]], Addermarch suffers during the chaos of the early part of the [[Blood Years]]. After Derik III's death, neither [[Bertram I]] nor [[Jane of Tollen]] are not acknowledged as overking (in part because in Addermarch there is no real concept of regency, in part because they are seen as out of touch with the dangers of the [[Plaguelands]]), and Addermarch turns inward. The next forty years are a dark time, plagued with constant threats from the Plaguelands. 

%% Details are thin, but the intent here is that this sets up (a) growing influence of Rangers and the Addermarch style of guerilla fighting on the southern border, (b) growing distance from Sembara  which is seen as consumed by internal bickering and its western borders, and too willing to let the southern kingdoms ([[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]], Addermarch, and to a lesser extent [[Tyrwingha]]) bear the brunt of the defense against the terrors of the [[Plaguelands]], and (c) set up the central government as growing stronger and with some rearranging of taxes so that there is a bit more of an idea of a common defense (e.g., perhaps the overking and/or the council of earls has the right to levy particular taxes for the purposes of funding the common defense). %%

During the [[Second Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]], Addermarch and [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] form a close alliance, and Addermarch is the first to send aid when war breaks out. After the war, Addermarch is left with the Shattered Ice hobgoblins occupying much of the land directly northwest of it, and the fortifications in the Maseau Escarpment are repaired and reinforced. During the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]], Addermarch again marches in alliance with Sembara, but unlike during the [[Great War]], neither [[Arryn II]] nor [[Cece I]] are acknowledged as the overking of Addermarch. 

%% Part of the vibe here is that Addermarch potentially felt a bit betrayed by the treaty that ended the Second Hobgoblin War, which left Addermarch significantly more isolated than it was before the war started. Probably Sembara didn't have much choice as the war was, at best, a stalemate, but realistically people are irrational and so the idea that distant Sembaran royalty doesn't have the best interests of Addermarch at heart probably gets solidified here. This is in contrast to the [[Great War]] years, when Sembara and Derik I was seen as the savior of Addermarch freeing the realm from constant conflict with Avatus. %%

When peace finally comes with the defeat of the [[Shattered Ice Clan]] in DR 1653, the borders of Addermarch are (relatively) safe for the first time in 300 years. The second half of the 1600s is a time of rapid growth in Addermarch. [[Adderfell]] grows, and many of the brandy houses are founded during this time. Roads are repaired, and river traffic on the [[Aure]] grows significantly. The [[Darkwood]] still looms, but these are golden years, a time of peace and prosperity. 

In these golden years last until DR 1720, when the [[Undead Attacks in Sembara]] break out. While Addermarch is not heavily affected by undead itself, the [[Enst]] valley suffers a great deal, and once again the people of Addermarch refortify. In the modern day, Addermarch remains watchful. The generation that came of age during the zombie attacks, now the earls and knights of the realm, have not forgotten.

%% this is a little undeveloped and needs input on current events from Taelgar 1720, plus recent Sembaran history which is currently non-existent. however, basic vibe is that 1650-1720 was a period of rapid growth, economic development, and a time when resources went to roads and cities not castles and forts. since the zombie attacks, things are a bit more balanced and people don't forget, so current day is not exactly the "golden age" vibe but also not the "isolated guerilla warriors of the 1600-1650" period. %%

## Places

Will eventually replace with table, this is for notes / planning. Will be clearer with a map.

Natural features include:
- The [[Westcliff]], a significant escarpment running along the western and northwestern borders, steep hills, rough terrain, some relatively impassible mountain ridges here and sharp cliffs on the western border
- [[Darkwood]], to the south, haunted and fey-associated, colocated with the center of [[Duskmire]] in the [[Feywild]]
- [[Torvaine Forest]], centered at mid and high elevations around the upper [[Umber]] and [[~Main Aure Fork~]], and stretching in places into the lowlands. 
- Another small forest on the northern part of the western border with [[Tyrwingha]]
- A region of higher mountains and alpine meadows on the southern part of the [[Tyrwingha]] border
- [[Shadowmere]], a boggy lowlands on the western edge of the [[Darkwood]], also considered haunted
- [[Aure]] river valley, including the [[Aure]], which forms a lake + waterfall at [[Adderfell]], and 2-4 major tributaries with their own minor rivers (this is the only watershed in Addermarch)

Settlements include:
- [[Adderfell]], the largest settlement and only city in Addermarch, at the height of navigation of the [[Aure]], center of apple farming and brandy production
- [[Tygate]], a small market town near the southern border
- [[Dunwick]], a small market town in the western part of the [[Aure|Aure river]] valley
- [[Valcroix]], a market town at the confluence of the [[Umber]] and [[~Main Aure Fork~ ]]rivers
- [[Roscombe]], a market town in the northwestern highlands, near [[Torvaine Forest]]
- [[Brantor]], a village near [[Roscombe]]

## Life in Addermarch

So far just notes

### Culture and Religion

- [[Mos Numena]], of the Sembaran flavor, pretty standard
- Speak Sembaran (southern)
- Largely independent hardy folks; travel is hard, the fey to the south will steal your dreams, and people have to look out for each other and be careful
- Only real city is [[Adderfell]]; some smaller market towns, but most people live in small villages or homesteads
- Fairly insular. Some halflings travel to Adderfell, especially for the brandy, and plenty of travel cross-border with Tyrwingha. But less exchange with Sembara than one might think (Maseau Escarpment isolates a fair bit). More contacts with elves than might be expected due to proximity to Orenlas. 

### Political Organization, Justice, and the Law

%% ALL very much in draft form %%

Organized as a kingdom. There are five earls, each of whom has a circuit they are responsible for (with some quirks). The earls choose one of their own as the overking, whose original role was to serve as the commander of the army in times of war, and head of state in times of peace; much of this remains true. The overking also levies taxes to pay for the construction and upkeep of the southern forts that guard against the plaguelands. 

The five earls are each responsible for administering justice and providing for the defense of their territory, and have the right to tax the labor of the land within their circuit. Most (but see below) have no fixed residence, and travel among manors and castles within their domain. Earls tax their land to maintain defenses, but generally speaking there is no manorial feudalism in Addermarch. Earls appoint knights or castellans to serve as lord of particular castles, but there is no expectation that this title is inherited, and the knights/castellans are functionally part of the earl's court and not entitled to tax the land on their own (although often there are significant land holdings associated with particular castles, the profits of which would normally accure to the earl, but which might be deeded to a knight)

The earls are:
- Earl of Adderfell is considered an earl (and is often a powerful one) but unlike most other earls, functions as the lord of the city of Adderfell as their primary duty.
- The earl of the southern reaches is responsible for the nearly the entire southern border region and the upper reaches of the aure
- The earl of the aure is responsible for the north and eastern parts of the Aure River valley
- The earl of the highlands is responsible for the tyrwinghan border region 
- The earl of the mostreve is responsible for the mostreve escarpment, the northern border with sembara, and the western parts of the aure river valley; unlike other earls, this earl is responsible for three shires (name temporary) that are each centered around particular fortifications and whose lords serve as vassals of the earl, dating from various wars when the western border (and often the northern border) was fraught

Note these circuits are not strict lines on a map and often overlap, but each village is part of the domain of a single earl. There are also complicated divisions about things like roads, rights to charge tolls, etc, etc. 

In 1740s, I think the earl of the aure is the overking
### Economy, Trade, and Foreign Relations

Major exports are timber, wool, apple brandy, maybe leather or other animal products. Except for brandy, mostly raw materials.
