Nestled in the [[Mostreve Hills]] southwest of [[Tyrwingha]], east of the [[Duchy of Maseau]], south of the [[Borderlands|Sembaran Borderlands]], and north of the haunted [[Darkwood]] lies the ancient hill kingdom of Addermarch. This is a land of rolling hills, swift rivers, and dense forests; a rugged land of independent folk fiercely proud of their long history and ancient traditions. 

Addermarch was settled long ago, before the [[Drankorian Empire|Drankorians]] came, by a people sharing a cultural and linguistic tradition with [[Tyrwingha]]. During the [[Drankorian Era]], it was a backwater province of the [[Drankorian Empire]], never densely settled, but supported and garrisoned as a ward against the dangers of the [[Darkwood]]. 

%% Possibility: original settlers may have included a substantial number of exiles from Tyrwingha, or people who rejected Ethlenn's bargain, which may color the perception of the fey in Addermarch. %%

With the fall of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], Addermarch charted its own course as a frontier kingdom, isolated from [[Sembara]] by poor roads, difficult travel, and occasionally war. While sharing a language, a religion, and a cultural connection, Addermarch has never acknowledged the sovereignty of Sembaran monarches, excepting during the height of the [[House of Sewick]].

%% Note: Addermarch was never conquered in the wars since the fall of Drankor. It was isolated completely from Sembara during the height of the [[Dominion of Avatus]], although never cut off from [[Tyrwingha]]; it was besieged to the south but never entered during the [[Great War]]; and it was largely isolated except for dangerous passage along the [[Aure]] during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)]]. 

Leaving in for now that Addermarch earls acknowledged Derik I as their overking, which lasted until the death of Derik III.

Now, Addermarch is a land of small farmers, foresters, and sheepherders, known primarily for its famed apple brandy that is traded downriver into Sembara, but also a significant producer of timber and wool. Enjoying favorable tariffs for its goods in exchange for its role in protecting Sembaraâ€™s southern borders, Addermarch is a close ally of Sembara.

%% Not sure about the last sentence, might not fit the vibe. Although it probably should be a close ally of Sembaran post hobgoblin wars %%
