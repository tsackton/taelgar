%% fey gate notes from Discord:

 in this case, the set up was that there were two crystals (presumably originally from the feywild) that served as "anchors" on the material plane  one had be damaged, and so the gate couldn't function as it was no longer properly anchored

The Kilrath Standing Stones are a ring of weather‑worn megaliths set on a low hill in southern [[Addermarch]]. Lichens and knife‑marks cover the stones; in mist the circle seems larger than it is, and birds avoid alighting within. Local tales insist the hill is a meeting place for old powers and that oaths sworn there bind tighter than iron.

## The Circle
The surviving uprights describe an uneven ring with a toppled lintel near the east. Traces of ancient carving—mostly eroded—suggest an origin predating Sembaran rule. The barrows and field walls nearby attest to long settlement of the surrounding land.

## Rumor and Caution
Shepherds avoid the circle after sundown and warn strangers not to sleep on the hill. Stories speak of lights between the stones and of travelers who wake to find their camp moved a dozen paces without a footprint to show how.

DM notes and campaign references
- Discord notes describe the stones as anchors for a damaged fey gate; one anchor broken, preventing stable passage. Treat this as DM‑facing lore, not public knowledge in‑world.
