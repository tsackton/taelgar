The Kilrath Standing Stones are a ring of weather‑worn megaliths set on a low hill in the [[Stonewolds]] of western [[Carlinshire]]. Lichens and knife‑marks cover the stones; in mist the circle seems larger than it is, and birds avoid alighting within. Local tales insist the hill is a meeting place for old powers, or a warning of dangers from the [[Feywild]]. The surviving uprights describe an uneven ring with a toppled lintel near the east. Traces of ancient carving, mostly eroded, suggest an ancient origin, predating the Drankorian Empire.

DM notes and campaign references
- Discord notes describe the stones as anchors for a damaged fey gate; one anchor broken, preventing stable passage. Treat this as DM‑facing lore, not public knowledge in‑world.

in this case, the set up was that there were two crystals (presumably originally from the feywild) that served as "anchors" on the material plane  one had be damaged, and so the gate couldn't function as it was no longer properly anchored
