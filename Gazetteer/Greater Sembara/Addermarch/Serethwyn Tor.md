Serethwyn Tor is an old hill‑fort in western [[Carlinshire]], built on a rocky rise of the [[Westcliff]] overlooking the [[Highmoor]]. While its full history is obscure, it likely served as a major garrison and forward command post for the armies of the [[Avatus]] during his wars with Addermarch. The site was deliberately dismantled and sealed after Addermarch's victory by [[The Rangers]], and commanded to be left undisturbed. In the early DR 1700s, it is occasionally patrolled by Rangers to ensure it remains abandoned and sealed.
