# The Torvaine Forest

The Torvaine Forest is a broad belt of mixed woodland in central [[Addermarch]], a tangle of oak and fir threaded by game paths and woodcutters’ trails. The forest supplies timber and charcoal to the upland shires, and shelters old stones and barrows from earlier ages beneath its leaf‑carpeted rises.

One major road cuts through the forest, connecting [[Valcroix]] in the river valleys to the highland town of [[Roscombe]]. The road is protected by [[Torvaine Watch]], and well-maintained, but is frequently impassable due to heavy snow or mud between December and May. 

Most settlements in the forest lie along the [[Umber]] river valley, or along the forest's southern edges north of the [[Velan]].
