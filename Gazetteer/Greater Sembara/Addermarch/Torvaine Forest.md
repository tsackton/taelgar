# The Torvaine Forest

The Torvaine Forest is a broad belt of mixed woodland in central [[Addermarch]], a tangle of oak and fir threaded by game paths and woodcutters’ trails. The forest supplies timber and charcoal to the upland shires, and shelters old stones and barrows from earlier ages beneath its leaf‑carpeted rises.

## Boundaries and Use
Villages along the margins manage coppice lots and commons according to customary rights. Foresters warn against over‑cutting near ancient markers where the forest has a “long memory.”

## Folklore
Travelers trade stories of strange music under the boughs after rain and of beasts that know when roads are safest. Such tales are part of the March’s larger tradition of wary respect for its woods.
