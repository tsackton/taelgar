The Valenfray Hills form a broken east–west line of gentle, rolling hills between the [[Aure]] and the [[Maerwyn Mountains]], partially separating [[Addermarch]] from the [[Darkwood]]. Their western stretches are lightly forested, with the northwestern slopes often settled by foresters. The higher ground toward the [[Maerwyn Mountains|Maerwyns]] is rougher and cut by sharp ravines. The ridge line is heavily fortified, guarding Addermarch’s southern border against the [[Plaguelands]] and the Darkwood.
