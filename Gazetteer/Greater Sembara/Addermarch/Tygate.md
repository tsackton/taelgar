Tygate is a small market town near the southern sources of the [[Aure]], set against the edge of the [[Darkwood]]. Its position makes it a last provisioning point before entering the forest or a first safe haven on the way out. Timber, resin, and pelts flow north through Tygate. A wooden palisade protects the town, with several watchtowers keeping a wary eye on the forest and wildlands to the south. 

The main road from Adderfell passes through Tygate before turning southwest to supply [[Darkwood Keep]] on the frontier.
