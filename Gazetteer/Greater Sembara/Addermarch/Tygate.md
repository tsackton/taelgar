%% near the source of the Aure, close to Darkwood. details in OneNote from original Plaguelands campaign %%

Tygate is a small market town near the southern sources of the [[Aure]], set against the edge of the [[Darkwood]]. Its position makes it a last provisioning point before entering the forest or a first safe haven on the way out. Timber, resin, and pelts flow north through Tygate; in return it receives tools, salt, and cloth.

## Setting
Palisades and watchtowers keep a wary eye on the treeline. The lanes smell of pine pitch and wet bark. A simple chapel serves foresters and carters who make offerings before risky journeys.

## Risks and Routes
When the Darkwood grows restless, Tygate’s roads empty and caravans detour toward [[Adderfell]]. In steadier times, monthly fairs draw trappers and hillfolk for barter and news.

DM notes and campaign references
- Early Addermarch outlines frame Tygate as a flashpoint for refugees and border trouble (see OneNote “Plaguelands” notes, e.g., Refugees.md). Use those specifics as scenario seeds; the article remains general.
