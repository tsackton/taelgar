Darkwood Keep is a frontier fortress on the southern edge of [[Addermarch]], raised to watch the forest eaves of the [[Darkwood]] and the approaches from the [[Plaguelands]]. The road from [[Adderfell]] passes through [[Tygate]] before turning southwest to supply the keep and the smaller works that guard the border.
