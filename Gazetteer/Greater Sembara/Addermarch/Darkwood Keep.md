# Darkwood Keep

Darkwood Keep is a frontier fortress on the southern edge of [[Addermarch]], raised to watch the forest eaves of the [[Darkwood]] and the approaches from the [[Plaguelands]]. The road from [[Adderfell]] passes through [[Tygate]] before turning southwest to supply the keep and the smaller works that guard the border.

## DM notes

- The keep is referenced as the most important of Addermarch’s southern fortifications: see [[Addermarch]] and [[Tygate]].
- The `_dm_notes/_Plaguelands` materials contain campaign-era details, maps, and encounter planning for the keep and the surrounding frontier (useful starting points: [[Southern Addermarch - Gazetteer]], [[Plaguelands Campaign NPCs]], and [[Tracking Undead]]).
