# The Stonewolds

>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

The Stonewolds are rugged, wooded hills west of [[Roscombe]]. Thickets and drystone ridges hide narrow tracks frequented by trappers, hermits, and monsters alike. The western reaches shelter cave mouths that sometimes drop into the deeper underways.
## Notable Sites
- [[Fontwick]], a tiny dairy-farming village on the settled eastern edge of the Stonewolds
- [[Kilrath Caves]] and [[Kilrath Standing Stones]], fey-tinged locales
- [[West Stonewolds Caves]], a vertical descent into lightless caverns.  
- Hermit haunts, such as campsites like those used by [[Norman the Wanderer]].

%% DM: Travel cues and “these are my hills” hermit guidance, ogre and wolf at the cave mouth, and the rappel into darkness are outlined in [[Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark|Adventure 4 - Into the Underdark]]. %%
