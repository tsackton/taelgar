Haldrenn is a ridge‑top hill village in the [[Highmoor]], northeast of [[Brantor]] and [[Roscombe]], known for shieling herds, run‑rig fields, and a spring that runs red after heavy rain.
## Overview
Haldrenn clings to a eastern side of a windswept ridge northwest of the [[Umber]] lowlands, its turf‑roofed houses and ankle‑high drystone dykes gathered around a spring‑fed well. Each spring, herders drive shaggy highland cattle up to summer shielings while crofters tend rye and kale on the eastern slope. After storms, the iron‑rich “Red‑Soil Spring” stains the brook crimson. 

## Layout
The main village consists of 11  houses and a small temple to [[The Mother]] around the communal well.  To the south, strips of arable land are farmed in rotation, providing sustenance crops of rye, barley, and kale for the village; two rowan-fringed orchards are nestled in sheltered hollows. North are the summer pastures, with dairy pens and shieling bothies. The west hollow, towards [[Brantor]], has a coppice wood with charcoal clamps. 

The people of [[Haldrenn]] traditionally place carved wooden wards on the ridge lines, especially to the east, that are rumored to deter hostile fey. 
## Economy
- Transhumance (spring–autumn): cattle families make high‑fat cheeses and other dairy products for buyers in [[Roscombe]].  
- Wool & hides: blackface sheep on common hill; fleeces and tallow at [[Roscombe]] fairs.  
- Subsistence arable: rye, barley, kale, and rowan‑flower honey.  
- Winter trades: charcoal burns and pit‑sawn boards hauled south when roads firm.

## Notable Events
- (DR:: 1715-05-07): A maddening "song" starts driving cattle and other animals to violence; the farmer [[Olay]] gored by his own bull.
- (DR:: 1715-05-17): [[Drou]], [[Fazoth de Brune|Fazoth]], and [[Yvan Greenrabbit|Yvan]] arrive in the village and [[Addermarch - Session 11|help with a lost girl]] and a [[Addermarch - Session 12|worg attack]].

Bee Cave: shallow cavern east of the village where [[Rowena]] hid from angry bees.  

Setup for “Fey Incursion” ties Haldrenn to animal madness and a Singing Tree linked to [[Morlaith]]; Caradoc cues the hook in Roscombe (see [[Adventure 5 - Fey Incursion|Adventure 5 - Fey Incursion]]). Session details in [[Addermarch - Session 11]] and [[Addermarch - Session 12]].
