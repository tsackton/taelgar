Weskershire is a rural shire of western [[Addermarch]], a patchwork of hill farms, hedgerows, and small woodlots bounded by low stone walls. Its villages gather around greens where sheep are brought for shearing and barter, and its lanes meet at simple market crosses rather than large town squares.

Modest shrines, a reeve’s hall, and a few outlying quarries round out the landscape. The shire’s reputation is for steady flocks and steady folk; politics tends to follow the harvest rather than distant court fashions.
