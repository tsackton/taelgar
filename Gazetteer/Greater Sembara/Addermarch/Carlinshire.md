Carlinshire is the largest of the three shires that owe allegiance to the Earl of the Mostreve, and is contains the upper stretches of the [[Umber]], the higher elevations of [[Torvaine Forest]], and the northern part of the [[Westcliff]]. It is bordered by the [[Maseau Gap]] on the west, [[Bramshire]] to the north, the [[Aure]] valley to the east, and [[Weskershire]] to the south. 

This area saw heavy fighting during the war against the [[Dominion of Avatus]], and was the only region of [[Addermarch]] to be partially occupied by [[Avatus]]. It is now a somewhat poor region, and rather neglected. 

The most significant settlement in [[Carlinshire]] is [[Valcroix]], at the confluence of the [[Umber]] and [[~Main Aure Fork~]]. Smaller settlements, mostly villages, ruined castles, and the occasional toll-fort, dot the hills to the west.
