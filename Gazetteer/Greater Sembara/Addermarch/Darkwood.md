The Darkwood is an ancient, brooding forest along the southern border of Addermarch, a place where old paths bend unexpectedly and twilight lingers beneath the boughs. The people of [[Addermarch]] speak of it in hushed tones, claiming it has been haunted by dangerous fey since even before humans settled this area in ancient days. While scholars cannot easily confirm or deny these claims, surviving Drankorian records clearly indicate even that mighty empire feared the Darkwood and fortified defenses on its fringes. Hunters and charcoal burners keep to the lighter, open woods on its fringes, and those who enter it, for good or ill, rarely return. 

Few have mapped the exact borders of the Darkwood, but it is generally considered to begin south and west of the [[Valenfray Hills]], extending into the [[Plaguelands]] for some unknown distance. To the west, the dismal swamps of [[Shadowmere]] separate the Darkwood from the mountainous terrain of the southern parts of [[Westcliff]].

DM notes and campaign references
- Longstanding ties to fey boundaries near the [[Sunset Gate]] and [[Duskmire]]; see design notes in Worldbuilding/External/discord-dm-log-through-20250116.txt for Umbraeth’s domain and boundary effects.
- Background of early Addermarch adventures, including ruins sometimes called “Darkwood Keep” (see _DM_/OneNote campaign outlines and zone notes).
- Treat in‑world details above as canonical geography; specific combats and PC outcomes remain campaign‑specific.
