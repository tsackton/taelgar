The Darkwood is an ancient, brooding forest along the southern rim of Addermarch, a place where old paths bend unexpectedly and twilight lingers beneath the boughs. Even before the modern era it held a fearful reputation; folk tales insist that the wood has been “the Darkwood” since Drankorian times for reasons no one now agrees upon. Hunters and charcoal burners keep to its edges, and those who must cross it choose the daylight and keep together.

## Geography and Boundaries
The Darkwood lies near the headwaters of the [[Aure]] and other upland streams, with dense evergreen stands broken by moss‑slick rock and sudden hollows. To the west and north, the wood brushes against the old fey boundary known as the [[Sunset Gate]], a line of power that runs toward the fen of [[Duskmire]]. In places the Gate twists the understory into colored glaives of bramble and thorn. The forest’s eastern edge opens toward Addermarch’s settled hills and the road toward [[Adderfell]].

## Nature of the Wood
Travelers report the sense of being watched, paths looping back upon themselves, and clearings that are not where they were hours before. Scholars with an interest in fey realms argue that the Darkwood overlaps an older dominion once granted to [[Umbraeth]], which would account for its capricious geometry and the occasional appearance of creatures not otherwise native to the March. Whether or not such claims are accurate, the wood is undeniably perilous.

## Sites and Rumors
Stories persist of a ruined keep half‑claimed by the forest and of hidden rings of stone older than Sembara. Wise folk caution that not all lantern light in the Darkwood comes from mortal hands, and that bargains offered under those boughs may carry a price.

## Travel and Safety
Only the most established tracks should be attempted, and never alone. Local guides are prized, and villages on the margins keep signal bells for the rare occasions when the wood pushes outward.
