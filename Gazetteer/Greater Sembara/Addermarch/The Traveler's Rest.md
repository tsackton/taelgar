# The Traveler's Rest
The Traveler’s Rest is Roscombe’s principal inn, a sturdy two‑storey house set against the southern wall near the gate from [[Valcroix]]. It offers clean beds, hot meals, and reliable stabling for caravans arriving over the ridge road. The common room doubles as neutral ground where drovers, merchants, and messengers trade news over supper.

Run by Bertrand LeBlanc—an affable, efficient host with a rumored connection to the Wanderer—the inn has a reputation for fair dealing and a well‑kept cellar. A small shrine‑niche by the hearth bears travelers’ tokens and wayfarers’ prayers.
