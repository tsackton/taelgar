## Topography and Major Features


## Civilizations and Cultures
This is a heavily peopled land. In the north, amongst the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], the [[Zimka]] people live the highlands of [[Zimkova]], and have formed three realms: [[Breva]], [[Lavnoch]], and [[Ardlas]]. South and east of the Zimkovan realms is [[Sembara]], a rich and powerful monarchy with a long history. Sembara is bordered to its south by the ancient fey-protected realm of [[Tyrwingha]], as well as the independent earldom of [[Addermarch]] and the [[Duchy of Maseau]]. To the east is the famous [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]] and past Tollen, the lightly populated coasts and forests of [[Vostok]].

There are two large and ancient lizardfolk settlements: [[Ozabal]], in the delta of the [[Wistel]], and [[Latazaro]], on the eastern borders of [[Tyrwingha]]. Beyond these settlements, lizardfolk are common along the river valleys. There are three major [[Dwarves|dwarven]] realms on the eastern borders, and dwarves are common in the human cities of Sembara, although there are no large, independent dwarven realms within Greater Sembara. Halflings are commonly seen plying their trade along the roads and rivers of the region, as well sailing across the [[Western Gulf]] and into the wider [[Green Sea]]. Although stoneborn are never common, they too are seen in the cities and coastlines of Sembara, although, like dwarves, there are no large stoneborn communities within the region.

## Climate
In general, the region’s climate is temperate, with four distinct seasons, dry winters, and wet summers. During the summer months, a monsoon wind blows from the Green Sea, bringing ample rainfall. In winter, high pressure builds over the northern steppe, and the west winds that blow over the mountains are dry and cold. 




Sembara is an ancient kingdom blessed with mild weather, amble rain, and rich fertile soil. Largely unchanged by the upheavals of the Great War, farmers plant winter wheat and summer millet and soybeans largely as they have for thousands of years. Five major river systems, fed by the summer rains, and melting snowpack and glaciers from the mountains, define the region: in the northeast, the Kem and Niva rivers spill down from the northern plateau across Vostok. Further west, the mighty Volta, wide and cold, flows past Tollen into the Green Sea. South of the Volta is the swift flowing Teft, then the placid Semb, and finally the southern Wistel and Enst rivers, which merge in the great marshy delta of ~LizardfolkSwamp~.

  

The rise and fall of the land further defines the region: in the west, the towering ~CentralMountai ns~ rise thousands of feet into the air. Few travelers cross these high peaks, save on the guarded underground roads of the dwarves. East of the mountains lie the Sembaran Highlands, a rough land that slowly descends to the Aine and Braebine Hills. East of the highlands is the Great Central Plain, a vast flat plain, stretching from the Mostreve Hills in the south to the Volta River in the north. North of the Teft, the plain stretches toward the mountains until the Northern Highlands start to rise up. In the west, the plain ends along the line of the Aine and Braebine Hills. In the east, it ends just east of the Volta River, as the land rises to the ~VostokHills~ before descending again to the  

#### Climatic Overview

The climate of Sembara is shaped by several major factors:

  

- In the summer, warm winds blow from the Green Sea, bringing heavy rain and muggy air
    
- In the winter, a high pressure system develops over the northern plateau, and the winds come from the west over the ~CentralMountains~. This is a cold and dry season.

In general, the region’s climate is temperate, with four distinct seasons, dry winters, and wet summers. During the summer months, a monsoon wind blows from the Green Sea, bringing ample rainfall. In winter, high pressure builds over the northern steppe, and the west winds that blow over the mountains are dry and cold. 



#### The Northern Plateau

On the southern edge of the steppe, the land rises to a plateau, bordered on the west by the ~CentralMountains~ and on the east by the ~VostokMountains~. In the east, ~UnnamedLake1~ and the Great North Wall dominate the plateau. In the west, the glacial-fed headwaters of the Volta pour down off the highlands in the spring.

  

Rising to several thousand feet in the central regions, this plateau is cold and dry in the winter, and experiences a brief, wet summer in July and August as the warm winds from the Green Sea blow in. Much of the region is a land of short grasses although the landscape is dotted with stands of trees. Bison roam across much of the area and there is little agriculture, although cultivation of cold-weather grains such as barley is common in the western areas.

  

Spilling off the southern edge of plateau is a large band of mixed forest, with ancient redwoods towering over a mixed forest of pine, spruce, and elm. This forest band stretches from the Volta headwaters east to the coast near the Skaer Islands.

#### The Western Plateau

Starting from the Braebine and Aine Hills, the land rises to the north and west, forming a hilly, highland area rising towards the ~CentralMountains~. This land is wetter and warmer than the north, and rain falls regularly in the summer months. Little precipitation falls in the winter, although what does fall, falls as snow. 

#### The Central Plain

From central Vostok, 


he Western [[Green Sea]] region refers to the areas clustered around the [[Western Gulf]] and the more westerly parts of the [[Green Sea]].

The Western [[Green Sea]]  is dominated by the Kingdom of Sembara and Tyrwingha, a personal union of the two most important kingdoms, which dominates the political universe. North of Sembara lies Zimkova, the land of the Zimka people. In the far north of Zimkova are the traditionalists, loosely organized; but three kingdoms have also been established in Zimkova: Breva, near the [[Duchy of Arnsbury]], and Lavnoch and Ardlas to the north and south of long Lake Derwent at the headwaters of the River Semb. To the west, the high peaks of the [[Sentinel Range]] reach to the sky, forming an almost impassable boundary. To the east, the [[Green Sea]] beckons, and merchant ships ply its calm waters, carrying trade from [[Cymea]], a land of city-states and ancient wizardry, Skaegenland, the cold northern islands, home to the independent and proud Skaer people, and exotic lands further east.

Along the northeastern border of the Kingdom of Sembara runs the mighty Volta River, dividing Sembara from [[Vostok]], a land of many rivers, bitter winters, and small kingdoms. At the mouth of the Volta sits the Free City of [[Tollen]], an independent city-state known for its merchant guilds, scholarship, wizards, and free-wheeling culture, a blend of the fierce independence of the Skaer, the ancient learning of Drankor, and the commercial and mercantile prowess of the Sembaran Northlands.  

South of Sembara, beyond the Mostreve Hills lie the Plaguelands, a desolate and accursed land, still not recovered from an ancient curse.

South of the Volta is the swift flowing Teft, then the placid Semb, and finally the southern Wistel and Enst rivers, which merge in the great marshy delta of [[Ozabal]], home to a large community of Lizardfolk.

East of the highlands is the Great Central Plain, a vast flat plain, stretching from the Mostreve Hills in the south to the Volta River in the north. North of the Teft, the plain stretches toward the mountains until the Northern Highlands start to rise up. In the west, the plain ends along the line of the Aine and Braebine Hills. In the east, it ends just east of the Volta River, as the land rises to the [[~VostokHills~]] before descending again to the flatlands of central [[Vostok]].

The climate of the region is shaped by several major factors:

-   In the summer, warm winds blow from the [[Green Sea]], bringing heavy rain and muggy air   
-   In the winter, a high pressure system develops over the northern plateau, and the winds come from the west over the [[Sentinel Range]]. This is a cold and dry season.
-   The [[Green Sea]], in the east, provides a moderating influence, especially on the coastal plains.

In general, the region’s climate is temperate, with four distinct seasons, dry winters, and wet summers. During the summer months, a monsoon wind blows from the [[Green Sea]], bringing ample rainfall. In winter, high pressure builds over the northern steppe, and the west winds that blow over the mountains are dry and cold.

## Major Historical Eras


%%^Campaign:None%%
*Area:* This region includes [[Sembara]], [[Tollen]], [[Tyrwingha]], [[Addermarch]], and [[Vostok]].

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The culture and history are well developed as far back as the [[The Downfall|Downfall]]. [[Zimkova]] and [[Vostok]] are considerably less well developed than the remainder of the region, although large scale events that impact the rest of [[Greater Sembara]] have largely been developed.

*Non-Canonical Development:* Some open questions remain about history, and some details are only lightly sketched or not completely canonical. [[Vostok]] and [[Zimkova]] are generally not developed in detail, although canonical loose vibes exist for [[Zimkova]], at least. 

*Blank Regions:* The only thing that approaches a blank slate here is [[Vostok]] (and perhaps [[Zimkova]]), which has numerous brainstorming but minimal canonical detail.  Any development in this region needs to consider a significant amount of canonical history, geography, and culture. The [[Grastenvakt|Grastenvakt]], the wall across the north of Vostok, is intentionally left blank. 

*Adventures:* The [[Cleenseau Campaign]] and the Addermarch campaign are entirely set within this region, in southern Sembara and Addermarch respectively. The Dunmar Frontier campaign spent significant time in Tollen.
