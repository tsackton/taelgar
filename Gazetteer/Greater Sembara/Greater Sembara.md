# Greater Sembara
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`  
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

Greater Sembara is an ancient land blessed with mild weather, amble rain, and rich fertile soil. Largely unchanged by the upheavals of the [[Great War]], farmers plant winter wheat and summer millet and soybeans largely as they have for thousands of years. The rolling hills and fertile river valleys are dotted with small cities and prosperous market towns, and halflings traders ply the roads and waterways. This is a land defined by its rivers: the [[Kem]], [[Volta]], [[Teft]], [[Semb]], [[Wisford]], and [[Enst]] in particular.

Sembara is an ancient kingdom blessed with mild weather, amble rain, and rich fertile soil. Largely unchanged by the upheavals of the Great War, farmers plant winter wheat and summer millet and soybeans largely as they have for thousands of years. Five major river systems, fed by the summer rains, and melting snowpack and glaciers from the mountains, define the region: in the northeast, the Kem and Niva rivers spill down from the northern plateau across Vostok. Further west, the mighty Volta, wide and cold, flows past Tollen into the Green Sea. South of the Volta is the swift flowing Teft, then the placid Semb, and finally the southern Wistel and Enst rivers, which merge in the great marshy delta of [[Ozabal|Ozabal Swamp]].
  

The rise and fall of the land further defines the region: in the west, the towering ~CentralMountai ns~ rise thousands of feet into the air. Few travelers cross these high peaks, save on the guarded underground roads of the dwarves. East of the mountains lie the Sembaran Highlands, a rough land that slowly descends to the Aine and Braebine Hills. East of the highlands is the Great Central Plain, a vast flat plain, stretching from the Mostreve Hills in the south to the Volta River in the north. North of the Teft, the plain stretches toward the mountains until the Northern Highlands start to rise up. In the west, the plain ends along the line of the Aine and Braebine Hills. In the east, it ends just east of the Volta River, as the land rises to the ~VostokHills~ before descending again to the

## Civilizations and Cultures

This is a heavily peopled land. In the north, amongst the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], the [[Zimka]] people live a traditional life in the highlands of [[Zimkova]], and have formed three realms: [[Breva]], [[Lavnoch]], and [[Ardlas]]. South and east of the Zimkovan realms is [[Sembara]], a rich and powerful monarchy with a long history. Sembara is bordered to its south by the ancient fey-protected realm of [[Tyrwingha]], as well as the independent earldom of [[Addermarch]] and the [[Duchy of Maseau]], once under the suzeranity of Sembara, but now an independent land populated by refugees from the [[Isingue]] and the [[Plaguelands]]. To the east is the famous [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]] and past Tollen, the lightly populated coasts and forests of [[Vostok]].

There are two large and ancient lizardfolk settlements: [[Ozabal]], in the delta of the [[Wistel]], and [[Latazaro]], on the eastern borders of [[Tyrwingha]]. Beyond these settlements, lizardfolk are common along the river valleys. There are three major [[Dwarves|dwarven]] realms on the western borders, and dwarves are common in the human cities of Sembara, although there are no large, independent dwarven realms within Greater Sembara. Halflings are commonly seen plying their trade along the roads and rivers of the region, as well sailing across the [[Western Gulf]] and into the wider [[Green Sea]]. Although [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]] are never common, they too are seen in the cities of Sembara, although, like dwarves, there are no large stoneborn communities within the region.
## Climate
In general, the region’s climate is temperate, with four distinct seasons, dry winters, and wet summers. During the summer months, a monsoon wind blows from the [[Green Sea]], bringing ample rainfall. In winter, high pressure builds over the northern steppe, and the west winds that blow over the mountains are dry and cold. 

The climate of the region is shaped by several major factors:

-   In the summer, warm winds blow from the [[Green Sea]], bringing heavy rain and muggy air   
-   In the winter, a high pressure system develops over the northern plateau, and the winds come from the west over the [[Sentinel Range]]. This is a cold and dry season.
-   The [[Green Sea]], in the east, provides a moderating influence, especially on the coastal plains.

## Major Historical Eras
_See also [[Humanity in Greater Sembara]] and [[Timeline of Sembaran History]]_

When humans first came to this region it was already a thriving land, with the ancient elven forest of [[Alcarinque]] to the south, and the [[~Ancient Lizardfolk Swamp~]] filling what would become the [[Enst]] and [[Wistel]] river valleys. Halflings sailed the [[Green Sea]] to the east, and dwarves delved deep in [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]  to the west. In the years before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]] to cultures of humans met and mixed: the [[~Northerner~]], traveling east from the high passes over the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], and the [[~Mariners~]], sailing west from the [[Eastern Green Sea|far reaches of the Green Sea]]. From this melting pot, two distinct cultures emerged: the [[Zimka]], clinging to tradition in the north and the [[Tollen|Tollish]] culture, growing around the city of Tollen and the Sembaran coast. 

The Downfall changed the land, and dried out the [[~Ancient Lizardfolk Swamp~]] and when the devastation and chaos cleared,

## DM Notes and Meta
*Canonical Development and Constraints:* Sembara, Addermarch, Tollen, and Tyrwingha have substanial cultural, political, and historical development as far back as the Downfall. The entire region has a general historical arc, and the climate and geography are mostly well defined. Future development has a substantial body of canon to integrate with. There are two canonical religions in the area, Mos Numena, and the kestavo tradition, both with substantial development, although much of the kestavo material has not been introduced in game and may not be fully canonical.

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* There have been discussions of Vostok and Zimkova but no major settled potentially canonical ideas.

*Needs Development:* The Zimkova and Vostok regions, although defined in both broad cultural strokes and their impact on the rest of the region, are nonetheless fairly light on detail. The relationship between nothern Vostok, southern Vostok, Tollen, and the Skaer is unclear. The religion of northern Vostok and its relationship to the kestavo traditions of the Zimka is unclear. 

*Intentionally Blank:*  The [[Grastenvakt|Gråstenvakt]] is intentionally undeveloped as to its history and purpose (the existence of the wall is canonical). Northern Zimkova is expected to be a setting for a multi-session arc of the Cleenseau campaign and space for mystery and adventure should be preserved in the region. 

*Adventures:* The [[Cleenseau Campaign]] and the Addermarch campaign are entirely set within this region, in southern Sembara and Addermarch respectively. The Dunmar Frontier campaign spent significant time in Tollen.
