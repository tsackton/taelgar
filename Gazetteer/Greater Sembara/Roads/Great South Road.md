# The Great South Road

An ancient road that runs from [[Embry]] to [[Cassons]]. In better days it ran south as far as [[Isingue]], and in the Drankorian era, was said to continue almost 2500 miles to [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] itself.

%%my assumption was always that the great south road itself is still quite intact at least all the way to Insingue, possibly even further, only really being disrupted by the upheavals that created the Garamjala Plateau and Yuvanti Mountains after the fall of Cha'mutte. I think of it more as a perfectly paved, well-repaired road leading off into the wastes%%

Although in poor repair in a few places, for much of its length it is paved with wide, smooth stones with drainage ditches on both sides. According to legend many of the stones in the road are a thousand years old, and have never cracked.
