The Tyrwinghan Road is a major route linking [[Wisford]]—at the junction of the [[Great South Road]] and the [[Wistel]]—to the [[Enst]] crossing at [[Eskbridge]], and onward into [[Tyrwingha]] toward towns such as [[Caerenad]] and [[Tafolwern]].

## DM notes

- The [[Rhewin]] notes that the [[Enad]] joins it just north of the Tyrwinghan Road, near [[Caerenad]].
- A note in [[The Brunebeck]] speculates that the river “follows the line of the Tyrwinghan Road” from near Eskbridge toward Wisford; treat this as a hypothesis pending a dedicated road description/map.
