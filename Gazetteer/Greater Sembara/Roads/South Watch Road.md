A new road, built during the reign of [[Cece I]] to connect [[Dunfry]] and the [[Army of the South|South Watch]] with [[Fellburn]] after the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|hobgoblin wars]]. Most of the road runs through unsettled land, although several fortified garrison-houses dot the road to support soldiers and messengers travelling the road.
