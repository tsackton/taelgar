%% maerwyn ridge works well too. might also give a litte more complexity there, and consider maerwyn as basically "White Peaks" literally in Tyrwinghan, and then have the Sembaran gloss Maerwyn Mountains, and then common = White Mountains. though that may be overkill here. this is some of the highest peaks in the mostreve and probably deserves a "mountains" ish name. common usage is probably just Maerwyns anyway. %%
