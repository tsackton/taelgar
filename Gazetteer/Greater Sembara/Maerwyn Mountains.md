# The Maerwyn Mountains

The Maerwyn Mountains are a line of high peaks in the [[Mostreve Hills]], running northeast along the border between [[Addermarch]] and [[Tyrwingha]]. They rise from the rough country near the [[Valenfray Hills]] and trend north toward the [[Enst]] river valley, highest in the south near the headwaters of the [[Branth]].

In Tyrwinghan military tradition, the Maerwyns are watched by border garrisons such as the [[Garn Tyrn Garrison]] and the [[Maerwyn Garrison]] of the [[Army of Mostreve]].

## DM notes

%% Original naming notes (preserved): %%
%% maerwyn ridge works well too. might also give a litte more complexity there, and consider maerwyn as basically "White Peaks" literally in Tyrwinghan, and then have the Sembaran gloss Maerwyn Mountains, and then common = White Mountains. though that may be overkill here. this is some of the highest peaks in the mostreve and probably deserves a "mountains" ish name. common usage is probably just Maerwyns anyway. %%
