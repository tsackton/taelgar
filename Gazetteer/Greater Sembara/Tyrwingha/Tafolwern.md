The capital city of Tyrwingha.

%% 
Very little has been invented or come up, even in my game with lots of Tyrwinghan backstory
Some notes from various emails/Discord conversations with Kiya re [[Celyn]] that need to be incorporated:
* Large, 35K people or so; 
* Fey vibe - not sure what? gardens? big towers? sparkling lights? but it should have something notably fey
* Has decorations in Sylvan but also fake Sylvan sometimes, as art (scene from Celyn background:)
  As they crossed a park, he stopped short and stopped laughing.  
        “What is it?” asked the halfling gruffly.  
        “That’s not real writing,” he said, pointing to a carving with mosaic inlay on a wall.  “It’s funny.”  
        “Not real writing?”  
        He looked around and found a stick and a bare patch of earth.  “Sylvan writing is like this.”  He sketched out a character, and embellished with others, just three, a simple thought, with tracing arcs indicating it should be read sunwise.  “Only I can’t write it properly, I don’t have the magic for it.  You see how the wall looks similar?  It’s like someone saw writing and didn’t know it was writing and just thought it would be pretty.”  He tossed the stick aside and scuffed out the marks he’d made with a toe.  “But since they don’t know how to write things it’s just kind of like writing.”  
   (based on: Sudden realization that the decorations in Tafolwern that are based on Sylvan texts probably look basically like AI-generated text to people literate in it)

Tafolwern culturally dominates the urban scene - like Paris in France, it is "the" city. I haven't really made up Tafolwern but there are definitely echoes of Ethlenn's court and plenty of fairy influence on the urban design
