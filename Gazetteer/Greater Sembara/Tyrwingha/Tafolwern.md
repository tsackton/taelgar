The capital city of Tyrwingha.

Very little has been invented or come up, even in my game with lots of Tyrwinghan backstory
Some notes from various emails/Discord conversations with Kiya re [[Celyn]] that need to be incorporated:
* Large, 35K people or so; 
* Fey vibe - not sure what? gardens? big towers? sparkling lights? but it should have something notably fey
* Has decorations in Sylvan but also fake Sylvan sometimes, as art (scene from Celyn background:)
  As they crossed a park, he stopped short and stopped laughing.  
        “What is it?” asked the halfling gruffly.  
        “That’s not real writing,” he said, pointing to a carving with mosaic inlay on a wall.  “It’s funny.”  
        “Not real writing?”  
        He looked around and found a stick and a bare patch of earth.  “Sylvan writing is like this.”  He sketched out a character, and embellished with others, just three, a simple thought, with tracing arcs indicating it should be read sunwise.  “Only I can’t write it properly, I don’t have the magic for it.  You see how the wall looks similar?  It’s like someone saw writing and didn’t know it was writing and just thought it would be pretty.”  He tossed the stick aside and scuffed out the marks he’d made with a toe.  “But since they don’t know how to write things it’s just kind of like writing.”  
   (based on: Sudden realization that the decorations in Tafolwern that are based on Sylvan texts probably look basically like AI-generated text to people literate in it)

Tafolwern culturally dominates the urban scene - like Paris in France, it is "the" city. I haven't really made up Tafolwern but there are definitely echoes of Ethlenn's court and plenty of fairy influence on the urban design
%%

Tafolwern is the pre‑eminent city of [[Tyrwingha]] and its capital, a place of broad parks, river walks, and towers whose ornament borrows the flowing lines of Sylvan script. The city’s culture radiates outward across the region: fashions, songs, and phrases begun here soon colour the speech of far towns.

## Character and Layout
Tafolwern sits astride a great bend in the river, stitched together by stone bridges and terraced gardens. Boulevards and courtyards are planned with an eye for vistas and performance spaces. Decorative friezes echo the look of Sylvan writing—often stylized by artists who do not themselves write the language, producing an intentional aesthetic rather than legible text.

## People and Culture
Theatres and salons flourish; itinerant companies make their reputations in Tafolwern before touring the provinces. Music and poetry mingle courtly tradition with woodland motifs long associated with the Wyrdling and Ethlenn’s court.

## Governance and Faith
As capital, Tafolwern houses the principal courts and ministerial offices of Tyrwingha. Temples and groves are distributed through the wards rather than concentrated in a single precinct, reflecting a balance between urban life and old pacts with the green places.

DM notes and campaign references
- See character backgrounds and travel notes touching Tafolwern (e.g., Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Celyn’s stories) for tone: intimidating size, Sylvan‑inspired decoration, and a sense of cultural centrality.
- Population ballpark used in notes: c. 35,000. Treat as campaign‑scale guidance rather than fixed census.
