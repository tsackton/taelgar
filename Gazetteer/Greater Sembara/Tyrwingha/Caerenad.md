Caerenad is a small Tyrwinghan town on the road between [[Eskbridge]] and [[Tafolwern]], roughly a three-day's journey south of Eskbridge. A wooded stream runs below a low hill crowned by the earl’s manor; in clear nights the pool below the slope mirrors the moon.

DM notes and campaign references
- Features in correspondence connected to the “Oracle of Hope” (see Campaigns/Cleenseau Campaign/Raw Emails: references to performances and the earl’s manor above Caerenad).
 
Inconsistencies and suggested resolutions (Tyrwinghan earls)
- Observation: This note mentions “the earl’s manor” above Caerenad, a small town. In Tyrwingha, earls are high lords with wide circuits (≈50 earls realm‑wide), and governance is village‑centric rather than Sembaran‑style manorial. See: Gazetteer/Greater Sembara/Tyrwingha/Political Organization of Tyrwingha.md (earls travel for months; villages host them); Gazetteer/Greater Sembara/Tyrwingha/Nefyn.md (town “hosts the Earl on their circuit”).
- Potential conflicts: (a) The phrase “earl’s manor” reads like a fixed Sembaran manorial seat; (b) Tyrwinghan practice emphasizes traveling courts and village hospitality rather than fixed taxation/manor structures.
- Suggested resolutions (choose any that fit tone):
  1) Interpret “earl’s manor” as an Earl’s Hall/Lodge maintained for the earl’s circuit stays (guest residence, ceremonial hall, storehouses), not a feudal manorial seat. Prefer “Earl’s Hall” or “Earl’s Lodge” in prose to avoid Sembaran manorial implications.
  2) Treat the Caerenad hall as a seasonal residence on the earl’s route between [[Eskbridge]] and [[Tafolwern]], with local provisioning organized by the village’s Court of All (per Political Organization note).
  3) If a permanent seat is desired here for story reasons, define it as a minor “house of administration” for a steward of the earl, with the earl’s principal household elsewhere; the earl visits but does not hold local taxes in Sembaran fashion.
- Net: keep the in‑world prestige (earl presence) while aligning terminology and usage to Tyrwinghan norms (traveling court; guest halls; village provisioning).
