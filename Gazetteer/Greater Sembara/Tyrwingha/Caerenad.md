Caerenad is a small Tyrwinghan town on the road between [[Eskbridge]] and [[Tafolwern]], roughly a three-day's journey south of Eskbridge, and near where the road crosses the [[Enad]], a brook that eventually joins the [[Maerwyn]] just north of the [[Tyrwinghan Road]]. 

The earl of the Enad Circuit has traditionally kept a fortified seasonal residence here, and it is traditional to spend the quiet period between [[Viatela]] and [[Quintarum]] here. 

The Enad is runs below a low hill crowned by the earl’s residence; in clear nights the pool below the slope mirrors the moon.
