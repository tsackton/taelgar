%% a small town on the road from Eskbridge to Tafolwern about a 3 day journey south from Eskbridge 
used in clee as color 
%%

Caerenad is a small Tyrwinghan town on the road between [[Eskbridge]] and [[Tafolwern]], a convenient stop where couriers and troupes trade a night’s rest for a day’s march. A wooded stream runs below a low hill crowned by the earl’s manor; in clear nights the pool below the slope mirrors the moon.

Wayhouses, a modest market green, and a chapel serve locals and travelers alike. The town’s fortunes rise and fall with the traffic bound for the capital.
