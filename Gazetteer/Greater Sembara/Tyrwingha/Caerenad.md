Caerenad is a small Tyrwinghan town on the road between [[Eskbridge]] and [[Tafolwern]], roughly a three-day's journey south of Eskbridge, and near where the road crosses the [[Enad]], a brook that eventually joins the [[Rhewin]] just north of the [[Tyrwinghan Road]]. 

The earl of the Enad Circuit keeps a fortified seasonal residence here, where they traditionally spend the period between [[Viatela]] and [[Quintarum]]. 

The [[Enad]] runs below a low hill crowned by the earl’s residence; in clear nights the pool below the slope mirrors the moon.
