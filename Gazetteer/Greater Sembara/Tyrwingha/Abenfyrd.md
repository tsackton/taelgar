Abenfyrd is a small wooded village along the banks of the [[Aben|Aben River]] known for its timber, and relatively prosperous because of it.

Not much happens in Abenfyrd save the yearly [[Festival of the Miracle of the Mist]], a commemoration of a time when [[the Wanderer]] (it is said) used dense mists to lead a pack of trolls from the [[Plaguelands]] into the Aben, to drown. 

This festival does attract some people from other nearby villages, and the fair held for several days on either side is a major event in Abenfyrd.

There is a large temple to the Wanderer here, which occasionally receives pilgrams, miracle workers, and others seeking the Wanderer's blessing.
