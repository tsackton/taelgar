A small market town about two hour's walk from [[Clawyn]], a quiet place just before the land starts to rise towards the [[Mostreve Hills]]. Much wheat is grown here, and it is a little bigger than the surrounding villages, and often hosts the Earl on their circuit, and has two blacksmith's, an inn, and an apothecary, as well as a relatively well attended market on the second and fourth Saturday's of every month.
