# High Horn
High Horn is a high, wind‑scoured pass across the Sembaran highlands, linking the Zimkova frontier with approaches toward the Highland Kingdoms. It is one of the limited traversable saddles in the central spine between the Western Marches and the northern uplands, and has long served drovers, couriers, and small caravans seeking a straighter line than the coastal roads.

The route is steep and narrow in places, with stacked stone cairns and weathered way‑posts marking the safest line over exposed ridges. Snow and rime can close the pass for weeks in deep winter, and storms that spill down from the Sentinel Range often make travel treacherous even in shoulder seasons.

## History and Use
High Horn has been known since early Drankorian times as a seasonal alternative to the lower western roads. Local lords traditionally levy tolls at the approaches when they can hold them, though in unsettled years such dues lapse. Waystations on either side wax and wane with the security of the countryside.

## Hazards
Rock fall, sudden whiteouts, and banditry are the chief hazards. In years of border tension, patrols from either side may restrict movement. Travellers typically cross in small, well‑provisioned groups and avoid the height of winter.
