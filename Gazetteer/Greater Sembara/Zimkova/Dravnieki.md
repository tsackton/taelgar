%% DRAHV-nyeh-kee 

After an unexpected fall of hunting orcs, Justas and Finnan, you are wintering in the small village of Dravnieki (DRAHV-nyeh-kee) on the banks of the upper Teft. The village was attacked twice by orcs, and you are here in part as a favor to the village elders, as added protection in case more dangers come out of the winter. Other than the rumors around the Chasm, it has been a quiet winter, although you wonder about the omens, and think maybe a journey to the Chasm would be interesting, come spring.

Didn't really come up in game
