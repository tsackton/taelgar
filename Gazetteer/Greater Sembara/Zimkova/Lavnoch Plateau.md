%% @Mike: minor edits for clarity and tone and some clarifying questions; imo there is a disconnect between the vibes and the stated elevations, which are much too low for a barren windswept vibe %%

The Lavnoch Plateau is a cold, high plateau marked by long, snowy winters and short, cool summers, rising from the [[Braebein]] in the east.
### Geography and Climate
The Lavnoch Plateau is a broad, wind-scoured region of rolling uplands, windswept ridges, and isolated basalt outcrops. Much of its surface lies between 3,000’ and 3,500’, though the northern and western edges rise steadily toward a series of cold, treeless highlands above 5,000’, where even summer frosts are common. 

The land is carved by shallow valleys and high meadows; in spring, these troughs fill with snowmelt, forming strings of cold, clear lakes and peat-heavy wetlands. Forest cover is sparse—limited to pockets of hardy spruce and larch in sheltered basins—while the exposed plateaus host tough grasses, heather, dwarf pine, and lichens.

this does not make sense to me. this is 700 miles from the western gulf / 1100 miles from the Green Sea, so very inland. the treeline should be more like 10,000 feet; 3000 - 3500 feet is LOW, not high, for the Sentinels foothills, and even at 5000 feet you'd expect significant trees. Think Yellowstone, not Whites. 

If the vibe is "cold exposed plateau", I think the elevation needs to be much higher, at least 8,000 feet and probably more like 10,000 - 11,000 feet. Think Tibet. 

But I think a forested high mountain plateau akin to Yellowstone / northern Rockies is also totally reasonable here and fits with the vibe of Aurbez as Colorado front range.

Winters in Lavnoch are long, bitter, and dry, with temperatures often plunging far below freezing as cold air sweeps down from the Sentinel Range; snow arrives early and lingers into late spring. Summers are brief and cool, punctuated by sudden thunderstorms as warm monsoon air pushes westward from the lowlands. Rain falls most heavily in late summer, though much of it drains quickly through the rocky soils. 

%% this implies elevations of more like 8000 - 10000 feet to me; at 3000 - 5000 feet probably still pleasant into October or later, though spring may come late if there is significant winter snowfall (but as winters are dry this isn't like a Sierra Nevadas thing with 50 feet of snow) %%

### Population and People
Lavnoch is only sparsely populated, home to scattered Zimka clans and small fortified villages. Most inhabitants live in low, stone-built hamlets near dependable springs or along the plateau’s swift-running streams. These communities are typically small—rarely more than a few dozen families—and rely heavily on pastoralism. Sheep, goats, and shaggy upland cattle form the backbone of the local economy, moving during the brief summer up onto the high pastures and retreating to warm byres during the long winter months.


%% not sure this level of detail is needed 
#### Demographics
The Lavnoch Plateau supports an estimated 20,000 to 35,000 inhabitants across its broad expanse. Settlement is uneven: nearly three-quarters of Lavnoch’s population lives in the **southern and western** borders of the plateau, where the land drops slightly, the winters are marginally gentler. Much of the remainder lives in the gentle valleys carved by the three largest rivers that flow from the northern uplands to the Semb, the: the Dornach, the Kelmor, and the Dreuswell. %% Not sure about this names, placeholders for now, except I like the Dornach %%

The **northern uplands**—those above 4,500’—hold only a handful of permanent hamlets, mostly herding communities clustered around rare sheltered bowls or reliable springs.

### Borders
The plateau is bordered in the west by the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]] which rise from western Lavnoch to great peaks over 10,000' tall.  In the east, it is bordered by the [[Braebein]] - a series of mountainous hills with a few peaks over 6,000' - and the [[Lauswald]], an eerie forest said to be haunted by the children of [[Zeyfa]]. In the north, the terrain rises to over 5,000' before descending in a series of more gentle foothills to the land around the [[Great Chasm]]. In the south, a series of sharp, rocky hills separate the edge of the plateau from the [[Semb]] river valley.

%% a brief note on topography:
![[Pasted image 20251202104025.png]]I think the heights run from darkest to lightest in this map. 
(1) Basically part of the sentinels -mountains some reaching over 12,000 feet. This is like the Yellowstone Rockies or something. 
(2) Uplands; above treeline (>8000 feet) but wooded in valleys
(3) High Plateau; probably around 6000 feet, mostly wooded except on north faces ridges and on higher peaks
(4) Low Plateau; probably 4000-6000 feet, forested
(5) "Hidden Valley" probably ~5000 feet, forested but left TBD - not really part of Lavnoch culturally

%%
Some trade with dwarves is important; this is a high plateau but in general is part of the wider "Zimkova".

This has been intentionally significant refactored from earlier ideas that suggested a distinct "kingdom" in the highlands. The terrain and lifestyle of the plateau suggests a less organized/feudal kind of place and it seems more interesting to consider Ardlas and Lavnoch as very different, rather than squabbling brothers. There may be space for Ardlas itself to have several different political organizations within it, but see [[Ardlas]] for more.
