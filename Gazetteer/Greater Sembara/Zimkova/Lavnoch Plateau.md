%% Tim: rewrite %%

The Lavnoch Plateau rises from the [[Braebein]] in the east and is a cold high plateau marked with long, snowy winters and short, cool summers. 
### Geography and Climate
The Lavnoch Plateau is a broad, wind-scoured tableland of rolling uplands, frost-polished ridges, and isolated basalt outcrops. Much of its surface lies between **3,000’ and 3,500’**, though the northern third rises steadily toward a series of cold, treeless highlands above **5,000’**, where even summer frosts are common. The land is carved by shallow valleys and high meadows; in spring, these troughs fill with snowmelt, forming strings of cold, clear lakes and peat-heavy wetlands. Forest cover is sparse—limited to pockets of hardy spruce and larch in sheltered basins—while the exposed plateaus host tough grasses, heather, dwarf pine, and lichens.

Winters in Lavnoch are **long, bitter, and dry**, with temperatures often plunging far below freezing as cold air sweeps down from the Sentinel Range. Snow arrives early and lingers into late spring, and the sun rides low for months, leaving the land under pale light and sharp, crystalline winds. Summers, when they finally come, are **brief, cool, and bright**, punctuated by sudden thunderstorms as warm monsoon air pushes westward from the lowlands. Rain falls most heavily in late summer, though much of it drains quickly through the rocky soils, leaving the plateau’s rivers swift, cold, and clear. The thin air, steady winds, and extreme temperature swings give Lavnoch its stark beauty—a place where horizons stretch far and human footprints remain rare.
### Population and People
Lavnoch is only **sparsely populated**, home to scattered Zimka clans and small fortified villages. Most inhabitants live in low, stone-built hamlets near dependable springs or along the plateau’s swift-running streams. These communities are typically small—rarely more than a few dozen families—and rely heavily on pastoralism. **Sheep, goats, and shaggy upland cattle** form the backbone of the local economy, moving during the brief summer up onto the high pastures and retreating to warm byres during the long winter months.
#### Demographics
The Lavnoch Plateau supports an estimated **20,000 to 35,000 inhabitants** across its broad expanse. Settlement is uneven: nearly three-quarters of Lavnoch’s population lives in the **southern and western** borders of the plateau, where the land drops slightly, the winters are marginally gentler. Much of the remainder lives in the gentle valleys carved by the three largest rivers that flow from the northern uplands to the Semb, the: the Dornach, the Kelmor, and the Dreuswell. %% Not sure about this names, placeholders for now, except I like the Dornach %%

The **northern uplands**—those above 4,500’—hold only a handful of permanent hamlets, mostly herding communities clustered around rare sheltered bowls or reliable springs.

### Borders
The plateau is bordered in the west by the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]] which rise from western Lavnoch to great peaks over 10,000' tall.  In the west, it is bordered by the [[Braebein]] - a series of mountainous hills with a few peaks over 6,000' - and the [[Lauswald]], an eerie forest said to be haunted by the children of [[Zeyfa]]. In the north, the terrain rises to over 5,000' before descending in a series of more gentle foothills to the land around the [[Great Chasm]]. In the south, a series of sharp, rocky hills separate the edge of the plateau from the [[Semb]] river valley.

Some trade with dwarves is important; this is a high plateau but in general is part of the wider "Zimkova".

This has been intentionally significant refactored from earlier ideas that suggested a distinct "kingdom" in the highlands. The terrain and lifestyle of the plateau suggests a less organized/feudal kind of place and it seems more interesting to consider Ardlas and Lavnoch as very different, rather than squabbling brothers. There may be space for Ardlas itself to have several different political organizations within it, but see [[Ardlas]] for more.
