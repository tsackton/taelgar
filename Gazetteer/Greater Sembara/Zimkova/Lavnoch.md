Needs lots of invention, various notes in sembaran history, etc but ulimately mostly a blank slate

- Basic political organization is the village, with a Speaker    
- Most developed as political units of the highland kingdoms with strong kings and organized central government    
- Strong alliance with dwarves over the last 50-100 years and many dwarves might live in some of the mountain towns. Some highlanders also live in dwarven towns in this area.    
- The two kingdoms are sometimes rivals, sometimes allies, but have a clear sense of shared culture.     
- Trade in raw materials important, as is small scale farming and especially sheep/goats    
- Growing less ‘Sembaran’ esp with the dwarven influence

See also [[Ardlas]] and background in the various Sembaran worldbuilding docs. But nothing is canonical really or has come up in game
