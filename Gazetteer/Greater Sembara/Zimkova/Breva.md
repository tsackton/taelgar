A highlander kingdom.

%% Notes 
 -    A small kingdom, and in some ways riven by the most internal tensions.     
-   On the borders of the northern highlands the western highlands (Lavnoch), and the northlands of Sembara.    
-   Probably has the least cohesion of any of the highland kingdoms, and a weak king -- perhaps mostly a figurehead. Some of the nobles might be more aligned with the north, or the west, or the east and this could be a good place for political intrigue and so on.    
-   Perhaps little true cultural cohesion and a lot of challenges being organized. The northern landowners who live in the rising slopes of the north plateau are really more aligned with unorganized northern traditionalists; the ones in the west with Lavnoch, and the southern parts with the northlands    
-   Might work to have it a little bit smaller than it is on the map, moving up the northlands

Very unclear on the details here. Some notes in the various Sembara timelines. One point is that the whole Anne-Elaine thing might have ended with Anne still being queen of Breva. Should probably be aligned closely with the more northern duchies? i.e. Telham Or at least have a cultural vibe that is more Tollen/Telham/something and a bit distinct from the other "highlander" kingdoms.

But nothing made up is canonical or has come up in game so there is a lot of room to change this.
