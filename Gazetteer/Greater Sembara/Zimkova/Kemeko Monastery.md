Kemeko Monastery is a secluded stronghold on the north side of the [[Great Chasm]], reached by descending the giant‑carved stairways far below the river channel. Though often called a monastery by outsiders, it is better known in local tales as a refuge and training ground for the kenku who keep watch over the Chasm’s winds.

blood feathers, rituals, in the Chasm because no one bothers them there, not because it is sacred
