Kemeko Monastery is a secluded stronghold on the north side of the [[Great Chasm]], reached by descending the giant‑carved stairways far below the river channel. Though often called a monastery by outsiders, those who visit find it is better described as a hidden training ground for a secluded group of kenku who practice military arts in the winds and updrafts of the [[Great Chasm]].

Vibe notes: military barracks, not really a monastery in the traditional sense, dedicated to keeping alive Aerin's fighting arts from the Great War 

Blood feathers, rituals, in the Chasm because no one bothers them there, not because it is sacred
