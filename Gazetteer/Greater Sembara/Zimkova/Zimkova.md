# Zimkova

North of [[Sembara]] the land rises towards the [[Sentinel Range]], and is the ancient homeland of the Zimka, who once inhabited the [[Enst]], [[Teft]], [[Semb]], and [[Wistel]] river valleys, as well as the foothills of the Sentinels. Today, the lands of the Zimka people can be loosely organized into three realms ([[Ardlas]], [[Lavnoch]], and [[Breva]]) and the northern lands (often called just Zimkova, or north Zimkova), less organized and without any traditional political boundaries.  

The ancient history of this land is poorly known, but in the small fortified villages along the upper [[Teft]] or [[Volta]] tales are still told of a long migration across the mountains, and of how the people found the [[Kestavo|kestavo]] amongst the woods and foothills around the [[Volta]]. Some in the wooded foothills where the [[Volta]] arises tell of a sundering where many of the [[Zimka]] went south and east after the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], and others stayed in the north. 

#### Geography
The region of Zimkova consists entirely of highlands, between the tall peaks of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and the Sembara lowlands. In general, a line of hills runs from the [[Aine Hills]] just north of the [[Wistel]], through the [[Braebein]], between the [[Semb]] and the [[Volta]] to the [[~Volta Hills~]]. Zimkova is the land west and north of this line of hills.

Three watersheds and two mountain spurs divide Zimkova:

* In the south, the [[Bollin]] is easily crossed, and the land is more fertile and lower than elsewhere in Zimkova
* The [[Semb]] and [[Lake Derwent]] mark a turning of the land, and it grows steeper and hillier north of the [[Semb]]
* The [[Volta]], in the north, has many lakes and tributaries, as it drains the lands between the [[~Central Sentinel Spur~]], the [[~North Sentinel Spur~]], and the [[~North Vostok Mountains~]] 

* The ~Southern Sentinel Spur~, extending east north of the [[Semb]] watershed, is treacherous terrain, and forms a boundary between southern and northern Zimkova. Many of the small rivers that form the Semb flow south from here
* The ~Central Sentinel Spur~ stretches east to the Teft, and is the source of the [[Kasari]], one of the tributaries of the [[Volta]]. It divides the forests of [[Breva]] from the north
* The [[~North Sentinel Spur~]] forms the northern boundary of Zimkova, its high peaks unpassable much of the year, save by the foolhardy or brave

### The Great Chasm
Between the [[~Central Sentinel Spur~]] and the [[~Southern Sentinel Spur~]] lies the [[Great Chasm]] a mysterious gouge in the earth surrounded by rumors and myth. The Zimka believe it is the home of [[Zeyfa]], the cruel west wind, and do not settle near it.

### The Breva Forest
A dense forest stretches from the [[Volta]] to [[Semb]]. Between the [[Teft]] and the [[Volta]] this forest is populated and forms most of the realm of [[Breva]]. South and west of the [[Teft]] it is dangerous and trackless wilderness until it peters out near the [[Semb]].

### People and Culture
The geography above forms three cultural regions:

* South Zimkova, the lands south of the [[~Southern Sentinel Spur~]], the [[Breva Forest]], and west of the [[Braebein]]. This land has seen much intermixing with Sembara, and the realms of [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch]] have been under the overlordship of Sembara at various times in their history. This land has lost many of the ancient traditions of the [[Zimka]], and although it has retained a unique culture and language, [[Mos Numena]] is the most common religion here and the worship of [[Kestavo]] has largely faded
* Breva, nestled between the [[Teft]] and the [[Volta]], and separated from the north by the [[~Central Sentinel Spur~]], a unique blended culture, where kestavo still dominate and a fierce independent streak keeps the people independent
* North Zimkova, lightly peopled and scattered, where the ancient ways still hold sway, a land of hunters and small fortified villages, mostly clinging to the [[Volta]] and its tributaries. 

%% Notes: 
Basic logic is that there are three "cultural" regions:

- the north, almost pure kestavo, little sembara influence, centered around Volta headwaters (=2),
- Breva, with a bit of a unique culture, definite sembaran influence but still primarily kestavo, has a ruler who maintains the riverguard and the forestguard or something like that (=1), plus with some odd stuff on the western border, where access to the Chasm is easiest,
- the south (=4 and 5) Ardlas and Lavoch. Actually fairly isolated from the north, by the mountain spur circled in green and the dense unpopulated woods between Lavnoch and Breva. Mos Numena is mostly worshipped here, although with a few kestavo here and there. Much much more Sembaran than Breva or the north, and with potentially interesting or complicated politics. Definitely allied with dwarves

in map below 
1 = Breva "the land between two rivers" bordered by Volta and Teft, heavily forested, fairly traditional part of Zimka. Lots of little forified villages, a monarch of sorts who mostly organizes the "forest guard" 
2 = north Zimkova = totally unorganized, lightly populated, no monarches, taxes, etc - but lots of little traditional villages along the volta in particular. heartland of kestavo 
3 = Great Chasm = not really any people here, seen as taboo by Breva and north Zimkova for sure 
4 = Lavnoch. bordered on the north by a spur of high peaks - crossable but not in winter, isolating the green circle and on the south by the Semb (although the southern border with Ardlas might be contested, or not really a border, or something) 
5 = Ardlas = richest of the zimkova region. May not have a clear border with Lavnoch, might be more of a continuum
6 = south spur
7 = central spur
8 and rest of moutains are north spur

%% OLD Brainstorming Notes:

Everyhing I've made up is here or discord; there are some notes in various other obisidan docs and a long thread in discord during the language background discussions that created Tollish

Ancient history: The broad swath of land from the [[Sentinel Range]] to the [[~North Vostok Mountains~]] is settled by 

Note: this replaces Zovcka. Need to update the maps to remove Zovcka

-   Isolationist and wants to be left alone  
-   In some of the higher steppes, still speak the old east northlander and a major reserve of worshippers of the old gods
-   A strong cultural tradition of staying out of larger politics and wanting to be left alone. 
-   Low population density
-   Hunting still important in some regions, although hardy grains (i.e. barley or an analog) and wooly mountain goats/sheep are the main food source.
- Strong connection to stoneborn and kestavo
