North of [[Sembara]] the land rises towards the [[Sentinel Range]], and is the ancient homeland of the Zimka, who once inhabited the [[Enst]], [[Teft]], [[Semb]], and [[Wistel]] river valleys, as well as the foothills of the Sentinels. Today, the lands of the Zimka people can be loosely organized into three realms ([[Ardlas]], [[Lavnoch]], and [[Breva]]) and the northern lands (often called just Zimkova, or north Zimkova), less organized and without any traditional political boundaries.  

Ardlas, Lavnoch, and Breva were, at times part of the Sembaran realm, but today are independent and fiercely proud of it. Closely allied with the dwarves of the mountains, these kingdoms are lands of sheepfarmers and smallholders, and mostly stay to themselves.

-   Low population density
-   Hunting still important in some regions, although hardy grains (i.e. barley or an analog) and wooly mountain goats/sheep are the main food source.
- Strong connection to stoneborn and kestavo
