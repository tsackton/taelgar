%% @Mike needs updating to reflect Lavnoch plateau and more recent discussion around Breva / upper Volta %%

North of [[Sembara]] the land rises towards the [[Sentinel Range]] along the [[Teft]] and [[Volta]] rivers. This is the homeland of the [[Zimka]]. The ancient history of this land is poorly known, but in the small fortified villages along the upper [[Teft]] or [[Volta]] tales are still told of a long migration across the mountains, and of how the people found the [[Kestavo|kestavo]] amongst the bogs and lakes of the upper [[Volta]]. Some tell of a sundering where many of the [[Zimka]] went south and east after the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], and others stayed in the north, but whether this is true or legend is not known.
## Geography and Climate

Zimkova is a broad region of highland plateaus, dense forest, and boreal wetlands stretching across the northern part of [[Greater Sembara]]. Broadly, there are four main regions:

* The upper [[Volta]], a great depression that sits between 800' and 1200', full of scattered pine forests, peat bogs, and kettle lakes, where the Volta River arises from many small rivers
* The Breva Forest, a hilly and forested highland, sitting between 1800' and 3000' feet, a mix of dense pine forests and 

The region of Zimkova consists entirely of highlands, between the tall peaks of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and the Sembara lowlands. In general, a line of hills runs from the [[Aine Hills]] just north of the [[Wistel]], through the [[Braebein]], between the [[Semb]] and the [[Volta]] to the [[~Volta Hills~]]. Zimkova is the land west and north of this line of hills.

Three watersheds and two mountain spurs divide Zimkova:

* In the south, the [[Bollin]] is easily crossed, and the land is more fertile and lower than elsewhere in Zimkova
* The [[Semb]] and [[Lake Derwent]] mark a turning of the land, and it grows steeper and hillier north of the [[Semb]]
* The [[Volta]], in the north, has many lakes and tributaries, as it drains the lands between the [[~Central Sentinel Spur~]], the [[~North Sentinel Spur~]], and the [[~North Vostok Mountains~]] 

* The ~Southern Sentinel Spur~, extending east north of the [[Semb]] watershed, is treacherous terrain, and forms a boundary between southern and northern Zimkova. Many of the small rivers that form the Semb flow south from here
* The ~Central Sentinel Spur~ stretches east to the Teft, and is the source of the [[Kasari]], one of the tributaries of the [[Volta]]. It divides the forests of [[Breva]] from the north
* The [[~North Sentinel Spur~]] forms the northern boundary of Zimkova, its high peaks unpassable much of the year, save by the foolhardy or brave

### The Great Chasm
Between the [[~Central Sentinel Spur~]] and the [[~Southern Sentinel Spur~]] lies the [[Great Chasm]] a mysterious gouge in the earth surrounded by rumors and myth. The Zimka believe it is the home of [[Zeyfa]], the cruel west wind, and do not settle near it.

### The Breva Forest
A dense forest stretches from the [[Volta]] to [[Semb]]. Between the [[Teft]] and the [[Volta]] this forest is populated and forms most of the realm of [[Breva]]. South and west of the [[Teft]] it is dangerous and trackless wilderness until it peters out near the [[Semb]].

### People and Culture
The geography above forms three cultural regions:

* South Zimkova, the lands south of the [[~Southern Sentinel Spur~]], the [[Breva Forest]], and west of the [[Braebein]]. This land has seen much intermixing with Sembara, and the realms of [[Ardlas]] and [[Lavnoch Plateau]] have been under the overlordship of Sembara at various times in their history. This land has lost many of the ancient traditions of the [[Zimka]], and although it has retained a unique culture and language, [[Mos Numena]] is the most common religion here and the worship of [[Kestavo]] has largely faded
* Breva, nestled between the [[Teft]] and the [[Volta]], and separated from the north by the [[~Central Sentinel Spur~]], a unique blended culture, where kestavo still dominate and a fierce independent streak keeps the people independent
* North Zimkova, lightly peopled and scattered, where the ancient ways still hold sway, a land of hunters and small fortified villages, mostly clinging to the [[Volta]] and its tributaries. 

%% Notes: 

Btrainstorming notes for Zimkova:

The map below has basic "elevation" sections. Red is "high" (for various definitions of high). Green is "medium", and yellow is "low"

![[rough-map-zimkova-2.png]]

The basic idea is that Red 6 / Red 1 / Red 3 / Red 5 are all barriers to travel and lightly or not at all settled. 

Drankor expands to  Yellow 1 / Green 1 but no were else. Today, you basically have:

Yellow 1: The upper Semb. Intermixed Zimka/Sembara. Complex politics.
Green 1: The heart of the Ardlas "highlands"
Red 6:  High Ardlas, not much inhabited except maybe along the mountains and maybe a lot of dwarves

Red 1: Braebin. High hill, mining in the east. Maybe stoneborn? Not a lot of human settlement, if any. Could be dwarves, but my view is the vibe of Sembara is no big dwarven mountain settlements, and this is supposed to be why Arnsbury is why it is - near the silver mines

Red 2: [[Lavnoch Plateau]]

Green 3: [[Great Chasm]] might have been lots of people once, now kinda weird

Red 4: "high" Zimkova. Still populated in the vallerys. but this is where you might find a lot of old Zimkovan speakers

Yellow 2: bogs, boreal wetlands. "low" Zimkova

Green 2: the Breva Forest. Heartland of "modern" Zimkova; only purely Zimka organized kingdom. Probably the poliltical organization is only from Volta - Teft

Red 3: the "low Braebein" (might have a different name). Barrier to travel but not totally unpopulated, although there are probably some sharp ridges and  valleys that make travel difficult, keeping the Sembaran and Breva sides fairly culturally distinct.

Red 5: The Vostok high plateau. Unclear what is here.
