The Gulf of Chardon is the name for the sheltered body of water formed by the [[Apporia]] to the west and south, and the mainland to the east. 

Relatively sheltered from major storms, it is a well-traveled maritime highway, with numerous sailing ships, fishing boats, and naval vessels passing to and from [[Chardon]].  It is also rich in marine life and is a highly productive fishing area.
