Notes from GDrive
#### Emerald Coast

- Needs a name, maybe. Coast of the Emerald bay, southwest of Chardon.Â 
    
- Ancient, magical canal  ([[Old Chardon Canal]]) cuts through narrow part of the isthmus, allowing seagoing travel, but expensive to navigate for ~to be determined reasons~
    
- Large southern port/trading city, one of the 2-3 largest in Chardon Empire outside Chardon
    
- The northern slopes of the [[~Darba Coastal Mountains~]] are another significant mining area.

[[Yeraad]] river flows through here
