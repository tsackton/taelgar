There are two major islands:

- Rocky, warm subtropical islands, kind of Caribbean vibe
    
- Main islands and by far the biggest population centers of Illoria
    
- Highly seafaring people; largely a motley group of refugees, outcasts, and pirates
    
- Recently conquered by Chardon, and now a Protectorate of the Empire, with a Chardonian governor installed
    
- Aiming for a kind of freewheeling attitude of the people, some piracy but generally kind of outlaws + outcasts vibe; mostly small cities and seacoast towns, economy deeply tied to ocean
