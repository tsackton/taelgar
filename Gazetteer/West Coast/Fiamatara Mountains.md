%% originally invented name but haven't really used in the Great Library campaign and not sold on it; one of the biggest mountains is called Goldpeak and has an ancient dwarven mine under it; Goldpeak Mountains is a possible replacement %%

%% Great Library campaign notes:
- extensive pre-Great-War dwarven mines and structures underneath mountains, but abandoned during or shortly after Great War and now empty/claimed by monsters
- a few random hermits and others live on the mountains now but not otherwise densely inhabited
- tall enough for glaciers
%%

%% Tim: not sure if there are more outstanding notes than the block above; tagged internal but you can switch to external if other sources %%
