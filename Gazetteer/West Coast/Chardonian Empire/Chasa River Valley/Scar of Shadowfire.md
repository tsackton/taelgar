A dead region where nothing grows along the Chasa, the site of a battle during the wars in the west after the Great War.

Mile 255 from Chardon: Site of the [[Battle of Shadowfire]], a major Chardonian defeat.
## The Shadowfire Battle Site

A great scar on the southern side of the river, a gash in the land of bare earth and rock. Strange mists cling to the land here, and nothing grows. Few people dare travel through this area. The dead area is about 20-100 feet wide, and 1/2 a mile long.

This was once the front lines of the army, wiped out by the dragon advance. Many, many unburied dead lie here, their bodies turned to ash by dragonfire. The ruins of a major fortification also stand here, largely destroyed by the battle, but are considered haunted.

Investigating in these ruins will turn up unquiet dead (ghosts, specters, wraiths, maybe gallows speaker. See: [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/genres-of-horror#GhostStories](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/genres-of-horror#GhostStories) and [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures#MorbidMemory](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vrgtr/horror-adventures#MorbidMemory)

But a chance for treasure too - anything non-magical would have been melted by the dragonfire, but should be arrows of slaying around, as well as some +1 weapons.

This is a dangerous place - the shadow hunter's allies will have extra strength here.
