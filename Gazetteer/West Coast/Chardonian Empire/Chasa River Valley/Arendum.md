%% substantial notes in OneNote from Cape / Elderwood adventure %%

Arendum is a substantial provincial town, with a frontier vibe. Built on the ruins of a former city-state, [[Kin-Aska]], which was a Chardonian satellite, a mixed Northlander/Drankorian culture with good relations with the nearby Deno'qai tribes in the forests, as well as the elves.


%% From Cape adventure briefing emails:
* The road is reasonably busy, and goes all the way to Arendum, about 500 miles east at the edge of the Chardonian Empire, on the eaves of the Elderwood.
