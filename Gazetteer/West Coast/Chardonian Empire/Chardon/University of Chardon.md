# The University of Chardon

The University of Chardon is a famous center of learning and teaching, renowned as one of the great centers of magical knowledge in the world. It occupies much of [[Precinct IV]] in Chardon, and is among the oldest and most powerful institutions in the city. The university is closely affiliated with the [[Great Library]], as well as the [[Hetaeri Magica]] and the [[Society of the Open Scroll]], but has its own independent rules and governance. 

*In the middle of the oldest part of Chardon, the towers and spires of the Chardonian Lecti, the halls and colleges that make up the University of Chardon, rise above he bustle of the students, faculty, tutors, and others, sharing the skyline with the towers of famous wizards dancing with subtle magic.*
## Facilities and Organization

### Undergraduate Lecti

The University is organized primarily into a series of undergraduate colleges, known collective as the Chardonian Lecti, that employ masters to teach undergraduates. Each college, known as a lectum (plural: lecti), is functionally independent, maintaining their own hall, sometimes with student housing, and arranging their own source of funds to pay masters to teach. Funds come from diverse sources, including, but not limited to, student fees, the imperial state, rich benefactors, the temple, and endowments. The halls of the Chardonian Lecti are almost exclusively located in [[Precinct IV]], and tend to cluster around the prominent Great Library campus, with its massive spire, but there is no formal central organization that allots space, and competition among lecti for space, masters, and students is often contentious.

%% note
While the university controls the largest portion of land in the Academia Quarter (Precinct IV), it is somewhat disorganized as there is often considerable competition among the various halls and lecti for students and masters, and thus it generally welds less real political power than the Hetaeri Magica or the Great Library. The disorganization is probably subtly encouraged by the Imperial state to keep the University from becoming a major alternate power base.

Architecturally, most lecti mimic the Great Library, with towers rising above the main building or building complex, which gives the university district a distinctive and impressive skyline. 

Some of the more famous lecti include [[Sibyl's Hall]], one of the original colleges of the University, and [[Maruso Lectum]], endowed by and named after an extremely wealthy adventurer.

The lecti are named XXX Hall or XXX Lectum. The halls are associated with various external orders, whether gods or something else, while the lecti are patronage based, although this is not a perfect rule.

### Graduate Faculties

In addition to the undergraduate lecti, the University of Chardon has five graduate faculties: the [[Faculty of Magic]], the [[Faculty of Law]], the [[Faculty of Theology]] (which includes medicine and healing), the [[Faculty of History]], and the [[Faculty of Metaphysics]] (which includes supernatural and planar studies). These higher faculties are governed independently from the undergraduate lecti. with their own departmental facilities and policies.
### Governance

The University of Chardon operates under its original Drankorian Charter granted in DR 980, and thus claims to be above and outside the laws and politics of the current day city. Students who are accused of crimes are, according to the university, only able to be tried and punished by university courts (although the Imperial bureaucracy claims the ability to confine students to university grounds without trial, which is occasionally contentious).

The [[Hetaeri Magica]], which draws members from both the University of Chardon and the [[Great Library]] controls and propagates rules on the use of magic within [[Precinct IV]], the academic quarter of Chardon.
