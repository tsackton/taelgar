The oldest building and organization in Chardon, dedicated to collecting and preserving knowledge, often in the form of books and scholarly works, though the Great Library also funds adventuring expeditions to recover more esoteric treasure. 

## History
- (DR:: 688): *(Great Library)*: A small library is constructed in Chardon, known as the Sibyline Archives, associated with the [[Sibylinites]], a secret order in Drankor devoted to secret knowledge of [[The Sibyl]]. 
- (DR:: 1063): *(Great Library)*: The Sibyline Archives are expanded, nearly doubling in size, to accomodate books and knowledge saved from the fall of Drankor. Become known as The Great Library of Chardon
