## Sybil's Hall

Sybil's Hall is one of the original colleges of the University, founded in DR 981, and for a long time it was one of the most powerful and well-funded of the colleges. However, since the Great War many of the religious orders of protection and defense that flourished in the west have fallen in power, and patronage has declined, so many of these places now are heavily dependent on tuition and often are falling into disrepair.

Sibyl's Hall is no exception. Sitting in a prime location in the center of the University, and controlling a small quadrangle with a central yard, student rooms, a bar, lecture halls, a refectory, common rooms, and a temple of the Sibyl. However, most of these buildings are in poor repair, and the Hall is in a downward spiral, unable to attract the best tutors and thus unable to attract the best/richest students.
