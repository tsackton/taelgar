# Portalia

Portalia is one of the three Apporian Provinces, located on the northwest coast of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]]. It is the most Chardonian of the three provinces, as much of Portalia was destroyed during the [[War of the Dark Rift]], and not rebuilt until it was liberated by Chardon at the conclusion of the war. 

Portalia is centered around the [[Old Chardon Canal]], which is the primary economic asset of the province. The [[Gulf of Chardon]] coast is fairly marshy, with extensive salt marshes stretching in both directions from the mouth of the canal, which somewhat limits development, although the city of [[Nevium]], built on pilings over the marshes, is the largest city and provincial capital due to tax revenue from the canal. 

Other towns and cities in Portalia include [[Pergia]], on the southern coast; and [[Artevus]], a minor fishing village near the northern border of the province.
