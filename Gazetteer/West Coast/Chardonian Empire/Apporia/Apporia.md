Apporia, or the Apporian Peninsula, is a very large peninsula that stretches west from the area between the [[Yeraad River Basin]] and the [[Chasa River Valley]], and surrounded by the [[Gulf of Chardon]] to the northeast, the [[Emerald Bay]] and the [[Nevos Sea]] to the southeast, and the [[Endless Ocean]] to the west. The [[Old Chardon Canal]] runs through the base of the peninsula, providing a shipping route between the [[Nevos Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Chardon]]. 

The northern interior of the peninsula is dominated by wild lands of rough mountains, with deep valleys dotted with forests, where few people live. 

The northwestern coast, along the [[Gulf of Chardon]], is part of the [[Chardonian Empire]], and is made up of three provinces: [[Portalia]], [[Cedrano]], and [[Raziolo]].
