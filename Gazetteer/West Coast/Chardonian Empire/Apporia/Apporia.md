Apporia, or the Apporian Peninsula, is a very large peninsula that stretches west from the area between the [[Yeraad River Basin]] and the [[Chasa River Valley]], and surrounded by the [[Gulf of Chardon]] to the northeast, the [[Emerald Bay]] and the [[Nevos Sea]] to the southeast, and the [[Endless Ocean]] to the west. The [[Old Chardon Canal]] runs through the base of the peninsula, providing a shipping route between the [[Nevos Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Chardon]]. The northern interior of the peninsula is dominated by wild lands of rough mountains, with deep valleys dotted with forests, where few people live. The Gulf of Chardon coast, stretching about 540 miles from the salt marshes around the canal mouth to the northern tip of the peninsula, is rich in trade and agriculture. 
## Settlement

The northwestern coast, along the [[Gulf of Chardon]], is part of the [[Chardonian Empire]], and is made up of three provinces: [[Portalia]], [[Cedrano]], and [[Raziolo]]. While the Chardonian legions have a strong presence in Portalia, and the governor of Portalia is typically hand-picked by the Magistros, the further provinces (Cedrano and especially Raziolo) are substantially autonomous. 

Beyond humans, the northwestern coast of Apporia has significant halfling communities, and a number of small lizardfolk villages, especially west of the [[Old Chardon Canal]], on the swampy borders between [[Portalia]] and [[Cedrano]]. Few dwarves and stoneborn remain on Apporia since the [[War of the Dark Rift]], and unlike most places in Taelgar, there are more stoneborn than dwarves. Those of these species who do remain often live among humans.

**Coastal Region of the Northern Peninsula**

The northern coast of the Chardonian Peninsula boasts a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters, fostering an agricultural landscape dotted with terraced farms and olive groves. The inhabitants, loyal subjects of the Chardonian Empire, have skillfully adapted to the coastal terrain, erecting their settlements atop the rugged cliffs that overlook the Endless Ocean. These cliffs are interrupted sporadically by narrow beaches and estuaries, where the locals have cultivated vineyards, producing wines renowned throughout the empire for their quality. Influenced by a cool maritime current, the coastal waters are exceptionally rich in marine life, supporting vast kelp forests akin to those found off the coast of California. This abundance not only underpins the local economy through fishing but also contributes to the rich biodiversity, including a variety of fish, mollusks, and crustaceans, which are staples of the local diet.

**Maritime Culture and Economy**

The marine culture is deeply ingrained in the coastal society of the Chardonian Peninsula. The cool current's contribution to the richness of the adjacent waters has led to a thriving maritime economy, with towns and villages along the coast engaged in fishing, kelp harvesting, and trade. These settlements, while autonomous, are integral parts of the greater Chardonian Empire, paying tribute to the Emperor in Chardon, the eminent city across the bay. The sea is considered a bountiful yet treacherous provider, as the dense kelp forests that offer shelter to sea life can also conceal hazards to navigation. Consequently, the Chardonians are not only skilled farmers and vintners but also adept sailors and shipbuilders, boasting a navy that secures their trade routes and defends their prosperous shores.

**Interior Highlands and Rainforests**

The interior of the peninsula presents a stark contrast to the coast, with a series of rugged valleys, steep terrain, and a few isolated high plateaus. This region experiences greater rainfall than the coastal areas, creating conditions akin to a temperate rainforest with dense, lush vegetation. The highlands are sparsely populated due to their inaccessibility and the harsh living conditions. Settlement is hindered by the rough terrain, with its deep ravines and precipitous mountains, often shrouded in mists. These lands remain largely uncharted, with tales of hidden valleys and mysterious creatures that discourage exploration. The few brave souls who have ventured into these hinterlands speak of ancient ruins and untamed wilds, holding secrets from an age long past, guarded by the very landscape itself.
