Cedrano is a rocky coastal province in the [[Chardonian Empire]], one of the three Apporian Provinces, located on the northwest coast of the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]], across the [[Gulf of Chardon]] from [[Chardon]]. 

This is a land of rocky cliffs and tiny fishing villages nestled in small harbors. The interior is almost entirely uninhabited, dominated by rough mountainous terrain, with the exception of the Kedron river valley, which is dotted with some small villages and gives the province its name. The only significant city in Cedrano is [[Castrella]], at the mouth of the [[Kedron]] river. 

Cedrano was largely overrun during the [[War of the Dark Rift]], and [[Castrella]] was besieged but never sacked. It was incorporated into the growing [[Chardonian Empire]] shortly after the end of the war, in DR 1599, but granted significant autonomy. 

%% notes

This province is dominated by the rocky coastline, where the interior highlands almost reach the coast, and by the Kedron River Valley. Also not a ton of agriculture, but rich silver mines and marine bounty. This is like the Italian rocky coastline, Amalfi or Cinque Terre. Major settlement might be like Genoa. 

Possible village names: Ombraforte
