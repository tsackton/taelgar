#### North Chardon Coast

- Needs a name - long stretch of smooth sandy beaches running 800 miles north of Chardon
    
- Sandy beaches, leading to land of rivers and farms and pastures, breadbasket of Chardon
    
- Small stands of ancestral forests but mostly land with a long history of agriculture
    
- Land slopes up to low hills maybe 150-200 miles inland
    
- Relatively few big cities; perhaps one or two in the north? Not sure yet about urbanization in this area.
    
- Parts of this were once prosperous Northlander/Drankorian kingdoms, wiped out in Great War and/or quickly conquered by Chardon
