# The Endless Ocean
>[!info]+ Summary
> an ocean in [[Taelgar]]

The Endless Ocean is the name given to the ocean that stretches west of Chardon. Some say one can sail west so far as to arrive at the eastern shores of the [[Green Sea]]. Others claim the ocean is truly endless, or that eventually you sail into the border realms between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. 

Whether there are lost islands or strange lands far across the Endless Ocean is not recorded by  scholars.
