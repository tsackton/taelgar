%% some secrets still linger about the oceans... %%

The Endless Ocean is the name given to the ocean that stretches west from the [[Greater Chardon]], forming the primary coastline of the [[Chardonian Empire]], the [[Mawar Confederacy]], and other places in the region. 

Some say one can sail west so far as to arrive at the eastern shores of the [[Green Sea]]. Others claim the ocean is truly endless, or that eventually you sail into the border realms between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. 

Whether there are lost islands or strange lands far across the Endless Ocean is not recorded by scholars.
