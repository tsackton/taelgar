# Uzgukhar

Major buildings include the palace, a large cattle market, a hall of the ancestors, and the plaza of freedom.

Buildings are mud bricks, but in Uzgukar, the buildings have been adorned with colorful murals and intricate carvings, depicting scenes from Xurkhazi folklore and legends. The city's palace, located at the center of the city, is a stunning example of this style, with towering mud walls, adorned with golden ornaments, and vibrant murals of fey creatures adorning the entryway. The palace is home to the ruling clan of [[Xurkhaz]].

Hall of ancestors - a large, imposing structure made of sandstone, adorned with intricate carvings depicting their [[feywild]] heritage and the legends of their ancestors.

Inside the temple, there could be a large central hall where the orcs gather for ceremonies and offerings to their spirits or deities. The hall might be dimly lit by flickering torches, creating an otherworldly atmosphere that reinforces the orcs' connection to the [[feywild]]. There could also be smaller, private chambers branching off from the central hall where the priests and shamans conduct their rituals and commune with the spirits.

Outside the temple, there could be a large courtyard where the orcs gather for festivals and other celebrations. The courtyard might be decorated with colorful banners and streamers, and there could be a large bonfire at its center, symbolizing the orcs' connection to the elemental forces of fire and the [[feywild]].

Plaza of Freedom is a central square / monument to all orcs that suffer and die at [[Thark]]'s hand, and also to the refugees who kept the dream of [[Xurkhaz]] alive in the dark years when the cloak was missing. 

Most of the other buildings in Uzgukar are modest, low-lying structures with flat roofs, built using adobe bricks or sun-baked clay. They are usually clustered together around small courtyards, and some have rooftop gardens or patios shaded by awnings made of colorful textiles. The city's main market is a maze of narrow streets and alleys, with small shops and stalls selling everything from fresh produce to handcrafted goods. The market is surrounded by a high wall, with several gates leading in and out, and is only open during daylight hours. Overall, the architecture of Uzgukar is functional and practical, with a few notable exceptions that showcase the orcs' artistic and cultural achievements.

Major craft center and economic engine, and really only large urban conglomeration. 

Home to king and advisors.
