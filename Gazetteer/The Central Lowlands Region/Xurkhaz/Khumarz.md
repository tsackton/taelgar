# Khumarz

Dominated by walls, watchtowers.

Khumarz is a fortified border town that serves as a vital outpost for the kingdom of [[XurKhaz]]. Situated on the banks of the Kulthul River, it guards the western border of the kingdom against the dangers of the [[Plaguelands]]. The town is enclosed by high walls made of thick stone, with watchtowers strategically placed along the ramparts to provide a clear view of the surrounding wilderness. The gates of Khumarz are guarded by heavily armed orcs, ever-vigilant against any threat that might arise from the cursed land beyond.

The town's buildings are simple and functional, designed for defense and survival rather than aesthetic appeal. Houses are constructed of stone and wood, with few decorations or adornments. The streets are narrow and winding, allowing for quick and efficient movement through the town in case of an attack. The central marketplace is the liveliest part of the town, with traders selling weapons, armor, and other necessities for survival in the dangerous wilderness.

Despite the harsh conditions and constant threat of danger, the people of Khumarz are a resilient and hardy folk. They are fiercely loyal to their homeland, and take great pride in their role as defenders of the kingdom. The town is home to a garrison of skilled soldiers, all well-trained in the art of combat and survival in the wilderness. 

In DR 1748, Khumarz was largely destroyed and completely depopulated by [[Grash]]'s army of undead/
