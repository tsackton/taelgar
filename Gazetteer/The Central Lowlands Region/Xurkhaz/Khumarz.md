# Khumarz

Khumarz is a fortified border town that serves as a vital outpost for the kingdom of [[XurKhaz]]. Situated on the banks of the Kulthul River, it guards the western border of the kingdom against the dangers of the [[Plaguelands]]. The town is enclosed by high walls made of thick stone, with watchtowers strategically placed along the ramparts to provide a clear view of the surrounding wilderness. The gates of Khumarz are guarded by heavily armed [[orcs]], ever-vigilant against any threat that might arise from the cursed land beyond. The town's buildings are simple and functional, designed for defense and survival rather than aesthetic appeal. 

In DR 1748, Khumarz was largely destroyed and completely depopulated by [[Grash]]'s army of undead.
