# Xurkhaz

(zurk - kaz)

XurKhaz, the Land of the Peaceful Sun, is the kingdom of the [[People of the Rainbow]].
## Overview

Xurkhaz is roughly a triangle, wedged between the Kulthul and the Drogar rivers (Orcish names - these are the west branch and central branch of the Mahar, to the Dunmari). The borders of Xurkhaz start in the northeast at a point on the Drogar about 120 miles north of the confluence, where the terrain on the east bank rises sharply into a series of jagged, broken hills, and the river rushes through a series of waterfalls and gorges. It follows the line of the Drogar south, remaining on the western bank until the hills to the east flatten into dry, cracked plains, about 60 miles north of the confluence. Here the river valley itself is hospitable, and the [[Orcs]] of XurKhaz settle both sides of the Drogar densely, continuing south to a point about 40 miles downriver of the confluence with the Kulthul. Here, the river turns and flows slowly through sandy deserts, and the [[Orcs]] have not tried to settle further south. 

To the west, the territory of the [[Orcs]] follows the course of the Kulthul, which forms a defensible eastern border against the dangers of the [[Plaguelands]] (to the east, the jagged hills protect the settlements on the eastern banks of the Drogar). 

The heart of the kingdom is the land between the two rivers, which is heavily irrigated; the land is more densely settled to the east, and especially the western banks of the Drogar. 

Generally a dry, arid land of rolling hills, sustained by heavy irrigation and desert-adapted, long-horned cattle. Cattle and wheat are prominent in both the culture and the landscape.

## Settlements

There are four notable settlements, although most of the population is heavily rural living in small farming and herding villages:

- [[Uzgukhar]], the capitol, at the confluence of the Drogar and Kulthul
- [[Khumarz]], a fortified border town on the eastern banks of the Kulthul
- Drogoloth, a mining town on the western banks of the Drogar, near the hills and at the furthest point north boats can travel on the Drogar before hitting the rapids
- Gorzum, a peaceful trading oasis in the middle of the country

While these are "towns", only the capitol has more than 1000 people living it in. Total population of the country is maybe 20,000 [[Orcs]], of which ~80% are rural (~16,000), ~1500 live in the capitol, ~500 live in each of the "major" towns, and other ~500 live in planned border forts. Most of the rural population lives in numerous (~200) small villages of 50-100 people.

## People

Generally most [[Orcs]] are very wary of outsiders, and especially suspicious of [[Humans]], [[Elves|elves]], and [[Dwarves]]. Especially paranoid now, given rumors of war on the western border, scouts reporting undead army on the move, etc.

Mostly speak Orcish; a few speak Common or Sylvan, so communication not trivial except via Tongues. 

Common "villager" types: cattle herder, farmer, brewer, leatherworker
Common "fort" types: solider, blacksmith, sergeant

No taverns to speak of, outside the cities. Villages are too small, forts too specialized.
