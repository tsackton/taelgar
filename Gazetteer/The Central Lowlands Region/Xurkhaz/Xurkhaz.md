# XurKhaz

(zurk - kaz)

XurKhaz, the Land of the Peaceful Sun, is the kingdom of the Free Orcs of Uzgash's Horde. 

## Overview

XurKhaz is roughly a triangle, wedged between the Kulthul and the Drogar rivers (Orcish names - these are the west branch and central branch of the Mahar, to the Dunmari). The borders of the orc's territory start in the northeast at a point on the Drogar about 120 miles north of the confluence, where the terrain on the east bank rises sharply into a series of jagged, broken hills, and the river rushes through a series of waterfalls and gorges. It follows the line of the Drogar south, remaining on the western bank until the hills to the east flatten into dry, cracked plains, about 60 miles north of the confluence. Here the river valley itself is hospitable, and the orcs of XurKhaz settle both sides of the Drogar densely, continuing south to a point about 40 miles downriver of the confluence with the Kulthul. Here, the river turns and flows slowly through sandy deserts, and the orcs have not tried to settle further south. 

To the west, the territory of the orcs follows the course of the Kulthul, which forms a defensible eastern border against the dangers of the Plaguelands (to the east, the jagged hills protect the settlements on the eastern banks of the Drogar). 

The heart of the kingdom is the land between the two rivers, which is heavily irrigated; the land is more densely settled to the east, and especially the western banks of the Drogar. 

Generally a dry, arid land of rolling hills, sustained by heavy irrigation and desert-adapted, long-horned cattle. Cattle and wheat are prominent in both the culture and the landscape.

## Settlements

There are four notable settlements, although most of the population is heavily rural living in small farming and herding villages:
- Uzgukar, the capitol, at the confluence of the Drogar and Kulthul
- Khumarz, a fortified border town on the eastern banks of the Kulthul
- Drogoloth, a mining town on the western banks of the Drogar, near the hills and at the furthest point north boats can travel on the Drogar before hitting the rapids
- Gorzum, a peaceful trading oasis in the middle of the country

While these are "towns", only the capitol has more than 1000 people living it in. Total population of the country is maybe 20,000 orcs, of which ~80% are rural (~16,000), ~1500 live in the capitol, ~500 live in each of the "major" towns, and other ~500 live in planned border forts. Most of the rural population lives in numerous (~200) small villages of 50-100 people.

### Uzgukar

Major buildings include the palace, a large cattle market, a hall of the ancestors, and the plaza of freedom.

Buildings are mud bricks, but in Uzgukar, the buildings have been adorned with colorful murals and intricate carvings, depicting scenes from XurKhazi folklore and legends. The city's palace, located at the center of the city, is a stunning example of this style, with towering mud walls, adorned with golden ornaments, and vibrant murals of fey creatures adorning the entryway. The palace is home to the ruling clan of XurKhaz, and adventurers may find themselves being hired by the clan to undertake quests and missions.

Hall of ancestors - a large, imposing structure made of sandstone, adorned with intricate carvings depicting their feywild heritage and the legends of their ancestors.

Inside the temple, there could be a large central hall where the orcs gather for ceremonies and offerings to their spirits or deities. The hall might be dimly lit by flickering torches, creating an otherworldly atmosphere that reinforces the orcs' connection to the feywild. There could also be smaller, private chambers branching off from the central hall where the priests and shamans conduct their rituals and commune with the spirits.

Outside the temple, there could be a large courtyard where the orcs gather for festivals and other celebrations. The courtyard might be decorated with colorful banners and streamers, and there could be a large bonfire at its center, symbolizing the orcs' connection to the elemental forces of fire and the feywild.

Plaza of Freedom is a central square / monument to all orcs that suffer and die at Thark's hand, and also to the refugees who kept the dream of XurKhaz alive in the dark years when the cloak was missing. 

Most of the other buildings in Uzgukar are modest, low-lying structures with flat roofs, built using adobe bricks or sun-baked clay. They are usually clustered together around small courtyards, and some have rooftop gardens or patios shaded by awnings made of colorful textiles. The city's main market is a maze of narrow streets and alleys, with small shops and stalls selling everything from fresh produce to handcrafted goods. The market is surrounded by a high wall, with several gates leading in and out, and is only open during daylight hours. Overall, the architecture of Uzgukar is functional and practical, with a few notable exceptions that showcase the orcs' artistic and cultural achievements.

Major craft center and economic engine, and really only large urban conglomeration. 

Home to king and advisors. 
### Khumarz

Dominated by walls, watchtowers.

Khumarz is a fortified border town that serves as a vital outpost for the kingdom of XurKhaz. Situated on the banks of the Kulthul River, it guards the western border of the kingdom against the dangers of the Plaguelands. The town is enclosed by high walls made of thick stone, with watchtowers strategically placed along the ramparts to provide a clear view of the surrounding wilderness. The gates of Khumarz are guarded by heavily armed orcs, ever-vigilant against any threat that might arise from the cursed land beyond.

The town's buildings are simple and functional, designed for defense and survival rather than aesthetic appeal. Houses are constructed of stone and wood, with few decorations or adornments. The streets are narrow and winding, allowing for quick and efficient movement through the town in case of an attack. The central marketplace is the liveliest part of the town, with traders selling weapons, armor, and other necessities for survival in the dangerous wilderness.

Despite the harsh conditions and constant threat of danger, the people of Khumarz are a resilient and hardy folk. They are fiercely loyal to their homeland, and take great pride in their role as defenders of the kingdom. The town is home to a garrison of skilled soldiers, all well-trained in the art of combat and survival in the wilderness. 
### Drogoloth

### Gorzum

## People

Generally most orcs are very wary of outsiders, and especially suspicious of humans, elves, and dwarves. Especially paranoid now, given rumors of war on the western border, scouts reporting undead army on the move, etc.

Mostly speak Orcish; a few speak Common or Sylvan, so communication not trivial except via Tongues. 

Common "villager" types: cattle herder, farmer, brewer, leatherworker
Common "fort" types: solider, blacksmith, sergeant

No taverns to speak of, outside the cities. Villages are too small, forts too specialized.

### In Uzgukar

#### Chief Lubash

The current ruler of Xurkhaz. An older man, probably in his late 50s, bald, with pale green skin, a hard, long face, and a large nose. Childless, unmarried. Came the throne 3 years ago, when his older brother, wife, and nephew were killed by a band of maundering hill giants while on a royal tour of the kingdom. 

Deeply protective of his surviving nephew, Uzgul, son of his younger sister who died of sickness when Uzgul was young. 

Intensely proud of Xurkhaz. Deeply mistrustful of gods.

%%SECRET[4]%%

Speaks Common, Sylvan, Orcish, and Giant.

#### Chiefling Uzgul

A young man of 14, current heir to the kingdom. The family resemblance to Lubash is apparent, but Uzgul is full of the vigor of youth, with a mohawk of wiry black hair, a dangling silver earring on a chain in one ear, and vibrant green skin. He has a nervous excitement to him, and has a hard time sitting still.

Believes the orcs of Xurkhaz can do anything, and will have no sense of the danger Grash poses. 

Speaks Common and Sylvan.

#### General Murook

A woman in her prime, wearing chain mail, with a well-worn sword at her side. Silent, but has an unusual history - she was born to one of the roaming orc tribes in the Plaguelands, and suffered the rituals to bind her to Thark. Her tribe was slaughtered by Lubash's father, Karguk, but he saw something in her -- she fell silent, and lay down her weapons, when she came under the influence of the cloak, instead of gnashing and raging and going into a frenzy of violence, as many orcs do. 

Karguk took her back to Xurkhaz, and slowly taught her to walk free of Thark's influence, although she still feels the pull of the curse, some days. 

She will not speak of this, unless she fully trusts the party, or it is needed to convince them of what the orcs want. She is almost embarrassed by it, feeling she is somehow lesser for having been touched by Thark in the first place. 

She is also the unofficial leader of the Hezguli, the reborn, the community of orcs in Xurkhaz who were born outside and freed from Thark's influence by the cloak. 
#### Loremaster Azogar

An old man, early 70s. Dark green skin, almost black in patches. Long, but thinning white hair. Frail, walks with a cane. Wears simple robes. Speaks with a wavering voice, but clear and precise. Uses phrase "To be precise" a lot. 

Very knowledgable, can tell many stories and history. Low level wizard magic. Greatly respects Lubash and will look to him for acknowledgement before revealing anything to outsiders. 

### In Khumarz

#### Commander Vorgaz

A bitter man of about 40. Extremely skilled warrior, but gruff and unpersonable. Genuinely brilliant tactician, but bad at politics and readily makes enemies, so not really welcome in the "high society" world of Uzgukar. Looks down on the kings who sit on their throne and don't fight - attitude seems a little too "orcish" for Uzgukar. But Vorgaz believes can't beat em if you don't fight like them. Pounds fist for emphasis.  Dead, killed by Grash's armies.
