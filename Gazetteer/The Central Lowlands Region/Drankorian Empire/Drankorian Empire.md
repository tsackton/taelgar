## The Drankorian Empire

The Drankorian Empire was a vast, continent-spanning empire that stretched from the Endless Ocean to the [[The Green Sea|Green Sea]] and ruled over much of humanity during the millenia following [[the Downfall]] of [[Hkar]]. The Drankorian Empire was known for its strength in magic; the battle mages of [[Drankor]] not only protected the Empire from magical and extraplanar threats but also meant that few could stand against the full might of the Empire in battle. A civilization rich in scholarly traditions, [[Drankor]] was filled with learned societies, organizations dedicated to magical lore.

A rough timeline, in the Dwarven reckoning, of major dates in the history of [[Drankor]] is below:

- 4133 (1 DR): The city of [[Drankor]] is founded by refugees from [[Hkar]] fleeing the wars of [[The Downfall]]
- 4302 (169 DR): Celadir is proclaimed the first Emperor of [[Drankor]]
- circa 4500 (circa 365 DR): The Empire assimilates [[Sembara]] and the northern border at the [[River Volta|Volta]] river is established
- circa 4700 (circa 565 DR): The Empire expands in the west, reaching as far north as Lake Valandros
- circa 4750 - 5100 (circa 615 - 965 DR): The Golden Age of [[Drankor]], 350 years of peace and prosperity
- circa 5100 (965 DR): The Drankorian civil war
- circa 5100 - 5150: Expansionist wars of mixed success, until [[Emperor Apollyon|Apollyon]] takes the throne
- 5192 (1059 DR): The destruction of [[Drankor]] by the Plague Mist
