### The Tokra Archives

The archives are a large square building with a significant tower rising 100 feet above the city, across the Dharajun Plaza from the temple. Also constructed during the early years of the Dharajun dynasty, this building suffered more damage during the [[Fire War]] than the temple, and was reconstructed in the simpler, less ostentatious, more flowing, melancholic, and organic style of post-Great-War Dunmari architecture.

Currently, the archives hold historical records from the pre-[[Great War]] era [[Dunmar]], with a focus on military and religious records from the Dharajun dynasty. They also hold contemporary records of the eastern army of [[Dunmar]] during the post-Great-War period, and some other contemporary scholarship, although contemporary religious and civil administration records are kept in the temple complex.

The archives also have small holdings of books on history pre-dating Dunmari, especially Drankorian history, as well as collected records of the [[Great War]] assembled by archivists in the years after [[Mavdyr]]'s invasion and the [[Fire War]].

Access to the archives is restricted, controlled formally by [[Kaleha]], the Head Priest of [[Tokra]], but in practice by [[Ardan]], the Chief Archivist.
