### Darshana's

On the west side of town, outside the walls, a large, open caravanserai that handles much of the merchant traffic, and serves as a significant marketplace for out of towners and travelers who don't pay the fees to sell in the market squares in town. Rooms, shops, stables.

A notable gathering place for Dunmari as well, a bit more rough-and-ready than the tea shops in town. Popular with ex-soliders.
