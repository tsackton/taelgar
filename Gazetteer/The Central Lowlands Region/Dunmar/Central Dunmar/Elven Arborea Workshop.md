# Ruined Elven Workshop

Under the [[Lakan Monastery]] is the ruins of an ancient elven workshop, which is located on a weak point where the energy of [[Arborea]] leaks into the material plane.

## History
Thousands of years ago, when [[Dunmar]] was a great elven forest, there was a low hill where the [[Lakan Monastery]] is now, and at the center of the hill was a place where the connection to the outer plane of [[Arborea]], a place of wild, uncontrolled nature, was particularly strong.

The elves dug a cave system to protect and study this place, tending the strange creatures that would spring from the planar weakness, and guarding the outside world from the unrestrained influence of [[Arborea]].

When the elven kingdom fell, this place fell into ruin, and was lost, the entrance collapsed.

- (DR:: 1194) The Lakan monastery is founded on a small hill, south of Tokra and on top of a long-ruined elven workshop associated with an [[extraplanar weak point]] connecting to the plane of [[Arborea]]
- (DR:: 1387) Lakan monks excavate the elven cave system underneath their monastery, and discover the [[extraplanar weak point]]
