# Ikram's Caravanserai

On the northern outskirts of town stands a caravanserai, a large square building with a open courtyard, rooms for travelers, and space for merchants and animals. This is a center of commence in the village when the market is deserted, and many things can be acquired from [[Ikram]], the proprietor. 

Largely destroyed in the gnoll attacks. A new caravanserai is under construction, larger and better fortified. 

Menu notes:
For drinks, these days it is typically either a sweet, chilled honey wine or a spiced beer (less traditional), although he also serves sharba, a popular Dunmari vodka-style drink fermented from milk. Food tends towards grilled meat (goat or sheep), kebabs, and stews, with some quick breads and the occasional noodle.
