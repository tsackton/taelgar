### Kharsan

Once a major Dunmari city, now a ruin controlled by the undead warrior [[Grash]]. 

Set on the banks of the now-dry river [[Kharja]]. Much of the city, especially the northern sections, are in complete ruins. However, the palace square and the administration complex around it remain standing, as does the old stadium in the southern part of the city. 

Across the river from the city are cliffs on which stand two lines of massive monuments, north and south of the road. These are the Samraat Tombs, monuments to the rulers of the first dynasty of [[Dunmar]], the [[Aatmaji dynasty]]. 

Although of varying sizes and designs, all share some common architectural features:
-   Five sided step pyramids / ziggurats, with steps/"arms" reaching out from the main base
-   A statue, temple, pyramid, something on top of the complex
-   A chapel/burial chamber underneath
