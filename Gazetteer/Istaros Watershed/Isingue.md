The now-ruined city on the [[Istaros]], once the cultural and spiritual capitol of the [[Istabor Alliance]]. 

Legends and stories say that Isingue was founded where the waters of the [[Istaros]] gave magical, life-giving energy to the land and to the people who drank them, and it was from this magic that the densely settled small towns and villages near Isingue drew their wealth. 

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] discovered that the ruined city of Isingue seems to be currently occupied by some kind of acidic ooze monster, capable of flinging acidic globules strong enough to eat away at stone from hundreds of feet away.

%% notes from Discord below

Something about the waters of the river near / in Insignue has healing and fertility properties. This works on soil too so the land is unusually rich. This attracts folks, but a rejection of the Drankorian ritual study leads the people who come here to be much more mystical/divine magic so a university doesn’t develop but the town becomes a cult center for [[Mos Numena]] and a place of divine connection. This is never large, but there is plenty of wealth in the soil, and the small towns are all attached very strongly to the place they get the magic plant growing (and [[Humans|human]] fertility causing) water. This generates a lot of wealth and a cultural focus (and an interesting magical twist, did Cha’mutte corrupt the healing power? Or suppress it?)

But the rejection of [[Drankorian Empire|drankor]] leads to a lot of New England style town meetings and local rule, united by this shared heritage / culture / economic / magical connection back to the source of the water

perhaps [[The Rangers]] could also have an insinguese root, maybe originally as the guardians of these magical waters

they existed in the high school campaign so need to have a pre-Great-War origin story
and also a reason to be heavily focused specifically on the southern border of [[Sembara]]

[[The Rangers]] might be originally and at heart the guardians of the magic of the land, not the cultural trappings of the city
So reclaiming the town - Who cares
Reclaiming the magic - Key
And if it seemed important for them to be on a side, [[Beryl]] could have told them whether reclaiming the water is possible
