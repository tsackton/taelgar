The now-ruined city on the [[Istaros]], once the cultural and spiritual capitol of the [[Istabor Alliance]]. 

Legends and stories say that Isingue was founded where the waters of the [[Istaros]] gave magical, life-giving energy to the land and to the people who drank them, and it was from this magic that the densely settled small towns and villages near Isingue drew their wealth. 

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] discovered that the ruined city of Isingue seems to be currently occupied by some kind of acidic ooze monster, capable of flinging acidic globules strong enough to eat away at stone from hundreds of feet away. 
%%^End%%

%% notes from Discord below

Something about the waters of the river near / in Insignue has healing and fertility properties. This works on soil too so the land is unusually rich. This attracts folks, but a rejection of the Drankorian ritual study leads the people who come here to be much more mystical/divine magic so a university doesn’t develop but the town becomes a cult center for [[Mos Numena]] and a place of divine connection. This is never large, but there is plenty of wealth in the soil, and the small towns are all attached very strongly to the place they get the magic plant growing (and [[Humans|human]] fertility causing) water. This generates a lot of wealth and a cultural focus (and an interesting magical twist, did Cha’mutte corrupt the healing power? Or suppress it?)

But the rejection of [[Drankorian Empire|drankor]] leads to a lot of New England style town meetings and local rule, united by this shared heritage / culture / economic / magical connection back to the source of the water

perhaps [[The Rangers]] could also have an insinguese root, maybe originally as the guardians of these magical waters

they existed in the high school campaign so need to have a pre-Great-War origin story
and also a reason to be heavily focused specifically on the southern border of [[Sembara]]

[[The Rangers]] might be originally and at heart the guardians of the magic of the land, not the cultural trappings of the city
So reclaiming the town - Who cares
Reclaiming the magic - Key
And if it seemed important for them to be on a side, [[Beryl]] could have told them whether reclaiming the water is possible

%% discord conversation

our assumption is Insingue was a pretty fertile and wealthy agricultural region, right? before the plague it would have been like southern france or tuscany or something, I guess, although perhaps a bit more rain

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:04 PM

Yeah, wealthy and fertile for sure. Big trade with Cymea and Sembara and perhaps even out to Chardon.

In high school it was around where Beryl was from

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:05 PM

right

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:06 PM

It has always been a bit of a cipher though

Like, why is there a big city there? Was it more cymean or sembaran?

I think in the Drankorian expansion notes there were not many humans in the region when drankor expanded into it

I always imagine it as river town

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:08 PM

yes, definitely a river town

I always thought of it as kind of Drankorian but always like the second city of the empire, that survived the plague and rebuilt but took on a kind of independent spirit

the scholars fled west, the merchants fled to cymea, and the pioneers fled to insingue

maybe it was protected from the first plague that destroyed drankor by some powerful magic so it has this kind of refuge in a land of devastation feeling right after the fall of the drankorian empire

but had always been kind of a hotbed of anti-imperial sentiment (maybe some simmering remnants of the pre-Apolloyon civil war there)

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:11 PM

Independence is a good key idea, it certainly fits in with the refugee culture in Maseau and south I’ve very lightly developed

Maybe a free trade place as well

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:13 PM

insingue to drankor is almost exactly the distance from rome to cairo. could have a kind of eyppt during roman times vibe

close enough you can get grain shipments down the river and trade, but far enough away it isn't directly under the imperial thumb

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:15 PM

It also could have been completely different during the Drankorian times. Maybe before the plague it was a sleepy river port funneling grain south to drankor from (one of?) the breadbasket of the empire

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:16 PM

right, doesn't necessarily matter that far back

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:17 PM

Then some historically contingent set of leaders escapes the plague to Insingue and it gets this reputation as something else — an anti-imperial / we are very much not drankor rebirth

But in reality this is a contrast with Cymea not Drankor

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:17 PM

right, the important thing is that in the east Cymea initially has the kind of Drankor-continued vibe and Isingue is explicitly not that

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:18 PM

Yeah

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:19 PM

but i think its wealth would be from agriculture more than trade - it is on an important river and at a crossroads of cymea/sembara trade to dunmar and on to chardon, but as it is completely landlocked it is hard for it to be a really major trading power

my mental model is kind of southern france

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:20 PM

You could imagine three major post Drankorian urban cultures—

Chardon is the “we will become greater than even our Drankorian roots” culture, Cymea the “relish the past, we will never improve on it” culture, and Insingue is the “we are nothing at all like Drankor, we reject its principles” culture

By why a big city in southern france? Or maybe insignue is not very urban and it is the dense agricultural land not the city itself that matters (as the city is small)

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:22 PM

I don't think of insingue as particularly a big city

i think the river valley would be densely settled with many small towns, so fairly high population density, but not sure that insingue would really be a huge city by itself

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:24 PM

Yeah actually that makes sense

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:24 PM

maybe historically the region was called something different, but Insingue is a symbol and now has kind of a "well are all insinguese" vibe

I think I had the name Isatabor Alliance somewhere

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:25 PM

I was thinking similar but also that maybe Insingue was major (intellectual/religious/magical?) focus so everyone in the region saw it as something important

Yeah I think that was the name of the region

/ political entity

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:27 PM

right, Insingue was a center, no doubt, and kind of a cultural capital, but not necessarily hugely populated

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:28 PM

Right I think that works well

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:38 PM

How about Revelfire for a name for the twilight revelry / wyrdling one?

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:39 PM

I like that well enough. Although I wouldn’t discount fake Latin either

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:40 PM

hmm yeah maybe fake latin woud be better

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:44 PM

On Insignue, here’s one idea…

Something about the waters of the river near / in Insignue has healing and fertility properties. This works on soil too so the land is unusually rich. This attracts folks, but a rejection of the Drankorian ritual study leads the people who come here to be much more mystical/divine magic so a university doesn’t develop but the town becomes a cult center for Mos Numena and a place of divine connection. This is never large, but there is plenty of wealth in the soil, and the small towns are all attached very strongly to the place they get the magic plant growing (and human fertility causing) water

This generates a lot of wealth and a cultural focus (and an interesting magical twist, did Cha’mutte corrupt the healing power? Or suppress it?)

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:46 PM

hmm yeah that is quite interesting

and could explain why the acidic ooze there now has grown so big

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:47 PM

But the rejection of drankor leads to a lot of New England style town meetings and local rule, united by this shared heritage / culture / economic / magical connection back to the source of the water

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:47 PM

probably makes sense to have a bit of a druidic focus, which would also be consistent with beryl's backstory

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:48 PM

Yeah that works

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:49 PM

perhaps the rangers could also have an insinguese root, maybe originally as the guardians of these magical waters

they existed in the high school campaign so need to have a pre-Great-War origin story

and also a reason to be heavily focused specifically on the southern border of Sembara

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:50 PM

I like that

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:51 PM

could also contribute to the cultural relevancy of insigue - this would be the rangers headquarters or mystical center or something

might push the rangers towards the "reclaim isingue" side in your campaign, not sure if that works or not

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:52 PM

I dunno- they could easily see themselves as the guardians of the humans who escaped more than reclaimed land

Perhaps there are factions between those who believe the waters can be restored and those who don’t

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:53 PM

hmm yeah that could be interesting

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:53 PM

The rangers might be originally and at heart the guardians of the magic of the land, not the cultural trappings of the city

So reclaiming the town -

Who cares

Reclaiming the magic -

Key

And if it seemed important for them to be on a side, Beryl could have told them whether reclaiming the water is possible

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:55 PM

maybe beryl thought it was possible and told Rai and the Bhishma monks to try it......................

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:55 PM

That would be awesome

But I’ll let you decide if it really happened 😀

When was Rai and the monks?

It was like 1720s, right?

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:56 PM

1718

Deciusmus — 8/8/23, 10:57 PM

Maybe Rai succeeded and the magical water is now super back and giving major fertility power to the giant acid monster

rsulfuratus — 8/8/23, 10:57 PM

maybe

i'm not sure how big a role the rangers play in your campaign but feel free to have some reverberations echoing back to the rangers via beryl if it make sense
