# The Aurbez and the Andonne

This region is a borderland, caught between the [[Sentinel Range]] to the west and the [[Plaguelands]] to the east. It is a marginal land, with hot, dry summers when the ash-wind blows from the east and cold, dry winters when the westerlies blow over the mountains. The main rainfall is in the spring, when in lucky years several soaking rains will replenish the land, and in the summer when the punishing thunderstorms race from the east, bringing flash floods, lightning, and hail. In autumn the rivers shrink, and the temperature is briefly moderate before the cooler winters come.

Snow is rare, but sometimes a large winter storm will blanket the [[Aurbez Plateau]] for days, and the upper [[Aursen]] can freeze in particularly cold winters. The [[Douren]], however, rushes too fast to freeze even in the coldest winters.

## Borders and Overview
The region is bordered by the [[Plaguelands]] and the [[Darkwood]] in the east, the [[Maseau Gap]] and the [[~Sentinel Range Spur~]] in the north (which forms an informal and shifting border with the [[Duchy of Maseau]]), the [[Sentinel Range]] in the west, and the [[Andonne]] and [[Douren]] rivers in the south. 

The land is lightly populated, but what people there are mostly live along the two rivers: the [[Masance]] and the [[Aursen]]. A significant road, the [[Maseau - Dunmar Road]] also runs through the region, providing a link between [[Sembara]] and the west. Traffic along this road grows every year. 
   
In addition to these rivers, the land is divided into a highland and a lowland. A large plateau, the [[Aurbez Plateau]], stretches out from the mountain foothills from the just east of the headwaters of the [[Masance]] to the headwaters of the [[Douren]]. This highland is gentler than the rest of the region, as the ash storms fall less strongly here, and there is marginally more rain, especially in the southern and western parts of the plateau, where aspens thrive amongst small streams and alpine meadows. The Aurbez plateau drops off rapidly to the east, and beyond the Masance the land flattens significantly into long scrubby grasslands, the [[Andonne Plain]]. The soil here is marginal, but can support grazing, especially north of the [[Andonne]] where the plague ash lies less heavy on the land.

The region is divided into four areas, with different climate and politics.
## The Andonne River
The land along the banks of the [[Andonne]] and further south is largely a no-man’s land. The ash storms are fierce here, and at times the air can get too thick to breath easily. Much of the Andonne itself is corrupted and unsafe to drink, and crops do not grow on its banks. Before the Great War this region was a productive ranching land, and adventurers and treasure seekers occasionally venture into this land – in the winter, mostly, when the ash is less – to see what they can find. Some do not return.
## The Andonne Plains
The central plains is the heartland of the [[March of Andonne]]. Although the formal borders of the march are the [[Andonne|Andonne river]], in practice most of the marcher lords establish fortified ranches in the central plains or along the [[Maseau - Dunmar Road]], where the ash storms are less intense. Cattle and goats are the main livelihood, as crops die too often in the ashy summers. Cattle can be brought inside the great fortified ranches when troubles come from the east and the marcher lords ride out to earn their stipends. The ranches along the road have grown into fortified rest-stops and places of refuge for travelers, and one does not need to camp in the open between [[Cassons]] and the crossing of the [[Masance]]. This is a land of scrubby grasses and small dryland trees.
### The Triangle and the Douren Valley
The land between the Dunmar Road, the Masance, and the Aursen is often referred to locally as the triangle, and is very similar to the Douren River Valley further south. These borderlands, along the Masance, Douren, and eastern Aursen rivers is a mix of marcher castles protecting small scale irrigation-driven farms, goat-and-sheep herders, and self-sufficient frontier farms that depend on hunting, fishing, small vegetable crops and ranching. Mostly claimed by no kingdom but many of the frontier farms are loyal to Aurbez, and the marcher lords are often loyal to Maseau. But the population density (perhaps no more than 2000 people in the whole region) is low enough that there is little conflict. This region is getting safer, and a popular recruiting ground for the Rangers.
### The Aurbez Plateau
The [[Aurbez Plateau]] rises sharply just north of the Dunmar Road, and is the heart of the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]].

The ashen plains (dark red on map). Borderlands of the plaguelands. No real people, but not truly plague-filled. Biggest issue for these places is the polluted Ardonne river and the ash storms. (In 1650 this region would stretch through basically all of the light red region).
 
The central March of Ardonne (light red on map). Ranchers and open grassland. Dry, similar to say western Kansas or eastern Colorado. Ashy summer storms can cause issues for agriculture so most don't try. Fortified ranches are the main settlements. Some dependence on food imports/trade. Most settlements clustered around the Dunmar Road and the ruins of the Great South Road. (This region is unsettled in 1650 except right along the road)

The river borderlands (pale yellow). A mix of marcher castles protecting small scale irrigation-driven farms, goat-and-sheep herders, and self-sufficient frontier farms that depend on hunting, fishing, small vegetable crops and ranching. Mostly claimed by no kingdom but many of the frontier farms are loyal to Aurbez, and the marcher lords are often loyal to Maseau or Sembara. But the population density (perhaps no more than 2000 people in the whole region) is low enough that there is little conflict. (In 1650, there would have been no Marcher castles here, just a handful of frontier folk and refugees)

The Aurbez Plateau (brown). Colorado Front Range climate. The heart of the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez. Biggest settlements are around the marsher upper Aursen before it spills off the plateau in a series of waterfalls just before the road crosses the river. Most of the people are tucked away in the mountains, especially the southern stretches. I'm still not totally sure what form of polity the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez is, but in 1650 it didn't exist, and the people living here were very similar to the frontier folk of the river borderlands.

Additional notes:
Worth also keeping in mind that the Plaguelands is not actually filled with literal red mist these days - this is really the Sembaran name for the region reflecting fear and history. There are hobgoblins trying to make a living in the river valley that drains to the Istaros from Addermarch, for example, and there would be tons of rumors of what is out there -- kind of like the Dunmari frontier, but without the supernatural protection. And weird aberrations and monstrosities sometimes make their way out the heart of the plaguelands to attack. There are probably also stories - even in 1650 and especially 1750 -- of the riches you can find, and probably some complicated feelings about the ruined, abandoned cities. Few of the refugees would have gotten away with all their material wealth so there would literally be lots of riches of the ancestors of the current Aurbez people for those who could survive the dangers. 

Lots of potential for what pollutes the river, too. Is it Abyssal corruption? The ash itself? This could be a magical analog of the idea that diseases can get carried across the Atlantic in giant dust clouds from the Sahara. Or is it damage from the Great War that cannot be easily undone (the Ardonne was filled with the bodies of the dead, so thick you could walk for days on their corpses, that sort of thing). 

  

I hope you are putting this all in a doc somewhere.

**Climate**

The area is dominated by a large mountain chain to the west and the Plaguelands to the east. It is a marginal land, with hot, dry summers when the ash-wind blows from the east and cold, dry winters when the westerlies blow over the mountains. The main rainfall is in the spring, when in lucky years several soaking rains will replenish the land, and in the summer when the punishing thunderstorms race from the east, bringing flash floods, lightning, and hail. In autumn the rivers shrink, and the temperature is briefly moderate before the cooler winters come.

  

The flora and fauna is reminiscent of central Spain or highland Mexico - some elk and bison in the higher regions, pines and sequoias and similar trees, but definitely not a lush New England forest.

  

**People**

The main inhabitants are the Aurbeze (aur-bez-e), named after the Aurbez plateau which rises just to the west of the Last Inn. These people are mostly refugees from the Istabor River valley (which used to be a great fertile river delta until a magical red mist spread over the land and killed everyone who didn't manage to flee. Now it is a dry dusty wasteland with no people but plenty of scary things).

  

They have built small settler communities and fortified ranch houses (think Mexican hacienda complexes) and have started to try to eke a living out of the land, mostly herding goats, some hunting, and a little bit of small-scale farming and fishing nearer the rivers.

  

They also have a decent amount of trade with Sembara driven by explorers and miners who pick through the dwarven ruins for easily accessible metals and ores and ship them north.

  

The main controversy in this community is about their identity: are they the descendants of Insingue (the largest city in the Istabor valley), destined to reclaim their lost greatness? Or are they smallholders, farmers, and herders, just looking to their children and grandchildren's future, making whatever decisions seem best to ensure a peaceful future? Should they be a great power, or a backwater?

  

**History**

The Great War ended 109 years ago when Cha'Mutte was defeated in a great battle just a few hundred miles to the north and east, in the midst of the central mountains.

  

But his defeat didn't magically cause the hobgoblins, demons, devils, orcs, and others he had gathered in his cause to vanish. The next fifty years were known as the Blood Years and were filled with anguish and loss as the human kingdoms slowly stabilized their borders, won and lost battles, etc.

  

This particular region was barren for a couple of years, and as the dwarves fled south in those early years the region would have been awash in chaos. Black storms of unnatural ash falling on the ground for weeks. Hobgoblin armies passing through, fleeing who knows what. Dark things emerging from the old dwarven mines. But in this time a small trickle of humans started fortifying caves up in the mountains, or building small highly fortified villages. They drifted in from the Istabor valley, for the most part, all with various tales about the terrors they fled or faced escaping and finding their way across a wasteland. Some also came in from the south, where the cataclysm of the end of the war had reshaped the very earth, raising a new set of mountains. 

  

But for maybe a generation of humans, these refugees stayed hidden, as did you -- the land was dangerous. But as time passed, and the human kingdoms established themselves, and the plague winds shrunk to mere normal ash, the region started to grow a bit. The original refugees had children, as humans are wont to do, and the land, if not bountiful, was at least empty.

  

The real change has happened in the last 50 years though. Queen Cece of Sembara (recently dead) ushered in an age of peace and prosperity. She built a road through the region, and more settlers started drifting in: not just people with ancient connections to the Istabor valley, who heard rumors of their culture being preserved here, but also anyone looking for a new start, some free land, etc.

  

This time is when the Inn was founded, the mining and metal trade started, and the political controversies above started.
