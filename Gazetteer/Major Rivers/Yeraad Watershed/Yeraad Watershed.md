%% notes
#### Lizardfolk River Basin

- Southern river has several large lizardfolk communities that operate somewhat outside the strictures of the Empire
    
- Border area between Chardon and Dunmar on road to Songara is pretty wild; known as the Myraeni Gap, it is rough, hilly land that has traditionally been under the control of the Myraenians, a mysterious and closed society; in the modern era, they have retreated a bit and [[Kobolds]] are a serious nuisance here
    
- Marshy lowlands along ~LizardFolk River~ is in many ways the effective southwestern border of the Empire, as much of this terrain is a mire of swamps, lizardfolk settlements, and confusing waterways that are hard to cross and navigate. Trade routes tend to run along eaves of the forest, and the old Drankorian bridges no longer span the river.
