The Silverflood is the principal river of Alta Tonaro, draining the mineral‑rich foothills north of the [[Chataan Mountains]]. 

In the late DR 1600s, traces of [[chalyte]] were [[Reports on Chalyte in Alta Tonaro|discovered]] by [[Chardonian Empire|Chardonian]] explorers along the upper Silverflood and its tributaries, igniting a rush that transformed the region, though within a generation the easy lodes and river pans were exhausted, and the area fell from prominence as deeper reserves in the [[Chataan Mountains]] proved too perilous to extract.
