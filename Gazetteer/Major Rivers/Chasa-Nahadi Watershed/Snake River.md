# The Snake River

The Snake River is a long, meandering river that flows east of [[Voltara]] through the grasslands of the [[Erbalta Plains]]. Just north of [[Lake Valandros]] it joins the [[Zarnato]], forming one of the two great drainage branches of the northern [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]].

The Snake River marks the eastern extent of [[Greater Voltara]], and a small Chardonian fort, the [[Snake River Fort]], guards one crossing on the settled edge of the plains. Major tributaries include the [[Kelvaros]] (draining [[Pykolon Lake]]) and the [[Wild River]].

%% possibly the river that runs east of Voltara, joining the Nahadi north of Lake Valandros, but river naming up here is non-canon as indicated by check/name tag%%

%% name could derive from an old Northros river spirit) %%
