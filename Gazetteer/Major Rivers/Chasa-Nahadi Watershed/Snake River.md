# The Snake River

The Snake River is a long, meandering river that flows east of [[Voltara]] through the grasslands of the [[Erbalta Plains]], forming one of the two great drainage branches of the northern [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]]. The Snake River marks the eastern extent of [[Greater Voltara]], and a small [[Chardonian Empire|Chardonian]] fort, the [[Snake River Fort]], guards the one easy crossing. 

Just north of [[Lake Valandros]] it joins the [[Zarnato]]. Major tributaries include the [[Kelvaros]] (draining [[Pykolon Lake]]) and the [[Wild River]].
