The Arqa is a swift-flowing, unnavigable river that cascades down from the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] to join the [[Zarnato]], passing through forests and many ravines over its course.

The name derives from the old Northros word for "hidden". 

%% NOTE

This is the river that joins the [[Zarnato]] from the Sentinels, south of the confluence with the [[Barzhen]].
