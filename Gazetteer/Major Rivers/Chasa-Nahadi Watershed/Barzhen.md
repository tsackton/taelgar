The Barzhen is a slow, muddy river that flows through the [[Blackwater Fens]], and is the primary river that drains this region.

The name derives from the old Northros word for "heavy, slow".

%% NOTE
The hydrology of the [[Blackwater Fens]] is a bit complicated with several small lakes on the map. The Barzhen is intended to be the "major river" of the region, with a source in the mountains to the north and then joined by tributaries from the lakes before exiting the fens.
