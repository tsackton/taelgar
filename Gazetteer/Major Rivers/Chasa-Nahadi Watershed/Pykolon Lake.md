A small lake nestling in a hilly region on the western edge of the [[Erbalta Plains]]; the source of the [[Kelvaros]] and a frequent stop-over place for migrating [[centaurs]]. 

The name derives from the Drankorian for "spring-hill", and is sometimes referred to as Lake Pegokolonos in historical works. 

The tomb of [[Xameia]] the Forsworn is located on this lake, and it is a place with some historical significance to the [[Order of Twilight]].
