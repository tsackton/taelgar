The Zarnato is the largest river of the northern branch of the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], draining the interior of the [[Northern Provinces]] and the western [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]. Just north of [[Lake Valandros]] it is joined by the [[Snake River]], and the combined waters ultimately reach the lake.

The major tributaries of the Zarnato include the [[Barzhen]], the outlet of the [[Blackwater Fens]], and the [[Arqa]], a swift river that descends from the Sentinels through wooded ravines.
