The Chasa is the principal river of the [[Chasa River Valley]]. Rising in the southern reaches of the [[Central Highlands]], it flows west through vast forests before it is joined by the [[Nahadi]] just east of [[Chardon]]. At Chardon, the river spreads into a wide estuary and fertile floodplain beneath [[Mount Nera]].

The Chasa is navigable along its entire length, and the river carries grain, timber, and other goods downriver toward Chardon’s busy port. Numerous tributaries join the Chasa along its course; among the best-known is the [[Kayan]], which flows through the [[Elderwood]] and joins the Chasa near [[Arendum]].

## History

The Chasa and its valley have long been central to Chardon’s growth and security. During the Blood Years, battles were fought on the river’s banks, including the [[Battle of Kin-Aska]]; in later generations, the Chasa Valley became one of the great agricultural heartlands of the [[Chardonian Empire]].
