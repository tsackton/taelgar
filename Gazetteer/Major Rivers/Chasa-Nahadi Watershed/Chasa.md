%%River that flows from the mountains all the way to [[Chardon]].; many notes in OneNote that need to be transferred%%

%%  From old GDrive names document: (derived from old Nothros for holy, Qadis, the name given because the great forest was full of spirits to protect them, per the early lore of the Northerners; Qadis, Qashi, Qadsa; main river flowing past Chardon) %%
