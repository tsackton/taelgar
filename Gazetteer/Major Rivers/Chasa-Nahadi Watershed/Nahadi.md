%% 

(derived from old Northros for mighty river; other ideas Naroh; Arhadi; Naweelill; Taweldi) (branch north to lake and beyond)    

realistically, this should properly refer to only the part south of the lake (or perhaps north of the lake), with another name for the other part. historically very few rivers share a name on both sides of a major river.
