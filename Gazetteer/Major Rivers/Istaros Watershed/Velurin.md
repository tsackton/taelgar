%% Tim: check name and vibe; not totally sure about the forgetfulness thing, could be no Isinguise name or the more straightforward Velorin or Velourne %%
Flowing south from [[Orenlas]], this is known as the "river of the elves" and few reliable reports exist as to its character. It flows into [[Lathirion Lake]] and emerges from the lake as the [[Thalurien|Thalúrien]].

It is said to mean "veiled river" in Elvish and legend says that no mortal can cross it. The Isinguese called it the Velonere, said its dark waters brought forgetfulness, although these stories have mostly been lost since the Great War.
