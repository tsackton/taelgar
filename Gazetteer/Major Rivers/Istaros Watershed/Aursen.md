The Aursen starts in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]] about 50 miles north of the headwaters of the [[Douren|Douren]]. But in character and path, it is very different. The land here is flatter – rocky and with poor soil, but studded with the occasional stand of pines, and the river flows gently and widely for 75 miles, before dropping in a series of large waterfalls off the plateau, to lower ground. The land around the Aursen is marshy and productive, although hard to farm. A small lizardfolk community has lived here since time immemorial, and they are much honored for the welcome and shelter they gave to the first refugees.

# **The Aursen River – Geography and Historical Parallels**

  

## **1. Mountain Headwaters**

  

**Historical Parallel:** _Upper Dee, Scotland (medieval crofting economy)_ — In the medieval Scottish Highlands, high valleys like the upper Dee were home to small, dispersed crofting families who grazed cattle and sheep, fished salmon, and used seasonal shielings (summer pastures) higher up. Poor soils limited grain cultivation, so communities relied heavily on transhumance and preserved dairy products for winter. Political ties were clan-based, with strong local autonomy.

  

**Aurbez Context:** The upper Aursen has always been lightly settled, with lizardfolk and, later, human newcomers using seasonal fishing camps and upland grazing. Like Highland crofters, they maintain strong communal ties and oral agreements on resource use, with the Rangers respecting this as de facto local governance.

## **2. Plateau Marshlands**

  

**Historical Parallel 1:** _Klamath Marsh, Oregon (Klamath peoples)_ — At ~4,000 feet, this snowmelt-fed wetland floods dramatically in spring, covering its meadows under several feet of water. Tule reed boats were essential for fishing and waterfowl hunting. By midsummer, the water receded, revealing rich grazing grounds and peat banks. Winter ice locked the marsh, leaving a brief but vital productive season.

  

**Historical Parallel 2:** _Andean Puna Wetlands (Lake Junín, Peru)_ — At ~13,000 feet, these high-altitude wetlands were central to seasonal pastoralism and fishing. Communities moved herds to graze the exposed grasslands in late summer and autumn, and small raised mounds were used for limited cultivation in drier fringes.

  

**Historical Parallel 3:** _Tibetan Plateau Lacustrine Meadows_ — Seasonal flooding from snowmelt produces lush meadows that support intensive late-summer grazing. Rights to pasture and water are traditionally regulated by local councils, often with ceremonial openings of the grazing season.

  

**Aurbez Context:** The Aursen marshlands are the cultural heartland of the Marsh Lizardfolk, whose seasonal rhythm mirrors that of these real-world upland wetlands. In spring, the basin floods, and travel is entirely by reed boat. By midsummer, peat cutting begins, cattle and ponies are brought in to graze, and humans cultivate hardy crops on the fringes. Autumn fish runs of small silverfish mark a time of shared festivals between lizardfolk and human settlers. The Refounded Alliance maintains a seasonal rights council, held on anchored reed rafts, where disputes over grazing, fishing, and peat banks are resolved.

## **3. Escarpment Falls**

  

**Historical Parallel:** _Celilo Falls, Columbia River (pre-modern indigenous trade hub)_ — Before being flooded by a dam in the 20th century, Celilo Falls was a major fishing and trade site for multiple indigenous nations. The falls themselves were an obstacle to navigation but a magnet for seasonal gathering, where fishing rights were carefully negotiated and enforced. The site had both economic and cultural significance far beyond its immediate geography.

  

**Aurbez Context:** The Aursen Falls are less economically central than Celilo, but they serve as a landmark and symbolic edge of the Refounded Alliance of Aurbez. For lizardfolk storytellers, the falls mark the “river’s leap from the old world to the new.” While not a trading hub, they are a gathering point during certain festivals, with safe ledges above the drop where ceremonial offerings are made.

## **4. Aursen Crossing**

  

**Historical Parallel:** _Regensburg Stone Bridge, Germany (12th century)_ — The stone bridge at Regensburg transformed the city into a key trans-European trade hub, replacing unreliable ferries and ensuring year-round crossing. The control of bridge tolls was a major source of political and economic power, and the bridge itself became a focal point for regional politics and military defense.

  

**Aurbez Context:** Aursen Crossing shifted from a modest ferry hamlet to a bustling market town once the stone bridge was built a generation ago. Like Regensburg, the bridge cemented its role as a control point for trade and movement. The Refounded Alliance uses toll revenue to fund road patrols and maintain influence in the lowlands, and in wartime, “hold the bridge” becomes a rallying cry for defending the plateau’s link to the outside world.
