The Thalúrien flows south from [[Lathirion Lake]] before joining the [[Istaros]] near the ruins of [[Isingue]]. It is formed from three tributaries which all feed the lake: the [[Naithale|Naithalë]] to the west, the central [[Velasse|Velassë]], and the [[Silire|Silírë]] in the east. The Velassë flows from within [[Orenlas]] itself and is little known to outsiders. 

The Isinguese called it the Taloraine, and Isinguese poets would speak of the clarity and purity of its water.

In ancient elvish lore, the Thalúrien was the water of purity, thought, and the sky - sacred to [[Elmerca]], and the Aistanë was the water of growth, and fertility, and the blessings of [[Aldanor]].
