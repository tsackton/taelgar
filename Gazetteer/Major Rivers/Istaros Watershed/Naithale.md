The Naithalë flows south from the [[Mostreve Hills]] to [[Lathirion Lake]] through largely uninhabited and desolate land. It is a border of sorts for the elves, and the elves of [[Orenlas]] rarely cross the Naithalë, or if they do, only with strength of arms and magic.

For many years after the Great War, the red dragon [[Vraedhul]] had a lair in the southern reaches of the Naithalë and smoke and steam would rise from the waters. The lair was destroyed in 1720 during the [[War of the Ashen Horde]] by unknown forces.

### Names
This river is well-known in Tyrwingha, where it is called the Arianrith and often spoke of with fear. Few who see its waters are said to return. Isinguese sources refer to it as the Nimrata, although today the elves speak of it more often than any others.
