Lathirion Lake is a lake in the upper [[Istaros Watershed]]. It is fed by three rivers—the [[Naithale|Naithalë]], the [[Velasse|Velassë]], and the [[Silire|Silírë]]—and from it the [[Thalurien|Thalúrien]] flows south toward the [[Istaros]].

The central tributary, the Velassë, is said to flow from within [[Orenlas]] itself, and thus the lake’s shores are little described in the writings of outsiders.
