Irrla, as it is called by its human inhabitants, is a large mountainous island in the middle of the [[Green Sea]]. It is a temperate island with an oceanic climate, with cool, rainy summers broken by the occasional week of hot dry weather, and cool, damp winters with little snow, except in the interior mountains. Despite its climate and central position, it is lightly settled. The northern and western coasts of Irrla are dangerous and difficult for ships, with shifting shoals and unpredictable currents extending far into the Green Sea. The interior of Irrla is a land of rocky highlands, steep mountains,  deep valleys, and the occasional volcano, making travel difficult in the best of conditions. 

The [[Republic of Svolhas]] occupies the southeastern coast of Irrla, mostly along the fertile strip of agricultural land in the coastal lowlands. These fertile lowlands are bordered to the north and west by the rough, rolling hills of the interior, filled with deep valleys and cascading rivers. The northeastern border of the Republic of Svolhas is heavily fortified by a line of castles, because the eastern point of Irrla is occupied by hobgoblins. These hobgoblins are largely organized into competing pirate clans, who make a living raiding the shipping of the Green Sea.

In the DR 1740s, the [[Skullcleaver Clan]] clan has achieved some degree of lasting dominance over the other hobgoblins, and has increasingly turned its attention to coastal raids. In response, the Republic of Svolhas, not historically a major naval power, has begun to rapidly build up its maritime forces.

%% non-canon notes on Republic of Svolhas, written as backstory for John Leeker's Alimash character in Wellby one shot

The Republic of Svolhas is an "Athenian-style" democracy based around several important coastal cities, of which Rava is the largest and most important, with a substantial interior hinterland of mostly smallholds and rural villages that are generally ruled (often without direct representation) by a city to which they owe allegiance. Each city is ruled independently by the council of citizens, with a Senate consisting of representatives from each city that meets in Rava and controls foreign policy. Svolhas lives largely on trade: the Svolhas merchants often act as intermediaries between the desert cities (such as Medju) where exotic goods and spices are traded, and the Western Gulf (Sembara, Cymea, and Tollen). 

 About 40 years ago, the Sharktooth Wars ended with the defeat of the previously dominant tribe, the Sharktooth clan, and the expulsion of hobgoblins from the fertile interior of the island, followed by a period of intense fortification to protect the northeastern borders. This has left the remaining hobgoblins -- currently dominated by the Skullcleaver tribe -- to turn to coastal raids and piracy.

The navy of the Republic of Svolhas has grown fast in the past generation, with lots of opportunities for advancement. While originally a largely galley-based fleet designed for coastal defense, in the past 10 years the Svolhasian Navy has made a name for itself on the eastern Green Sea, and there is much debate within Rava and other cities about finishing the job that was partially done 40 years ago, and driving the Skullcleaver clan and its remaining followers off the island for good. 

A few months ago, the citizens council of Rava voted to request that the Senate make diplomatic overtures to others on the Eastern Green Sea, to explore the possibility of a naval alliance, lead by the Svholhasian navy, to finish the hobgoblins once and for all. After much debate, this was approved. Several experienced naval commanders were sent with letters, a mix of diplomatic messages, trade documents to help finance naval expansion, and personal appeals/missives to diplomats across the Eastern Green Sea, traveling on fast ships. 

Alimash was one of these commanders, sent with a bundle of documents and letters to deliver to islands in the southern part of this island chain. Although your character did not know the exact content of these documents, he knew they were important for the success of the naval mission being considered back home. So, when you ship -- the fast merchant vessel Spice Queen, out of Medju, was apparently attacked from belowdecks, by humans who bored a hole into the side of ship, just at waterline, you engaged them in combat immediately. While two tried to keep you occupied, the other four went looking through the hold for crew or passengers to kidnap. Distracted by combat, you didn't even notice when one opened the door to your cabin, rooted through your chest, as the area belowdecks began to flood. So it wasn't until some time later that you realized your precious sealed watertight bundle of letters had been torn open, and the letters themselves were already turning to mush in the sea water threatening to sink the ship. 

Five days later, the Spice Queen limped into port at the kenku town of Wahacha, where you quickly heard rumors of other attacks by raiders in a similar way, and rumors that the raiders came from an underwater base to the east. When the Spice Queen left a few days later, hastily patched, you decided to stay, and seek vengeance and look for the redemption of your reputation, by finding and destroying the base of these raiders.
