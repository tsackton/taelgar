Arryn’s Tower is a lone wizard’s tower standing on a small island among the ~Eastern Islands~ of the [[Eastern Green Sea|Green Sea’s]] far east. A long timber dock provides the only straightforward landing, with a footpath leading up to the tower’s reinforced door. Sailors’ tales describe the place as quiet but not abandoned, and recent signs of traffic suggest a reclusive occupant maintains the site.

Notable for its mirrored guardians and subtle glamour, the tower’s threshold has been warded for generations. Shattered looking‑glasses and polished panes are said to hold defensive magics: when disturbed, swirling shards of glass coalesce into dangerous constructs, and reflective illusions test the resolve of would‑be intruders. Whether these protections were left by Arryn or inherited from a prior master is unclear, but they are closely associated with the tower in mariners’ accounts.

Though little is firmly recorded about Arryn, the tower is rumored to be a waypoint for scholars and hedge‑mages seeking esoteric knowledge of planar crossings, particularly matters bordering the [[Feywild]]. Those who have dealt with the tower’s inhabitant speak of meticulous wardcraft and a strict insistence on courtesies at the door, as if the rites of entry themselves are part of the tower’s magic.

Geographically, the tower lies amid pine‑clad islets, coral shallows, and low dunes characteristic of the Eastern Isles. Currents in this region can be swift and deceptive, and local pilots recommend anchoring off sheltered lee shores at dusk. The island’s dock and path appear maintained, but no permanent settlement is known nearby.

Sources speak of broken mirrors near the entrance and a heavy, master‑worked lock—signs of both deliberate protection and recent disturbance. The tower’s reputation as a place of trial rather than simple hostility has made it a quiet point of interest for scholars, sailors of unusual courage, and certain priestly orders who study crossings between the mortal world and the twilight realms.
