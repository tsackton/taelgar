%%copy notes from OneDrive from Wellby solo%%

Arryn’s Tower stands on a small isle among the [[~Eastern Islands~]] of the far [[Eastern Green Sea|Green Sea]], a neat stone shaft with a lantern‑top and weathered galleries looking over pine and coral shallows. A long timber dock and a well‑kept footpath lead to a reinforced door with sigils of welcome.

Within, the tower serves both as residence and laboratory: a modest library of travelogues and planar treatises; a workroom given to transitive magics; and, at the crown, an observatory whose lenses and mirrored instruments are used for scrying tides of other realms. Those with legitimate scholarly purpose sometimes find passage or advice here on matters of crossings, most notably along ways that border the [[Feywild]].

The surrounding waters are swift and deceptive. Local pilots favor anchoring in the lee at dusk and rowing ashore on a falling tide. No nearby settlement is known, but the dock, path, and lantern prove the place is lived in, and small boats occasionally call with victuals and news when weather allows.

Meta/DM notes and campaign interactions:
- Normal state: Arryn present; wards set to “hospitable but cautious” (courtesy bell; threshold charms; steward reception). Mirror apparatus remains at the crown but is secured.
- Temporary anomaly (autumn DR 1748): Arryn trapped in the [[Mirror Realm]]. During this interval the threshold was defended by mirror‑bound effects (swarms of animated glass; reflective illusions) and the crown chamber held a mercury pool and ritual remains. Resolved in [[Campaigns/Dunmari Frontier Campaign/Session Notes/Session 66 (DuFr)|DuFr 66]] when Arryn was freed; wards subsequently reset and hazards removed.
- Practical: Approach by dock on a falling tide; expect formal entry customs; planar research focus includes transitive paths and Fey‑adjacent crossings.
