### ~EastCoast~

- Small sheltered area to the south, on the coast, blocked from desert by mountains, so probably like the non-desert parts of North Africa
    
- Maybe small, super isolated region that has been doing its own thing for thousands of years
    
- Place for rumors of strange things aka Mayan/Incan/non-human stuff (jungle lizardfolk nation?)

This is the area east of [[~Medju Mountains~]] and [[~Eastern Islands~]]
