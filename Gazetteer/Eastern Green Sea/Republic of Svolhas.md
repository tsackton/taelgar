The Republic of Svolhas is a realm on the southeastern coast of [[Irrla]]. Its fertile lowlands are bordered by the island’s rough interior highlands, and its northeastern frontier is heavily fortified against the hobgoblin pirate clans who hold the eastern point of Irrla.

%%^Date:1748%%
In the DR 1740s, the [[Skullcleaver Clan]] clan has become an increasing threat, turning to coastal raiding, which has driven the Republic of Svolhas, not historically a major naval power, to begin to rapidly build up its maritime forces.

Non-canon, based on backstory for [[Alimash]] for Wellby solo, but may be useful for development. 

- Government “Athenian-style” with multiple coastal cities and a senate meeting in a leading port (named as Rava).
- Trade-focused intermediary between [[Medju]] and the western ports.
- Sharktooth Wars as a proposed name for a conflict that drove hobgoblins out of parts of Irrla’s interior.

Backstory copied below:

The Republic of Svolhas is an "Athenian-style" democracy based around several important coastal cities, of which Rava is the largest and most important, with a substantial interior hinterland of mostly smallholds and rural villages that are generally ruled (often without direct representation) by a city to which they owe allegiance. Each city is ruled independently by the council of citizens, with a Senate consisting of representatives from each city that meets in Rava and controls foreign policy. Svolhas lives largely on trade: the Svolhas merchants often act as intermediaries between the desert cities (such as Medju) where exotic goods and spices are traded, and the Western Gulf (Sembara, Cymea, and Tollen). 

 About 40 years ago, the Sharktooth Wars ended with the defeat of the previously dominant tribe, the Sharktooth clan, and the expulsion of hobgoblins from the fertile interior of the island, followed by a period of intense fortification to protect the northeastern borders. This has left the remaining hobgoblins -- currently dominated by the Skullcleaver tribe -- to turn to coastal raids and piracy.

The navy of the Republic of Svolhas has grown fast in the past generation, with lots of opportunities for advancement. While originally a largely galley-based fleet designed for coastal defense, in the past 10 years the Svolhasian Navy has made a name for itself on the eastern Green Sea, and there is much debate within Rava and other cities about finishing the job that was partially done 40 years ago, and driving the Skullcleaver clan and its remaining followers off the island for good. 

A few months ago, the citizens council of Rava voted to request that the Senate make diplomatic overtures to others on the Eastern Green Sea, to explore the possibility of a naval alliance, lead by the Svholhasian navy, to finish the hobgoblins once and for all. After much debate, this was approved. Several experienced naval commanders were sent with letters, a mix of diplomatic messages, trade documents to help finance naval expansion, and personal appeals/missives to diplomats across the Eastern Green Sea, traveling on fast ships. 

Alimash was one of these commanders, sent with a bundle of documents and letters to deliver to islands in the southern part of this island chain. Although your character did not know the exact content of these documents, he knew they were important for the success of the naval mission being considered back home. So, when you ship -- the fast merchant vessel Spice Queen, out of Medju, was apparently attacked from belowdecks, by humans who bored a hole into the side of ship, just at waterline, you engaged them in combat immediately. While two tried to keep you occupied, the other four went looking through the hold for crew or passengers to kidnap. Distracted by combat, you didn't even notice when one opened the door to your cabin, rooted through your chest, as the area belowdecks began to flood. So it wasn't until some time later that you realized your precious sealed watertight bundle of letters had been torn open, and the letters themselves were already turning to mush in the sea water threatening to sink the ship. 

Five days later, the Spice Queen limped into port at the kenku town of Wahacha, where you quickly heard rumors of other attacks by raiders in a similar way, and rumors that the raiders came from an underwater base to the east. When the Spice Queen left a few days later, hastily patched, you decided to stay, and seek vengeance and look for the redemption of your reputation, by finding and destroying the base of these raiders.
