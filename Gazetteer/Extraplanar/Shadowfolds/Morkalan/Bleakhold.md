A dismal Dwarven village along the [[Muddy River]], in the [[Shadowfolds]] domain of [[Morkalan]]. 

%%^Date:1748-08-26%%
It was described by the dwarves who were rescued from Morkalan as a large village, home to maybe 800 people. However, it usually felt much smaller, as few ever left their homes, except at need, to fetch water or harvest the wild grasses and rice that grew along the [[Muddy River]] and seemed to provide sufficient sustenance for what passed for life in [[Morkalan]]. It was tunneled into the cliffs, although a large number of buildings were also poorly constructed of mud and stone along the river's edge.

Raw DM notes
## Overview

Bleakhold is a dwarven village, home to about 800 people these days. About 2/3 of the buildings are built of stone and mud (poorly, for dwarves) or carved into the cliffs, while the rest is tunneled into several large caverns in the cliff face.

There is no real obvious source of food, although they seem to have enough to eat, or at least enough to survive. The village itself is a pale reflection of life - few sounds disturb the quiet of Morkalan.

## The Watch

Village is watched, and watchers are watched, so new arrivals will be reported.

## Scenes

Upon approaching the village, a few possible scenes.

1. The guards, in a monotonous ritual, pacing back and forth, seeming not to really notice anything, slow to react. At the end of each pace back and forth, pause staring off into the distance for a moment. Once the characters are noticed, one will leave, saying little and ignoring any conversation.
2. Rurik, a dwarf of indeterminant age but at least middle-aged, sobbing quietly, barely audible, trying to keep his despair from the other villagers. His son, Tak has not returned from a his wandering, usually he comes back by nightfall, or in a few days, but it has been nearly a week now. He has little to go on, other than that Tak traveled "upriver", and often likes to try to find the ghost of his mother.

Most of the village, such as it is, is shut tight, few dwarves ever leave their homes. Most houses have either specters, wights, or dust and ash using mephit stats, or people cowering.

The key should be that most cannot remember their past, and over time memories of the outside world fade particularly quickly.

Most dwarves should have forgotten their clan name by now.
