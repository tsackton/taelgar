Morkalan, known as the Land of the Dishonored Dead, is a rumored domain of despair and deathless life. 

%%^Date:1748%%
![[morkalan-ash-plains.png|right|500]]It was described by those who escaped as a bleak, shadowy place, a land where the sky was always dim and the faint sun could not pierce the looming clouds. It was a small place, a land that one could cross in a day or two on foot, although the few who wandered into the bleak clouds around its borders always found themselves wandering back into Morkalan from another direction some time later. 

![[morkalan-muddy-river.png|right|500]]It was a land with few features to distinguish the landscape, except the [[Muddy River]], which is presumed to be a shadowy echo of the [[Hara]]. On the western edge of the Muddy River, a series of cliffs and caves provided some shelter and was the location of the only notable settlement in Morkalan, known as [[Bleakhold]]. 

East of the Muddy River, the land stretched into the Ashfields, a broken, barren land where few survived, home primarily to those who lots their wits or their will, or those who disobeyed the orders of Morkalan and were exiled to become hungry ghosts in the wastes. 
## Inhabitants of Morkalan
Morkalan was inhabited primarily by dwarves who were drawn in by the curse of [[Hagrim]], upon his death and the creation of the domain. Few, however, who survived their years in this place can remember clearly their lives before, though some of the history that the survivors and the dwarves of [[Tharn Todor]] have been able to piece together is [[Chalice of the Runepriest|described elsewhere]]. The defining feature of the domain, according to the [[Riswynn|servants]] of the [[Bahrazel|Bahrâzel]] who finally destroyed it was the profound lack of a divine presence. The souls of the dead, trapped in Morkalan, were not taken up to the [[Land of the Dead]] and beyond, and over time the land became inhabited more by ghosts than any living souls. Even the people who survived seemed strangely mindless, often simply repeating routines over and over for no apparent purpose. While many, but not all, have recovered since being freed, none can clearly remember the passage of time in Morkalan. 

Although the vast majority of the inhabitants of Morkalan were dwarves, a handful of others found themselves pulled into the domain at various points, and established a small camp on the cliffs above the Muddy River. 

## Origin of Morkalan
From what can be reconstructed, it appears that Morkalan was brought into being by the madness of [[Hagrim]], a dwarf warrior and hero of the [[Great War]], when he, in death, betrayed his companions and turned from the gods. But Hagrim could not recall his story or his past life, having simply come to identify himself as Morkalan, the soul of Dishonor. 

## Destruction of Morkalan
In August of 1748, the Chalice of the Runepriest was recovered by the dwarf adventurer Riswynn. Through it, she was drawn to the realm of the [[Bahrazel]], the Heart of the Mountain, and sent (with three companions repaying debts to the [[Bahrazel]]) to Morkalan. [[Session 56 (DuFr)|Hagrim was defeated ]]and the waters of the Chalice of the Runepriest shattered the fabric of the domain, destroying it.

Raw DM notes 

# DM Notes

Morkalan is a small domain; one can walk across it in a day. The sky is always dim and shadowed, the horizon bounded by endless mists.

## Denizens of Morkalan

Most of the denizens of Morkalan are dwarves, some soulless creations of Hagrim, others the same dwarves, or descendants of the dwarves that were lost on the plains of Dunmar 150 years ago.

Possible monsters of Morkalan include:
Various trolls: spirit troll, rot troll, other kinds of modifications to the base troll stat block
Shadow Demon
Will-o'-wisp
Specter
Banshee
Ghost
Gallows Speaker
Shadow
Indentured Spirit
Wraith
Phantom Warrior
Sword Wraith Warrior
Eidolon (any form)

## People of Morkalan

The main groups of people in Morkalan are:

- the dwarves of Bleakhold
- the Chardonians, camped north of the Lost Camps
- three middle-aged Dunmari warriors (cousins) who explored the statue of the Stoneborn on a dare and were trapped, and have been for the past 20 years
- the mad priest, a dwarf refugee from Ardith who survived but has kind of lost their mind trapped in Morkalan for 150 years, lives alone

## Places in Morkalan

### Muddy River

The muddy river runs about 25 miles from one end of Morkalan to the other. The water is flat and bitter tasting, but safe to drink.

Travel is easy along the river, moving at a normal pace.
#### Encounters

Generally the river is pretty quiet, but might encounter:

1. A NPC from [Bleakhold](onenote:#Bleakhold&section-id={83DD85D0-7509-9249-8E9F-5468A0CDB2BE}&page-id={FE8516F9-6242-B848-8BC1-FFF52015908C}&end&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/402ba7d9f74aa3e7/Documents/Taelgar/02_Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Adventures/Solo%20Arcs%20\(interlude\).one) on a journey of some kind
2. Will-o'-wisps or some other kind of mindless undead that will attempt to lure travelers to their doom
3. Lost ghosts
4. Wandering memory-spirits (specter, wraith, or similar stat block)

### The Ashfields

To the east of the river, the land is flat and desolate, just ash and dust as far as the eye can see, with the occasional small rocky hill.

This area is dominated by trolls and ghosts. Those who disobey the commands of Hagrim are exiled to the Ashfields, and nearly all die, killed by the undying remnants of the trolls who fought in the fire giant's army. They are under the control of Hagrim, and never venture across the river.
#### Encounters

The most common encounter is trolls of various kinds. Generally in packs of 2 or 3.

Faded ghosts, clinging to what little is left of them, can also be found here.

[Delg Firebrand](onenote:#Delg%20Firebrand&section-id={83DD85D0-7509-9249-8E9F-5468A0CDB2BE}&page-id={C25A92CD-F487-964C-B7BB-329E2DAE8A85}&end&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/402ba7d9f74aa3e7/Documents/Taelgar/02_Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Adventures/Solo%20Arcs%20\(interlude\).one), Hagrim's younger cousin, now known as the Mad Priest, lives in a cave here. Hagrim, despite everything, would not let the trolls kill a blood relative, although now he has forgotten why he let Delg live, and even that he ordered the trolls to leave him alone. So Delg persists, in his cave, driven mad by the despair of this place.

### Cliffs

The lost camps of the Dunmari, as well as the hideout of the Chardonians, are on the cliffs.

This is a twisted, rocky desert.

#### Encounters

Little should be encountered on the cliffs, until they come to the camps and are attacked by Dunmari ghosts.

### Lost Camps

Perched on the cliffs above the muddy river is a small Dunmari camp. There are 8 people living here. Five are listless and speak only in monosyllabic replies when spoken to, and seem to be utterly uncurious about anyone.

They are the remnants of a Dunmari company that took refuge near the Stoneborn statue during the wars against the Blackened Claw hobgoblin tribe, and were drawn through the mists. They are all old, and look faded, somehow, more ghost than human. 

Three arrived more recently, maybe 20 years ago. They are middle-aged now, and can speak a bit about the place. They know that no one dies of old age here, they just fade, until they are more ghost than human. And that even those who die in battle cannot leave, their spirits linger.

Hagrim toys with the Dunmari, occasionally ordering dwarves to go tell them they have found a way past the mists. This has happened enough, at this point, that the Dunmari are deeply suspicious of dwarves, and the Dunmari ghosts will likely attack intruders.

Only [Kaylan](onenote:#Kaylan&section-id={83DD85D0-7509-9249-8E9F-5468A0CDB2BE}&page-id={5E72A636-FEAD-9840-87DF-95D746D1B5F9}&end&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/402ba7d9f74aa3e7/Documents/Taelgar/02_Campaigns/Dunmari%20Frontier/Adventures/Solo%20Arcs%20\(interlude\).one), the youngest of the cousins, still has enough hope to want to listen, and he will emerge 2 rounds after combat starts and scatter the ghosts and invite them into camp.

#### Battle

A wraith, two phantom warriors with spears and bows instead of longsword, and two specters will defend the camp, until Kaylan calls them off at initiative count 10 on the 3rd round of combat.
