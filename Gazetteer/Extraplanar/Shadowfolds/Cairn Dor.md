Cairn Dor is the name of a shadowed realm, connected to the [[Material Plane]] via the [[Cleaver-Stone]] portal, and associated with the sleepless army of the [[Shemra Azem]]. Folk traditions link it to [[Yeshara]] and a network of soul-plinths used to draw dreamers from the [[Material Plane]].

%%^Campaign:GL%%
In the DR 1730s and DR 1740s, scattered [[Lizardfolk]] villages turned up mysteriously emptied of people. The [[Silver Tempests]] discovered that this was linked to the story of [[Cairn Dor]], [[Yeshara]], and the [[Cleaver-Stone]].

All developed detail is in [[GL - Session 62 - DM Notes|GL - Session 62 - DM Notes]] and backlinks.

Connected to mysterious lizardfolk disapperances, e.g. [[Samso]]'s backstory.
