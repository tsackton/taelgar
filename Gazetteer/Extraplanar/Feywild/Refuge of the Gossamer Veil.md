The Refuge of the Gossamer Veil was a small pocket of Amberglow that was defended by, among others, [[Greymalkin]] and [[Aelirios Sunblade]] until it was captured by [[Lord Umbraeth]] and integrated into [[Duskmire]].

Greymalkin survived a prisoner (but with his wings stripped from him), and Aelirios died.

The date of this event is not determined but the details in [[Greymalkin's Story]] should be considered canonical, subject to the fact that Greymalkin suffered a lot of trauma and could be a (slightly) unreliable narrator.

The relationship between the Gossamer Veil and Cloudspinner, other than "loyalists", is not clear and it is intended to not really matter. The only future plans for the Refuge specifically is an eventual quest to find Greymalkin's wings, where having some clues and an adventure in Duskmire or Amberglow is plausible. But this adventure is not written and is targeted for 10th level or so, and can easily accomodate future worldbuilding around fey politics
