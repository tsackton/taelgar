Whispervale is a land of mists and clouds hiding rocky mountain valleys, craggy peaks, and rushing waterfalls. This is a land of illusions and mystery, where little is as it seems. 

%% A misty land of hidden valleys and illusion, where voices echo strangely and no two paths lead to the same place twice. The realm's rulers never speak, yet their whispers are heard in every travelerâ€™s mind. %%
