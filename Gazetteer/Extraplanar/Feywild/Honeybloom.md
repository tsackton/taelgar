A fey realm, described in [[The Lore of the Feywild]] as a realm of rolling orchards, golden meadows, and drowsy glades, where the scent of ripe fruit lingers in the air, lulling visitors into languid contentmentâ€”but those who linger too long often forget why they came, or how to leave.

Honeybloom is located northwest of [[Fortune's Rest]], and northeast of [[Gleamwater]].
