%% status/incomplete ->  significant in multiple games (Addermarch, and especially Cleenseau) and page is currently very under-detailed for importance %%

The realm of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. A land of perpetual twilight, but full of sparkling lights and stars (but no moon), music, and feasting. This is a place of fine things - dainty food, elegant clothes, refined music, complex dances.  The outer halls are less refined, but their is a touch of elegance and grace everywhere. This is not a place where fortune's are won and lost or where anything goes.

Potential imagery: the horizon glows with faint reflected sunlight, as of an hour after sunset, and the stars above are twinkling and starting to appear,  with the sky above much darker and full of a spray of milkly way type stars

Real world images: Michelin-starred restaurant or British upper class ball, but with true grace, minimal pretension
