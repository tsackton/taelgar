Emberwine is a fey realm, south of [[Amberglow]], west of the [[Sunset Gate]], and east of [[Everlight's Bloom]]. It is a realm of revelry and dance, a place where music and wine flow freely. It is a land of rolling vineyards and gentle hills, bathed in the constant golden light of the late afternoon sun.
