The Refuge of the Gossamer Veil was a hidden redoubt in [[Amberglow]], remembered in stories as one of the last pockets of safety after the realm began to fade after [[Cloudspinner]]'s disappearance. 

%%^Campaign:clee%%
The Refuge of the Gossamer Veil was home to [[Greymalkin]], who [[Greymalkin's Story|recounted]] being born in there in the years before the [[Great War]], and serving beside [[Aelirios Sunblade]] in its defense. In time, though, [[Lord Umbraeth]] coveted the Refuge and attacked; Aelirios fell, and the Gossamer Veil was lost. Greymalkin survived only to have his wings shorn, and to carry the memory of the Refuge’s fall into later years.

Dates of founding and destruction in metadata are not based on any canonical information  and could be changed. 

Details in [[Greymalkin's Story]] should be considered canonical, subject to the fact that Greymalkin suffered a lot of trauma and could be a (slightly) unreliable narrator.

The relationship between the Gossamer Veil and Cloudspinner, other than "loyalists", is not clear and it is intended to not really matter. The only future plans for the Refuge specifically is an eventual quest to find Greymalkin's wings, where having some clues and an adventure in Duskmire or Amberglow is plausible. But this adventure is not written and is targeted for 10th level or so, and can easily accomodate future worldbuilding around fey politics

Note the refuge is presumably part of the larger set of strongholds established by Cloudspinner's allies in the years after her disappearance, including [[Redsun Watch]] and [[Night's Edge Keep]]. 

Aeririos presumably possessed an [[Amberlight]], which may have been connected to the creation of the [[Lantern of the Bright Hearth]]
