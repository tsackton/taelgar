Redsun Watch is one of several outposts established by the [[Cloudspinner]] on the eastern edge of [[Amberglow]], near the [[Sunset Gate]]. Since her disappearance, the fate of Redsun Watch and other border outposts is unknown.

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
According to [[Lirien|Lirien]], who was the Lanternkeeper of Redsun Watch, some time after the [[Cloudspinner]]'s disappearance "rivers of shadow" invaded across the [[Sunset Gate]], from [[Hollowdark]] and [[Darkfall]], and Redsun Keep was destroyed.
