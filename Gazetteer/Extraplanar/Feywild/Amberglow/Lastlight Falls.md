# The Lastlight Falls

Lastlight Falls is a portal between the Feywild and the material plane, located in the [[Nashtkar]], northwest of [[Kharsan]] and south of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] in the material plane, and in [[Amberglow]] in the [[Feywild]]. It takes the form of a waterfall with no visible source, that seems to glow with increasing intensity as the sunset approaches.

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
It is possible to step through the mists of the waterfall and walk between planes, but only for a short time each day, as the portal is only open around the time of sunset in the [[Material Plane]].
