A dense grove of trees somewhere in Amberglow, a place of old magic associated with transformation and growth. 

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
Many years ago, [[Agata|Agata Dustmother]] stole secrets from the Heartwood Grove, using this knowledge to create living wood, that she used to transform her victims into furniture, dolls, and puppets. After she was defeated by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] for the second time, she was imprisoned here, under guard of [[Caulaus]], to await the [[Cloudspinner]]'s return and her doom.
