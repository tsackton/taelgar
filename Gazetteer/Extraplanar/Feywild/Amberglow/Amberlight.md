Amberlights are intricate crystal lanterns infused with the light of the sunset of [[Amberglow]], created by the [[Cloudspinner]] to gift some of her power to her closest allies. 

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
[[Lirien]] possessed an Amberlight, which she rescued from the fall of [[Redsun Watch]]. It ceased to cast light not long after she fled [[Redsun Watch]], and only started to flicker back to light again after the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] rescued [[Cloudspinner]] from the [[~Circular Island~]].
