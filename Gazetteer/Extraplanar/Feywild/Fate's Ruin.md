A fey realm west of [[Fortune's Rest]], described in [[The Lore of the Feywild]] as a place steeped in decay, a land where all things, no matter how great, crumble to dust in time. Travelers whisper of a mysterious Baron, whose mere touch hastens the inevitable withering of all to dust, yet none dare to speak his name aloud, lest they draw his gaze.
