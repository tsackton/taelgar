Rostaurë, the Forest of Rains, was an elven realm, lying roughly a hundred and fifty miles northeast of [[Drankor]] between the river valleys and the bay. In its elder days it was a living forest‑city, famed for towering rain‑soaked trees and for Estemar, “the City of Peace,” where [[Elves]], [[Humans]], and peronar once lived together. For much of the history of the [[Drankorian Empire]], Rostaurë was a close ally. Elven advisors served at the imperial court, and Rostaurë’s warriors rode beside Drankorian armies in the old wars against extraplanar incursions. 

The realm’s fortunes turned after the [[Drankorian Civil War]] and the rise of the [[Omnis Pura]]. As civil war and persecution spread from Drankor, Rostaurë became a refuge for peronar and other dissidents, protected by the forest’s ancient magics and the grace of [[Aldanor]]. That protection failed when [[Apollyon]] seized the [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]], which shut out the gods. With the cloak, Apollyon marched through Rostaurë, sacked Estemar, and burned the elder trees, destroying the realm in the last years of his reign.

In the centuries since, Rostaurë has been remembered chiefly through the testimony of survivors such as [[Arheste]] and through scattered elven and Drankorian chronicles. Those who survived mostly fled upriver to [[Orenlas]], carrying the memory of the Forest of Rains with them.
