Rostaurë, the Forest of Rains, was an elven realm in the Central Lowlands, lying roughly a hundred and fifty miles northeast of [[Drankor]] between the river valleys and the bay. In its elder days it was a living forest‑city, famed for towering rain‑soaked trees and for Estemar, “the City of Peace,” where [[Elves]], [[Humans]], and peronar once lived together.

During the Founding Period of the [[Drankorian Empire]], Rostaurë was closely allied with Drankor. Elven advisors served at the imperial court, and Rostaurë’s warriors rode beside Drankorian armies in the old wars against giants, elementals, and the spreading fire.

The realm’s fortunes turned during the Dominion Wars and the rise of the [[Omnis Pura]]. As civil war and persecution spread from Drankor, Rostaurë became a refuge for peronar and other dissidents, protected by the forest’s ancient magics and the grace of [[Aldanor]]. That protection failed when [[Apollyon]] seized the [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]], which shut out the gods. With the cloak, Apollyon marched through Rostaurë, sacked Estemar, and burned the elder trees, destroying the realm in the last years of his reign.

In the centuries since, Rostaurë has been remembered chiefly through the testimony of survivors such as [[Arheste]] and through scattered elven and Drankorian chronicles. Those who escaped the sack later gathered far upriver in [[Orenlas]], carrying the memory of the Forest of Rains with them.

Arheste’s account places the sack around DR 1048, while this note’s frontmatter lists destruction in DR 1051; review for consistency. %%
