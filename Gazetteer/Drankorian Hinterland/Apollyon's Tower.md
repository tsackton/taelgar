# Apollyon's Tower

Apollyon's Tower is a black marble spire on the coast of the [[~Circular Island~]], once a stronghold and retreat of the Drankorian emperor [[Apollyon]]. In the height of the [[Drankorian Empire]], it served as an imperial seat far from [[Drankor]], and in Apollyon’s later years it became a place of dark study and craft.

After the [[Fall of Drankor]] the tower stood abandoned and warded, looming over the island’s storm‑lashed shore. In DR 1749 the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] assaulted the ruin, uncovering its forge, libraries, and throne room, and carrying away the treasures now catalogued as [[Apollyon's Tower Treasure]].
