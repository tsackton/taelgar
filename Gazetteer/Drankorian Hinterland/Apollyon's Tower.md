Apollyon's Tower is a black marble spire on the coast of the [[Circular Island]], once a stronghold and retreat of the Drankorian emperor [[Apollyon]], a place of dark study and craft. The tower itself is almost 250 feet tall, with a main section that rises 140 feet from the ground, and battlements and a tower extension that rise another 100 feet, capped with a platform open to the sky. After the [[Fall of Drankor]], the tower stood abandoned and warded, looming over the island’s storm‑lashed shore.

In DR 1749 the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] assaulted the ruin, uncovering its forge, libraries, and throne room, and carrying away the treasures now catalogued as [[Apollyon's Tower Treasure]].
