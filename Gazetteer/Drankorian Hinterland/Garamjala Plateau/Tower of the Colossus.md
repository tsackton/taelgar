# The Tower of the Colossus

The Tower of the Colossus is a half‑buried white marble tower rising from the sands of the [[Garamjala Plateau]]. Its upper chambers stand open to wind and sun, while deeper levels have long been choked with drifting sand. Dunmari desert tales spoke of a “white tower with shaking walls,” hinting at the pounding heard beneath its ruined floors.

In DR 1749 the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] entered the tower, confronted a colossal ancient construct trapped within, and destroyed it. Beneath the sand they discovered sealed chambers and a hidden archive, carrying away the [[Tower of the Colossus Treasure]].
