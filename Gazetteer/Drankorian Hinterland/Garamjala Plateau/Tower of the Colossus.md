The Tower of the Colossus is a half‑buried white marble tower rising from the sands of the [[Garamjala Plateau]]. Its upper levels are open to wind and sun, while the lower levels have long been choked with drifting sand. 

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
In DR 1749 the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] entered the tower, confronted a colossal ancient construct trapped within, and destroyed it. Beneath the sand they discovered sealed chambers and a hidden archive, carrying away the [[Tower of the Colossus Treasure]].
