The Temple of the Eight Divines is the greatest surviving holy site in the ruins of [[Drankor]], dedicated to the [[Mos Numena Pantheon|Eight Divines]]. Though the city around it is choked by jungle and shadow, the temple’s interior remains miraculously preserved: a vast central chamber beneath a mirrored dome, warmed by divine radiance, with a marble‑and‑gold altar at its heart. Eight chapels radiate outward, each dedicated to one of the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]]. 

Beneath the sanctuary lies an immense undercrypt that mirrors the temple above. Statues and niches line the halls, bearing the metal death masks of Drankorian funerary tradition. The crypt’s holy wards endured long after the empire’s fall, making the temple a rare refuge amid the haunted city.

In DR 1749 the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] sheltered here during their campaign against [[Apollyon]], and explored the crypts below while seeking relics tied to his victims.

Slightly unclear how much of the haunted nature of Drankor (mentioned in second sentence) is plague echos, and how much is Apollyon, so it is possible that Drankor is somewhat less haunted now. But not not-haunted. 

Served as Rai's sanctuary for many years; featured in [[Kenzo's Dream of Monks]] as the location where the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]] first encountered [[Rai]]. 

Before Rai left to help the monks of the Awakened Soul attempt to cleanse Isingue Limbo corruption (ending in the [[Awakened Soul Disaster]]), he hid [[Apollyon's Phylactery]] in a magically concealed chest in the grand vault beneath the altar, protected by many wards.
