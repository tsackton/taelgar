### DM Notes

**Vibe**:
- A dynamic institution blending magical innovation with practical applications, such as engineering and military support.
- Known for applied magic, breakthroughs in enchantments, and experimental weaponry, it was indispensable to Drankor’s infrastructure and war efforts, especially against planar incursions. 

**Ruins Description**:
- Tall, shadowy towers remain eerily intact, faintly glowing with residual magic.
- Angular stone buildings overrun with vines, their interiors littered with shattered devices and charred magic circles. 
- Laboratories and forges, partially preserved by magical auras, contain broken artifacts and scorch marks from volatile enchantments.
