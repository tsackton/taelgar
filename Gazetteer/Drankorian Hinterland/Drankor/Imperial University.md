# Imperial University

The Imperial University was one of the three great universities of [[Drankor]] in the late Drankorian Empire, alongside [[Valtrius University]] and the [[University of the Blessed Waters]] (the Thalorian). Surviving trade and administrative scrolls name it as a major center of learning, but little else is preserved in current sources.
