Apollyon's Temple is a vast structure in [[Drankor]], raised during Apollyon’s reign, as monument and focus for his quest to become a god. The main hall is carved with iconography of worshippers in reverence, with a central altar and side chapels that once displayed the regalia and relics of his cult. After Apollyon’s fall the temple became a prison to contain him, magically sealed in the jungle‑covered city.

In DR 1749 the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] forced entry into the undercrypt, pursued Apollyon into his inner sanctum, and defeated him there.
