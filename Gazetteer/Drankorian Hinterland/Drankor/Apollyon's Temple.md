# Apollyon's Temple

Apollyon's Temple is a vast monument in [[Drankor]], raised during Apollyon’s reign as emperor and god‑king. The main hall is carved with iconography of worshippers in reverence, with a central altar and side chapels that once displayed the regalia and relics of his cult.

After Apollyon’s fall the temple became a silent ruin, its lower vaults sealed beneath the jungle‑covered city. In DR 1749 the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] forced entry into the undercrypt, pursued Apollyon into his inner sanctum, and defeated him there.

## DM notes

- A hidden staircase beneath a loose tile near the central altar led to unfinished construction tunnels and trapped chambers below the temple, where Apollyon maintained his lair.
