# University of the Blessed Waters

The University of the Blessed Waters, also called the Thalorian, was one of the three great universities of [[Drankor]] in the last centuries of the Drankorian Empire. It stood southeast of the [[Temple of the Eight Divines]], amid gardens and lecture halls that once housed a Faculty of Natural History and other schools.

In the present ruins, the university is overgrown and unstable. Its approach leads through jungle‑choked streets to a walled garden marked by two guardian statues, still animated by lingering magic.

## DM notes

- Scrolls recovered from the Custom House in DR 1749 named Minarith as a faculty member here, and the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] later searched his former office while gathering mementos for [[Apollyon's Phylactery]]’s destruction.
