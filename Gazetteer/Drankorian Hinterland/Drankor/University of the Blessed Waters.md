The University of the Blessed Waters, also called the Thalorian, was one of the three great universities of [[Drankor]] in the last centuries of the Drankorian Empire. It stood southeast of the [[Temple of the Eight Divines]], amid gardens and lecture halls that once housed a Faculty of Natural History and other schools.

In the present ruins, the university is overgrown and unstable. Its approach leads through jungle‑choked streets to a walled garden marked by two guardian statues, still animated by lingering magic.

- Known as the University of the Blessed Waters, with its elvish roots reflected in its serene, naturalistic design.
- Open courtyards, lush gardens, and elegant stone buildings seamlessly integrated with nature, emphasizing harmony with the world.
- Associated with natural philosophy, astronomy, arts, and literature; its most renowned college, Thalorian, was dedicated to understanding the natural world and the cosmos.
- Water features, such as reflecting pools and flowing channels, crisscross the campus, lending an ethereal tranquility.
