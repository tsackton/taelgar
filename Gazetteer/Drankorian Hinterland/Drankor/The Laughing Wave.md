# The Laughing Wave

The Laughing Wave was a halfling tavern on the docks of [[Drankor]], known for boisterous gatherings and bright rooftop fireworks. Before the city’s fall it was owned by [[Seraphina Appleblossom]], a beloved tavern‑keeper of the harbor quarter.

In the ruins of Drankor the tavern lies collapsed and overgrown. Its arched entrance—carved with curling waves—still marks the site, and a cool stone cellar remains largely intact beneath the debris. 

%%^Campaign:none%%

A foundation of a sturdy stone tavern, with walls still standing to 10-15 feet, although no roof and the upper floors collapsed into rubble that chokes the interior. The door is rotted away, but a stone engraving set in the arch above the door is still visible, of stylized waves curling into a crescent. A search can also uncovered partially buried paving stones/tiles showing several tankards of ale with fireworks bursting from them.

The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] searched the ruin in DR 1749 while seeking mementos of [[Seraphina Appleblossom]]and [[Khemut of Targu]]. They fought bound spirits in the main hall and recovered a scorched cooking pot, firework casings, and a chest of mixed Drankorian and foreign coins from the preserved cellar.

The foundation of the inn remains, though the upper floors have collapsed into rubble. Jungle vines coil through the remains, and faint scorch marks on the stone hint at the raid that ended its story.

1. **Punch Bowl Shards**: Pieces of the painted bowl lie scattered in the rubble, preserved unnaturally as though untouched by time, faintly glowing when approached with the soul-sensing magic.
2. **Roof Tiles**: Several roof tiles are carved with halfling blessings, a reminder of the warmth the inn once held.
3. **Hidden Cellar Door**: A trapdoor buried beneath debris leads to a hidden wine cellar where remnants of firework casings and old lantern frames remain, preserved by the constant cool of the stone. Casks of ale have rotted away to nothing, but perhaps stained the floor. There is also the remains of a chest down here, rotted away to almost nothing, but locked and rusted shut (so very difficult to open unless you just kick it a few times as the wood is no longer substantial). Inside are about 1000 silver coins and 80 gold coins, 

Can also find scattered Drankorian coins on the floor above, as well as a Tankard of Sobriety. 

**Sorrowful Haunts**: 20 Haunt of Doom (CR 16), 1 Haunt (CR 9), 2 Gallows Speaker (CR 12) are lingering in the inn ruins.
