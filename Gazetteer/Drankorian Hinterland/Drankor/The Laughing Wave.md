# The Laughing Wave

The Laughing Wave was a halfling tavern on the docks of [[Drankor]], known for boisterous gatherings and bright rooftop fireworks. Before the city’s fall it was owned by [[Seraphina Appleblossom]], a beloved tavern‑keeper of the harbor quarter.

In the ruins of Drankor the tavern lies collapsed and overgrown. Its arched entrance—carved with curling waves—still marks the site, and a cool stone cellar remains largely intact beneath the debris. Those who wander the docks speak of lingering mist and restless spirits within.

## DM notes

- The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] searched the ruin in DR 1749 while seeking mementos of Seraphina Appleblossom and [[Khemut of Targu]]. They fought bound spirits in the main hall and recovered a scorched cooking pot, firework casings, and a chest of mixed Drankorian and foreign coins from the preserved cellar.
