## 5. Dunmari Basin

*Area:* This region includes the [[Dunmari Basin]], the [[Myraeni Gap]], and the [[Garamjala Desert]] (including the orc kingdom of [[Xurkhaz]]), as well as the ancient city of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and the [[Sea of Storms]]. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The current day climate and geography of this entire region, and the history dated back to before the Downfall, is extensively developed, although much of the history before the Great War is developed only in broad strokes. The history, religion, and politics of Dunmar and Xurkhaz are extensively developed. The desolation around Drankor (including the ruined city itself), the wastes of the Garamjala, and the [[Awakened Jungle]] have significant, but not exhaustive, development. Any future development in this region needs to be aware of significant constraints imposed by existing development. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Much of the history of the Drankorian Empire is only broadly sketched, especially in the core of the Empire represented by this region. The pre-Downfall history of [[Alcarinque]] is only very lightly developed. The [[Nayan Floodplains]] have much less development than the rest of [[Dunmar]], especially about current-day political and cultural details. The [[Yuvanti Mountains]], although canonically the home of the [[Nardith]], has very little detailed development. The region around the [[Shrev]] and south is only lightly sketched, as is the [[Myraeni Gap]]. 

*Blank Regions:* The desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries, but need to be developed with canonical details in mind. The exact impact of the Downfall Wars on [[Alcarinque]], and the fall of the elven empires, is explicitly left blank, to be explored in a potential future Downfall Wars campaign. The [[Nayan Floodplains]] and the [[Yuvanti Mountains]]/[[Nardith]] could use more detailed development, and the area south of the [[Shrev]] as well as the [[Myraeni Gap]] are both potentially open for development, contingent on some details of [[Dunmar#History|Dunmari history]].

*Adventures:* The Dunmar Frontier campaign has involved numerous adventures in this region, including [[Central Dunmar]], [[Darba]] and the [[Darba Highlands]], [[Eastern Dunmar]], [[Tokra]], [[Karawa]], the [[Nashtkar]] and other regions east of Karawa, including [[Kharsan]], [[Xurkhaz]], the [[Awakened Jungle]], and [[Drankor]]. The [[Oskar and Riswynn Adventures]] were largely set in [[Nardith]] and nearby regions, but did not involve much worldbuilding. 
## 6. Eastern Drankor

*Area:* This region includes the area east of the [[Istaros]], west of the [[~Eastern Mountains~]], and south of [[~South Cymea~]]. Most of this region is poorly defined and outside the [[Istaros]] itself, features are largely unnamd. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* This region is almost entirely undeveloped. Canonically, it was part of the heartland of Drankor, and the historical elven realm of [[Rostaure]] was in this region. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* The fate of this region since the fall of Drankor is undetermined, although it is assumed that at least the western parts of this region, closest to Drankor, are dangerous wilderness. The [[~Eastern Mountains~]] are tentatively the eastern border of the [[Drankorian Empire]], but this is not strictly canonical. 

*Blank Regions:* The entire region is essentially blank in the modern day, and most of the historical details of this region are not developed.

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region.
