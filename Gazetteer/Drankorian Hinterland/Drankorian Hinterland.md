## DM Notes and Meta
_See also: [[Places in the Drankorian Hinterland]]

*Area and Border Notes*: The eastern border of this region is not particularly canonical, but is broadly assumed to coincide with the eastern border of the Drankorian Empire. The northern border is similarly unclear, but is broadly meant to be the dividing line between "established civilization" and "dangerous wilderness". This does not preclude civilization lurking somewhere in this region, but in general any future invention with close ties to [[~South Cymea~]] or [[Cymea]] should be in the Western Green Sea region, even if it means moving the border.

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* This region was the core of the Drankorian Empire, which has a canonical history in broad strokes with patches of more extensive development. The basic geography and climate is mostly well-developed. The ruins of the city of [[Drankor]], the [[Circular Island]], and some details of the historical elven realm of [[Rostaure|Rostaurë]] are developed in some detail, as are [[Awakened Jungle|parts]] of the jungle along the coast of the [[Sea of Storms]]. The history of this region after the [[Fall of Drankor]], the wastes of the [[Garamjala Plateau]], and the jungles south of the [[Shrev]] are less developed.

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* Although it is assumed that at least the parts of this region closest to Drankor are dangerous wilderness after the [[Fall of Drankor]], the exact fate of this region in the years between the [[Fall of Drankor]] and the [[Great War]] is an area of active brainstorming but little canon. The [[~Eastern Mountains~]] are tentatively the eastern border of the [[Drankorian Empire]], but this is not strictly canonical. The region immediately south of the [[Shrev]] has some potential brainstorming context around Dunmari history, but nothing has been introduced in game beyond the bare existence of battles across the Shrev with zombies and other strange creatures. 

*Needs Development:* Much of the history of the Drankorian Empire is only loosely sketched: see [[Drankorian Empire - Open Questions]] for potential development needs. The climate and topography of the eastern part of this region (between the [[Istaros]] and the [[~Eastern Mountains~]] is largely blank, although generally assumed to be arid in the current day. The topography of the eastern part of this region may be better left blank until needed to be developed for [[~South Cymea~]] development.

*Intentionally Blank:* The desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries (e.g., the [[Tower of the Colossus]], and are best left as a blank area until needed for a game. The exact impact of the [[Downfall Wars]] on [[Alcarinque]], and the fall of the elven empires, is explicitly left blank, to be explored in a potential future [[Downfall Wars]] campaign. 

*Adventures:* The Dunmar Frontier campaign traveled across the [[Garamjala Plateau]], to the [[Awakened Jungle]], the [[Circular Island]], and [[Drankor]], during the end of the Apollyon arc. 

*Important Places in Staging:* The [[Circular Island]] needs to either be named "The Circular Island" in-game, or be renamed. The [[~Eastern Mountains~]] could use a name, as could the [[~Great Bay~]].
