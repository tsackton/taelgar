*Canonical Development and Constraints:* This region was the core of the Drankorian Empire, which has a canonical history in broad strokes with patches of more extensive development. The basic geography and climate is mostly well-developed. The ruins of the city of [[Drankor]], the [[~Circular Island~]], and some details of the historical elven realm of [[Rostaure|RostaurÃ«]] are developed in some detail, as are [[Awakened Jungle|parts]] of the jungle along the coast of the [[Sea of Storms]]. The history of this region after the [[Fall of Drankor]], the wastes of the [[Garamjala Plateau]], and the jungles south of the [[Shrev]] are less developed.

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* Although it is assumed that at least the parts of this region closest to Drankor are dangerous wilderness after the [[Fall of Drankor]], the exact fate of this region in the years between the [[Fall of Drankor]] and the [[Great War]] is an area of active brainstorming but little canon. The [[~Eastern Mountains~]] are tentatively the eastern border of the [[Drankorian Empire]], but this is not strictly canonical. The region immediately south of the [[Shrev]] has some potential brainstorming context around Dunmari history, but nothing has been introduced in game beyond the bare existence of battles across the Shrev with zombies and other strange creatures. 

*Needs Development:* Much of the history of the Drankorian Empire is only loosely sketched: see [[Drankorian Empire - Open Questions]] for potential development needs. The climate and topography of the eastern part of this region (between the [[Istaros]] and the [[~Eastern Mountains~]] is largely blank, although generally assumed to be arid in the current day. 

*Intentionally Blank:* The desolation around Drankor and the wastes of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] may hold many mysteries (e.g., the [[Tower of the Colossus]], and are best left as a blank area until needed for a game. The exact impact of the Downfall Wars on [[Alcarinque]], and the fall of the elven empires, is explicitly left blank, to be explored in a potential future Downfall Wars campaign. 

*Adventures:* The Dunmar Frontier campaign traveled across the [[Garamjala Plateau]], to the [[Awakened Jungle]], the [[~Circular Island~]], and [[Drankor]], during the end of the Apollyon arc. 

*Important Places in Staging:* The [[~Circular Island~]] needs to either be named "The Circular Island" in-game, or be renamed. The [[~Eastern Mountains~]] could use a name, as could the [[~Great Bay~]].
