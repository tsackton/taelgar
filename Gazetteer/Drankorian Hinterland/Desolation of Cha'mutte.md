# The Desolation of Cha'mutte

The Desolation of Cha'mutte is a large area that is magically corrupted as a result of the [[First Plague]] and the [[Great War]]. 

The Desolation of Cha'mutte includes:
- The area around the ruined city of [[Drankor]] itself, destroyed during the chaos of the [[First Plague]], and now deeply cursed and unexplored.  %%needs a name?%%
- The [[Garamjala Desert]], on a high, arid plateau spanning the [[Kharja]] and [[Istaros]] river valleys, and including the orc realm of [[Xurkhaz]].
- The [[Nashtkar]], the blasted plains, north of the [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]] and east of [[Dunmar]], a land of rocky canyons, twisted hills, and little water, on the western edge of the [[Plaguelands]]
- The [[Plaguelands]], in the [[Istaros Watershed]], centered on the ruined city of [[Isingue]].

While little of the desolation is readily habitable, the areas around the ruined cities of Drankor and Isingue are widely perceived as the most dangerous and cursed. The [[Garamjala Desert|Garamjala]], which runs broadly west to east, well north of Drankor and well south of Isingue, is dry and hot but significantly less magically dangerous, and is home to a few brave or foolhardy souls.  

%% notes
Extend of the desolation to the east is undecided. Garamjala probably doesn't connect to the eastern desert, and probably peters out around the ancient border of Drankor. Drankorian curse area doesn't extend past the bay of Drankor to the east. Southern edge of Garamjala is probably somewhere around or just north of the confluence of the Mahar and Kharja. 

Generally Isingue and Drankor are the "centers of weirdness" and the Garamjala is mostly just dry. 

Nashtkar is close to Plaguelands and really is kind of the western edge of the Plaguelands and the northern edge of the Garamajala. Plaguelands is north of Xurkhaz, which is the northern edge of the Garamjala. Drankorian desolation is south of Garamjala. 

Prior to the Great War, the Plaguelands/Nashtkar/Garamjala didn't exist, and the Desolation of Cha'mutte was just the area around Drankor. The cataclysm that raised the Yuvanti Mountains also created the Garamajala, but this is largely due to weather patterns not magic. The Plaguelands itself, and the Nashtkar, is a result of the destruction of Isingue and whatever magic was there.
