The Circular Island is a strange island in the [[Drankorian Hinterland]], named for its unnaturally regular shape. In modern accounts it is best known for dangerous ruins along its shores and for [[Apollyon's Tower]]—a black spire that still stands warded, “looming over the island’s storm‑lashed shore.”
