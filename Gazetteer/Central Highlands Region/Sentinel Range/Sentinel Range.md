# The Sentinel Range
>[!info]+ Summary
> a mountain chain in [[Central Highlands Region]], [[Taelgar]]

The Sentinel Range, also called the Sentinel Mountains or the Sentinels, are the extensive mountain range that separates the [[Green Sea]] and the surrounding lands from the [[West Coast Region|west coast]] of Taelgar.

In the south, in northern [[Dunmar]], the mountains are steep and rocky, with only a handful of passes. In the winter, they are snow-covered, but there is little permanent ice and few or no glaciers. 

Further north, the mountains are somewhat less rugged, but high enough in places to be permanently snow-covered. 

Major settlements of [[Dwarves]] and [[Stoneborn]] call the Sentinels their home, and historically this area was, and is, the center of Dwarven civilization. 

The Sentinels have many names: they are called the Indalas by the [[Stoneborn]], Labkhan by the [[dwarves]], Beredri by the [[Deno'qai]], and Tushara by the Dunmari. 


%% OLD NAME NOTES
Brainstorming name ideas

I like Labkhan or Labkar in dwarvish and the Sentinels/Citadel Range/ some variant for English - Mike

Many large/prominent mountain chains in real world have some derivation around "White" or "Snowy"(e.g. alps, Himalayas). 

If we take a Deno'qai perspective, this could be something like:
Lavan (white in hebrew), or variants like Lavnal / Lavnel / Laviel / Lavni 
Beredo (snow in amharic) or variants like Beredri / Beledri / Berad 

Already decided they were called the Indala Mountains, or Indalas, by the Stonborn. Theoretically this could just be the universal name. 

The dwarves settle these the most densely, so it could be the dwarven name that is universal, maybe something like:
Labkar
Labkhan
Labad
Sheth’abad
Shethrabad
Abadkan

Dunmari
Tushāra
Sveti
Seveti
Svera
Safedi
Safanti
Kavachi

Or could go for something in English:

(on the theme of dividing/guarding/barrier)

Sentinel Range (or the Sentinels)
Great Barrier Range
The Palisades (perhaps too famous in the real world)
The Curtain Range 
Citadel Mountains (or the Citadels)

(on the theme of simple descriptions of tall mountains; could replace Mountains with Range or Peaks in any of these)
White Mountains (not my favorite; too obvious and used in Tolkien + real world)
Snowy Mountains 
Graystorm Mountains
Whitespire Mountains

_Short form: Thundars or The Thunds_

**Frostfang Ridge**  
_Short form: Frostfangs or The Fangs_  
Highlighting the icy, sharp nature of the peaks.

Ultimately probably makes sense that these prominent mountains would have many names, but probably want a primary English name for reference, with alternative dwarven, stoneborn, and perhaps deno'qai or dunmari alternatives
