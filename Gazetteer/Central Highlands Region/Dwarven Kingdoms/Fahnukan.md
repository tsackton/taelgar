%% notes -- from Google Drive
northern, isolated both before and after the war, much less interested in human contact than others, allies of stoneborn, weird volcanic interests? Havenâ€™t thought much about them except they are odd. Perhaps live mostly on the surface despite the cold and north? Have winter homes in the mountains, summer homes on the slopes?
