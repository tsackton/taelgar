# Fahnukan

The northernmost, and most isolated, of the [[Dwarven Kingdoms]] of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]]. 

%% brainstorming - not canon
isolated both before and after the war
much less interested in human contact than others
odd in some way

Ideas:
unusually strong allies of stoneborn?
weird volcanic interests? 
live mostly on the surface despite the cold and north? 
have winter homes in the mountains, summer homes on the slopes?
