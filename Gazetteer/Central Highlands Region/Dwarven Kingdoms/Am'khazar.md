# Am'khazar

The Kingdom of Am’khazar has always been a quiet but wealthy kingdom. During the height of the five kingdoms before the [[Great War]], it was never as powerful as [[Khatridun]], and in the years since it has not risen to the heights of [[Nidzahar]]. But the Am’khun have always been quietly prosperous off their rich mineral wealth, which they trade primarily with other [[Dwarven Kingdoms]]. The kingdom of Am’khazar is in many ways the most Dwarvish of all the five kingdoms, seeming untouched by time or the world shaking events around it, always content to continue their traditional ways and live life as they always have lived.
