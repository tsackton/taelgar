## Overview

Largely untouched by the Great War, the lands of the south contains deserts, jungles, and mystery. 

## Boundaries

- To the north, this region is bordered by the northern edge of the [[~Great Desert~]].
- To the east, this region is bordered by the [[~Eastern Ocean~]].
- To the south, this region is bordered by whatever lies south of the equator.
- To the west, this region is bordered by the hills and badlands that mark the former western border of the Drankorian Empire

## Major Features

This region is shrouded in mystery, and only a few features are rumored. 

- [[~Great Desert~]]: *A vast desert, analogous to something like the Sahara.*
- [[Orekatu]]: *Lizardfolk jungle from Kenzo solo, described as analogous to something like Panama, generally tropical jungle of some kind.*

## Climate

The climate of this region is varied, and not well known, but is exclusively subtropical and tropical.
