# Far North Region
>[!info]+ Summary
> a region in [[Taelgar]]


## Overview

This region of Taelgar spans the distant, rumored north, from the polar coasts in the west, across the strange lands north of [[Pandar]], to the expansive tundra and taiga north of the kenku homelands and the coastal cities of the [[Eastern Green Sea]]. 

## Boundaries


## Climate

This region of Taelgar is nearly entirely within the subpolar or polar climates, a mix of [vast subarctic forests](https://geodiode.com/climate/subarctic) and [barren tundra](https://geodiode.com/climate/tundra). But few rumors or tales come to the south from these regions, and in the distant north, who knows what strange magic may sustain life in unlikely places?
