# The Nevos Sea
>[!info]+ Summary


The sea on the west coast of [[Dunmar]], and where the islands of [[Illoria]] can be found. 

%% Note, there are other small islands here, notes from GDrive:

#### Small Southern Islands

- Historically not really populated, but now home of whatever Illorians fled Chardonian rule
    
- NOT currently ruled by Chardon
    
- Even stronger Caribbean vibe (geographically)
