### ~WesternIslands~

- Thinking this is a isolated society, not necessarily with a strong navy, fairly urbanized with dense agriculture and fishing; maybe use some aspects of historical Japan as a model
    
- Trade with Chardon, but possibly one island is the only one that foreigners are allowed on?
    
- Almost pure “West Northlander” with no imperial influences; very distinct culturally, religiously, and linguistically from rest of world in many ways. Many people don’t speak common, for example.
