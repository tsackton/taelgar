# The West Coast Region
>[!info]+ Information

## Overview

## Boundaries

The West Coast Region includes the entirety of the [[Chardonian Empire]], as well as the [[Nevos Sea]]area, the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], and the [[~Voltara Plains~]], plus the coastal regions west and north of the [[~Voltara Plains~]]. It also includes the islands in the [[Endless Ocean]]. 

- To the north, this region is bordered by the mysterious cold of the [[Far North Region]]. 
- To the east, this region is bordered by the [[~North Nahadi River~]], [[Ainumarya]], and the [[Myraeni Gap]].
- To the south, this region is bordered by the [[Sea of Storms]]and the ocean beyond the [[Nevos Sea]]
- To the west, this region is bordered by the [[Endless Ocean]]

## Major Features

%%much of this region is not well developed, so more uncertainty here; some things can go to worldbuilding or commets as needed%%

- [[~North Chardon Coast~]]: *The wide coastland north of Chardon. Canonically all that is developed about this area is that it is fertile agricultural land. This is approx. 38 N to 45 N latitudes. Probably the southern part is more strictly Mediterranean, with extensive cotton, olive, and wine production (Metium is a major wine-producer), while the northern part is highly productive for grains. Basic geographic/climatic outline is Mediterranean in the south transitioning to a more oceanic influence in the north, with grain cultivation in river valleys and hot-summer crops like olives in the hills. Probably should extend the oceanic climate of Mawar into the northern stretches of this area, around 45 N. Real world influences would include parts of Italy, southern France, and other Med agricultural areas, and California Central Valley.*
- [[Lake Valandros]]: *Huge lake, with no canonical details. Likely somewhat dry on the west side and humid and rainy on the east side, just from mountain influence. Probably also agricultural - rice production for example might be common.*
- [[Mawakel Peninsula]]: *See Mawar notes. Currently unresolved is if this is more of a Cool Maritime Climate (Cfb) with limited winter snow, as currently marked (analogy: coastal Ireland, Pacific NW), or if this is more of a Subpolar Oceanic Climate (Cfc) with heavy winter snowfall and limited agriculture (analogy: Iceland or Norwegian coasts). I guess I have leaned towards the former, with the further north coast beyond Mawar more of the Norway analog.*
- [[~Great Bay~]]: *Lots of land northeast of Mawar. The east coast, near Voltara, has a bit of detail from Great Library campaign, but otherwise this is totally open and undeveloped.*
- [[~Voltara Plains~]]: *Canon: center for chalyte mining - mountainous and arid with extensive plains.*
- [[Tawir Forest]]: *So far just a name.*
- [[Chasa River Valley]]: *agricultural mixed with forests, major population center*
- [[~Yeraad River Valley~]]: *southeast of Chardon, south of Chasa/Elderwood. Major lizardfolk area, mining in the hills that separate it from Chasa, and in the "Darba Mountains". Very little detail otherwise - probably fairly flat, hot in the summer. This is basically med transitioning to semi-arid in the east and south, likely supporting fruit trees near the coast, and extensive livestock, probably the center of the Chardon cattle industry.*
- [[~Emerald Bay Peninsula~]]: *Undeveloped until the kelp forest adventure off the coast.* 
- [[Nevos Sea]] and [[Emerald Bay]]: *trending into subtropics here*

%% comments
- As an aside, thinking about the Chardonian Empire: one of the striking facts that seems to come up all the time in the book about the Mediterranean I read is how desperate a lot of maritime powers were for grain, all the time. Certainly Tollen is in this position. But I think one of Chardon's strengths is just how agriculturally rich the heartland of the empire is. The Chasa River Vally, the North Chardon Coast, and Lake Valandros are all probably incredibly productive agricultural land. Pre-Great-War, Chardon probably relied a lot on trade to supply its food needs; after the Great War, it was packed with refugees and probably suffered a number of famines - as the Chardonian armies conquered north, especially on the west coast, they would be strongly inclined to incorporate the newly freed productive agricultural areas into an empire. I think this also informs the character of the city a lot. Chardon is not really a mercantile superpower - it isn't deeply connected to international trade networks. There is some trade that goes upriver to the dwarves; there is some south with Dunmar, especially for horses and the products of the Nardith; there is some with Mawar. But, mostly, trade is internal. chalyte from the north; grain from the coast; wine from the area around Chardon; metals from the southern areas, the mountains north of Darba and the hills between the Chasa and the Yeraad. Chardon is certainly growing as a naval power and there is likely some decent trade with Illoria, and the occasional brave ship that ventures to cross the Sea of Storms. An implication of this is perhaps that they actually restrict the export of grain, and instead subsidize it internally, so that grain is cheap in Chardon, which helps the city grow fast and extremely big. Most of their exports would be high value tech goods, basically, plus probably wine/olive oil/luxury foodstuff (mostly to dwarves and Dunmar).

## Climate

Most of the extensive coastline of the Chardonian empire, stretching from the mouth of the [[Yeraad]] river to the southern fringes of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], is a temperate region with [[warm or hot summers and wet, cool winters]](https://geodiode.com/climate/mediterranean). The [[Mawakel Peninsula]] itself ...

From old GDrive doc on Geography

Major features include a major river, large forests to the east against the ~CentralMountains~, a large lake on the main river north of Chardon, a significant peninsula extending into the Endless Ocean south of Chardon, and several island systems and a large bay in the north. In the far north, a chain of volcanoes extends from the central mountains, and the land becomes mountainous and covered in glaciers approaching and beyond the arctic circle. The climate is mild, with wet winters and dry summers; pleasant year round temperatures to the south; cold, snowy winters to the north; and significant coastal moderation on the many islands and peninsulas of this region.
