# The Blackwater Fens

The Blackwater Fens are a broad belt of bog and open woodland on the western slopes of the Northern Sentinels. The fens form one of the principal headwaters of the [[Barzhen]], draining south through a maze of peatlands, pools, and meandering channels under frequent mist and low cloud. 

Travel is slow, visibility is often poor, and footing is treacherous. Movement through the fens is slow and hazardous. Reliable routes keep to tree‑lines, natural levees, and firm hummocks; boat travel is possible along the broader channels. Common hazards include unstable ground, hidden sinkholes, wind‑thrown timber, sudden fog, and swarms of biting insects.

## Geography & Climate

The fens are low‑lying peatlands broken by hummocks, sedge flats, and scattered groves on slightly raised ground. Interlaced pools and sluggish channels dominate the surface, and seasonal rains from the western face of the [[Sentinel Range]] periodically inundate large areas.

The [[Barzhen]] serves as the principal outlet, gathering flow from numerous small lakes and and branching streams before departing the wetlands. Together with minor courses, the fens form one of the headwater systems that feed the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], ultimately reaching [[Lake Valandros]]. The waters are typically dark and tannin‑stained.

Winters are long, cold, and wet, with frequent ground mists and occasional crusts of ice that rarely harden across the breadth of the bog. Summers are short and cool, marked by heavy insect hatches and persistent fog along the waterways.

## Ecology

Vegetation transitions from open conifer woodland on better‑drained rises to blankets of bog shrubs, sedges, and mosses across the peat flats. Amphibians and wetland fauna are common. Communities of [[Bullywugs|bullywugs]] occupy portions of the wetlands, especially near reliable fishing grounds and sheltered pools.

Not much canonical history developed, except that there are several stone markers  that might reflect ancient elvish/Deno'qai treaties. similar to the one in the chase valley
