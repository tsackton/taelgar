## Topography and Major Features
Few have mapped this region, but some major features are known, if not named:

* [[Forest of Nightmares]]
* [[Blackwater Fens]]
* North Sentinel Range
* [[~Unnamed North Sentinel Pass~]]
## Civilizations and Cultures
_See more: [[Northern Tribes]], 

There are few humans in this region, although the [[Northern Tribes|northern Deno'qai tribes]] make their home here. The dwarven kingdom of [[Fahnukan]] lies beneath the northern Sentinels, and [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]] are known to live in the highlands and foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]].
## Major Historical Eras
In the ancient days before [[The Downfall]] it is said that the [[~Northerner~|northerners]] crossed the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] at [[~Unnamed North Sentinel Pass~]]  in their eastward migrations, but the truth of this is unclear.

In the long years leading up to the [[Great War]] the land of [[Pandar]] was [[Cha'mutte|Cha'mutte's]] home, and hobgoblins and enslaved [[Kenku|kenku]] were common sights.

## DM Notes and Meta
*Canonical Development and Constraints:* [[Pandar]] was canonically [[Cha'mutte]]'s primary permanent territory, and a large number of kenku enslaved by Cha'mutte lived here prior to the [[Great War]]. The history of the [[History of the Northern Deno'qai|northern Deno'qai]], including some details of the Great War era, and their current [[Northern Tribes|culture and territory]] is well developed. The [[Forest of Nightmares]], and the [[Blackwater Fens]], have some canonical details. Stoneborn, at least, canonically live in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] in this region. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* Some basic overview of the history of Pandar and Cha'mutte's activities exist, but these are largely brainstorming, or at best weakly canonical. 

*Needs Development:* None.

*Intentionally Blank:*  Much of this region is functionally a blank spot. In general, this region was dominated by [[Cha'mutte]] during the [[Great War]] and is best kept relatively empty as a setting for dark and dangerous things.

*Adventures:* The Delwath solo arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign was set in the northern Deno'qai territory and the Forest of Nightmares; the black dragon arc of the Great Library campaign was set in the Blackwater Fens. 

*Important Places in Staging:* None.
