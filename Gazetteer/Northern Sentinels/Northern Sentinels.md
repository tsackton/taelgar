# The Northern Sentinels

North of the [[Dwarven Kingdoms]] and the plains of [[Voltara]] is a wild and unpeopled land, haunted with the scars of the [[Great War]]. Pine forests, swamps, and the tall peaks of the [[Sentinel Range#Northern Sentinels|northern Sentinels]] dominate the landscape.

## Topography and Major Features
_See more: [[Sentinel Range#Northern Sentinels|North Sentinels]]_

Few have mapped this region, nestled on the west side of the [[Sentinel Range]]. Much of the region dominated by the northern Sentinels and the forests and rivers on the western slopes. The [[Northern Tribes|scattered human tribes]] in the area speak of the dangerous forests and swamps:
* the [[Forest of Nightmares]], said to be in haunted, cursed by [[Cha'mutte]] during the [[Great War]]
* the [[Blackwater Fens]], a dank bog from which the [[Nahadi]] arises
## Civilizations and Cultures
_See more: [[Northern Tribes]] 

There are few humans in this region, although the [[Northern Tribes|northern Deno'qai tribes]] make their home here. The dwarven kingdom of [[Fahnukan]] lies beneath the northern Sentinels, and [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]] are known to live in the highlands and foothills of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]].
## Major Historical Eras
_See more: [[Pandar]]_

In the ancient days before [[The Downfall]] it is said that the [[~Northerner~|northerners]] crossed the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] at the [[~Unnamed North Sentinel Pass~]]  in their eastward migrations, but the truth of this is unclear.

In the long years leading up to the [[Great War]] the land of [[Pandar]] was [[Cha'mutte|Cha'mutte's]] home, and hobgoblins and enslaved [[Kenku|kenku]] were common sights. Since the [[Great War]] this area has been lightly populated and full of dangers.
## Climate
The mountains here are snowy, rocky, and volcanic, marked by pine forests on the western slopes and long, bitter winters. The forests and fens to the west are marked by cold, snowy winters and short, wet summers. There is little farmable land here.

***Real world analogs:*** This region is at approx. 52 degrees north, and probably has some similarities with the Canadian Rockies, especially Banff and Jasper national parks, including the flat plains to the east of the mountains (in the [[Far North]]). The volcanic mountains of [[Pandar]] share some similarities with the Pacific Ring of Fire, but with a much more magical vibe, and less moderating coastal influence on climate. 

- [[Blackwater Fens]]: *not really developed; was the home to a black dragon in the [[Great Library campaign]], unpleasant but not frozen in the winter. Around 50 degrees North. There is probably not a great real world analogy, the basic idea is something like a temperate version of a [peat swamp forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peat_swamp_forest). Maybe a place like [here](https://www.visitestonia.com/en/where-to-go/west-estonia/soomaa-national-park) or just a more northerly version of the Great Dismal Swamp or something like that.* 

The fens probably have a similar ecosystem to the [Hudson Bay bog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hudson_Bay_taiga), although perhaps a little bit warmer -- an "insect-infested landscape ofÂ bog and fog".

## DM Notes and Meta
*Canonical Development and Constraints:* [[Pandar]] was canonically [[Cha'mutte]]'s primary permanent territory, and a large number of kenku enslaved by Cha'mutte lived here prior to the [[Great War]]. The history of the [[History of the Northern Deno'qai|northern Deno'qai]], including some details of the Great War era, and their current [[Northern Tribes|culture and territory]] is well developed. The [[Forest of Nightmares]], and the [[Blackwater Fens]], have some canonical details. Stoneborn, at least, canonically live in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] in this region. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* Some basic overview of the history of Pandar and Cha'mutte's activities exist, but these are largely brainstorming, or at best weakly canonical. 

*Needs Development:* None.

*Intentionally Blank:*  Much of this region is functionally a blank spot. In general, this region was dominated by [[Cha'mutte]] during the [[Great War]] and is best kept relatively empty as a setting for dark and dangerous things.

*Adventures:* The Delwath solo arc of the Dunmar Frontier campaign was set in the northern Deno'qai territory and the Forest of Nightmares; the black dragon arc of the Great Library campaign was set in the Blackwater Fens. 

*Important Places in Staging:* None.
