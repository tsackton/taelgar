### Erlona

Provincial is the capital of the Chasa Valley province. A rich and powerful province given the agricultural wealth of the valley. This far upriver, there is less wine, but it is fertile pastureland and lots of cattle and dairy.

%% Notes
The most notable feature is a large coliseum/stadia. This houses the famous Forvitan Games, an annual gladiatorial competition, held in late September and associated with the Feast of the Warlord that marks the beginning of autumn and the first harvest.

As this is also the provincial capital, plenty of amenities here, and significant number of rich estates.

Architecturally a new city. Vibe is rich/cultured/theater/decadence.
