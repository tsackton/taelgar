### Notes

Metium was a small city in the orbit of [[Chardon]] in the pre-war period; even then it had a reputation as a trading post, wine center, and crossroads, with significant river traffic. During and just after war, attracted lots of fleeing refugees and grew quickly, enlarging the walls twice. Was the site of [[Chardon]]'s victorious climatical battle during the [[Blood Years]].

The most notable landmark is the massive Triumphal Arch in the center of the market square, commemorating the great victory over the hobgoblins and dragon conclave. Almost as significant is the Tomb of the Valiant Defender, another monument to honor that war.

In the current day, Metium is mostly known as the center of a major wine growing region. There is considerable wine trade through Metium's river port, both downriver to [[Chardon]] for local consumption or export, and upriver to [[Arendum]] or Lake Valandros for local consumption.
