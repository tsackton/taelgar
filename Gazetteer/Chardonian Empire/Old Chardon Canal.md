### The Chardon Canal

Variously referred to as the [[Chardon]] Canal, the Old [[Chardon]] Canal, the Great [[Chardon]] Canal, or just the Canal, this is an 87 mile long sea-level canal that connects the Endless Ocean near [[Chardon]] with the Emerald Bay and the [[Nevos Sea]]. 

Built with magic by the Drankorians, and currently navigated by windcallers, who use magic to steer ships through the often windless passage. 

%% Canal notes
The canal was created by the Drankorians, with high magic. It is a sea-level canal with an artificial lake in the center, excavated with extensive magical aid, including two cuts through hills in the middle.

During the time of the [[Drankorian Empire]], was primarily navigated by galleys, moving in convoys coordinated with message stones, as there is not sufficient room for north and southbound traffic to pass except at the lake.

After the fall of [[Drankor]], control of the canal fell to various warlords and minor kingdoms. After the [[Great War]], it was briefly controlled by Chire as part of the Illorian Confederacy, but after his defeat at [[Darba]] and subsequent death split from [[Illoria]] and was essentially a separate pirate kingdom, until after the [[Chardon]]/Hobgoblin wars were resolved and [[Chardon]] turned its attention to empire. The canal was one of the first conquests of the growing Chardonian empire, and has been under Chardonian control since.

With the rediscovery and refinement of chalyte, passage of sailing ships through the canal became possible. Specialized mages known as windcallers, drawing on chalyte and the power of the ley line that the canal follows, serve as pilots to guide sailing ships through, even with unfavorable winds.

### Canal Passage

The canal itself is 87 miles long.

The first 10 miles or so of the canal are a tidal estuary, and ships sail to ENTRANCE FORT where they are boarded and a windcaller pilot is placed. Traffic is still coordinated. Under control of a windcaller, ships can make about 4 miles per hour, and so expect to clear the 25 miles to the lake in about 6 hours. Typically northbound ships have the right of way until early afternoon, and southbound ships have the right of way from then until evening.

Overnight anchorage is possible in the lake, where windcallers depart and new one joins for the northern leg, which is about 50 miles. Traveling at 4 miles per hour, this passage takes 12 hours, with one point in the middle where two ships can pass abreast, so there is typically one convoy transit north and one convoy transit south each day, timed to meet at the passage point.

Thus, it is possible to make the transit in one day, by departing ENTRANCE FORT well before dawn to make the northbound morning convoy, or pushing on into the night from LAKE after the southern convoy. But more typically, ships overnight at the anchorage in LAKE, making the transit in two days.

### Description

Mile 1 - entrance, on a tidal estuary; small city on the coast to the west (Pergia)

Mile 10 - Fort Ameli, old Drankorian fort guarding canal proper. Required to dock, and queue for wildcaller pilot and appropriate canal entrance time, and pay the toll.

Mile 10 - 22 - quiet stretch, essentially seems like a river but runs unnaturally straight.

Mile 23-31- The Cut, a narrow gorge through the hills with cliff walls stretching up to 300' high, clearly cut by magic.

Mile 31 - 35 - Stillwater Lake, anchorage and services, unnaturally calm, in a bowl

Mile 35 - 36 - The Narrows, a second cut exiting the bowl of the lake, narrowest part of the canal

Mile 36 - 55 - quiet stretch, winds more

Mile 56 -Â  Lake Cirelus, joins with the route of a river

Mile 57 - 77 - follows the river, but wider

Mile 77 - 85 - marshlands, dug out and dredged by magic

Mile 87 - Fort Varian on a prominence in the salt marshes. City is some distance away to the east on more solid ground (Nevium)

### Scene

Generally speaking, the windcallers have some magic and will potentially be alert to others carrying magic with them, e.g. via detect magic. Not that they will necessarily care.

Possible the party will see none of this if they all hide in the mirror. Will have to improvise and see how things go.
