### The University of Chardon

A great center of learning and teaching in Chardon, famous throughout Taelgar. Organized into the Chardonian Lecti, a series of undergraduate colleges, that employ masters to teach undergraduates. 

The five higher faculty sit above the colleges and form the basis of graduate education: the Faculty of Magic, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Theology (includes medicine and healing), the Faculty of History, and the Faculty of Metaphysics (includes the supernatural and planar studies).

%% Notes

Founded in DR 980, and greatly expanded in DR 1065 by refugees from Drankor fleeing the Plague and subsequent collapse of the empire. Grew out of the Great Library, but carried over some knowledge and traditions from the University of Drankor. In the current day, largely devoted to the education of students - draw from medieval and early Renaissance universities historically. Organized into colleges, courses taught by masters, lower/higher subjects (with magic considered one of the higher subjects, requiring completion of the lower course to study), general debauchery of student life, etc. The higher faculties operate separately of the colleges, but undergraduate education is organized by the individual colleges. Funds come from student fees, the imperial state, benefactors, the temple, and sometimes more unusual sources, and are not centralized (so each college / faculty pays its masters/tutors from its own funds). The colleges are mostly known as XXXX Hall or XXXX Lectum, and are referred to collectively as the Chardonian Lecti. The five higher faculty are referred to as faculties. They are: the Faculty of Magic, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Theology (includes medicine and healing), the Faculty of History, and the Faculty of Metaphysics (includes the supernatural and planar studies).

The University operates under its original Drankorian Charter still, and thus claims to be above the laws and politics of the modern city. Students who are accused of crimes can only be tried and punished by the university courts, although the Imperial bureaucracy claims the ability to confine students to university grounds without trial (which is occasionally contentious).

While the university controls the largest portion of land in the Academia Quarter (Precinct IV), it is somewhat disorganized as there is often considerable competition among the various halls and lecti for students and masters, and thus it generally welds less real political power than the Hetaeri Magica or the Great Library.

The disorganization is probably subtly encouraged by the Imperial state to keep the University from becoming a major alternate power base.
