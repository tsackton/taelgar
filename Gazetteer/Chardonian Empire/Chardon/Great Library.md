### The Great Library

The oldest building and organization in Chardon, dedicated to collecting and preserving knowledge, often in the form of books and scholarly works, though the Great Library also funds adventuring expeditions to recover more esoteric treasure. 

%% Notes

Founded in DR 688 in the developing city of Chardon, originally as the Sibyline Archives, a branch of one of the secret orders of Chardon devoted to the secret knowledge of the Sibyl. Rebranded as the Great Library in DR 1063, after the fall of Drankor.

Its roots are in the ancient secret societies and magical orders of Drankor, and this shows in its modern traditions and activities. Historically, the scholars at the library were salaried by the state, and funded to preserve knowledge and the written word of the empire. They would also be expected to advise the Imperium on matters as needed, and occasionally present lectures or demonstrations to students.

After the fall of Drankor, the Library was funded directly by the newly formed Hetaeri Magica, which had sources of income originally from the sale of spells and works of magic. It now receives some funding from the state as well as still receiving funds from the Hetaeri Magica, and some scholars may be independently wealthy or supported by patrons. In practice, the Hetaeri Magica functions as the board of directors for the library.

These days, the library has expanded greatly and is involved in adventuring / collecting as well as preservation of books. Kind of like an archaeological museum and a library combined - and receives considerable funding through the sale of treasures recovered by its adventurer-scholars.

Scholars with full privileges are known as Archivists, with Junior and Senior ranks in addition to the 'main' base rank. Senior Archivists are effectively "department chairs" and the committee of senior archivists chooses the staff to run the library, including the Dean of the Library and the Chancellor. Scholars without full privileges are typically just referred to as scholars or masters (depending on their rank at the university).
