# The World of Taelgar

%% Rewrite; tagging Tim to review %%
%% See [[Geography - Open Questions]] for some unresolved general questions about the world %%

The world of Taelgar is a globe, slightly bigger than Earth, with Earth-like seasons and climate and am Earth-like [[Sun|sun]], [[Moon]], and [[Stars|stars]]. The main landmass stretches from the [[Endless Ocean]] in the west across more than 5,000 miles of mountains, forests, rivers, swamps, farmland, desolation and deserts to the mysterious [[~Eastern Ocean~|east]].  

Many mapmakers consider the mighty [[Sentinel Range]], whose highest peaks rise more than 20,000 feet into the air, the defining feature of the land. The [[Sentinel Range|Sentinel's]] 2,500 miles of mountains and foothills divide the world into three: 
* to the west, [[Chardon]], the great city of magic and learning, by the mouth of the the mighty [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], and the smaller [[Yeraad Watershed|Yeraad River]], to the south
* to the south, the great [[Dunmari Basin]], arid and windswept, cut off from the [[Nevos Sea]] by the [[Yuvanti Mountains]]
* to the east, the [[Greater Sembara|realms of Sembara, Tyrwingha, and Vostok]] on the shores of the [[Western Gulf]] of the [[Green Sea]]

The halflings navigating the [[Green Sea]] would tell a different tale, as they sailed the 3,000 miles of rugged coasts, mysterious islands, and northern forests. They would talk of the [[Northern Green Sea|northern forests]], the mysterious island of [[Irrla]], the volcanic [[Skaerhem]], and the [[Cymean Peninsula]], steeped in history. They would tell you that the familiar lands of [[Greater Sembara|Sembara and Tollen]] are just the beginning of never-ending road, running through the waves and currents of the [[Green Sea]].

If you were lucky enough to find a ancient map from [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], the ruined and haunted center of a once-mighty empire, it would show you that the [[Istaros]], flowing for nearly 2,000 miles from the [[Mostreve Hills]] to the shores of the [[Sea of Storms]], was the lifeblood of fortune and empire. Today though, the river runs only through the fallen city of [[Isingue]], and many other places that were once fertile and beautiful, that are now cursed by [[Plaguelands|plague]] and [[Desolation of Cha'mutte|desolation]].

### Oceans and Boundaries
The known world is bounded by the [[Endless Ocean]] in the west and the [[~Eastern Ocean~]] in the east. The lands to the north and south are intentionally vague and mysterious, to preserve blank spaces on the map for future adventures.
### Major Regions
To ease worldbuilding, Taelgar is divided up into 13 regions, listed approximately from northwest-southeast:

1. the [[Northwest Coast]], in the far northwest, home to the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]
2.  [[Greater Chardon]], home to the city of [[Chardon]] and much of its vast [[Chardonian Empire|empire]]
3.  [[Nevos and Apporia]], home to the islands of [[Illoria]] and the mysterious [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]]
4. the [[Northern Sentinels]], once the realm of [[Pandar]], homeland of [[Cha'mutte]], now dangerous place with few permanent settlements
5. the [[Central Highlands]], home to the [[Sentinel Range]] and the great forests of [[Ainumarya]] and the [[Elderwood]]
6. [[Greater Dunmar]], the land of the [[Dunmar|Dunmari]], changed significantly since the [[Great War]]
7.  [[Greater Sembara]], the place of the old and stable realms of [[Sembara]] and [[Tyrwingha]], as well as the rivers and forests of [[Vostok]] and the famous port and trading city, the [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]]
8. the [[Upper Istaros]], dominated by the [[Istaros]], once [[Isingue|rich farmlands]], now mostly cursed [[Plaguelands]] full of ash and danger, but with scattered [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez|human]], [[Xurkhaz|orc]], and [[Orenlas|elf]] communities on the edges
9. the [[Drankorian Hinterland]], once the heartland of the [[Drankorian Empire]], now a place of [[Desolation of Cha'mutte|desolation]] and danger
10. the [[Northern Green Sea]], dominated by mighty northern forests, and home to the mysterious land of [[Ursk]]
11. the [[Western Green Sea]], where the [[Skaerhem|Skaer Islands]] are, as well as the [[Cymean Peninsula]] and other descendant civilizations of Drankor
