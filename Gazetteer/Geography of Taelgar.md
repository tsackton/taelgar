# The World of Taelgar

The world of Taelgar is a globe, slightly bigger than Earth, with Earth-like seasons and climate. Two major continents, and other possible minor or unknown continents, make up the world, with the northern continent, which stretches from just south of the equator to the arctic circle, the center of all campaigns set in Taelgar to date.  

The northern continent is surrounded by four major bodies of water. To the west, the [[Endless Ocean]] stretches for thousands of miles of trackless oceans into the west. To the south, along the south coast of [[Dunmar]], the [[Sea of Storms]] stretches south and west, to the shattered shores of the ancient, now sunken, continent of [[Hkar]]. Further south, the [[~Southern Ocean~]] forms a narrow channel full of islands, and several large bays, between the northern and southern continents. To the north, the [[~Arctic Ocean~]] is an icy, cold place where few travel. To the east, the [[~Great Ocean~]] is separated from the [[Green Sea]] by the mysterious [[~Eastern Islands~]]. 

The northern continent is marked by three major, continent scale features. In the east, the [[Green Sea]] extends from the eastern edge of the continent to nearly the middle, forming a great sea stretching 3000 miles from end to end. South of the Green Sea, the [[~Great Desert~]] forms a band across the southern part of the continent, stretching nearly from the [[Sea of Storms]] to the [[~Eastern Ocean~]]. West of the Green Sea, the high peaks of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] run nearly the entire length of the continent from north to south. These barriers divide the continent into a handful large-scale geographic regions.

- The [[West Coast Region]], stretching from the the [[Endless Ocean]] to the [[Sentinel Range]] and including the coastal islands in the Endless Sea and as far north as the icy cold of the [[~Arctic Ocean~]]
%% comment - I've put the Deno'qai forests in the Central Highlands, not West Coast; mostly this is based on river borders but many of the rivers don't have names yet, so at some point this will need to be updated.%%
- The [[Western Green Sea Region]], stretching from the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] west to [[Irrla]] in the [[Green Sea]]
- The [[Eastern Green Sea Region]]], stretching from [[Irrla]] east to the mysterious [[~Eastern Islands~]]
* The [[Far North Region]], covering the frozen north 
* The [[South Region]], stretching from the [[~Great Desert~]] south to the [[~Southern Ocean~]]
* The [[Central Lowlands Region]], stretching from the southern end of [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] to the [[Sea of Storms]]
* The [[Central Highlands Region]], including the [[Sentinel Range]] and the areas on the western slopes of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] 

Beyond the [[~Southern Ocean~]] is the mysterious [[~Southern Continent~]] of which little is known.Â
