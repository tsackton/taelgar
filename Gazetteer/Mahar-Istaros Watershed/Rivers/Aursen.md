### River Aursen
The Aursen falls rapidly out of the [[Sentinel Range]] before become wide and gentle as it flows east. Once the [[Douren|Douren]] joins it, it falls rapidly through a series of six large waterfalls before joining the [[Masance]] to become the [[Ardonne]].

The Aursen starts in the foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]] about 50 miles north of the headwaters of the [[Douren|Douren]]. But in character and path, it is very different. The land here is flatter â€“ rocky and with poor soil, but studded with the occasional stand of pines, and the river flows gently and widely for 75 miles, before dropping in a series of large waterfalls off the plateau, to lower ground. The land around the Aursen is marshy and productive, although hard to farm. A small lizardfolk community lives here since time immemorial, and they are much honored for the welcome and shelter they gave to the first refugees.
