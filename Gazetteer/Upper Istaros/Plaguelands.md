# The Plaguelands

The Plaguelands are a region centered around the upper [[Istaros]] and the ruined city of [[Isingue]] that was heavily affected by [[Cha'mutte's Plague]] at the end of the [[Great War]]. What few tales come out of the Plaguelands hint at strange magic, unnatural features, and chaotic monstrosities. 

Although the exact borders of the Plaguelands are not precisely defined, the region is generally considered to stretch east from the banks of the [[Douren]] and south from a line running from the southern edges of the [[March of Andonne]] and the [[Darkwood]] to the [[~Orenlas Tributary Lake~]]. The eastern and southern extent of the Plaguelands is not well mapped. 

The western edge of the Plaguelands, along the banks of the [[Andonne]] and the [[Douren]], is am arid, ashy, dusty plain, dotted with the occasional hill or broken crack in the ground. Little grows here except the occasional thorny shrub in sheltered dells where rain collects. A series of valleys and rolling hills once graced the broad land between the [[Istaros]] and the [[Kulthul]]; now scouting reports say this is a land of great upthrust cliffs and cracked barren stone. The [[Istaros]] river valley itself is reported to remain a lush riparian forest, though what strange trees grow in the cursed waters of the upper Istaros remains a mystery.
