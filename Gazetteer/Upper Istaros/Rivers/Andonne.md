# The Andonne

The Andonne is formed by the confluence of the [[Masance]] and the [[Aursen]], and flows for almost 300 miles until it joins the [[Valmont]] at [[Lake Aeulian]]. The western quarter of the river runs swiftly with numerous rapids, until a particularly sequence of rapids and waterfalls known as the Washbasin. Since the Great War, the river, east of the Washbasin, has been ash-choked and corrupted, and unsafe to drink.
