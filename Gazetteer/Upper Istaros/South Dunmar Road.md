A major trade road that departs from the [[Maseau - Dunmar Road]] just south of the [[Aursen]], crosses the [[Douren|Douren River]] as [[Heuren Gorge]], runs along western foothills of the [[Sentinel Range]] through Stoneborn settlements, past [[Gazetteer/Greater Dunmar/Hara Basin/Raven's Hold]], and eventually to [[Karawa]].

%% who actually built this road left somewhat ambiguous. maybe Stoneborn? %%
