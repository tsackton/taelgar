%% dm frontmatter, missing details? %%

The broad, flat Andonne Plain stretches from the eastern edge of the [[Aurbez Plateau]] across the upper [[Masance]] toward [[Westcliff]] and the eaves of the [[Darkwood]]. It is a land of scrubby grasses and small, hardy trees, where rain is scarce and much of the year’s water comes from spring snowmelt and sudden floods after thunderstorms. 

Most settlement lies along the upper Masance and the [[Maseau - Dunmar Road]], where marcher lords of the [[March of Andonne]] maintain fortified ranches and waystops, which provide shelter from the ash storms that sweep the region. Few venture close to the [[Andonne]] itself, whose corrupted waters are part of the greater peril of the [[Plaguelands]].

%% Lightly settled frontier ranchland, increasingly choked by ash since the [[Great War]]: see [[Upper Istaros]] and [[Aurbez and the Andonne]]. %%
