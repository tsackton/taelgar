The Aursen Marshes are a marshy area of the [[Aursen|Aursen River]], predominantly occupying a basin and depression near the edge of the [[Aurbez Plateau]] escarpment. The marshes themselves are largely inhabited by [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] and the occasional homesteader who does not mind the flooding the spring snowmelt brings. The area itself is a productive agricultural region and the edges of the marshes are intensively farmed by the people of the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]].
