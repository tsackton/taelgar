The below is a start, but needs collation with a bunch of discussions on discord, in email, etc as part of the planning around both [[Isingue]] and my Ausson's mini series
#### The Refounded Alliance of Aurbez

- Founded by two groups -- a core of refugees from the collapse of Insingue who hid out in the hills during the blood years, and developed a bit of a guerilla culture also supported the rangers a fair bit, second a group of folks who settled in Maseau or even the western marches for a bit, but were attracted by the growing rumors of an Insinguen  culture / group
    
- These people explicitly call back to Insingue as kinda their founding ideal / lost homeland
    
- Welcoming to travelers but very protective of their prerogative to the land, conceptually believe they have a claim to any habitable parts of the plaguelands, fiercely independent
    
- Rebuilding not foreign affairs is real goal, but claims to be the heirs of Insignue and claims sovereignty over all the lands south of Maseau and north of Insingue
    
- Major settlements are along the Aursen, along the Dunmar Road, in the foothills and valleys of the Douren, and in the high elevations from the source of the Aursen to the source of the Mansance

Some notes from the player introduction to the Aussons Mini Series. Does not have to be 100% canonical. This is also supposed to be from the 1680s perspective:

**Climate**

The area is dominated by a large mountain chain to the west and the Plaguelands to the east. It is a marginal land, with hot, dry summers when the ash-wind blows from the east and cold, dry winters when the westerlies blow over the mountains. The main rainfall is in the spring, when in lucky years several soaking rains will replenish the land, and in the summer when the punishing thunderstorms race from the east, bringing flash floods, lightning, and hail. In autumn the rivers shrink, and the temperature is briefly moderate before the cooler winters come.  

The flora and fauna is reminiscent of central Spain or highland Mexico - some elk and bison in the higher regions, pines and sequoias and similar trees, but definitely not a lush New England forest.
  

**People**

The main inhabitants are the Aurbeze (aur-bez-e), named after the Aurbez plateau which rises just to the west of the Last Inn. These people are mostly refugees from the Istabor River valley (which used to be a great fertile river delta until a magical red mist spread over the land and killed everyone who didn't manage to flee. Now it is a dry dusty wasteland with no people but plenty of scary things).
 
They have built small settler communities and fortified ranch houses (think Mexican hacienda complexes) and have started to try to eke a living out of the land, mostly herding goats, some hunting, and a little bit of small-scale farming and fishing nearer the rivers.

They also have a decent amount of trade with Sembara driven by explorers and miners who pick through the dwarven ruins for easily accessible metals and ores and ship them north.
 
 The main controversy in this community is about their identity: are they the descendants of Insingue (the largest city in the Istabor valley), destined to reclaim their lost greatness? Or are they smallholders, farmers, and herders, just looking to their children and grandchildren's future, making whatever decisions seem best to ensure a peaceful future? Should they be a great power, or a backwater?

  
**History**

After Great War this particular region was barren for a couple of years, and as the dwarves fled south in those early years the region would have been awash in chaos. Black storms of unnatural ash falling on the ground for weeks. Hobgoblin armies passing through, fleeing who knows what. Dark things emerging from the old dwarven mines. But in this time a small trickle of humans started fortifying caves up in the mountains, or building small highly fortified villages. They drifted in from the Istabor valley, for the most part, all with various tales about the terrors they fled or faced escaping and finding their way across a wasteland. Some also came in from the south, where the cataclysm of the end of the war had reshaped the very earth, raising a new set of mountains. 

But for maybe a generation of humans, these refugees stayed hidden, as did you -- the land was dangerous. But as time passed, and the human kingdoms established themselves, and the plague winds shrunk to mere normal ash, the region started to grow a bit. The original refugees had children, as humans are wont to do, and the land, if not bountiful, was at least empty.

  
The real change has happened in the last 50 years though. Queen Cece of Sembara ushered in an age of peace and prosperity. She built a road through the region, and more settlers started drifting in: not just people with ancient connections to the Istabor valley, who heard rumors of their culture being preserved here, but also anyone looking for a new start, some free land, etc.

This time is when the Inn was founded, the mining and metal trade started, and the political controversies above started.
