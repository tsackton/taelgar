# The Refounded Alliance of Aurbez

The Refounded Alliance of Aurbez is a loose confederation of highland communities in the Upper Istaros, occupying the [[Aurbez Plateau]] and the surrounding foothills. It stands as a hard-edged borderland between the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and the [[Plaguelands]], where ash-winds, raiders, and the lingering dangers of ruined lands shape daily life.

## Geography

The heart of the Alliance is the [[Aurbez Plateau]] itself: a high country of rushing brooks fed by snowmelt, scattered stands of quaking aspens and highland pines, and broad upland meadows. Small farms and clusters of villages cling to reliable water; goat and sheep herders range the rougher slopes; and miners and prospectors work marginal claims in the hills.

The largest settlements lie near the marshy upper [[Aursen]], where the river slows and meanders across the plateau before spilling off the escarpment in a series of large waterfalls. The [[Aursen Marshes]] are a cultural and agricultural heartland: lizardfolk communities have lived there for generations, and the farms on the marsh edges feed much of the plateau.

## Climate

The Aurbez is a marginal land. Summers are hot and dry, and in bad years the ash-wind blows out of the east for days at a time. Winters are cold and dry, with snow more common on the plateau than in the lowlands. The most reliable rains come in spring; in summer, violent thunderstorms can bring flash floods, lightning, and hail.

## People and Culture

The Alliance is settled by a mix of families who fled the destruction of [[Isingue]] during the [[Great War]], later arrivals drawn by frontier opportunity, and longtime neighbors who never truly left these uplands. The lizardfolk of the [[Aursen Marshes]] are much honored in local custom for the welcome and shelter they gave to the first refugee families.

Among the humans of the plateau, it is common to hear the people called the Aurbeze. Their culture blends hard frontier practicality with older memories of the lost river-valley homeland: in some households, Isingue is spoken of as an inheritance to be reclaimed; in others, as a warning against pride, and a reason to build a quieter future in the high country.

## Governance and Defense

The Alliance has no single ruler. It is a web of oaths, councils, and customary obligations between communities, renewed whenever danger forces neighbors to stand together. For many years, [[Three Wells]] has served as a common gathering place where disputes are settled and the frontier’s course is debated.

Defense is organized locally. Each settlement maintains its own watch and militia, and in times of need communities muster together under leaders chosen as much for trust and experience as for rank. [[The Rangers]] move among these communities as scouts and messengers, advising and coordinating, and keeping the most dangerous ways between settlements as safe as they can.

## Economy and Trade

The Aurbez supports small-scale farming where water allows it, fishing along the upper Aursen, and herding across the plateau and foothills. Prospectors and scavengers also work the margins of the old dwarven lands of [[Ardith]], bringing ore, tools, and salvage to market when they can.

Trade follows the [[Maseau - Dunmar Road]]. The road’s traffic grows year by year, and the market town of [[Aursenbourg]] thrives on caravans and the exchange of mountain goods for necessities brought in from beyond the frontier. Its stone bridge—built in DR 1732—has turned the Aursen crossing into a reliable gateway between plateau and lowlands.

## Settlements

- [[Aursen Marshes]]: A marshy basin on the upper [[Aursen]], home to lizardfolk communities and productive farms on the drier edges.
- [[Aursenbourg]]: A walled market town at the Aursen crossing, grown up around the road and the bridge.
- [[Three Wells]]: A fortified gathering place on the plateau, where councils meet and where a watchtower maintained by [[The Rangers]] keeps vigil over the approaches.
- [[Laicon]]: A small village along the road, known as a trading point for goods brought down from the plateau.
- [[Ausson's Crossing]]: A bustling inn in Laicon, founded as a trading outpost where steep tracks descend from the plateau.

## History

Local tradition holds that the plateau was among the first safer refuges after the fall of [[Isingue]], and many families trace their roots to those who fled west into the high country in the years after the war. Over the generations that followed, the Aurbez weathered raids and hardship from the east and south, and its scattered settlements learned to rely on one another.

Old stories and place-names remember an early alliance of humans, lizardfolk, and stoneborn in the defense of the highlands, and it is from these memories—renewed again and again in times of danger—that the Refounded Alliance takes its name.

## DM notes

- *Canonical development:* The Alliance’s detailed politics and history (especially after the 1680s) are only lightly sketched in current notes. See [[Upper Istaros]] and [[Old Region Page for Notes]].
- *Hobgoblin pressure:* Hobgoblin raiders along the western edge of the [[Plaguelands]] are canonically possible; the exact organization and strength of these groups is not settled. See [[Hobgoblin Movements After Cha'Mutte]].

### Archived source notes (pre-rewrite)


%% history notes - expanded

- after Avatus defeat, some isolated hobgoblin groups establish in this area, generally harried from the west by dwarves and the east by Isinguese, but generally find a few isolated places on the plateau and the forests below to survive - neither dwarves not Isinguese are actively at war. this is basically a rump of Avatus, which comes to be ruled by [[Revaka]]. 
- lizardfolk return to the Aursen marshes in this time as well, but very lightly settled. there are much more extensive lizardfolk settlements east of Isingue
- in run up to Great War, hobgoblin population expands under Cha'mutte's watch, and many of these hobgoblins form the core of the Southern Army
- during Great War, plague never reaches within 100 miles of the plateau. hobgoblin total war mobilization. siege of isingue, etc. 
- Battle of Motanga Pass - probably part of Great War; Stoneborn victory that routed hobgoblin rearguard and drove hobgoblins off the plateau
- DR 1545 - DR 1555 refugees settle, mix of humans and lizardfolk from Isingue area. initially mostly along the Aursen mashes and upper plateau above the pass, and beginning to move a little bit north at times. this is when the heartroot is hidden. 
- DR 1555 - DR 1557  [[Three Kin's War]], fought by humans/lizardfolk/stoneborn (with stoneborn as the dominate power) against hobgoblins. this is when three wells is established. 
- DR 1560s - DR 1600s quiet, population slowly grows. hobgoblin raids from the south are a constant problem. rangers grow.
- DR 1610s - final defeat of hobgoblins by Dunmar. trade begins to creep north. 
- DR 1620s - DR 1630s. road regularly opened from Dunmar to Aursen, though few travel north of there and March is still quite dangerous. 
- DR 1650s - DR 1680s - wave of settlement after hobgoblin wars end, especially in March of Andonne. road fully open to Sembara. 
- DR 1670s - DR 1710s - much debate about politics - Isingue as past or future, etc. 
- DR 1720 - War of the [[War of the Ashen Horde|Ashen Hoard]]. Mutual defense pacts and militias organized; alliance is refounded. this is when the "Refounded Aliliance" name is coined.

%% newer, more up to date inforrmation but not yet a full narrative

## **1. Mutual Defense Militias**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Every plateau community is bound to a **mutual defense league** coordinated loosely by the Rangers. Able-bodied adults are expected to keep arms ready, and militia drills are held seasonally, often timed to fairs or council gatherings. Each settlement is responsible for mustering its own fighters, but when a major threat looms, horn signals or mounted messengers summon the league to a rally point. The Rangers act as liaisons and strategic advisors but have no formal authority to command once the militia gathers — leadership falls to whoever commands the most trust or has the most experience for that threat.

---

**Historical Parallels:**

- **Eidgenossenschaften (Swiss Confederation Alliances)**  
    In late medieval Switzerland, independent valleys and small towns swore mutual oaths — the _Eidgenossenschaften_ — to defend one another against external aggression. These alliances were built on reciprocity; each community promised to muster its men-at-arms if another was attacked. Militia training varied from valley to valley, but regular musters and shooting contests helped keep martial skills sharp. Leadership during crises often fell to those with prior military experience or political clout, but authority reverted to local councils once the danger passed.
    
- **Landsgemeinde Muster Obligations**  
    In some Swiss cantons, the _Landsgemeinde_ (popular assembly) could vote to mobilize all able-bodied men between specific ages. Service was unpaid but seen as an honor and duty. Men were expected to provide their own weapons — typically halberds or crossbows in the 14th–15th centuries — and sometimes armor, though poorer members might receive communal equipment. After the threat passed, forces were immediately disbanded to return to farm work.

## **2. Local Councils and Collective Decision-Making**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Each hamlet or village cluster maintains a **council ring** where household heads meet to decide grazing rights, irrigation schedules, mutual defense commitments, and trade agreements. When larger threats arise, **regional councils** are convened at neutral sites like _Three Wells_, drawing together leaders from multiple settlements. Decisions are reached by consensus or near-unanimity — forcing compromises that preserve unity. Rangers often attend as neutral mediators but cannot impose policy.

---

**Historical Parallels:**

- **Norwegian Things**  
    In Viking Age and medieval Norway, the _thing_ was a public assembly where all free men could attend and speak. These gatherings settled disputes, confirmed laws, and coordinated military expeditions. Decisions were made collectively, often with negotiation between local chieftains and common farmers. The _thing_ met at fixed sites — usually open fields or clearings with symbolic stones — reinforcing its role as neutral ground.
    
- **Basque Batzars**  
    In the Basque provinces, the _batzar_ or _batzarre_ was a parish-level assembly where heads of households, including widows, had a voice. These councils handled communal resources like pasture land, mills, and irrigation systems. Meetings were often held under a large tree or in front of the parish church, symbolizing transparency and community ownership of decisions. Voting was sometimes by show of hands, but many decisions aimed for unanimous consent.

## **3. Dispersed Farmsteads**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Most Aurbez families live in **stand-alone stone farmsteads** or small clusters of 2–6 households linked by kinship. Houses are sturdy, one- or two-story stone buildings with thick walls, small windows, and steep roofs to shed snow. Families are largely self-sufficient, producing their own food, tools, and clothing. Social life is tied to seasonal gatherings and fairs rather than to daily village interaction.

---

**Historical Parallels:**

- **Scottish Fermtouns**  
    In the Scottish Highlands, _fermtouns_ were small clusters of 3–8 related households surrounded by shared fields. The land was worked communally under the direction of the kin group’s head, but each family kept its own animals and house. Houses were usually single-room stone or turf structures with thatched roofs, designed to keep warmth in during harsh winters.
    
- **Basque Baserriak**  
    A _baserri_ was a stand-alone farmhouse, often with attached barns and storage, designed to last generations. Ownership typically passed intact to a single heir to prevent land fragmentation, keeping the economic unit viable. Isolated in mountainous terrain, baserriak maintained close kinship ties with nearby farms for labor exchange and defense, but daily life was self-contained.

## **4. Fortified Waystations**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Strategic points along the road below the plateau — and at key plateau access points — are guarded by **fortified waystations**. These serve as both rest stops for traders and rally points in times of danger. Built of stone with stout gates, they have storehouses for supplies and small garrisons drawn from nearby communities. In peacetime, they act as neutral hubs for trade and news; in wartime, they become defensive linchpins.

---

**Historical Parallels:**

- **American Stage Stops & Fortified Ranches**  
    In the 19th-century American West, stagecoach routes were dotted with fortified stops that provided fresh horses, meals, and lodging. Some were simple roadhouses; others, especially in dangerous territory, were stockaded with firing loops and a well inside the walls. Many doubled as local gathering points where news was exchanged, deals struck, and travelers could hire escorts for dangerous stretches.
    
- **Camino Real Presidios (Spanish Colonies)**  
    Along frontier roads in New Spain, _presidios_ (military forts) served as waypoints to secure trade and communications. These were manned by soldiers and sometimes accompanied by small civilian settlements. Presidios also acted as supply depots, distributing goods to nearby ranches in return for livestock and provisions.
    

---

## **5. Economy**

**Aurbez Version:**  
Aurbez’s economy is **mixed subsistence with specialized exports**. Herding (goats, sheep), dairy products (notably hard cheese), and hardy grains are staples. Small-scale mining camps work copper, iron, and occasional silver seams, with miners moving between camps seasonally. Surplus goods are sold to traders on the road below the plateau or at seasonal fairs like those at _Three Wells_. Household craft production — woven cloaks, leather goods, carved wood — supplements incomes.

---

**Historical Parallels:**

- **Basque Pastoralism & Crafts**  
    Basque communities balanced herding with cultivation of hardy grains and legumes. Sheep and goat milk were turned into cheeses for storage and trade, while wool was spun into cloth for domestic use and sale. Many households specialized in crafts like ironwork (especially in mining districts), and exported tools, weapons, and household goods to lowland markets.
    
- **Western Mining Camps**  
    In the American West, mining camps ranged from temporary tent cities to substantial towns with saloons, general stores, and blacksmiths. Economic booms followed strikes in gold, silver, or copper, drawing seasonal or itinerant workers. When deposits were exhausted, camps often emptied within weeks, leaving ghost towns or repurposed settlements.

The below is a start, but needs collation with a bunch of discussions on discord, in email, etc as part of the planning around both [[Isingue]] and my Ausson's mini series
#### The Refounded Alliance of Aurbez

- Founded by two groups -- a core of refugees from the collapse of Insingue who hid out in the hills during the blood years, and developed a bit of a guerilla culture also supported the rangers a fair bit, second a group of folks who settled in Maseau or even the western marches for a bit, but were attracted by the growing rumors of an Insinguen  culture / group
    
- These people explicitly call back to Insingue as kinda their founding ideal / lost homeland
    
- Welcoming to travelers but very protective of their prerogative to the land, conceptually believe they have a claim to any habitable parts of the plaguelands, fiercely independent
    
- Rebuilding not foreign affairs is real goal, but claims to be the heirs of Insignue and claims sovereignty over all the lands south of Maseau and north of Insingue
    
- Major settlements are along the Aursen, along the Dunmar Road, in the foothills and valleys of the Douren, and in the high elevations from the source of the Aursen to the source of the Mansance

Some notes from the player introduction to the Aussons Mini Series. Does not have to be 100% canonical. This is also supposed to be from the 1680s perspective:

**Climate**

The area is dominated by a large mountain chain to the west and the Plaguelands to the east. It is a marginal land, with hot, dry summers when the ash-wind blows from the east and cold, dry winters when the westerlies blow over the mountains. The main rainfall is in the spring, when in lucky years several soaking rains will replenish the land, and in the summer when the punishing thunderstorms race from the east, bringing flash floods, lightning, and hail. In autumn the rivers shrink, and the temperature is briefly moderate before the cooler winters come.  

The flora and fauna is reminiscent of central Spain or highland Mexico - some elk and bison in the higher regions, pines and sequoias and similar trees, but definitely not a lush New England forest.
  

**People**

The main inhabitants are the Aurbeze (aur-bez-e), named after the Aurbez plateau which rises just to the west of the Last Inn. These people are mostly refugees from the Istabor River valley (which used to be a great fertile river delta until a magical red mist spread over the land and killed everyone who didn't manage to flee. Now it is a dry dusty wasteland with no people but plenty of scary things).
 
They have built small settler communities and fortified ranch houses (think Mexican hacienda complexes) and have started to try to eke a living out of the land, mostly herding goats, some hunting, and a little bit of small-scale farming and fishing nearer the rivers.

They also have a decent amount of trade with Sembara driven by explorers and miners who pick through the dwarven ruins for easily accessible metals and ores and ship them north.
 
 The main controversy in this community is about their identity: are they the descendants of Insingue (the largest city in the Istabor valley), destined to reclaim their lost greatness? Or are they smallholders, farmers, and herders, just looking to their children and grandchildren's future, making whatever decisions seem best to ensure a peaceful future? Should they be a great power, or a backwater?

  
**History**

After Great War this particular region was barren for a couple of years, and as the dwarves fled south in those early years the region would have been awash in chaos. Black storms of unnatural ash falling on the ground for weeks. Hobgoblin armies passing through, fleeing who knows what. Dark things emerging from the old dwarven mines. But in this time a small trickle of humans started fortifying caves up in the mountains, or building small highly fortified villages. They drifted in from the Istabor valley, for the most part, all with various tales about the terrors they fled or faced escaping and finding their way across a wasteland. Some also came in from the south, where the cataclysm of the end of the war had reshaped the very earth, raising a new set of mountains. 

But for maybe a generation of humans, these refugees stayed hidden, as did you -- the land was dangerous. But as time passed, and the human kingdoms established themselves, and the plague winds shrunk to mere normal ash, the region started to grow a bit. The original refugees had children, as humans are wont to do, and the land, if not bountiful, was at least empty.

  
The real change has happened in the last 50 years though. Queen Cece of Sembara ushered in an age of peace and prosperity. She built a road through the region, and more settlers started drifting in: not just people with ancient connections to the Istabor valley, who heard rumors of their culture being preserved here, but also anyone looking for a new start, some free land, etc.

This time is when the Inn was founded, the mining and metal trade started, and the political controversies above started.
