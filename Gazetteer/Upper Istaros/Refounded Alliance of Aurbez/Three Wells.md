Three Wells is a meeting place and fortified camp on the [[Aurbez Plateau]], along a small tributary of the [[Aursen]]. For many years, Three Wells has been a place where the people of the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] meet to debate politics and war. 

At the valleyâ€™s heart sit three old stone wells in a tight triangle; between them, a pillar holds a communal bowl of clear water and a ladle. Above the valley, a watchtower is maintained by [[The Rangers]]

Three Wells gets its name, and significance, from the [[Three Kin's War]], when lizardfolk, human, and stoneborn fought together against hobgoblin invaders and worse. The three wells honor each of the three kin who fought in the war.
