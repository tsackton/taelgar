Aursenbourg is a walled market town where the [[Maseau - Dunmar Road]] crosses the [[Aursen]], centered on a sturdy stone bridge built over the river in DR 1732. Now a major market town for the region, a generation ago this was only a small village known as Aursen's Crossing, where regular ferry service would shuttle caravans and traders over the Aursen.
