The Upper Istaros is a land of mystery and danger, settled only at its fringes, dominated by the desolation of the [[Plaguelands]]. Halflings find welcome along the [[Maseau - Dunmar Road]]: the fortified ranches in the [[March of Andonne]] have grown into villages, and the hearty people of the [[Aurbez Plateau]] welcome trade and tales. Many of these tales are of the terrors of the [[Plaguelands]]: the vast ash storms that sweep across the March in the summer; the strange abominations that creep up the [[Andonne]] from the haunted ruins of [[Isingue]]; the deceptive lushness of the Istaros river valley and the cursed fruit that grows from the trees that linger there. But other tales speak of the elves of [[Orenlas]], on the far side of the [[Plaguelands]], who keep alive the last remnants of the first forests of the world that still contain echoes of the first songs of the [[First Ones]]. Though these days few travelers linger here, fearing the ever-present dangers of the Plaguelands, the tales of those who fled the destruction of [[Isingue]] during the [[Great War]] remind travelers of a time when the Upper Istaros was a fertile crossroads, dotted with pleasant rolling hills and rich agricultural lands.

## Topography and Major Features
_See more: [[Istaros Watershed]]_

The Upper Istaros is defined by its rivers. This region contains [[Lake Aeulian]], the headwaters of the [[Istaros]], as well the river systems that feed it: the [[Aursen]], [[Douren]], [[Andonne]] , and [[Kulthul]] from the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]; the [[Valmont]] and its tributaries; the [[~Orenlas Tributary~]] watershed, and the [[~Southern Plaguelands Tributary~]] watershed. 

%%SECRET[1]%%
In the northwest, the land is flat along the [[Andonne Plain]], although now much of the former ranchlands and wheatfields are turned to dust and ash. The Andonne Plain ends abruptly at the [[Westcliff]], the western edge of the [[Mostreve Hills]].

## DM Notes and Meta
_See also: {links to lists, e.g. Places in Region}_

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city. [[Orenlas]] is an important and canonical elven realm. The [[Istaros]] itself has some detailed development. The orcs of [[Xurkhaz]] have a detailed culture and history. The region known as the [[Plaguelands]] is canonically dangerous and unsettled, but relatively undeveloped. The [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] and the [[March of Andonne]] were developed up to the 1680s, but less so beyond. The general climate and geography of the [[Aurbez and the Andonne]] is reasonably well developed. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* [[Isingue]] has significant brainstorming around its history, but little has been canonically committed, other than the fact that in late DR 1748 it is occupied by some kind of massive ooze creature. 

*Needs Development:* The current (DR 1700s) history and politics of the [[Aurbez and the Andonne]] would be valuable. Some details of the history of the orcs of [[Xurkhaz]] are unclear and could use development, as could some details of the country beyond the capital city of [[Uzgukhar]]. [[Erelion]], the largest city in [[Orenlas]], is well developed, but the rest of the realm is mostly a blank slate. 

*Intentionally Blank:* The current state of the [[Plaguelands]] is intentionally not well developed; any development should keep in mind that [[Isingue]] is likely central to an upcoming arc of the Dunmar Fellowship campaign. 

*Adventures:* A significant Dunmar Fellowship arc was set in [[Xurkhaz]], and the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] flew over [[Isingue]] in [[Vindristjarna]]. The Ausson's Crossing mini-campaign was set in this area, in the DR 1680s.

*Important Places in Staging:* None, although some secondary rivers need names eventually.
