*Canonical Development and Constraints:* [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city. [[Orenlas]] is an important and canonical elven realm. The [[Istaros]] itself has some detailed development. The orcs of [[Xurkhaz]] have a detailed culture and history. The region known as the [[Plaguelands]] is canonically dangerous and unsettled, but relatively undeveloped. The [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] and the [[March of Andonne]] were developed up to the 1680s, but less so beyond. The general climate and geography of the [[Aurbez and the Andonne]] is reasonably well developed. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* [[Isingue]] has significant brainstorming around its history, but little has been canonically committed, other than the fact that in late DR 1748 it is occupied by some kind of massive ooze creature. 

*Needs Development:* The current (DR 1700s) history and politics of the [[Aurbez and the Andonne]] would be valuable. Some details of the history of the orcs of [[Xurkhaz]] are unclear and could use development, as could some details of the country beyond the capital city of [[Uzgukhar]]. [[Erelion]], the largest city in [[Orenlas]], is well developed, but the rest of the realm is mostly a blank slate. 

*Intentionally Blank:* The current state of the [[Plaguelands]] is intentionally not well developed; any development should keep in mind that [[Isingue]] is likely central to an upcoming arc of the Dunmar Fellowship campaign. 

*Adventures:* A significant Dunmar Fellowship arc was set in [[Xurkhaz]], and the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] flew over [[Isingue]] in [[Vindristjarna]]. The Ausson's Crossing mini-campaign was set in this area, in the DR 1680s.

*Important Places in Staging:* None, although some secondary rivers need names eventually.
