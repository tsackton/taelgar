## 10. Istabor and South Cymea

*Area:* This includes the northern part of the [[Istaros Watershed]] starting southeast of [[Aurbez Plateau]] and related areas, and stretches to the coast of the Green Sea. It is bordered by the [[Mostreve Hills]], the [[Darkwood]], [[Orenlas]], and the [[~Cymea Border Mountains~]] to the north, and [[Xurkhaz]] to the south. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city, and this region is canonically now mostly known as the [[Plaguelands]] and is dangerous and unsettled. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* Isingue has significant brainstorming around its history, but little has been canonically committed. [[~South Cymea~]] was canonically a Drankorian province. 

*Blank Regions:* Although [[Isingue]] is an important canonical city, with numerous brainstorming notes about its history, very little has been canonically committed. Other than being Drankorian, [[~South Cymea~]] is a complete blank. The current state of the [[Plaguelands]] is intentionally not well developed, but [[~South Cymea~]] is not intentionally mysterious.

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region, although the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] flew over [[Isingue]] in [[Vindristjarna]]. Any development should keep in mind that [[Isingue]] is likely central to an upcoming arc of the Dunmar Fellowship campaign.
