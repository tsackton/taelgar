- To the north, this region is bordered by the northern edge of the [[~Great Desert~]].
- To the east, this region is bordered by the [[~Eastern Ocean~]].
- To the west, this region is bordered by the eastern edge of the [[Sea of Storms]] and the hills and badlands that mark the eastern edge of the [[Istaros Watershed]]
