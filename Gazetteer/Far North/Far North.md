%% this is a potential refactor of regional pages; questioning whether it is sensible? %%

Far north, beyond the northern lands of [[Vostok]] and [[Ursk]] lies a mysterious land of long winters and bitter cold. Rarely visited, even rumors from this region rarely reach the populated lands of the south. The stories that do reach the south tell of frost-breathing dragons, obsidian statues as tall as the hills, and singing caves of ice that devour unwary travelers. More prosaic stories of wooly mammoths with heavy ivory tusks and short summers filled with rushing snowmelt and clouds of gnats as far as the eye can see have also come south. Who is to say which stories are true?

## Major Features
Few have mapped this region, but some major features are known, if not named:

* [[~Far North Central River~]] : a river system that drains from the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] north to the ice-choked [[~Far North Bay~]]
* [[~Far North Western Mountains~]]: a range of coastal mountains, impassible and choked with snow and ice
* [[~Far North Sentinels~]]: north of the northern-most [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] 
* [[~NorthUrskMountains~]]: said to be the birthplace of [[Vimfrost]] and home to main frost-breathing dragons
* [[~North Ursk River~]]:  
* [[~Northern Boreal Forest~]]: 

%% This section probably lists too many 'potential' places, it is not clear the best way to manage a 'major features' section here. Should it only include named or should-be-named features? Should the map have more stuff blanked out? %%'
## Civilizations and Cultures
Although rumors persist of [[Kenku|kenku]] flying across the [[~Far North Steppe~]], few can say where exactly these winged creatures live. 
## Climate
This region of Taelgar is nearly entirely within the subpolar or polar climates, a mix of [vast subarctic forests](https://geodiode.com/climate/subarctic) and [barren tundra](https://geodiode.com/climate/tundra). But few rumors or tales come to the south from these regions, and in the distant north, who knows what strange magic may sustain life in unlikely places?

#### Area and Borders
This region is poorly defined as little geographic development exists, but it includes everything north of [[Pandar]], [[Vostok]], and the [[Ket]]. West of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] and east of [[Ursk]] there is insufficient development to define a precise border, but in general it should be north of any significant settled human cultures.
#### Canonical Development and Constraints
This region, particular the mountains north of [[Ursk]], are home to many white dragons, including the descendants of [[Vimfrost]], which has significant influences both on this area and regions to the south. A large number of [[kenku]] canonically make their home on the central plains of this region, on the eastern slopes the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]] north of [[Zimka]] but few details have been developed. 
#### Non-Canonical Development
The area north of [[Vostok]] is tentatively invented as a subarctic grassland - like the interior Canadian plains / northern Great Plains - large mammals, cold winters, mammoths - and tentatively assumed to be a place where kenku settled after escaping from Pandar. However, details are vague, at best, and the geography / climate is not set in stone. 
#### Blank Regions
This area is almost entirely undeveloped, and is largely intentionally blank. Any human civilizations here would be highly magic or scattered and small, and not likely to impact other cultures or the grand sweep of history. 
#### Adventures
No adventures have been set in this region.
