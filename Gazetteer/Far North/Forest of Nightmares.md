A cursed forest, once home to many [[Deno'qai]]. The scene of many battles during the [[Great War]], and now haunted by the dead. Not a safe place to travel, for the restless dead swarm the living who enter the forest and remain still for more than a few hours. 

On the western border of the territory of the [[Ko'zula]] [[Deno'qai]] tribe.
