# The Bandit's Way
>[!info]+ Information
> A section of the [[Great South Road]]

Bandit's Way is the name for the stretch of the [[Great South Road]] that passes between [[Evis]] and [[Cleenseau]] through a hundred miles of rocky shrubland. The road used to be dotted with inns and waystations, but these have fallen into disrepair since the Great War. This stretch of road is often called Banditâ€™s Way, and many ex-soliders make a living escorting caravans between [[Cleenseau]] and [[Evis]], the northernmost settlement in [[Duchy of Maseau|Maseau]] along the Great South Road.
