> A  hamlet in [[Cleenseau]], the [[Barony of Aveil]], [[Sembara]], the [[Western Green Sea Region]]

A small hamlet in the [[Cleenseau Region]] of about a dozen farms, on the edge of the [[Cleenseau Wood]], a mile and a half north of [[Cleenseau]] along a dirt track. The small hamlet is mostly woodcutters, charcoal makers, and pig farmers and is part of the manor of the Lord of Clenseau. It consists of about a dozen buildings, only one of which is notable: a large, two story stone building with three large oak trees carved on the lintel. It is said this was once holy to a *[[kestavo]]* of the wood, who has long since departed.
