# The River’s Blessing
>[!info]+ Information
> An  inn in [[Cleenseau]], the [[Barony of Aveil]], [[Sembara]], the [[Western Green Sea Region]]

A quiet place known for its fried trout. This inn is where the villagers from the east often stay when bringing goods to market. It has a insular and local vibe, and although strangers are not unwelcome exactly, many prefer to stay at the [[The Fox’s Flagon]] or [[The Crossroads Inn]].
