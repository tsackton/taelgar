# The Fox’s Flagon
>[!info]+ Information
> An  inn in [[Cleenseau]], the [[Barony of Aveil]], [[Sembara]], the [[Western Green Sea Region]]

 A three story inn popular with traders and merchants, but often quiet when no caravan is in town. Known for neither its food (go to [[The River’s Blessing]] for that), or drink ([[The Bandit’s End]] is recommended), it is nonetheless a comfortable, secure, and dry place to sleep, and it has a large innyard and stables for travelers horses.
