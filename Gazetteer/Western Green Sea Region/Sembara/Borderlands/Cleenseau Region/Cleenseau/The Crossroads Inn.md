A large inn in [[Cleenseau]], said to be hundreds of years old, kept by the Stonebridge family of halflings for generations. Most of the rooms are designed for halflings, but it has a small number of comfortable, if cozy, rooms for humans, and the common room is often full of townsfolk at night hearing the latest news from out of town and drinking down pints of the famous millet ale.

It is a welcoming and homey place, although not as cheap as the three inns ([[The Bandit’s End]], [[The River’s Blessing]], or [[The Fox’s Flagon]]) that are outside the walls.

[[Marigold Stonebridge]] claims the inn was built in 1392 on ancient land deeded to the Stonebridge family based on ancient family right. It was, she says, a center of resistance to [[Avatus|Avatus's]] hobgoblin's during their occupation of Cleenseau in the 1420s, and there was an underground tunnel, or tunnels, for smuggling humans out of Cleenseau.

Later, during the [[Third Hobgoblin War (Sembara)|Third Hobgoblin War]] a small number of Stonebridges, including Marigold, were kept alive by the hobgoblin leadership apparently to cook and maintain the inn for them.
