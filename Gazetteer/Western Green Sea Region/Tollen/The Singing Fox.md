# The Singing Fox
>[!info]+ Information
> A [[Halflings|halfling]] inn in [[Fairgate Outer]], the [[Tollen|Free City of Tollen]], the [[Western Green Sea Region]]

A cozy halfling tavern in Fairgate Outer, run by [[Chenna Goodbarrel]] and her wife [[Harriet Goodbarrel|Harriet]]. Harriet is a decent singer and The Singing Fox gets a decent crowd (mostly locals and passing halflings) when she is performing.
