Antaka is a small island dominated by a massive volcano. There are four small villages here, which together make a single district of only 6 oskunja. 

Three of the villages are nestled by the ocean near small harbors, and are largely fishing villages. The fourth is associated with the volcanic sacred site.

[[Skalme]] is the priest of the temple to [[Kaikkea]] at the volcanic site.
