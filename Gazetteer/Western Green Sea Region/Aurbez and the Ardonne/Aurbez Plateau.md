# The Aurbez Plateau
>[!info]+ Information
> A region in the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]]

The Aurbez Plateau rises sharply just north and west of the Dunmar Road, and is several thousand feet higher than the rest of the region. This is the heart of the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]]. The biggest settlements are around the marshy upper [[Aursen]] before it spills off the plateau in a series of waterfalls just before the road crossing, although most of the people are tucked away in the mountains, especially the southern stretches.
