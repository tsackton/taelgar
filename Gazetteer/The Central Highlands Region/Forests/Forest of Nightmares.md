## Forest of Nightmares

A cursed forest, once home to many Deno'qai. The scene of many battles during the [[Great War]], and now haunted by the dead. Not a safe place to travel for the restless dead swarm the living who enter the forest and remain still for more than a few hours. 

On the western border of the territory of the [[Ko'zula]] Deno'qai tribe.
