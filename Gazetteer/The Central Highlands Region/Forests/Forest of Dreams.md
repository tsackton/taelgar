Part of the great forest once known as [[Ainumarya]], now a mysterious place where few humans travel. Rumored to be where many surviving [[Elves|elves]] live. North of the [[Crimson Forest]] and the [[Elderwood]]. Its northernmost reaches are now known as the [[Forest of Nightmares]] due to the corrupting influence of the [[Events/1500s/Great War]].
