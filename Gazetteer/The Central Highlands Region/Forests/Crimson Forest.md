# The Crimson Forest

A mostly-uninhabited forest, stretching from Lake Valandros in the west to the [[Sentinel Range]] in the east, and between the [[Elderwood]] to the south and the [[Forest of Dreams]] to the north. 

Once part of the vast unbroken forest known as [[Ainumarya]], the Crimson Forest was the site of some of the most intense fighting during the [[Events/1500s/Great War]] and especially during the [[Blood Years]] that followed. 

Named after the rumors that the trees ran red with the blood of the elves and their allies in the [[Events/1500s/Great War]].
