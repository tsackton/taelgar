# Nidzahar

One of the [[Dwarven Kingdoms]] of the [[Sentinel Range]], 

Historically, Nidzahar, was a backwater, a minor kingdom of not much importance, which is even reflected in its name, which loosely translates simply as ‘east-land’. Nestled along the easternmost edge of the mountains and spreading into the lightly settled highlands of [[Sembara]], the Kingdom of Nidzahar was never particularly populous or prosperous. Lacking the mineral wealth of [[Am'khazar]] and the trade connections of [[Ardith]] or [[Khatridun]], before the war the kingdom of Nidzahar was of little importance, known largely as a place of iconoclasts, thinkers, and artisans. 

After the [[Events/1500s/Great War]], the center of dwarven wealth and civilization in [[Khatridun]] and [[Ardith]] fell, and Nidzahar attracted most of the trade with [[Sembara]] that remained, turning the raw mineral wealth of [[Am'khazar]] to the west into armor, weapons, and stranger innovations. Now, Nidzahar is the largest and most technologically advanced of the five kingdoms.
