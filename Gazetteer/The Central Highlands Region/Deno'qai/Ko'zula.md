## Ko'zula

A Deno'qai tribe living in the far north, in the lower elevations of the mountains. 

### History

The northern forests, north of the Blackwater Fens and inland from the coast, were once home to many Deno'qai, before [[Cha'mutte]] established himself in Pandar. This area, a vast forest stretching from the sea to the mountains, was north of the elven territories, and the Deno'qai who settled here were fierce, independent, less influenced by the Elven ways, living more openly in small towns and villages.

#### The Great War

After [[Cha'mutte]] established himself in Pandar, the [[K'eye]] river became the de facto border of Deno'qai territory, and for several hundred years minor skirmishes were frequently fought across the river border, and the larger Deno'qai settlements retreated towards the hills and mountains.

In DR 1536, [[Cha'mutte]] launched his assault. Keeping dragons in reserve, an army of hobgoblins quickly established control over the ~200 miles of forest between the [[K'eye]] and Pandar, clearing the forests and using the timber for massive war machines.

Six years later, in DR 1541, the first campaign of the [[Great War]] was launched across the [[K'eye]]. The Deno'qai fought a hopeless rearguard action, trying to keep the enemies at bay for as long as possible, with some minor successes until [[Cha'mutte]] begins calling in extraplanar forces, hobgoblin mages who can control the magic of the [[Shadowfell]], and great demons from the [[Abyss]] and from [[Pandemonium]].

By the bitter winter of 1541-1542, the Deno'qai were nearly wiped out, despite the heroics of warriors like [[Balati]]. Those who survive -- largely members of the [[Shu'anra]] and Ko'zula tribes -- flee into the mountains, abandoning the [[Forest of Dreams]] below to the chaos [[Cha'mutte]] brings.

As [[Cha'mutte]]'s army proceeds south, into elven lands and the southern Deno'qai, the surviving [[Shu'anra]] and Ko'zula people are cut off, isolated without help or hope. Many die of exposure and starvation in the difficult years that follow, and many who survive are saved only by the aid of the Stoneborn and the Dwarves.

#### Recontact

It is not until the 1640s that the isolated northern Deno'qai tribes begin to slowly, cautiously leave their mountain redoubts. The forests north of the Blackwater Fens are deeply changed, cursed and corrupted by [[Cha'mutte]]'s armies, the demons of his horde, and none can live there. The elves are now gone, or hidden, and the Deno'qai cannot find them again. Loose trade connections to the Deno'qai living to the southeast of the Blackwater Fens are established, but these are tenuous, at best. Whatever people survive along the coast are far away, isolated by the fens themselves and the corruption of the forests south of Pandar.

Still, slowly connections grow, and over time more rumors come to the [[Shu'anra]] and [[Ko'zula]] tribes, of safer places to the south, warmer and easier to live, further from the haunted reminders of [[Cha'mutte]]'s wars. Some flee, but many stay.

#### The Quiet Years

In the past four generations, the tribes have grown in relative safety. The [[Shu'anra]] have drifted south, living mostly to the east of the Blackwater Fens, in the low passes of the mountains, trading with dwarves, kenku, and stoneborn. The [[Ko'zula]] have kept the the peaks and icy pine forests on the high slopes. Both tribes have prospered to a certain extent, and no major wars or catastrophes have struck.

### Customs

The northern Deno'qai, while worshipping tanshi like their southern brethren, and descended from the same original settlers, are culturally distinct to a certain extent.

They wear heavy furs, and lamellar armor (scale mail), and fight with axes. Little farming would normally be possible in the high mountains, but the Ko'zula have learned some of the terraced farming tricks of the stoneborn, and grow hearty crops in the long days of the short summers.

The culture depends far more on hunting than the southern Deno'qai, and mammoth hunts are major events that can feed a village for a long time. For hunting, they use long barbed javelins and bows.

Share more in common with Stoneborn really than with elves up here. Very strong individualistic streak, but also the idea that you do what is good for the community or you leave.

Each village sends a representative to the yearly gathering of the tribe, to negotiate among villages and otherwise keep the peace, etc.

Tradition of marriage outside your village, but no formalized rules for which partner moves - but this keeps connections among what would otherwise be largely isolated small villages. Villages each need a lot of territory as they depend on the hunt. Manage game populations for productivity, ride reindeer not horses (and sometimes giant mountain goats).
