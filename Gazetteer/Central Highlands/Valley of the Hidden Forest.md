The Valley of the Hidden Forest is a rumored hidden valley in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], which may or may not exist. 

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
The Valley of the Hidden Forest, called *Naun Tarvanos* in Elvish, was a pre-Great-War refuge, part of the legend of [[Rai]] and rumored to be a place where [[Rai]] trained. The name [[Session 113 (DuFr)|was heard]] by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] in a vision of [[Rai]], and his familiar [[Dimitaur]] associated it with a distant place where [[Rai]] trained and learned.
