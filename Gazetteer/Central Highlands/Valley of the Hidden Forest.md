# The Valley of the Hidden Forest

The Valley of the Hidden Forest is a secluded valley in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]].

Elven sources preserve the name *Naun Tarvanos*, “Valley of the Hidden Forest”. In at least one modern account, the elf [[Rai]] spoke the name while weaving powerful concealment magic, and his familiar [[Dimitaur]] associated it with a distant place Rai once visited.

%% AI note: The vault currently contains only a few references to this place; details beyond its name and association with Rai/Dimitaur are not yet recorded. %%
