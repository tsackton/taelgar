Nidzahar, loosely 'east-land', is one of the five [[Dwarven Kingdoms]] of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]]. It is located predominately on the eastern side of the mountains, loosely bordered by [[Fahnukan]] to the north, [[Am'khazar]] to the west, [[Zimkova]] to the east, and [[Khatridun]] to the south. Nidzahar is the largest in area of the [[Dwarven Kingdoms]], but is primarily settled along its eastern border. 
## History

Although Nidzahar's history, like all the kingdoms of [[Sentinel Range|Labkhan]], stretches far back to the very beginnings of time, long before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], for much of its existence it was something of a backwater, a minor kingdom, neither populous or prosperous. Lacking the mineral wealth of [[Am'khazar]] to the southwest, and the trade connections of [[Ardith]] or [[Khatridun]] to the south, Nidzahar was historically known primarily as a place of iconoclasts, thinkers, and artisans. 

After the [[Great War]], the center of dwarven wealth and civilization in [[Khatridun]] and [[Ardith]] fell, and Nidzahar attracted most of the trade with [[Sembara]] and [[Zimkova]] that remained, turning the raw mineral wealth of [[Am'khazar]] to the west into armor, weapons, and stranger innovations. Now, Nidzahar is the largest and most technologically advanced of the five kingdoms.

## Culture and Economy

Nidzahar has long been a place that attracted tinkerers, technologists, artificers, and others seeking to push the foundations of dwarven skill and knowledge. Although not a place of fabulous mineral wealth, like [[Am'khazar]], in recent years Nidzahar has become something of the workshop of the [[Dwarven Kingdoms]], and has rapidly filled the economic vacuum left by the collapse of [[Ardith]] and destruction of parts of [[Khatridun]] at the end of the [[Great War]]. 

%% Some flavor notes from [[Izgil Moonseeker|Izgil's]] background:
I actually think that astronomy would not be that strange/foreign to the dwarves, especially in Nidzahar, which is the most "tech oriented" of all the dwarven kingdoms in the central mountains (still need a name....). Construction of lens, for example, would fit well and telescopes/star gazing works well with mountain-tops too.

One general comment. Since your game is set around 1650, a dwarf who is 200 years old would have been born before the Great War, and would have been around 100 during the Great War. This was a massive upheaval for the dwarves of the central mountains - Khatridun and Ardith suffered the most, with Ardith entirely destroyed and Khatridun reduced by more than half due to the destruction around Ulrich monastery and the passes. Nidzahar was kind of a backwater before the Great War, or at least substantially overshadowed by the much richer Khatridun which profited greatly on the Chardon/Sembara trade. But after the Great War many refugees settled in Nidzahar and much of the pre-Great War Sembaran trade shifted here, especially the dwarf/human trade (in the current age, dwarves would be less intermediaries and more selling their own wares), and as part of this influence of prosperity and people Nidzahar experienced a bit of a tecnhological boom. I kind of imagine this kind of like post-world-war-2 America, especially in the sense that Nidzahar survives the war basically without ever facing combat on its soil and without any magical disruption. This could, of course, just be going on in the background and not directly related to your player's backstory, but worth being aware of. 

  A minor additional comment - I think telescope would be known fairly widely in Nidzahar. Still of course totally reasonable to be seeking a master crafter in Clenseau known for particularly good ones, but I think it would be a little strange for a dwarf from Nidzahar, especially one fascinated by the moon, not to be familiar with telescopes.
