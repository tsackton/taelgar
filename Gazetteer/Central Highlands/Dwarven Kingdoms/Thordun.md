Thordûn (the Western Door), is the largest and most elaborate of the western gates to to the dwarven kingdom of [[Am'khazar]], though not the most frequently used. It is located on the edge of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], north of the [[Crimson Forest]], in the [[Highveil Forest]].

GL Arc 3: [[Great Library Session Notes - Arc 3]]

This is a little too far north to be a major trading point in the modern day, but pre-Great-War this would have been a center of elvish/dwarven exchange. 

The vibe is kind of ancient grandeur slightly falling into decay, as traffic shifts south to connect to [[Arendum]].
