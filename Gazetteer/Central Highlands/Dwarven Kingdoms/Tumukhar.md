Tumukhar was a southern hold of [[Am'khazar]], lying down‑valley from [[Zarkandur]], and severing as a high mountain entrance to the underground routes and roads in [[Am'khazar]]. Before its abandonment, Tumukhar served as a way‑city for travelers and traders bound toward the Stoneborn villages and other destinations in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], with stout gateworks, tiered streets, and well‑kept cisterns fed by mountain rills. Its craftsmen were known for practical ironwork and serviceable tools destined for the frontier, and for the quiet hospitality expected of a road city: a warm seat by the brazier, a pot on the hearth, and news from the passes.

During the Long Winter, cold unlike any living dwarf recalled swept down from the heights. Tumukhar’s fountains glazed over; ice traced the carvings on lintels and doors; and frost‑spirits slipped through shuttered alleys. With the lower wards glazed and patrols reporting mephits and worse in the streets, the elders ordered an orderly withdrawal toward Zarkandur and the deeper halls of Am’khazar. By the time the exodus was complete, the outer gates stood silent beneath wind‑packed snow and the city lay in uneasy stillness.

Since the thaw’s beginning, plans for Tumukhar’s renewal have begun to be developed. As of DR 1748 settlers have not returned to the city, but initial plans for reopening wayhouses and the gate, and staffing a garrison, are underway.

GL Arc 3 notes (campaign):

- The city was encountered frozen and abandoned (DR 1747‑12‑13), with ice mephits, snow golems, and an ice troll reported within the wards. The party traversed Tumukhar en route to Stoneborn villages and the source of the freezing in the high peaks, and narrowly avoided an avalanche trap at the mountain exit.
- Session references: GL Arc 3 notes for 1747‑12‑13 and follow‑on sessions; background indicates a glacier around the frost‑giant stronghold of [[Vangebekkr]] as the proximate source of the unnatural cold.
