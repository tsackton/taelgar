Vangebekkr is an old frost giant castle in the high peaks of the [[Sentinel Range]]. 

%%^Campaign:GL%%
In DR 1747, it was occupied by the frost hag [[Morgana Stoneclaw|Morgana Frostclaw]], and many of the frost giant inhabitants were turned to her evil ways. Upon her destruction by the [[Silver Tempests]], the castle was left under the control of several frost giant prisoners rescued from her dungeons.

GL Arc 3: assault on the castle; freed giants retook the halls while the party pursued the hag below.

No real history developed. In the Great Library arc, a hag had corrupted the majority of the frost giants, but some remained imprisoned, who were free by the party. More details in:
