# The Crimson Forest

A mostly-uninhabited forest, stretching from [[Lake Valandros]] in the west to the [[Sentinel Range]] in the east, and between the [[Elderwood]] to the south and the [[Forest of Dreams]] to the north. 

Once part of the vast unbroken forest known as [[Ainumarya]], the Crimson Forest was the site of some of the most intense fighting during the [[Great War]] and the battles that followed during the [[Conclave War]]. 

Named after the rumors that the trees ran red with the blood of the [[Elves]] and their allies in the fighting that took place here.
