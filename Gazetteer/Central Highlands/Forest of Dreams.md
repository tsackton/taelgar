A mysterious forest on the slopes of the [[Sentinel Range]], where few [[Humans]] travel, and a part of the great forest of [[Ainumarya]]. Rumored to be where many surviving [[Elves|elves]] live. The Forest of Dreams lies north of the [[Crimson Forest]] and the [[Elderwood]], and south of what is now the [[Forest of Nightmares]].
