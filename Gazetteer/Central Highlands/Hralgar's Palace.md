Hralgar's Palace is a ruined mountain palace in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], once belonging to the storm giant [[Hralgar]]. In the current day, the palace is abandoned, its halls broken and weather-worn. Travelers speak of strange, dreamlike hazards in its depths.

In DR 1748, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] [[Session 73 (DuFr)|ventured to the palace]] and recovered a [[Hralgar's Phasing Stone|phasing stone]] from Hralgar’s library—an artifact later used to restore the skyship [[Vindristjarna]]. They also recorded notes on ancient skyships and [[Hralgar's Palace Treasure|recovered]] several giant-sized books from the library.
