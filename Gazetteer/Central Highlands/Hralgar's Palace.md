# Hralgar's Palace

Hralgar's Palace is a ruined mountain palace in the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], once belonging to the storm giant [[Hralgar]].

## The Ruins

In the modern day the palace is abandoned, its halls broken and weather-worn. Travelers speak of strange, dreamlike hazards in its depths, and of a great library that does not always obey ordinary rules of space.

## Hralgar's Library

In DR 1748, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] ventured to the palace and recovered a [[Phasing Stones|phasing stone]] from Hralgar’s library—an artifact later used to restore the skyship [[Vindristjarna]]. They also recorded notes on ancient skyships and recovered several giant-sized books from the library.
