Urlich Pass is a high pass through the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]. Before the [[Great War]], it was an important crossing of the mountains, linking the western duchies of [[Sembara]] to the [[Chardon]] and the many diverse realms west of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]]. In DR 1545, the passes of Urlich were the site of the [[Battle of Urlich Pass]], the climactic battle of the [[Great War]], where [[Cha'mutte]] was defeated. In the aftermath, the pass and the surrounding highlands were left shattered and dangerous.

In the [[Feywild]], the region around Urlich Pass is echoed by [[Sharpspire]], a realm said to have fallen since the Great War and now described as a no-man’s-land.

The site of the final battle against Cha'mutte, the [[Battle of Urlich Pass]], which was the climatic event of the high school campaign. Canonically, that battle took place at Urlich Monastery, which was somehow associated with the dwarven firstborn or some way to make it easier for Cha'mutte to attack the firstborn. Likely this was a special kind of extraplanar weak spot, somehow connecting to the firstborn realms, and also the site of some kind of structure - perhaps a dwarven monastery, perhaps something else.
