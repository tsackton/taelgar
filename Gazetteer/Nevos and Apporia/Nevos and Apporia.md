The pirate realm of [[Illoria]] is the major culture of the [[Nevos Sea]], although since its conquest by the [[Chardonian Empire]] the southern (unconquered) islands have splinted somewhat. Historically, [[Castrella]] was a major realm in the region, although it has been part of the [[Chardonian Empire]] for over a hundred years now.

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The general vibes of Illoria are canonical. There is some significant post-Great War historical development, mostly concerning Dunmar and Apporia, that involves Illoria and needs to be considered in any future developments concerning Illoria. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* The exact cultural heritage of [[Illoria]] is unclear, as is its history during the [[Drankorian Era]].

*Needs Development:* Illoria itself lacks anything more than some basic vibes, and the Emerald Bay coast of the Apporian Peninsula, outside the terminus of the [[Old Chardon Canal]], is nearly entirely blank. The southern and eastern coasts of the Apporian Peninsula is plausibly either Illorian or something mysterious, but has not been canonically developed at all. The overall history of this region, at least outside the intentionally blank areas, could use development building on the existing fragments. 

*Intentionally Blank:* On the Apporia Peninsula, the interior and western coasts are intentionally left blank and mysterious

*Adventures:* Illoria has been at the edge of several Dunmari Frontier adventures, but only two sessions were actually set in the Nevos Sea, and primarily involved traveling to and then through the [[Old Chardon Canal]]. The merfolk arc of the Dunmari Frontier was partially set on the north coast of Apporia. 

*Important Places in Staging:* None.
