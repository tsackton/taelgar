# The Drowned Tower
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`  
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

An ancient, half‑submerged ruin on the [[Erbalta Plains]], noted for a persistent confluence with the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. The tower’s lower chambers are waterlogged throughout the year, with a central reservoir and flooded halls that have given the site its name. Scholars of the [[Great Library]] identify the Drowned Tower as a planar locus documented in the correspondence of [[Airion|Airion Mistspeaker]], who sought out places where the boundary between the Material and the Elemental planes is thin. The exact nature of the [[Planar Connections|planar connection]] here is unclear.

## Description

The surviving structure rises from low ground between waterways on the northern plains. The base and first levels are partially collapsed and inundated; higher rooms show traces of old wards and decayed fittings. A central fountain or well‑chamber forms the focus of the ruin and is believed to mark the core of the planar seepage.

## Location and Access

The Drowned Tower stands in the northern [[Erbalta Plains]], reachable from [[Voltara]] by several days’ travel across open grasslands. Approaches typically require fording or following river bends and must account for seasonal storms and flooding.

Campaign Notes (GL Arc 1)

- Archivist [[Lyra]] directed the expedition after letters from [[Pietravola Abbey]] indicated a water‑aligned planar locus. Travel from Voltara took roughly two days through orc‑patrolled grasslands, run as a skill‑challenge with hazards such as thunderstorms and flash flood.
- The tower was encountered as a “flooded, diseased” ruin with blights outside. Within, an awakened tree was aided, and a cursed water weird bound to a corrupted fountain was defeated. The party cleansed the water thereafter.
- The [[Deepwater Scroll]] was recovered from a hiding place anchored via an immovable rod to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] (DR 1747‑05‑05).
- Travel/framework details: journey skill challenge (navigation, scouting, lookout, trail‑finding, river crossing); consequences ranged from delays and exhaustion to orc encounters if failures mounted.

Exact nature of planar connection is not canonically determined, although the Silver Tempests did enter the Plane of Water from the tower.
