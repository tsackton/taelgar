# The Drowned Tower

A ruined, half‑flooded tower on the [[Erbalta Plains]] where the boundary to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] is thin. Site of the [[Deepwater Scroll]]’s recovery by the [[Silver Tempests]].

## Campaign Notes (GL Arc 1)

- Following letters recovered from [[Pietravola Abbey]], the party traveled two days north from [[Voltara]] through orc‑patrolled grasslands to reach the tower (skill‑challenge travel with hazards such as storms and floods).
- Within the tower the party fought blights, aided an awakened tree, and defeated a cursed water weird bound to a corrupted fountain. After cleansing the water, they recovered the scroll from its hiding place, anchored in the Plane of Water with an immovable rod (DR 1747‑05‑05).
