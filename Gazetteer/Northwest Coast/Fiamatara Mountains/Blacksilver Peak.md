Blacksilver Peak is a jagged mountain in the northern part of the [[Fiatara Mountains]], with a significant glacier covering the summit. A large complex of Dwarven ruins lie beneath the peak. 

%%^Campaign:none%%

Not canonically determined if the dwarven ruins in Blacksilver Peak connect to the dwarven ruins to the south, the [[Goldpeak Mines]]. The PCs never found a connection but doesn't mean one doesn't exist.
