# Blacksilver Peak

>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

A jagged, ice‑shrouded summit in the far north of the [[Fiamatara Mountains]], described as a “sharp, snow‑and‑ice covered knife edge, source of perpetual storms, even in summer.” Beneath the peak lies an [[Goldpeak Mines|ancient Dwarven road]] and an old complex leading to the so‑called Endless Stair through the heart of the mountain.

## Connections and Approach (GL Arc 1)

- Endless Stair — A long stair climbs within the mountain to the glaciers near the summit, ultimately providing access to [[Airion’s Tower|Airion’s floating tower]].
- Northern approach — The party located the peak by following hints from a seized map, then found the old Dwarven road with the help of a giant eagle eyrie after dealing with a frost giant and remorhaz on the slopes. They also fought basilisks and cleared a troll lair at the cave entrance before ascending the stair.
- Summit waystation — Near the glaciers, the party met [[Dinia]], who offered guidance to approach the tower in exchange for dealing with an abominable yeti.
