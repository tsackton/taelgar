# Blacksilver Peak

A jagged, ice‑shrouded summit in the far north of the [[Fiatara Mountains]]. Blacksilver Peak is a sharp, snow‑and‑ice covered knife edge, and source of perpetual storms, even in summer. Beneath the peak lies an ancient Dwarven road and an old complex leading to the so‑called "Endless Stair" through the heart of the mountain.

%% DM

Not canonically determined if the dwarven ruins in Blacksilver Peak connect to the dwarven ruins to the south, the [[Goldpeak Mines]]. The PCs never found a connection but doesn't mean one doesn't exist. 

## Connections and Approach (GL Arc 1)

- Endless Stair — A long stair climbs within the mountain to the glaciers near the summit, ultimately providing access to [[Airion’s Tower|Airion’s floating tower]].
- Northern approach — The party located the peak by following hints from a seized map, then found the old Dwarven road with the help of a giant eagle eyrie after dealing with a frost giant and remorhaz on the slopes. They also fought basilisks and cleared a troll lair at the cave entrance before ascending the stair.
- Summit waystation — Near the glaciers, the party met [[Dinia]], who offered guidance to approach the tower in exchange for dealing with an abominable yeti.
