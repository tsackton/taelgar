# The Fiamatara Mountains
>[!info]+ Information
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

The northern mountain range of the [[Northwest Coast]], tall enough for glaciers and marked by long winters and steep, rocky slopes. The range contains extensive pre‑Great War Dwarven works beneath the peaks, many abandoned and now claimed by monsters.

## Notable Peaks and Sites

- [[Goldpeak Mountain]] — One of the southernmost major peaks. The [[Deepriver Clan]] mines under Goldpeak include the kobold‑occupied “Forge of Fire” and deeper levels later claimed by the beholder [[Vilaxes]].
- [[Goldpeak Mines]] — An umbrella for the ancient Dwarven mine complexes and connected caverns under Goldpeak and nearby peaks.
- [[Blacksilver Peak]] — A northern summit lashed by constant storms. An old Dwarven road leads to a cave and the “Endless Stair,” which climbs through the mountain to the glaciers and access to [[Airion’s Tower]].
