# The Fiamatara Mountains
>[!info]+ Information
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

The principal northern range of the [[Northwest Coast]], marked by steep, rocky ridges, heavy snows, and glaciers on the highest summits. Beneath many of these peaks lie extensive pre‑Great War Dwarven excavations. These underways and vaults were widely abandoned during or after the [[Great War]], and many stand empty or have since been taken over by dangerous creatures.

## Geography

The mountains trend generally north–south, forming a barrier between coastal forests on the [[~North Bay~]] and the [[Erbalta Plains]]. Sharp peaks and knife‑edge ridges dominate the skyline in the north, with permanent ice at the highest elevations. Meltwaters and springs feed numerous headwaters that descend to the plains as braided streams and rivers.

## Notable Peaks and Sites

- [[Goldpeak Mountain]]: The southernmost major peak with extensive [[Deeprivers|Deepriver Clan]] workings beneath, forming the extensive linked shafts and deep caverns of the [[Goldpeak Mines]].
- [[Blacksilver Peak]]: A prominent summit in the northern part of the range, often wreathed in storms. Ancient Dwarven approaches lead to a cave system and the so‑called “Endless Stair” rising through the heart of the mountain; legends tie this route to access for [[Airion’s Tower]].

## Environment and Travel

Weather in the high country is severe, with sudden storms and treacherous footing at elevation. Lower approaches from the [[Erbalta Plains]] follow old Dwarven roads where they can be found; elsewhere, travel requires careful navigation along scree, snowfields, and precarious ledges.

Campaign Notes (GL)

- DR 1747‑04‑05: Recovery of the [[Flamekeeper Scroll]] from a kobold‑held “Forge of Fire” shrine within the [[Goldpeak Mines]]. Magma surges destroyed parts of the shrine during egress.
- DR 1747‑06‑01: First delve into the Deepriver Clan mine at [[Goldpeak Mountain]]; upper galleries included ankheg and death dog encounters; the party withdrew to regroup.
- DR 1747‑07‑19 → 07‑25: Expedition to [[Blacksilver Peak]]. Approach across the plains included hobgoblin patrols, a frost giant with remorhaz, basilisks, and a troll lair at the cave entrance. A giant eagle aided passage to the old Dwarven road. The “Endless Stair” climbed within the mountain, passing a collapsed section, a broken waystation with black puddings, and emerging to glacier country en route to [[Airion’s Tower]].
- Later arc: Deep levels under Goldpeak were held by the beholder [[Vilaxes]] (dolgaunt minions, alarm gongs, gas‑spore/pit trap, explosive glyphs, corrupted minotaurs). Central sanctum featured a grotesque treasure‑melted idol and assorted potions and items.
