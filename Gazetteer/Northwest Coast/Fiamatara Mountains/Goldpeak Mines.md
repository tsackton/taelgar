## Campaign Notes (GL)

- DR 1747‑04‑05: [[Flamekeeper Scroll]] recovered from the Forge of Fire.
- DR 1747‑06‑01: Initial foray into the Deepriver mines beneath [[Goldpeak Mountain]].
- Later arc: Assault on [[Vilaxes]] and liberation of the deeper caverns.

## Notable Areas

- Forge of Fire — A kobold‑held shrine to a “fire god” rune where the [[Flamekeeper Scroll]] was recovered by the party (DR 1747‑04‑05). Its destruction triggered a magma eruption that collapsed portions of the shrine.
- Deepriver shafts — Upper levels tied to pre‑War Dwarven mining under [[Goldpeak Mountain]], scene of multiple delves starting DR 1747‑06‑01.
- Deep sanctum — In later events, the lower levels were controlled by the beholder [[Vilaxes]] and featured corrupted minions, aberrant traps, and a grotesque treasure‑melted idol.
