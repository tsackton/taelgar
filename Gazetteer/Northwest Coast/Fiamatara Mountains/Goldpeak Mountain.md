One of the southernmost major peaks of the [[Fiamatara Mountains]], locally famed for the ancient [[Deepriver Clan]] mines beneath it. The mountain’s upper works connect to wider mine networks collectively called the [[Goldpeak Mines]].

## Campaign Notes (GL)

- DR 1747‑06‑01: First expedition reaches the Deepriver mine entrance, encountering ankhegs, death dogs, and other threats before retreating to regroup.
- Later arc: The deeper caverns below the mountain became the lair of the beholder [[Vilaxes]].
