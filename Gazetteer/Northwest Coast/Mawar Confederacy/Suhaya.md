The largest town at the mouth of the [[Sulqat]] River. A busy port for the [[Mawar Confederacy]], sustained by salmon runs and river trade to the interior. Notable in the travels of [[Wazir]], who overwintered here in DR 1708 during a grand tour before journeying upriver along an unseasonably frozen Sulqat.

## Notes and People

- Seasonal extremes are recorded, including a winter cold enough to freeze the Sulqat’s surface.
- Appears in Mawar campaign backgrounds as a formative stop in Wazir’s youth.
