# The Leviathan Inn

The Leviathan Inn is a large inn in [[Hamri]], set over the harbor waters of Low Town. It is one of the best-known gathering places in the town, frequented by sailors, traders, and locals alike. The inn is named for (and dominated by) a reconstructed leviathan skeleton suspended from the ceiling of its great hall: a vast skull with three empty eye sockets, a ribcage like the timbers of a ship, and a tail so long it vanishes beyond the beams.

The inn is owned by [[Wazir]], a local artificer and scholar.
