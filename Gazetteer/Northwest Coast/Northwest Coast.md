## Topography and Major Features
_See more: [[Mawakel Peninsula]], [[~Mawakel Border Mountains~]], [[Tawir Forest]], [[Erbalta Plains]], [[~North Bay~]]



## Civilizations and Cultures
_See more: [[Mawar Confederacy]], [[Chardonian Empire]]_

Although in the years before the [[Great War]] and the [[Blood Years]] that followed this was a diversely populated land, few survived the scourge of [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]], [[Orcs|orcs]], and worse that plagued the land after the fall of [[Cha'mutte]]. Today, most humans owe allegiance to the expanding [[Chardonian Empire]], of which [[Voltara]] is the leading city in the region. On the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], the [[Mawar Confederacy]] stands fiercely independent. A significant group of salt lizardfolk live in the tidal flats and salt marshes of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]], but there are few dwarves, elves, or stoneborn in this region.

## DM Notes and Meta
_See also: [[Places in the Northwest Coast]]

*Area and Borders:* This region has only weakly defined borders on the north and east; broadly it is meant to divide areas with potential civilization from more wild and dangerous regions.

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The immediate area of Voltara, and the Mawakel Peninsula, are also substantially developed both in recent history and politics and culture. The Mawakel Peninsula has extensive historical development, but the Voltara region, although connected to the larger story of the rise and fall of Drankor, and then the subsequent rise of Chardon, is not well defined prior to the Great War. 

*Brainstorming and Potential Canon:* There are a number of semi-canonical brainstorming about the history of the Mawakel Peninsula; the history since the Great War is well developed but the deeper history (i.e. where did the Mawar come from) is not committed. Earlier brainstorming suggested a northern/Drankor blend but this is not canonical and alternatives are possible. The Mawar require some different religious flavor of Mos Numena than Chardon/Drankor but the source of this is not determined.

*Needs Development:*  In general the area west of Voltara including the [[Fiamatara Mountains]] is weakly developed and would benefit from some historical and cultural development. 

*Intentionally Blank:* The [[Tawir Forest]] and [[~Mawakel Large Island~]] are best left undeveloped, except perhaps in very broad strokes, until a game requires them. The [[~North Bay~]] in general is intentionally blank as is the border with the [[Far North]].

*Adventures:* The [[Mawar Adventures]] episodes are entirely set in this region, on the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]; the [[Great Library Campaign]] is based in [[Voltara]] with several adventures covering the local area around Voltara.

*Important Places in Staging:* The [[~North Bay~]] and [[~Mawakel Border Mountains~]] could use names; the [[Nahadi]] river is not well named north of [[Lake Valandros]]. The [[~Mawakel Large Island~]] is totally undeveloped and could use at least a name.
