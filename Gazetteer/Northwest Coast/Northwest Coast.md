### 2. The Northwest Coast

*Area:* This includes the western coastal region north of the [[Mawakel Peninsula]] including the coasts the large bay north of Mawakel ([[~North Bay~]]), the large headland farther north, and the large unnamed island off the Mawakel Peninsula. 

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* The existence of the [[~North Bay~]] is required by more canonical development of [[Mawakel Peninsula]] and the [[Voltara]] region.

*Non-Canonical Development:* This region has been assumed to have been one of the first points where the [[~Northerner~]] culture emigrated to from [[Hkar]] and thus cultural development in this regional should probably be inspired by the other [[~Northerner~]] cultures, although other options are possible.

*Blank Regions:* Essentially this entire region is intentionally blank and should be left undeveloped until needed for a game. 

*Adventures:* No adventures have been set in this region. 
### 3. Chardonian Empire and the Mawakel Peninsula

*Area:* This region stretches north from the [[~South Chardon River~]] and includes the [[Chasa-Nahadi Watershed]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the [[Voltara]] region, as well as the [[~North Chardon Coast~]], the [[Tawir Forest]], and the [[Mawakel Peninsula]].

*Canonical Development and Constraints:* Although some features lack names, this region is substantially developed in broad strokes, especially the current day large-scale political organization, and the basic geography and climate. The Chasa River Valley, including the city of Chardon, has lots of current-day canonical details; the immediate area of Voltara, and the Mawakel Peninsula, are also substantially developed. Most of the history of this region only exists in very broad strokes, although the Mawakel Peninsula has extensive historical development. 

*Non-Canonical Development:* While this region has a canonical history in broad strokes, many details are only weakly or non-canonically developed, or left blank. Although canonically most of this region is part of the Chardonian Empire, the local political cultures are largely undeveloped. 

*Blank Regions:* The  [[~North Chardon Coast~]], [[Lake Valandros]], and the region stretching from the [[Tawir Forest]] to the coast west of [[Voltara]] are largely blank, but could use some additional development. The history and current political culture of this region exists only in very broad strokes, for the most part, and could use additional development. Nowhere in this region is intentionally left blank, except perhaps the [[Tawir Forest]] itself. 

*Adventures:* The [[Mawar Adventures]] episodes are entirely set in this region, on the [[Mawakel Peninsula]]; the [[Great Library Campaign]] is based in [[Voltara]] with several adventures covering the local area around Voltara; the Dunmar Frontier campaign Chardon/Elderwood arc was set in this region.
