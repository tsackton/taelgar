#### Northern Frontier

- North of the [[Lake Valandros]], settlement density drops considerably, and area has a more ‘frontier’ feel
    
- Around [[Voltara]] -- northernmost big city in the Empire -- is a notable settlement, with an economy powered by chalyte mines in the northern mountains, which provides incredible value and wealth when sold south
    
- [[Endless Ocean]] coast west of [[Voltara]] some settlement. 
    
- Most trade either goes south along river (not consistently navigable above the lake, though), or west to coast/overland to north of [[~North Chardon Coast~]], then south by ship.
    
- All of this area was once small kingdoms, often mix of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]/Northlander heritage, that were essentially completely wiped out by Pandor/[[Hobgoblins]]/Cha’mutte in the post-Great-War period
    
- Beyond here, land of [[Orcs]] and [[Hobgoblins]]; this area was generally reclaimed in the past 100-150 years, after [[Blood Years]], so Chardon was pushed back, and then pushed forward
