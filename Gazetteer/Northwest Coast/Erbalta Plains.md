The Erbalta Plains are a large open steppe along the [[Snake River]] valley. This is a land of scrubby grass, wind-twisted sagebrush, and silver bunchgrasses; shallow coulees dot the lowlands along the river, their chalky banks bright with purple thistle, while dusty limestone bluffs rise softly in the highlands. Along the river, cottonwood groves and reed beds thrive, while herds of wild goats and pronghorn roam the plains. 

The Erbalta Plains are too dry for extensive agriculture outside of irrigated fields in riparian valleys, though barley, flax, and drought-tolerant pulses are common, and hay from riparian meadows is crucial to support animal stock. The Erbalta is excellent grazeland, and hardy sheep and goats are a common sight on the plains.

## Climate

Isolated from the moderating influence of the [[Endless Ocean]] by the rugged [[Tawir Forest]] and the steep [[Fiamatara Mountains]], the Erbalta Plains have a cold, semi-arid climate, with limited annual precipitation that mostly falls in the late winter and early spring. Summers and long, and often hot, dry, and windy, while winters are crisp with occasional light snowfall. Occasional spring and autumn squalls along the main river provide the brief growing season that sustains the region’s hardy grasslands and scattered riparian groves.

### DM Notes

Northern part - north of Voltara - is largely unsettled and was the home base of [[Grumella's Horde]]. They were defeated in the Great Library campaign ([[Grumella's War]]), potentially leaving a power vacuum. This is rugged steppe, and more rugged to the northeast. Lots of little canyons, etc. Dangerous and not patrolled. 

Southern part - herders and (some) farmers, the Voltara hinterlands. But not densely settled. Also supports relative dense centaur populations. Safer; the road south is heavily patrolled; oltara is economically based around the chalyte trade, and probably is a net importer of food from elsewhere in the Empire. Most goods travel south to Lake Valandros overland, and then to Chardon by riverboat. The main river in the plains is not reliably navigable by anything large enough to move substantial goods. 

### Etymology

(from ChatGPT)

|Stage|Spelling on artefacts & maps|English-style pronunciation|Why it sounds that way|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|**ʿArav-altā**|/ah-**RAHV** ahl-**TAH**/|Root **ʿArav** mirrors Heb. _ʿarabah_ “steppe/plain,” whose modern Israeli form is pronounced _ah-RA-vah_ ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzSXGHnqfHQ&utm_source=chatgpt.com "How to Pronounce Arabah? (CORRECTLY) - YouTube"), [Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/6160.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com "6160. עֲרָבָה (arabah) -- Desert, Plain, Wilderness, Steppe")). Northros keeps a back /ḥ/ (dropped in the table form) and final long _-ā_.|
|2|**Arbalta** (early Imperial transliteration)|/ahr-**BAHL**-tah/|Drankorian scribes lose the guttural ʿ > Ø and shift v > b, exactly the change seen when _ʿarabah_ entered Greek & Latin texts ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabah?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Arabah")). Stress stays on the middle syllable.|
|3|**Herbalta** (folk-etymologised “tall-grass”)|/her-**BAHL**-tah/|Scholars re-parse **Arb-** as Lat. _herb-_ “grass” ([Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/herba?utm_source=chatgpt.com "herba - Wiktionary, the free dictionary"), [Latin Dictionary](https://latindictionary.wikidot.com/noun%3Aherba?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Herba - The Latin Dictionary")) and tag on feminine _alta_ “high/tall” ([Latin Dictionary](https://www.latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/alta?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Latin Definitions for: alta (Latin Search) - Latin-Dictionary.net"), [Fiveable](https://library.fiveable.me/key-terms/ap-latin/alta-nominative-singular?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Alta - nominative singular - (AP Latin) - Vocab, Definition, Explanations")); Latin gives a clear /h/ and keeps broad /a/.|
|4|**Erbalta** (vernacular Drankorian)|/air-**BAHL**-tuh/|In many Romance lines initial _h-_ became silent and the vowel fronted (_herba_ → _erba_, “grass” in modern Italian) ([Collins Dictionary](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/italian-english/erba?utm_source=chatgpt.com "English Translation of “ERBA” \| Collins Italian-English Dictionary")); the same loss yields **Er-** here. Unstressed final _-a_ shortens to /uh/.|
|5|**Erbalta Plains** (Common-tongue trade maps)|/air-**BAWL**-tuh PLAYNZ/|Traders keep the local sound **Er-** and add a redundant Common generic “Plains,” just as “Sahara Desert” repeats the meaning of _ṣaḥrāʾ_ “desert” ([Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com/first-name-meaning/alta?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Alta : Meaning and Origin of First Name - Ancestry.com")). Frontier English eyes round the middle vowel to /aw/ by analogy with “bald, brawl.”|
