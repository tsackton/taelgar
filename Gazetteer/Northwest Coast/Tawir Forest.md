Tawir forest is east of the Mawakel Peninsula and north of Lake Valandros. It is a dense, ancient forest, characterized by a thick, lush understory and frequent fog. 

%% notes
real world analogs might be something like forests of Brittany or the Black Forest, or something like the Valdivian Temperate Rainforest or the Olympic Peninsula. Not dominated by huge evengreens (a la redwoods), more of a mixed temperate broadleaf forest
