# The Northern Provinces

The Northern Provinces refer to the collection of provinces of the [[Chardonian Empire]] north of [[Lake Valandros]]. With the exception of the immediate vicinity around the north shore of the lake (south of the confluence of the [[Snake River]] and the [[Zarnato]]), this is largely lightly settled frontier land, repopulated by Chardonian settlers over the last century. The major economic engine of the Northern Provinces is [[chalyte]], mined extensively near [[Voltara]]. 

By far the wealthiest and most significant of the Northern Provinces is [[Greater Voltara]]. The remaining provinces are generally either minor border provinces primarily occupied for defense against hobgoblins, orcs, and other dangers of the far north, or the relatively impoverished provinces of the north shore of [[Lake Valandros]].

## DM Notes

Relatively little is canonically developed about the politics and imperial organization of the northern frontier. Here is what exists, a bit disorganized.
- Voltara itself is a major city, and also a new(ish) city. It did not exist prior to the discovery of chalyte, and is more or less greenfield development (perhaps growing out of a Chardonian fort, but not older ruins). 
- The area between the [[Snake River]] and the [[Zarnato]] is largely a border territory. There are fortified defenses in a line along the northern frontier (marked on the map with camps/forts), but the interior "between the rivers" is very lightly settled. The ~50 miles closest to the border is likely not really settled at all; settlement density increases to the south and the lower 1/3 of square 10-I on the hex map probably has good grazelands. 
- Voltara itself is connected to the heart of the empire by two major routes: 
	- One leads south along a very good (Chardonian, not Drankorian) road to the north shore of Lake Valandros, and then via ship across the lake and down the river. 
	- The other heads west to the coast, and then either via ship around Mawar to Chardon, or overland via the Tawir Forest road and the edge of the [[~Mawakel Border Mountains~]], into the northern part of the [[~North Chardon Coast~]]. 
	- For as yet determined reasons, most goods, especially chalyte, travel the first route, while messengers and some travelers often go the second way. For example, it is established in the Great Library campaign that large caravans travel up from Lake Valandros on the road; however, when the party originally came north from Chardon, they went via the coast, and some messengers also traveled that way. 
	- My best guess right now is a combination of difficult roads and possibly a border tariff from the polity west of Voltara ("North Kingdom 5 remnants") means that heavy goods need

#### Northern Frontier

- North of the [[Lake Valandros]], settlement density drops considerably, and area has a more ‘frontier’ feel
    
- Around [[Voltara]] -- northernmost big city in the Empire -- is a notable settlement, with an economy powered by chalyte mines in the northern mountains, which provides incredible value and wealth when sold south
    
- [[Endless Ocean]] coast west of [[Voltara]] some settlement. 
    
- Most trade either goes south along river (not consistently navigable above the lake, though), or west to coast/overland to north of [[~North Chardon Coast~]], then south by ship.
    
- All of this area was once small kingdoms, often mix of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]/Northlander heritage, that were essentially completely wiped out by Pandor/[[Hobgoblins]]/Cha’mutte in the post-Great-War period
    
- Beyond here, land of [[Orcs]] and [[Hobgoblins]]; this area was generally reclaimed in the past 100-150 years, after [[Blood Years]], so Chardon was pushed back, and then pushed forward
