# The Northern Provinces

The Northern Provinces refer to the collection of provinces of the [[Chardonian Empire]] north of [[Lake Valandros]]. With the exception of the immediate vicinity around the north shore of the lake (south of the confluence of the [[Snake River]] and the [[Zarnato]]), this is largely lightly settled frontier land, repopulated by Chardonian settlers over the last century. The major economic engine of the Northern Provinces is [[chalyte]], mined extensively near [[Voltara]]. 

By far the wealthiest and most significant of the Northern Provinces is [[Greater Voltara]]. The remaining provinces are generally either minor border provinces primarily occupied for defense against hobgoblins, orcs, and other dangers of the far north, or the relatively impoverished provinces of the north shore of [[Lake Valandros]].

## DM Notes

Relatively little is canonically developed about the politics and imperial organization of the northern frontier. Here is what exists, a bit disorganized.
- Voltara itself is a major city, and also a new(ish) city. It did not exist prior to the discovery of chalyte, and is more or less greenfield development (perhaps growing out of a Chardonian fort, but not older ruins). 
- The area between the [[Snake River]] and the [[Zarnato]] is largely a border territory. There are fortified defenses in a line along the northern frontier (marked on the map with camps/forts), but the interior "between the rivers" is very lightly settled. The ~50 miles closest to the border is likely not really settled at all; settlement density increases to the south and the lower 1/3 of square 10-I on the hex map probably has good graze lands. 
- Voltara itself is connected to the heart of the empire by two major routes: 
	- One leads south along a very good (Chardonian, not Drankorian) road to the north shore of Lake Valandros, and then via ship across the lake and down the river. This is about 450 miles on roads from Voltara to Lake Valandros, and then about 700 miles via lake and river to Chardon. 
	- The other heads west to the coast, and then either via ship around Mawar to Chardon, or overland via the Tawir Forest road and the edge of the [[~Mawakel Border Mountains~]], into the northern part of the [[~North Chardon Coast~]]. This is about 225 miles overland to the coast, and then 2200 miles on the ocean around Mawar, or 725 miles overland plus 800 miles on the ocean. 
	- For as yet determined reasons, most goods, especially chalyte going from Voltara to Chardon, travel the first route, while messengers and some travelers (coming from Chardon) often go the second way. For example, it is established in the Great Library campaign that large caravans travel up from Lake Valandros on the road; however, when the party originally came north from Chardon, they went via the coast, and some messengers also traveled that way. This is likely a combination of the interior route being shorter and better protected for goods going south, but fighting upriver slows it enough that except in good conditions it can be faster to send people via the coastal route. 
- Culturally, [[Greater Voltara]] is a bit of a "gold rush" frontier, largely settled on empty land (this is where the "big evil" was, and where Amani was, but Amani was essentially entirely destroyed). The north shore of Lake Valandros is quite culturally distinct, but is totally undeveloped except this place *wasn't* conquered by the "big evil". Other areas generally lightly settled.
- The western edge of the Northern Provinces is very much not developed. It is not even completely clear whether the Chardonian Empire extends all the way to the coast or exactly what the border is like west of the gap between the mountains to the west of Voltara. This probably needs development. Chardon definitely does not control the whole region between the [[Fiatara Mountains]] and the [[~North Bay~]], but might control the southern part? If so, this is probably a different province than [[Greater Voltara]]. 
- Given the extent of [[Greater Voltara]], there is probably at least one additional province to the east ("between the rivers", might be two), at least two in the Lake Valandros area (probably not three), and possibly one to the west, unless [[Greater Voltara]] is the edge of the empire on the western edge. 
- In terms of defense: for whatever reason (not yet determined), Voltara was not adequately defended to defeat a substantial orc army during [[Grumella's War]], and had to rely on [[Great Library Session Notes - Arc 2|PCs]] for defense while troops marched from the south. This could be incompetence, a false sense of security due to the fact that historically the northern [[Erbalta Plains]] were full of disorganized and warring orc tribes that posed little threat, the distractions of the Nevos campaign in the south, some combination, or something else entirely.

† What an ordinary merchant or well-equipped adventuring party can expect.

## Route A — Voltara → Lake Valandros (road) → Chardon (lake + river)

|Leg|Distance|Best-case time|Typical time|
|---|---|---|---|
|Voltara → North shore of Lake Valandros (good road)|450 mi|**≈ 9 days**|**≈ 23 days**|
|Across Lake Valandros & down the Valandros/Nahadi River to Chardon|700 mi|**≈ 6 days**|**≈ 10 days**|
|**Total**|**1 150 mi**|**≈ 15 days**|**≈ 33 days**|

---

## Route B — Voltara → West coast, then…

### B-1  …by sea around Mawar to Chardon

|Leg|Distance|Best-case|Typical|
|---|---|---|---|
|Voltara → coast (good road)|225 mi|**≈ 5 days**|**≈ 11 days**|
|Coastal voyage around Mawar|2 200 mi|**≈ 16-18 days**|**≈ 24-26 days**|
|**Total**|**2 425 mi**|**≈ 21-23 days**|**≈ 35-37 days**|

### B-2  …overland via the Tawir Forest Road, then short coastal hop

|Leg|Distance|Best-case|Typical|
|---|---|---|---|
|Voltara → North Chardon Coast via Tawir Forest / Mawakel edge|725 mi|**≈ 29-30 days**|**≈ 48-50 days**|
|Short coastal voyage into Chardon|800 mi|**≈ 6-7 days**|**≈ 9 days**|
|**Total**|**1 525 mi**|**≈ 35-37 days**|**≈ 57-59 days**|

### Reading the numbers

- **Best-case** assumes haste, fine weather, and relay or chartered vessels; subtract a few days only if the party is _exceptionally_ lucky and lightly laden.
    
- **Typical** is what reliable merchants, pilgrims, or a well-provisioned adventuring company can plan for—bad weather or animal illness can still add extra days.
    
- Add **2-3 buffer days** per port transfer or seasonal fair if cargo inspection, customs, or waiting for a convoy is likely.

### Reverse Journey — **Chardon → upriver & overland → Voltara**

|Leg|Distance|Best-case time*|Typical time†|Why it’s slower|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Chardon → Lake Valandros (upriver on the Nahadi / Lake crossing)**|700 mi|**≈ 12 days** (≈ 60 mi day⁻¹)**|**≈ 18–20 days** (≈ 35–40 mi day⁻¹)|Sails often useless against the current; crews resort to rowing, poling, or mule-towpaths at bends. Occasional portage around shoals adds lay-days.|
|**Lake Valandros → Voltara (good Chardonian road)**|450 mi|**≈ 9 days**|**≈ 23 days**|Same rolling road grades as the south-bound trip.|
|**Whole route**|**1 150 mi**|**≈ 21 days**|**≈ 41–43 days**||

* Best-case assumes a purpose-built river galley with a double crew for continuous rowing and a favourable following wind across the lake, plus relay horses on the road.  
† Typical reflects a freight barge or packet boat (daylight travel only) and a well-provisioned merchant caravan on the road.

**Rule of thumb:** expect the upriver leg to take **about 60 % longer** than drifting downstream, and budget an extra buffer day for every 200 river-miles in spring when melt-flows run strongest.
