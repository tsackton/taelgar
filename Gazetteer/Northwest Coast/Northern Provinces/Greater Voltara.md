Greater Voltara is the richest and most powerful of the [[Northern Provinces]] of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. The primary city and provincial seat is [[Voltara]], a walled city rich from the [[chalyte]] wealth in the surrounding hills. 

Greater Voltara extends in the east to the [[Snake River]], in the west to the [[Fiamatara Mountains]], and in the south to the [[Kelvaros]] river area. The northern border of Greater Voltara is not well-defined, but functionally includes the [[~North Voltara Hills~|hills north of Voltara]] (a rich source of [[chalyte]]), and the southern edge of the [[Fiamatara Mountains]].
