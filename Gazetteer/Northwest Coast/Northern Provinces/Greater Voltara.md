Greater Voltara is the richest and most powerful of the [[Northern Provinces]] of the [[Chardonian Empire]]. The primary city and provincial seat is [[Voltara]], a walled city enriched by nearby [[chalyte]] deposits, and the seat of power of proconsul [[Anton Lavernia]]. 

Greater Voltara extends in the east to the [[Snake River]], in the west to the [[Fiamatara Mountains]], and in the south to the [[Kelvaros]] river area. The northern border of Greater Voltara is not well‑defined, but functionally includes the [[~North Voltara Hills~|hills north of Voltara]] (a rich source of [[chalyte]]), and the southern edge of the [[Fiamatara Mountains]].

## Settlements and Sites

- [[Voltara]] — Provincial seat; walled city with restricted access and prosperous inner precincts; major outer settlement caters to caravans and travelers. 
- [[Pietravola Abbey]] — Ruined abbey outside Voltara.
- [[Lonely Watchtower]] — Former orc raiding base during DR 1747 activity in the hinterlands.
- [[Order of Twilight Temple (Voltara)]] — Desecrated temple outside [[Voltara]] cleansed and reconsecrated in DR 1747 by [[Galius Filuso]] and the [[Silver Tempests]].
