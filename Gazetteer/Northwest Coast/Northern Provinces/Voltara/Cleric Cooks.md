## Campaign Notes (GL)

- DR 1748‑08‑07: Grand opening of Cleric Cooks, celebrated with a party attended by friends and allies, transported in part by [[Samso]]’s plant‑based teleportation.
- Downtime notes indicate Brelith trained with Finoc Small prior to opening; the venue is “fancy‑ish” within the city walls.
