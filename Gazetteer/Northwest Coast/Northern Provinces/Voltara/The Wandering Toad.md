A small, welcoming inn just inside the city walls of [[Voltara]]. Known for wild game, mushrooms, and ale, and run by the unusually large halfling [[Finoc Small]]. Served as lodging for the party during planning for the [[Battle of Voltara]]. [[Brelith]] apprenticed with the chef here before opening [[Cleric Cooks]].
