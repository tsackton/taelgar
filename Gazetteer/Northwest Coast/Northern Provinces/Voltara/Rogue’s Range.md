A raucous tavern and dive bar outside the walls of [[Voltara]], opened by [[Alton]] during the Silver Tempests’ rise. Features games of skill for patrons (axe‑throwing and similar diversions), loud music, and a rough‑and‑ready crowd.

## Campaign Notes (GL)

- Opened during the party’s Arc 4 downtime as part of the city’s post‑war boom.
