# The Purple Pig
>[!info]+ Information  
> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Affiliations")`  
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

A modest inn situated in the settlement outside the walls of [[Voltara]], serving caravan guards, merchants, prospectors from the northern hills, and messengers moving between the city and the frontier. The Purple Pig is a reliable, unpretentious house, and a convenient neutral ground for arranging meetings between travelers and city contacts. 

The inn is operated by its proprietor, [[Dravia]], who maintains a well‑run common room and is known for keeping abreast of news on the roads. During the unrest that culminated in [[Grumella's War]] and the [[Battle of Voltara]] (DR 1747), the Purple Pig was destroyed in the fighting on the outskirts of the city; it was rebuild with the aid of the [[Silver Tempests]] in the following months. 

## Location and Layout

Located in the outer settlement along the south road below the city walls, the inn stands amid wayhouses, stables, and market stalls that cater to caravans bound for [[Lake Valandros]] and the southern provinces. Its common room served as a gathering place for road news and arrangements with caravan masters; rooms above provided simple lodging for travelers.

## Proprietor

- [[Dravia]] — proprietor and barkeep; locally known for arranging introductions between visitors and caravan masters when coin or goodwill merited it.

Metagame and campaign notes

- Modest accommodations outside the walls; typical rate 1 gp per day (DM notes).
- The Great Library sometimes billeted visitors here while working in Voltara; numerous early meetings with Archivist Lyra took place in the common room.
- DM notes describe midday as quiet, with Dravia arranging meetings (e.g., introduction to [[Quintus Percomia]] at the inn; “1 silver each” as her fee in one scene).
- Used as a practical starting point for excursions to nearby sites (e.g., [[Pietravola Abbey]], the [[Drowned Tower]]).
- Destroyed during Grumella’s attacks on the outskirts prior to/around the [[Battle of Voltara]]; no canon record here of a reconstruction timeline.
