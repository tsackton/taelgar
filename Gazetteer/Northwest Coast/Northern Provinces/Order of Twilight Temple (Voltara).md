Ruins of an [[Order of Twilight]] temple south‑west of [[Voltara]], desecrated during the [[Blood Years]] and later corrupted by an Abyssal breach in the crypts. Reconsecrated in DR 1747 when [[Galius Filuso]] completed a 24‑hour casting of Hallow, defended by the [[Silver Tempests]].

## Restoration Timeline (GL Arc 1)

- DR 1747‑06‑30: Research in Voltara identifies the likely location of the ruins; the party departs.
- DR 1747‑07‑04: [[Galius Filuso]] recruited in Voltara to perform the ritual.
- DR 1747‑07‑06: Portal sealed and temple cleansed after a day‑long defense against demon and xvart assaults.

Recovered items included temple silver and order‑marked relics; Abyssal corruption had spawned maw demons, rutterkin, and a glabrezu as the final assault as the portal closed.
