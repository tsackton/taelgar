Voltara temple — Desecrated during the Blood Years and later corrupted by an Abyssal breach in its crypt. On 1747‑07‑06 DR the portal was closed when Galius completed a 24‑hour casting of Hallow while the party held the line, after earlier reconnaissance and demon‑clearing forays (key dates: 1747‑06‑30 research and departure; 1747‑07‑04 recruitment of Galius; 1747‑07‑06 cleansing).
