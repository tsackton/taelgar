# Elves

_In the dark and the void we awoke, our eyes opened to the stars above, and there was color and light and life in the world for the first time. Behold! For we are the First."_  
-- Memories of the First, Elven Oral Tradition.

Under the trees of a great forest, a living palace of air and light and flowers, humming with the weave of Magic holding it together, the sound of song drifting gently to the ground below. At the top of an impossible spire, a fey light glows with power and knowledge as birds and moths come and go with messages. A love of beauty, nature, poetry, artistry, and above all the power of magical energy. These things are the domain of the elves.
## Graceful And Sleek

All elves share a preternatural grace, often appearing hauntingly beautiful to members of many other races. While they are about the same height as humans, they are on average more slender and fine-featured, typically weighing between 100 and 150 pounds. Their coloration tends towards copper and bronze, but can encompass the whole range of human coloration and more, with striking hair of green or gold and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have little body hair and no facial hair. As they age, their coloration often fades slightly, but many are timeless and most other races cannot tell a young elf of 60 from an old one of 750. Elves favor simple but well-tailored and elegantly made clothing.
## Timeless And Haughty

Elves can live a very long time, perhaps forever barring accident or injury. The very oldest elves simply fade away by choice, returning to the wild natural world they love. Their perspective on the world is heavily shaped by their ageless nature -- events that would trouble shorter-lived races are often seen as beneath the notice of the elves. According to Elven mythology, they were the first sentient race to be created by the Gods. Because of this they see themselves as caretakers of the world; all other races seem like children to them, who need to be guided. Elves strongly believe they have the best interests of the world at heart, but often discount the contributions, abilities, and maturity of non-elves.

Elves are the oldest of the Elder races, and they perceive their power, magic, and wisdom as coming from their connection to the Firstborn, the Living Tree and the Wild Star, representing the joining of growth and destruction, birth and death, wisdom and passion. Their connection to the Firstborn gives them a mystical air, and they will offer thanks and prayers to Aldanor (the living tree) and Elmerca (the wild star).

## Wild Homelands

Elves make their home in the wild reaches of the world, weaving elaborate towers and palaces from magical energy and the living world around them. Their skill with woodcraft and magic allow them to hunt, farm, and gather food without leaving a noticeable trace on the wild lands of the home, so travelers coming upon elf cities are usually taken aback by the suddenness with which they emerge out of the landscape. Most elf settlements are relatively small and masked by weaves of fey magic, so visitors or intruders often pass through ignorant of their surroundings. Elves will rarely start a fight, preferring to wait for the tides of history to turn to their side, but when they perceive a danger to the balance of the world they will act with alacrity and bring the full power of their race to bear. Elves very only rarely live among other races, finding the ever-changing world of the younger races (which to elves is all of them) tiring. For most people, elves are creatures of myth and legend, and if they have met one it would have been a notable event in their lives.
## The Elven Cycle of Generations

Elven family life and family traditions are structured around the elven cycle of generations. Each elf reaches childbearing years around the age of 150, and, for the next fifty or so years, is able to have children. But fertility wanes around the age of 200 (or a little before, or a little after), and for the remaining hundreds or thousands of years of an elvish life, they can bear no more children. Therefore, elves have distinct, non-overlapping generations, called the *ka*, which they number. All of the children of a generation are seen as siblings, and the broad bond across the age set is more important than the bonds between two children of the same parents.

When an elf is born they are weak and small, as a human infant, with only the most tenuous connection to Aldanor, the live-giving Living Tree. For the first several years of an elf’s life, as their body grows stronger, they are nurtured and protected by their body parents, typically in seclusion, until, around the age of ten, they are firmly connected to Aldanor, and entwined in the great Tree of Life. This is the Age of Beginning, and it ends with the Rite of Emergence.

A young elf spends most of their childhood, which lasts until around the age of fifty, raised and cared for by their soul parents, amongst their generation-mates. This is a time of learning and play in equal measure and it is when an elf starts to first develop magic. An elf spends much of this time in sleep and dreams, through which much of the deep sense of elven mystery and foresight is imbued by Elmerca. Around the age of fifty, an elf slowly starts to stop sleeping, spending time instead resting their minds in a reflection of their dreams. This is the Age of Becoming, and it ends with the Rite of Awakening.

An elf of fifty is a young adult, in full control of their magic, their mind, and their body. Elves of this age are encouraged to travel and explore, experiment and engage with those outside their community. To some, this means finding other elven lands. To others, it involves a journey to the Feywild. To others, visiting the wild places of the world where only animals walk, and still to others, visiting the human world, or the lands of the other Elder races.
## Tragedy and Loss

The history of the elves on Taelgar is one of cycles of loss and grief. Several times over their history, great evils have arisen, and elves have rallied to meet that evil and defend Taelgar. But each cycle has taken a terrible toll on the elves, and with each turning of the world the elves that live to see such times face grief and loss.

For some Elves, this means a further turn inward, and a desire to retreat from earthly affairs and strive for even greater control over magic and nature. For others, it means a turn outward, and the beginnings of an acknowledgment that Elves cannot protect the world alone, which has meant that Elves are increasingly seen in the human world. But no Elf is unaffected, and the beauty and artistry of Elves is often tinged with sadness.
## Superior Protectors

Because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world, and the oldest and wisest of races, Elves tend to view other races, even long-lived ones like Stoneborn and Dwarves, as children. Sometimes, this manifests as a haughty aloofness, other times as a caring presence, but it is always hard for Elves to treat other races as equals.

**Elves - Trade and Material Goods**

- Elven society is characterized by material abundance, often via close cooperation with the plants. Nuts, fruits, and saps from semi-magic trees are the staple food sources. Vegetarianism is common at home, although (some) elves have no particular moral qualms with eating animals. Hunting and consumption of animal products was probably much much more common amongst the armies of the Great War, on the march, then it would be in elven homelands in the forests. 

From Tim:

This makes sense. Indeed I think one of the things that distinguishes the elder races in general is the idea that their societies tend to be associated with material abundance. Lizardfolk and elves coax the land to produce a rich abundance of food; halflings, at least in the Elder days, sung feasts into creation; stoneborn, at least in the Elder days, hardly need sustenance at all; dwarves perhaps have highly "technological" approaches to very high density agricultural (with magical sunlight so plants can grow 24 hours, no need to worry about cold or heat, maybe some semi-magical ways to provide water). 

Perhaps this is a defining feature of all the "children of embodied gods" - so orcs perhaps can eat and extract nutrients from nearly anything and so can survive in very marginal habitats.

  
 
 * Elven society has no significant material accumulations of wealth, i.e. there are not kings or rich folk with tons of gold and money in opposition to middle class/poor folk with limited money
 
 * Elven society none-the-less is not a communist happy-hippie-commune, elves really do see differences in "wealth" between themselves, but it is measured by what you create not what you own
 
I see what you are going for and I like it - but maybe the solution is simpler. Maybe there is just no real value in accumulating wealth in elven society. People might collect art because they like it, or books, but the idea of accumulating wealth for the sake of wealth is just....weird. This could easily arise simply from the idea of material abundance - like, there are no billionaires in Star Trek because what does that even mean? Elves on the outside would sometimes accumulate wealth, because it allows them to accomplish useful things. 


I elaborate on this below, but imagine if the elves - at home, anyway - can basically grow whatever they want. Harvest gold from trees, spin silver from moonlight, etc. Accumulating gold is kind of pointless, then. If you want it, you just plant a gold tree (in reality it would be more complicated and magical than that, but that's the vibe). What is limiting is creative / artistic / intellectual / whatever production. 

  

So then you get a society where there is no real concept of wealth because there isn't anything you can buy with money - at home, elves probably don't use money for anything (although perhaps they do mint coins for various purposes, or at least used to). 

  

However, you still get the "wealth" in the sense of poetry, art, painting, smithing, gardening/growing, etc, as you discuss.

Magic is the obvious answer. Elves were the first, they walked the world before any humanoid. In the beginning, there wouldn't be anyone to trade with anyway - it was just elves. So maybe the early elves figured out how to grow metal with magic, and carefully crystalize gemstones from flowers over years, and transmute leaves and vines to dyes, and grow insects that spin not just silk, but cotton and linen and all manner of fabric. 

  

You walk into an elven city, and it isn't oriented around trade and commerce the way human cities are. There are strange trees, and a vaguely feywild feel, and gardens of gemstones just beginning to bud from stalks and bright silk butterflies emerging from cocoons that are spun from silk that is harvested for clothes. 

  

And maybe these things aren't easy to do, so it isn't like elves are secret billionaires, or like dragons with giant hoards of wealth. But they are possible to do, so there is no motivation to trade, really. Maybe in the past, there was more trade, say before the Great War perhaps there was some casual commerce between the elves and Chardon, or the dwarves - not because the elves needed anything but because it was interesting, and new. But now with many of the elves who remain in hiding, it has mostly gone away.

 I think this is not about selling a painting or a book or whatever, it is about  _being_ a painter, or a poet, or whatever.  Just like in the real world, intellectual property doesn't mean that you can't sell a book. It means you can't publish a derivative book. The idea here is that elves take this seriously. Perhaps extending it to magic needs a bit of thought so as to not cut off PC elf wizards, but at the same time, it is pretty easy to make it about the elf. There is no reason it would need to be seen as odd if an elf wizard was happy enough to sell their spell-creations. The idea here is that Delwath would certainly not agonize about selling a book, but if he was publishing a book of poetry he'd be hesitant to make it too similar to someone's existing style. 

I think this idea is worth developing a little bit, but I guess I don't yet have a good sense of the vibe. I like the idea that there is "richer and poorer" in elven society based not on material wealth but on what you create, what new things you bring into the world. But I'm not sure how this fits with strong intellectual property protections, which seem more about enabling capitalism and guaranteeing return on investment. If it is about the value of the artist, couldn't you go the other way and say that elven artists want to be copied, since that proves their worth? If no one imitates you, you don't make a mark on the world, that kind of thing.

## Brainstorming from Google Docs
Five races (elves, dwarves, stoneborn, lizardfolk, and halflings) are known as the Elder Races. They were created by the Divine before time, through the influence and action of the Firstborn of their race, as described in more detail in the [description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lXvZcuZZhv9DriPABcfw6EMVS7JQXqQmX9JlPvUWR_k/edit#) of gods and the age of myth. These races draw their strength and abilities through their connection to the Embodied Gods, which both gives them power and constrains them. While some of these races are relatively common (dwarves and halflings), others are uncommon (lizardfolk, stoneborn), or rare (elves). 

  

Elves, the oldest of the Elder races, ancient and fey, graceful and full of magic, but also haughty and aloof to the world of the younger races, are described in this document. The D&D mechanics of this race are on [D&D Beyond.](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/372362-elf-taelgar)

### Overview

  

“In the dark and the void we awoke, our eyes opened to the stars above, and there was color and light and life in the world for the first time. Behold! For we are the First.”

  

 -- Memories of the First Ones, Elven Oral Tradition

  

Under the trees of a great forest, a living palace of air and light and flowers, humming with the weave of Magic holding it together, the sound of song drifting gently to the ground below. At the top of an impossible spire, a fae light glows with power and knowledge as birds and moths come and go with messages. A love of beauty, nature, poetry, artistry, and above all the power of magical energy. These things are the domain of the elves.

For most people, elves are creatures of myth and legend, and if they have met one it would have been a notable event in their lives. The major exception is the Halfborn, who while Elves by nature share some Human characteristics and can be found living alone or in small settlements among other races, often as artisans, teachers, diplomats, or artists.

#### Tragedy and Loss

At the end of the Third Age of the World, the Elves fought as part of the Armies of the Four Heroes against the dragonlord Cha’mutte, and suffered great losses in the Plague Wars and the years after. Never numerous to begin with, the devastation of this event shook the Elves to their core, like nothing had for more than an Age of the world. Many Elves who had never known death before lost friends and family suddenly; a race that had revelled in their power and mastery met their match, and while victorious, emerged decimated. 

  

For some Elves, this has meant a further turn inward, and a desire to retreat from earthly affairs and strive for even greater control over magic and nature. For others, it has meant a turn outward, and the beginnings of an acknowledgment that Elves cannot protect the world alone, which has meant that Elves are increasingly seen in the human world.

The elves worship two gods, Aldanor, the Living Tree, and Elmerca, the Wild Star.

This is the Age of Discovery, and it lasts for about a hundred years, until most elves start to feel a calling to return to their roots. This Age ends with the Rite of Return.

  

The next hundred years of most elves' lives are focused on community and childrearing, as a body parent, or more rarely, a soul parent, or occasionally, both. Most

## Rough Notes and Brainstorming

  

Aldanor and Elmerca, the Living Tree and the Wild Star of the elves first created.

  

Aldanor (the living tree) - 

- Growth but slow and steady and unhurried but unstoppable
    
- Nature and shelter and encompassing protection from the ravages and chaos of (some parts) of the wild natural world
    
- Compassionate 
    

  

Elmerca (the wild star)

- Distance, cold, analytical
    
- Magical and mysterious - far away and hard to understand
    
- A source of great insight and inspiration, but not always straightforward to understand
    
- Farseer, known as source of foreknowledge and prophecy
    

  

Both have a sense of the eternal and the unchanging about them.

  

Early Lore / Creation / Gods

  

In the chaos of the Age of Creation, the Divine Presence watched as their children raised empires from the very form of existence. Towering castles of water floating through the stars as great wyrms flew across the sky trailing endless labyrinths of earth behind them. Titans taller than worlds shaped water and fire with their very hands, and created endless discs for their creations to stand upon. Form followed thought without hesitation, and the land was ever-changing and in flux. Yet in this unimaginable diversity of form, the Divine Presence saw nothing truly new -- only their children, echoed and repeated over and over, ever changing, but never truly different.

  

Est, the beginning, acted first, yearning for something truly new, and something truly permanent. From their very essence was formed a spark of pure energy, embodied with intellect and vision and foresight, and to protect the spark, a sphere of lights was woven, away from the chaos of the divine children. And thus was born the sphere of the stars. And to accompany the spark, Est created a seed, full of lifeforce, and growth. And to give this seed a to grow, Est harvested the best of the many creations of their children - the solid ground, and flowing rivers, the fiery mountains and the very winds of the air, and wove a solid earth. And thus was born Taelgar.

  

But Met, the ending, had much wisdom as well. From Met, the seed learned that without endings, growth becomes a disease, a cancer. The spark learned that without endings, tales grow tiresome, and that the unforeseen something

  

And from the spark, was born Elmerca, and from the seed was born Aldanor. Some kind of story about how they saw the world, foresaw a lot of what was coming with the other races, and created the first elves to prepare the world and welcome the newcomers

  

The elves spread across the world, strong in magic and powerful, and build great cities under the trees and paths in the sky to connect them, and basically a huge elven empire.>

  

Rougher Notes

- Aldanor (body) and Elmerca (mind) created elves with the idea that they would live forever, but with the warning/sense from Met granted them the ability to leave the mortal realm as they chose, when the time was right
    
- The lifeforce of Aldanor flows in each elf which is the source of immortality
    
- In the Years of Myth, the elves worked tirelessly, hunting the orcs, and building and building, endlessly striving to master the world. These were the days of elven seawalls, to keep out the hurricanes, and great magic to protect the lesser races from the evils of the world. The other races did not always appreciate the help, but many empires grew in the shadow of the elvish protection -- still see artifacts etc from this time when the elves were at the height of their power
    
- With the coming of humans, some elves felt a special connection / desire to protect them, and became the half elfs (via a serving of connection with Aldanor, rather than actual interbreeding, so really half elfs are not so much half-human / half-elf as elves who have forsaken part of their heritage 
    
- The Downfall destroyed all this -- some say Elmerca foresaw what was coming, but did not share with the elves  - a bit of a cultural rift here still thinking / playing with it
    
- After the Downfall the elves retreated. Having suffered great losses, 
    

  

“Problems”

- Why so few children? 
    

- Age set -- reproductive age is only a small part of an elves life
    

- What makes an elf die?
    
- How is family and society structured? Don’t like anything too ‘traditional human’
    

  

Family Unit

One brainstorm idea -- children of elves have four parents. The mother and father of the mind / soul (Elmerca) and the mother and father of the body (Aldanor). 

  

History

Not counted by years per se, by ages

Notes on the passing of years:

The elves view the passing of time differently than other races. Time flows for them sometimes much more slowly, and sometimes much more quickly than the shorter-lived races. Given their longevity, they are also greatly attuned to the long cycles of history, and reckon years by the sweep of ages.

  

The ages of the elves mark momentous events, changes in the world that can reshape and reconfigure the face of Taelgar itself. Elven loremasters and scholars can see the coming end of an age, and interpret events, signs and portents to determine when the age has ended and proclaim the new age has come. 

  

The ages of the past:

Like all elves, Delwath has a sense of the depth of time and the past cycles of history, but not being a student of history himself has only a vague and passing awareness of the details.

  

The Age of Creation: the timeless era when elves first came to the world, before the Dreamworld, the Feywild and Shadowfell, and all the other echos and reflections of Taelgar had separated from the Material Plane. The Age of Creation ended with the splitting of the planes and the formation of the echo realms, the other planes that reflect and echo and distort the world of Taelgar. (years not really real here)

  

The Age of Myth: birth of the elves; learning of magic, foretelling of the other races to come, building of great empires, coming of the orcs and other darknesses, elves victorious, defending of the great empires (0 - 2400 years)

  

The Age of Dawn: coming of humans, the first sundering of elves (between the half-elves, who settled in Hkar, and the rest of the elves). Even more victories for the elves, wars against mind flayers, hobgoblins, etc (2400 - 4100)

  

The Age of Sorrow: The downfall of Hkar and the great cataclysm. The elven empires collapse. Many elves die, but more survive than not, just retreat away from the world. An age of retreat from the affairs of others. The second sundering (between those who believed that foreknowledge of the coming disaster would have helped, and those who agreed with Elmerca for hiding it). By the end of the age, elves drawn back into the conflict with Cha’Mutte. Ultimately a greater acceptance that the elven race is not the only protectors.

(4100 - 5700)

  

The Age of Rebirth: current day… elven society is in tormoil

(5700 onward…)

  

30th generation - 4500 - 4

  

Peronar

  

The Peronar, or half-born, are a lineage of elves that left the mainland and the elven kingdoms of  Alcarinquë and Tinwerquë during the ThirdAge and sailed for Hkar, driven by a premonition and fear of the great evil that was coming. On Hkar, they became teachers and guides to the human population; from these elves, the humans of Hkar learned much of the great magical prowess they were later renowned for. But Hkar, the birthplace of humanity, strong in the divine spark of humanity, did not leave these elves untouched, and some part of the humanity of Hkar burrowed into their souls. They lived quicker, died quicker, and lost the will to live indefinitely. 

  

Unlike others of the elder races, the Peronar lived closely with humans, and were a key part of Hkaran society. During the Downfall, the Peronar fought closely with the humans of Hkar, and were crucial to the founding of Drankor. Many Peronar lived and worked in the Drankorian Empire; some, known as the ‘high Peronar’, were a crucial part of the ruling elites of Drankorian society. 

  

After the fall of Drankor, little is known about what happened to the Peronar. Many died in the FirstPlague, but rumors persist of some that fled east, and other, stranger rumors hint that some fled to other planes. Small pockets of Peronar, living with humans or in their own society, must have survived somewhere.**
