**Elves - Trade and Material Goods**

- Elven society is characterized by material abundance, often via close cooperation with the plants. Nuts, fruits, and saps from semi-magic trees are the staple food sources. Vegetarianism is common at home, although (some) elves have no particular moral qualms with eating animals. Hunting and consumption of animal products was probably much much more common amongst the armies of the Great War, on the march, then it would be in elven homelands in the forests. 

From Tim:

This makes sense. Indeed I think one of the things that distinguishes the elder races in general is the idea that their societies tend to be associated with material abundance. Lizardfolk and elves coax the land to produce a rich abundance of food; halflings, at least in the Elder days, sung feasts into creation; stoneborn, at least in the Elder days, hardly need sustenance at all; dwarves perhaps have highly "technological" approaches to very high density agricultural (with magical sunlight so plants can grow 24 hours, no need to worry about cold or heat, maybe some semi-magical ways to provide water). 

Perhaps this is a defining feature of all the "children of embodied gods" - so orcs perhaps can eat and extract nutrients from nearly anything and so can survive in very marginal habitats.

  
 
 * Elven society has no significant material accumulations of wealth, i.e. there are not kings or rich folk with tons of gold and money in opposition to middle class/poor folk with limited money
 
 * Elven society none-the-less is not a communist happy-hippie-commune, elves really do see differences in "wealth" between themselves, but it is measured by what you create not what you own
 
I see what you are going for and I like it - but maybe the solution is simpler. Maybe there is just no real value in accumulating wealth in elven society. People might collect art because they like it, or books, but the idea of accumulating wealth for the sake of wealth is just....weird. This could easily arise simply from the idea of material abundance - like, there are no billionaires in Star Trek because what does that even mean? Elves on the outside would sometimes accumulate wealth, because it allows them to accomplish useful things. 


I elaborate on this below, but imagine if the elves - at home, anyway - can basically grow whatever they want. Harvest gold from trees, spin silver from moonlight, etc. Accumulating gold is kind of pointless, then. If you want it, you just plant a gold tree (in reality it would be more complicated and magical than that, but that's the vibe). What is limiting is creative / artistic / intellectual / whatever production. 

  

So then you get a society where there is no real concept of wealth because there isn't anything you can buy with money - at home, elves probably don't use money for anything (although perhaps they do mint coins for various purposes, or at least used to). 

  

However, you still get the "wealth" in the sense of poetry, art, painting, smithing, gardening/growing, etc, as you discuss.

Magic is the obvious answer. Elves were the first, they walked the world before any humanoid. In the beginning, there wouldn't be anyone to trade with anyway - it was just elves. So maybe the early elves figured out how to grow metal with magic, and carefully crystalize gemstones from flowers over years, and transmute leaves and vines to dyes, and grow insects that spin not just silk, but cotton and linen and all manner of fabric. 

  

You walk into an elven city, and it isn't oriented around trade and commerce the way human cities are. There are strange trees, and a vaguely feywild feel, and gardens of gemstones just beginning to bud from stalks and bright silk butterflies emerging from cocoons that are spun from silk that is harvested for clothes. 

  

And maybe these things aren't easy to do, so it isn't like elves are secret billionaires, or like dragons with giant hoards of wealth. But they are possible to do, so there is no motivation to trade, really. Maybe in the past, there was more trade, say before the Great War perhaps there was some casual commerce between the elves and Chardon, or the dwarves - not because the elves needed anything but because it was interesting, and new. But now with many of the elves who remain in hiding, it has mostly gone away.

 I think this is not about selling a painting or a book or whatever, it is about  _being_ a painter, or a poet, or whatever.  Just like in the real world, intellectual property doesn't mean that you can't sell a book. It means you can't publish a derivative book. The idea here is that elves take this seriously. Perhaps extending it to magic needs a bit of thought so as to not cut off PC elf wizards, but at the same time, it is pretty easy to make it about the elf. There is no reason it would need to be seen as odd if an elf wizard was happy enough to sell their spell-creations. The idea here is that Delwath would certainly not agonize about selling a book, but if he was publishing a book of poetry he'd be hesitant to make it too similar to someone's existing style. 

I think this idea is worth developing a little bit, but I guess I don't yet have a good sense of the vibe. I like the idea that there is "richer and poorer" in elven society based not on material wealth but on what you create, what new things you bring into the world. But I'm not sure how this fits with strong intellectual property protections, which seem more about enabling capitalism and guaranteeing return on investment. If it is about the value of the artist, couldn't you go the other way and say that elven artists want to be copied, since that proves their worth? If no one imitates you, you don't make a mark on the world, that kind of thing.
