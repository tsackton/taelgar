# Orcs

*[[Thark]], Master of Unbreakable Chains, in your fire we temper this soul. Bind it to your will, so it may never know peace, only the insatiable hunger for strife and turmoil.*
`--` The Blood Binding, excerpt

Scattered across the world of Taelgar small orc bands roam, raiding and pillaging in the name of [[Thark]], the god of war without end. Although most orcs live in small groups, when a leader blessed by [[Thark]] arises, they can bind many orcs together into a fearsome battle horde. 
## Imposing and Violent
Orcs are robust and imposing figures, often standing over 6 feet tall, usually with tusks protruding from their lower lips. Their skin tones range from shades of green to a dull gray, typically with black or red eyes. Most orcs die in battle, but those who manage to survive or who escape [[Thark]]'s chains have lifespans similar to humans, although they mature much quicker than humans. 

Orcs are a decentralized and often chaotic race, driven to violence and conflict by their patron deity, [[Thark]]. Because of this, orcs have a fearsome reputation, and free orcs who have escaped [[Thark]]'s chains often struggle to distinguish themselves from their [[Thark]]-cursed breathren.
## Families and Hordes
Orc communities are generally small. They lack centralized governance, and a group of orcs often extend no further than a large family group. Compelled to violence by [[Thark]], these orc groups frequently fight each other, although they raid settled areas when they can. This constant war, even with high birth rates, usually keeps orc population sizes fairly low. 

However, sometimes a leader blessed by [[Thark]] will unite many small groups together, forming a horde that can number in the hundreds or thousands. These hordes always form under the influence of a strong leader who can turn the violence of individual orcs to external purposes, and usually take on the name of the leader as their identity. These large hordes will often emerge out of marginal lands unexpectedly, threatening the cities and kingdoms of other races. 
## [[Thark]], the God of War Without End
Orcs are tightly bound to, and cursed by, [[Thark]], the embodied god of war without end. Through [[Thark]]'s dominion, orcs are compelled to violence without purpose, war for the sake of war. 

Orcish religion, the manifestation of [[Thark]]'s will in the world, glorifies strength and resolving conflicts through violence. But the real power of [[Thark]]'s curse is enforced by a mysterious rumored ritual known as the Blood Oath of the Crimson Blade. While few details of this ritual are known to non-orcs, it is rumored that this ritual, performed on all newborn orcs, infuses them with the strength and fire of [[Thark]]'s will. Those who cannot or will not accept the curse of [[Thark]] do not survive the ritual.

## Unchained Orcs

Rumors circulate throughout Taelgar of unchained orcs, free orcs that have broken the bounds of [[Thark]]'s curse, and live without the burning fire of [[Thark]]'s divine will driving them to ceaseless violence.

The most famous of these orcs, at least in the western regions of Taelgar, are the [[People of the Rainbow]], living in the deserts east of [[Dunmar]]. 

Free orcs live in the constant shadow of [[Thark]]'s hunters. [[Thark]] watches over his orcs, driving them to fight each other, bringing strength to the victors. But none are more hated by [[Thark]]'s orcs than those who have broken free: any tribe that tries to turn from [[Thark]]'s way is quickly subject to unceasing attacks until they are defeated and subjugated, unless they can find a way to hide from [[Thark]]'s probing eyes.

The Ironwood Clan: Living deep within the Ironwood Forest, these orcs are adept at woodcraft and have become guardians of nature. Having eluded the ritual binding to [[Thark]], they've sought solace in the whispers of the forest and the teachings of an ancient, nature-based faith. They have druidic shamans who perform rituals under great oak trees to celebrate life, growth, and the changing of seasons. Despite their peaceful ways, they are formidable warriors when their lands are threatened.

The Sundered Chain: This community of Free Orcs originated from escaped slaves and gladiators who overthrew their oppressors. Rejecting [[Thark]] and all forms of tyranny, they have formed a commune in the desert wastelands where no one willingly goes. They have a council of elders who were among the first to break their chains, both literal and metaphoric. They are fierce proponents of freedom and will fight to the death to prevent any from suffering under enslavement.

The Nomads of the Misty Vale: These orcs live in the valley mists of a mountain range, where they herd domesticated giant spiders. They broke free from [[Thark]]â€™s influence due to a mysterious event involving the appearance of a strange celestial body visible only from their valley. Their society places great importance on storytelling, with a strong oral tradition that aims to recount every important event, so that future generations never forget the price of freedom. The orcs of this community specialize in weaving silk armor and crafting intricate jewelry from the materials they harvest.
