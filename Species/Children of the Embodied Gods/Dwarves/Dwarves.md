> [!quote] Dwarven Prayer of Naming, excerpt
> *Far under the mountains, long ago the First were made from solid stone. Born to delve and craft and seek, the [[Bahrazel]] made our mountain homes: Uzdan, the Ruler, leader of people; [[Karthel]], the Runecrafter, shaper of magic; [[Fanrukel]], the Priest, keeper of lore; Tarbaka, the Stoneworker, lord of the forge; [[Azar]], the Warrior, defender of cities; Maganna, the Traveler, delver and miner; and Oshkir, the Farmer, provider and healer. May their wisdom and protection guide you to your name and place. See now the past and the future as one.*

Deep in the mountains, a glittering hall of crystal and light, enchanted with glowing runes. The echoes of hammers and picks delving for silver, forging iron and steel; and the slow tap-tap-tap of a crafter carefully shaping a cave of wonder beneath the mountains. Towering stone fortresses in the hills, full of beautiful stonework and ancient runes of power and protection. An abiding commitment to clan and family and thuhr. These are the common threads of dwarven life. 

### Short And Strong

Bold, brave (sometimes to the point of foolhardiness) and hardy, dwarves are renowned for their skill in battle and as artisans of stone and metal. Though dwarves are short and stocky, averaging 4 to 4 ½ feet, and rarely growing taller than 5 feet, their muscular build means they often weight as much as a human 2 feet taller.

Their appearance is as varied as the stones they shape: though many have ruddy complexions, with dark or red hair and brown or tan skin, dwarves of all colors are regularly seen in Taelgar. Most dwarven men, and some dwarven women, grow long beards, which they braid with intricate ribbons. As dwarves age, their hair, including their beards, generally turns gray or white, and their faces acquire deep wrinkles, especially around the eyes.

Dwarves mature at a little more slowly than humans. Dwarves typically reach physical maturity at around the age of 25, but are not considered full adults until they reach their age of majority at 36 and make a pilgrimage to [[Heart of the Mountain]] to receive their name and thuhr. Dwarves have a long lifespan, often reaching 300 years.
### Bound By Tradition

Dwarves can live to be hundreds of years old, and like the mountains of their home they endure change stoically, holding tightly to their long traditions and history. Even dwarves who do not live in their homelands generally honor their ties to their ancestors, and dwarven settlements far from their original homelands nonetheless maintain ties to clan and kingdom.

Many dwarves can recite family histories going back thousands of years, to the early days of the Taelgar, the triumphs and defeats the wars of the first ages of the world, and the bitter memories of the Sundering, when the dwarven race was divided by conflict, and many dwarves left in exile. This long memory gives dwarven society tendency to always be looking backwards; for some dwarves, this becomes a deep nostalgia for the glory days of yore.
### The Bahrâzel

As one of the Elder races of Taelgar, the Dwarves were created by the [[Bahrazel|Bahrâzel]], the embodied gods of the Dwarves and the mystical firstborn of their race. Legend says the seven [[Bahrazel]] were created from living rock, given form and magic and empowered to create the dwarven people in their image. The [[Bahrazel]], the seven gods of the dwarves, play a significant role in dwarven society. They are worshipped as the creators of the dwarven race, and many dwarves will call upon the [[Bahrazel]] in times of stress and danger, with a quick prayer for intercession; they are the patrons and protectors of the race. While they have individual identities, many dwarves worship the [[Bahrazel]] as a whole, thinking of the seven gods as aspects of one divinity. The reality of the [[Bahrazel]] is much debated in dwarven theological circles.

### The Living Mountain

This connection to mountains is expressed most strongly in the home of the [[Bahrazel]], [[Heart of the Mountain]]. [[Heart of the Mountain]] is a mystical place, another plane of existence entirely that most dwarves only experience during the ritual of name-taking, when a young dwarf around the age of maturity goes on a pilgrimage to recieve their adult name and thuhr. There are no maps, and few people find it in the same place, but all dwarves find it eventually, after wandering through the passages of their people and the natural passages beneath the mountains.

[[Heart of the Mountain]] is often describe as a massive hall, formed in the shape of a ribcage, but it changes and reshapes itself so no description is ever exactly the same, and many dwarves find the place hard to describe. It is the incarnation of the stone itself, the place where the mountains are alive. When a dwarf finds the chamber during the ritual of name-taking, they usually experience a vision of a significant moment in their lives, learning their thuhr at the same time. At death, dwarves hope to be returned to [[Heart of the Mountain]] and their name is carved upon the walls of the chamber, to live in the mountains in perpetuity with the [[Bahrazel]].
### Thuhr

All adult dwarves who have completed their naming rite are also a member of a thuhr, a uniquely dwarven institution that is a combination of a guild, a secret society, a mentorship system, and a place to find family outside the traditional strictures of the dwarven clan. There are seven thuhr, each associated with one of the [[Bahrazel]]: Ruler, Runecrafter, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, and Farmer. A dwarves' thuhr is revealed to them during the ritual of name-taking at the age of maturity, when they find [[Heart of the Mountain]] and experience the divine revelation of the [[Bahrazel]].

When a young dwarf learns their thuhr, they will usually apprentice to an elder of the same thuhr to learn a vocation, often traveling far from home for this purpose. The thuhr connect dwarves across clans, and play an important role in keeping dwarven society peaceful and resolving conflicts between clans. Rare Binthuhr dwarves (adults who never completed their pilgrimage to [[Heart of the Mountain]], and thus never learned their thuhr) challenge the strict traditions of the race and are usually outcasts from dwarven society.
#### Slow To Trust

Dwarven kingdoms are generally friendly to other races, but are rarely close allies. They tend to treat “younger” races, especially [[Halflings]] and humans, as valuable members of the kingdom, but generally still as outsiders.

However, dwarven kingdoms are often close allies with the Stoneborn, who share their mountain home and a long history of alliance in battle.

Dwarven kingdoms rarely have extensive relations with elven society. Although dwarves generally treat [[Elves|elves]] as elders due respect, their rulers and diplomats tend to tire of the [[Elves|elves]] haughty attitudes quickly, as dwarves do not see themselves as children of the world.
### Clans, Kings, and Cities

Dwarven society is generally conserative and strongly hierarchical, organized around ties of honor among kin, thuhr, and clan. Family units tend to live close together in large extended families, and any dwarves’ first loyalty is to the matriarch or patriarch of their family. Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep underground, connecting dwarves to the mineral wealth of the mountains that is the source of much of their livelihood and trade. Some dwarven kingdoms spread extensively above ground, reaching into the foothills and valleys of their mountain homes. Members of other races, especially halflings, stoneborn, and humans, often live in these above ground settlements harmoniously, yet are rarely treated as a full part of the community. Despite their close knit societies, many dwarves have chosen to live among humans in their cities, where they are often skilled artisans or sought-after as mercenaries or bodyguards.

In the west of Taelgar, there are five great [[Dwarven Kingdoms]]:

- [[Fahnukan]], in the far north, isolated since before the [[Great War]], the home to strange dwarves who sculpt in ice and relish the cold.
- [[Nidzahar]], the largest and richest of the five kingdoms, building great cities on the mountain slopes as centers of trade and industry, and growing rich of the prosperous trade connections with [[Sembara]] to the east.
- [[Am'khazar]], on the western side of the great mountains, small but proud of their mineral wealth and skill in gem-cutting, especially in their largest city, [[Zarkandur]], the City of Gems.
- [[Khatridun]], a small but ancient kingdom south of [[Nidzahar]] and east of [[Am'khazar]], the remnants of one of the great dwarven empires of the Elder days, now much reduced due to the losses and destruction of the [[Great War]]
- [[Nardith]], far to the south in the [[Yuvanti Mountains]], a new kingdom founded by refugees fleeing the devastation of the [[Great War]] and the old kingdom of [[Ardith]], now growing rich on trade with [[Chardon]] and [[Dunmar]].

#### Dwarven Names
A dwarf’s name is revealed to them when they find the Heart of the Mountain, and holds a deep place in the traditions of clan and caste. All dwarf names are used and reused over centuries and revered down the generations. Young dwarves who have not made their pilgrimage yet (and are thus caste-less and nameless) go by diminutive nicknames given by their parents.  

Dwarves ascribe meaning to their clan names and often render them in the trade tongue when introducing themselves, and thus these clans are presented in English here. This tradition is not universal, and of course some dwarves may introduce themselves with dwarven clan names.

## Notes

Most of this needs to be rewritten based on the new lore in the GMBinder docs, etc.

  


  

Lizardfolk creatures of the water, forest and swamp, masters of dreams and the realm of spirits, skilled as healers, are described here. The D&D mechanics of this race on are on [D&D Beyond.](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/372452-lizardfolk-taelgar)  
  

[Dwarves](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LtFg6GJLYThfAVQlu80) are bold and brave and tradition-bound, as skilled in artistry as in battle, deeply committed to clan and home.

### Religion

  

A few random thoughts about dwarven religion for the Riswynn one-shot.

  

1. I think that the main “idea” of Dwarven religion should be a set of obligations and debts in exchange for power and favors. Should probably feel kind of feudal in nature, with the Bahrazel ultimately the “monarch” and everyone else tied into a web of obligations, responsibilities, rights, and privileges. 

  

The most fundamental of these would be the blessing of the naming rite, becoming part of the dwarven community and accepting the obligations of the Bahrazel, and in return gaining the connection that sustains dwarven racial magic. In this sense, dwarves who never complete the ritual would be seen as variously traitors and deserters, or, more benignly, non-citizens or even non-dwarves. And abandoning your clan, thuhr, and obligations to the Bahrazel after the ritual would be a much, much greater crime than simply never making the exchange in the first place. 

  

The obligations that flow from this exchange would largely be around accepting one’s role in dwarven society, and accepting a kind of communal / socialist ethos, “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”, but restricted, of course, to dwarves alone – the supposed reputation for greed of dwarves would, in this idea, derive largely from outsiders. 

  

2. One implication of this is that many dwarves are probably not particularly religious, in that there isn’t a lot of prayer or holy days. Certainly there are holidays venerating the Bahrazel, but in some parts of dwarven society these would probably have a bit of a “secular” gloss, kind of like nationalist/patriotic holidays – a bit of a “founding fathers” vibe. 

3. Another implication of this is that the Bahrazel don’t really grant prayers in the usual sense, and that typically divine power is accompanied by divine obligation. Unlike many human religions where the gods / divine gain strength through prayer and thus use miracles to sustain faith, the Bahrazel are just the Bahrazel, they don’t get stronger or weaker based on the strength of dwarven belief. 

  

I think, actually, that what this means is that the debt or obligation to the Bahrazel is almost a physical thing, a fragment of dwarven essence, that is passed into the Heart of the Mountain to allow the Bahrazel to reach into the world, and that that trade is in fact necessary for them to operate. Hence the need to travel to the Heart of the Mountain to obtain your name and thuhr and runic power - each dwarf must leave a bit of themselves behind in the divine realm, an obligation to the Bahrazel, and it is that left-behind bit that powers their runic magic. 

  

Metaphysically, I think the idea should be that the embodied gods have more physicality than the incorporeal gods. Thark, of the orcs, is sustained and reaches into the world through the birth ritual that ties the orcs to his power, for example. For the elves there is probably some aspect of the long process of becoming adult that ties to the gods, not in the sense of an obligation (like the dwarves) or a curse (like the orcs) but somehow. 

  

4. Theologically, there should be a lot of debate in dwarven society about the nature of the Bahrazel, are they independent gods, facets of one god, or something else. Many dwarves simply worship them as a collective, for example, giving little thought to the individualistic nature of the seven. 

  

More notes:

  

* I have never thought of the dwarves as having a very ritual or prayer oriented religion, or even really a religion in the human sense. Part of this is an artifact of the fact that I have four dwarven players across our campaign and Isaac’s campaign, none of whom role play any kind of religious affiliation despite two of the being clerics. But I also think it fits my view of dwarves. The Baharzel are like the mountains. You depend on them, they are the foundation of your society and wealth, but you don’t and in some sense can’t have any kind of personal relationship with them. 

  

* That said — the hook for the Riswynn solo was that all the other players were dwarves who had prayed for, and been granted, a miracle, but as a consequence had incurred a debt to the gods they could call in. So I kind of imagine that prayers are almost seen as kind of dangerous. The Baharzel might grant your prayer, but if they do they have power over you. And they can yank you out of your life to serve their purposes. So prayer is what you do when you are truly desperate. 

  

* Related to this, I think is the idea that even for dwarves with some kind of direct relationship with the Baharzel, leveled clerics, that relationship is more of a knight/lord kind of relationship, almost feudal with a sense of reciprocal obligations.  

  

* On top of this, the Baharzel are literally the source of runic magic, which most dwarves can use to some degree. So they are ever-present, but impersonal in a way. I see dwarves as viewing the Baharzel as the kind of glue that holds everything together, that in some sense enforce the debts of honor and obligation that hold dwarven society together. But you don’t really worship glue. 

  

* Dwarven religion, such as it exists, is thus much more of celebration of dwarven history, of dwarven heroes. Unlike say Dunmar, most dwarven holidays are not the feast days for gods but commemoration of heroes from the past, and especially memorials to those fallen. Like, I am sure there are a number of celebrations and days of remembrance and the like around the Great War, and even going back to the first wars of the Downfall. 

  

* That said, ceremonies around birth, the transition to adulthood, and death are explicitly religious. I haven’t thought much about the birth ceremonies, but the ceremony of name-taking is deeply personal, basically a solo quest to find the Heart of the Mountain, which is the plane of the Baharzel. And in death, the hope of any dwarf for their spirit to return with honor to that place and dwell with the firstborn. But I am not sure there is much of a religious rite here — dwarven culture feels to me very strongly in the works over faith camp, and if by the time you die you are doomed to either destruction of your soul entirely or some kind of purgatory, it is too late, no last minute prayer is going to help you. And if the firstborn can lead living dwarves to their domain, of course they can gather spirits. So again I think burial customs would largely be around a celebration and honoring of the person, without a lot of explicitly religious rituals. 

## Dwarf

  
  

Arat created the fourth-born, a race dwelling under the 

mountains, the Dwarves. They were made from the roots of the earth, stoic and enduring, shaped from the solid rock of their homes underground. They were numerous and prosperous, honorable and courageous. Yet even they could not escape Melikor’s influence. He made them set in their ways, honorable yet hidebound, slow to forgive or understand others, and so the race was sundered.

-- Tales of Creation, from the Scrolls of the Divine   

  

Deep in the mountains, a glittering hall of crystal and light, enchanted with glowing runes. The echoes of hammers and picks delving for silver, forging iron and steel; and the slow tap-tap-tap of a crafter carefully shaping a cave of wonder beneath the mountains. Towering stone fortresses in the hills, full of beautiful stonework and ancient runes of power and protection. An abiding commitment to clan and family and caste. These are the common threads of dwarven life.

### Short And Strong

Bold, brave (sometimes to the point of foolhardiness) and hardy, dwarves are renowned for their skill in battle and as artisans of stone and metal. Though dwarves are short and stocky, averaging 4 to 4 ½ feet, and rarely growing taller than 5 feet, their muscular build means they often weight as much as a human 2 feet taller.

They have ruddy complexions, generally dark or red hair, and dark eyes. Dwarven men (and some women) grow long beards, which they braid with intricate ribbons. As dwarves age, their hair, including their beards, begin to gray and turn white, and their faces acquire deep wrinkles, especially around the eyes. Dwarven skin is often very thick and callused, and is usually brown or tan in color.

  

### Bound By Honor And Tradition

Dwarves can live to be hundreds of years old, and like the mountains of their home they endure change stoically, holding tightly to their long traditions and history. Even dwarves who do not live in their homelands deeply honor their ties to their ancestors, stretching back to the original ancestors of the dwarven race (the Bahrâzel, or ‘First-Wisest’, the seven original dwarves, the source of the dwarves power and worshipped as aspects of the Divine).

Many dwarves can recite family histories going back thousands of years, to the early days of the Taelgar, the triumphs and defeats of the Great Orc Wars, and the bitter memories of the Sundering (when the dwarven race was divided by conflict, and many dwarves left in exile and eventually became the gnomes). This long memory gives dwarven society tendency to always be looking backwards; for some dwarves, this becomes a deep nostalgia for the glory days of yore.

Individual dwarves are loyal, true to their word, and typically have a highly developed sense of honor. Dwarves tend to be closed and slow to trust those who are not their friends or kin, but when they do make friends they are friends for life. They are decisive in action, often to the point of stubbornness, but cautious about change. Dwarves also tend toward scrupulously honest in following their code of law: few dwarves will willingly break a dwarven law, whether or not they are in the dwarven kingdom. Those that do and are caught are outcast from dwarven society, and must make their way alone in the world bereft of kin and clan.

### The Living Mountain

Dwarves are one of the Elder races, which means that they are the embodiment of and draw magical power from the mystical founders of their race, the seven Bahrâzel. Dwarves will often call upon the Bahrâzel in times of stress and danger, with a quick prayer for intercession; they are seen as divine saints, patrons, and protectors of the race. The connection dwarves have with the Bahrâzel also allows them to inscribe runes with magical effects. While in most cases these are small, such as mending a broken item, some legendary dwarves can create extraordinary magical items, wards, and marks of power

Dwarves’ connection to the Bahrâzel is also expressed through their belief that they are a living part of the mountains: they are a crucial part of the life cycle of mountains and mountains form a crucial part of their spiritual existence.

The most sacred site in dwarven religion is the Heart of the Mountain, the incarnation of the mountains themselves and thought to be the original mythical home of the Bahrâzel themselves. The ritual that leads to the selection of the caste of a young Dwarf, occurring at the age of physical maturity (around 25) but before the age of majority (36), involves a journey to find the Heart of the Mountain. There are no maps, and few people find it in the same place, but all dwarves find it eventually, after wandering through the passages of their people and the natural passages beneath the mountains.

The Heart of the Mountain is a massive hall, formed in the shape of a ribcage, pulsating and changing so that no description is ever the same. It is the incarnation of the stone itself, the place where the mountains are alive. In the center of the chamber lies a pool of water, eternally still. When a dwarf finds the chamber seeking their caste, they see in the water a reflection of a significant moment in their lives, learning their caste at the same time. At death, dwarves hope to be returned to the Heart of the Mountain and their name is carved upon the walls of the chamber, to live in the mountains in perpetuity.

### Caste and Clan

Dwarven society is strongly hierarchical, and organized around kin, caste, and clan. Family units tend to live close together in large extended families, and any dwarves’ first loyalty is to the matriarch or patriarch of their family. All dwarves are also a member of a caste, which they are born into but which is not revealed until they seek and find the Heart of the Mountain. The seven castes, derived from the natures of the seven Bahrâzel, are Runemaster, Ruler, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, and Farmer.

When a young dwarf learns their caste, they will usually apprentice to an elder of the same caste to learn a vocation, often traveling far from home for this purpose. Caste-ties connect dwarves across clans, and play an important role in keeping dwarven society peaceful and resolving conflicts between clans. Rare casteless dwarves (adults who never completed their pilgrimage to the Heart of the Mountain, and thus never learned their caste) challenge the strict traditions of the race and are usually outcasts from dwarven society.

### Kings and Cities

Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep underground, connecting dwarves to the mineral wealth of the mountains that is the source of much of their livelihood and trade. Some dwarven kingdoms spread extensively above ground, reaching into the foothills and valleys of their mountain homes. Members of other races, especially halflings, stoneborn, and humans, often live in these above ground settlements harmoniously, yet are rarely treated as a full part of the community.

  

Despite their close knit societies, many dwarves have chosen to live among humans in their cities, where they are often skilled artisans and sought-after as mercenaries or bodyguards. These dwarves nonetheless maintain ties of clan and caste, and cherish their dwarven roots.

  

#### Slow To Trust

Dwarves get along with other races, but are rarely close, trusted friends. They tend to view “younger” races, especially halflings and humans, with friendliness but not necessarily much trust.

Dwarves are often close allies with the Stoneborn, who share their mountain home and a long history of battle against orcs.

Dwarves see elves as elders due respect, although they can tire of the elves haughty attitudes quickly, as dwarves do not see themselves as children of the world.

Dwarves and gnomes are long-sundered members of the same originally created race. Living in very different parts of the world, they rarely encounter each other. Dwarves see gnomes has having betrayed the honor of the race, and tend to react with suspicion or distaste when they first meet. Nonetheless, they are distant siblings and for Dwarves kin is everything, and so they cannot bring themselves to hate the Gnomes.

Coming from homes high in the mountains, in kingdoms stretching far underground, many dwarves who venture to the outside world never feel comfortable with wide open spaces, and are particularly wary of boats and the ocean.

### Dwarven Names

A dwarf’s name is revealed to them when they find the Heart of the Mountain, and holds a deep place in the traditions of clan and caste. All dwarf names are used and reused over centuries and revered down the generations. Young dwarves who have not made their pilgrimage yet (and are thus caste-less and nameless) go by diminutive nicknames given by their parents (these names tend to be one syllable and are genderless in Dwarf society).
