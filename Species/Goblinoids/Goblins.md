don't have any real developed notes, but here are some basic vibes. Goblins have featured in an Addermarch adventure [[Addermarch - Session 04]] and in the 3-session mini-adventure I ran for a few folks: [[LL - Session 1]] and [[LL - Session 2]].

From LL:

The basic adventure was infiltrating a ruined manor and defeating a mad alchemist, who had hired goblins as bandits, basically. 
There is one group, led by Folcan (cursespitter) and including the guards at the prison, who are perfectly happy working from Grimstone, think it is easy work and/or like their drink a bit too much. They won't fight to the death, but they won't betray him readily, and will try to sound the alarm.

There is a second group, led by Ulgna (bonesplitter), and including the guards outside the barracks and many of the lackey minions, who hate the hobgoblin, thought they were free of hobgoblins and wanted to live in peace. They are not exactly good people - happy to raid - but would prefer to be raiding on their own. Got caught up in this because Folcan and Ulgna knew each other, and Folcan invited Ulgna to come stay, and now she is afraid to leave. Will be more than happy to run if feels like the party is going to cause enough chaos that Grimstone and his hobgoblin lieutenant won't chase after her. 

Bits of overheard info:
- "Stuck here for a stinking week! Damn that Ulgna! Why does Folcan listen to her in the first place, she doesn't even like working for Grimstone!"
- "Ha, yeah, its the easiest raiding in a while. One prisoner a week and all the brandy we can drink? Even worth putting up with that filthy Krekka. Glad we have Ulgna and her buddies to draw his ire!"
- "It's your fault Morky, shoulda kept your mouth shut about that stupid dog. Grimstone wouldn't care if Ulgna kept it!"
- "At least we've got brandy, and good thing that fool lizardfolk had cards on him! Gives us something to do."
- "Which one of the latest batch should we give to Grimstone when he down in two days? I vote the lizardfolk, he probably eats the most anyway and I don't like the look of him. I bet we can keep that scrawny halfling alive for weeks on stale bread and rotting meat, ha ha."
- "Shut it, you're stalling - place your bet already! And give me more of that brandy."
- "You shut it, you've drunk too much already, this barrel has to last us the week!"

From an adventure I ran that is not necessarily canonical, for work people:

Goblins were the main enemy, but the vibe was they had been peaceful (ish), or at least tolerable - robbing a bit, but generally not hurting people and trying to avoid killing - until a local hobgoblin boss showed up, took over the group, and set them up as a much more violent force. 

From Addermarch:

Basic adventure was to inflitrate a goblin lair and recover an alchemical recipe for [[Caradoc]]. Goblin vibe was kind of bumbling bandits.

Overall:

- Basic vibe is not too dissimilar from, e.g. traditional Forgotten Realms goblin lore; small/weak/greedy, usually bullied by bigger goblinoids, especially hobgoblins, etc. 
- Although not convinced they should be a playable race, the basic vibe is much more sympathetic than e.g. hobgoblins or bugbears. I could see, for example, some goblins being greedy enough to sneakily help humans during the hobgoblin occupations in Sembara -- for money, of course. Or maybe just to stick it to their hobgoblin masters. 
- I think the vibe is supposed to be that most goblins in the world make up the underclass in hobgoblin camps and cities. Some small groups get away, and often live at the margins of human society. Some take up banditry, but others just want to be left alone. That said their reputation is not great in human communities, although potentially it is better in places where hobgoblins have been present in living memory.
