# Goblinoids

%%
Added some questions and notes throughout

i could not find any shared notes specific to goblinoids - mostly discussion of hobgoblins %%

%% notes

- Created by the Void Mind; hobgoblins are supposed to be like humans but lack the divine spark. instead of being endowed with the power to create things from belief they are endowed with the belief they are superior or something like that. the point is these are the Taelgar Nazi Party basically, the bad guys you can always safely fight without feeling guilty. 
	- Haven't decided yet whether, like the orcs, they have a way to escape this evil destiny
- The Void Mind also created the [[Goblins]], to be their servants and slaves, and the bugbears, to be their warriors. 
	- [[Goblins]] are probably the most "sympathetic" of the goblinoids; probably seen equally with pity and scorn if they escape. you could imagine some [[Goblins]] living happy quiet lives far from anyone, others imitating their hobgoblin masters if they get free, others serving as pawns, intentionally or not, in hobgoblin games
		- The work one-shot I ran (questionably canon) followed this, a local goblin tribe was not really much of a nuisance until a hobgoblin leader showed up and took over
	- Bugbears I'm not sure about

Thoughts from Mike:
* Are bugbears necessarily canonical? I see they came up in one or two Great Library arcs but could that be retconned to particularly fearsome hobgoblins, or something in the ogre/troll family, i.e. more like a monster and not a real species per se?
* Hobgoblins have a very well-developed vibe that appears to be fairly unique and interesting, although not well captured on this page. 
* Goblins clearly exist - they've been used, I believe, in several canonical games, although I'm not sure if they came up in Dunmar Frontier. I haven't used them in Cleenseau but I believe they've been mentioned in backstory.
* Is it necessary to have bugbears at all? They seem to be an odd fit and not mentioned much. Could they been some mad experienment of mixing hobgoblins with bears or something, that just happened once, if needed?
* Are goblins actually hobgoblin servants and slaves? Any thoughts on whether they are actually fey instead?

In my conception of hobgoblins, goblins have never come up,, nor can I remember them coming up in any Dunmar frontier arc, i.e. the Empress of Chaos didn't appear to have goblin slaves hanging around the army camp, etc. Are we sure they are hobgoblin slaves not something else?
