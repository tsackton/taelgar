# Goblinoids

%% notes

- Created by the Void Mind; hobgoblins are supposed to be like humans but lack the divine spark. instead of being endowed with the power to create things from belief they are endowed with the belief they are superior or something like that. the point is these are the Taelgar Nazi Party basically, the bad guys you can always safely fight without feeling guilty. 
	- Haven't decided yet whether, like the orcs, they have a way to escape this evil destiny
- The Void Mind also created the goblins, to be their servants and slaves, and the bugbears, to be their warriors. 
	- Goblins are probably the most "sympathetic" of the goblinoids; probably seen equally with pity and scorn if they escape. you could imagine some goblins living happy quiet lives far from anyone, others imitating their hobgoblin masters if they get free, others serving as pawns, intentionally or not, in hobgoblin games
		- The work one-shot I ran (questionably canon) followed this, a local goblin tribe was not really much of a nuisance until a hobgoblin leader showed up and took over
	- Bugbears I'm not sure about
