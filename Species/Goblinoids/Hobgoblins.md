%%
I have some DM folder notes about hobgoblin tactics and such that might contribute to the vibe but are perhaps more specific to shattered ice and similar specific clans - tagging Mike until I get a chance to review 

should capture some vibes based details from various discussions and backlinks and history before marking page complete

notes from Discord

one other thing about hobgoblins - while I think in context it makes sense that they would have put the people of Cleenseau to death given the strategic location as a beachhead, I think of hobgoblins more as authoritarian dictators and slavers than just mindless brutality, and also having enough strategic foresight to balance a reputation for brutality. for example perhap they slaughter anyone who resists, but towns that surrender are taxed, and perhaps some are enslaved, but allowed to escape with relatively little death. and also I guess for hobgoblins taxes and enslavement might not be far off - maybe it is something like they believe that humans naturally owe hobgoblins the products of their labor, so when they govern a place they order people what to do and take what they need of the product. and there is no freedom of movement, or anything. but this isn't chattel slavery, particularly. and of course they recognize that people need food to live and productivity is lower if the population is starving/cold, so living under hobgoblin rule is usually grueling and unpleasant, but not particularly deadly as long as you follow the rules and do what you're told
