# Unusual Species

%% tagging cleanup/incomplete as a reminder to add a sentence about centaurs and and a sentence about kobolds here %%

Not every sentient species in Taelgar has a simple origin story. 

In ages past, cracks in the fabric of reality allowed alien creatures from the Far Realm to slip into the world, with unfathomable goals and strange minds. The most famous of these Creatures of the [[Far Realms]] are the [[Ithilids]], the mind flayers, who live deep underground and occasionally emerge to threaten the surface dwellers, always in search of brains to consume and sentient beings to enslave. 

Around the shores of the [[Green Sea]], occasional rumors can be heard of [[Gnomes]], the surface-dwelling cousins of dwarves, tinkerers and traders, though few will confirm to having seen one in person. 

The flying [[Kenku]] of the north rarely speak of their history or origins to outsiders, but can often be seen soaring over the cities on the shores of the [[Green Sea]]. 

Many sailors claim to have seen the aquatic [[Merfolk]], or their semi-aquatic cousins who dwell in swamps and rivers. But reliable reports are difficult to come by. 

All of these species -- and others, not yet described -- share an unusual history, with origin stories that may not match the typical creation myths of other sentient beings on Taelgar.

# Children of the Riving

In the early days of myth and wonder, before the multiverse was fixed in form, great beings of magical energy endlessly shaped and reshaped the land. When the [[Divine Presence]] sundered the planes, the echoes of the Riving rippled across the Multiverse, creating the Children of the Riving. 

Whether these are the forms of great wyrms and titans that strode across the lands of magic in days of myth frozen and altered by the Riving or the dreams of magical beings or even of magic itself, or something stranger, none can say. 

Nonetheless, the [[Dragons]], [[Fey]], [[Elementals]], and [[Giants]] trace their ancestry in some form or another to the great magical powers of the Age of Myth. 

Since the long pause when the planes of existence were fully separated from the material plane, the [[Fey]] have mostly made their home in the [[Feywild]], while the [[Elementals]] make their home in the [[Energy Realms]]. The [[Giants]] and [[Dragons]] apparently still linger on Taelgar, although whether they also have established strongholds on other planes is the subject of much debate and speculation.
