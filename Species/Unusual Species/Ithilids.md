# Illithids

Aberrations from the Far Realm. 

%%
Notes from old emails:
So far my idea is that they are really alien, far realm types per standard D&D lore, which I intepret to mean their motivations should be hard to fathom / nonsensical.   
  
They eat brains, so need a ready supply of slaves, which drives some of their conflict with surface races, dwarves, etc.   
  
But they also don't need to have 'standard' motives. Maybe they like the feeling of sensing the emotions of loss and death and pain coming from humans and don't really see them as conscious beings, and so destroy them as like a gourmet delicacy.  
  
And of course not all mind flayers have same motives. Some are more connected to building power, amassing slaves, others to more esoteric ends.

One thing I do know about them is that they are well known as a slaver race. Slavery is super rare in Taelgar because the gods dislike it, so Elder races basically can't be slavers and human societies that condone slavery lose the protection of the gods, which rarely goes well unless they can find other gods. Still working on details exactly but I want slavery to be a clear marker of 'this is a group of bad guys you can kill without feeling guilty'.
