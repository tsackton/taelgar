Natives of the Outer Realms, often called the Children of Creation or Children of Belief are the native inhabitants of the Spiritual Realms.

Fiends, including [[Devils]] and [[Demons]] inhabit the [[Nine Hells]] and the [[Abyss]]. 

[[Celestials]] typically spring from the divine realms of gods, such as [[Arkaash]] of the [[Five Siblings|Dunmari gods]] or the [[Heart of the Mountain]] of the [[Bahrazel]].

The [[Gidari]] are the guardians of the [[Land of the Dead]], the guides that protect the souls of the recently deceased as they await their ultimate fate.
