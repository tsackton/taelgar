# Humans

Humans are one of the younger races in Taelgar, late to arrive and make their mark, and shorter lived than the Elder races. Yet, they spread like wildfire, full of drive and ambition. Humans are by far the most numerous inhabitants in the lands of Taelgar, building mighty empires, trading across vast distances, and settling in every corner of the land. Unlike most other races in Taelgar, humans do not have a special connection to any part of the land; without a homeland, they make their home everywhere.
