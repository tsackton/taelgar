# Gidari

The Gidari are strange creatures, rarely encountered by mortals, but frequently described by those who return from death. 

They are the guardians of the [[Land of the Dead]], the neutral ground where the souls of dead mortals await their fate, and the shepherds of the newly deceased as they traverse the [[Land of the Dead]] to their ultimate fate. 

Gidari take no sides in the conflicts over mortal souls, but are the implacable enemies of those would violate the sanctity of dead souls.
