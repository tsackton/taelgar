%% Cleaned up page a bit %%

This page categorizes known-to-exist extra-planar languages, and includes some notes on the details. See [[Languages]] for more general coverage of this topic, including background, open questions, etc.

Note: Any language that is often learned by PCs should be moved to the main [[Languages]] page once canonical details have been established and linked from here.

   * **Sylvan:** Fully canonical. (See [[Languages#Sylvan]])
   * **Shadowkar:** The language of the [[Shadowfolds]]. Unclear canonical details, although Delwath speaks it. Might be related to undead in some fashion.
   * **Primordial:** The four related languages of the elemental planes (**Aquan**, **Auran**, **Terran**, **Ignan** for the planes of water, air, earth, and fire respectively). Unclear if there are really 4, or actually 1, or more than 4, but some players do speak this language. 
   * **Abyssal:**  The language of the chaotic demons of the Abyss. Canonically exists but details ill-defined.
   * **Infernal:** The language of devils and others native to the Nine Hells.  Canonically exists but details ill-defined.
   * **Celestial:** The language of the divine and all the creatures native to the Divine Realms. Typically learned most easily by those with divine magic as it is related to the divine words that bring prayers to the gods and create miracles. Details are of unclear canon.
