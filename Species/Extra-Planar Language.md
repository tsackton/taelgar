%% see note about Shadowkar. with the changing details of the Shadowfell / Shadowfolds the connection between the realm Delwath was trapped in and the Shadowfolds is tenuous as is the existence of a specific "Shadowfell Language"; however the only canonical details are this is somehow a language associated with that particular realm Delwath and Yezali were trapped in. Maybe Shadowkar is the language of Cha'mutte's magic or something. %%

This page categorizes known-to-exist extra-planar languages, and includes some notes on the details. See [[Languages]] for more general coverage of this topic, including background, open questions, etc.

Note: Any language that is often learned by PCs should be moved to the main [[Languages]] page once canonical details have been established and linked from here.

   * **Sylvan:** Fully canonical. (See [[Languages#Sylvan]])
   * **Primordial:** The four related languages of the elemental planes (**Aquan**, **Auran**, **Terran**, **Ignan** for the planes of water, air, earth, and fire respectively). Canonical, although unclear if there are only four dialects, or may possibly be more. (See [[Languages#Primordial]])
   * **Shadowkar:** The language of the [[Shadowfolds]]. Unclear canonical details, although Delwath speaks it. Might be related to undead in some fashion.

%% canonically, Shadowkar is the language that [[Yezali]] somehow learned while trapped in Cha'mutte's shadow dimension, and then taught to Delwath as they bonded. In an early conception of the Shadowfell in Taelgar, Cha'mutte's extradimensional spaces were conceived of as Shadowfell domains, but whether this still makes sense is unclear and this detail was never introduced in game. %%

   * **Abyssal:**  The language of the chaotic demons of the Abyss. Canonically exists but details ill-defined.
   * **Infernal:** The language of devils and others native to the Nine Hells. Canonically exists but details ill-defined.
   * **Celestial:** The language of the divine and all the creatures native to the Divine Realms. Typically learned most easily by those with divine magic as it is related to the divine words that bring prayers to the gods and create miracles. Canonically exists, but details are ill-defined and specifics may not be canonical.
