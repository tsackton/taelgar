%% there is a lot of discord discussion about language families. most has, i believe, been incorporated below, so maybe status/cleanup/external is unnecessary. might be worth keeping a note at the top to indicate there are reasons for some decisions below in external notes, if we don't want to try to copy the whole discussion. %%

   * **Sylvan:** The language of the Feywild, of satyrs and fairies and others. The most common extraplanar language to be learned by natives of the material plane. This is often mapped to classical Greek, but many different real world mappings are possible. 
   * **Shadowkar:** The language of the Shadowfell.
   * **Primordial:** The four related languages of the elemental planes (**Aquan**, **Auran**, **Terran**, **Ignan** for the planes of water, air, earth, and fire respectively).
   * **Abyssal:**  The language of the chaotic demons of the Abyss
   * **Infernal:** The language of devils and others native to the Nine Hells
   * **Celestial:** The language of the divine and all the creatures native to the Divine Realms.


%% notes on rarity, not canon
- Sylvan is by far the most common these for people to learn
- Primordial is second and is often learned by those who are connected in some way to elementals, such as summoners, druids, or others of this nature. 
- Celestial is typically learned most easily by those with divine magic as it is related to the divine words that bring prayers to the gods and create miracles
- Infernal, Abyssal, and Shadowkar are somewhat ill-defined, although Shadowkar at least is likely in some way the Shadowfell equivalent of Sylvan, and may be related to undead in some manner. 
- Left very unclear is whether there are languages of other extra-planar realms, e.g. places like Arborea, Pandemonium, LImbo, and Mechanus and whatever else might exist as the "fundamental planes of raw emotion, curses, etc from the early days of humanity"
