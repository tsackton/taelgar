# Gidari
*(gih-DAR-ee)*

The Gidari are strange creatures, rarely encountered by mortals, but frequently described by those who return from death. 

They are the guardians of the [[Land of the Dead]], the neutral ground where the souls of dead mortals await their fate, and the shepherds of the newly deceased as they traverse the [[Land of the Dead]] to their ultimate fate. 

Giradi are the guardians, protectors, and guides of souls while they traverse the [[Land of the Dead]]. They make sure that these souls reach their destination beyond the veil, and they prevent interference with the journey of souls. While Gidari take no sides in the conflicts over mortal souls, they are implacable enemies of those would violate the sanctity of dead souls.

Some notes moved from the [[Metaphysics of Souls]] page that would be ideal to eventually capture in a perfected version of this page:

* These shepherds enforce rules, and are the ones who prevent, say, demon lords from just camping out in the [[Land of the Dead]] and consuming souls as they flow past. 
* Some cultures might see them as celestials, representatives of the gods, although the reality is more complicated. 
* Other cultures are completely unaware of their existence.
