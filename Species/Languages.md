# LanguagesÂ 
Languages in the world of Taelgar are diverse, and yet the binding influence of magic and the gods have kept them from diverging too far apart. 
## Brief Linguistic History of Taelgar
The common languages of Taelgar spoken by [[Humans|humans]] and the [[Elder Folk]] all derive from the original languages spoken by the first of each species to awaken. For [[Dwarves|dwarves]], [[Elves|elves]], [[Halflings|halflings]], [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]], and [[Lizardfolk|lizardfolk]] this original language has not changed since the dawn of time. For humans, the original tongue has been split and fractured into different language families over the long history of human settlement in Taelgar.

The history of the languages of other sentient creatures is less well known by scholars, but in most cases, whether due to magic, culture, or other factors, linguistic diversity within species is rare. 
## Human Language Families
The human tongues of the known world are broadly divided up into three major language families based on ancient migrations and cultural divisions on the original human homeland of [[Hkar]]:

* **Northros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken across the northern reaches of Taelgar, named Northros by Drankorian cataloguers of languages. These languages are spoken by the cultures that departed Hkar in the ancient days.
* **Eastros Language Family**: A set of languages spoken primarily across the eastern parts of the [[Green Sea]], as far west as [[Skaerhem|Skaer]]. This language is derived from an ancient mariner culture that originally settled much of the [[Green Sea]] region, and these languages were given the name Eastros by Drankorian scholars.
* **Drankorian Language Family**: A set of languages spoken by [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and its successor cultures. It is derived from the language spoken on [[Hkar]] and the time of the [[The Downfall|Downfall]].

There are some other human languages, notably Dunmari, that do not fit into any of the language familes above, and there are rumors and fragments from Drankor of other languages spoken in the far east or far south, which may not fit into these categories as well.

%% Background Note:
This section is intended to be both canonical and sufficiently vague as to not block new invention. Broadly, the assumption is that each of the [[Human Cultures of Taelgar|migrations from Hkar]] map to a specific language family:
* Early Explorers = Northros
* Pre-Urban Exodus = undefined southern tongue
* Mariner Migration = Eastros
* Downfall Refugees = Drankorian

Where the minor migrations, such as the Dunmari, would have potentially unique histories, and may or may not fit into one of the language families above, 

When determining real-world language analogues:
* Northos in general uses Semitic languages
* Eastros and any subsequent migration use Indo-European languages, with Eastros tending towards Slavic/Germanic, and Drankorian tending towards Italic/Hellenic. Other migrations (i.e. Dunmari) that are after the mariner migration should probably be their own branches of the Indo-European language family.
* The Pre-Urban exodus is explicitly undefined, and could be Indo-European or something else

Non-Human tongues should generally avoid Indo-European or Semitic, to maintain distinctness but this is not a hard-and-fast rule.

## Trade Languages
Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. Many non-human creatures also know trade languages, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. Trade tongues are best thought of as pidgins, and they rarely allow for the full nuance of a native tongue. There are two trade tongues in common usage:

- **Common**: An ancient trade tongue derived from the original language of humans, it is commonly used by non-humans, especially halflings to conduct business and trade, and is widely spoken by traders and travelers, across the lands that were once part of the Drankorian Empire.
- **Eastros**: A trade tongue derived from the languages of the Eastros language family, it is widely spoken in the eastern Green Sea, and can be heard as far west as Tollen and Cymea, and even occasionally in the port cities of Sembara. It is very rare outside the Green Sea region.

%% 
Background Note: ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ developed as a separate tongue from Common primarily because of the mariner's explicit cultural rejection of the Hkaran elite, who spoke the language Common is derived from. Eastros is in turn a remanent/pidgin derived from the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~. Halfling telepathy and long-lived non-humans are the primary mechanisms that prevents linguistic drift of these trade tongues. 

Common could reasonably be spoken as a trade pidgin anywhere, and human populations where common is rare, or where a different trade pidgin is spoken, should have an explanation.
%%
## Drankorian Language Family
These are languages that derive from Drankorian, and are the native tongues of most of the lands that were once part of the Drankorian Empire. All Drankorian languages are written using the Drankorian alphabet.

After the fall of the Drankorian Empire, the Drankorian language developed into three main languages: Sembaran, proto-Cymean, and proto-Chardonian. The modern languages of Isinguese and Cymean are still somewhat mutually comprehensible, as are the modern languages of Chardonian and Illorian.

_Real world analog: Drankorian and its language family is broadly based on Hellenic and Romance languages, with some small variations_

* **Drankorian**: The ancient language of Drankor, it is not commonly spoken anymore, although it is still a common scholarly tongue. Drankorian words are usually based on classic Latin or Greek.
* **Sembaran**: A number of mutually understandable related languages and dialects spoken in Sembara and Addermarch, but with a heavy influence from Old Tollish, and Zimkovan. Southern Sembaran is more purely Drankorian, and tends to use French-derived words, whereas northern Sembaran tends to use English. Mutually understandable with Tollish and in some cases, Isinguese. 
* **Chardonian**: A number of mutually understandable related languages and dialects spoken in the Chardonian Empire and its sphere of influence. Mostly derived from Drankorian, but with some loan words from Northros languages. Self-consciously seen as the inheritors of the Drankorian language, and sometimes has similar sounds. Tends to use Latin or Italian, with the occasional "classical" Greek. 
* **Cymean**: A number of mutually understandable related languages and dialects spoken in the Cymean peninsula. Cymean words are usually based on Spanish or Portugese, but with some Italian. It is usually understood by speakers of Isinguese. 
* **Isinguese:** The language spoken in the now destroyed lands of the Istabor Alliance, but still spoken in some of the refugee communities including the [[Duchy of Maseau]] and the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]]. Based on Spanish or French, and is usually understood by speakers of Sembaran (especially southern Sembarans) or Cymean. 
* **Illorian**: The language spoken on the islands of [[Illoria]], it is often understandable to Chardonian speakers, especially those from the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]] or [[Chardon]] itself. No defined real world mapping yet.
* **~Northern Dialects~**: A set of now-almost extinct languages spoken before the Great War in a number of now destroyed northern realms, mostly based along the [[Chasa River Valley]]. These languages were usually understood by speakers of Chardonian, and are based on Italian.

%% Background Note:
This is likely a complete list of currently spoken Drankorian Family languages, although most of these languages are best thought of as collections of mutually comprehensible dialects. It is not clear what the pre-Great War northern realms spoke, but it could be either Drankorian, or some blended Drankorian-Northros language. 
%%
## Northros Language Family
These languages derive from the ancient tongues that were spoken by the first human migrants from [[Hkar]]. They use a diverse set of alphabets.

_Real world analog: Northros languages are based on Semitic languages_

* **Mawar**an: The language spoken by the people of the Mawar penisula, with many loan words from Chardonian and written using the Drankorian alphabet. Mawaran words tend to be based on Arabic.
* **Deno'qai**: The language spoken by the Deno'qai tribes. Written using a unique alphabet derived from Elvish. Deno'qai words tend to be based on Hebrew or Arabic.
* **Old Zimkovan**: The language of the original inhabitants of the Sembaran higlands, still spoken in parts of Zimkova. Written using an alphabet derived from Dwarven, and with a number of loan words from Old Tollish. Zimkovan words tend to based on Maltese, although there are numerous Slavic loan words. 
* **Valgardi**: A language spoken by the [[Vargaldi]], although with many loan words from Eastros languages. Written using the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ alphabet. No specific defined real world analog, although many Varlgardi names are Slavic due to the influence of the Eastros language families. 

%% Background Note:
There are numerous undeveloped cultures and partially developed cultures that likely speak a Northros language. This list should not be considered complete
%%

## Eastros Language Family
All languages in the Eastros language family derive from ~Unnamed Mariner Language~, the language spoken by the ancient seafaring culture that originally settled the eastern parts of the Green Sea. They mostly use the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ alphabet.

_Real world analog: Eastros languages are based on Germanic, Scandanavian, and Balto-Slavic languages_

* **Skaegish**: The language spoken on the Skaer islands. It is similar to Vosic and often speakers of Skaegish understand Vosic and vice versa. Skaegish words are generally Finnish or Norwegian, although other Swedish and Slavic languages fit as well. Written using the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ alphabet.
* **Tollish**: The language spoken in Tollen and parts of the Vostok coast, it is mutually comprehensible with Sembaran. Tollish words are generally based on English or German. It is written with the Drankorian alphabet.
* **Old Tollish**: The ancient language of Tollen and the Vostok and Sembaran coasts. A precursor tongue to both Skaegish, Tollish and Vosic, it is extremely rarely spoken today. Written using the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~. There is no specific real world mapping, but Old Tollish words would usually be Germanic or Slavic. 
* **Zimkovan**: A group of related dialetics spoken in the highland kingdoms of [[Ardlas]], [[Breva]], and [[Lavnoch]]. It is commonly spoken in the rest of Zimkova as well. Real world mapping: Baltic (Lithuanian or Latvian), although with some loan words from Maltese. Written using the Drankorian alphabet. 
* **Urskan**: The language of the closed realm of Ursk. It is written using the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ alphabet, and is rarely spoken outside of Ursk. Urskan words are based on Russian.
* **Vosic**: A group of related dialectics spoken by the Vos people, especially in the northern parts of Vostok. Vosic speakers can often understand Skaegish. Vosic words are generally Slavic. Written using the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ alphabet.
* **~Unnamed Mariner Language~**: The ancient language of the mariner culture than left Hkar for the eastern Green Sea, it is extremely rare to find it still spoken today. 

%% Background Note: 
There clearly are more languages spoken here, i.e. in Medju, Irrla, MTP, the weird islands, etc. This list should not be considered complete
%%

## Miscellaneous Languages
These languages are not well-classified into existing language families, usually because they are based on blended influences from multiple language families, or because they sit outside the main families. The alphabets and real world analogues of these languages are 

* **Dunmari**: The language spoken by the Dunmari, it is related to both Drankorian and the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~. It is written using the Drankorian alphabet. Dunmari words are usually Hindi, but with other Indo-Iranian influences such as Persian.
* **Tyrwinghan**: The ancient language of Tyrwingha, still spoken by many Tyrwinghans especially in rural areas. Its exact language family is not clear, but it is written using the ~Unnamed Mariner Language~ alphabet, although many Tyrwinghans would say it is written using the Tyrwinghan alphabet. Tyrwinghan words are based on Welsh.
* **Hkaran**: The original human language, it still survives in a modified form in Common, but is otherwise no longer known to be spoken. Extremely rarely known in the modern day. It uses the Hkaran alphabet. 

%% Background Notes
Dunmari is Indo-Iranian as a distinct but related language family to Eastros and Drankorian, given it developed by migrants who left Hkar after the mariners but before the Downfall. 

Tyrwinghan is intentionally vague as the exact cultural derivation of the ancient Tyrwinghans is undefined.

## Non-Human Languages
There are many diverse languages amongst the non-human inhabitants of Taelgar, but with the chief exception of the goblinoids, it is rare for any given non-human species to speak more than one language. Some of these languages are commonly learned by outsiders, while others are rare, magical, or mythical. These languages are at least sometimes learned by outsiders, and in some cases, such as lizardfolk and dwarvish, there are many non-native speakers.  

* **Dwarvish:** The language of the dwarves, uses a runic script, often learned by outsiders and traders who want to engage in commerce with the dwarven kingdoms. The dwarven language has remained essentially unchanged since the dawn of time, and so no other dialects of dwarven exist. Real world mapping: Tolkien Dwarvish
* 
%% Background Note: Gnomish is a separate dialectic of Dwarvish, but not commonly known to exist.  %%

* **Elvish:** The language of the elves, and often associated with magic. The term "elvish" encompasses several different languages and variants of the language. Although all elves learn all the variants during their childhood, most outsiders will only understand a subset of elvish. It is frequently learned by scholars of magic or history, and is written using the Elvish alphabet. Real world mapping: Tolkien elvish. 
* **Lizarding:** The language of the lizardfolk. Often learned by those who spend time living in lizardfolk communities. Although there are numerous dialectics, they are all mutually comprehensible. Lizardling is written using local alphabets such as Drankorian, or sometimes, elvish. Real world mapping: Basque
* **Stoneborn**: The language of the Stoneborn. Often learned by those who spend time in Stoneborn communities. There are no known variants or dialectics. The stoneborn have adopted a runic alphabet derived from Giant for their language. Real world mapping: Xhosan.
* **Orcish:** The language gifted to the orcs by Thark, the God of War. While few outsiders speak this language or understand its unique alphabet, those who would engage with orcs in combat or negotiation (to the extent such a thing is possible) do sometimes find a way to learn this tongue. Orcish words are usually Turkic.
%%^Campaign:dufr%%
* **Free Orcish**: The [[People of the Rainbow]] speak a dialect of Orcish that although based on Orcish, has numerous additional words. Although most speakers of Orcish can communicate with the People of the Rainbow, their orcish dialect is not always understandable to those who only know traditional orcish. 
%%^End%%

* **Goblin:** A term for a large number of related languages spoken by hobgoblins and their slaves and allies. Hobgoblin clans often invent secret languages for themselves, but a common creole, derived from the language spoken by Cha'mutte's armies, is often spoken by hobgoblins and goblins, and is usually what is meant when a non-goblin learns the goblin language. This language uses Hungarian words, but other hobgoblin languages may have diverse real world mappings. 
* **Giant:** The language created by the elder titans of old, and now spoken by the giants and their descendants. Often learned by scholars, or traders who would venture to giant settlements. Commonly learned by dwarves, especially those of the Sentinels. Real world mapping: Old Norse. 
* **Halfing:** The secretive and rarely taught language of the halflings, made even more difficult for outsiders to learn given the expectation that speakers of this language will use telepathic cues for emphasis.  The halflings' language is preserved and learned via the racial consciousness; a single dialect covers all halflings across the world, even on diverse continents. The halflings rarely, if ever, teach their secretive language to outsiders. As far as outsiders know, there is no written form of halfling. Real world mapping: considering Igbo.
* **Centaur:** The language of centaurs. Uses the Elvish alphabet. Rarely, but not never, taught to outsiders. Most centaurs speak Elvish, Sylvan, or both in addition to their own tongue, and most outsiders who must speak with them do so in one of those tongues. Real world mapping: mostly Greek, but flexible.
* **Kenku**: Used vaguely Sioux for eastern islands Kenku, but does not need to reflect all kenku.

### Exotic Languages
Many other creatures in the world of Taelgar speak a language of their own, including many of the unusual or rarer races in the world. These might include the strange language of clicks and hisses the **Giant Eagles** speak, or the strange demonic-influenced barking tongue of **Gnolls.** Most of these are difficult, if not impossible, to learn to speak without magic (and few have a written alphabet).

* **Draconic:** The language of dragons. Few learn the pure, **High Draconic** tongue of the ancient wyrms of old, although it is said to be a powerful language of magic. More commonly heard in Taelgar is **Low Draconic**, the native tongue of kobolds and lesser dragons. The nuances and magical power of High Draconic is usually lost on those who only know Low Draconic, although they are usually mutually comprehensible for basic communication. 
* **Deep Speech:** This language is more a rumor than a known fact, but is suspected to be the tongue of the alien aberrations of the underdark, notably the mind flayers, their slaves and the twisted creations. Difficult to learn.
* **Gnoll**: a hideous combination of Abyssal and a magical beast tongue of hyenas; can attempt to understand if you speak Abyssal
* **Bullywug**: spoken by bullywugs mostly
* **Grell**: a corrupted form of Deep Speech

### Extra-Planar Languages
Time and space do not work on the other planes as they do on the material plane, and each plane tends to be represented by a single language. These are typically difficult, although not impossible, for outsiders to learn.

   * **Sylvan:** The language of the Feywild, of satyrs and fairies and others. The most common extraplanar language to be learned by natives of the material plane. This is often mapped to classical Greek, but many different real world mappings are possible. 
   * **Shadowkar:** The language of the Shadowfell.
   * **Primordial:** The four related languages of the elemental planes (**Aquan**, **Auran**, **Terran**, **Ignan** for the planes of water, air, earth, and fire respectively).
   * **Abyssal:**  The language of the chaotic demons of the Abyss
   * **Infernal:** The language of devils and others native to the Nine Hells
   * **Celestial:** The language of the divine and all the creatures native to the Divine Realms.
