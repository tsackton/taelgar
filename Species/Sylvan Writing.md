Raw notes from Discord, needs cleanup.

- The fey invent the language Sylvan, and the corresponding complex logo-syllabic script, during the mythic age, primarily as an art form, used to write poetry, songs, and stories. The script itself encodes this concern: it uses magical/emotional determinatives to communicate the emotional state of the writer, which changes the meaning of glyphs and as a secondary effect has a magical enchantment effect that is weaker or stronger depending on the magical power of the writer
- When Elmerica creates the elves, they *(actually not entirely sure about the gender or lack thereof of the Elven firstborn) also give the elves language (Elvish), and a writing system (the Elvish script), that is derived from the Sylvan script, but converted to a syllabary and stripped of the magical determinatives. The reasons for using the Sylvan script, as opposed to just invented something out of thin air, are left undetermined for the moment, just matters that this is what happened.
- Over time, as the fey begin to interact with other people (non-fey), a few changes happen. First, the fey decide that sometimes writing is useful for things other than art, and that sometimes the magical weight of the fey script is not actually desirable. Second, some non-fey learn the Sylvan tongue (especially, early on, elves), but do not know how, or are not able, to write in the Sylvan script. This leads to the rapid development of an orthography for expressing Sylvan in the Elvish script
- The fey also, around this time, start to learn other languages. Sometimes they just write in the other language's script, but they also rapidly adapt the Sylvan script to other spoken languages, and the magic of the enchantment generally carries the meaning well enough

this leads to the following modern day things:
- the Sylvan language, spoken by the fey, and written in either the (magical) sylvan script, or more typically in the Elvish script. most people who speak sylvan (or, anyway, most non-fey) cannot write in the sylvan script, but can read sylvan in both sylvan and elvish scripts, and write sylvan in elvish. The orthography of writing Sylvan in Elvish was largely invented by the elves as a way to write Sylvan, but functionally adopted by many fey, and probably involved some back and forth and probably is not totally standardized (e.g., like medieval english spelling), but for game-mechanical purposes this is probably irrelevant.
- the Sylvan script, originally used for writing the Sylvan language but since adapted to many other languages, which carries emotive weight, potential magic, and wants to be read so is usually understandable to speakers of the language
- the Elvish script, which is derived via Elmerica's intervention from the Sylvan script, was originally used to write Elvish, but is also the typical script that non-fey use to write Sylvan

left undecided / open to feedback:
- is there an orthography of writing/reading sylvan in other scripts, that is does somewho who knows Sylvan automatically also know the Elvish script, or would they typically write Sylvan transliterated to e.g. Drankorian or Eastros alphabets? I'm fairly open either way to this. There are plenty of examples of real-world languages written in multiple scripts so totally plausible either way. I think the fey would never use anything other than Sylvan or Elvish scripts for written communication among themselves, though. However, a fey who wanted to write a message to a Tyrwinghan human could plausibly write Sylvan (in Sylvan, or Elvish, or Drankorian script, depending on their goals); write in Tyrwinghan or Common or Sembaran, using the standard alphabet; or write in Tyrwinghan/Common/Sembaran in Sylvan, if the magic was the goal
- mechanically, what does the language "Sylvan" imply. this would obviously depend on the game, but I would typically assume either: (a) speak Sylvan, write and read Sylvan with Elvish script; (b) speak Sylvan, write/read Sylvan with orthography of native language. But generally taking the language proficiency "Sylvan" should not generally give special ability to write Sylvan scripts.


Mike's response: generally agreed to There are probably 2 things:
1) Fey writing, as a thing, is just somewhat magical, whatever language they are writing in, if they want it to be. So a fey can of course write a perfectly normal letter in Tyrwinghan. But they also can "embellish" it in some way, which would with some powerful/rare exceptions be obvious, which would give it an emotional power/magical spin
2) The writing system for Sylvan, that the fey created in the age of myth, is so intertwined with the idea of magical fey writing that it can't be understood without the embellishments

 So it goes something like.... The fey develop this magical form of written communication, where there are embedded emotions in the words, and their written language never disambiguates between certain concepts without the embedded emotion Over time, you get: a) a non-magical and simplified version of the fey writing (Elvish) which just represents phonemes/syllables like normal writing systems b) fey learning to use their writing tricks on other languages


One idea from Kiya.... True fey writing in Sylvan might be non-linear, i.e. the central concept of a poem might be inscribed large and in the middle, and additional words and context in concentric circles around it

Which might then in turn lead to Tyrwinghan art sometimes replicating the appearance of fey writing, without the magic
