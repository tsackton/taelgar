In general many species will speak some sort of language unique to that species. This tracks exotic languages that canonically exist, or ideas for languages that probably exist, as well as whatever details have been made up for them. It is currently written more as background than website-focused but could be cleaned up.

Background notes on exotic languages that likely or definitely exist.

* **High Draconic***: The ancient language of the great wyrms of old. Very rare to learn, but said to be powerfully magical. No specific alphabet or real world analog defined.
* **Low Draconic**: Related in some fashion to High Draconic but spoken by kobolds and lesser dragons. The nuances and magical power of High Draconic is usually lost on those who only know Low Draconic, although they are usually mutually comprehensible for basic communication. 
* **Deep Speech:** This language is more a rumor than a known fact, but is suspected to be the tongue of the alien aberrations of the underdark, notably the mind flayers, their slaves and the twisted creations. Difficult to learn.
* **Gnoll**: a hideous combination of Abyssal and a magical beast tongue of hyenas; can attempt to understand if you speak Abyssal
* **Bullywug**: spoken by bullywugs mostly
* **Grell**: a corrupted form of Deep Speech, spoken by the greel
