%% there is a lot of discord discussion about language families. most has, i believe, been incorporated below, so maybe status/cleanup/external is unnecessary. might be worth keeping a note at the top to indicate there are reasons for some decisions below in external notes, if we don't want to try to copy the whole discussion. %%

In general many species will speak some sort of language unique to that species. This tracks exotic languages that canonically exist, or ideas for languages that probably exist, as well as whatever details have been made up for them. It is currently written more as background than website-focused but could be cleaned up.

Background notes on exotic languages that likely or definitely exist.

* **High Draconic***: The ancient language of the great wyrms of old. Very rare to learn, but said to be powerfully magical. No specific alphabet or real world analog defined.
* **Low Draconic**: Related in some fashion to High Draconic but spoken by kobolds and lesser dragons. The nuances and magical power of High Draconic is usually lost on those who only know Low Draconic, although they are usually mutually comprehensible for basic communication. 
* **Deep Speech:** This language is more a rumor than a known fact, but is suspected to be the tongue of the alien aberrations of the underdark, notably the mind flayers, their slaves and the twisted creations. Difficult to learn.
* **Gnoll**: a hideous combination of Abyssal and a magical beast tongue of hyenas; can attempt to understand if you speak Abyssal
* **Bullywug**: spoken by bullywugs mostly
* **Grell**: a corrupted form of Deep Speech, spoken by the greel

%% A few further notes based on Discord conversations:

First, any unique race (i.e. from the "unique race" category in [[Creating New Species]]) would certainly have their own language (as well as the elder races and humans), and in fact, the "main page" list of exotic languages certainly includes those. 

Second, the extra-planar languages would likely cover both (a) the element aspect of the Children of the Divine and (b) any fiend/celestial/native-to-another plane creature (i.e. the "Children of Belief" in [[Creating New Species]])

Third, the dragons, elementals, fey, and titans would certainly have had their own languages: draconic is discussed below; sylvan is well developed; titan is unclear but related to giant; elemental is extra-planar and discussed there:
* Dragons need thought and consideration and which must have some strange magic associated with them and need some thought on why they exist - perhaps related to the language of spellbooks
* Titans invented some kind of runic writing, but their language is not clearly considered and many or many not be related to Giant

Four, the alien mind creatures, i.e. the "alien" category in [[Creating New Species]], would speak their own exotic languages as well, such as Deep Speech, above. This might not just be deep speech and grell, but also e.g. the pictographs of the sentient ocean and the language of the merfolk.

Fifth, the orcs and goblinoids have their own languages. Other creations of the Void mind probably speak one of those language families, although could end up here as well.

Going through the remaining categories of creature, we have only the soulless creations and the magical. The vast majority of these creatures likely speak other languages, rather than their own species-specific language, although of course there could be exceptions.

This can be restated as effectively saying that there are broadly five categories of languages to be considered Exotic - 
* Alien tongues, mostly spoken by creatures in the "alien" category
* Beast speech, a potentially wide variety of tongues spoken by creatures (mostly) in the "awakened" category
* Planar tongues, or those related to planar tongues, spoken by the elementals and the children of belief
* The tongues of the children of the divine
* The tongues of the unique species
