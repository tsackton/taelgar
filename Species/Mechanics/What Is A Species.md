The multiverse of Taelgar contains a diverse array of self-aware creatures. This documents some metaphysics and worldbuilding about different types of creatures are different.

### Soulstuff
The foundation of sentience on Taelgar is soulstuff, an ineffable part of the multiverse. There is no clear definition or decision on what soulstuff is, but there are some fundamental principles about it that drive worldbuilding:

* Soulstuff accretes to self-aware and perceiving creatures, meaning that (with some narrow exceptions) all creatures with motives and awareness have soulstuff
* Soulstuff has implications for how a creature behaves: a creature with "elven" soulstuff shares some traits with other elves, although this should not be treated as absolute.
* Soulstuff is powerful: beings with strong soulstuff (such as PCs) can create supernatural effects from their own internal essence

### Magic
Magic is a fundamental part of Taelgar as well, and is ultimately sourced from the [[Plane of Magic]].  What magic is is not defined, but it has some principles as well:

* Magic and soulstuff are not the same thing
* Magic is impersonal - there is no "fire magic" or "elven magic" in the way that soulstuff can be associated with the Plane of Fire or the elven divinities
* The locus of magic is the Plane of Magic, although the mechanism by which it permeates other planes is not clear

%% Unclear: is Magic and Soulstuff in opposition? Do divinities use magic, or does soulstuff replace magic? %%

## Creatures

With this background, self-aware creatures can broadly be divided into seven categories:

* True species: these are creatures with a unique culture and language, and continuity across the world. There might be many different human, dragon, or kenku cultures, but they share an evolution, common history, and overarching narrative. Everything in this category should have the potential for a story for how it came to be. 
- Creatures of the inner planes: creatures of matter and magic in some proportion that are sentient and accrete soulstuff over their lifetime because of this sentience, which rapidly disperses when they die.
- Creatures of the outer planes: creatures of pure soulstuff, manifesting a body via the magic of their soulstuff. These creatures cannot be killed except on their native planes 
- Creatures of the Far Realms: visitors from the Far Realms, who lack Taelgaran soulstuff. These creatures have diverse metaphysical reality but have no soul to restore after death. Note that some Far Realms creatures may be true species.
- Constructs: creatures that are not really thinking creatures at all, but are animated by some magic which mimics sentience. They do not have souls at all and are rendered inanimate when killed, unless some magic restores them.
- Transformations: creatures corrupted or transformed during or after death into a new form. 
- Divinities: creature that have accreted enough soulstuff (via their own powerful essence or gift from elsewhere) that they have transcended the usual mortality 

### True Species

These are the unique species of Taelgar, the creaures with a common culture, history, language and creation story. A true species is distinguished by:

* A single creation story (or the potential for one) - these never just sprung up from the essence of a plane
* A common relationship to soulstuff. True species could have no souls (hobgoblins), gifted souls (humans), or souls tied to a plane (fae), but each individual member of a true species shares a source of soulstuff and the details of the soulstuff of a true species should be invented.
* A life after death (usually). In most cases, the soulstuff of a true species should have some vehicle for lingering after death, although this is not always true
* Existence in the Inner Realms. All true species are native to the Inner Realms. 

Each true species should have a detailed Species page, and most - but not all - are playable by PCs. In general, new true species should be discussed and new inventions here should be quite rare. 

%% There is a further typology here that could be created to distinguish humans  from elder folk from fey from giants etc %%

The following are canonically true species:
* [[Humans]]
* [[Dwarves]]
* [[Elves]]
* [[Stoneborn]]
* [[Halflings]]
* [[Lizardfolk]]
* [[Orcs]]
* [[Hobgoblins]]
* [[Giants]]
* [[Dragons]]
* [[Kenku]]
* [[Merfolk]]
* [[Goblins]]
* [[Kobolds]]
* [[Fey]]
* [[Centaurs]]

The following are probably true species:

* [[Gnomes]] (although they have not been used in play, and might really just be dwarves)
* [[Ithilids]]
* [[Dragonets]] (although relationship to dragons is unclear)

The following may or may not be true species:
* [[Bullywugs]] 
* [[Gidari]]

There are likely one or more true species amongst the elemental planes (i.e. [[Djinn]], [[Marid]], [[Efreeti]], [[Azer]])
### Creatures of the Inner Planes

These are the large category of creatures - often monsters - who exist to provide interesting adventures and stories, but who do not represent a meaningful
