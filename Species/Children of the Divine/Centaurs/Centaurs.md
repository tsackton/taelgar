>[!quote] Centaur creation myth
*Long ago, before the form of the world was fixed, we walked the ever-changing land, mindless and soulless, empty but for the whims of the Archfey. Yestare, the Beginning, and Mettare, the Ending, stepped into this chaos, and spoke words of separation, words of renewal, words of power to fix the form of the world and bring meaning to the chaos. In this timeless moment of sundering, when the lands of the Archfey were pulled away from the world, the World reached out, and chose us to be its guardians.*
>
*Taelgar itself gave us life, a purpose, freedom and souls, an act of need to ensure the land was not forgotten, an act not of the gods, even Yestare and Mettare, but of a higher purpose.In that moment, we awoke to our new selves. Our hoofbeats were the first to stride across the new world, fixed in form. Our souls were the first to be made, not by any god or power but by the need of the land itself.*

Striding across the open plains of the south, their hoofbeats ringing, a herd of centaurs turns north, following the winds and weather. The gentle strum of a harp as voices raise in song, in praise of the earth, around a campfire. The cycle of migrations, following the seasons across Taeglar. These are the rhythms of the centaur life. 
## The Horse Lords
With the torso, arms, and head of a human, and the four legs and body of a horse, centaurs are a blend of strength and grace. Typically standing 6 or 7 feet tall, with their equine bodies reaching 4 feet at the withers, centaurs are an imposing presence. They can run quickly, for miles, carrying a heavy load, and without tiring. While all centaurs share the same form, their appearance is otherwise as varied as the natural world they love.
## A Fey Heritage
Centaurs trace their origin to the archfey, and retain a fey heritage. Despite their deep connection to the fey, most centaur consider themselves to have broken free of the constraints of their fey ancestors, and consider the world of Taelgar to be their true creator, not the Archfey who shaped their form. 
## A Migratory People
Centaur societies are usually migratory, traveling on long migration routes that can take years to complete, sometimes even generations. Some centaur societies shape their travels to seek new marvels of the natural world, while others follow the time-honored paths of generations. While they will sometimes spend a season or a year in one place, building temporary camps and tending the local land, few centaurs build cities or other permanent structures. 
## Guardians of Taelgar
Centaurs usually do not worship gods, giving thanks and prayers to the world itself instead. Many centaurs view themselves as the protectors and guardians of the natural world. Never numerous, they have little power to stop human cities or empires from spreading, and don’t try. Instead, they try to heal what they can when they see the world is damaged. 

Their veneration of Taelgar also manifests itself in other ways. Many centaurs feel uneasy when they are not in contact with the ground, so second stories, ships, and even buildings with stone floors may make them uncomfortable. Centaurs tend to have a very light touch on the land, generally building no buildings and plowing no fields. Centaurs gather food from the land, trusting the bounty of the world to sustain them on their long migrations, supplemented with trade.

Many centaurs exploit this connection with the world of Taelgar to read the signs and echos and portents in the world, and other species often seek out centaurs for their skill in prophecy and divination.

Google Docs / Old Notes

In the Age of Myth, during the time when the children of the Divine walked the world, the Archfey made many things, many diverse forms and creatures, some that blended together the natural world and their vision of themselves. The dryads and the satyrs are the most prominent of these creations still in the world today, but many more existed in the days of high magic during the Age of Myth, including the progenitors of the centaurs, who, while similar in form, were fully fey at the time.

During the Riving, though, something happened that was not planned by any god or Archfey. As the Feywild, the Shadowfell, and the other echo realms were being pulled apart from the material plane, the backlash of this great tearing created the magical resonances in the material plane that are the source of the magic of druids and rangers. Somehow, in a way that is yet unexplained by lore or divine knowledge, these resonances changed the centaurs, tying them to the material plane and making them what they are today.

Centaurs consider the world of Taelgar to be their creator, not the Archfey who shaped their form, and also have a bit of arrogance in that they consider themselves to be the true ‘eldest race’ on Taelgar. They worship no gods, giving thanks to the world instead, and when they die their souls fade, believing that an eternal afterlife isolated from their creator is no blessing at all. In their view, damnation is actually persisting forever in some distant other plane, forever cut off from Taelgar.

They, of course, do acknowledge the existence of gods -- the Incorporeal Gods, the Embodied Gods -- but in many ways see these as a stain on the perfection of the world itself, given the evil that was created when humans started throwing curses at each other, for example. 

They do have a form of worship, though: they venerate the world of Taelgar itself. Their major form of religious practice, such as it is, celebrates moments of change in the cycle of the seasons, although the exact details vary depending on time and place. Even the same tribe may change its religious rituals over the course of years, as they move into new lands. For example, in Dunmar centaurs would celebrate the coming of the rains, and the end of the monsoon season, whereas in northern Chardon, they would celebrate spring and fall. These celebrations are not elaborate, usually involving a sacrifice to the earth, and a feast, and little more. 

Their veneration of Taelgar also manifests itself in other ways. They feel uneasy when they are not in contact with the ground, so second stories, ships, and even buildings with stone floors make them uncomfortable. They have a very light touch on the land, so tend to build no buildings and plow no fields, relying on a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, plus trade with humans (chiefly for wine and other luxuries), to supply themselves. 

When they die, they return to their creator in body and soul. Wanting no afterlife in some distant plane away from Taelgar, they allow their souls to fade, and believe that they are returned to Taelgar itself. Their bodies are also returned to the earth. Most commonly they are buried, and allowed to decompose, although some are cremated and the ashes scattered. Many graves are not marked, especially those that die of natural causes, but sometimes they will mark the graves of those that fall in battle, especially those that fall in battle defending Taelgar from its enemies, as a memorial and a reminder. They also carve small icons, in wood or clay or stone, of the fallen, or something representing the memory of the fallen, and will carry these as a memorial, leaving them in places around the world that feel particularly sacred. Although rare, it is not unheard of for a traveler, wandering far off the beaten trail, to stumble upon a hidden cave or ancient grove, filled with small statues of centaurs. 

Centaurs are reclusive, tending to stay on the outskirts of the societies of other races, especially humans. Never numerous, while they see themselves as protectors of the world and especially the land itself, they have little power to stop human cities or empires from spreading, or dwarven mines, and don’t try. Instead, they try to heal what they can when they see the world is damaged  

They do not particularly have a problem with orcs or many other “evil” races, especially those who simply attack humans, raid, and fade away, although they will certainly defend people who are in imminent danger of being slaughtered. But they are unlikely to, for example, hunt down an orc horde passing across their land. 

This should read not as selfish, but as “our concerns are larger than an individual village”. 

They have historically had somewhat poor relationships with fey, seeing them as “failed parents” in a way. Certainly they have a deep historical connection to the fey, especially dryads and satyrs who were once their siblings in a sense. But now they see themselves as having broken free of the shackles of their creation and still have some lingering resentment about the shackles (although many do not attribute this to malice on the part of the archfey, rather weakness/lack of power to do more).

- Migratory, travel on long migration routes that can take years to complete, sometimes even generations. Often seeking new marvels of the natural world, in a semi-religious sense.
    
- Hunter-gatherers, living in small independent bands. Young adults often will leave to seek a new tribe; most lone centaurs “adventuring” will be these young adults who have left their home tribe and have not yet joined a new one.
    
- Centaurs live only slightly longer than humans, with few living past 100.
    
- Most bands have traders, generally a family or a handful of families, who take responsibility for knowing outsider languages and organizing trade; these smaller bands will often leave the main band for a time and return with goods

- Centaurs main trade is animal products -- fur, bone, meat; also will trade omens and prophecy, and art, such as carvings or statuary made of bone, wood, or clay; also weaving; leatherworking
    
- Some more isolated bands have little contact with humans or others, preferring to remain far from civilization

- Centaurs are deeply involving in reading the signs and echos and portents in the world, and can sense these because of their connection to Taelgar. This is less of a “Dreamworld-based” prophecy, as lizardfolk, and more of a directly reading the signs and symbols in the physical world.
    
- Really do see themselves as the true first race, and also proud of their belief they are the only race that does not have a creator god, that came to be independently. This makes them a bit arrogant, headstrong, and stubborn about their free will, and hard to shake from a course of action they think is best.
