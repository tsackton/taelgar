%% NOTES

Trying to summarize some notes. obviously undead have come up a LOT in the Dunmar game, with three major undead villains. 

A *major* distinction with important metaphysical implications is between the three main types of undead:
-  lesser corporeal undead (e.g., skeletons, zombies and the like) which are basically animated objects and in some ways not that different from the Ladder or any other "animate something" spell. to the extent they have intelligence, it has nothing to do with the dead person, it is created by the magic that animates them. they don't have souls. some of these -- most introduced so far -- are created with a mindless desire to destroy life, and that tends to define some types, like ghouls/ghasts. but this isn't required, metaphysically.
- incorporeal undead (e.g., specters, wraiths, ghosts, etc), these are by definition the trapped souls of things that died but are prevented from leaving to the land of the dead. often created by more powerful undead when they kill something. 
- sentient undead or powerful undead or whatever - don't have a good name. mummy lords, liches, vampires, Grash, this kind of thing. these are usually the result of someone who make a conscious choice to work to become undead and so never actually "died", just passed from life to undeath. vampires sometimes a bit different, but vibe is there. note these are essentially all corporeal undead. it is not obvious if it is possible to willingly become through some arcane transformation a ghost, and there aren't really traditional high-CR incorporeal undead. 

this, i think, roughly follows standard D&D lore and is also influenced by Flee, Mortals. 

in practice, i tend to think of incorporeal undead as being associated with curses, violent deaths, etc. the plague hauntings are mostly all incorporeal undead, for example. the lesser corporeal undead tend to serve a master, although this isn't universal. 

note that is isn't entirely clear the role of [[Ghesyn]] here. my tendency is to think that Ghesyn is mostly associated with things like ghasts and wights, the nastier of the lesser corporeal undead, but this is not canon. 

on the topic of necromancy, i think there is an important distinction between mindless corporeal undead (skeletons, zombies) which don't affect the soul at all, and things like ghosts, specters, wraiths which represent a trapped soul unable to reach the land of the dead. plenty of people would see the former as a violation and evil, and I would imagine that cremation and/or burial on sacred ground would be commonly seen as a way to prevent that. however, the soul and the gods don't necessarily care - this is just human superstition around death. the latter has nothing really to do with the treatment of the body, as least not metaphysically.
	1. This leaves open the possibility of cultures with different attitudes towards undead. unlike enchantment magic, which I think is kind of universally at least dubious if not outright evil (since it involves taking away free will / consent), animating corpses into zombies or skeletons could be seen as perfectly normal. maybe the undeveloped islands west of chardon have a necromantic tradition, for example. 
	2. However, forcibly binding the soul of a dead creature to remain on the material plane and serve you - i.e., creating specters / wraiths - is akin to the worst kinds of enchantment magic and should be universally coded as evil, I think. 

there are a lot of notes that impinge on undead - over 350 unlinked mentions. not worth backlinking them all but there are more vibe details scattered throughout.
