# Derro
Twisted dwarves, the results of [[Ithilids|mind flayer]] experiments to create slave races. Severed from any connection to their firstborn and manipulated by mind flayers into their current form.

A small group of them lived in the [[Dwarven Outpost (Raven's Hold)|dwarven outpost near Raven's Hold]], but have recently been killed by a dwarven mission there.
