# A Brief Overview of Character Creation Options

The world of Taelgar is an extensive homebrew world, the setting for several campaigns run by both myself and my brother. Currently, Taelgar uses the 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons rules, supplemented with homebrew. 

To create your character, you will need to do the following, in any order:
- Determine ability scores. We use point buy or standard array (player's choice). 
- Pick a species (see the Species section, below)
- Choose a class. Generally any published class or subclass from any sourcebook is fine, excluding partnered content (Critical Role and Magic: The Gathering books). We use D&D Beyond for character sheets; you should have an invitation to a campaign with content sharing. Ask if this isn't working for you. 
- Pick a background. We use the [Character Origins UA (pdf)](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/character-origins/CSWCVV0M4B6vX6E1/UA2022-CharacterOrigins.pdf) for backgrounds. The ability score increases in your background replace the ability score increases granted by your species. We modify these backgrounds to allow a choice of two tool proficiencies, two languages, or one of each. This currently requires homebrew on D&D Beyond; ask if you need something created for you.
- Pick languages (see the Languages section, below)

You can review the [[Player's Guide]], with lore notes, and the living document of [house rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l2cPIqR7gkvSppYeM6ZBl7Mbf-Sd6qhRyW4HNuwnxfU/edit) as well. 
## Species

Taelgar has extensive homebrewed species options, that exist in various stages of revision. Some have been playtested more extensively than others.

Playable species include the following, in order of unusualness:
- [[Humans]], the most common species across Taelgar, with a variety of diverse cultures and religions.
- [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Lizardfolk]], [[Stoneborn]], and [[Halflings]], known as the Elder Folk, the creations of the embodied gods, the Firstborn of their people. While [[Halflings]], [[Dwarves]], and [[Lizardfolk]] are relatively common travelers among human cities, and can frequently be encountered far from their homelands, [[Elves]] and [[Stoneborn]] are rare, and many commoners will have never met a member of these species before. 
- [[Centaurs]], fey who have abandoned the feywild and see themselves as the guardians of Taelgar, are not an unusual sight on their travels across human kingdoms, but rarely stay long in human cities. 
- The various [[Fey]], who are the subject of many wild tales, some true and others not, and while not native to the material plane, are sometimes encountered as visitors to and even residents of human settlements. 
- The flying [[Kenku]], mysterious and secretive, who rarely leave their northern homelands, but are sometimes seen in the human cities and settlements, especially along the Green Sea. 
- The trickster [[Kobolds]], descendants of dragons, who are known throughout the world, but rarely welcome in human settlements. 
- Most [[Orcs]] are mystically bound at birth by a ritual to dedicate their lives to violence in the service of Thark, the god of war without end, but rumors persist across the human world of free orcs who have escaped these bonds. 
- [[Goblins]], who were created by a malevolent force to serve their [[Hobgoblins|Hobgoblin]] and [[Bugbears|Bugbear]] masters; those who escape are as likely to be pitied as scorned. 
- Only vague rumors of the mythical [[Gnomes]] and [[Merfolk]] reach the human settlements in northwestern Taelgar. 

Species not listed here are not available to choose as playable race in Taelgar by default. If you would like to play something different from the options here, I am open to discuss whether there is a way for this species to fit into the world of Taelgar, without any promises. 
## Backgrounds

Your background consists of the following features:
- **Ability Scores.** When you determine your characterâ€™s ability scores, choose two of them, and increase one by 2 and the other one by 1. Alternatively, choose three ability scores, and increase each of them by 1. *These replace the Ability Score increases from your species.*
- **Skill Proficiencies.** Choose two Skills. Your character gains Proficiency in them.
- **Tool Proficiency.** Choose one tool. Your character gains Tool Proficiency with it.
- **Language.** Choose one language. Your character knows that language.
- **Feat.** Choose one 1st-level Feat. Your character gains that feat. 
- **Equipment.** Your character gains 50 GP to spend on starting equipment. The character keeps any unspent GP as spare coin.

You may optionally choose to forgo the **Language** feature, instead choosing a second **Tool Proficiency**, or vice versa.

Sample backgrounds for each species are included in the guides for that species. 
## Languages

Availability of magic and magical communication and travel, while rare, is frequent enough to encourage the spread of common trade tongues. In the part of Taelgar that is the focus of this guide, the primary trade tongue spoken is Common, the shared lingua franca of all areas that were at one time under the sphere of influence of the Drankorian empire, and some adjacent areas, including the Dunmari, and most parts of Varstok and Skagenland. Many non-human creatures also know Common, which allow communication among creatures of disparate backgrounds. At the DM's discretion, conversing in trade tongue may lack nuance, and slightly increase the difficulty of any ability check that relies on clear understanding of meaning. ***This is a work in progress and details may change as new areas of the world are explored in play. Characters will always have an opportunity to retcon their language choices if elements of this section are revised.***
#### Human Languages
* **Drankorian**: The original language of the Drankorian empire. While no longer commonly spoken, it is still used as a scholarly language in Chardon and parts of Sembara. Drankorian shares an alphabet and some similarities with Sembaran, Chardonian, and Cymean.
* **Sembaran**: A number of related languages and dialects spoken in Sembara, parts of Vorstok, and Cymea. Derived from Drankorian.
* **Chardonian**: A number of related dialects and languages spoken in Chardon and areas west of mountains. Derived from Drankorian.
* **Cymean**: A number of related dialects and languages spoken on the Cymean peninsula and along the coast of the Green Sea south of Cymea.
* **Dunmari**: A number of related languages derived from a southern tongue, unrelated to Drankorian, and spoken primarily in Dunmar. Adopted the Drankorian alphabet, however.
* **\<Unnamed Eastern Language>:** The language of the original people to settle the Green Sea. While now largely extinct, this alphabet lives on in the languages derived from it.
* **Skaegish**: A group of ancient languages spoken by the Skaer. Uses the same writing as old languages in Tywingha and highland areas of Sembara, although those old languages are largely extinct. Uses the Eastern alphabet.
* **Highlander**: A number of related languages spoken by some of the highlanders and in the far north of Vostok. Related to Skaegish, but has diverged significantly. Uses the Eastern alphabet.
* **Northlander**: A number of related ancient languages spoken by the original inhabitants of the lands west of the mountains, still spoken by a number of Northerlander communities.
#### Non-Human Languages
* **Elder tongues**: The Elder Folk, created by the Embodied Gods, were endowed with language and writing by their creators. While some of these languages are commonly learned by non-native speakers, others are mysterious.
    * **Dwarvish:** The language of the dwarves, uses a runic script, often learned by outsiders and traders who want to engage in commerce with the dwarven kingdoms.
    * **Elvish:** The language of the elves, and often associated with magic. Frequently learned by scholars of magic or history. 
    * **Lizarding:** The language of the lizardfolk. Often learned by those who spend time living in lizardfolk communities.
    * **Halfing:** The secretive and rarely taught language of the halflings, made even more difficult for outsiders to learn given the expectation that speakers of this language will use telepathic cues for emphasis. 
    * **Stoneborn:** The language of the Stoneborn. Often learned by those who spend time in Stoneborn communities.
* **Goblin:** The language invented by the hobgoblins, and spoken by goblinoids of all types, as well as many of the servants and slaves of hobgoblins. Uses its own invented alphabet. While not commonly heard in the cities of Taelgar, it is not difficult to learn.
* **Orcish:** The language gifted to the orcs by Thark, the God of War. While few outsiders speak this language or understand its unique alphabet, those who would engage with orcs in combat or negotiation (to the extent such a thing is possible) do sometimes find a way to learn this tongue.
* **Giant:** The language created by the elder titans of old, and now spoken by the giants and their descendants. Often learned by scholars, or traders who would venture to giant settlements. Commonly learned by dwarves, especially those of the central mountains.
* **Deep Speech:** This language is more a rumor than a known fact, but is suspected to be the tongue of the alien abberations of the underdark, notably the mind flayers, their slaves and the twisted creations. Difficult to learn.
* **Draconic:** The language of dragons. Few learn the pure, **High Draconic** tongue of the ancient wyrms of old. More commonly heard in Taelgar is **Low Draconic**, the native tongue of kobolds and lesser dragons. However, these tongues are mutually intelligeble, and *PCs should simply take Draconic as a language and not worry about the distinction between low and high dialetcs.*
* **Centaur:** The language of centaurs. Uses the Elvish alphabet. Something that many might learn, although most centaurs speak Elvish, Sylvan, or both in addition to their own tongue, and most outsiders who must speak with them do so in one of those tongues. 
* **Rare tongues:** Many other creatures in the world of Taelgar speak a language of their own, including many of the unusual or rarer races in the world. These might include the strange language of clicks and hisses the **Giant Eagles** speak, or the strange demonic-influenced barking tongue of **Gnolls.** Most of these are difficult, if not impossible, to learn to speak without magic (and few have a written alphabet).
* **Extraplanar languages:** Time and space do not work on the other planes as they do on the material plane, and each plane tends to be represented by a single language. These are typically difficult, although not impossible, for outsiders to learn.
    * **Sylvan:** The language of the Feywild, of satyrs and fairies and others. The most common extraplanar language to be learned by natives of the material plane.
    * **Shadowkar:** The language of the Shadowfell.
    * **Primordial:** The four related languages of the elemental planes (**Aquan**, **Auran**, **Terran**, **Ignan** for the planes of water, air, earth, and fire respectively).
    * **Abyssal:**  The language of the chaotic demons of the Abyss
    * **Infernal:** The language of devils and others native to the Nine Hells
    * **Celestial:** The language of the divine and all the creatures native to the Divine Realms.
