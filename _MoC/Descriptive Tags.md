In addition to [[Status Tags|status tags]] (used to categorize the "work state" of a page), there are a number of common descriptive tags, used to category the type of information the page contains. Every page should have a descriptive tag outside of the \_MoC, Campaigns, Worldbuilding/Brainstorming, and Worldbuilding/High School Notes folders. Campaign information can have descriptive tags, but may not as well.

In general for these organizational units a subtype can be specified (i.e. person/ruler) but there is not a lot of value and given they are not consistently used, in general it would not be recommended.

* **person**: a specific individual
* **place**: a specific geographical place
* **organization**: a specific group of people or other type of organization, including things like pantheons or families or clans.
* **item**: a specific item, or a type of item, or a material. 
* **deity**: a specific page about a god or other deity
* **species**: a page about a specific type of creature. Can be used for broad types (humans) as well as more specific types (sea hags)
* **background**: a conceptual page that describes world background. This is still canonical information (or at least, potentially canonical, depending on the status page) but it doesn't refer to an individually identifiable in-game thing (i.e. Land Owning in Sembara or Climate Background). A good catch-all for otherwise unclear pages.
* **event**: a page about a specific event
* **session-note**: a page about a specific session
* **timeline**: a page that is entirely or mostly about the chronology of events
* **holiday**: a page about a specific holiday. Potentially should also have a religion/xxx tag
* **meta**: a page about pages, for example this page. Does not contain world information, but may contain information about world information. Can also be used for map of content-style pages that are outside the \_MoC folder, for example indexes of NPCs or indexes of events.
* **source**: a page containing the actual text or a paraphrase of actual in-world information, typically intended to be given to players as is. 

There are four other tags that can be added to clarify the page but one of these items on its own is not sufficient to remove the page from the missing tags list:
* **pc**: a page describing a player character. Use a subtype for the campaign, i.e. pc/greatwar or pc/cleenseau
* **religion**: a page something about a specific religion. Use a subtype to define the type of religion. Also should be used for organization and deity pages that are part of this religion, i.e. religion/mosnumena should get all of the pages about the Mos Numena religion.
* **historical**: the page references a historical place or person
* **testcase**: this page makes use of complex Javascript features and is a good page for testing changes with

Pages that do not have any of these tags are listed here [[Missing Tags]].
