The following status tags have a shared meaning:

- **status/needswork**: this note does not contain all of the information about this topic and shouldn't be treated as "complete." optional secondary tags include:
	- **notes**: additional details exist and are recorded in non-Obsidian notes or in someone's head, but haven't yet been captured in Obsidian
	- **wip**: additional details need to invented
	- **internal**: additional details exist in Obsidian, e.g. in the form of dates on other notes, comments in the note itself, etc, but haven't been fully incorporated into the note text
- **status/draft**: this note is largely complete but could use a second opinion / review before being considered canonical. Might need agreement before removing draft status.
- **status/check**: this note has a comment about consistency accuracy and needs someone to do a check
- **status/refactor**: this note has something about it that is not well captured by current Obsidian note organization, and might benefit from refactoring note structure (examples could be narrative history notes that should be refactored into timelines; or item notes that mix general and specific lore)
- **status/rethink**: note is relatively complete but there are details that might need to be rethought; best to include a comment here
- **status/stub** for "I just created this page because I was filling in back links or empty spots on the map but I don't know anything about it and its up for grabs"
- **status/unknown** for the status of the note is unclear

Generally speaking notes in Worldbuilding should never have a status tag.
