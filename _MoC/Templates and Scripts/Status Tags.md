The following status tags have a shared meaning:

- **status/needswork**: this note does not contain all of the information about this topic and shouldn't be treated as "complete." optional secondary tags include:
	- **notes**: additional details exist and are recorded in non-Obsidian notes or in someone's head, but haven't yet been captured in Obsidian
	- **wip**: additional details need to invented
	- **internal**: additional details exist in Obsidian, e.g. in the form of dates on other notes, comments in the note itself, etc, but haven't been fully incorporated into the note text
	- **secret**: additional details are secret (a complete note with secrets will just have them in a %%Secret%% block or %%%% )
	- **collate**: details need to be checked with other pages. Used somewhat interchangably with internal. 
	- **placestub**: 
- **status/draft**: this note is largely complete but could use a second opinion / review before being considered canonical. Might need agreement before removing draft status.
- **status/factcheck**: this note has a comment about consistency accuracy and needs someone to do a check
- **status/namecheck**: this note introduces a new "world level" name and should be confirmed
- **status/refactor**: this note has something about it that is not well captured by current Obsidian note organization, and might benefit from refactoring note structure (examples could be narrative history notes that should be refactored into timelines; or item notes that mix general and specific lore)
- **status/draft**: note is relatively complete but there are details that might need to be rethought; best to include a comment here
- **status/stub** basically empty pages where nothing is known. Once basic header information is filled in can be removed. When creating an empty page set status/needswork instead of status/stub if the page needs more than full header
- **status/unknown** for the status of the note is unclear
- **status/images** for pages that might benefit from additional of some images or descriptive text

Old: **status/uptodate**, **status/docreview**, and **status/notes** have no consistent meaning and should not be trusted. Any page with **status/unknown** and other **status** tags should not be trusted either.
