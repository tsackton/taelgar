# Templates
**WARNING: outdated and incomplete**

The metadata utils class  (util via customJS) provides a number of helper functions that make creation of dataview tables simpler. 

Currently these are exposed via a set of templates:
* members-of-org generates a table that shows the current members of the page
* members-of-org-historical generates a table that shows the current and historical members of the page
