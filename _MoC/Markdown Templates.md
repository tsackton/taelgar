prompt:
```
please examine the directory "People/Addermanians". for each note, choose one of the four templates in _templates/markdown/people-* and reformat the note to fit the chosen template.

use detail from the note itself as well as linked pages, backlinks, and other mentions of the person in session notes, _dm_notes, DM, or other places in the repository to fill in details.

extremely important (his is the most important instruction you have. be extremeley careful to make sure you do exactly this even if other prompt instructions conflict): if there is text in the note itself, you can reformat it, but NEVER DELETE DETAILS and NEVER CHANGE THE MEANING OF TEXT if it is already written in the note itself. if this information conflicts with other information in the vault, summarize the conflict in the %% comments section.

do not invent details that are not present in notes.

do not include optional headers, metadata, or DM notes unless there is relevant information to include.

all non-DM content should be written from an in-world perspective, using a Wikipedia-style tone. do not refer to "the advventures" or "the party" - this is a meta-game concept. you can use a party name or character names if necessary, but most notes should be written to be agnostic to specific campaigns. events should not refer directly to session notes. if you link to session notes, use a linking alias (e.g. [[link target|display text]]).

do not edit a note if it is already matches the appropriate template.

add tag "status/check/ai" to all notes that are edited.

if there are relevant campaign interactions, make sure to include them, with links, in the %% comments section. only use the campaignInfo line particularly important interactions (always include first met; include last seen if relevant and obvious; include significant other interactions where they are important)
