## Status Tags

Updated: 01/23/2025.

Status tags are intended to track the extent to which a page is useably complete and correct. A page which doesn't have any status tags should be both useably complete and canonical, although this does not mean that all invented information about the page is captured (see [[DM Information]] for more on tracking missing information).

Status tags fall into three groups:
### Non-canon

The following status tags should be treated with particular caution, as they indicate there are potentially wrong or misleading information on the note. 

**status/needswork**: The note has problems, either because the information needs to be reviewed, decisions need to be made about what is canonical, or there are other errors or issues that would make the note untrustworthy. The subtags are variable in their usefulness: *old* indicates something is superseded by worldbuilding and needs to be updated; *wip* indicates an incomplete page that usually has unresolved open questions that make it difficult to trust; and *gameupdate* indicates a page that needs to be updated to capture in-game developments. Other subtags are used but may not have reliable standard meanings. 

**status/check**: The details on this note need to be checked. Various subtags indicate the nature of the check, either by a specific person, or to verify a name, or to correct minor or major errors. Usually will have comments explaining the need for the check, and should be obvious from comments or subtags what part of the note is unreliable. 

**status/active:** This note is a major component of an ongoing campaign, and should be assumed to have a perpetual "status/needswork/gameupdate" tag. Often used for PC pages and central game locations. 

### Incomplete

The following status tags indicate the page is incomplete in some way, but the text that exists should be considered correct. Note that status tags should primarily be used to indicate "incomplete in a way that hinders usability", not "there is more to say" (which would typically be some kind of cleanup tag).

**status/stub:** page does not have sufficient detail for the page author to consider it useable for others; try to tag with a dm_owner as well at least until finished. 

### Cleanup

**status/cleanup**: The note is correct and complete but that someone wants to reformat it to make it nicer or more usable (e.g., collate detail from linked pages into summaries, incorporate comments into narrative, etc). As long as a page has at least one sentence of public-facing Taelgarverse content, a status/cleanup tag is never needed, and it has no bearing on the accuracy or completeness of dm facing information. This is a good tag to use for pages that are central but badly organized, or for pages that currently serve to collect links but could have more content, for example. This is also the tag to use for notes that need metadata cleanup, could use a map or an image or more detail, etc. The subtags are not controlled vocab and meanings may shift.
