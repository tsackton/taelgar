## Status Tags

Updated: 01/15/2025.

Status tags are intended to track the extent to which a page is useably complete and correct. A page which doesn't have any status tags should be both useably complete and canonical, although this does not mean that all invented information about the page is captured (see [[DM Information]] for more on tracking missing information).

Status tags generally fall into three groups:
### Non-canon

The following status tags should be treated with particular caution, as they indicate there are potentially wrong or misleading information on the note. 

**status/needswork**: the note has problems, either because the information needs to be reviewed, decisions need to be made about what is canonical, or there are other errors or issues that would make the note untrustworthy. The subtags here are variable in their usefulness, with the exception of _shared_, which indicates this is (a) not canon, and (b) subject to ongoing discussion, so the needswork tag should not be removed without discussion.

**status/check**: the details on this note need to be checked. Various subtags indicate the nature of the check, either by a specific person, or to verify a name, or to correct minor or major errors. By definition cannot be trusted to be correct. Usually will have comments explaining the need for the check. 

### Incomplete

The following status tags indicate the page is incomplete in some way, but the text that exists should be considered correct. Note that status tags should primarily be used to indicate "incomplete in a way that hinders usability", not "there is more to say" (which is what DM information is for). 

**status/stub:** page does not have sufficient detail for the page author to consider it useable for others; try to tag with a dm_owner as well at least until finished. 

**status/update**: page is actively involved in a campaign and there is recent (or not so recent) session events that impact the text on the page (use metadata/header if only whereabouts need to be updated).

### Cleanup

**status/cleanup**: the note is correct and complete but that someone wants to reformat it to make it nicer or more usable (e.g., collate detail from linked pages into summaries, incorporate comments into narrative, etc). As long as a page has at least one sentence of public-facing Taelgarverse content, a status/cleanup tag is never needed, and it has no bearing on the accuracy or completeness of dm facing information. This is a good tag to use for pages that are central but badly organized, or for pages that currently serve to collect links but could have more content, for example. 

**status/metadata**: the note could use metadata cleanup, or non-text updates (images, maps). This should never impact usability, although for example don't trust whereabouts for notes with metadata/header tags. refactor as a subtag here usually indicates the note has something about it that is not well captured by current Obsidian note organization and header tags; examples might include undead with both pre-death and post-death details (requiring tracking whereabouts after death, for example) or NPCs a person or party is aware of but hasn't met (where it is not obvious how to handle campaign info).
