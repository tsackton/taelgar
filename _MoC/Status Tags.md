## Status Tags

Updated: 12/05/2025.

Status tags are intended to track the extent to which a page is useably complete and correct. A page which doesn't have any status tags should be both useably complete and canonical, although this does not mean that all invented information about the page is captured (see [[DM Information]] for more on tracking missing information).

Status tags fall into three groups:
### Non-canon

The following status tags should be treated with particular caution, as they indicate there are potentially wrong or misleading information on the note. These tags should only be applied to notes outside of `Worldbuilding` and `_dm_notes`, and removing these tags should be considered very high priority. Ideally, these tags never linger, although some of the status/check subtags are fairly minor. 

**status/needswork**: The note has problems, either because the information needs to be reviewed, decisions need to be made about what is canonical, or there are other errors or issues that would make the note untrustworthy. This tag should specifically be used for pages that need high priority revision because the information cannot be trusted. Subtags should generally be avoided. 

**status/check**: The details on this note need to be checked. Various subtags indicate the nature of the check, either by a specific person, or to verify a name, or to correct minor or major errors. Usually will have comments explaining the need for the check, and should be obvious from comments or subtags what part of the note is unreliable. 

**status/wip**: specifically used for notes that have a particular format/style (e.g. region landing pages, History of XXXX pages, Playing an X, main Species pages) and are in the process of being converted but not finished; also used for primary sources that are not completed. Always implies `status/needswork`.

### Incomplete

The following status tags indicate the page is incomplete in some way, but the text that exists should be considered correct. Many pages exist in some degree of incompleteness, so this is a judgement call, but generally this should be primarily used to indicate that important information needs to be captured, documented, invented, or otherwise added to the page. 

**status/stub:** page does not have sufficient detail for the page author to consider it useable for others; try to tag with a dm_owner as well at least until finished. 

**status/incomplete**: page has minimal information, but is missing important details in some way. It is pretty arbitrary which pages get tagged with status/incomplete. Should generally have a comment indicating what is incomplete. 

**status/gameupdate**: page was complete at some point, but game events have intervened. active is derived from the old status/active tag, and cleanup is derived from the old status/cleanup/gameupdate tag, but it is not obvious that these sub-groupings are useful. ***Note that we are generally pretty bad about tagging notes with gameupdate, so the LACK of a gameupdate tag doesn't necessarily imply a note complete.***

### Cleanup

**status/cleanup**: The note is correct and complete but that someone wants to reformat it to make it nicer or more usable (e.g., collate detail from linked pages into summaries, incorporate comments into narrative, etc). As long as a page has at least one sentence of public-facing Taelgarverse content, a status/cleanup tag is never needed, and it has no bearing on the accuracy or completeness of dm facing information. This is a good tag to use for pages that are central but badly organized, or for pages that currently serve to collect links but could have more content, for example. This is also the tag to use for notes that need metadata cleanup, could use a map or an image or more detail, etc. The subtags are not controlled vocab and meanings may shift.
