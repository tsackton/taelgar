Status tags largely track (a) the extent to which a note contains all invented information about its topic, and secondarily (b) whether the note is adequately polished (writing is clear and in a good format, all metadata is present, images and maps are made if needed). 

The following status tags are defined:

**status/check**: the details on this note need to be checked. Various subtags indicate the nature of the check, either by a specific person, or to verify a name, or to correct minor or major errors. By definition cannot be trusted to be correct. Usually will have comments explaining the need for the check. 

**status/cleanup**: the note is correct and complete but that someone wants to reformat it to make it nicer or more usable (e.g., collate detail from linked pages into summaries, incorporate comments into narrative, etc). As long as a page has at least one sentence of public-facing Taelgarverse content, a status/cleanup tag is never needed, and it has no bearing on the accuracy or completeness of dm facing information. 

**status/needswork**: the note does not contain all information about the thing that exists. Tread cautiously. Subtags usually indicate where the extra information not captured is stored:
- *external*: in someone's DM notes, emails, OneNote, or other non-shared resources
- *internal:* shared and within Obsidian, but needs significant collating and usually some rewriting to ensure consistency across notes. Some overlap with cleanup but needswork/internal tends to imply the note may have out-of-date or incorrect text that has been superseded by invention elsewhere. 
- *rethink:* the note is wrong or incomplete in ways that need discussion to fix
- *shared:* the topic is the subject of discussion in Discord or emails or other shared, non-Obsidian sources. Can usually be removed by searching for all relevant information and sticking it as a comment. In many cases status/check/(person) or status/cleanup would be appropriate to add after doing so while removing the needswork tag. 
- *wip:* someone has invented stuff about this that is not written down. Notes with this tag should ideally always have a dm_owner frontmatter as well. 

**status/metadata**: the note could use metadata cleanup, or non-text updates (images, maps). This should never impact usability, although for example don't trust whereabouts for notes with metadata/header tags. refactor as a subtag here usually indicates the note has something about it that is not well captured by current Obsidian note organization and header tags; examples might include undead with both pre-death and post-death details (requiring tracking whereabouts after death, for example) or NPCs a person or party is aware of but hasn't met (where it is not obvious how to handle campaign info). 

**status/stub:** page is not finished being created. try to tag with a dm_owner as well until created. 

**status/update**: page is actively involved in a campaign and there is recent (or not so recent) session events that impact the text on the page (use metadata/header if only whereabouts need to be updated).
