The Taelgar Obsidian vault is organized broadly speaking into top-level directories that capture specific pages. 

Some of these are fairly disorganized and inconsistent, but we are slowly cleaning up organization over time. This page tracks the meaning of existing directories, and the state of the slow-moving reorganization.

## Definitions

For the most part, the vast majority of pages in the Taelgarverse vault are one of the following:

(1) Glossary pages, which tend to be relatively short, front matter heavy, and similar in spirit to the type of thing you would write in a glossary or dramatis persona in a novel. Generally written in a vaguely in-world style, effectively as if the PCs were taking notes in-world. 
(2) In world pages, which are typically used for "big picture" stuff where we imagine some kind of in-world scholarly controversy or uncertainty. Usually written from the perspective of a summary of in-world scholarly discussion, including in-world sources. Usually best reserved for places where it enhances the game to maintain in-world uncertainty about metaphysical truth. Often should have a dm note (in a Campaign:none block) with additional details to assist in running the game.
(3) Character-facing encyclopedia pages, which are written from the perspective of an in game encyclopedia article: omniscient, in that it states the true facts about the world, not the theories or controversies, but character-facing, i.e. it is written in a way that would read basically sensibly to a character
(4) Player-facing encyclopedia pages, written from the perspective of an "out-game" encyclopedia article: omniscient and character-facing but includes player-facing language (i.e. real world analogs or roleplaying advice or whatever). These should usually be tagged `meta`.
(5) Meta pages, generally DM or Worldbuilding facing, written from an author's note / meta perspective. These should usually be tagged `meta`.

Two other factors:

(A) DM Notes: almost any page might have DM Notes, typically included as either a `%%` comment block (if short, generally no more than a few lines) or a `%%^Campaign:none%%` block (if longer). These are particularly useful for in-world pages, but can be relevant anywhere. 
(B) Mechanics: a wide variety of pages might include mechanics or other "game construct" details. Generally speaking, these should be restricted to DM Notes sections (e.g., not published) except within Campaign directories, or potentially on Player-facing encyclopedia pages (e.g., "Playing a Dwarf" type pages).

## Directories

Finished directories have a clear meaning and type of allowed content, and are well-organized. We should strive to keep them this way. 
Clean directories have a clear meaning and type of allowed content, but may not be perfectly organized. 
Messy directories have no clear meaning or consistent organization, and often open questions about what belongs. 

### Finished Directories

These directories have well defined content, and are organizationally correct, although all pages in them may not be up-to-date. 

**Background**: Generally should contain **meta** pages almost exclusively. Not intended to be published, but rather intended to be a place to store canonical information that informs worldbuliding but is not directly player-facing. 

**Cosmology**: This directory contains **in-world** pages about the planes and related concepts. Could be published as is, or selectively, or not at all, as desired. 

**Species**: This directory contains **in-world**, **character-facing**, **player-facing**, and **meta** pages about the species of Taelgar. Player-facing pages should be kept in the Species\Mechanics folder, as should any "rules-heavy" meta pages.

**Worldbuilding**: This directory contains world building information of various kinds, including brainstorming and undeveloped ideas. See [[Purpose of Worldbuilding]] for more. Note that subdirectories are controlled here as well. 

### Clean Directories

These are directories that are well-organized and have a clear, consistent meaning and organization. This does not guarantee the directory itself fully meets these guidelines. Note may have minor open questions. 

**Campaigns**
- *Proposed Content*: Generally should contain a variety of pages that are specifically relevant to a particular campaign. This is basically entirely session notes; various kinds of handouts, letters, stories and other "primary material" introduced in game; treasure and party equipment; and campaign-specific player encyclopedia pages (e.g., indexes of NPCs, timelines, etc). There is some ambiguity about when treasure belongs here, vs in Things, but this is generally left as an exercise for the DM.  
- *Open Questions*: Does the Mechanics subdirectory belong here? These are a mix of half-finished notes about species, and individual house rules. I would propose moving these to Species and Background (or Worldbuilding/Research and Mechanics), respectively (these are typically published by directly placing the nav, so home directory doesn't matter). If we ever end up diverging on the mechanics of species, can revisit. The Player's Guide needs updating, and probably belongs in Background anyway. Probably would be good to make a "Non-canonical" subdirectory here as well where various notes that might serve as useful brainstorming or simply record-keeping from non-canonical games can go. The [[Campaigns/Campaigns]] page has detailed information on everything ever run that touches on Taelgar for reorganization purposes if desired. 

**Gods and Religions**
- *Proposed Content*: All variety of pages associated with gods or religion, though should presumably primarily contain **in-world** or **character-facing** pages, with perhaps some **meta** pages as needed. 
- *To Do:* Currently a raw dump of the old Festivals and Holidays, Gods, and Religion directories. Needs to be reorganized sensibly.

### Messy Directories

These directories do not have a consistent organization and often have open questions around what should go in here. 

**Events**
**Gazetteer**
**Groups**
**History**
**People**
**Primary Sources**
**Things**


### Open Questions
* Where do larger pages about culture of species go, i.e. [[People of the Rainbow]], [[Dwarven Kingdoms]], or [[Story About Halfling Merchants]]
