The Taelgar Obsidian vault is organized broadly speaking into top-level directories that capture specific pages. 

Some of these are fairly disorganized and inconsistent, but we are slowly cleaning up organization over time. This page tracks the meaning of existing directories, and the state of the slow-moving reorganization.

## Definitions

For the most part, the vast majority of pages in the Taelgarverse vault are one of the following:

(1) Glossary-style pages, which tend to be relatively short, front matter heavy, and similar in spirit to the type of thing you would write in a glossary or dramatis persona in a novel. Generally written in a vaguely in-world style, effectively as if the PCs were taking notes in-world.

- Pages written from the perspective of a "in-game" encyclopedia article: omniscient, in that it states the true facts about the world, not the theories or controversies, but character-facing, i.e. it is written in a way that would read basically sensibly to a character
- Pages written from the perspective of an "out-game" encyclopedia article: omniscient and character-facing but includes player-facing language (i.e. real world analogs or roleplaying advice or whatever)
- Pages written from the perspective of a "author's note/meta" perspective
-  "dramatis persona" style pages, which tend to be
