To facilitate cross-campaign sharing of information in Taelgarverse, two pieces of DM frontmatter are used:

## **dm_notes**

Can be none, color, or important. This is intended to reflect the extent to which there are non-shared, non-public notes in DM folders or other places (someone's head, for example) that add additional information to a page. None implies there are no non-shared notes; color implies there are shared notes that might add color, but nothing that is fundamentally important to reusing the note; important implies that there are significant missing details that might make additional invention around this topic complicated in the absence of discussion. 

Note that dm_note in conjunction with status tags is intended to be sufficient to determine if there is canonical information about the subject of a page that is not completely recorded. For example, dm_notes: none and no status tags implies that anything invented about a page is recorded on the page (or in links from the page). 

The distinction is that status tags (e.g., status/needswork) imply that the information on the page may be incorrect or misleading to trust, where dm_notes imply the existence of additional information that does not contradict the recorded information. 

## **dm_owner**

Can be mike, tim, none, player, shared. This is intended to reflect the degree to which a particular person has plans for a thing, or has ideas that might constrain the direction of the thing, implying that they should be consulted regarding any planning involving the note.
