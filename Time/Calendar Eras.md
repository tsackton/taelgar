# Calendar Eras

There are many different calendar eras in use across the world of Taelgar.

The two most commonly used, both in these notes and by scholars and the learned across Taelgar, are:
- Drankorian Reckoning, which dates years from the founding of Drankor. The new year in Drankorian Reckoning begins on January 1st. 
- Dwarven Reckoning, which dates years since the beginning of time at the end of [[the Riving]]. The new year in Dwarven Reckoning begins on March 17th of the human calendar. 

However, other calendar eras may occasionally be used, including:
- Dunmari reckoning, which counts dynastic years, and counts the new year from the Festival of the New Dawn, on January 23rd.
- Sembaran reckoning, which counts regnal years, and counts each year from the monarch's coronation. 

Halflings remember their history via the tale of years; each year has its own song and its own name. Typically halfings count the beginning of a new year from the day following the winter solstice, when the days begin to lengthen again. 

Elves view the passing of time differently than other races. Time flows for them sometimes much more slowly, and sometimes much more quickly than the shorter-lived races. Given their longevity, they are also greatly attuned to the long cycles of history, and reckon time by the passing of generations, know as *ka*, caring less for the human divisions of time into years.
