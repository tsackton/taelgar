# Calendar Eras

There are many different calendar eras in use across the world of Taelgar.

The two most commonly used, both in these notes and by scholars and the learned across Taelgar, are:
- Drankorian Reckoning, which dates years from the founding of Drankor. 
- Dwarven Reckoning, which dates years since the beginning of time at the end of [[the Riving]]. 

However, other calendar eras may occasionally be used, including:
- Dunmari reckoning, which counts dynastic years
- Sembaran reckoning, which counts regnal years

Halflings remember their history via the tale of years; each year has its own song and its own name.

Elves view the passing of time differently than other races. Time flows for them sometimes much more slowly, and sometimes much more quickly than the shorter-lived races. Given their longevity, they are also greatly attuned to the long cycles of history, and reckon years by the sweep of ages.
