A festival of homecoming dedicated to the Traveler, celebrated in December. 

%% NOTES
 festival of homecoming dedicated to the Traveler. I’ll start with a flashback cleaning up some loose ends from the orc camp, and then we’ll try to do an extended roleplaying scene to get back into things before any plot happens.  
  
Think about how your character would react to a festival of homecoming —the festival is one of community and returning to home. Traditionally it’s seen as a time to end travels and journeys and be back home, and it’s celebrated with communal caroling, exchange of food gifts, and small-scale open houses. Think wassailing in medieval England.  Robin, Celyn, and Viepuck would all have celebrated this festival in some way “back at home” but traditions could be different in different places.

Notes in both my email and session notes about how this played out in game; plus some memories on how it actually worked
