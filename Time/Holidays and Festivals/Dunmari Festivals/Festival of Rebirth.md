The Festival of Rebirth is a major religious event in the Dunmari calendar, the most significant feast day of the goddess [[Jeevali]]. It is celebrated on the first full moon after the vernal equinox, marking the beginning of summer. It is the remembrance and thanks of Jeevali's resurrection during the [[The Founding of Dunmar]]. As one of the most important festivals in the [[Dunmari Festivals|Dunmari religious calendar]], it is typically always associated with large communal fairs and celebrations around temples, and the coming together of dispersed communities, especially in the more nomadic [[Eastern Dunmar]]. 

## The Miracle of Jeevali's Resurrection

The central tale of the Festival of Rebirth is the story of Jeevali's Resurrection, strongly associated with the [[The Founding of Dunmar]]. It is typically told as follows:

![[The Miracle of Jeevali's Ressurection]]

## Typical Celebration

The festival of rebirth is traditionally celebrated over the course of two days. On the evening before the Feast itself, 


In [[Karawa]], the fair and games and market that happen before the Festival of Rebirth are particularly notable as they draw a wide, diverse crowd from across the desert lands. 

The Festival of Rebirth is typicalled celebrated as follows. Beginning the evening before the feast day, the priests and priestesses carry a tall sculpture, shaped like a tree in Karawa but taking other forms across [[Dunmar]]. In Karawa, it is made of vines, and dried flowers, and bits of wood and seeds all pulled together into a trunk, with a design that spirals up to a crown of branches and leaves at the top. 

The sculpture is carried in a procession to a public place of gathering -- in the desert on the edge of town in Karawa, where the priests tell the story of [[Jeevali]]’s miracle. 

At the climax of the story, the shrine is set alight, marking the death of Jeevali and the end of the religious cycle of the year. Many people stay awake through the night, in prayer or reflection. 

The next morning, a great procession marks the festival, with costumes and flair and joyous dancing. People gather their contributions to the new shrine, and by some trick of the light or by the magic of the gods these all these individual offerings begin to fuse together. A great feast then follows. 

%%OLDNOTES

After this meeting, the festival begins. Suma, the priestess of Jeevali, and a number of litter bearers carry a tall sculpture shaped like a tree, and seemingly made of vines, and dried flowers, and bits of wood and seeds all pulled together into a trunk, with a design that spirals up to a crown of branches and leaves at the top. They carry the sculpture to the desert, where Suma tells the story of Jeevali’s miracle. 

The festival centers around the public, outdoor shrine to Jeevali, which is thought to protect sources of water, keeping them safe from drying up or being contaminated. In larger villages, elaborate shrines stand watch over public fountains. Permanent shrines are always living things, growing often in incongruous places.

The festival begins in the evening, when the old shrine to Jeevali is burned, asking her to return and bless the people. This is a solemn ceremony of prayer, followed by fasting, with some religious devotees and priests of Jeevali keeping vigil.

The festival begins in the evening, when the old shrine to Jeevali is burned, along with sacrifices and appeasements to Jeevali, asking her to return and bless the people. This is a solemn ceremony of prayer, followed by fasting, with some religious devotees and priests of Jeevali keeping vigil.

At the climax of the story, the tree-shrine is set alight. As the shrine catches on fire, as it bursts into flames, it doesn't just burn normally, but pieces of it drift off almost like fireworks floating in all directions, but mostly west. And as these embers drift to the west, a sign goes through the crowd as Suma says that Jeevali is with us, Jeevali is going west and we will follow her. The next morning, the procession that marks the festival is a solemn affair, with none of the usual costumes and flair and joyous dancing. People gather their contributions to the new shrine, and by some trick of the light or by the magic of the gods these all these individual offerings begin to fuse together. 

In the morning, the fast continues. A quiet procession through the city happens midday, with offerings to Jeevali given to the temple. The rich and powerful show their status with elaborate outfits and generous donations, although poor shepherds and herders typically also give what they can, as participation is seen as a way to guarantee Jeevali's blessing for the household.

After the procession, public prayer continues at the shrine, and many people go to gather small tokens (desert flowers, seeds, feathers, reptile skins from molts, anything associated with rejuvenation, new life, etc) to place at the growing shrine. This continues until dusk, when a crowd gathers, and prayers are said. A chant starts at this point, coursing through the gathered people, and as the chant continues, if Jeevali's blessing is with the people, the shrine starts to grow. All the gathered tokens begin to coalesce, vines and green shoots sprout from the ground, and water begins to seep through the growing shrine.

With this, a celebration starts -- in good years, when the shrine Jeevali is particularly impressive, these can last all night.

The week before the Festival of Rebirth typically is a time for large, organized entertainment. In many communities, games and contests of strength and dexterity are held; in others, plays are performed. Markets spring up and people trade and make money. In a good year, wine and money flows freely; in a bad year, suspicion and dread replace them.
