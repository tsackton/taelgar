# Festival of the New Dawn

Celebrated on January 23rd. This marks the beginning of the new year and a new cycle of the seasons. The first day of the new year, in the Dunmari reckoning. Strongly associated with Laka. Traditions include a pre-dawn vigil, often including magical rituals to invoke Laka's blessing for the past and the future, and a procession/mystery play/recitation of the history of the Dunmari people from creation until today.
