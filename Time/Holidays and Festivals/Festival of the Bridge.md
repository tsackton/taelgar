# Festival of the Bridge

A [[Mos Numena]] feast day, celebrated on November 3rd each winter in [[Cleenseau]] and the surrounding towns. It commerates an ancient miracle when a single patrol of guards, led by a blessed priest of the Warlord, [[Robert Sonneboar]], held the bridge for three days against a [[Orcs|orc]] horde without reenforcements.

Today it is commerated by eating "river bread", a type of fried dough made to look a bit like the great bridge. Various organizations and people in town make their own variants (sweet or savoury) and there is something of an atmosphere of a bake-off. The organization with the most popular river bread is crowned champion of the bridge and gains bragging rights for the next year.
