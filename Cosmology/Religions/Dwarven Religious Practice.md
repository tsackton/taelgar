# Dwarven Religious Practice

Dwarven religion centers around the obligations and responsibilities of dwarves to [[Bahrazel]], and the rights and privileges granted by the [[Bahrazel]] in return. To many outsiders, dwarven religion often appears strange, or even to be not really a religion at all. Unlike most religious humans, dwarves are usually not particularly prayer or ritual oriented, and few dwarves have any kind of personal relationship with any of the [[Bahrazel]]. Nonetheless, the relationship between dwarves and the [[Bahrazel]] is the foundation of dwarven society and power. As the dwarves might say, the [[Bahrazel]] are like the mountains: you depend on them, they are the foundation of your society and wealth, but you generally can't, and don't, expect any kind of personal relationship with them. 
## Obligations and Favors

The main idea and guiding principle of dwarven religion is based around set of obligations and debts in exchange for power and favors. 

The most fundamental of these obligations is the blessing of the naming rite, when a young dwarf becomes  part of the dwarven community and accepts the obligations owed the Bahrazel. In return, the young dwarf gains the connection that sustains dwarven racial magic. Dwarves who never complete the ritual are seen as variously traitors and deserters, or, more benignly, non-citizens or even non-dwarves. And abandoning your clan, thuhr, and obligations to the Bahrazel after the ritual is a much greater crime than simply never making the exchange in the first place. 

The obligations that flow from this exchange are centered around accepting one’s role in dwarven society, and one's obligations to one's fellow dwarves, that all dwarves must have enough before any dwarf has an excess. The supposed reputation for greed of dwarves is largely imposed outsiders who don't understand the culture. 

Beyond the basic obligations to dwarven society that flow from the divine grant of runic magic at the blessing of the naming rite, the other common obligation that dwarves bear arises from the granting of a miracle of divine intervention. Such miracles, though rare, are not unheard of. However, those who are granted such miracles incur a debt to the [[Bahrazel]], that must eventually be paid. Because of this, prayers often seen as dangerous, in a way. The Baharzel might grant your prayer, but if they do they have power over you. And they can yank you out of your life to serve their purposes. So prayer is what you do when you are truly desperate. 
## Dwarven Religious Practice

Even those who wield divine magic don't necessarily have a strong prayer-based relationship with the Baharzel. Instead, they have a relationship that is more of a knight/lord kind of relationship, almost feudal with a sense of reciprocal obligations.  

The Baharzel are literally the source of runic magic, which most dwarves can use to some degree. So they are ever-present, but impersonal in a way. Many dwarves see the Baharzel as the kind of glue that holds everything together, that in some sense enforce the debts of honor and obligation that hold dwarven society together. But you don’t really worship glue. 

Dwarven religious practice, such as it exists, is thus much more of celebration of dwarven history, of dwarven heroes. Unlike say [[Dunmar]], most dwarven holidays are not the feast days for gods but commemoration of heroes from the past, and especially memorials to those fallen. There are a number of celebrations and days of remembrance and the like around the [[Great War]], and even going back to the first wars of [[The Downfall]]. 

That said, ceremonies around birth, the transition to adulthood, and death are explicitly religious. In particular, the ceremony of name-taking is deeply personal, basically a solo quest to find [[Heart of the Mountain]], which is the plane of the Baharzel. And in death, the hope of any dwarf for their spirit to return with honor to that place and dwell with the firstborn. But I am not sure there is much of a religious rite here — dwarven culture feels to me very strongly in the works over faith camp, and if by the time you die you are doomed to either destruction of your soul entirely or some kind of purgatory, it is too late, no last minute prayer is going to help you. And if the firstborn can lead living dwarves to their domain, of course they can gather spirits. So again I think burial customs would largely be around a celebration and honoring of the person, without a lot of explicitly religious rituals.




Many dwarves are not particularly religious, in that there isn’t a lot of prayer or holy days. Certainly there are holidays venerating the Bahrazel, but in many parts of dwarven society these would have a bit of a “secular” gloss, kind of like nationalist/patriotic holidays – a bit of a “founding fathers” vibe. 

Also, the Bahrazel don’t really grant prayers in the usual sense, and that typically divine power is accompanied by divine obligation. Unlike many human religions where the gods / divine gain strength through prayer and thus use miracles to sustain faith, the Bahrazel are just the Bahrazel, they don’t get stronger or weaker based on the strength of dwarven belief. Indeed, the debt or obligation to the Bahrazel is almost a physical thing, a fragment of dwarven essence, that is passed into [[Heart of the Mountain]] to allow the Bahrazel to reach into the world, and that that trade is in fact necessary for them to operate. Hence the need to travel to [[Heart of the Mountain]] to obtain your name and thuhr and runic power - each dwarf must leave a bit of themselves behind in the divine realm, an obligation to the Bahrazel, and it is that left-behind bit that powers their runic magic. Metaphysically, the idea is that the embodied gods have more physicality than the incorporeal gods. 

Theologically, there is a lot of debate in dwarven society about the nature of the Bahrazel, are they independent gods, facets of one god, or something else. Many dwarves simply worship them as a collective, for example, giving little thought to the individualistic nature of the seven.
