### Tanshi

This is the tanshi tradition. The gods of specific places are now less connected to places, and can be called and brought forth by sacrifice and prayer. But somehow there is still a tradition of small gods, not that powerful individually, who bring messages to the larger divines. 

  

I don’t yet have a great reason for why these gods don’t accumulate power, since they are no longer tied to particular places. Of course it is possible that this is simply the consequence of the fact that they have so few worshippers, and they could become powerful. But also perhaps there were many of them once and many are still acknowledged, a different spirit for each little thing, which means that none individually accumulate a lot of belief and power. 

  

I think a connection to the primordial planes could be interesting here as well, not just to Arha and Malik. 

  

There is also the question of where these spirits actually reside. The Kestavo, based on the lore so far, seem to actually reside in Taelgar, not in a Spirit Realm, which leaves open the question of where the souls of the dead who follow this tradition go (primordial planes?). But this makes sense because of the tight connection to place; for the tanshi spirits, drawn by sacrifice, it seems less appropriate to have them so tied to Taelgar itself. But, of course, the primordial planes could work well. And would make sense for the primordial planes to have a close connection to these ‘small god’ traditions since the small god religions are in many ways the oldest in Taelgar, and certainly the most similar to the original human forms of religious practice.
