# Zariya

The *zariya* are the animal spirits worshipped by the [[Vargaldi]]. The word, Zariya, refers both to deities, the small gods of the northern forests that take messages and prayers to the [[High Gods]], and to souls, the animal spirits of the [[Vargaldi]] people, that manifest when they shape-shift or summon animal companions. 

As a religion, the folk worship of the [[Zariya]] bears many similarities to the other descendants of the early northern folk religions, the [[Tanshi]] and the [[Kestavo]], with the notable distinction that the small gods are strongly tied to animal forms.
