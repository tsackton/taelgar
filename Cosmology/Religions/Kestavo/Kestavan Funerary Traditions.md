## Kestavan Funerary Traditions

In the Kestavo tradition, the most important guide of the soul to its final home is neither human prayer nor the guidance of priestly ritual, but the *kestavo* themselves. These small gods are not keepers of heavenly kingdoms, but instead guides along the journey. The *kestavo* are expected to guide a soul from the [[Plane of Souls]], at birth, to the [[Material Plane]], and similarly from the [[Plane of Souls]] to the [[Land of the Dead]] at death, and then through the Land of the Dead to the ultimate resting place. As in many cultures, this journey through the Land of the Dead is fraught with peril, and the guidance of a *kestavo* is critical to ensure the soul is not lost along the way. 

In order to facilitate this, the kestavan tradition emphasizes burial of the body in a sacred spot, where the kestavo could easily find the soul, typically considered to linger near the body until ushered to the Land of the Dead. The kestavo would then guide the soul into, through, and out of the Land of the Dead to the final resting place. The ultimate destination of these souls is imagined differently in different regions - but a common idea is a reunion with the ultimate creator, [[Ako]]. The journey was usually thought to last for ten nights, and so communal traditions hold that prayers and remembrance during these ten days of the journey help the soul burn bright for the kestavo guide.

### Attitudes Towards Bodies
In the kestavo tradition, having the body - which is the locus of the soul at death - somewhere a kestavo can find it is critical. Those whose bodies are lost need help from the community to ensure a kestavo can find their soul, wherever it is, and recovering lost bodies for burial is important. Great efforts would be undertaken to recover bodies, and things like drowning would be seen as particularly horrible ways to die. The soul, lost in a strange place, has no guide. Similarly, a burned body or otherwise destroyed body risks the kestavo not being able to find the soul.

In cases where a body cannot be found, tokens of the person in life are thought to help connect the soul and the kestavo, but it is no substitute for a body. Better than tokens is bringing a kestavo to were the body is. So for example there are myths and stories of how a hero coaxed a kestavo to move into a lake after her husband drowned, as a way to ensure he had a guide to the afterlife.

Being killed and left unburied is therefore seen as a particularly evil way to kill someone, and the idea of killing everyone in a village and scattering the bodies far away from the protective kestavo is seen as the worst sort of war crime.

In the kestavan tradition, the body is a key locus of the soul, and thus it is rare for the body to be cremated or destroyed before
