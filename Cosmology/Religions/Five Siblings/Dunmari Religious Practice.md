# Worship

Dunmari worship practice is focused on two main distinct but equally important sets of rituals and traditions, one communal and one individual/familial, with a third strand of ritual practice associated with mystery cults. 

The Dunmari see themselves as in communion with the Five Siblings, who are part of the Dunmari community. Temple practice, public festivals, and monuments represent the outward facing, communal aspects of worship, celebrating and giving thanks for their community with the gods. Personal prayer and family practice, on the other hand, is focused on individual needs, giving thanks, asking forgiveness, offering prayers for guidance and aid, and how individual relationships with one or more gods are celebrated. Finally, mystery cults explore the esoteric, secret side of the gods. Some focus on understanding the will of the gods, the hidden divine knowledge of the higher purpose of the Dunmari people. Others focus on achieving greater communion with the gods, through esoteric practices that can only be taught by direct instruction from master to initiate. 
## Temple Practice

The focus of worship practices that take place at temples is the community. Ceremonies about joining and leaving the community -- coming of age rites and funerals in particular -- take place at temples, as do communal acts of thanksgiving and prayer. 

Because most Dunmari have traditionally not lived in villages, being instead dispersed across the landscape and only coming together occasionally, temples also are often some of the most significant permanent structures in the Dunmari landscape. Because of this, they are the focus of the community, and because of the intertwined nature of the state and the religion, temples also serve as the backbone of state administration. 
#### Temples and Monuments

Temples are often some of the most significant permanent structures across the Dunmari landscape, and the temple communities that grow up around them have traditionally been the focus of state administration. Many of the traditional roles of government -- taxation, taking a census, resolving disputes and administering the law -- are organized around temples.

Architecturally, there are several different temple styles in Dunmar. The traditional style, which describes most temples in Dunmar, is a pentagonal building, with an entryway at one corner and altars to the five siblings on the five walls. Jeevali’s altar is usually placed opposite the entryway. More elaborate designs add wings to two or more of the other corners, and elaborate on the entryway, extending it into a nave of sorts. These additions often house administrative or state functions. Many temples are also part of complexes that included living quarters for the priests and administrative space for state purposes, such as meeting chambers, private council chambers, and storerooms. 

All these designs, though, reserve the central space, surrounded by the gods, for the community, with the idea that the Dunmari are surrounded and protected by their gods. This is the space used for community rituals, but also for public trials and pronouncements of judgement, and other public functions of the state. The most common organization has pews facing Jeevali, but this is not the only arrangement, and some elaborate temples even have moveable pews. 

Shrines to individual gods, although rare, do also exist. Typically, these are not freestanding buildings or places of worship, but rather parts of other buildings. Most commonly, shrines to Aagir are often present in fortresses and other military buildings, but libraries or other places of learning may have shrines to Laka, hospitals shrines to Jeevali, and so on. Unlike temples, these usually don’t have altars and are not typically set up as areas of public worship. Instead, they have statuary, larger and more permanent versions of the icons that people carry as their personal tokens of the gods, and are generally semi-private spaces for personal prayer and reflection. 

Shrines to individual gods, as part of cult complexes and monasteries, are also a significant component of mystery cults. These buildings are invariably dedicated solely to the god of the mystery cult, although they often contain shrines or icons to the other gods as well, and are always part of a larger complex of buildings that serve the cult.

The third style of religious architecture common in Dunmari culture are monuments. These vary in style and purpose, but are united by a few features. Most importantly, these structures usually give thanks for a specific thing: the life of a great person, an important victory, or another notable event. These typically are not specifically miracles, but reflect important moments in Dunmari life, and the monument serves to thank the gods for their role in achieving success. 

The most common monuments are associated with the ruling Samraats, as elaborate monuments are often used as a way of signaling the power and favor of the Samraat and thus the people. Sometimes the Samraat is buried in their monument, and they become royal tombs; this is particularly the case for the Aatmaji dynasty, whose royal tombs outside Kharsan are notable, other times they are more like shrines, and often they are pure monuments with no secondary purpose or function. But these are not the only kind of monuments, and others have grown up around various significant events in the past.

### The Priesthood

The priesthood of the Five Divines is, in many ways, inseparable from the Dunmari state. The Samraat, as the acknowledged representative of the gods on Taelgar, is formally the head of the priesthood. Officially, the Samraat controls all priestly appointments, and has the power to both assign priests to temples and dismiss priests from their posts. They are in principle supposed to use this power in accordance with divine guidance, and judiciously. Historically, these judgements, especially for important temples, were usually made in conjunction with an informal council of priests of notable temples. And in practice, the current priest of a temple tends to choose a successor, and only rarely is that choice rejected, at least for most of the small community temples scattered across the land.

More recently, this tradition has changed somewhat, especially in the west, as the civil bureaucracy has grown larger, and the Samraat court has sought more direct control. Now, the head priests of major temples are often asked to retire when a new Samraat comes to rule. A growing class of emeritus priests now exist in the west, who lack a traditional role in Dunmari society. In the east, many now do not even present the choice of a new priest to the Samraat court for official approval, instead turning to the local leaders to ratify the choice. 

Like much of Dunmari society, there is no real hierarchy below the Samraat. Again, in principle, all priests are equal in the eyes of the gods, although of course those who run historically important temples or temples in large cities have a lot more political power than those in small, out of the way places. But there is no formal system of hierarchy in between the Samraat and the local priest.

Small temples are often run by just the priest, usually with one or more acolytes, and almost always with at least a few lay assistants, who are generally involved in the administrative side of the temple. Larger temples, especially those in big cities, are still run by a head priest, but may have associate priests to assist, and a much larger body of acolytes and lay assistants.  

Entry into the priesthood is universally through training and study with an existing priest, and it is typically assumed that a priest will be divine-touched, usually meaning they have access to some form of divine magic, although sometimes this could mean they are particularly skilled at reading the signs of divine will. Most priests have a personal connection with a specific god, but theologically this is not supposed to influence their role in leading the community in communion with the entire Divine Family. 

Reflecting the sense that priests are in some sense one of the divine family, they are referred to as Brother or Sister. 

The only formal, religious role of priests is to preside over festivals and public rites. In practice, most are also community leaders and civil administrators as well as religious figures. 
## Personal Prayer 

Despite the central role of temples in Dunmari society, most worship does not occur at them. Daily prayers, contemplation, and thanksgiving, as well as many personal and family rites, occur instead in personal or individual shrines.

Although these are called shrines, physically they are portable icons and statuary of the gods. Most people have one of each of the Five gods, although some will have multiple versions, and occasionally individual travelers will just carry one. Mostly these are small icons, often statutes, that are easily portable and can be carried anywhere and set up easily to form a sacred space. 

Daily prayers, family rituals, and even acknowledgement of festivals among travelers who cannot return to a village or temple happen before these icons. They are sometimes seen as part of the family, and some have been passed down for many generations, although occasionally they will be cremated with the deceased as a way to ensure the spirits of the dead reach the halls of the gods. 
## Rites and Rituals

Rites and rituals in Dunmari culture are separated into communal rites, which take place at temple, and private rites, which take place before the family shrine. 

The most important communal rite is the coming of age ceremony, which is a major marker of adulthood and reflects the choice of the original Dunmari to leave Hkar and seek their destiny. This ceremony is usually celebrated about once a year at each temple, with all those who reach the age of adulthood in the past year participating in a communal ceremony. 

Birth and marriage, in contrast, are seen as private rites. Naming and marriage ceremonies require no witnesses beyond the gods, and are usually celebrated as family affairs with just the family icons to give witness of the gods. 
### Funerals

Funerals have some aspects of both private and communal rites. The private goodbye, the farewell to the body, is a family ceremony that involves the cremation of the dead, happens soon after death and is a private rite; in part this is practice, due to the difficulty of being able to return to a temple immediately. But the real funeral, the farewell to the soul, takes place later, at a temple, and is usually a communal affair, where many souls are welcomed into the halls of the gods at once. 

In the Dunmari tradition, the first rite of death, the farewell to the body, must take place as soon after death as is practical. This rite is the private goodbye, the time of mourning and sorrow to say farewell to the dead as they embark on their journey to the Afterlife. Bodies are burned in funeral pyres, often with small tokens to help them on their journey, especially things that remind the soul of the good they did in life, or remind them of the gods. Sometimes the small icons of the Dunmari gods that most Dunmari carry are burned as well. If a person had a particular vice that might keep their spirit from leaving for the [[Land of the Dead]], this may also be burned, usually placed at the bodies’ feet, to remove the temptation to stay. Usually the ashes from cremation are scattered before 10 days have passed, but sometimes they are kept and interred in temple crypts during the second rite.

The second rite of death happens later, often much later, as part of a communal ceremony. There is no strict time limit, but it must happen at least 10 days after death, and usually happens within a year of death. This is a ritual carried out in a temple, where candles are lit for each soul being celebrated, and the colors of the flames are interpreted as indicating the final disposition of the soul. This communal funeral is usually followed by a celebratory feast honoring the dead. As part of the ceremony, small mementos of each dead soul are often created as a way for those close to the dead person to keep the memory of their soul near.

%%
In the Dunmari tradition, the first rite of death is what helps the soul get to the Land of the Dead, but once there, the Dunmari gods will guide them, and the Dunmari typically trust to the gods and don’t believe that human intervention is necessary to ensure a soul makes the journey.   

Unburied bodies, therefore, are a concern primarily because the soul may still be tied to the Material Plane, and have not actually made it to the Land of the Dead. Dunmari groups, such as the Order of the Awakened Soul, that have made it their mission to seek out the unburied dead do so primarily to ensure that no lost souls are stuck, wandering in Taelgar, unable to leave; this is especially so because it is believed that traumatic deaths are more likely to keep a soul stuck and unable to reach the Land of the Dead.

%% old notes


%% notes on possible other branches of the Dunmari people, not canon

The later history of the Dunmari, post fall of Drankor, features two schisms. 

- Some people did not follow Bhishma north, and remained on the edges of the desert; these are the SouthDunmari
    
- Others followed Bhishma, but turned east instead of west, and settled on the shores of the Green Sea, south of Cymea and around the mountains to the southeast; these are the EastDunmari
    
- The SouthDunmari and Dunmari are the significant majority of all Dunmari, with the EastDunmari a minority. 
    
- However, the SouthDunmari and the EastDunmari remained much closer to each other, and more connected, while the Dunmari diverged, so from a religious point of view there is basically the “Bhisma” branch and the “original” branch of the religion

This communal funeral is usually followed by a celebratory feast honoring the dead. As part of the ceremony, small mementos of each dead soul are often created as a way for those close to the dead person to keep the memory of their soul near (not sure about this).  

### Festivals

- Festivals play a major role in Dunmari culture. They are not just religious celebrations, but moments when the normally widely dispersed community comes together. There are usually markets, games, and other community events around the religious rituals. A few major festivals are celebrated by communal gatherings, including sometimes the return of wandering communities to fixed temples, but many others are celebrated in smaller groups or marked by private household rituals and prayers
    
- The cycle of Dunmari festivals and feast days runs from January to January, with the new year marked around January 15th. 
    

- The Festival of Rebirth (April, first full moon after the vernal equinox, the beginning of summer): celebrating Jeevali’s resurrection. This is one of the most important festivals of the the year, and is almost always associated with large communal fairs and celebrations around temples, and the coming together of dispersed communities. Strongly associated with Jeevali and Bhishma.
    
- The Feast of Bhishma (two day festival, first new moon in June, the end of summer): a celebration of Bhishma’s ascension to godhood, as well as the founding of Dunmar. The first day is a day of remembrance, the second is a pure celebration, a feast and party holiday, usually celebrated with family and kin, not necessarily involving travel back to villages or temples. However, it was a time when the Mystai of Bhishma gathered for their annual council and gathering. This is usually around the summer solstice.
    
- Day of Renewal (the day following the first arrival of the monsoon): a day marking Jeevali’s tears, the sacrifice and renewal of the land they represent. No fixed date, but this festival is acknowledged on the day following the first monsoon rains of the season. It is a day of reflection and personal prayer, and also a day of thanksgiving to the gods. Many people will save some special treat or drink for the evening meal on the Day of Renewal, but otherwise is often a very personal feast day. 
    
- Jaankar (Chidya’s Day) (July 21-22, when the month of the summer solstice is over): a celebration of life, of the next generation of animals, and also of wildness and spontaneity. Celebrated for two days, first by ceremony and thanks for the next generation and the life of horses, lambs, and the other animals on which the Dunmari depend, and then from sundown to sundown a wild party. 
    
- Aagirvala, or the Festival of Aagir’s Spear (first full moon after the autumnal equinox): a day to mark victory in battle, but also remember and acknowledge the viciousness of the war of conquest of the Dunmari, and remember those killed in anger. Can be a tense holiday, as it also has strongly nationalistic vibes. Celebrated with feats of strength and endurance, and tournaments, and skill at weaponsmithing.
    
- Needs a name - harvest festival / feast of slaughter (early November based on lunar calendar): celebrates the harvest, associated with special food and when animals are slaughtered before the dry seasons / winter, associated with feasting, not particularly with the gods
    
- Sonkar’s Day / Day of Atonement (Dec 21st, winter solstice): a day of prayer, atonement, and judgment before Sonkar, which starts the last month of the year which is seen as particularly holy and a time when many gather when food is plentiful after the bounty of the rainy season. 
    
- Sun Festival (Jan 22nd): end of the winter solstice, start of new year
    
- Laka Day: after sun festival, celebration of the northward journey of the sun, ??
    
- 1-2 more in Feb/March, between Laka Day and Festival of Rebirth
    

### Mystery Cults 

  

All the major gods, as well the minor gods Shakun and Arda, and several significant semi-divine dynastic rulers, including Bhishma and Kotana, have mystery cults associated with them. For the Five Siblings, the mystery cults are more like monastic orders in some ways: they tend to be adjacent to, but not supplant, the public worship of these gods in main temples. While all have headquarters, Mystai of these major gods are spread out and there are multiple monasteries dedicated to each major god.

  

The mystery cults of the minor gods and semi-divine historical figures are much more likely to be the only form of worship of these gods, and to be associated with one particular place with little or no affiliation among different Mystai.

  

So, while the Lakan Mystai have a major monastery near Tokra, a few smaller monasteries exist in other places across the country, functioning almost like branches of the Tokra monastery. In contrast, the Temple of Shakun in Karawa is the only place where Shakun is worshipped. 

  

All mystery cults are associated with magic and miracles, although the manifestation of this varies from cult to cult. 

  

## ROUGH NOTES

The Festival of Rebirth (old see session for final)

A major event in the Dunmari religious calendar is the festival of rebirth, celebrating the rebirth of Jeevali. This festival has its roots hundreds of generations ago, before the Dunmari came north; in their ancestral homes, it was associated with the start of the planting season. During the height of Dunmari power, it became associated with birthing season of animals. Now, with the weather changed and the land drier and more arid, the festival of rebirth is associated with the flowering of the desert in the late spring, when there has been enough rains in the winter, and the gathering of herders to trade before dispersing widely during the dry, hot summers.

The festival centers around outdoor shrines to Jeevali. All Dunmari have a shrine to Jeevali somewhere, even if it is just a small statue carved of wood next to the campfire of a lone traveler. These shrines protect sources of water, keeping them safe from drying up or being contaminated. In larger villages, elaborate shrines stand watch over public fountains. Permanent shrines are always living things, growing often in incongruous places.

The festival begins in the evening, when the old shrine to Jeevali is burned, along with sacrifices and appeasements to Jeevali, asking her to return and bless the people. This is a solemn ceremony of prayer, followed by fasting, with some religious devotees and priests of Jeevali keeping vigil.

In the morning, the fast continues. A quiet procession through the city happens midday, with offerings to Jeevali given to the temple. The rich and powerful show their status with elaborate outfits and generous donations, although poor shepherds and herders typically also give what they can, as participation is seen as a way to guarantee Jeevali's blessing for the household.

After the procession, public prayer continues at the shrine, and many people go to gather small tokens (desert flowers, seeds, feathers, reptile skins from molts, anything associated with rejuvenation, new life, etc) to place at the growing shrine. This continues until dusk, when a crowd gathers, and prayers are said. A chant starts at this point, coursing through the gathered people, and as the chant continues, if Jeevali's blessing is with the people, the shrine starts to grow. All the gathered tokens begin to coalesce, vines and green shoots sprout from the ground, and water begins to seep through the growing shrine. 

With this, a celebration starts -- in good years, when the shrine Jeevali is particularly impressive, these can last all night. 

The week following the Festival of Rebirth typically is a time for large, organized entertainment. In many communities, games and contests of strength and dexterity are held; in others, plays are performed. Markets spring up and people trade and make money. In a good year, wine and money flows freely; in a bad year, suspicion and dread replace them.

Now, with the weather changed and the land drier and more arid, the festival of rebirth is associated with the flowering of the desert in the late spring, when there has been enough rains in the winter, and the gathering of herders to trade before dispersing widely during the dry, hot summers.

The festival centers around outdoor shrines to Jeevali. All Dunmari have a shrine to Jeevali somewhere, even if it is just a small statue carved of wood next to the campfire of a lone traveler. These shrines protect sources of water, keeping them safe from drying up or being contaminated. In larger villages, elaborate shrines stand watch over public fountains. Permanent shrines are always living things, growing often in incongruous places.

The festival begins in the evening, when the old shrine to Jeevali is burned, along with sacrifices and appeasements to Jeevali, asking her to return and bless the people. This is a solemn ceremony of prayer, followed by fasting, with some religious devotees and priests of Jeevali keeping vigil.

In the morning, the fast continues. A quiet procession through the city happens midday, with offerings to Jeevali given to the temple. The rich and powerful show their status with elaborate outfits and generous donations, although poor shepherds and herders typically also give what they can, as participation is seen as a way to guarantee Jeevali's blessing for the household.

After the procession, public prayer continues at the shrine, and many people go to gather small tokens (desert flowers, seeds, feathers, reptile skins from molts, anything associated with rejuvenation, new life, etc) to place at the growing shrine. This continues until dusk, when a crowd gathers, and prayers are said. A chant starts at this point, coursing through the gathered people, and as the chant continues, if Jeevali's blessing is with the people, the shrine starts to grow. All the gathered tokens begin to coalesce, vines and green shoots sprout from the ground, and water begins to seep through the growing shrine. 

With this, a celebration starts -- in good years, when the shrine Jeevali is particularly impressive, these can last all night. 

The week or so prior to the Festival of Rebirth typically is a time for large, organized entertainment. In many communities, games and contests of strength and dexterity are held; in others, plays are performed. Markets spring up and people trade and make money.

  

Story of Jeevali:

The festival of rebirth is a celebration of a major miracle. The story goes that when the Dunmari first settled the land, it was dry and dead, a barren landscape cursed by the plague. The people suffered, and died, from drought and hunger and fear. Jeevali wept for her people, crying tears that poured from the heavens, cleansing the land and purifying the soil. But as she cried, she put so much of her power and spirit into her tears that she began to fade away. She diminished, and was gone. 

For a year, the people prayed, singing her name every day, calling to her, begging her to return. The first harvest, grain was sacrificed. The first lambs and calves and foals were sacrificed. As the winter rains fell gently on the land, the people prayed and chanted her name. In the spring, as new life began to grow from the fertile soil, Jeevali appeared as a XXXX symbol, the power of the belief of her people restoring her.

Since then, the Dunmari have celebrated the Festival of Rebirth, marking the founding of Dunmar, the grace of Jeevali in saving the people, and the miracle of her restoration.**
