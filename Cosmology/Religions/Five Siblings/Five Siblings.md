# The Five Siblings


The religion of the Dunmari is an old religion, adapted and evolved from the old ways when the Dunmari were a nomadic people living far to the south, before they settled among the ruins of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]. The Dunmari worship a family pantheon, the Five Silbings, along with other minor gods and goddesses. Dunmari temples are typically pentagonal, representing the five major deities:

**The Five Siblings**
- [[Jeevali]], the goddess of life, rebirth, home, and family; often the major diety associated with temples that are the center of worship in villages and small temporary settlements across [[Dunmar]].
- [[Aagir]], the god of war, fire, and death; protector of soldiers and defender of honor of the Dunmari. 
- [[Sonkar]], the goddess of beauty, truth, artisans, and justice. 
- [[Laka]], the god of knowledge, agriculture, and the seasons; often associated with centers of learning.
- [[Chidya]], the goddess of nature, the land, animals, and weather; worshiped especially by herders and shepherds and those who live a nomadic life.

The Dunmari also acknowledge the power of the creator gods, [[Shurat]] and [[Sampa]], and worship several demigods and heroes:

### Creation Story

What follows is the creation story of the Dunmari, told in brief.


First there was chaos, an ever changing, roiling sea of magical energy. Into this formless expanse, two gods came: Shurat, Mother Sky, and Sampa, Father Earth. Together, Shurat and Sampa shaped the world. From Shurat, the rains came, and the sun, and they brought life and growth to the barren earth. From Sampa came the soil, the land, the solidity of the ground, but also death and the darkness below. 

  

After they formed the world, Shurat and Sampa had seven children: first, their two mortal children, shaped from the wind and the earth: Mavata and Pitava, the first humans. Then, their five Divine children, Jeevali, Laka, Aagir, Sonkar, and Chidya. Pleased, Shurat and Sampa created a land for these humans to dwell, far across the sea. Here, they prospered, and learned to be human, sheltered and safe in the protection of the gods. 


in this myth, Shurat is Ahra, Sampa is Malik, and the land created for the humans is Hkar


This land was a land of many gods and many people, a land of peace and plenty. But it could not last. The Five Siblings told their people, the Dunmari, that they had a great purpose, a special place in the world outside. It was time to venture forth and choose to reach for their destiny. So the Dunmari left, departing the sheltered land of their youth, and journeying across the sea.  


this is the mythologizing of the original Dunmari migration from Hkar, before it fell


After many generations, many years of living and dying in this new land, there came a period of upheaval and danger. During this time, a leader was born, named Bhishma, whom some said had the soul of Mavata, the first woman. She told the people that the Gods called them north, that a land would be given to them and their destiny fulfilled.

  
this is the myth as told in current day Dunmar; other descendants of the original Dunmari who left Hkar but did not migrate north tell different tales about Bhishma

### The Afterlife

The souls of those who die journey to a great expanse, an endless, featureless plain in all directions, where they are offered a choice: accept the judgement of the gods, or fade away. judgement not really right here, idea should be that “impure souls” just cannot tolerate the closeness of the gods, and must be purified/redeemed


Those who accept judgement go to Arkaash, the realm of the Five Siblings:

- Not “traditional” heaven or hell, rather a bit of a mix, with a soul’s experience of the power and glory of the Five Siblings dependent on how they lived their life. 
    
- Playing with ideas of light/dark, two-sided; the chosen in the light, those not worthy in the dark, but with a way to get to the light, possibly incorporating ideas about reincarnation; maybe distance from the hall of the gods is key distinction?
    
- The “bad side” isn’t a place of torture or punishment, but more purgatory-like, a way to give your soul a path to a better future
    
- Fading would be “giving up”, admitting you had no chance of redemption, and would be seen as the “real hell” 
    
- Incorporate some ‘halls of ancestors’ ideas, a bit of Wakanda spirit plane stuff; the ancestors are part of the larger community of the gods + people, just have moved to the “gods” side of things
    
- A mortal traveler in the realm of the Five Siblings would find what, exactly?
    

### Key Tenets

The Dunmari believe several key tenets:

- The gods created the Dunmari as their particular people, and thus the Dunmari religion and the Dunmari people are not separable; those who are chosen are Dunmari, even if they turn their backs on their homes. There is no clear sense of a Dunmari religious identity that is apart from just a Dunmari identity, and vice versa. Part of this is seeing the particular Dunmari pantheon as the special protectors of the Dunmari as a people; while of course other gods exist, and may even listen to individual Dunmari, those other gods do not have the interests of the Dunmari as a community in their hearts.
    
- The Five Siblings and the Dunmari people are in community with each other, and much of Dunmari religious practice emphasizes this community. The gods are the protectors, guardians, and guides of the people, and the people are the instruments of the gods. 
    
- Anyone in covenant with the Five Siblings can be Dunmari, so immigration/conversion is not frowned upon, but it also isn’t encouraged. The communal side of Dunmari worship is a reflection of being part of the community, so even outsiders who live among the Dunmari and aren’t Dunmari themselves often participate in the communal rituals while worshipping their own gods in private (e.g., many dwarves in Askandi and Tokra follow this path, as do many Chardonians and others in Darba). But there is no sense that conversion glorifies the gods or increases their power or anything.
    
- The Five Siblings have a purpose for the Dunmari, and the Dunmari exist as a people to fufill this purpose. The exact nature of this higher purpose isn’t always clear, and communication from the gods is rarely straightforward or direct. Mystery cults seeking esoteric knowledge to explore the god’s desires and intentions are a major part of Dunmari religion. But this knowledge is seen as secret, protected, because if the gods wanted all the people to know exactly their purpose they would just share it directly.
    

- In current day Dunmar, there is much debate about whether this purpose was served already in defeating Cha’mutte, or whether there is yet another task left to them, or whether their purpose is more complex than one great war.
    

### Regional Variation


The later history of the Dunmari, post fall of Drankor, features two schisms. 

- Some people did not follow Bhishma north, and remained on the edges of the desert; these are the SouthDunmari
    
- Others followed Bhishma, but turned east instead of west, and settled on the shores of the Green Sea, south of Cymea and around the mountains to the southeast; these are the EastDunmari
    
- The SouthDunmari and Dunmari are the significant majority of all Dunmari, with the EastDunmari a minority. 
    
- However, the SouthDunmari and the EastDunmari remained much closer to each other, and more connected, while the Dunmari diverged, so from a religious point of view there is basically the “Bhisma” branch and the “original” branch of the religion
    

## The Gods of Dunmar

The Dunmari focus their worship on a number of different gods, of various types and powers. 

### The First Gods

#### Shurat

The Sky Mother, one of the two creator gods. Not directly worshipped; seen as distant and uninvolved in the world, having gifted it to her children and moved on. Associated with creation and birth, though. The Dunmari name for Ahra.

#### Sampa

The Earth Father, the other of the two creator gods. Not directly worshipped; like Shurat, seen as distant and uninvolved. Associated with death and endings. The Dunmari name for Malik.

### The Five Siblings

#### Jeevali

The goddess of life, rebirth, home, and family. Often seen as the eldest and most important of the Five Siblings, a first among equals. The peacemaker between the sometimes fractious relationships among the four other siblings. In the west, seen as the patron god of Dunmar for her role in making the land what it was before the Great War. Generally looked to in times of trouble. Seen as the mother of Dunmar, as the protector of the people, as the one who chose the Dunmari for their great purpose. She especially watches over births, the home and family, and the harvest, and is the one who is seen as ensuring the monsoon rains come when they should.

  

She is depicted as…… Her symbol is…..

#### Laka

The god of knowledge, history, time, memories, of the seasons, of the ancestors, and the passage of the year. Often seen as the keeper of traditions, as the one who determines the right moment for things, of the god of beginnings and endings. He is seen as the “cool head” among the Divine Siblings, the one counseling for caution and certainly and less risky courses of action. He is often seen as the second most important of the Divines, after Jeevali, and the one who is the keeper of Dunmar’s “soul”. He especially watches over funerals, and the memory of ancestors, and is the protector of the ruler of Dunmar and the government. The one who understands the reason for things.

#### Aagir

The god of war, fire, and death. He is the protector of warriors, the fierce defender of the honor of Dunmari and of his siblings, the god of battle, and also the god of redemption, the one who helps the souls of those who were not deemed worthy in life redeem themselves. He is seen as the “rash” brother, the one urging action, the one prone to righteous fury and a demand to make things better. He watches over warriors most of all. 

  

He is depicted as….. His symbol is…..

#### Sonkar

The goddess of beauty, artisans, truth, and justice. She is the dispassionate one, the one who weighs the deeds of souls coming to the realm of the Five Siblings. She is also the protector of artisans, smiths, and other craftspeople, and is seen as the one who watches over commerce and trade, punishing cheaters and ensuring fairness. She is the guardian of judgment in life as well, and watches over trials and the law. 

  

She is depicted as…… Her symbol is…..

#### Chidya

The goddess of horses, animals, but also nature, the land, weather, love, outcasts, and wanderers. She is the wild spirit, usually seen as the youngest and most carefree of the Five Siblings. She protects those who travel, and especially horses whom she loves most of all. She is seen as the bringer of unseasonable weather, of things out of time, of chance encounters on the road. She is the patron of outcasts and those in love. Although not the most central to Dunmari history, she is often seen as the most approachable of the Five Siblings and is the focus of much popular worship for this reason.

### Demigods

In addition to the Five Siblings, Dunmari tradition acknowledges a small number of demigods. These divine beings, lesser in power than the Five Siblings and the focus of much more limited worship, nonetheless have an important role in Dunmari society. They are, for the most part, seen as the semi-mortal children of the Five Siblings, and are uniquely Dunmari; the other peoples to the east who also worship the Five Siblings do not typically worship demigods. In many ways, these demigods reflect the close connection between the Dunmari people and the gods themselves.

#### Shakun

The goddess of illusion, magic, prophecy, and dreams; often said to be the mystical protector of the Dunmari, looking to unseen dangers and magical threats. She is the Divine twin sister of Kotana, the second Samraat of the Aatmaji dynasty; Shakun and Kotana are said to be the children of Bhishma, the founder of Dunmar, and the god Laka. The mystai of Shakun have always been associated with omens and dreams, and interpreting the signs of dangers lurking for the Dunmari. 

#### Adra

The god of secrets, the quiet night, and darkness, a loveable trickster and patron of outcasts and misfits and lovers. He is the child of Chidya and a mortal, although who the mortal is no one can seemingly agree on. 

#### Kotana and Bhishma

Although not technically a god, Kotana, child of Bhishma and Laka, as well as Bhishma herself are honored in many parts of Dunmar, and have their own mystery cults dedicated to their worship and preserving their memories. Many believe that Bhishma and Kotana sit at the right hand of the gods now and can reach out to grant small miracles themselves, but the metaphysical truth of the matter is not know.

## Worship

Dunmari worship practice is focused on two main distinct but equally important sets of rituals and traditions, one communal and one individual/familial, with a third strand of ritual practice associated with mystery cults. 

  

The Dunmari see themselves as in communion with the Five Siblings, who are part of the Dunmari community. Temple practice, public festivals, and monuments represent the outward facing, communal aspects of worship, celebrating and giving thanks for their community with the gods. Personal prayer and family practice, on the other hand, is focused on individual needs, giving thanks, asking forgiveness, offering prayers for guidance and aid, and how individual relationships with one or more gods are celebrated. Finally, mystery cults explore the esoteric, secret side of the gods. Some focus on understanding the will of the gods, the hidden divine knowledge of the higher purpose of the Dunmari people. Others focus on achieving greater communion with the gods, through esoteric practices that can only be taught by direct instruction from master to initiate. 

### Temple Practice

The focus of worship practices that take place at temples is the community. Ceremonies about joining and leaving the community -- coming of age rites and funerals in particular -- take place at temples, as do communal acts of thanksgiving and prayer. 

  

Most Dunmari have traditionally not lived in villages, being instead dispersed across the landscape and only coming together occasionally, temples also are often some of the most significant permanent structures in the Dunmari landscape. Because of this, they are the focus of the community, and because of the intertwined nature of the state and the religion, temples also serve as the backbone of state administration. 

#### Temples and Monuments

Temples are often some of the most significant permanent structures across the Dunmari landscape, and the temple communities that grow up around them have traditionally been the focus of state administration. Many of the traditional roles of government -- taxation, taking a census, resolving disputes and administering the law -- are organized around temples.

  

Architecturally, there are several different temple styles in Dunmar. The traditional style, which describes most temples in Dunmar, is a pentagonal building, with an entryway at one corner and altars to the five siblings on the five walls. Jeevali’s altar is usually placed opposite the entryway. More elaborate designs add wings to two or more of the other corners, and elaborate on the entryway, extending it into a nave of sorts. These additions often house administrative or state functions. Many temples are also part of complexes that included living quarters for the priests and administrative space for state purposes, such as meeting chambers, private council chambers, and storerooms. 

  

All these designs, though, reserve the central space, surrounded by the gods, for the community, with the idea that the Dunmari are surrounded and protected by their gods. This is the space used for community rituals, but also for public trials and pronouncements of judgement, and other public functions of the state. The most common organization has pews facing Jeevali, but this is not the only arrangement, and some elaborate temples even have moveable pews. 

  

Shrines to individual gods, although rare, do also exist. Typically, these are not freestanding buildings or places of worship, but rather parts of other buildings. Most commonly, shrines to Aagir are often present in fortresses and other military buildings, but libraries or other places of learning may have shrines to Laka, hospitals shrines to Jeevali, and so on. Unlike temples, these usually don’t have altars and are not typically set up as areas of public worship. Instead, they have statuary, larger and more permanent versions of the icons that people carry as their personal tokens of the gods, and are generally semi-private spaces for personal prayer and reflection. 

  

Shrines to individual gods, as part of cult complexes and monasteries, are also a significant component of mystery cults. These buildings are invariably dedicated solely to the god of the mystery cult, although they often contain shrines or icons to the other gods as well, and are always part of a larger complex of buildings that serve the cult.

  

The third style of religious architecture common in Dunmari culture are monuments. These vary in style and purpose, but are united by a few features. Most importantly, these structures usually give thanks for a specific thing: the life of a great person, an important victory, or another notable event. These typically are not specifically miracles, but reflect important moments in Dunmari life, and the monument serves to thank the gods for their role in achieving success. 

  

The most common monuments are associated with the ruling Samraats, as elaborate monuments are often used as a way of signaling the power and favor of the Samraat and thus the people. Sometimes the Samraat is buried in their monument, and they become royal tombs; this is particularly the case for the Aatmaji dynasty, whose royal tombs outside Kharsan are notable, other times they are more like shrines, and often they are pure monuments with no secondary purpose or function. But these are not the only kind of monuments, and others have grown up around various significant events in the past.

#### The Priesthood

The priesthood of the Five Divines is, in many ways, inseparable from the Dunmari state. The Samraat, as the acknowledged representative of the gods on Taelgar, is formally the head of the priesthood. Officially, the Samraat controls all priestly appointments, and has the power to both assign priests to temples and dismiss priests from their posts. They are in principle supposed to use this power in accordance with divine guidance, and judiciously. Historically, these judgements, especially for important temples, were usually made in conjunction with an informal council of priests of notable temples. And in practice, the current priest of a temple tends to choose a successor, and only rarely is that choice rejected, at least for most of the small community temples scattered across the land.

  

More recently, this tradition has changed somewhat, especially in the west, as the civil bureaucracy has grown larger, and the Samraat court has sought more direct control. Now, the head priests of major temples are often asked to retire when a new Samraat comes to rule. A growing class of emeritus priests now exist in the west, who lack a traditional role in Dunmari society. In the east, many now do not even present the choice of a new priest to the Samraat court for official approval, instead turning to the local leaders to ratify the choice. 

  

Like much of Dunmari society, there is no real hierarchy below the Samraat. Again, in principle, all priests are equal in the eyes of the gods, although of course those who run historically important temples or temples in large cities have a lot more political power than those in small, out of the way places. But there is no formal system of hierarchy in between the Samraat and the local priest.

  

Small temples are often run by just the priest, usually with one or more acolytes, and almost always with at least a few lay assistants, who are generally involved in the administrative side of the temple. Larger temples, especially those in big cities, are still run by a head priest, but may have associate priests to assist, and a much larger body of acolytes and lay assistants. 

  

Entry into the priesthood is universally through training and study with an existing priest, and it is typically assumed that a priest will be divine-touched, usually meaning they have access to some form of divine magic, although sometimes this could mean they are particularly skilled at reading the signs of divine will. Most priests have a personal connection with a specific god, but theologically this is not supposed to influence their role in leading the community in communion with the entire Divine Family. 

  

Reflecting the sense that priests are in some sense one of the divine family, they are referred to as Brother or Sister. 

  

The only formal, religious role of priests is to preside over festivals and public rites. In practice, most are also community leaders and civil administrators as well as religious figures. 

### Personal Prayer 

Despite the central role of temples in Dunmari society, most worship does not occur at them. Daily prayers, contemplation, and thanksgiving, as well as many personal and family rites, occur instead in personal or individual shrines.

  

Although these are called shrines, physically they are portable icons and statuary of the gods. Most people have one of each of the Five gods, although some will have multiple versions, and occasionally individual travelers will just carry one. Mostly these are small icons, often statutes, that are easily portable and can be carried anywhere and set up easily to form a sacred space. 

  

Daily prayers, family rituals, and even acknowledgement of festivals among travelers who cannot return to a village or temple happen before these icons. They are sometimes seen as part of the family, and some have been passed down for many generations, although occasionally they will be cremated with the deceased as a way to ensure the spirits of the dead reach the halls of the gods. 

### Rites and Rituals

Rites and rituals in Dunmari culture are separated into communal rites, which take place at temple, and private rites, which take place before the family shrine. 

  

The most important communal rite is the coming of age ceremony, which is a major marker of adulthood and reflects the choice of the original Dunmari to leave Hkar and seek their destiny. This ceremony is usually celebrated about once a year at each temple, with all those who reach the age of adulthood in the past year participating in a communal ceremony. 

  

Birth and marriage, in contrast, are seen as private rites. Naming and marriage ceremonies require no witnesses beyond the gods, and are usually celebrated as family affairs with just the family icons to give witness of the gods. 

#### Funerals

  

Funerals have some aspects of both private and communal rites. The private goodbye, the farewell to the body, is a family ceremony that involves the cremation of the dead, happens soon after death and is a private rite; in part this is practice, due to the difficulty of being able to return to a temple immediately. But the real funeral, the farewell to the soul, takes place later, at a temple, and is usually a communal affair, where many souls are welcomed into the halls of the gods at once. 

  

In the Dunmari tradition, the first rite of death, the farewell to the body, must take place as soon after death as is practical. This rite is the private goodbye, the time of mourning and sorrow to say farewell to the dead as they embark on their journey to the Afterlife. Bodies are burned in funeral pyres, often with small tokens to help them on their journey, especially things that remind the soul of the good they did in life, or remind them of the gods. Sometimes the small icons of the Dunmari gods that most Dunmari carry are burned as well. If a person had a particular vice that might keep their spirit from leaving for the Land of the Dead, this may also be burned, usually placed at the bodies’ feet, to remove the temptation to stay. Usually the ashes from cremation are scattered before 10 days have passed, but sometimes they are kept and interred in temple crypts during the second rite.

  

The second rite of death happens later, often much later, as part of a communal ceremony. There is no strict time limit, but it must happen at least 10 days after death, and usually happens within a year of death. This is a ritual carried out in a temple, where candles are lit for each soul being celebrated, and the colors of the flames are interpreted as indicating the final disposition of the soul. This communal funeral is usually followed by a celebratory feast honoring the dead. As part of the ceremony, small mementos of each dead soul are often created as a way for those close to the dead person to keep the memory of their soul near (not sure about this).  

### Festivals

- Festivals play a major role in Dunmari culture. They are not just religious celebrations, but moments when the normally widely dispersed community comes together. There are usually markets, games, and other community events around the religious rituals. A few major festivals are celebrated by communal gatherings, including sometimes the return of wandering communities to fixed temples, but many others are celebrated in smaller groups or marked by private household rituals and prayers
    
- The cycle of Dunmari festivals and feast days runs from January to January, with the new year marked around January 15th. 
    

- The Festival of Rebirth (April, first full moon after the vernal equinox, the beginning of summer): celebrating Jeevali’s resurrection. This is one of the most important festivals of the the year, and is almost always associated with large communal fairs and celebrations around temples, and the coming together of dispersed communities. Strongly associated with Jeevali and Bhishma.
    
- The Feast of Bhishma (two day festival, first new moon in June, the end of summer): a celebration of Bhishma’s ascension to godhood, as well as the founding of Dunmar. The first day is a day of remembrance, the second is a pure celebration, a feast and party holiday, usually celebrated with family and kin, not necessarily involving travel back to villages or temples. However, it was a time when the Mystai of Bhishma gathered for their annual council and gathering. This is usually around the summer solstice.
    
- Day of Renewal (the day following the first arrival of the monsoon): a day marking Jeevali’s tears, the sacrifice and renewal of the land they represent. No fixed date, but this festival is acknowledged on the day following the first monsoon rains of the season. It is a day of reflection and personal prayer, and also a day of thanksgiving to the gods. Many people will save some special treat or drink for the evening meal on the Day of Renewal, but otherwise is often a very personal feast day. 
    
- Jaankar (Chidya’s Day) (July 21-22, when the month of the summer solstice is over): a celebration of life, of the next generation of animals, and also of wildness and spontaneity. Celebrated for two days, first by ceremony and thanks for the next generation and the life of horses, lambs, and the other animals on which the Dunmari depend, and then from sundown to sundown a wild party. 
    
- Aagirvala, or the Festival of Aagir’s Spear (first full moon after the autumnal equinox): a day to mark victory in battle, but also remember and acknowledge the viciousness of the war of conquest of the Dunmari, and remember those killed in anger. Can be a tense holiday, as it also has strongly nationalistic vibes. Celebrated with feats of strength and endurance, and tournaments, and skill at weaponsmithing.
    
- Needs a name - harvest festival / feast of slaughter (early November based on lunar calendar): celebrates the harvest, associated with special food and when animals are slaughtered before the dry seasons / winter, associated with feasting, not particularly with the gods
    
- Sonkar’s Day / Day of Atonement (Dec 21st, winter solstice): a day of prayer, atonement, and judgment before Sonkar, which starts the last month of the year which is seen as particularly holy and a time when many gather when food is plentiful after the bounty of the rainy season. 
    
- Sun Festival (Jan 22nd): end of the winter solstice, start of new year
    
- Laka Day: after sun festival, celebration of the northward journey of the sun, ??
    
- 1-2 more in Feb/March, between Laka Day and Festival of Rebirth
    

### Mystery Cults 

  

All the major gods, as well the minor gods Shakun and Arda, and several significant semi-divine dynastic rulers, including Bhishma and Kotana, have mystery cults associated with them. For the Five Siblings, the mystery cults are more like monastic orders in some ways: they tend to be adjacent to, but not supplant, the public worship of these gods in main temples. While all have headquarters, Mystai of these major gods are spread out and there are multiple monasteries dedicated to each major god.

  

The mystery cults of the minor gods and semi-divine historical figures are much more likely to be the only form of worship of these gods, and to be associated with one particular place with little or no affiliation among different Mystai.

  

So, while the Lakan Mystai have a major monastery near Tokra, a few smaller monasteries exist in other places across the country, functioning almost like branches of the Tokra monastery. In contrast, the Temple of Shakun in Karawa is the only place where Shakun is worshipped. 

  

All mystery cults are associated with magic and miracles, although the manifestation of this varies from cult to cult. 

  

## ROUGH NOTES

The Festival of Rebirth (old see session for final)

A major event in the Dunmari religious calendar is the festival of rebirth, celebrating the rebirth of Jeevali. This festival has its roots hundreds of generations ago, before the Dunmari came north; in their ancestral homes, it was associated with the start of the planting season. During the height of Dunmari power, it became associated with birthing season of animals. Now, with the weather changed and the land drier and more arid, the festival of rebirth is associated with the flowering of the desert in the late spring, when there has been enough rains in the winter, and the gathering of herders to trade before dispersing widely during the dry, hot summers.

The festival centers around outdoor shrines to Jeevali. All Dunmari have a shrine to Jeevali somewhere, even if it is just a small statue carved of wood next to the campfire of a lone traveler. These shrines protect sources of water, keeping them safe from drying up or being contaminated. In larger villages, elaborate shrines stand watch over public fountains. Permanent shrines are always living things, growing often in incongruous places.

The festival begins in the evening, when the old shrine to Jeevali is burned, along with sacrifices and appeasements to Jeevali, asking her to return and bless the people. This is a solemn ceremony of prayer, followed by fasting, with some religious devotees and priests of Jeevali keeping vigil.

In the morning, the fast continues. A quiet procession through the city happens midday, with offerings to Jeevali given to the temple. The rich and powerful show their status with elaborate outfits and generous donations, although poor shepherds and herders typically also give what they can, as participation is seen as a way to guarantee Jeevali's blessing for the household.

After the procession, public prayer continues at the shrine, and many people go to gather small tokens (desert flowers, seeds, feathers, reptile skins from molts, anything associated with rejuvenation, new life, etc) to place at the growing shrine. This continues until dusk, when a crowd gathers, and prayers are said. A chant starts at this point, coursing through the gathered people, and as the chant continues, if Jeevali's blessing is with the people, the shrine starts to grow. All the gathered tokens begin to coalesce, vines and green shoots sprout from the ground, and water begins to seep through the growing shrine. 

With this, a celebration starts -- in good years, when the shrine Jeevali is particularly impressive, these can last all night. 

The week following the Festival of Rebirth typically is a time for large, organized entertainment. In many communities, games and contests of strength and dexterity are held; in others, plays are performed. Markets spring up and people trade and make money. In a good year, wine and money flows freely; in a bad year, suspicion and dread replace them.

The rich and powerful show their status with elaborate outfits and generous donations, although poor shepherds and herders typically also give what they can, as participation is seen as a way to guarantee Jeevali's blessing for the household.

After the procession, public prayer continues at the shrine, and many people go to gather small tokens (desert flowers, seeds, feathers, reptile skins from molts, anything associated with rejuvenation, new life, etc) to place at the growing shrine. This continues until dusk, when a crowd gathers, and prayers are said. A chant starts at this point, coursing through the gathered people, and as the chant continues, if Jeevali's blessing is with the people, the shrine starts to grow. All the gathered tokens begin to coalesce, vines and green shoots sprout from the ground, and water begins to seep through the growing shrine. 

With this, a celebration starts -- in good years, when the shrine Jeevali is particularly impressive, these can last all night. 

The week following the Festival of Rebirth typically is a time for large, organized entertainment. In many communities, games and contests of strength and dexterity are held; in others, plays are performed. Markets spring up and people trade and make money. In a good year, wine and money flows freely; in a bad year, suspicion and dread replace them.

  

FESTIVAL

  

A major event in the Dunmari religious calendar is the festival of rebirth, celebrating the rebirth of Jeevali. This festival has its roots hundreds of generations ago, before the Dunmari came north; in their ancestral homes, it was associated with the start of the planting season. During the height of Dunmari power, it became associated with birthing season of animals. Now, with the weather changed and the land drier and more arid, the festival of rebirth is associated with the flowering of the desert in the late spring, when there has been enough rains in the winter, and the gathering of herders to trade before dispersing widely during the dry, hot summers.

The festival centers around outdoor shrines to Jeevali. All Dunmari have a shrine to Jeevali somewhere, even if it is just a small statue carved of wood next to the campfire of a lone traveler. These shrines protect sources of water, keeping them safe from drying up or being contaminated. In larger villages, elaborate shrines stand watch over public fountains. Permanent shrines are always living things, growing often in incongruous places.

Story of Jeevali:

The festival of rebirth is a celebration of a major miracle. The story goes that when the Dunmari first settled the land, it was dry and dead, a barren landscape cursed by the plague. The people suffered, and died, from drought and hunger and fear. Jeevali wept for her people, crying tears that poured from the heavens, cleansing the land and purifying the soil. But as she cried, she put so much of her power and spirit into her tears that she began to fade away. She diminished, and was gone. 

For a year, the people prayed, singing her name every day, calling to her, begging her to return. The first harvest, grain was sacrificed. The first lambs and calves and foals were sacrificed. As the winter rains fell gently on the land, the people prayed and chanted her name. In the spring, as new life began to grow from the fertile soil, Jeevali appeared as a XXXX symbol, the power of the belief of her people restoring her.

Since then, the Dunmari have celebrated the Festival of Rebirth, marking the founding of Dunmar, the grace of Jeevali in saving the people, and the miracle of her restoration.**
