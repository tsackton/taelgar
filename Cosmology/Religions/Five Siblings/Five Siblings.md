The religion of the Dunmari is an old religion, adapted and evolved from the old ways when the Dunmari were a nomadic people living far to the south, before they settled among the ruins of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]]. The Dunmari worship a family pantheon, the Five Siblings, along with other minor gods and goddesses. Dunmari temples are typically pentagonal, representing the five major deities:
