%%notes
Mystery cult dedicated to Shakun.

Primarily charged with protecting the eastern border of Dunmar, via the Heart of Shakun and Shakun's Protection.

Also tend to the living mesa, growing healing powders and potions from it.

Temple and numbers detail:  Pre-attack, the Temple of Shakun supported a community of about 130 initiates, and another 40 or so laity, of which 20 were in training to be initiated.

After the gnoll attack, most of the laity fled to Tokra, along with some portion of the older, younger, and infirm initiates. This left about 85 initiates and 10 laity left.

Another handful died in various attacks (second gnoll attack, then ankhegs and the rest), and a few more left for Tokra with Havdar's lieutenant and Alesh, who went to bring news of Havdar's band leaving east and the orc sightings to the rest of the troops and refugees in Tokra.

Now, 70 mystai, mostly more senior initiates remain, along with 6 laity, all warriors of various kinds.%%
