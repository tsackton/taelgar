# The *kestavo*

The *kestavo* is the ancient religion of northern Sembara and the Highlands, and is still practiced in some places in the highlands. It is a religion focused around small gods, the spirits of villages, streams, and hills, who are celebrated in their communities. These spirits, the kestavo, bring the prayers of their communities to [[Ako]], the Divine. 

Although most kestavo are worshipped only by the people of their particular town or village, some kestavo have gained great fame and pilgrims come from far and wide to their shrines to ask for blessings to be passed along to [[Ako]]. These include:

* [[Romil]], the glacier king, with his shrine in the tallest mountains in the north
* [[Kamak]], the lurker, who dwells at the bottom of the great Lake Kamchak
* [[Besla]], who came to the land in the ancient days from the Green Sea, and each spring asks Ahra to send the waters of her homeland to her for company, and thus brings the monsoon rains.

The kestavo are not the only spirits in the land, however. The cruel west wind, [[Ziva]], and [[Vacla]], the fire-below, have many offspring, the vazska. These spirits must be appeased or driven off, or they bring misfortune. The children of Ziva are the spirits of the cold and dry air, of hardship, shortages, and mischief, and although they are not worshipped, they are placated and bribed to stay away. The children of Vacla are the spirits of war and destruction, of injury, of sudden death, of the burning home. They are feared and driven off, whenever possible.  

## The Kestavan Religions

At the heart of Kestavan practices is the local shrine, the home of a kestavo. Each spirit has a home in a specific place, usually a shrine, and watches over the inhabitants of that place. Within their homes, they have great power, and can bring the blessings of [[Ako]] to their worshippers. But their domains are small, and limited to what is nearby their homes. The kestavo do not live in great heavenly palaces, watching over all of Taelgar; they live in small shrines, tended by the community, local places of devotion. A few kestavo, of great fame, live in two, three, or even a dozen shrines, but no spirit can divide itself too much without dispersing on the winds, an unquiet ghost. And so to gain the blessing of even the greatest and most famous kestavo, one must travel, to their shrines. 

In the ancient days, many kestavo were known far and wide, and pilgrims would come to their great shrines, which became centers of highland culture. Today, many of these shrines are abandoned, the kestavo gone. Only a few of the most famous kestavo still attract pilgrims, and mostly only in the far north of [[Zovcka]]: [[Romil]], the glacier king, with his shrine on the slopes of the [[Sentinel Range]]; [[Kamak]], the lurker, who dwells at the bottom of [[Lake Kamchak]], and has shrines dotting the shores; and [[Besla]], who came to the land in the ancient days from the [[Green Sea]], and each spring asks [[Ako]] to send the waters of her homeland to her for company, and thus brings the monsoon rains.  

As the Drankorian traditions of [[Mos Numena]] spread, many adopted the new religion with its powerful divines, but held to some of the ancient traditions. Others held to the old ways, and kept the local shrines.

## Traditionalist Practice  

Most practice is focused around local shrines, invariably thought to house a specific spirit, who is believed to inhabit a specific object, feature of the landscape, or similar. That is, kestavo have specific physical homes in specific objects or places, which must be protected as they provide the gateway through which a kestavo can influence/help the world.  

A new town/community must attract a protector spirit, either because one is already living in the land, or by getting one from an existing shrine to agree to live in two places. Great ceremony around this and very formal establishment of a village / group based around this.  

Some spirits watch over many villages, and are therefore much more powerful… but also, much less focused on any one village.  

Most practice is centered around maintaining the shrine; specific worship doesn’t necessarily occur in the shrine, but it is the house of the god, literally. It is very important that it be well kept, clean, decorated. Sometimes, this means a building -- but if the kestavo lives in a waterfall in the forest, it might mean ensuring no one draws the water or something. The practice also includes specific rituals around giving prayers and wishes to pass on to [[Ako]], and practices and rituals to scare off or bribe the children of Ziva.   

Each kestavo also can only carry prayers to [[Ako]] if they are nearby. This leads to both pilgrimages to specific shrines as well as a great importance on having a shrine in each community, as a center of worship. A new village cannot be established if no kestavo will watch over it.

Note kestavo have no extraplanar presence. This makes everything click - it is why they can’t grant prayers themselves, for example.  I do think this would imply that there are not faded kestavo drifting around the astral plane. Instead there would be places in Taelgar with ghost gods.

Tim's ideas here, which I want to incorporate:  
the actual game mechanics don't really matter -- and if a player ever wanted to be a cleric of the Kestavo you could make up an exception -- but the basic idea that kestavo are strong in their communities and really weak elsewhere, and that clerics follow the same pattern, both explains why the mariner people originally converted to the kestavo, and then why most of sembara dumped them for the eight divines.  
  
also helps explain why Drankor never really conquered the highlands. like, if you imagine something like all clerics can prepare 1/2 level extra spells and cast all spells at one level higher than the slot they expend within a mile of the shrine of their gods, but cannot prepare spells >3rd level and prepare only 1/2 spells per level (instead of 1) if away from home. would make them really hard to conquer, but also make it very difficult for the religion to spread far or go on the offensive.  
  
like, I can imagine a bunch of nature paladins wandering around the highlands dropping 2nd and 3rd level smites on Drankorian armies, well in excess of their actual class power (since I generally imagine that, while there are many people with 1-3 class levels, there is a big drop through level 5, and a much bigger drop after that).%%

Personal shrines are rare -- there is little point in having a shrine if the kestavo doesn’t inhabit it, and the rituals to coax a kestavo to establish a second home are long and complex. So some rare homes have personal shrines, but most do not. Some shrines are not in communities, when the kestavo happens to be attached to a natural place that no people live. Most notably, neither Romil nor Kamak live near human settlements.

Vazska don’t have homes -- they are the children of the west wind, and everywhere. Rituals around them are mostly in the form of bribes or threats to keep them away. Sometimes people ask them to bring curses on their enemies etc. 

%%Priests are the companions of the kestavo in some way, supposed to be close to them and keep them happy. Most priests live at or near the shrine, to be near to their god. Several types of relationship

- Spouse -- some priests are seen as the spouse of the god (maybe even true? Would a human be able to have a child with a kestavo? Could that be the source of some of these spirits? Maybe not a good idea… )
    
- Adopted child - esp with the larger and more important kestavo
    
- Adopted sibling - more common with the smaller and more local kestavo
    
- Rarely, parent - most common when a very senior priest is establishing a new shrine and coaxing a new kestavo to move to an area or to develop from the general spirit of the land
    

  

Other thoughts:

- Perhaps some degree of subtle realization that worship does in fact create gods? Not that anyone would know specifically, but maybe there are some cultural elements around ‘birthing’ a kestavo with the idea that a particularly unique feature can be almost grown into a kestavo with the correct set of rituals
    

- In modern day many kestavo have faded back into the land, likely gone forever (or are they? Maybe there are some truly minor spirits, effectively dead gods, but still with a little power to curse a stream, or bless a stream, or something. Little magical features of the landscape that don’t inspire belief but water that cures disease, or a stand of wood that is said to be cursed and anyone trying to cut it down comes to a bad end, or whatever)
    
- Some still survive in the traditional way, and also a handful of the ‘major’ kestavo are still around, their ancient shrines still maintained in northern Vostok or Zovca, and perhaps some of the major kestavo are rattling around in an abandoned shrine, all but dead, but still with some faded energy from the belief in the place. Almost ghost-gods.
    
- The vazska are much more widespread. Perhaps in much of the north, including many places that are fully converted to Mos Numera, there is still a culture of evil spirits that come with the west wind, and that you leave out a small bribe in winter to keep away from your house

one thing to think about: what is the afterlife / what happens to souls?   
  
basic Taelgar metaphysics is that when you die, your soul goes to "The Land of the Dead" (in need of a better name), where it lingers and then fades, unless collected by a god (or demon or devil) within about 10 days (based on raise dead time limit).   
  
presumably the kestavo, not being powerful in their own right, don't have a "heaven".   
  
some ideas:   
1) the souls of those who follow the kestavo really do just fade  
2) the kestavo pull the soul back to them on taelgar, and it is either reincarnated or becomes part of the kestavo. would have very different implications for the culture  
3) the kestavo are, in some sense, connected to or part of or children of a primordial god, probably the "Earth mother" or Arborea, and that god collects the souls of those who follow the Kestavo  
4) something else?

I was thinking about this from a belief perspective rather than a metaphysics perspective—  
  
The idea I had was the belief at least is that three things might happen to your soul:  
If you are buried near your kestavo and you have respected the kestavo and tradition, you are it’s companion in some sense and dwell with it  
  
On the other hand, if your body isn’t buried near the shrine, or you’ve angered a vazska, you might get carried off by Ziva to be an unquiet ghost lost in the wind.  
Finally some souls are taken to the fire-below, the source of volcanoes and hot springs  
  
Haven’t really thought the last one fully through obviously sounds quiet a bit like Christian hell. Mostly I was thinking it isn’t a punishment, it is a danger to be avoided. That is even good people can end up there, if they say die in battle and are never brought home (would make recovery of bodies very important)
