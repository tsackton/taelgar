## Sembara
In Sembara, the cultural inheritance from the kestavan tradition has resulted in a strong cultural attachment to burial, although the Drankorian Mos Numena tradition ties the burial to the end of the ten day period of watchfulness, rather than the beginning.

So the Sembaran funeral tradition begins with preparing the body, usually embalming it, which is one of the key responsibilities of the temple system. This is followed by a series of prayers and rituals to the 

and a series of prayers and rituals to invite the divines to open a door for the soul into their realm. For the next ten days, the soul is on a journey towards this open door. This journey is often seen as dangerous, and although there are both ritual activities and private grief during this period, no public funerary events take place until ten days have passed. The most important ritual is during the first day after death, to guide the transition into the Land of the Dead. The rest of the ritual experience during the ten-day is largely about supporting those still living through their grief and the added challenges of having to wait for the soul to make this transition through the Land of the Dead. But these religious events are seen as private, and often between the grievers and the gods, directly.

This should probably be true for all Mos Numena traditions

This would also be the crucial ritual to perform for lost bodies, missing in action, etc, with variations depending on the certainty of death.

  

Burial in the churchyard is seen as helping the soul on its journey, and so often the burial takes place, quietly and with few mourners during the ten-day, and then the funerary rite and remembrance of the dead takes place at the grave site, but not as part of the burial itself, after the ten days have passed.

Rarely, during the ten-day, signs or portents from the gods will hint that a certain unexpected god is guiding the soul, and usually that indicates the burial should be in a place consecrated to that god, if at all possible.


What is real? The gods really do have to let souls into their realms, a soul cannot force its way. But the Sembaran superstition that the wrong activities will disrupt the soul’s journey during the ten day journey is mostly just that, a superstition. But in some metaphysical way, the attention of the living is a key component of reducing the danger of the journey, so in a way, the superstition is real, in the sense that if everyone just pretended like the journey wasn’t happening, it would in fact make it harder for souls to make it to the outer realms.

  

What about missing bodies? The Sembaran view is somewhat of a balance between the kestavo tradition and the Drankorian tradition. The burial of the body in consecrated ground is certainly desirable, but there isn’t the same sense as there is within the kestavo that without a connection to a physical locus of the god, the soul is likely to be lost. The Sembaran tradition is somewhat, I imagine, like the Christian tradition. Burial in a churchyard is good, but also new holy spaces for burial can be created relatively easily, and the gods are fairly ubiquitous, so it isn’t like a battlefield on the edge of the Plaguelands is out of reach of the eight, and it could certainly be consecrated and made holy for the burial of those who died in battle.
