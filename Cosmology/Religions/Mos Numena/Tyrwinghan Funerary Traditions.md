## Tyrwinghan Funerary Traditions

The Tyrwinghan religious traditions are very similar to the Sembaran, and much of the Tyrwinghan experience of death is the same as the [[Sembaran Funerary Traditions|Sembaran]]. However, there are a few cultural differences. The largest one is around the attitude around burial. 

In Tyrwingha, stories prevail of fey boons bringing the dead back to life. But usually, these fey miracles require a body. So the tradition of burial has persisted much more commonly in Tyrwingha.
