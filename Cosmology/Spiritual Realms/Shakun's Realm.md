%%^Campaign:dufr%%
Shakun's Realm, as taught by the [[Shakun Mystai]] who guard the eastern borders of [[Dunmar]], is a demiplane of divine power, created by the goddess [[Shakun]] and connected to the [[Material Plane]] by the physical manifestation of [[Heart of Shakun|her heart]] and [[Red Mesa|her body]]. To the enemies of Dunmar, who find themselves pulled by [[Shakun's Protection]], this realm is a maze of rocky, broken badlands and twisting canyons, from which there is no escape. To the Dunmari who travel there, it is something else, but none can say exactly what, for the plane appears as [[Shakun]] herself wishes it. 

Few among the [[Shakun Mystai]] bother to attempt to classify the mystery of [[Shakun]] as the planar geographers and other scholars on the [[Faculty of Metaphysics]] might, though if they did, it would likely be thought of as a demiplane of the [[Divine Realms]], spun of [[Soulstuff]] and the [[Plane of Creation]], anchored to the [[Material Plane]] by the physicality of Shakun herself, and the echoes of her mother [[Bhishma]], who was born as a mortal. 

Shakun's Realm is accessible from [[Shakunâ€™s Wellspring]], on the southern edge of the [[Red Mesa]], where a portal exists that is open for a short time around dawn and dusk each day.
