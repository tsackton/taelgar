# Spiritual Realms

In the [[Standard Multiversal Model]] taught by the [[Faculty of Metaphysics]] at the [[University of Chardon]], the Spiritual Realms are defined as the planes that exist within the matrix of the [[Astral Plane]], and that exist on the far side of the [[Land of the Dead]] from the [[Material Plane]]. These are largely congruent with the [[Outer Realms]] of [[Yendalism]], although Yendalists also include the [[Land of the Dead|Divine Veil]] and the [[Plane of Creation]] as Outer Realms. 

Most theological cosmologists postulate that the Spiritual Realms, unlike other planes, are spun out of [[Soulstuff]] itself.
