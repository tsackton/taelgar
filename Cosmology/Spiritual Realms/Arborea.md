# Arborea

Arborea is the plane of wildness, nature, and beasts, a place where the beauty of vast untouched landscapes coexists with the terror of the hunt and the chaotic energy of overgrown jungles. It is an ancient realm among the [[Outer Realms]], not associated with any particular divinity.

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
There is a known [[Extraplanar Weak Point]] connecting Arborea to the [[Material Plane]] underneath the [[Lakan Monastery]], south of [[Tokra]].

%%original story tbd but feels like this might predate even the age of divinity and perhaps have some kind of origin in the Riving?%%
