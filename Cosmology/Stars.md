# Stars

%%^Campaign:none%%

There is relatively little recent brainstorming on what the stars are. 

There is a fair bit of old (high school era) thoughts:
- [[Guide to Taelgar (v2)]]
- [[Guide to Taelgar (v3)]]

(and much more in paper notes, about proto-astrology ideas)

In current thinking, the main important thing is that, canonically, some people can be made into demigod-like beings as part of being transformed into constellations. cf. [[Fox and Hunter]].

This brainstorming idea may or may not be true:
Constellations and stars shift during the night and during the seasons, but some are fixed in the sky and don't process in the same manner against the background of stars.

The fixed constellations are usually magical / special in some way. Some are connections to other planes, or souls who found a way towards immortality by getting themselves into the sky. This can be pretty unclear for now.

In general, the world of Taelgar is curved, but whether it is a globe or something else is unclear and indeed impossible to know. No one has circumnavigated the ocean, for example.
