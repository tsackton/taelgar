The Dreamworld is a place about which much has been written and little is truly known. The Dreamworld is considered an [[Echo Realms|Echo Realm]] of the [[Plane of Souls]] in the [[Standard Multiversal Model]]; the fundamental plane of imagination in the writings of [[~Famous Tyrwinghan Scholar~]]; the realm of prophecy and locus of connection to the guidance of the ancestors to [[Lizardfolk]] mystics; and is described by the [[fey]] as a plane of vibrant wildness where those of strong mind can shape the dreams of others in the writings of [[Camilla of Drankor]]. 

It is said that everyone who travels to the Dreamworld perceives something different and unique to themselves, making any attempt at scholarly categorization and study difficult, if not impossible. As the classic Drankorian text [[On Metaphysics]] says: *The Dreamworld is a strange echo of the [[Plane of Souls]], a place where time is unpredictable and all the imaginings of all the sentient beings who have or ever will live are reflected in dreams.*

This was written in high school but remains a fairly accurate conception: The Dreamworld is a realm which contains echoes of the present, past, and future blended together. Prophecy, and the ability to sense the past associations of an object are strongly tied to connections to the Dreamworld. The Dreamworld can also, under the influence of a powerful master, be used to send messages, influence dreams, and similar things.   

Beyond this basic framework, the Dreamworld is intentionally left somewhat undefined, and can vary from group to group and experience to experience, so any kind of invention about a specific journey to the Dreamworld is likely consistent with metaphysics. Often, play experiences in the Dreamworld work best away from standard game mechanics (e.g., travel to the Dreamworld in Hralgar's Palace ([[Session 73 (DuFr)]]) involved a story-based challenge mechanic).

There are a few, limited canoical points to keep in mind when designing Dreamworld experiences in play:
- You can enter the dreamworld directly, through some kind of portal or magic, but also by passing through the [[plane of souls]] (which is mechanically essentially astral projection) - this is how for example Candrosa's Dream Staff worked
- The Dreamworld is supposed to be somewhat unstuck in time, and also controllable by the strong-willed. So, for example, this is how Hralgar make a "dreamworld palace" that looked like his old home but was not actually. Or how e.g. Kenzo and Rai could meet and speak in dreams. Or how time travel happened in the high school campaign.
