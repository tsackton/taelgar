The Feywild, classified as echo of the [[Material Plane]] by the [[Faculty of Metaphysics]], and given many other names by countless poets, travelers, scholars, and storytellers, is a land of magic and emotion, a place of contrasts and illusions where the truth is rarely what it seems.  

and given many other names  is a place where the mundane world shimmers with magic and emotion, and where truth is as fluid as the laughter of its inhabitants. Unlike the distant Elemental Planes, the Feywild is deeply intertwined with mortal lives; countless legends, songs, and whispered tales speak of fleeting encounters with its strange, beautiful, and dangerous denizens. While scholars debate its exact nature, its undeniable presence permeates the arts, folklore, and even the politics of Taelgar.

> [!quote] *Beneath the Boughs*, one of the many sonnets written by [[Thomas Hawke]]
> Beneath the boughs where twilight shadows play,  
The fey spin bright, their songs a siren’s call.  
Through glens of gold and meadows wrapped in gray,  
Their laughter weaves a spell to bind us all.  
>
>The shifting woods bewitch all guiding light,    
>As time dissolves within this haunted glade.  
No dawn will break to end eternal night,  
Where bargains made demand the price be paid.

>Fair beauty shrouds the thorn and hides the snare,  
>With shimmering hues that veil a darker scheme.  
>Beware, O heart, for wonder masks despair,   
>And joy dissolves like mist within a dream.

> 'Neath shadowed skies, the endless whispers weave,  
> The mournful songs of those who cannot leave.

The echo realm of the fey, home to the realms of the Archfey and the [[Fey]]
## Locations

The politics and political organization of the Feywild is based around the realms of the Archfey, such as [[Shimmersong]], [[Amberglow]], [[Fortune's Rest]] or other lesser known realms.

The layout and terrain of the Feywild very loosely matches the layout and terrain of the material plane of Taelgar; so where there are big mountain chains in Taelgar, there are usually mountains of some kind in the Feywild. But this matching is very loose, and often based more on vibes or history than physical geography. 

Roughly, the locations of the following Fey realms are known:
- [[Fortune's Rest]] is superimposed on the area southeast of [[Chardon]], roughly including the southern reaches of [[Elderwood|the Elderwood]], the [[Yeraad]] river valley, and the lowlands leading to the [[Myraeni Gap]]. 
- [[Shimmersong]] is east of [[Fortune's Rest]], covering roughly the [[Myraeni Gap]] and the southern reaches of the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], extending into the northern part of the Dunmari plains. 
- [[Amberglow]] stretches east and south from [[Shimmersong]], centered on the [[Kharja]] river valley and extending south into the [[Garamjala Desert]], as well as east towards the Istaros drainage. 
- [[Dreamhaven]] is north of [[Fortune's Rest]], centered around the ancient elven kingdom of [[Ainumarya]] and the northern reaches of the [[Chasa]] river valley.
- [[Whispervale]] is north of [[Dreamhaven]], roughly congruent with the lands now occupied by the northern Deno'qai, along the edge of them mountains.
- [[Splendor's Gleam]] is a small realm, roughly congruent with the northern edge of Lake Valandros and the southern part of the [[Voltara]] plains. 
- [[Wildrun]] is north and west of [[Splendor's Gleam]], roughly congruent with the Tawir Forest and the Mawarkel Peninsula.
- [[Sharpspire]] is north of [[Shimmersong]] and west of [[Duskmire]], and is centered around [[Urlich Pass]]. The realm has fallen since the [[Great War]] and is now a no-mans-land
- [[Duskmire]], is east of [[Sharpspire]] and north of [[Amberglow]], centered on the western parts of [[Sembara]] and the [[Duchy of Maseau]]
- [[Twilight's Grace]], the domain of [[Archfey Ethlenn]], congruent with [[Tyrwingha]]

%% Notes on how the feywild works: 
    
-   Distances are very different in the Feywild than in Taelgar. Two portals to the Feywild could be 1000 miles apart in Taelgar and only 100 miles apart in the Feywild, or vice versa. 
    
-   Time works strangely in the Feywild. First, there is no night or day; the sun does not move in the sky. However, as you go further west it gets more and more "morning" and as you go further east it gets more and more "evening". So for example, there is a point in the far east where it is constant midnight, and a point in the west where it is always dawn. Second, the Feywild itself is somewhat timeless -- it is hard to track the passage of days without the sun moving, for example. When you travel between the Feywild and another plane, it is never clear how much time will have passed. The same thing is true for journeys in the Feywild itself - moving from one location to another might take a week, but then going back might take only a day.
    
-   The feywild runs on emotion: flowers might wilt if an argument is happening, or bloom if people are laughing nearby 
  

The fey themselves also follow specific rules and customs.

-   The feywild runs on bargains and gifts. The fey don't really use currency, and the place is magical enough that food, water, and shelter are simple to obtain, albeit often with a cost as unknowingly eating the bounty of a fey lord's domain can also bind you to their service. Generally speaking, going back on a deal is a huge crime in all domains across the feywild, and can get you cursed in nasty ways. In some places, the culture is to try to weasel out of things or take as much as you can by being as literal as possible (e.g., if you say "Can I have your name?" implying you just want to know what it is, and someone says "Sure, it's So-and-so", you. might literally take their name away from them). In other places, the culture is much more friendly and less mischievous / tricksy. However, this is balanced by reciprocity and hospitality - taking something from someone, or accepting a gift, binds you to them and you must then give them something of approximately equal value in return to maintain the balance.
    
-   Many fey also cannot or will not tell an outright lie, although they will happily lie by omission or implication. Generally speaking, this is the fey of medieval folklore, of the original fairy tales, not so much the Disney-esque modern versions. 

-   Pretty much all of the feywild is part of realms of various Archfey and Fey Lords. Each fey lords domain can be fairly different - some have glittering courts, even cities, while others are extremely wild, and many are in between; some are largely pleasant and friendly, others hostile or malicious. Some are pretty strict about policing their boundaries, others let anyone pass, still others are hidden and cannot be found by ordinary means. The transitions are often not obvious to non-fey (but all fey can easily sense these borders) and catching someone trespassing is an easy way the fey lords use to lure the unknowing or unwitting into deals and bargains.
    
-   The archfey and fey lords that rule the domains of the feywild generally owe their allegiance to either the Seelie Court or the Unseelie Court. While crudely considered "good" and "evil" fey by unknowing [[Humans]], the real differences between them are subtler and more complicated, with the Seelie Court generally associated with protocol and the trappings of civilization, and the Unseelie Court generally associated with indulgence of primal instincts and a much more chaotic vibe. There are also independent archfey that shun the conflict of the Seelie and Unseelie courts and hold themselves neutral.

### Overview

  

The Feywild is a place of strange magic and deep emotion. Some basic facts of the layout and workings of the plane are detailed here:

  

- The layout and terrain of the Feywild very loosely matches the layout and terrain of the material plane of Taelgar; so where there are big mountain chains in Taelgar, there are usually mountains of some kind in the Feywild. But this matching is very loose, and often based more on vibes or history than physical geography.
    
- Distances are very different in the Feywild than in Taelgar. Two portals to the Feywild could be 1000 miles apart in Taelgar and only 100 miles apart in the Feywild, or vice versa. 
    
- Time works strangely in the Feywild. First, there is no night or day; the sun does not move in the sky. However, as you go further west it gets more and more "morning" and as you go further east it gets more and more "evening". So for example, there is a point in the far east where it is constant midnight, and a point in the west where it is always dawn. Second, the Feywild itself is somewhat timeless -- it is hard to track the passage of days without the sun moving, for example. When you travel between the Feywild and another plane, it is never clear how much time will have passed. The same thing is true for journeys in the Feywild itself - moving from one location to another might take a week, but then going back might take only a day.
    
- The feywild runs on emotion: flowers might wilt if an argument is happening, or bloom if people are laughing nearby
    

  

The people of the Feywild are generally referred to as fae or faerie as a whole, but within that category there are distinctions both obvious and subtle. 

  

- The most common fae are the humanoid, generally human looking people just know as “fae”. The fae are usually elegant and grace humanoids, generally human-like or elf-like in appearance, who could pass for humans in the right circumstances, although usually their eyes and demeanor give them away. In game terms, these fae can use either the Eldarin race, the homebrew Fae race, or the Changeling race (for now). 
    
- The sometimes mischievous, sometimes helpful, and always magical flying fairies are also found in the feywild. These fey are usually small, and include creatures like the pixies, sprites, brownies, and the playable Fairy race. 
    
- The original archfey, at the dawn of the multiverse, were responsible for the awakening of many animals. Some of these now inhabit the Feywild as beastfolk of various kinds. Most famous and most common are the horned satyrs; rarer are the harengons (rabbit-folk) and owlins (owl-folk), and perhaps other creatures. While many of these fey have a fixed animal form, others are more like humans with animal features. In game terms, the playable Satyr, Harengon, Owlin, and Shifter races would be of these beastfolk lineages.
    
- Centaurs were created by the archfey in the early days of the multiverse, just as satyrs and others. However, when the feywild was separately from the material plane, the centaurs stayed, becoming tied to the world of Taelgar itself, seeing themselves as the guardians of Taelgar. In the current day, most centaurs remain in the material plane, traveling and protecting the land of Taelgar itself. However, they are fey creatures, and some do find their way back to the feywild, for various reasons. In game terms, these are represented by the Centaur race. 
    
- Throughout the feywild, there are also innumerable dryads, nymphs, and other spirits of the land. These fey are typically strongly tied to a particular place, rarely traveling. 
    

  

The politics and political organization of the Feywild is based around the realms of the Archfey. 

  

- Pretty much all of the feywild is part of realms of various Archfey and Fey Lords. Each fey lords domain can be fairly different - some have glittering courts, even cities, while others are extremely wild, and many are in between; some are largely pleasant and friendly, others hostile or malicious. Some are pretty strict about policing their boundaries, others let anyone pass, still others are hidden and cannot be found by ordinary means. The transitions are often not obvious to non-fey (but all fey can easily sense these borders) and catching someone trespassing is an easy way the fey lords use to lure the unknowing or unwitting into deals and bargains.
    
- The archfey and fey lords that rule the domains of the feywild generally owe their allegiance to either the Seelie Court or the Unseelie Court. While crudely considered "good" and "evil" fey by unknowing humans, the real differences between them are subtler and more complicated, with the Seelie Court generally associated with protocol and the trappings of civilization, and the Unseelie Court generally associated with indulgence of primal instincts and a much more chaotic vibe. There are also independent archfey that shun the conflict of the Seelie and Unseelie courts and hold themselves neutral. 
    

  

The fey themselves also follow specific rules and customs.

  

- The feywild runs on bargains and gifts. The fey don't really use currency, and the place is magical enough that food, water, and shelter are simple to obtain, albeit often with a cost as unknowingly eating the bounty of a fey lord's domain can also bind you to their service.

### Realms of the Feywild

  

Shimmersong

  

The fey domain of Shimmersong is a land of bright colors and vivid magic. It is hilly terrain, with pillars of bright gems, crystal forests on rolling slopes, glittering caves, spiders that spin webs of diamond. There is the occasional mountain, and the occasional hidden valley of lush plant life in rich, multicolored soil. Mostly it is a riot of color, and full of oddities that mix crystals/gems with living things, so there might be trees on which ruby apples grow, or a crystal tree that produces real citrus, or a deer with antlers of silver instead of bone.

  

Lord Egon, the Lightdancer (they/them pronouns) is a vivacious, almost madcap ruler, obsessed with the vibrancy of their domain. Anything dull, flat, colorless, is considered out of place, and the Lightdancer can transmute life to crystal or crystal to life with their touch, turning lemons into topaz or emeralds into juicy fruits. 

  

But Egon has a dark side, and for some time each year they retreat to hidden caves underground, color fades from the domain, and many of the vibrant plants and animals of the realm turn to stone and metal. There is a stark, winter beauty to this time, but for many in Shimmersong it is hard, and for those who would wish the denizens of the domain ill it is an opportunity. 

  

To keep the domain safe during the dark times, the Lightdancer has company of Winter Knights, a group that rarely emerges during the bright days of light and song, but revels in the harsh beauty when the Lightdancer retreats, and keeps the domain safe from anyone who would take advantage.

  

The people of Shimmersong are grateful to the Winter Knights, but most are eager for the Awakening, the ceremony of springtime that marks the Lightdancer’s return and honors the work of the Winter Knights during the days of grayness and sleep. 

  

Fortune’s Rest

  

The fey domain of Fortune’s Rest is a sparsely inhabited land of pleasant forests and peaceful meadows, seemingly quiet and still, until one finds or is drawn to the Court of the Chanceweaver, Prince of Luck. 

  

The court set on a vast estate of rolling hills, meadows and gardens, all filled to the brim with a riot of games and dazzling color. Dice games of all kinds, card games, even lizard races, anything one can gamble on can be found among the attractions of the Chanceweaver’s Court. Food and music flows freely, and the happy veneer of the elegant fey keeps visitors from seeing the people lurking in the shadows, who have gambled away their names, identities, memories, and even luck itself. 

  

The Chanceweaver’s court is difficult to leave, for each way you turn a new attraction tempts you to return. Those who partake in the food and drink often find they have spent days or weeks in a daze, though the natives of the Feywild are largely resistance to this effect. 

  

Amberglow

  

On the southern and eastern borders of Shimmersong is the fey realm of Amberglow. Once a place of great beauty, a land of constant sunsets and golden skies on wide open plains of amber grasses and lush flowers, it has fallen into decay.

  

The queen of Shimmersong, known as the Cloudspinner, the Queen of Sunsets, vanished, and in her absence the realm decayed. Though some servants and allies of the Cloudspinner’s court remain, most of the realm is a place few dare tread.

The Feywild, an echo of the Material Plane, is a place where the mundane world shimmers with magic and emotion, and where truth is as fluid as the laughter of its inhabitants. Unlike the distant Elemental Planes, the Feywild is deeply intertwined with mortal lives; countless legends, songs, and whispered tales speak of fleeting encounters with its strange, beautiful, and dangerous denizens. While scholars debate its exact nature, its undeniable presence permeates the arts, folklore, and even the politics of Taelgar.

> [!quote] An excerpt from _The Midnight Grove_  
> When twilight falls and moonlight hums,  
> The fey arise from shadowed glens.  
> Their songs are sweet, their laughter wild,  
> But tread with care, O mortal child.
> 
> For paths may twist, and time may stray,  
> And debts of dreams demand their pay;  
> Yet beauty calls where danger weaves—  
> A timeless land that none believe.

## The Geography of the Feywild

The Feywild mirrors the Material Plane, but only loosely. Mountains rise where their Material counterparts stand, and rivers flow along paths similar yet alien. However, the land shifts with emotion and memory rather than geography, creating contradictions that defy logic. One traveler may report the lush meadows of _Fortune’s Rest_ as a serene expanse of blooming flowers, while another claims to have crossed the same ground through an eerie forest of spectral trees. Both accounts may be true—or neither.

Distances in the Feywild are equally mutable. A portal in the mountains of Chardon might lead to a glittering city atop a crystal spire, while another, mere miles away, opens into the murky bogs of _Duskmire_. Yet in the Feywild, these realms could be next-door neighbors or separated by days of travel. Time flows just as strangely: merchants leaving _Whispervale_ for a day’s journey may return to find generations have passed—or discover that the Feywild itself has reshaped their path entirely.

Travelers speak of the plane’s eternal light, where the sun never moves but radiates its essence differently across the land. The westernmost reaches are cloaked in perpetual dawn, soft and golden, while the east descends into eternal twilight, a dim and foreboding realm where shadows stretch long and secrets fester.

## The Inhabitants of the Feywild

The fey themselves embody the contradictions of their home: they are enchanting and unsettling, generous yet cruel.

- **Archfey and their realms**: The Feywild’s politics revolve around the Archfey, whose domains are extensions of their power. _Shimmersong_, ruled by Egon the Lightdancer, is a vibrant land of crystalline forests and gemstone rivers. By contrast, the decayed plains of _Amberglow_ mourn the vanished Queen of Sunsets, its once-lush fields turned to brittle gold.
- **Lesser fey**: Pixies, satyrs, dryads, and nymphs are common denizens, often tied to a specific place or purpose. They can be as whimsical as a prankster sprite or as predatory as a bog nymph luring travelers into the _Duskmire_.
- **Beastfolk and changelings**: Harengons, owlins, and shifters trace their origins to ancient Archfey who shaped them from animals. While many serve their creators, others roam freely, carving their own destinies.
- **The Seelie and Unseelie Courts**: The Seelie Court celebrates beauty, protocol, and structured magic, while the Unseelie Court revels in primal chaos and indulgence. However, both courts are dangerous, their laws and bargains binding in ways mortals often fail to understand.

Rumors persist of beings outside these structures: solitary Archfey who shun both courts, immortal hunters who guard the Feywild’s borders, and entities so ancient they predate the Feywild itself.

## Rules and Contradictions

The Feywild runs on rules that often contradict mortal understanding.

- **Emotion shapes reality**: The land responds to feeling; joy might cause flowers to bloom, while sorrow can twist a path into an impassable maze. This makes the plane deeply unpredictable.
- **Bargains bind**: To make a promise or accept a gift without repayment creates an inescapable bond. Many mortal tales end in ruin when a hero unwittingly accepts the hospitality of a fey lord.
- **Truth and lies**: While many fey cannot tell outright lies, their truths are often twisted or incomplete, leaving mortals to decipher meaning from riddles.

## Art and Lore of the Feywild

The Feywild inspires mortal imagination more than any other plane. Unlike the distant myths of the Elemental Realms, the Feywild appears in countless plays, poems, and ballads. Tales like _The Siren’s Embrace_ tell of mortals ensnared by fey lovers, while _The Eternal Masquerade_ portrays a courtly ball where a mortal dances for a century, only to return as an old man with no memory of his time away.

Even scholarly texts like _Through the Archways_ and _Lyrannis’ Survey of Fey Lords_ acknowledge their limitations, often citing contradictory reports and dismissing some as romantic embellishment. The plane’s nature ensures no single account can encompass its entirety.

## Realms of the Feywild

The Feywild is divided into countless domains, each shaped by the Archfey who rule them. Some realms are glittering courts filled with splendor and intrigue, while others are wild, primal expanses.

- **Fortune’s Rest**: A seemingly idyllic land of meadows and groves, home to the Chanceweaver’s Court, where games of luck determine fates.
- **Shimmersong**: A vibrant land of crystalline forests and gem-laden hills, ruled by Egon the Lightdancer.
- **Amberglow**: A realm of eternal sunsets, once lush and golden, now decayed and lifeless after the Queen of Sunsets vanished.
- **Duskmire**: A shadowy expanse of glowing marshes, said to be home to cunning Archfey who delight in ensnaring the unwary.
- **Whispervale**: A tranquil land of perpetual dawn, where the whispers of ancient trees reveal truths—if one can decipher their meaning.
