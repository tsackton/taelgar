The Mirror Realm is a hypothesized echo realm, a place of reflections and mirrors where alternate, twisted versions of the past, present, and future dwell in a strange conglomeration of infinity possibilities. 

While rumors and speculation about this realm can be found in scholarly works across Taelgar, there is no firm proof of its existence. Some speculate that this is because the natives of the Mirror Realm quietly replace all who find their way in.
