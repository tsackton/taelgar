One theorized mechanism that can create [[extraplanar weak point|extraplanar weak points]], or similar kinds of extraplanar incursions. Thought to be the after effects of the death of powerful beings that exist across planes, such as [[Dragons|elder wyrms]]. 

[[Cha'mutte]]'s death in DR 1545 was thought to scatter seeds of chaos across the [[Plaguelands]], responsible for the curse that lingers on that land.
