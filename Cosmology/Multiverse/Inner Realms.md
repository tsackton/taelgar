The Inner Realms are the name for the collection of planes that are contained within the bounds of the [[Land of the Dead|River of Souls]]. These include the [[Material Plane]], as well as the [[Energy Realms]] and the [[Plane of Souls]].

The Inner Realms were, generally speaking, created during [[Events/Ancient/The Riving]] and are associated with the living. Dead souls cannot naturally sustain themselves on the Inner Realms side of the [[Land of the Dead]]. The Inner Realms are also distinct in that the energy of the Riving still echoes around them, creating the magic that sustains the [[Echo Realms]]. 

Contrast with the [[Outer Realms]].
