# The Land of the Dead

The place variously known as the Land of the Dead, the River of the Souls, and the Divine Veil, among many other names, 

The vast gathering place for the souls of the dead. When a consciousness, or soul, dies, it fades from the [[Plane of Souls]], but does not immediately disappear into nothingness. 

Most (although not all) instead drift towards the Land of the Dead, which has many names and many descriptions in different cultures, human and non-human alike. Here, the souls of the dead drift, waiting. Some, those who are not claimed by any god or being of similar power, eventually fade away into nothingness, becoming part of the essence of the place itself. Others are taken up into spiritual realms.

The Land of the Dead also serves as the veil that separates the divine realms from the rest of the spiritual realms.

The Land of the Dead has a number of important impacts and details.
### Resurrection Magic

*These are guidelines for how resurrection magic interactions with the journey of the soul.*

- _Revivify_ can only bring back a dead creature before its soul has departed the material plane and entered the Land of the Dead. This usually happens quickly, hence the 1 minute limitation on _Revivify_ although spells like _Gentle Repose_ can suspend the journey of the soul for a time. 
- _Raise Dead_, _Reincarnate_, and other spells that have a 10 day limit can retrieve a soul from the Land of the Dead and restore it to the body (or a new body), but cannot find a soul that has passed beyond the Land of the Dead into the Spiritual Realms beyond, or a soul that has faded from existence. Note the key limitation of these spells is the Land of the Dead component, and while this should typically take 10 days (this is the traditional understanding of the length of the journey of the soul in most religions), it can be longer or shorter depending on the in-world context. 
- _Resurrection_ or _True Resurrection_ or _Wish_ are the only spells that can bring back the dead once the soul has passed on beyond the Land of the Dead, and of these only the 9th level spells can restore a soul that has faded from existence, because for example it was not taken up into any of the [[Spiritual Realms]]. The time restrictions in these spells is not related to the journey of the soul, and should be interpreted in-world more as limitation on what magic can do, in my opinion. 

## Travel to the Land of the Dead

- To use Plane Shift to travel to the Land of the Dead requires as a material component the body of a person whose soul is currently in the Land of the Dead (so generally someone dead < 10 days). 
- It is dangerous to remain in the Land of the Dead for long. You cannot benefit from a long rest, and you cannot eat, drink, or sleep (but this does not prevent you from getting tired, hungry, and thirsty). So anyone trapped in the Land of the Dead will quickly die, usually from dehydration. Even if you somehow avoid these more mundane dangers, time in the Land of the Dead saps the will of the living to live, and eventually everyone who is trapped here dies. What happens to your body if you die in the Land of the Dead is not clear (it isn't like there are bacteria or scavengers for it to decompose; probably the [[Gidari]] deal with it somehow).
