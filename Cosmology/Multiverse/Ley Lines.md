Ley lines are the scars of the [[The Riving]], when the arcane energy of the [[Plane of Magic]] was ripped from the material plane, leaving behind a patchwork mess of scars through which arcane magic still leaks into the world, for those with skill to channel. 

%% note: at one point I made up a bunch of mechanical impacts of ley lines, but I'm not sure that level of detail is useful or necessary. %%
