# The Shadowfolds

The Shadowfolds are series of echo realms, domains of undeath, despair, sorrow, or other curses and evils, created from the echos of the [[Material Plane]] by powerful events of evil. There are many such domains, and unlike the [[Feywild]] they do not connect in a single, cohesive realm: it is, generally, not possible to simply walk from one domain to another. 

However, all of the Shadowfolds share the property of being an echo realm of the Material Plane. 

%% vibe is influenced more by Ravenloft and D&D Domains of Dread than the traditional D&D 5e Shadowfell %%
