# The Echo Realms

Of all the scholarly topics concerning the [[Multiverse]], by far the most contentious and debated is the nature, and even existence, of what are called the Echo Realms in the [[Standard Multiversal Model]]. These planes are traditionally defined as the extraplanar realms that are reflections, distortions, or echoes of another plane, and thus do not have a unique existence of their own. 

### The Standard Model

Historically, this concept was first developed by the Drankorian scholar [[Theophesus]], who collected some of the first maps of the [[Feywild]] and proposed a physical correspondence: a mountainous region in the [[Material Plane]] is likely to be echoed by mountains, or something like mountains, in the [[Feywild]]. In later writing, he linked the [[Dreamworld]] and the [[Plane of Souls]] in a similar way, considering the Dreamworld to be a metaphysical echo, analogous to the physical echo of the Feywild. 

Some time later, [[~Chardonian Famous Scholar~]], one of the most prominent early metaphysical cosmologists in the [[Faculty of Metaphysics]], proposed to unify the old Drankorian concept of [[Demiplanes]] with the Echo Realms. She proposed one of the first unified theories of the [[Multiverse]], which grew into the [[Standard Multiversal Model]]. In this model, the fundamental duality of the [[Material Plane]] and [[Plane of Souls]] still echo with the powerful magic of the [[Riving]], which separated the [[Energy Realms]] and the [[Plane of Magic]] from the [[Material Plane]]. This echoing energy both shaped the permanent Echo Realms, and still resonates, allowing powerful magic users to shape it into pockets of extraplanar space, although these usually cannot persist for more than a minute or so. Thus, in [[~Chardonian Famous Scholar~]]'s model, as adopted by the [[Standard Multiversal Model]], there are numerous Echo Realms, some of which are fully co-extant with their source plane (as the [[Feywild]] is with the [[Material Plane]]), while others are only partially co-extant (as, for example, the domains of the [[Shadowfolds]] are thought to be), or temporary (as the minor extraplanar pockets created by magic). 

### Criticisms

The [[Standard Multiversal Model]], however, has been extensively criticized. One of the most prominent criticisms originally came from [[~Famous Tyrwinghan Scholar~]], who vigorously argued that the conception of an Echo Realm requires the designation of a primary, or source, plane and a secondary, or reflected plane, and yet there was no evidence at all to support the idea that, for example, the [[Material Plane]] should be considered primary to the [[Feywild]]. Indeed, he argued that the entire concept of Echo Realms was itself fatally flawed. Instead, we should imagine the existence of four primary realms at the center of the [[Multiverse]], representing the physical world (the [[Material Plane]]), the magical world (the [[Feywild]]), the spirit world (the [[Plane of Souls]]), and the imaginary world (the [[Dreamworld|Plane of Dreams]]). These four realms, he argued, are the only four planes that can be considered complete: they link the magical and the spiritual, and they extend to fill the entire cosmological space.

## Older Notes

The Echo Realms, in the standard model, are 

The Echo Realms refer to the planes that came into existence due to the echoes of the energy of the [[Riving]]. These planes are somewhat mysterious, but are thought to share two key properties. 

First, they are always [[Inner Realms]], and so bounded from the influence of the raw energy of creation by the [[Land of the Dead|River of Souls]]. 

The most well-known of the echo realms are the [[Feywild]], an echo of the [[Material Plane]], and the [[Dreamworld]], an echo of the [[Plane of Souls]]. However, others have been rumored to exist, including the [[Mirror Realm]], the numerous domains of despair, undeath, and dread collectively referred to as the Planes of Shadow or sometimes the Shadowfolds, and the [[Nightmare Realm]].
