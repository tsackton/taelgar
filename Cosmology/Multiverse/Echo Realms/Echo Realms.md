The Echo Realms refer to the planes that came into existence due to the echoes of the energy of the [[Riving]]. These planes are somewhat mysterious, but are thought to share two key properties. 

First, they are always [[Inner Realms]], and so bounded from the influence of the raw energy of creation by the [[Land of the Dead|River of Souls]]. 

Second, they are traditionally thought to be reflections, distortions, or echoes of another plane, and not have a unique existence of their own. For example, the geography of the [[Feywild]] maps, in at least a metaphorical sense, to the geography of the [[Material Plane]]: a mountainous region in the material world is likely to be echoed by mountains, or something like mountains, in the Feywild. 

The most well-known of the echo realms are the [[Feywild]], an echo of the [[Material Plane]], and the [[Dreamworld]], an echo of the [[Plane of Souls]]. However, others have been rumored to exist, including the [[Mirror Realm]], the numerous domains of despair, undeath, and dread collectively referred to as the Planes of Shadow or sometimes the Shadowfolds, and the [[Nightmare Realm]].
