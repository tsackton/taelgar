# Dreamworld

The Dreamworld is a strange echo of the [[Plane of Souls]], a place where time is unpredictable and all the imaginings of all the sentient beings who have or ever will live are reflected in dreams. 

%%
I have some kind of vague ideas about how the plane works, mostly from the Hralgar's Palace dreamworld / finding the phasing stone sessions, and secondarily from the various Stormcaller Tower sessions. The basic vibe is supposed to be pretty unpredictable and idiosyncratic though, so I'm saying this is "color" not "important". 

Two key points:
- You can enter the dreamworld directly, through some kind of portal or magic, but also by passing through the plane of souls (which is mechanically astral projection) - this is how for example Candrosa's Dream Staff worked
- The Dreamworld is supposed to be somewhat unstuck in time, and also controllable by the strong-willed. So, for example, this is how Hralgar make a "dreamworld palace" that looked like his old home but was not actually. Or how e.g. Kenzo and Rai could meet and speak in dreams. Or how time travel happened in the high school campaign.
