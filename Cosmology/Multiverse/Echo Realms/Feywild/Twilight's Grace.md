# Twilight's Grace
>[!info]+ Information
> A realm in the [[Feywild]], the [[Echo Realms]]

The realm of [[Archfey Ethlenn]]. A land of perpetual twilight, but full of sparkling lights, music, and games.

Note: Could potentially have a moonlight connection, but unclear if there is a moon in the Feywild. For now avoid reference/mention of moon until this is determined.

Potential imagery: the horizon glows with faint reflected sunlight, as of an hour after sunset, and the stars above are twinkling and starting to appear,  with the sky above much darker and full of a spray of milkly way type stars

Updates:
1) No moon in the feywild
2) I think that Twilight's Grace should be more about feasting and music and dancing -- while there are games, perhaps, this isn't a casino atmosphere  (in contrast to e.g. Fortune's Rest); this is more like a medieval fair or something. I think this is what you are going for but just double-checking
