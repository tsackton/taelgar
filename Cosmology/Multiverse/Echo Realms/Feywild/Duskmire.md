# Duskmire

A fey realm, the domain of  [[Lord Umbraeth]], often known as the Gloomshaper. Duskmire is a bleak place, a land of endings and cruelty. The sky is often full of clouds, often blotting out the weak sun, constantly hovering on the horizon. Storms race across the realm with some frequency bringing thunder and cold rain. 

The scenery is mixed, with a central core of several very tall mountains,  surrounded by a dense and overgrown forest. Four rivers of brown water flow from the mountains to the east, west, north, and south and beyond the forest the realm is craggy hills and cold moors.

The realm is bordered to the south by [[Amberglow]], to the west by [[Dreamhaven]], to the north by Unnamed Powerful Northern Fey, and to the east by [[Archfey Ethlenn]]'s unnamed realm. 

Lord Umbraeth enjoys sport, and especially cruel sport where the game is rigged and the stakes high. Like all fey, he does not break his deals, but he is often misleading in his explanations and delights in the despair of his victims when they discover his deal was not fair. 

Lord Umbraeth was not always the lord of a fey realm. Thousands of years ago he was a courtier in the court of Ethlenn, where he was held in some respect, even if he was not loved. He organized hunts and was the master of sport, and held grand contests even fifty years. One of these contests went wrong somehow, or someone Ethlenn cared about was involved, or something that led to a major disagreement and eventually his exile. Not sure specific details but presumably something prevented Ethlenn from just killing him. 

This left very bad blood between them, and she sworn him nor any of his court or retainers or those who went into exile with him would ever be welcome in her kingdom again. 

He eventually found some way to found a small enclave nestled in the borderlands between Amberglow and Unnamed Powerful Northern Fey, and his kingdom grew significantly when Amberglow fell.

%% Somewhat complicated motivations -- the darkness and cruelty of his kingdom is part a reflection of his deep unhappiness and desire to be back amongst the glittering twilight of Ethlenn %%
