# Duskmire
>[!info]+ Information

A fey realm, the domain of  [[Lord Umbraeth]], often known as the Gloomshaper. Duskmire is a bleak place, a land of endings and cruelty. The sky is often full of clouds, often blotting out the weak sun, constantly hovering on the horizon. Storms race across the realm with some frequency bringing thunder and cold rain. 

The scenery is mixed, with a central core of several very tall mountains,  surrounded by a dense and overgrown forest. Four rivers of brown water flow from the mountains to the east, west, north, and south and beyond the forest the realm is craggy hills and cold moors.

The realm is bordered to the south by [[Amberglow]], to the west by [[Dreamhaven]], to the north by Unnamed Powerful Northern Fey, and to the east by [[Twilight's Grace]].

Lord Umbraeth enjoys sport, and especially cruel sport where the game is rigged and the stakes high. Like all fey, he does not break his deals, but he is often misleading in his explanations and delights in the despair of his victims when they discover his deal was not fair. 

Lord Umbraeth was not always the lord of a fey realm. Thousands of years ago he was a powerful courtier in the court of Ethlenn, where he was held in some respect, even if he was not loved.

Canon from Addermarch campaign:

There are warning stones in the west of Addermarch, that pre-date Drankorian arrival to the area, written in a strange language with unusual letters - presumably mariner alphabet and possibly Tyrwinghan or Old Tollish. 

These warning stones warn against Lord Umbraeth and against fey incursions, and ward places where the material plane is easy to access from the Feywild. 

Their existence suggests that Duskmire likely existed prior to the arrival of the Drankorians in the DR 300s, perhaps dating to the first generations after the Downfall, around 100 DR.

%% Canon from Cleenseau:
There is a fey portal to Duskmire in Cleenseau wood that is sometimes open and sometimes not.

Umbraeth has taken advantage of recent opening to launch mischief, although details mostly on the [[Lord Umbraeth]] page.

%% Not 100% canonical ...

One of the rules of Twilight's Grace is that fey lords are not allowed to torment humans of Tyrwinghan, there is a degree to which they are under the protection of Ethlenn. 

Umbraeth broke this rule, and in a relatively egregious way, and was exiled by Ethlenn. She agrees not to harm him if he accepts exile graciously and agrees to never return to her kingdom or the [[Twilight Court]], which he accepts. 

Duskmire is originally estabilshed as a small realm south of Twilight's Grace, overlapped the [[Darkwood]], sometime in the 600s.

When Cloudspinner is imprisoned, Umbraeth is able to expand his realm to the west and does so.

When [[Sharpspire]] falls, Umbraeth expands north, and it is in this period that Duskmire covers the [[Cleenseau Wood]] and more of Sembara:

(Area 1 is original, Area 2 is expansion, in several phases)

Further discord chats:
is there anything canonical about when Umbreath established Duskmire? in the Duskmire note you have in the 600s but is that set in stone? 

i'm dropping a warning stone in the next adventure for my Addermarch campaign that is near a place of easy travel (not quite a portal, but a place where fey can cross to the material plane with less effort)
trying to figure out what language the warning signs might be in

Nothing canonical.
But it has to be before Cloudspinner was imprisoned
rsulfuratus — 09/16/2024 8:26 PM
yeah, i was more wondering about pushing it back a bit. 600s would be when Drankor had already established in Addermarch
say to 200 or 300
Deciusmus — 09/16/2024 8:26 PM
For the expansion narrative to work. Could be much older though. Who knows how long Umbraeth was hanging out in the Darkwood
rsulfuratus — 09/16/2024 8:26 PM
so by the time Drankorians arrive, the Ethlenn/Umbaeth split has already happened
Deciusmus — 09/16/2024 8:29 PM
Yeah that probably works
An Excerpt from On Creation and Destruction of Extra-Material Realm in the Cleenseau folder has a few hints
rsulfuratus — 09/16/2024 8:29 PM
will take a look
Deciusmus — 09/16/2024 8:30 PM
But something like 250-300 would work fine.
I think


- originally the idea was duskmire started in the region of the feywild colocated with darkwood
    (and is the source of the "Darkwood" name)

other chats on Discord suggest Darkwood is 'dark' when Drankor arrives

Basically, here is where I think we've landed on Duskmire....

Originally, it was the fey realm concurrent with the Darkwood, which has always been "the Darkwood" even in Drankorian times, for undetermined reasons. This realm was given to Umbraeth by Ethlenn as part of his exile, which is at an undetermined date, but predates Cloudspinner's imprisonment.

Once Cloudspinner is exiled, the opportunity arises to expand to the west, which Umbraeth eagerly does, until he reaches the fortified borders of Shimmersong in the west and the unnamed Ulrich fey to the north.

Then, when the Great War disrupts unnamed Ulrich fey he expands north as far as the Wistel, where he encounters another strong archfey, the big talking animals fey, and west, until he encounters scary thing in the ruins of Ulrich fey
The Sunset Gate runs basically due north from the westeren edge of the Darkwood - through Fellburn and then northward, and is a literal line Umbraeth cannot cross
(where the sun sets)
The lands sunward of the Sunset Gate (in the region labeled 3)  are not part of any domain, but there are several courts and castles of allies of Ethlenn. But this area is also especially treacherous. Time works even more strangely than usual, and without an archfey to bring order to the land, the line of the Sunset Gate is particularly unsettled, so the border between 2 and 3 is a big vague, and thus the eastern border of Duskmire is a bit vague

There are more notes in Discord than copied here.
