%% Largely undefined - may not necessarily exist 

A fey realm north of Duskmire centered on the highland regions of the eastern Sentinels. Currently only needs to exist and be powerful enough to act as a serious constraint on Umbraeth's ambitions.

Idea: place of large talking bears and eagles, wild creatures welcomed, etc

Possbile names:

Beasthome
Nature's Lair
Awakened Den
Nature's Awakening
