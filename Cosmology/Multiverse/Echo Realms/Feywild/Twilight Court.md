From discord:
There is this idea of the Twilight Court, which is noted as unclear canon, but happy for it to exist if it is a relevant idea, which is imagined as a huge party she throws every 25 years or old, inviting all the powerful fey, that is elegant and fancy

I don't expect it is _exactly_ every 25 years; 25 years before 1749 is 1724, which is close enough to my game I could plausibly have one, but also easily enough to say it was in 1718 or 1726 if needed
