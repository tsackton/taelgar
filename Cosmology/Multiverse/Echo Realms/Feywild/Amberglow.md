# Amberglow

A fey realm. 

On the southern and eastern borders of [[Shimmersong]] is the fey realm of Amberglow. Once a place of great beauty, a land of constant sunsets and golden skies on wide open plains of amber grasses and lush flowers, it has fallen into decay.

The queen of Amberglow, known as the [[Cloudspinner]], the Queen of Sunsets, vanished, and in her absence the realm decayed. Though some servants and allies of the Cloudspinnerâ€™s court remain, most of the realm is a place few dare tread.
