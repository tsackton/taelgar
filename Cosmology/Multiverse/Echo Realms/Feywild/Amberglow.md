# Amberglow
>[!info]+ Information
> A [[Fey|fey]] realm in the [[Feywild]], the [[Echo Realms]]

On the southern and eastern borders of [[Shimmersong]] is the fey realm of Amberglow. Once a place of great beauty, a land of constant sunsets and golden skies on wide open plains of amber grasses and lush flowers, it has fallen into decay.

The queen of Amberglow, known as the [[Cloudspinner]], the Queen of Sunsets, vanished, and in her absence the realm decayed. Though some servants and allies of the Cloudspinner’s court remain, most of the realm is a place few dare tread.
