# The Sunset Gate

The name for the line of sunset in the Feywild west of Twilight's Grace and east of Duskmire. It streches from the central part of [[Amberglow]] (to the extent any place in the [[Feywild]] has a "center") north for some distance. It is a line of materialized color - yellows and reds and oranges painted in the sky, but as  physical barriers - like paint brush strokes just sitting in the air. The colors are physical and passing through them is impossible, but they are riddled with cracks and openings. In some places, these cracks are sharp and dangerous, and passing through has weird time effects - sometimes it takes a day or a year to walk through a crack. 

In other places, especially where it passes through the edge of Twilightâ€™s Grace, there are elaborate structures - the [[~Evensong Spire~]] is particularly famous for its immense towers that intertwine with the painted colors of the sunset.

Since [[Amberglow]] fell it has been odder, and less controlled. The colors shift unexpectedly at times, and the time effects are less predictable, and even the safe passages shift time in strange ways. And sometimes dark clouds race along the colors, blotting them out and bringing an unexpected darkness to the land.

Where the Sunset Gate crosses through Duskmire, near the Darkwood, it has been chiseled and worked by [[Lord Umbraeth]] to try to tear it down, but it has instead grown back as a tangled maze of angry reds and oranges, like sharp glass. This part of the Sunset Gate is especially difficult to pass.

The northern parts of the Sunset Gate, north of the [[~Evensong Spire~]] is outside any particular fey domain, althoug the sunward side is inhabited by a number of allies of [[Archfey Ethlenn]] who are charged, among other things, to watch for mischief from the [[Lord Umbraeth|Gloomshaper]].
