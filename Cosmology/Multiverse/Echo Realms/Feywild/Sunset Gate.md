The name for the line of sunset in the Feywild west of Twilight's Grace and east of Duskmire. This region is outside of any particular fey domain, and time is particularly strange here. The sunward side is inhabited by a number of allies of [[Archfey Ethlenn]] who are charged, among other things, to watch for mischief from the [[Lord Umbraeth|Gloomshaper]].
