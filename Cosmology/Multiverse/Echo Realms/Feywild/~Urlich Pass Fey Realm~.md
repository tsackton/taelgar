%% A fey realm bordering Duskmire in the east and Dreamhaven in the west, centered around the Urlich pass and the southern sentinals north of Shimmersong.

During the Great War something bad happened here - probably when Cha'mutte was killed, which caused the realm to fall into chaos.

Lord Umbraeth of Duskmire took advantage of this chaos to expand west, but something out here is scary enough that there is a large buffer between Duskmire and Dreamhaven, and perhaps even scary enough that Umbraeth and Lord Egon work together at times to protect their realms from it
