# Dreamhaven

A fey domain.

Dreamhaven is an ancient forest, full of hidden paths, secret groves, and unexpected discoveries. In places, the forest is bright, lit by the perpetual afternoon sunlight of Dreamhaven, and dotted with sudden meadows of blooming flowers, or towering trees draped with orchids. Elsewhere, the forest grows dense and close, and deep shadows cast a perpetual twilight gloom on the forest floor. The trees shift, and there are few reliable paths through Dreamhaven.
