## The Feywild

The echo realm of the fey, home to the realms of the Archfey and the [[Fey]]

## Locations

The politics and political organization of the Feywild is based around the realms of the Archfey, such as [[Shimmersong]], [[Amberglow]], [[Fortune's Rest]] or other lesser known realms.

The layout and terrain of the Feywild very loosely matches the layout and terrain of the material plane of Taelgar; so where there are big mountain chains in Taelgar, there are usually mountains of some kind in the Feywild. But this matching is very loose, and often based more on vibes or history than physical geography. 

Roughly, the locations of the following Fey realms are known:
- [[Fortune's Rest]] is superimposed on the area southeast of [[Chardon]], roughly including the southern reaches of [[Elderwood|the Elderwood]], the [[Yeraad]] river valley, and the lowlands leading to the [[Myraeni Gap]]. 
- [[Shimmersong]] is east of [[Fortune's Rest]], covering roughly the [[Myraeni Gap]] and the southern reaches of the CentralMountains, extending into the northern part of the Dunmari plains. 
- [[Amberglow]] stretches east and south from [[Shimmersong]], centered on the [[Kharja]] river valley and extending south into the [[Garamjala Desert]], as well as east towards the Mahar drainage. 
- [[Dreamhaven]] is north of [[Fortune's Rest]], centered around the ancient elven kingdom of [[Ainumarya]] and the northern reaches of the [[Chasa]] river valley.
- [[Whispervale]] is north of [[Dreamhaven]], roughly congruent with the lands now occupied by the northern Deno'qai, along the edge of them mountains.
- [[Splendor's Gleam]] is a small realm, roughly congruent with the northern edge of Lake Valandros and the southern part of the [[Voltara]] plains. 
- [[Wildrun]] is north and west of [[Splendor's Gleam]], roughly congruent with the Tawir Forest and the Mawarkel Peninsula.

%% Notes on how the feywild works: 
    
-   Distances are very different in the Feywild than in Taelgar. Two portals to the Feywild could be 1000 miles apart in Taelgar and only 100 miles apart in the Feywild, or vice versa. 
    
-   Time works strangely in the Feywild. First, there is no night or day; the sun does not move in the sky. However, as you go further west it gets more and more "morning" and as you go further east it gets more and more "evening". So for example, there is a point in the far east where it is constant midnight, and a point in the west where it is always dawn. Second, the Feywild itself is somewhat timeless -- it is hard to track the passage of days without the sun moving, for example. When you travel between the Feywild and another plane, it is never clear how much time will have passed. The same thing is true for journeys in the Feywild itself - moving from one location to another might take a week, but then going back might take only a day.
    
-   The feywild runs on emotion: flowers might wilt if an argument is happening, or bloom if people are laughing nearby 
  

The fey themselves also follow specific rules and customs.

-   The feywild runs on bargains and gifts. The fey don't really use currency, and the place is magical enough that food, water, and shelter are simple to obtain, albeit often with a cost as unknowingly eating the bounty of a fey lord's domain can also bind you to their service. Generally speaking, going back on a deal is a huge crime in all domains across the feywild, and can get you cursed in nasty ways. In some places, the culture is to try to weasel out of things or take as much as you can by being as literal as possible (e.g., if you say "Can I have your name?" implying you just want to know what it is, and someone says "Sure, it's So-and-so", you. might literally take their name away from them). In other places, the culture is much more friendly and less mischievous / tricksy. However, this is balanced by reciprocity and hospitality - taking something from someone, or accepting a gift, binds you to them and you must then give them something of approximately equal value in return to maintain the balance.
    
-   Many fey also cannot or will not tell an outright lie, although they will happily lie by omission or implication. Generally speaking, this is the fey of medieval folklore, of the original fairy tales, not so much the Disney-esque modern versions. 

-   Pretty much all of the feywild is part of realms of various Archfey and Fey Lords. Each fey lords domain can be fairly different - some have glittering courts, even cities, while others are extremely wild, and many are in between; some are largely pleasant and friendly, others hostile or malicious. Some are pretty strict about policing their boundaries, others let anyone pass, still others are hidden and cannot be found by ordinary means. The transitions are often not obvious to non-fey (but all fey can easily sense these borders) and catching someone trespassing is an easy way the fey lords use to lure the unknowing or unwitting into deals and bargains.
    
-   The archfey and fey lords that rule the domains of the feywild generally owe their allegiance to either the Seelie Court or the Unseelie Court. While crudely considered "good" and "evil" fey by unknowing [[Humans]], the real differences between them are subtler and more complicated, with the Seelie Court generally associated with protocol and the trappings of civilization, and the Unseelie Court generally associated with indulgence of primal instincts and a much more chaotic vibe. There are also independent archfey that shun the conflict of the Seelie and Unseelie courts and hold themselves neutral.
