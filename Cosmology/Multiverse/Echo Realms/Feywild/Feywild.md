The echo realm of the fey, home to the realms of the Archfey and the [[Fey]]
## Locations

The politics and political organization of the Feywild is based around the realms of the Archfey, such as [[Shimmersong]], [[Amberglow]], [[Fortune's Rest]] or other lesser known realms.

The layout and terrain of the Feywild very loosely matches the layout and terrain of the material plane of Taelgar; so where there are big mountain chains in Taelgar, there are usually mountains of some kind in the Feywild. But this matching is very loose, and often based more on vibes or history than physical geography. 

Roughly, the locations of the following Fey realms are known:
- [[Fortune's Rest]] is superimposed on the area southeast of [[Chardon]], roughly including the southern reaches of [[Elderwood|the Elderwood]], the [[Yeraad]] river valley, and the lowlands leading to the [[Myraeni Gap]]. 
- [[Shimmersong]] is east of [[Fortune's Rest]], covering roughly the [[Myraeni Gap]] and the southern reaches of the CentralMountains, extending into the northern part of the Dunmari plains. 
- [[Amberglow]] stretches east and south from [[Shimmersong]], centered on the [[Kharja]] river valley and extending south into the [[Garamjala Desert]], as well as east towards the Mahar drainage. 
- [[Dreamhaven]] is north of [[Fortune's Rest]], centered around the ancient elven kingdom of [[Ainumarya]] and the northern reaches of the [[Chasa]] river valley.
- [[Whispervale]] is north of [[Dreamhaven]], roughly congruent with the lands now occupied by the northern Deno'qai, along the edge of them mountains.
- [[Splendor's Gleam]] is a small realm, roughly congruent with the northern edge of Lake Valandros and the southern part of the [[Voltara]] plains. 
- [[Wildrun]] is north and west of [[Splendor's Gleam]], roughly congruent with the Tawir Forest and the Mawarkel Peninsula.

%% Notes on how the feywild works: 
    
-   Distances are very different in the Feywild than in Taelgar. Two portals to the Feywild could be 1000 miles apart in Taelgar and only 100 miles apart in the Feywild, or vice versa. 
    
-   Time works strangely in the Feywild. First, there is no night or day; the sun does not move in the sky. However, as you go further west it gets more and more "morning" and as you go further east it gets more and more "evening". So for example, there is a point in the far east where it is constant midnight, and a point in the west where it is always dawn. Second, the Feywild itself is somewhat timeless -- it is hard to track the passage of days without the sun moving, for example. When you travel between the Feywild and another plane, it is never clear how much time will have passed. The same thing is true for journeys in the Feywild itself - moving from one location to another might take a week, but then going back might take only a day.
    
-   The feywild runs on emotion: flowers might wilt if an argument is happening, or bloom if people are laughing nearby 
  

The fey themselves also follow specific rules and customs.

-   The feywild runs on bargains and gifts. The fey don't really use currency, and the place is magical enough that food, water, and shelter are simple to obtain, albeit often with a cost as unknowingly eating the bounty of a fey lord's domain can also bind you to their service. Generally speaking, going back on a deal is a huge crime in all domains across the feywild, and can get you cursed in nasty ways. In some places, the culture is to try to weasel out of things or take as much as you can by being as literal as possible (e.g., if you say "Can I have your name?" implying you just want to know what it is, and someone says "Sure, it's So-and-so", you. might literally take their name away from them). In other places, the culture is much more friendly and less mischievous / tricksy. However, this is balanced by reciprocity and hospitality - taking something from someone, or accepting a gift, binds you to them and you must then give them something of approximately equal value in return to maintain the balance.
    
-   Many fey also cannot or will not tell an outright lie, although they will happily lie by omission or implication. Generally speaking, this is the fey of medieval folklore, of the original fairy tales, not so much the Disney-esque modern versions. 

-   Pretty much all of the feywild is part of realms of various Archfey and Fey Lords. Each fey lords domain can be fairly different - some have glittering courts, even cities, while others are extremely wild, and many are in between; some are largely pleasant and friendly, others hostile or malicious. Some are pretty strict about policing their boundaries, others let anyone pass, still others are hidden and cannot be found by ordinary means. The transitions are often not obvious to non-fey (but all fey can easily sense these borders) and catching someone trespassing is an easy way the fey lords use to lure the unknowing or unwitting into deals and bargains.
    
-   The archfey and fey lords that rule the domains of the feywild generally owe their allegiance to either the Seelie Court or the Unseelie Court. While crudely considered "good" and "evil" fey by unknowing [[Humans]], the real differences between them are subtler and more complicated, with the Seelie Court generally associated with protocol and the trappings of civilization, and the Unseelie Court generally associated with indulgence of primal instincts and a much more chaotic vibe. There are also independent archfey that shun the conflict of the Seelie and Unseelie courts and hold themselves neutral.

### Overview

  

The Feywild is a place of strange magic and deep emotion. Some basic facts of the layout and workings of the plane are detailed here:

  

- The layout and terrain of the Feywild very loosely matches the layout and terrain of the material plane of Taelgar; so where there are big mountain chains in Taelgar, there are usually mountains of some kind in the Feywild. But this matching is very loose, and often based more on vibes or history than physical geography.
    
- Distances are very different in the Feywild than in Taelgar. Two portals to the Feywild could be 1000 miles apart in Taelgar and only 100 miles apart in the Feywild, or vice versa. 
    
- Time works strangely in the Feywild. First, there is no night or day; the sun does not move in the sky. However, as you go further west it gets more and more "morning" and as you go further east it gets more and more "evening". So for example, there is a point in the far east where it is constant midnight, and a point in the west where it is always dawn. Second, the Feywild itself is somewhat timeless -- it is hard to track the passage of days without the sun moving, for example. When you travel between the Feywild and another plane, it is never clear how much time will have passed. The same thing is true for journeys in the Feywild itself - moving from one location to another might take a week, but then going back might take only a day.
    
- The feywild runs on emotion: flowers might wilt if an argument is happening, or bloom if people are laughing nearby
    

  

The people of the Feywild are generally referred to as fae or faerie as a whole, but within that category there are distinctions both obvious and subtle. 

  

- The most common fae are the humanoid, generally human looking people just know as “fae”. The fae are usually elegant and grace humanoids, generally human-like or elf-like in appearance, who could pass for humans in the right circumstances, although usually their eyes and demeanor give them away. In game terms, these fae can use either the Eldarin race, the homebrew Fae race, or the Changeling race (for now). 
    
- The sometimes mischievous, sometimes helpful, and always magical flying fairies are also found in the feywild. These fey are usually small, and include creatures like the pixies, sprites, brownies, and the playable Fairy race. 
    
- The original archfey, at the dawn of the multiverse, were responsible for the awakening of many animals. Some of these now inhabit the Feywild as beastfolk of various kinds. Most famous and most common are the horned satyrs; rarer are the harengons (rabbit-folk) and owlins (owl-folk), and perhaps other creatures. While many of these fey have a fixed animal form, others are more like humans with animal features. In game terms, the playable Satyr, Harengon, Owlin, and Shifter races would be of these beastfolk lineages.
    
- Centaurs were created by the archfey in the early days of the multiverse, just as satyrs and others. However, when the feywild was separately from the material plane, the centaurs stayed, becoming tied to the world of Taelgar itself, seeing themselves as the guardians of Taelgar. In the current day, most centaurs remain in the material plane, traveling and protecting the land of Taelgar itself. However, they are fey creatures, and some do find their way back to the feywild, for various reasons. In game terms, these are represented by the Centaur race. 
    
- Throughout the feywild, there are also innumerable dryads, nymphs, and other spirits of the land. These fey are typically strongly tied to a particular place, rarely traveling. 
    

  

The politics and political organization of the Feywild is based around the realms of the Archfey. 

  

- Pretty much all of the feywild is part of realms of various Archfey and Fey Lords. Each fey lords domain can be fairly different - some have glittering courts, even cities, while others are extremely wild, and many are in between; some are largely pleasant and friendly, others hostile or malicious. Some are pretty strict about policing their boundaries, others let anyone pass, still others are hidden and cannot be found by ordinary means. The transitions are often not obvious to non-fey (but all fey can easily sense these borders) and catching someone trespassing is an easy way the fey lords use to lure the unknowing or unwitting into deals and bargains.
    
- The archfey and fey lords that rule the domains of the feywild generally owe their allegiance to either the Seelie Court or the Unseelie Court. While crudely considered "good" and "evil" fey by unknowing humans, the real differences between them are subtler and more complicated, with the Seelie Court generally associated with protocol and the trappings of civilization, and the Unseelie Court generally associated with indulgence of primal instincts and a much more chaotic vibe. There are also independent archfey that shun the conflict of the Seelie and Unseelie courts and hold themselves neutral. 
    

  

The fey themselves also follow specific rules and customs.

  

- The feywild runs on bargains and gifts. The fey don't really use currency, and the place is magical enough that food, water, and shelter are simple to obtain, albeit often with a cost as unknowingly eating the bounty of a fey lord's domain can also bind you to their service.

### Realms of the Feywild

  

Shimmersong

  

The fey domain of Shimmersong is a land of bright colors and vivid magic. It is hilly terrain, with pillars of bright gems, crystal forests on rolling slopes, glittering caves, spiders that spin webs of diamond. There is the occasional mountain, and the occasional hidden valley of lush plant life in rich, multicolored soil. Mostly it is a riot of color, and full of oddities that mix crystals/gems with living things, so there might be trees on which ruby apples grow, or a crystal tree that produces real citrus, or a deer with antlers of silver instead of bone.

  

Lord Egon, the Lightdancer (they/them pronouns) is a vivacious, almost madcap ruler, obsessed with the vibrancy of their domain. Anything dull, flat, colorless, is considered out of place, and the Lightdancer can transmute life to crystal or crystal to life with their touch, turning lemons into topaz or emeralds into juicy fruits. 

  

But Egon has a dark side, and for some time each year they retreat to hidden caves underground, color fades from the domain, and many of the vibrant plants and animals of the realm turn to stone and metal. There is a stark, winter beauty to this time, but for many in Shimmersong it is hard, and for those who would wish the denizens of the domain ill it is an opportunity. 

  

To keep the domain safe during the dark times, the Lightdancer has company of Winter Knights, a group that rarely emerges during the bright days of light and song, but revels in the harsh beauty when the Lightdancer retreats, and keeps the domain safe from anyone who would take advantage.

  

The people of Shimmersong are grateful to the Winter Knights, but most are eager for the Awakening, the ceremony of springtime that marks the Lightdancer’s return and honors the work of the Winter Knights during the days of grayness and sleep. 

  

Fortune’s Rest

  

The fey domain of Fortune’s Rest is a sparsely inhabited land of pleasant forests and peaceful meadows, seemingly quiet and still, until one finds or is drawn to the Court of the Chanceweaver, Prince of Luck. 

  

The court set on a vast estate of rolling hills, meadows and gardens, all filled to the brim with a riot of games and dazzling color. Dice games of all kinds, card games, even lizard races, anything one can gamble on can be found among the attractions of the Chanceweaver’s Court. Food and music flows freely, and the happy veneer of the elegant fey keeps visitors from seeing the people lurking in the shadows, who have gambled away their names, identities, memories, and even luck itself. 

  

The Chanceweaver’s court is difficult to leave, for each way you turn a new attraction tempts you to return. Those who partake in the food and drink often find they have spent days or weeks in a daze, though the natives of the Feywild are largely resistance to this effect. 

  

Amberglow

  

On the southern and eastern borders of Shimmersong is the fey realm of Amberglow. Once a place of great beauty, a land of constant sunsets and golden skies on wide open plains of amber grasses and lush flowers, it has fallen into decay.

  

The queen of Shimmersong, known as the Cloudspinner, the Queen of Sunsets, vanished, and in her absence the realm decayed. Though some servants and allies of the Cloudspinner’s court remain, most of the realm is a place few dare tread.
