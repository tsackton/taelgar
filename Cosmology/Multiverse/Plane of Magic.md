The Plane of Magic is the name given by arcane cosmologists to the source of the fundamental energetic force that powers all arcane magic in the [[Multiverse]]. Although the Plane of Magic is conventionally depicted as the far nexus of the [[Ethereal Plane]], there is no consensus among scholars regarding the exact nature of this plane, or even its basic properties.
