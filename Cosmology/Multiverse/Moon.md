For the moon -- I started to jot down some ideas w/r/t to the Empty Moon / werewolf arc from Tokra. Here was the intro to Session 39:
 

As you drift to sleep in the comfortable beds at the inn, recovering from a long day of fighting werewolves, the full moon climbs higher in the night sky.  
  
Infused with the light of the Divine Spark, the moon is fully awake now, though hardly aware in any normal sense of the word. And yet as it grows brighter, it can feel the threads of the divine that tie the world below to the spiritual realms, and it pulls, yearning for more, for a deeper connection to the warmth and the glow of divinity. The realms of the gods, as well as the realms of demons and devils and the primordial forces of the world, all draw closer. As the moon reaches for these realms, it creates the planar tides, the ebb and flow of the strength of connection between these realms and the world of Taelgar.  
  

The moon does not remember its past, although it has heard the stories, of course, the conflicting tales and prayers and legends of its origin. Is it a great evil, cast out in the earliest days of creation by Arhat and Malik, cursed to forget in its great tomb, struggling awake for only a few days of each month? Some tales claim so. Or, perhaps, a great hero of the Age of Myth, born and living and dying during the Long Breath before time began, rescued from death by Arhat and Malik, given and honored place in the sky, but unable to be fully restored? Or some say, a hero and villain both, granted the gift of forgetting. The moon hears these tales, and more, washing over them, and yet they find they do not care to know the truth, even in these moments of lucidity.  
  

As you wake in the pre-dawn darkness, the full moon hangs low in the sky. How would you like to start your day?

  
And my notes: idea here is to set up planar tides -- new moon has elemental and fey/echo planes closer, full moon as spiritual realms closer. First children are divided into titans/dragons who are on the spiritual realms and fey/elementals who are on the inner realms -- maybe? Still haven't really resolved dragons and giants, maybe don't need to include that detail for now  
  
Haven't really developed this further but I think there is definitely some potential there. Not sure how well it fits into the Dragonlance Lunar sorcerer though (although I didn't buy the Dragonlance book and I only vaguely remember the UA version).

Addtional notes from Tim:
My only feeling about the moon stuff is that I would like to keep what the moon actually is nebulous, at least for now, following the vibe of the session intro. The moon is some kind of entity in some vague way, but exactly what I think should stay pretty unclear. The planar tide stuff can totally be developed though and is more mechanically relevant to a lunar sorcerer.

Additional notes from Mike:
There are many many stories about the origins and true nature of the moon and you would have little sense of what is or is not true. The bit you would understand a bit better is the nature of planar tides. The moon influences how the planes interact with Taelgar in an important way. When it is full, it pulls on the spiritual realms (the homes of the gods, and places like Arborea, Pandemonium, and the Nine Hells -- the Outer Planes in traditional D&D sense) and draws them closer to Taelgar itself. When it is new, the tides pull the opposite way, so to speak, and it pulls the elemental planes, the Feywild, and the Shadowfell and related planes closer.
