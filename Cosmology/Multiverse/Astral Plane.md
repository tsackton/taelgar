# The Astral Plane

%% copied over a bunch of my secret notes from my secret multiverse doc, so some details do exist. if it becomes necessary / relevant, I think it probably does not give away too much to write this up as a regular page, with publish exclusions for all campaigns.%%

Often described as a vast, empty, silvery sea, marked only by wisps of stray thought, the Astral Plane is the interstitial space in which the spiritual realms exist.
