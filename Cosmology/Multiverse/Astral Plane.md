# The Astral Plane

The Astral Plane is described by those who have traveled there as a vast, empty, silvery sea, marked only by wisps of stray thought, where direction and distance are meaningless, and time does not seem to pass. 

There is much debate about the true nature of the astral plane among scholarly circles. At the [[University of Chardon]], the dominant model holds that the astral plane is an dilute echo which resonants from the [[Plane of Souls]], flowing upward in slow currents towards the [[Plane of Creation]], bisected by the [[Land of the Dead]], which divides the near Astral from the far Astral. Others, especially those who follow the doctrine of [[Planar Dualism|planar dualism]], claim the Astral Plane is the fundamental plane of [[Soulstuff]], and consider the [[Plane of Souls]], the [[Land of the Dead]], and the [[Plane of Creation]] to be simply regions of the Astral Plane, where the density of [[Soulstuff]] is higher than normal. The followers of the radical [[stoneborn]] metaphysicist [[Yendalo]] even claim that the Astral Plane does not exist: what others call the near Astral is merely an extension of the [[Plane of Souls]], and what others call the far Astral is merely an extension of the [[Plane of Creation]]. 

Whatever the true nature of the Astral Plane, all scholars agree that the [[Spiritual Realms]] are embedded within the Astral Plane, but only in the portion of Astral that is beyond the [[Land of the Dead]]; and that one can, using powerful magic, project ones' consciousness from the [[Plane of Souls]] to the Astral Plane, leaving the body behind.

Key features of the Astral Plane:
- The Astral Plane cannot be reached directly from the Material Plane; there are no natural portals that connect from the Material to the Astral. 
- Spells, such as Astral Projection, Plane Shift, or Gate, can allow transportation to any part of the Astral Plane, whether on the Material Plane side of the [[Land of the Dead]] or the Plane of Creation side of the [[Land of the Dead]]
- It is not clear if the [[Land of the Dead]] can be crossed while on the Astral Plane. Potentially, this is impossible; perhaps the [[Land of the Dead]] forms a chasm or a wall that divides the near and far Astral. 
- There are, plausibly, many strange things floating in the astral plane, including lost, dead gods.
