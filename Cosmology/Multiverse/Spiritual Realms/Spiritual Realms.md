# Spiritual Realms

%% OPEN QUESTIONS %%

In the standard multiversal model, the Spiritual Realms are those planes that exist beyond the [[Land of the Dead]], within the matrix of the [[Astral Plane]]. Most theological cosmologists postulate that the Spiritual Realms, unlike other planes, are spun out of [[Soulstuff]] itself; these realms are widely acknowledged as the homes of the gods and the final resting place of the souls of sentient beings.

The details of the Spiritual Realms are hard to flesh out without a better sense of the kinds of Spiritual Realms, and how they are understood in-world. Minimally, there needs to be three distinct varieties of Spiritual Realms:
- The homes of the Embodied Gods, of which the [[Heart of the Mountain]] is the only one with any lore development. So far, the default assumption is that each embodied pantheon has one plane, but this need not be definitive. 
- The homes of the Incorporeal Gods; none are particularly well developed, except [[Shakun's Realm]] which is potentially a special case. I suspect the model of one plane per pantheon, in general, is probably right, although e.g. the Dunmari Five Siblings must have at least two (Shakun's Realm and [[Arkaash]], the latter of which so far exists only as a name)
- The various "traditional Outer Planes" that exist in Taelgar: [[Arborea]], [[Pandemonium]], [[Limbo]], the [[Abyss]], and the [[Nine Hells]] at least definitively exist, and I think at least something like a Plane of Order (Mechanus) and a Prison Plane (Caceri) probably exist. But otherwise little is canon here. 

My sense is that it is easiest to travel to the "traditional Outer Planes", then the homes of the Embodied Gods, and last/most difficult the homes of the Incorporeal Gods (which might not really have a real physical existence in most cases, and might function more like simply the body of the Divine or something). 

Also, it is not clear how people who follow Mos Numena, for example, interpret the Dunmari planes. Do they consider these just other gods they don't worship? Do they think of them as just different names for parts of the same gods (a la the high school conception of Aspects of Eru/Melkor)? How would, e.g., a Mos Numena theologian depict Arkaash?

One idea:
In standard [[Mos Numena]] theology, the Spiritual Realms are depicted in a tripartite arrangement: the Mos Numena Divine Realm in the center, often shown as a wide disc fed by the upwelling of the [[Land of the Dead|River of Souls]]; the realms of the [[Embodied Gods]] as spheres surrounding the central disc; and the primal realms, the
