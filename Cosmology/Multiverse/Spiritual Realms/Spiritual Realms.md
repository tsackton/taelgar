# Spiritual Realms

In the standard multiversal model, the Spiritual Realms are those planes that exist beyond the [[Land of the Dead]], within the matrix of the [[Astral Plane]]. Most theological cosmologists postulate that the Spiritual Realms, unlike other planes, are spun out of [[Soulstuff]] itself; these realms are widely acknowledged as the homes of the gods and the final resting place of the souls of sentient beings.
