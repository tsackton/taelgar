# The Land of the Dead
>[!info]+ Information
> A plane in the [[Spiritual Realms]]

The vast gathering place for the souls of the dead. When a consciousness, or soul, dies, it fades from the [[Plane of Souls]], but does not immediately disappear into nothingness. Most (although not all) instead drift towards the Land of the Dead, which has many names and many descriptions in different cultures, human and non-human alike. Here, the souls of the dead drift, waiting. Some, those who are not claimed by any god or being of similar power, eventually fade away into nothingness, becoming part of the essence of the place itself. Others are taken up into spiritual realms.
