The Abyss 

%% Clearly exists but needs some work to define based on the conception of how the outer planes work %%


%% Tharandros, the leader of this band of centaurs, tells the party that they are moving west, leaving their lands east of here. He tells of disease and poison flowing from a rope that binds the land to another plane, of poisoned water flowing from Ravenâ€™s Hold and contaminating more and more land, of demons that sicken the earth. He tells of how all the infinite imaginings of people exist somewhere in the infinity of the Divine void, and how long ago, in ages long past, humans who preached hellfire and damnation created the Abyss, a realm of chaos and torment and violence, and now the nightmares of people sustain it and places like it.  %%
