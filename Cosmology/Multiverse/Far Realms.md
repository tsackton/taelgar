# Far Realms

%% mike - any additions/changes? %%

It is well-known that some ancient horrors, most notably [[Ithilids|Mind Flayers]], are native to dark, alien places, and some eldritch secrets are said to come from ancient gods who slumber outside the reach of the [[Divine Presence]]. Arcane cosmologists have proposed that the native realms of creatures such as these must be  beyond the [[Multiverse]], and have given the name the Far Realms to these strange, alien places.  

Few scholars study such places: the most famous work on the subject, the [[Zharuk Akhal|Zhâruk Akhâl]], is said to drive those who dare read its secrets mad. However, most arcane cosmologists believe there are many distinct Far Realms. The ancient dwarven scholar [[Thardrum Deepseeker]] even claimed that not all of the Far Realms need be home to dangerous and evil creatures. However, legend says that Thardrum vanished far beneath the [[Sentinel Range|Sentinels]], his fate unknown, and few these days give credence to his beliefs.

Many relevant brainstorming notes:
- [[Discord Chat - Deep History]]
- [[Discord Chat - Multiverse]]
- [[Discord Chat - Souls]]
- [[Far Realms Brainstorming]]

Note that creatures native the Far Realms should not have traditional Taelgarian souls, barring some kind of weird special exception. Which might mean they cannot be targeted by Astral Projection or any resurrection magic, for example; other metaphysical or mechanical consequences are unclear. 

The secret does not have any relevance to mind flayers or related aberrations.
