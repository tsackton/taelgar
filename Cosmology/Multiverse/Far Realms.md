# Far Realms

%% I made some small edits to make Thardrum's philosophy just a little less discredited - I don't want Viepuck's patron to see completely fringe. But not sure if there is too much detail for this page? %%

It is well-known that some ancient horrors, most notably [[Ithilids|Mind Flayers]], are native to dark, alien places, and some eldritch secrets are said to come from ancient gods who slumber outside the reach of the [[Divine Presence]]. Arcane cosmologists have proposed that the native realms of creatures such as these must be beyond the [[Multiverse]], and have given the name the Far Realms to these strange, alien places.  

Few scholars study such places: the most famous work on the subject, the [[Zharuk Akhal|Zhâruk Akhâl]], is said to drive those who dare read its secrets mad. However, most arcane cosmologists believe there are many distinct Far Realms. The ancient dwarven scholar [[Thardrum Deepseeker]] even claimed that not all of the Far Realms need be home to dangerous and evil creatures. History does not record Thardum's fate, but his work was rediscovered in [[Isingue]] before the [[Great War]]. Although largely dismissed by the [[Faculty of Metaphysics]], [[Nicole Ardouin]] of the [[University of Tollen]] maintained that "good" and "evil" are not the right metrics to judge such alien realms. In her seminal work, [[The Exposition of the Alien Mind]], she argues that some of the Far Realms are home to beings who -- if only they could be communicated with -- could bring much new knowledge to the world.

The fact that she never returned from a research expedition to the [[Marches of Enford]] has kept her work marginal.

The patron of [[Viepuck]] is canonically a Far Realm creature motivated by curiosity about Taelgar and a desire to understand life in the Multiverse, but with some of the vibe of an entomologist studying bees, rather than as human anthropologist. This patron discovered Viepuck during a ritual sacrifice, although the exact metaphysics are not clear. 

Many relevant brainstorming notes:
- [[Discord Chat - Deep History]]
- [[Discord Chat - Multiverse]]
- [[Discord Chat - Souls]]
- [[Far Realms Brainstorming]]

Note that creatures native the Far Realms should not have traditional Taelgarian souls, barring some kind of weird special exception. Which might mean they cannot be targeted by Astral Projection or any resurrection magic, for example; other metaphysical or mechanical consequences are unclear. 

The secret does not have any relevance to mind flayers or related aberrations.
