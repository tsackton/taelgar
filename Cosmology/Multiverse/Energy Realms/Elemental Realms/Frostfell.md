Frostfell, the Elemental Plane of Ice, is located in the transition zone between the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] and the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. It is a land of bitter cold, with vast ice fields dotted with freezing pools of liquid colder than ice, inhabited by any manner of creatures of ice and snow, including snow trolls, frost giants, and massive ice constructs. Closer to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], Frostfell becomes a land of icebergs and glaciers on the edge of an ocean of deadly cold and endless storms.
