# The Elemental Plane of Fire

The Elemental Plane of Fire is described in one of the few surviving fragments of the *[[Compendium of Fire]]* as a realm of unrelenting heat and ceaseless flame. It is a place where the ground itself blazes with molten rock, rivers of lava carve paths through burning wastelands, and the air shimmers with an oppressive heat that few can endure. The sky above is alight with a permanent glow, that grows to a white hot furnace during the day, and dims to a red fiery twilight at night. Travelers who enter this plane unprepared for the supernatural heat of this real are doomed to perish, their bodies scorched beyond recognition. 

The Plane of Fire is acknowledged by [[Airion]] as the most dangerous of the Elemental Realms, the hardest to study, for only those with magical resistance to the oppressive heat of the plane can survive there. The most reliable scholarly studies of the Plane of Fire were conducted by the Drankorian society [[Concordia Pyrae]], an order of planar scholars and pyromancers dedicated to uncovering the secret essence of fire itself. Their _[[Compendium of Fire]]_, a ten-volume encyclopedia on the plane, was tragically lost during the [[Fall of Drankor]], leaving significant gaps in our modern understanding of this realm.

### Portals to the Plane of Fire

Portals to the Plane of Fire are rare and treacherous, often appearing in the hearts of volcanic eruptions or within the core of intense magical forges. Concordia Pyrae records indicate that these portals manifest as searing columns of flame that twist and writhe, burning away anything in their path. Unlike the Elemental Plane of Air, where portals are fleeting, those to the Plane of Fire are often long-lasting but nearly impossible to approach due to the extreme temperatures and hazards surrounding them.

### Traveling on the Plane of Fire

Few firsthand accounts of travel on the Plane of Fire exist due to its inhospitable nature. What little is known comes from fragmented records preserved in surviving _Occulta Ludum_ studies, as well as ancient Drankorian writings. These describe a realm where survival is possible only through powerful magical wards or innate resistance to fire. Even then, travelers face an unending onslaught of heat, flames, and molten terrain. The very ground burns underfoot, and pools of lava bubble ominously, erupting unpredictably.

Reports suggest that movement in this realm is further hindered by constant waves of heat that distort vision and obscure landmarks, making navigation treacherous. Without detailed maps or magical guidance, many explorers become hopelessly lost, wandering until the flames consume them.

### Inhabitants of the Plane of Fire

_See more: [[Elementals]]_

The **Efreeti**, proud and imperious genies of flame, dominate the Plane of Fire. Towering figures with skin like molten brass and eyes that burn with inner fire, the efreeti are renowned not only for their arrogance but also for their remarkable craftsmanship and vast collections of treasures. Unlike their djinni cousins, who embrace whimsy and freedom, the efreeti are exacting and meticulous. They are known to enslave talented artisans, using them to create items of exquisite beauty, from enchanted weapons to elaborate works of art, which the efreeti prize above all else.

Despite their harsh reputation, efreeti are not wasteful. Even the most prideful among them will value a skilled tool or creation, treating it with an almost reverent care. This utilitarian ethos extends to their vast cities of flame and brass, where they forge and shape their dominion.

Other denizens of the plane include elemental creatures of fire and magma, such as salamanders and azers. These beings often serve the efreeti as laborers and soldiers, though they sometimes carve out their own existence in the molten wastes. Myths speak of **elder flames**, ancient and sentient infernos that drift aimlessly through the plane, consuming anything in their path. Whether these legends have any basis in fact is unknown, as no scholar has ever survived an encounter with such a creature to tell the tale.

### Landmarks on the Plane of Fire

Due to the harsh conditions, reliable maps of the Plane of Fire do not exist, and much of its geography remains unknown. However, a few recurring landmarks appear in fragmented records:

- **The City of Brass**: The sprawling capital of the efreeti, built atop a lake of molten metal and wreathed in eternal flames. Its towering spires of polished brass gleam with a fiery brilliance, and it is said to be the greatest city in all the Energy Realms.
- **The Obsidian Steps**: A series of black volcanic ledges leading down into a bottomless pit of fire. The steps are said to be a place of judgment for the efreeti, where captured enemies are cast into the flames below.
- **The Molten Veil**: A shimmering curtain of lava that flows perpetually across a vast canyon. Legends claim that passing through the Veil grants visions of the planeâ€™s origin, though none have survived to confirm this.
- **The Forge Eternal**: A colossal, self-sustaining forge, said to be the birthplace of legendary weapons and artifacts wielded by the greatest of the efreeti. Its fires never dim, and its secrets remain closely guarded.
- **The Burning Straits**: A narrow pathway flanked by rivers of fire, where ancient ruins rise from the flames. Some believe these ruins predate even the efreeti, remnants of an older civilization consumed by the flames.
