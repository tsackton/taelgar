# The Energy Realms

In the [[Standard Multiversal Model]], made famous by the [[Faculty of Metaphysics]] at the [[University of Chardon]], the Energy Realms are the name for the collection of planes associated with the fundamental energies of the multiverse. The traditional model, popularized by [[Julius Ceptuso]], postulates five fundamental energies of matter, Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Magic, each associated with an Energy Realm. Although modern metaphysical cosmologists typically consider Magic to be a fundamental multiversal force and do not include the Plane of Magic within the Energy Realms, the five fundamental energies retain a hold on the population conception. 

This traditional model postulates there are only four (or five, if the Plane of Magic is included) Energy Realms. The strongest argument for this claim comes from the seminal work of the cosmological philosopher [[~Drankorian Scholar 1~]], [[~On Elemental Myths~]], who exhaustively catalogs folklore, myth, and observation considering the nature of elemental beings, with a focus on the sentient and powerful genies. She conclusively shows that the vast majority of creatures with a "pure elemental essence" are associated Fire, Water, Earth, or Air. 

## Alternate Conceptions

### Airion's Compound Elemental Planes

The recent rediscovery of the [[~Airion Elemental Tome~]] by the famous wizard and elementalist [[Airion|Airion the Mistspeaker]] calls into question the traditional model, however. Airion devoted his life to the study of the elemental planes, until he was tragically killed in his prime during the [[Great War]]. Much of his work was lost during the [[Blood Years]], but recent efforts by the [[Great Library]] to recover lost knowledge have paid dividends. In [[~Airion Elemental Tome~]], [[Airion]] claims, by careful experimentation with planar travel, to have isolated specific metaphysical energies associated with a number of Compound Elemental Realms, which  have traditionally been considered localized regions of the vast Elemental Realms. Airion speaks of at least eight of these Compound Elemental Planes that represent what he calls the secondary energies, to distinguish them from the five fundamental energies.

He describes: [[Frostfell]], representing the energy of cold, a blend of Water and Air; [[~Plane of Magma~]], representing the energy of ~magma~, a blend of Fire and Earth; [[~Plane of Ooze~]], representing the energy of ~ooze~, a blend of Water and Earth; [[~Plane of Ash and Smoke~]], representing the energy of ~smoke~, a blend of Fire and Air; (other planes for Magic/Water, Magic/Fire, Magic/Air, Magic/Earth).

### The Seven Fundamental Energies of the Dwarves

Dwarven metaphysicists traditionally postulate a model of the Energy Realms based on the ancient theory, supposedly spoken to the first dwarves by the [[Bahrazel|Firstborn]] themselves, of the seven fundamental energies of the [[Material Plane]]: Spirit (associated with the Ruler), Magic (associated with the Runecrafter), Earth (associated with the Priest), Air (associated with the Traveler), Fire (associated with the Stoneworker), Water (associated with the Farmer), Metal (associated with the Warrior). In this model, the essence of Spirit is associated with the [[Heart of the Mountain]], while the other six energies associated with specific Energy Realms, implying the existence of an [[Elemental Plane of Metal]]. While [[~Drankorian Scholar 1~]] dismisses this, citing a lack of evidence of pure metal elementals, empirical metaphysicists have documented descriptions of places -- assumed to be part of the Elemental Plane of Earth -- that resemble massive twisted caverns of iron, which some theorists believe could instead be the mysterious [[Elemental Plane of Metal]].

something about how life and death may be considered fundamental forces as well, leading to the Positive and Negative Energy planes
maybe elven? maybe another human culture that hasn't come up much yet, perhaps a northern culture?
