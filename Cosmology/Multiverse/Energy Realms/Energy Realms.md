# The Energy Realms
>[!info]+ Information  
>> `$=dv.view("_scripts/view/get_Whereabouts")`

The Energy Realms are the collective name for the [[Inner Realms]] that are associated with the raw magical energy separated from the [[Material Plane]] during the [[Riving]]. The Energy Realms are embedded in the material of the [[Ethereal Plane]], which indirectly links them to the [[Material Plane]]. The most well known -- and possibly only -- of the Energy Realms are the [[Elemental Realms]].
