# The Elemental Plane of Earth

The Elemental Plane of Earth, as described in the revered dwarven saga _[[The Song of the Eternal Earth]]_, is a realm of solid stone, where the walls of endless caverns press in, and the weight of rock dampens even the loudest echos. It is a land of endless stone, soil, and crystal formations in every imaginable hue, where labyrinthine tunnels twist and turn, glowing faintly with veins of precious minerals, leading to vast subterranean chambers. Although _The Song of Eternal Earth_ speaks of a "sunless sky", few scholars believe there is, in fact, a surface above the endless caverns of the Plane of Earth.

## Portals to the Plane of Earth

The great geomancer [[Khevaris Stoneweaver]] studied planar access to the Elemental Plane of Earth extensively. According to his writings, the most direct way to reach this realm is through the [[Ethereal Plane]], where passages to the Plane of Earth appear as gray curtains that look like shimmering stone.

Less predictable but more common are the elemental vortexes, which occur deep underground, and in areas of extreme seismic activity. Khevaris recorded accounts of miners uncovering strange rifts that led directly into this vast plane, often at great peril to themselves. Unlike the Plane of Air, where portals flicker and shift, the Plane of Earth is said to hold its connections more firmly, though they may be hidden deep beneath the surface of the [[Material Plane]]. Many dwarves believe that the deepest caverns below the mountains blend seamlessly with the Elemental Plane of Earth, those who explore deep beneath the earth, never to return, may have wandered across a planar boundary and become lost.
## Traveling on the Plane of Earth

Traveling within the Elemental Plane of Earth is as challenging as it is fascinating. While those with the ability to move through stone can navigate it with relative ease, most travelers must contend with narrow tunnels, immense caverns, and sudden shifts in the ground. 

The plane is not static; tremors and quakes constantly reshape its passages, sometimes creating spectacular new vistas and other times collapsing entire routes. These seismic shifts can reveal buried treasures, such as veins of adamantine or chambers of glimmering quartz, but they can also trap the unwary in eternal darkness. The weight of the plane itself is oppressive, and even the hardiest adventurers speak of feeling the immense pressure of stone bearing down on their spirits.

## Inhabitants of the Plane of Earth

_See more: [[Elementals]]_

The [[Elementals|Dao]], proud and greedy genies of the Plane of Earth, are its most famous inhabitants. With skin like polished stone and eyes that glimmer like gems, the dao are known for their unmatched skill in mining and crafting. They rule over vast underground palaces adorned with glittering treasures, treating their elemental servants and captives as little more than tools for their ambitions.

Other creatures of stone and earth also populate the plane. Elementals formed of raw rock and soil roam its depths, from towering, lumbering beings of granite to smaller, sharper constructs of flint and obsidian. Unconfirmed rumors speak of massive creatures of stone and earth, as big as a mountain, that roam the surface above the caverns of the Plane of Earth, but, as there is no evidence that the Plane of Earth has a surface, [[Lyrannis of Aquilona]] is more than happy to dismiss these claims as mere flights of fancy in her seminal work, [[On Elemental Forms]].

## Landmarks on the Plane of Earth

The Elemental Plane of Earth is an endless labyrinth, and mapping it is an impossible task. Nonetheless, explorers and geomancers have recorded a number of significant landmarks:

- **The Adamant Vault**: A colossal cavern encased in unbreakable adamantine, said to be the heart of dao craftsmanship. Legend holds that the dao kings forged their greatest treasures here, and it is guarded by their fiercest warriors.
    
- **The Emerald Chasm**: A vast abyss lined with massive emerald crystals, some as large as towers, which glow faintly with an eerie green light. The chasm is said to be sacred to certain tribes of earth elementals.
    
- **The Stoneheart Labyrinth**: A network of tunnels that spans thousands of miles, carved by an ancient, unknown force. The walls of the labyrinth are adorned with glyphs that no scholar has yet deciphered.
    
- **The Obsidian Pillar**: A single towering spire of black volcanic glass, rising miles into the plane’s ceilingless heights. Some believe it is a remnant of the plane’s creation, containing the raw essence of earth.
    
- **The Rivers of Gold**: Streams of molten metal that flow through deep subterranean channels, illuminating the darkness with their fiery glow. They are a place of great beauty but deadly heat, and they are jealously guarded by the dao.
    
- **The Crystal Grotto of Kalarith**: A cavern filled with massive quartz and amethyst formations that hum with latent energy. It is said that meditating here grants visions of the plane’s ancient past.
