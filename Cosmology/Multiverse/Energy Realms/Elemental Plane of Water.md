# The Elemental Plane of Water

The Elemental Plane of Water is one of the [[Inner Realms]], separated from the [[Material Plane]] during the [[Riving]]. It is a realm of endless ocean, where floating rocks provide the only surface, and those who cannot breath water quickly die. 

It is rumored that in certain deep places in the ocean on the [[Material Plane]], one can find portals to the endless deeps of the Plane of Water.

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
A known portal to the Elemental Plane of Water was located in the merfolk city of [[Omi]], but was presumed to have collapsed after the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] recovered the [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]] from the [[Merfolk]] warlock [[Buruli]].
