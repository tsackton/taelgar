In the classical texts of [[Mos Numena ]]theology that have come down from the days before the [[The Downfall|Downfall]], the Plane of Souls is described as a realm of pure thought, where the sparks of the souls of all sentient beings native to the [[Material Plane]] float like constellations. These ancient texts say the Plane of Souls is the connection between the material and the divine, and that each soul that floats in the constellations on the Plane of Souls is a locus for divine miracles. Without the Plane of Souls, in Mos Numenan tradition, we would be mindless constructs. 

While most scholars accept a version of this depiction, and the theology of the Plane of Souls as the intersection between the material and the divine is common across diverse religious traditions, the [[fey]] tell a different tale. According to the theologian [[Camilla of Drankor]], the most prominent ancient scholar of fey cosmology, the fey believe the Plane of Souls is but a pale, distant echo of the vibrant chaos of the [[Dreamworld]]. These heretical opinions are not widely accepted by any theological cosmologists, excepting the followers of [[Yendalism]], who persist in claiming that the souls of all denizens of what they call the [[Inner Realms]] are reflected in the constellations of the [[Plane of Souls]].

The plane of souls has three relevant impacts worth keeping in mind:
- To the extent that psionic mechanics exist, they would typically be powered by a particularly strong connection to the plane of souls. Similar with things like monk focus, or other kinds of "inner strength". While there are not really any direct mechanical consequences of this, for flavor reasons it is worth keeping in mind that these magics are quite distinct from arcane magic or divine miracles. 
- The Dreamworld is an echo realm (in some sense - maybe the fey are right?) of the Plane of Souls, and so the most common way to reach the Dreamworld would typically be through the Plane of Souls. This is mostly a color things, but e.g. traveling to the Dreamworld from the Material Plane at least should usually pass through the constellation of souls, narratively.
- The Plane of Souls either connects to, or is part of, the Astral Plane. Astral Projection would normally start from your spark on the Plane of Souls, for example. 

Beyond this, in-world or meta details are a bit vague.
