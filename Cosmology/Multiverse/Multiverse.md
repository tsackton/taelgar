%% a page for overall cosmology %%

%%SECERT

basic structure of cosmology:

material plane in the middle, with echo realms spinning out from it 
ethereal plane connects to elemental planes and plane of magic

plane of souls is kind of like an echo realm, but for sentient thought; dreamworld and nightmare realm and other similar places are kind of like echos of the plane of souls

land of dead / river of souls is a sharp dividing line - beyond is the deep astral (equivalent to regular D&D astral plane) and the spirit realms of the gods

%% NOTES

During the [[The Riving|Riving]], a moment out time both instantaneous and eternal, the [[Divine Presence]] spun something new out of itself, ~soulstuff~, a force of creation wholly distinct from the chaotic energy of magic. From this ~soulstuff~, the [[Divine Presence]] created the [[Embodied Gods]], giving to them the gift of channeling the creative force of ~soulstuff~. Yet, at the same time, the [[Void Mind]] was able to steal a sliver of divinity from the [[Divine Presence]], and carefully sheltered, breathed life-of-sorts into the [[Three Despairs]]. To control and limit the chaos that unfettered creation could produce, the [[Divine Presence]] created a barrier, which later came to be known as the [[Land of the Dead]], through which the magic of creation could not pass, preventing those on the [[Material Plane]] from impacting the multiverse. 

~soulstuff~ in this narrative is the material of the Astral Plane, which forms a gradient from the ~Deep Astral~ which is kind of pure divine creation energy to the "normal" Astral Plane where the "Outer Planes" float, to the Land of the Dead which forms a barrier that prevents the material plane / plane of souls  from impacting the metaverse. The Plane of Souls is the manifestation of the ~soulstuff~ / Astral Plane in proximity to the Material Plane, and the Dreamworld is an echo realm of the plane of souls in a way.


The [[The Riving|Riving]] ended, and time began, with the creation of something new: sentient creatures, endowed with the soul stuff by their divine creators. These were the [[Children of the Embodied Gods]], and from the act of their creation sprung the [[Plane of Souls]]. 

left unresolved in this narrative is the exact relationship between the elder folk, plane of souls, land of the dead, embodied gods, and ~soulstuff~. The key detail is that at the end of the Riving, the Embodied Gods exist, ~soulstuff~ / Astral Plane / Plane of Souls exist, the elder folk are created, but there is a barrier, a wall that prevents "unfettered creation".

At the start of the Age, [[The Riving]], resulted in:
* The creation of the [[Echo Realms]] and the [[Energy Realms]] and the departure of many of the powerful [[Great Wyrms]], [[Archfey]], [[Titans]], and the elemental powers to other planes
%% the metaphysics needs a little more thought - Echo Realms and Energy Realms are clear enough but it isn't obvious that titans who flee, or great wyrms, make sense to end up in one of those places. %%
* The creation of the [[Embodied Gods]] and their creations, the [[Elder Folk]]
* The creation of the [[Three Despairs]], and in turn, their creations: [[Thark]], the [[Goddess of the End]], the [[Endless Chaos]],  the [[Mad One]] 
   %% note: see below about orcs; possible to move Thark's creation if it should align with creation of orcs %%
* The unleashing of the curses of necromancy and lycanthropy on the world
