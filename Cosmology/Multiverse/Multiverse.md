# Multiverse

%% added some classification tweaks and a bit more in-world scholarly color. tagging for feedback or just remove check if you see nothing to add/change %%

A variety of planes surround and extend from the [[Material Plane]], together making up the Multiverse. 

While there are many ways to describe the multiverse, the most widely known comes from elven scholars, who describe the multiverse a pair of intersecting domes balanced between two opposite poles: below, the dome of the physical planes rising from the roiling chaos of the [[Plane of Magic]]; above, the dome of the planes of sentience, descending from the blinding intensity of the [[Plane of Creation]].  

The duality of the [[Material Plane]] -- the physical structures of the universe -- and the [[Plane of Souls]] -- the soul structures of the sentient inhabitants of the universe -- sit in the middle of these domes, the Material Plane anchored to the dome of physicality, the Plane of Souls anchored to the dome of sentience. 

Descending "below" the material plane in this cosmology is the [[Ethereal Plane]], which stretches from the border ethereal, co-localizing with the material plane, through the interior ethereal, a foggy expanse of swirling mists, to the deep ethereal, which bleeds into the [[Plane of Magic]]. Embedded within the "sea" of the [[Ethereal Plane]] are the [[Energy Realms]], chief among them the [[Elemental Realms]], domains of pure physicality, capturing the essence of the fundamental elements of the universe. 

Floating "above" the plane of souls in this cosmology is the [[Astral Plane]], which is bisected by the [[Land of the Dead]], a collecting point for souls and an not-quite-impermeable barrier separating the raw energy of creation from the [[Material Plane]]. Beyond the [[Land of the Dead]], the [[Astral Plane]] is a strange empty expanse of silvery waves, in which the [[Spiritual Realms]] float like bubbles, until it merges with the blinding energy of the [[Plane of Creation]]. 

Layered on top of this cosmology, the elven scholars speak of the [[Echo Realms]], the distortions and reflections and reverberations of the planes created by the [[Riving]], which still resonance today. Most notably, these include the [[Feywild]], an echo of the material plane, and the [[Dreamworld]], an echo of the plane of souls, but others have been described, including the domains of the [[Shadowfolds]], the [[Nightmare Realm]], and the [[Mirror Realm]]. 

>[!faq] The Classification of Planes
>There are, of course, many typologies of planes that are possible, and arcane cosmologists argue at length about the fundamental nature of the cosmos. However, among the [[Faculty of Metaphysics]] at the [[University of Chardon]], the following scheme currently enjoys the most scholarly support:
>
> **Fundamental Planes**: There are six planes that are considered to be the fundamental units of all creation: the [[Plane of Creation]] and its dilute echo the [[Astral Plane]]; the [[Plane of Magic]] and its dilute echo the [[Ethereal Plane]]; and the duality of the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Plane of Souls]]. These six planes are unique and unlike any other planes, although some scholars consider the Material Plane and the Plane of Souls to be one entity, metaphysically, and others consider the Plane of Creation and the Plane of Magic to be just particularly dense regions of the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane, respectively. 
> 
> **Energy Realms**: The [[Energy Realms]] are considered to be all the planes that exist within the confines of the [[Ethereal Plane]]. Chief among these are the [[Elemental Realms]]. Some scholars believe that other energy realms exist to be discovered, such as the hypothesized Positive Energy Plane and Negative Energy Plane, but others believe the Elemental Realms are the only Energy Realms. 
> 
> **Spiritual Realms:** The [[Spiritual Realms]] are the planes of the divine, the planes of gods and demons and other spiritual beings, which some speculate are made of the pure material of creation, which they call [[~soulstuff~]]. While most scholars consider the [[Land of the Dead]] to be a part of the [[Spiritual Realms]], others argue it should be considered a region of the [[Astral Plane]], or even its own Fundamental Plane. 
> 
> **Echo Realms**: The [[Echo Realms]], in the opinion of the metaphysical scholars of [[University of Chardon|Chardon]], are not really true planes at all. They are merely echoes of the particular moment when the Material Plane, the Plane of Souls, and the energy realms were separated into different planes during the [[Riving]]. This, it is said, is why they are rarely continuous and complete, like the [[Energy Realms]], but rather often exist as discrete domains. Some [[Ulfgar Frostbeard|scholars]] even go so far as to consider the [[Feywild]] as a the third part of a trinity that includes material, soul, and magic, and do not consider it to even belong among the Echo Realms, but this is a distinctly minority opinion.

## The Creation of the Multiverse

When the [[Divine Presence]] awoke or came into being and made existence, the multiverse was unformed, a chaotic sea of the unfettered power of the Plane of Magic, in which those with the will to use it could reshape the world with a thought. During the [[Riving]], the [[Divine Presence]] ripped the fabric of reality apart, isolating raw magical power to the planes, limiting and constraining magic and creation on the [[Material Plane]] itself. 

From the [[Riving]], the [[Energy Realms]] were created, and the [[Ethereal Plane]] stretched to pull the [[Plane of Magic]] from the [[Material Plane]]. To limit the power of unfettered creation in the [[Material Plane]], the [[Land of the Dead]] was created, as a barrier to separate the [[Plane of Souls]] and the [[Material Plane]] from the [[Plane of Creation]] and the raw energy of divinity. 

The [[Riving]], however, unleashed untold energy that not even the [[Divine Presence]] could control. The echos of this energy still resonant among the planes "beneath" the barrier of the [[Land of the Dead]], fueling the [[Echo Realms]]. 

Isolated from the [[Material Plane]] by the [[Land of the Dead]], the [[Spiritual Realms]] were spun out of [[~soulstuff~]] and the [[Plane of Creation]] by the [[Embodied Gods]], and later by the [[Incorporeal Gods]] and even the primal beliefs of humanity. 

From this, then the following chronology emerges:
- The Material Plane, the Plane of Creation, the Plane of Magic, and the transitive planes that connect them (the Astral and Ethereal planes, respectively) predate the Riving and have presumably existed since the beginning of the multiverse in some fashion or another, although the Astral Plane and Ethereal Plane have been reshaped and stretched. 
- The Energy Realms, the Plane of Souls, the Land of the Dead, and the Echo Realms arise out of the Riving. They don't exist, at least not in recognizable form, prior to the Riving, and emerge in ways that can be linked to their current incarnations after the Riving. While most, or perhaps all, of these Planes are formed at once, the Echo Realms may have additional complexities and perhaps sometimes collapse, merge, grow, and split in unpredictable ways. 
- The Spiritual Realms emerge in fits and starts and without any consistent chronology, but dating to during or after the Riving, each with its own creation story and myth.
