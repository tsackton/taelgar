%% a page for overall cosmology %%

%%SECERT

basic structure of cosmology:

material plane in the middle, with echo realms spinning out from it 
ethereal plane connects to elemental planes and plane of magic

plane of souls is kind of like an echo realm, but for sentient thought; dreamworld and nightmare realm and other similar places are kind of like echos of the plane of souls

land of dead / river of souls is a sharp dividing line - beyond is the deep astral (equivalent to regular D&D astral plane) and the spirit realms of the gods
