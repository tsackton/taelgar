A variety of planes surround and extend from the [[Material Plane]], together making up the Multiverse. 

While there are many ways to describe the multiverse, the most widely known comes from elven scholars, who describe the multiverse a pair of intersecting domes: the below, the dome of the physical planes rising from the roiling chaos of the [[Plane of Magic]]; above, the dome of the planes of sentience, descending from the blinding intensity of the [[Plane of Creation]].  

The duality of the [[Material Plane]] -- the physical structures of the universe -- and the [[Plane of Souls]] -- the soul structures of the sentient inhabitants of the universe -- sit in the middle of these domes, the Material Plane anchored to the dome of physicality, the Plane of Souls anchored to the dome of sentience. 

Descending "below" the material plane in this cosmology is the [[Ethereal Plane]], which stretches from the border ethereal, co-localizing with the material plane, through the interior ethereal, a foggy expanse of swirling mists, to the deep ethereal, which bleeds into the [[Plane of Magic]]. Embedded within the "sea" of the [[Ethereal Plane]] are the [[Energy Realms]], chief among them the [[Elemental Planes]], domains of pure physicality, capturing the essence of the fundamental elements of the universe. 

Floating "above" the plane of souls in this cosmology is the [[Astral Plane]], which is bisected by the [[Land of the Dead]], a collecting point for souls and an not-quite-impermeable barrier separating the raw energy of creation from the [[Material Plane]]. Beyond the [[Land of the Dead]], the [[Astral Plane]] is a strange empty expanse of silvery waves, in which the [[Spiritual Realms]] float like bubbles, until it merges with the blinding energy of the [[Plane of Creation]]. 

Layered on top of this cosmology, the elven scholars speak of the [[Echo Realms]], the distortions and reflections and reverberations of the planes created by the [[Riving]], which still resonance today. Most notably, these include the [[Feywild]], an echo of the material plane, and the [[Dreamworld]], an echo of the plane of souls, but others have been described, including the domains of the [[Shadowfell]], the [[Nightmare Realm]], and the [[Mirror Realm]].

%%SECERT

basic structure of cosmology:

material plane in the middle, with echo realms spinning out from it 
ethereal plane connects to elemental planes and plane of magic

plane of souls is kind of like an echo realm, but for sentient thought; dreamworld and nightmare realm and other similar places are kind of like echos of the plane of souls

land of dead / river of souls is a sharp dividing line - beyond is the deep astral (equivalent to regular D&D astral plane) and the spirit realms of the gods

%% NOTES

During the [[Riving|Riving]], a moment out time both instantaneous and eternal, the [[Divine Presence]] spun something new out of itself, ~soulstuff~, a force of creation wholly distinct from the chaotic energy of magic. From this ~soulstuff~, the [[Divine Presence]] created the [[Embodied Gods]], giving to them the gift of channeling the creative force of ~soulstuff~. Yet, at the same time, the [[Void Mind]] was able to steal a sliver of divinity from the [[Divine Presence]], and carefully sheltered, breathed life-of-sorts into the [[Three Despairs]]. To control and limit the chaos that unfettered creation could produce, the [[Divine Presence]] created a barrier, which later came to be known as the [[Land of the Dead]], through which the magic of creation could not pass, preventing those on the [[Material Plane]] from impacting the multiverse. 

~soulstuff~ in this narrative is the material of the Astral Plane, which forms a gradient from the ~Deep Astral~ which is kind of pure divine creation energy to the "normal" Astral Plane where the "Outer Planes" float, to the Land of the Dead which forms a barrier that prevents the material plane / plane of souls  from impacting the metaverse. The Plane of Souls is the manifestation of the ~soulstuff~ / Astral Plane in proximity to the Material Plane, and the Dreamworld is an echo realm of the plane of souls in a way.


The [[Riving|Riving]] ended, and time began, with the creation of something new: sentient creatures, endowed with the soul stuff by their divine creators. These were the [[Children of the Embodied Gods]], and from the act of their creation sprung the [[Plane of Souls]]. 

left unresolved in this narrative is the exact relationship between the elder folk, plane of souls, land of the dead, embodied gods, and ~soulstuff~. The key detail is that at the end of the Riving, the Embodied Gods exist, ~soulstuff~ / Astral Plane / Plane of Souls exist, the elder folk are created, but there is a barrier, a wall that prevents "unfettered creation".

At the start of the Age, [[Riving]], resulted in:
* The creation of the [[Echo Realms]] and the [[Energy Realms]] and the departure of many of the powerful [[Great Wyrms]], [[Archfey]], [[Titans]], and the elemental powers to other planes
%% the metaphysics needs a little more thought - Echo Realms and Energy Realms are clear enough but it isn't obvious that titans who flee, or great wyrms, make sense to end up in one of those places. %%
* The creation of the [[Embodied Gods]] and their creations, the [[Elder Folk]]
* The creation of the [[Three Despairs]], and in turn, their creations: [[Thark]], the [[Goddess of the End]], the [[Endless Chaos]],  the [[Mad One]] 
   %% note: see below about orcs; possible to move Thark's creation if it should align with creation of orcs %%
* The unleashing of the curses of necromancy and lycanthropy on the world
