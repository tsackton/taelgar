# Extraplanar Weak Point

Scattered across the material plane are points where other planes drift close in extraplanar space, creating a location where extraplanar energy leaks across planar boundaries. 

Although these are not portals, and do not provide a means to travel between planes, they are places where strange magic is common. Some extraplanar weak points are longstanding and thought to be permanent, perhaps relics of the incomplete separation of the planes during [[The Riving]]. Others are temporary, created by powerful magic.

Notable extraplanar weak points include:
- Near [[Tokra]], in the [[Dunmari Basin]], a pair of weak points have existed for time immemorial. One, south of the city, connects to [[Arborea]]. The other, north of the city, connects to [[Pandemonium]]
- In the lizardfolk jungle realm of [[Orekatu]], there is place known as the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], a place where the separation of the planes during [[The Riving]] was incomplete, and the elemental energy of the [[Elemental Realms]] leaks into the material plane.
- At the old Drankorian ruin known as the [[Elemental Forge]], on the [[Freccilia]] River in [[Cymea]], an extraplanar weak point to the [[Elemental Realms]] was maintained by a bound elemental creature known as [[Shâ€™shethis]], until the bonds were broken and the creature freed by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] in DR 1749.
