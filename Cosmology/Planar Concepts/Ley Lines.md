# Ley Lines

The elven philosopher [[Avariel]] coined the term Ley Lines to describe the numerous tendrils of the Plane of Magic that seem to contact the Material Plane and power the magical abilities of arcane spellcasters, hypothesized to be the remnants of the [[Riving]], threads of the [[Plane of Magic]] left behind when the planes were separated, a patchwork lattice of connection through which arcane magic leaks into the world, for those with skill to channel it. In the [[Standard Multiversal Model]], ley lines are described as a type of [[Extraplanar Weak Point]], where the [[Plane of Magic]] bleeds into the [[Material Plane]], although many arcane practiioners perfer the metaphor of rivers of energy popularized by the followers of [[Planar Dualism]]. 

Ley lines are generally though to be relatively uniformly distributed across the [[Material Plane]]. However, [[Gaius Devarro]], in his early study [[An Exploration of Magical Connections Between the Planes]], cataloged a number of rumors and legends about ley lines, including the hypothesis that, in some places in the world where ley lines are disrupted or absence, arcane magic behaves strangely, or not at all.  

To those who can see them, they appear as a lattice of shimmering ropes stretching across the landscape.

Ley lines are canonically intended to be, effectively, extraplanar weak points to the Plane of Magic itself.

While Seeker can see them, it is not determined whether this is something all arcane spellcasters can do, or whether Seeker is special somehow. I believe Delwath cannot see them, and Riswynn definitely cannot, suggested they are associated specifically with arcane magic (which does not perfectly match with D&D mechanics, but would suggest that wizards, artificers, and some/most sorcerers/bards/warlocks can see them, but likely not druids, rangers, clerics, or paladins). 

Whether they have any in-world or mechanical effects is less clear:
- At one point early on I developed a bunch of ley line mechanics for Eric to use, but he never really was interested in them and they (a) never got play tested, and (b) are from a point when I was just starting to homebrew things for D&D and probably aren't that great anyway. Nonetheless, they exist and can be found here: [[Ley Lines - Old Mechanics]]
- Early in the Dunmar Frontier campaign there was some concept (carried over from high school) of nodes, where ley lines intersect and create points of particular magical power. This is largely obsolete.
- More likely is that ley lines are more or less everywhere, although the density may vary, but regions with a stark absence of ley lines may also be dead magic zones or otherwise "weird" magically. In Seeker's backstory, there is a note about an unusual volcano erupting and distorting ley lines around it (potentially on the edge of the ruins of [[Urlich Pass]]). Since Darakun is not in a region typically associated with volcano activity there may be something to this.
