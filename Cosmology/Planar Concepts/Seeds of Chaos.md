# Seeds of Chaos

%%^Campaign:dufr%%
The Seeds of Chaos are a term used by the [[Heroes of the Great War|Hero of the Great War]] [[Rai]], and later by the Dunmari monks of the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]], to describe the fragments of extraplanar chaos scattered across the [[Plaguelands]], and perhaps elsewhere, by the death of [[Cha'mutte]]. Although the exact metaphysics of these seeds of chaos is not understand, [[Rai]] theorized that these fragments of [[Cha'mutte]]'s essence functioned as seeds through which [[Extraplanar Weak Point|extraplanar weak points]], or even [[Elemental Vortex|elemental vortexes]], connected to [[Limbo]] and the [[Abyss]] (the planes most associated with Cha'mutte), grew. 

Rai, however, apparently never returned from his [[Second Dream of Rai|encounter]] with these fragments of [[Cha'mutte]]'s essence.

The only canonical invention around Seeds of Chaos has to do with Cha'mutte's death and the aftereffects. However, there is no reason the basic concept must be limited to Cha'mutte. 

The same process could be reused for other upheavals, e.g. the end of the Downfall Wars.
