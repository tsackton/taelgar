# Outer Realms

The Outer Realms are a concept proposed by [[Yendalism|followers]] of the [[Stoneborn|stoneborn]] metaphysicist [[Yendalo]], that represent the collection of planes that are beyond the barrier of the [[Land of the Dead|Divine Veil]] (contrast with the [[Inner Realms]]). These include primarily the [[Spiritual Realms]], but [[Land of the Dead|Divine Veil]] itself, and the [[Plane of Creation]] are also considered Outer Realms of a sort. 

[[Yendalism|Yendalists]] argue that this classification is superior to others, as the Outer Realms represent the planes on which the souls of the dead can sustain themselves without fading or being cursed with undeath.

The Outer Realms - whatever the metaphysical truth of this classification - are metaphysically important as creatures native to these planes cannot be killed except on their native plane. If they are killed elsewhere, they simply reform on their native plane, but if they are killed on their native plane, they cease to exist entirely. 

These planes are also made of, and sustained by, [[Soulstuff]].
