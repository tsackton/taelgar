%% This page is intended to hold discussions and theories about the Cosmos before the Riving. Some old thoughts, likely no longer true:

Cosmology was much simpler than after the Riving. Only the [[Material Plane]], the [[Plane of Magic]], the [[Plane of Creation]], and the transitive connecting planes (the [[Astral Plane]] and [[Ethereal Plane]]) existed. The exact configuration of these planes is unclear and there is no canonical answer; the key point is that the other planes did not exist, not that these planes existed in some particular form. 

Earlier invention suggests at perhaps there was only an undifferentiated "plane" that included the plane of magic and the material plane, but a canonical answer does not exist, and is probably not needed
