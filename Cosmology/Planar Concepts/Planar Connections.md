# Planar Connections

%%^Campaign:none%%

In general, it is probably best to think about three general kinds of planar connections:

(1) [[Extraplanar Weak Point|Extraplanar weak points]] are places that draw the flavor of another plane towards the Material Plane, and color the local region around them "plane-ish". But they don't allow travel or even facilitate travel, and they generally shouldn't turn into portals. In game terms, these are (a) an in-world lore way to provide for magic item creation (since the extraplanar energies facilitate magic item creation in some unspecified ways), and (b) provide places for planar adventure vibes without traveling to other planes. 

(2) [[Elemental Vortex|Elemental vortexes]] are presumably examples of a broader class of planar phenomenon that involve temporary and unpredictable connections between planes, usually connected to or appearing in places that are already kind of like the other plane (e.g., [[Elemental Vortex|elemental vortexes]] to the Plane of Air appearing in the center of tornados). These can, and do, unwittingly transport people between planes, mostly in the context of stories and legends. [[Shakun's Protection]] is likely in some sense an [[Elemental Vortex]] to Shakun's Realm, and a variety of "fey vortexes" probably exist in a variety of contexts that explain stories of people unwittingly finding themselves in the Feywild, or explain things that are not quite as stable as true portals. 

(3) Actual planar portals let you simply walk to another plane. These can be permanent features of the world ([[Lastlight Falls]]), or temporarily created by magic (e.g., the Gate spell). These should be quite rare, although portals to the Feywild may be relatively more common (but I think many "portals" to the Feywild may actually be more akin to "fey vortexes" than true portals). Generally speaking the distinction is at least in part about whether you can accidentally walk through. Planar portals are usually pretty obvious - you can see the other plane on the other side, for example.
