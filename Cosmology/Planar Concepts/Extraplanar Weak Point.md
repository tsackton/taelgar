# Extraplanar Weak Point

%%edits in progress%%

In most multiversal models, including the [[Standard Multiversal Model]], [[Yendalism]], and the multidimensional web model of the elven philosopher [[Avariel]], the planes are thought to exist in a complex space that cannot be straightforwardly depicted, where distance between planes is not a simple linear measure. Thus, as metaphorically described by [[~Chardonian Famous Scholar~]], there are always "places in our physical world of the Material Plane where the walls between planes are thin and you can hear the shouting of the worlds next door if you listen." These are typically known as Extraplanar Weak Points. 

These are not portals: as described by the foundational work [[On Metaphysics]], portals between planes are themselves infinitely long and infinitesimally short at the same time, tunnels that defy logical explanation. Indeed, careful experimentation recorded in the seminal work [[On the Nature of Extraplanar Travel]] showed that it is no easier to traverse across planes at extraplanar weak points than elsewhere. 

However, there are many recorded tales of strange magic being common at these places, thought to reflect the 

Scattered across the material plane are points where other planes drift close in extraplanar space, creating a location where extraplanar energy leaks across planar boundaries. 

Although these are not portals, and do not provide a means to travel between planes, they are places where strange magic is common. Some extraplanar weak points are longstanding and thought to be permanent, perhaps relics of the incomplete separation of the planes during the [[Riving]]. Others are temporary, created by powerful magic.

Notable extraplanar weak points include:
- Near [[Tokra]], in the [[Dunmari Basin]], a pair of weak points have existed for time immemorial. One, south of the city, connects to [[Arborea]]. The other, north of the city, connects to [[Pandemonium]]
- In the lizardfolk jungle realm of [[Orekatu]], there is place known as the [[Azta Lekua|Footprint of the Gods]], a place where the separation of the planes during the [[Riving]] was incomplete, and the elemental energy of the [[Energy Realms]] leaks into the material plane.
- At the old Drankorian ruin known as the [[Elemental Forge]], on the [[Freccilia]] River in [[Cymea]], an extraplanar weak point to the [[Energy Realms]] was maintained by a bound elemental creature known as [[Shâ€™shethis]], until the bonds were broken and the creature freed by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] in DR 1749. 
- Somewhere in the mountains south of [[Cedrano]], there are rumors of an extraplanar weak point connected to some kind of [[Shadowfolds]] domain, associated somehow with the [[War of the Dark Rift]].
