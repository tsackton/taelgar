# Divine Spark

%%^Campaign:none%%

The Divine Spark is the power that allows humanity to create Incorporeal Gods, more or less. 

There is a lot of brainstorming on this:
- [[Discord Chat - Deep History]]
- [[Discord Chat - Multiverse]]
- [[Discord Chat - Homes of Incorporeal Gods]]
- [[History of Humanity Notes]]

Some possible context around the not-yet-developed "worship Divine Presence Directly Religion":
- [[Discord Chat - Green Sea]]
- [[Email - Eastern Religion I]]
- [[Email - Eastern Religion II]]
- [[Email - Human Religions in MTP]]
- [[Email - Skaer]]

However, very little has been settled in-game, even to the point it is not obvious what the open questions are.
