# The Land of the Dead

The Land of the Dead is universally acknowledged, by diverse religious and metaphysical traditions across Taelgar, as the vast, mysterious gathering place for the souls of the dead. When an ensouled creature dies, its consciousness fades quickly from the [[Plane of Souls]], but does not immediately disappear into nothingness. Instead, the souls of the dead drift across the Land of the Dead, a place with many names and many descriptions across human and non-human cultures alike, waiting. Most souls, theologians believe, are taken up by their chosen deity and swept out of the Land of the Dead, to dwell in the Divine Realm of their deity. However, some, who have made dark deals with evil powers, may be claimed by more nefarious powers, and others, perhaps, simply fade away into nothingness after a time. 

>[!quote] Descriptions of the Land of the Dead
>The journey of the soul is a common motif in art and literature, often based upon the experiences of those who have returned from the dead, although these people usually struggle to articulate exactly what they saw there.

>The most famous depiction comes from the epic poem _[[The Song of the Shattered, Reborn]]_, which describes the Land of the Dead as a vast gray expanse, empty except for the occasional distant clump of humanoid figures, the ground a uniform fine gray silt, the sky quiet and unchanging, a gray, monochrome sun hanging in the sky. Vividly, this epic describes the pull of the far shore, the ground itself as flowing like an outgoing tide, gently and inexorably drawing one forward.

>In [[Mos Numena]] theology, the Land of the Dead is often described as (and sometimes referred to) as a River of Souls, souls flowing from their source on the [[Material Plane]] back to the ocean of the [[Divine Realms]]. Indeed, the metaphor is often extended to describe the miracle of the [[Gifting of the Soul]] as Divine rain that falls on the world. It is from Mos Numenan poets and writers that we get the vivid descriptions of the Land of the Dead as vast warm twilight sea in which the souls of the dead gently float together. In the words of the priest [[Emmeline of Fellburn]], who wrote of her experience returning from the dead, "The first moment I remember is walking, across a sandy shore, the ground cool beneath my feet, the sky dark, the land lit by a twilight glow from beneath my feet. As I walked - I do not know how long - I began to sink, and as I did the sand grew finer, and finer, until I was swallowed up, and found myself being pulled along in a twilight land, no horizon that one could see. Others gathered to me, drifting nearby, but never close enough to reach. The light grew brighter and brighter ahead and the current pulling me grew stronger and stronger. Then I was pulled back, as if by a rope."

### The Journey of Souls

In most religious traditions around Taelgar, the Land of the Dead is of key theological importance as the locus of the transition between the [[Plane of Souls]] and the [[Divine Realms]], and the setting of the journey of the soul back to its creator in the [[Divine Realms]]. A number of religious traditions exist to ensure that the souls of the dead reach the Land of the Dead safely, and are protected on their journey through the Land of the Dead to the [[Divine Realms]]. 

### The Divine Veil

Famously, [[Yendalo]] the [[Stoneborn]] forcibly argued in his treatise [[On the Power of Creation]] that the Land of the Dead is, from a cosmological point of view, best understood of as a veil that shields the [[Inner Realms]] from the full onslaught of the divine power of Creation. Indeed, its appearance and role as a gathering place of the dead is purely coincidental: as souls are, naturally, made of [[Soulstuff]], it simply takes time for souls to diffuse through the barrier of the Divine Veil. As evidence, [[Yendalo]] pointed to the observation that all depictions of the Land of the Dead share some kind of motive force, something that pulls or attracts souls, which he interprets as the longing of [[Soulstuff]] to return to the [[Plane of Creation]]. 

While most theologians reject the idea that the Journey of Souls is simply the mechanical process of [[Soulstuff]] diffusing across a cosmological barrier, it is generally accepted that Divine power flows far more easily though the channels provided by souls, and that for deities to manifest the power of creation directly in the [[Material Plane]] often carries a great cost. Thus, it only through link through the barrier of the Land of the Dead provided by the connection between the Divine and the [[Soulstuff]] of the [[Plane of Souls]] that most miracles occur, although there are [[Founding of Dunmar|dramatic exceptions]]. 
### Inhabitants of the Land of the Dead

*See more: [[Gidari]]*

The Gidari are strange creatures, rarely encountered by mortals, but frequently described by those who return from death. They are the guardians, protectors, and guides of souls while they traverse the [[Land of the Dead]]. They make sure that these souls reach their destination beyond the veil, and they prevent interference with the journey of souls. While Gidari take no sides in the conflicts over mortal souls, they are implacable enemies of those would violate the sanctity of dead souls.

### Traveling to the Land of the Dead

Tales of the living traveling to the Land of the Dead, and safely returning, are few and far between. Indeed, as reported by the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers|Philosopher's Guild]], the living run great risks in traveling to the Land of the Dead. Living bodies cannot sustain themselves in the Land of the Dead: water turns to dust, food to ash, and sleep is impossible, though the body does not stop needing these things to survive. Thus, travelers to the Land of the Dead, if they do not leave quickly, find themselves wasting away. 

Worse, being on the Land of the Dead for more than a short time saps the will of a living soul to remain alive. Over time, the will to live and connection to the living world fades, and the body falls away, revealing the soul laid bare, dead.

The Land of the Dead has a number of important impacts and details.
### Resurrection Magic

*These are guidelines for how resurrection magic interactions with the journey of the soul.*

- _Revivify_ can only bring back a dead creature before its soul has departed the [[Material Plane]] and entered the Land of the Dead. This usually happens quickly, hence the 1 minute limitation on _Revivify_ although spells like _Gentle Repose_ can suspend the journey of the soul for a time. 
- _Raise Dead_, _Reincarnate_, and other spells that have a 10 day limit can retrieve a soul from the Land of the Dead and restore it to the body (or a new body), but cannot find a soul that has passed beyond the Land of the Dead into the [[Spiritual Realms]] beyond, or a soul that has faded from existence. Note the key limitation of these spells is the Land of the Dead component, and while this should typically take 10 days (this is the traditional understanding of the length of the journey of the soul in most religions), it can be longer or shorter depending on the in-world context. 
- _Resurrection_ or _True Resurrection_ or _Wish_ are the only spells that can bring back the dead once the soul has passed on beyond the Land of the Dead, and of these only the 9th level spells can restore a soul that has faded from existence, because for example it was not taken up into any of the [[Spiritual Realms]]. The time restrictions in these spells is not related to the journey of the soul, and should be interpreted in-world more as limitation on what magic can do, in my opinion. 

## Travel to the Land of the Dead

- To use Plane Shift to travel to the Land of the Dead requires as a material component the body of a person whose soul is currently in the Land of the Dead (so generally someone dead < 10 days). 
- It is dangerous to remain in the Land of the Dead for long. You cannot benefit from a long rest, and you cannot eat, drink, or sleep (but this does not prevent you from getting tired, hungry, and thirsty). So anyone trapped in the Land of the Dead will quickly die, usually from dehydration. Even if you somehow avoid these more mundane dangers, time in the Land of the Dead saps the will of the living to live, and eventually everyone who is trapped here dies. What happens to your body if you die in the Land of the Dead is not clear (it isn't like there are bacteria or scavengers for it to decompose; probably the [[Gidari]] deal with it somehow).
