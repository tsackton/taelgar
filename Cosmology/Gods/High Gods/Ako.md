# Ako

In the [[Kestavo]] tradition, one [[High Gods|creator god]] is acknowledged, called Ako. The small gods, the [[Kestavo]], carry the prayers of their communities to Ako, who grants blessings. It is from Ako that the power of the [[kestavo]] flow to their worshippers.

%% metaphysical truth:

Ako, of course, is also [[Arha]] and [[Malik]], also [[Anida]] -- Ako is just another name for the creative force of divinity that birthed the cosmos of Taelgar.
