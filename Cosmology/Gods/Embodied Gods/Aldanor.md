The living tree, one of the two creator deities of the elves. 

%%^Campaign:none%%

There is very little that has been definitively established, other than a "tree vibe" and the idea that Aldanor is the elven connection to Taelgar in a way, and perhaps the source of the mela and the fertility of elves. (see [[Elven Cycle of Generations]])

The large trees in the elven forest are reminiscent of Aldanor in a way. If gendered, probably he.
