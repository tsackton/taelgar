# The Embodied Gods

The divinities known as the Embodied Gods are the direct creations of the Divine Presence, given physical form, permanence and consciousness, and the power to create. Unlike the [[Incorporeal Gods]], the Embodied Gods do not depend upon belief for their power. 

The most well known of the Embodied Gods are the deities of the Elder Folk, often known as the Firstborn: [[Aldanor]] and [[Elmerca]], the Living Tree and the Wild Star of the elves; [[Entamba]], the Elder Mountain of the stoneborn; [[Hazkunde]], [[Bero]], [[Udazkena]], and [[Negu]], sometimes known as Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, the four [[Tharzen Anzinakoa]] of the lizardfolk; the Ruler, Runemaster, Priest, Warrior, Traveler, Stoneworker, and [[Oshkir|Farmer]], the seven [[Bahrazel]] of the dwarves; and Nwana, called the Stranger-Child, Obito, called the Merchant-Musician, and Jemghari, called the Traveler-Storyteller, the two-faced First Ones of the halflings.

Thark, the God of War Without End, created by the union of Umidzka and G’Zab, gave rise to the orcs, and through his compulsion drives them to violence for the sake of violence, although rumors persist of orcs who have thrown off the curse of their god. Elven lore records rumors of other embodied gods spawned by the Three Despairs, including Ghesyn, the Goddess of the End, also known as the Hopeless One, the offspring of G’Zab and Jinnik; the Endless Chaos, the offspring of Umidzka and Jinnik; the Mad One, the embodied avatar of Jinnik.
