Thark, the God of War Without End, created by the union of [[Umidzka]] and [[Gâ€™Zab]], gave rise to the [[orcs]], and through his compulsion drives them to violence for the sake of violence. 

Some [[orcs]], including the [[People of the Rainbow]], the [[orcs]] who now live in [[Xurkhaz]], have found a way to break Thark's hold and live free.
