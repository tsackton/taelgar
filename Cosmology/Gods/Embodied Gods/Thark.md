# Thark

%% need to copy notes from various People of the Rainbow and DM documents %%

Thark, the God of War Without End, created by the union of [[Umidzka]] and [[G'Zab]], gave rise to the [[Orcs]], and through his compulsion drives them to violence for the sake of violence. 

Some [[Orcs]], including the [[People of the Rainbow]], the [[Orcs]] who now live in [[Xurkhaz]], have found a way to break Thark's hold and live free.
