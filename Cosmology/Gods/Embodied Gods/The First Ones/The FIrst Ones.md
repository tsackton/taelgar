# The FIrst Ones

%% reorganize into  religion page separate from deities, and incorporate commented notes %%

The halfling people worship three gods, known collectively as the First Ones or the First Ancestors: Nwana, the Stranger and Child; Obito, the Music Maker and Merchant; and Jemghari, the Storyteller and Traveler. 

The First Ones are often thought of as two-faced gods, each reflecting two aspects of life that are both different and related, one looking inward, the other looking outward. They are also the keepers of the collective mind and soul of the race, the ultimate guardians of the joined spirit of all halflings stretching back to the beginning.

Nwana, the Stranger/Child, reflects the home, hearth, and family, reflecting the duality of the inward-looking child and the outward-looking stranger. Nwana is often thought to watch over both the family you have, and the family you don’t yet know, the idea that for halflings, outsider-ness and insider-ness, strangers and kin, are not separate from each other, but reflect the memories of your body (your family, kin, community) and the memories of your soul (strangers, in halfling communities, being simply people you have not remembered meeting yet). Here, the concept of the other, or strangers, explicitly reflects the nature of other halflings; a separate concept reflects strangers who are not part of the soul/mind community of halflings.  

Obito, the Music Maker/Merchant, reflects joy, community, friendship, creativity, creation, commerce, and trade, again reflected against a backdrop of otherness (Merchant) vs insiderness (Music Maker). 

Jemghari, the Storyteller/Wanderer, reflects the journey and the halfling concept of stories, which are central to their culture, reflecting the halfling idea that there are only two kinds of tales in the world: you go on a journey, or a stranger comes to town, which are really the same story. Jemghari, therefore, is the one who can experience this story from both perspectives at once.

#### Halfling Worship Traditions

Halflings do not have deep traditions of prayer, or organized religious practice. For many halflings, the First Ones are simply the backdrop to life, the guardians and creators of the racial soulmind. Every experience, every memory of a halfling’s life will eventually contribute in some small way to the greater halfling consciousness, and for many halflings simply acknowledging and paying attention to their experience as they go through life is the extent of their worship practice.  

That is not to say that there are no rituals or prayers. Prayers are said at the beginnings and endings of things to call the attention of the First Ones, to ask them to pay attention and help create strong memories and remember those that have passed. History-bearers, those halflings who through practice or divine inspiration have a deeper, and stronger, connection to the racial memory, bear witness to these beginnings and endings, and many halfling prayers are also stories of the past. In this way, the history-bearers serve as a priesthood and to mark occasions.   

Halflings build no temples, rarely settling in one place for long enough to be concerned with the construction of physical monuments to the gods. But halfling shrines dot the landscape, often in natural places that capture particular experiences, that evoke the feelings of an aesthetic that embraces life-as-it-is, not life as something artificially made to be perfect. A small, out of the way path off a main trade road, that leads to a particular ravine or grove of tree or waterfall may turn out to be a sacred halfling shrine.


#### Afterlife
 
Halflings, when they die, do not long linger as individual, distinct souls. Instead, they slowly fade into the halfling soulmind, their memories and personalities becoming diffuse and indistinct, a part of the great ocean of halfling souls. 

In this way, the Divine Realm of the First Ones is less a place than a memory, a superposition of all the experiences, hopes, and dreams of halflings since the dawn of time. 

From Tim in GDrive
considering whether to also include idea I was playing around with, that particular memories become like shrines. Over time, some memories fade, even in the racial consciousness, but others, those that capture this religious feeling, are experienced and re-experienced over and over again, and accumulate more memories to them, so you can not only experience the original memory, but the memory of a particularly famous storyteller experiencing the original memory for the first time. And then layered on top of that would be new memories that echo and reflect these memories. So you might have, say, the shrine to a calm day at sea, which isn't a place, or isn't just a place, but rather is a huge accumulation of memories and experiences. There would still be places -- say a high cliff overlooking a sheltered bay -- where the experience of this memory shrine might feel particularly strong. But also a lot of halfling religious practice would involve praying alongside and in the context of their racial memories, and priests in the halfling tradition would be closely associated with tradition keepers.
