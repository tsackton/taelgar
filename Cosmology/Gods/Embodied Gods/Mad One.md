# The Mad One

Little is known about the Mad One, other than that they are the patron deity of lycanthropes, and are associated with the plane of [[Pandemonium]]. Theologically, they are, like the firstborn gods of the Elder races, an Embodied God, given physical form independent of the belief of their worshippers. 

The Mad One was created by [[Jinnik]], one of the [[Three Despairs]], the god-like entities born of the [[Void Mind]].
