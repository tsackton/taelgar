The tanshi are the small gods worshiped by the [[Deno'qai]] and other followers of the [[Tanshi Worship]] tradition. 

While there are many, many tanshi, perhaps hundreds, most villages and tribes favor a smaller number, and few individuals regularly offer sacrifices and prayers to more than a dozen or so of the tanshi. 

Each individual tanshi is weak, unable to grant miracles on their own: they instead carry prayers to the [[Divine Presence]], known as Anida among the [[Deno'qai]], and serve as a conduit for miracles.
