# Aasimti
*(ah-SEEM-tee)*

%% might turn campaign notes / history into timeline events - not sure though as these might be better appearing on other notes, e.g. Grimbaskal and/or Jordo and/or campaign timeline %%

The spirit of forest leaves and dappled shadows. This tanshi has a long association with the [[Elderwood]] in particular, where they are strongest and most prominent. 

%%Campaign:dufr%%
In DR 1721, [[Jordo]], the Godcaller of the [[Te'kula]], united a fragment of [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand|Rai's hand]] with an ancient tree, a locus of Aasimit's power in the [[Elderwood]]. The spirit of [[Rai]] and Aasimti became entangled, with Rai providing a focus on the material plane to amplify and challenge Aasimti's power. 

In DR 1722, when [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]] attacked the [[Te'kula]] seeking the [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]], Aasimti, challenging divine and arcane power through Rai, was able to shift the [[~Te'kula village~|Te'kula village]] to a demiplane, protecting it from [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]]. 

In DR 1748, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] killed [[Mezzar|Grimbaskal]], and were gifted the [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand]], disentangling Aasimti from [[Rai]] and returning the [[~Te'kula village~|Te'kula village]] to the material plane.
