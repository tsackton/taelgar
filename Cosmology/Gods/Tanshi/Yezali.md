### Yezali

The spirit of the hunt, the moon, and the night. Particularly attracted by offerings from a fresh hunt. 

Trapped in a shadow demi-plane after the defeat of [[Cha'mutte]] in the [[Great War]], and thought dead by the Deno'qai, considered one of the Meswati, the lost tanshi. 

Survived, however, in the demi-plane, and became associated with [[Delwath]], calling themselves Aaviskar. Freed finally by [[Delwath]] in his [[Session 51-52 (DuFr)|adventures]] in the [[Forest of Nightmares]].
