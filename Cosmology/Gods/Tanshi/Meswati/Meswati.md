# Meswati

During the [[Great War]], the [[Northern Tribes]] of the [[Deno'qai]] faced the brunt of [[Cha'mutte]]'s initial attack in the north. In these initial battles of the [[Great War]], the tanshi fought alongside the warriors of the [[Deno'qai]]. However, in the aftermath of the war, six tanshi fell silent, no longer able to answer prayers. 

Among the northern Deno'qai, these six lost tanshi are known as the meswati. As the Deno'qai do not believe tanshi can be killed, it was long assumed that these lost tanshi were taken by [[Cha'mutte]], and trapped or imprisoned somewhere, as a consequence of their role in the battles of the [[Great War]]. 

%%^Date:1748-10-15%%
In DR 1748, an elven hero, [[Delwath]], came among the [[Ko'zula]], seeking [[Session 53 (DuFr)|knowledge of the meswati]]. He joined with [[Aristaea]], a stoneborn warrior, and [[Iascaire]], a powerful druid of [[Istari]], to seek the meswati among the battlefields of the Great War. After [[Session 54 (DuFr)|facing great peril]], [[Delwath]] and his companions [[Session 55 (DuFr)|freed the meswati]]. Since that time, they have returned and now are celebrated among the [[Ko'zula]] for their role in the [[Great War]] as well as their divine nature.

The six meswati are: [[Yezali]], [[K'onisati]], [[Midri]], [[Taraka]], [[Yalik'i]], and [[Nisir]].
