### Bhishma

The mortal founder of [[Dunmar]], the first Samraat (ruler) and the revered mother of the country, now raised to godhood as a demigoddess. Her order sees to the souls of the Dunmari and preserves the stories of the people of Dunmari.

Had two children with [[Laka]]: [[Shakun]], who became divine, and [[Kotana]], who followed her as ruler of the Dunmari and ushured in the first Dunmari golden age of peace and prosperity. 

Her feast day is the [[Feast of Bhishma]].

Her mystery cult, the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]], is largely destroyed, but the remnants that still exist remain focused on telling and preserving the stories of the people of [[Dunmar]], and ensuring that souls of the dead make it safely to the spirit realms.
