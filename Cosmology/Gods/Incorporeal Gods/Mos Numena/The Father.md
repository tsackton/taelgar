# The Father
*he/him*

One of the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] of the [[Mos Numena]], the religious tradition that spread from [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] into much of the western world of Taelgar. 

The  Father is usually depicted as an older man, usually seated, often in gray robes and with gray or white hair, sometimes holding a scepter or staff with a sun motif on the top. He is the God of order, light, and the sun. He is usually associated with summer, and the rising sun, and dawn, and the virtues of justice and fairness. He watches over the trials and judgment, the swearing of oaths, and government.
