# The Wanderer
*(he/him)*

One of the [[Mos Numena|Eight Divines]] of the [[Mos Numena]], the religious tradition that spread from [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] into much of the western world of Taelgar. 

The Wanderer is usually depicted as a young man, dressed as a traveler or a merchant, in a cloak, with a walking staff or a scale. He is the god of travel, trade, and hospitality, and also strangers, outcasts, the downtrodden and those at the edge of society, by choice or birth. He is associated with the stars, and the virtues of charity and hospitality, and watches over journeys, markets, and inns.
