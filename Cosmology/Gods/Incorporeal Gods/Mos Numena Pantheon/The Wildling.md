# The Wildling
>[!info]+ Summary  
> they/them

%% added some minimal notes from discord; don't have any other dm notes, really %%

%% needs some thought about holy symbol %%
A deity in the [[Mos Numena]] pantheon, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

The Wildling is usually depicted as a child of indeterminate gender, but often with adult eyes and facial features, wearing robes of leaves or stone or fire, usually associated with one of the elements. They are the Divine of nature and the elements, of storms and weather, associated with the changing of the seasons, the elements, and the natural features of the land. They watch over mining, forestry, fishing, hunting, as well as the weather and safety from storms.

They are the divine of the constant change in the natural world, and are often seen as having less attention for humans that some of the others of the Eight. 

%% 
In mechanical terms, their clerics would usually be associated with the Tempest or Nature domain, or perhaps the Light domain.

%% discord on wyrdling vs wildling

the one thing I might want to keep is having weather associated with the wyrdling, not the wildling, playing up the association with chance/luck/fate and storms. which also indirectly makes the wyrdling a sort of alternate patron of sailors of a sort

maybe the wyrdling is associated with the effect of the weather, whereas the wildling is associated with the weather itself

the wyrdling though might be associated with the luck of the wind, the chance of rain; the one sailors pray to for good winds

if the monsoon rains don't come you worry that you offended the wilding; if you want good weather for your wedding day you make an offering to wyrdling

vibe: very impersonal sense of the wildling as nature writ large
