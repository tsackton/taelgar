# The Eight Divines

The followers of [[Mos Numena]] worship eight divines. These deities are archetypes: they are not usually thought of as beings with distinct personalities, feelings, or human emotion, but rather as personification of forces and virtues. 

The Eight Divines are:

* [[The Mother]] (goddess of birth, fertility, spring, healing, wisdom, associated with the moon)
* [[The Father]] (god of light, order, justice, summer, associated with the sun)
* [[The Night Queen]] (goddess of darkness, death, sleep, winter, associated with the night)
* [[The Warlord]] (god of war, vengeance, smiths, autumn, associated with day)
* [[The Sibyl]] (goddess of magic, knowledge, love, beauty) 
* [[The Wanderer]] (god of travel, trade, strangers, and outcasts)
* [[The Wyrdling]] (nonbinary deity of chaos, luck, and fate)
* [[The Wildling]] (nonbinary deity of nature and elements)
