A deity in the [[Mos Numena]] pantheon, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

The Mother is usually pictured as a motherly woman, of child-bearing age, sometimes depicted pregnant, and usually with long, flowing hair and white robes, sometimes with flowers in her hair. She is the Goddess of birth and fertility, healing and wisdom. She is usually associated with the spring, and the moon, and the virtue of peace. She watches over births, planting and harvest, and the sick.

In mechanical terms, her clerics would usually be associated with the Life or Peace domain.
