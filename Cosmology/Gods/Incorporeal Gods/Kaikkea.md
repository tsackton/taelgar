Kaikkea, known as the Great Ocean Mother, the Water of Life, and the Eternal Source, is the god of the Skaer people. She is worshipped as the source of all, the mother ocean, the giver of life, but also the bringer of storms and the embodiment of the ocean in all its moods. 

Kaikkea is an ancient god. Her worship dates to well before [[The Downfall]], among the mariner culture of Hkar. These mariners brought the worship of Kaikkea to the [[Green Sea]] when they emigrated from Hkar thousands of years ago.
