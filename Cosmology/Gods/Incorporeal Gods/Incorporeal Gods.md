After Arha and Malik created humans, many gods came into being through the power of belief and the divine spark of humanity. These gods are sustained by the belief of their human worshippers. While they can be very powerful, and have the strength to act in the world itself, their power in Taelgar waxes and wanes with the strength of their worshippers’ belief. 

  

Over the long years of human history, many incorporeal gods have been imagined into being. The early primordial gods of Hkar are many, and most have long faded into silence or oblivion. The most important ones that still retain some lingering power in Taelgar include the demon lords of curses, of chaotic rage and fear, in their home, the Abyss; the archdevils, the manifestation of the worst evils of the human heart, in their home, the Nine Hells; the Earth Mother, the embodiment of the worship of the world itself and the strength and power of nature, in her domain Arborea; and the archangels, the manifestation of the best virtues of humanity, in their home, Celestia. Few of these early primordial gods have organized worshippers in Taelgar in the modern day, and their power to act in the world is much diminished. But these are ancient gods, the oldest of the incorporeal gods, and over the long years they have learned many tricks and secrets to reach into the world. And even now, they can still harvest the divine spark of the inchoate prayers and fears and hopes and nightmares of humanity, to keep their realms from fading to nothing. 

  

As Hkar grew in power, the Mos Numena, usually called the Divine Way or just the Way, was established, worshiping the Eight Divines. This set of worship practices became the dominant in Hkar as well as all the descendant civilizations of that great power, starting with Drankor, and down to the modern civilizations that grew or were influenced by that great empire. The Way focuses worship on the Eight Divines, eight incorporeal gods known as: the Mother, the Father, the Night Queen, the Warlord, the Sibyl, the Wanderer, the Wyrdling, and the Wilding. These gods, old and grown strong with widespread and numerous followers, are among the most powerful of the incorporeal gods.

  

Many humans, however, had left Hkar before the fall, settling across the known world in the shadow of the Elder races. These settlers developed their own beliefs and sets of worship practice, as they spread across the land, and some survived through the Downfall of Hkar, the spread of Drankor, the First Plague, and the Great War. Most prominent in northwestern Taelgar is the Dunmari tradition, worshipping the Holy Family, the siblings Jeevali, Aagir, Chidya, Sonkar, and Laka. But other incorporeal gods linger as well, including the Kestavo of Vostok and the Sembaran highlands, Kaikkea, the ocean god of the Skaer people, and the scattered folk religions of the remnants of the Northlanders who survived the Great War. In the distant lands to the east and south, rumors of other gods persist.
