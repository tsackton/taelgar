# Incorporeal Gods

The Incorporeal Gods are the deities of belief, the many divinities that came into being through the power of belief and the divine spark of humanity. These gods are sustained by the power of their human worshippers. While they can be very powerful, and have the strength to act in the world itself, their power in the material world waxes and wanes with the strength of their worshippers’ belief. 

%% this is maybe not fully canon
Over the long years of human history, many incorporeal gods have been imagined into being. The early primordial gods of Hkar are many, and most have long faded into silence or oblivion. The most important ones that still retain some lingering power in Taelgar include the demon lords of curses, of chaotic rage and fear, in their home, the Abyss; the archdevils, the manifestation of the worst evils of the human heart, in their home, the Nine Hells; the Earth Mother, the embodiment of the worship of the world itself and the strength and power of nature, in her domain Arborea; and the archangels, the manifestation of the best virtues of humanity, in their home, Celestia. Few of these early primordial gods have organized worshippers in Taelgar in the modern day, and their power to act in the world is much diminished. But these are ancient gods, the oldest of the incorporeal gods, and over the long years they have learned many tricks and secrets to reach into the world. And even now, they can still harvest the divine spark of the inchoate prayers and fears and hopes and nightmares of humanity, to keep their realms from fading to nothing.

## Demigods

The divine spark that gives the incorporeal gods life and power is a living thing, and the incorporeal gods can, in times of need, gift some of this power to another, imbuing a powerful creature with some measure of divinity. Although doing so diminishes the giving god, as they give away some of their power, if in turn such an act inspires more belief, they heal and grow stronger through the growing strength of their worshippers. And the receiving creature gains some measure of strength, and becomes a demigod. 

Some demigods attract belief, and grow in power, and become the focus of worship themselves, raising themselves to full godhood. Some even overthrow their divine creators, and become in the eyes of their followers the true divinity. Others, however, never attract divine belief, and so never grow beyond the strength originally imbued in them by their creators. 

A number of demigods dot the landscape of Taelgar. Some, like [[Shakun]] and [[Bhishma]] of the Dunmari pantheon, are minor gods in the story of larger religions. Others, like the [[Fox and Hunter]], are heroes gifted the status of the divine in rewards for their great deeds. Still others have origins that remain shrouded in mystery, such as Vorshitaal, the god of the kenku. 

%% not definitively canon
Theologians and scholars debate whether the embodied gods, like the incorporeal gods, can imbue some of their divine power into powerful creatures, creating lesser gods. Without a way to regain their strength, some say this is impossible, as the embodied gods would be permanently diminished. Others, however, argue the embodied gods are old, and in the Age of Creation when they walked the earth, many things were possible that now are not.
