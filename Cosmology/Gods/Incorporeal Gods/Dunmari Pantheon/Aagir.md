%% Tim: seems "good enough", tagging status/tim to confirm %%
One of [[Five Siblings|the Five Siblings]] of the Dunmari religion, and one of the [[Incorporeal Gods]] of humanity. 

Aagir is god of war, fire, and death. He is the protector of warriors, the fierce defender of the honor of Dunmari and of his siblings, the god of battle, and also the god of redemption, the one who helps the souls of those who were not deemed worthy in life redeem themselves. He is seen sometimes as the rash brother, the one urging action, the one prone to righteous fury and a demand to make things better. He watches over warriors most of all.

His feast day is [[Aagirvala]], the Festival of Aagir's Spear. 

His mystery cult, the [[Aagir Mystai]], have no permanent base but function as traveling guardians of the safety of [[Dunmar]].
