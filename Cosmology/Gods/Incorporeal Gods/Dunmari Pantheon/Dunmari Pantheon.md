# The Dunmari Pantheon


The Dunmari worship a tight pantheon of divinities they believe represent the Divine Family. These include five siblings, and associated demigods. 

**The Five Siblings**
- [[Jeevali]], the goddess of life, rebirth, home, and family; often the major deity associated with temples that are the center of worship in villages and small temporary settlements across [[Dunmar]].
- [[Aagir]], the god of war, fire, and death; protector of soldiers and defender of honor of the Dunmari. 
- [[Sonkar]], the goddess of beauty, truth, artisans, and justice. 
- [[Laka]], the god of knowledge, agriculture, and the seasons; often associated with centers of learning.
- [[Chidya]], the goddess of nature, the land, animals, and weather; worshiped especially by herders and shepherds and those who live a nomadic life.

The Dunmari also acknowledge the power of the creator gods, [[Divine Presence|Shurat]] and [[Divine Presence|Sampa]], and worship other minor gods:
- [[Shakun]]
- [[Bhishma]]
- [[Adra]]
