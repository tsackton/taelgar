### Chidya

The goddess of horses, animals, but also nature, the land, weather, love, outcasts, and wanderers. She is the wild spirit, usually seen as the youngest and most carefree of [[Five Siblings|the Five Siblings]]. She protects those who travel, and especially horses whom she loves most of all. She is seen as the bringer of unseasonable weather, of things out of time, of chance encounters on the road. She is the patron of outcasts and those in love. Although not the most central to Dunmari history, she is often seen as the most approachable of [[Five Siblings|the Five Siblings]] and is the focus of much popular worship for this reason.

Her feast day is [[Jaankar]].
