# Primordial Cosmos

%%^Campaign:none%%

This page is intended to hold discussions and theories about the Cosmos before the Riving. Essentially nothing is canonically determined here, except that the [[Energy Realms]] were created in some way by the Riving, and prior to the Riving the planes were less complex in some way. There are lots of in-world theories but generally little way for a PC in the 1700s to know truth from speculation here. 

Some old thoughts, likely no longer true:

- Cosmology was much simpler than after the Riving. Only the [[Material Plane]], the [[Plane of Magic]], the [[Plane of Creation]], and the transitive connecting planes (the [[Astral Plane]] and [[Ethereal Plane]]) existed. The exact configuration of these planes is unclear and there is no canonical answer; the key point is that the other planes did not exist, not that these planes existed in some particular form. 
- Earlier invention suggests at perhaps there was only an undifferentiated "plane" that included the plane of magic and the material plane, but a canonical answer does not exist, and is probably not needed
- Other old notes can be found at [[GDrive - The Divine Order]] and [[GDrive - History of Taelgar]].
