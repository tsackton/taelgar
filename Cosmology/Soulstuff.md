# Soulstuff

%%^Campaign:none%%

Soulstuff is canonically the "material" of the [[Plane of Creation]], in some sense, although the exact metaphysics are not totally developed. Whether this is something that, in-world, should be well known, speculated about, or totally mysterious is also undecided.

A few things are established:
- Natives to planes "beyond" the [[Land of the Dead]] are made of soulstuff / the raw energy of creation, and cannot be killed on the material plane; they simply reform on their native plane. 
- Soulstuff is somehow connected to divine power, and channeling it past the [[Land of the Dead]] is difficult, although not necessarily impossible.
