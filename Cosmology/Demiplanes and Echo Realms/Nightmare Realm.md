# The Nightmare Realm

Many rumors exist about the hypothesized Nightmare Realm. [[On Metaphysics]] hypothesizes the existence of a corrupted counterpart to the [[Dreamworld]], much as the domains of the [[Shadowfolds]] are described as a corrupted counterpart to the [[Feywild]]. [[Camilla of Drankor]] wrote of the dark extraplanar horrors that even the fey refused to name, presuming they must come from some nightmare place. More recently, [[Nicole Ardouin]] argued that the legends of the Nightmare Realm are likely just variants of the legends of the [[Far Realms]], but her work has always been considered marginal by the authorities of the [[Faculty of Metaphysics]].
