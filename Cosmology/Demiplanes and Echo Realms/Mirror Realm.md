# The Mirror Realm

The Mirror Realm is a hypothesized a place of reflections and mirrors where alternate, twisted versions of the past, present, and future dwell in a strange conglomeration of infinity possibilities. While rumors and speculation about this realm can be found in numerous scholarly works of metaphysics and planar cosmology, there is no firm proof of its existence. 

The most extensive speculation on the Mirror Realm, collected in [[On the Nature of Reflections and Transitive Magic]], claims that the Mirror Realm is real, but very dangerous to access, for entering the Mirror Realm allows your reflection to leave. Thus, no firm proof of the Mirror Realm's existence can be obtained, for travelers to the Mirror Realm are quietly replaced, only to be trapped forever as reflections themselves.

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
In the autumn of 1748, [[Wellby]] [[Session 66 (DuFr)|rescued]] [[Arryn|Arryn the Wanderer]], a strange wizard, from the Mirror Realm, by discovering and destroying his mirror duplicate, in the process being forced to fight a mirror reflection of his traveling companion [[Alimash]], who appeared as the real [[Alimash]] entered the mirror realm.

Some details and vibes:

- Arryn the Wanderer, a powerful wizard obsessed with the Mirror Realm, was able to reach it by following a ritual supposedly passed down from Hkar, from the dawn of humanity, when magic was stronger, Arryn triggered a portal, and was sucked into the mirror realm. Now there, he has discovered that magic does not function, and is trapped.
- The aftereffects were significant: caused a localized distortion of reality where mirror echos of everyone in [[Arryn's tower]] started trying to get out and replace their Material Plane counterparts. 
- There is some kind of connection between the mirror reflections and the real people. This is supposed to be spooky: the mirror reflections attempt to replace the real world creature, leaving the real world creature trapped in the mirror realm, now just a reflection.
- Opening a portal is dangerous and difficult. Probably cannot be reached via Plane Shift, for some reason. And magic does not work normally in the Mirror Realm, so hard to escape once you are trapped, or perhaps impossible, unless you are rescued by someone killing your reflection.
