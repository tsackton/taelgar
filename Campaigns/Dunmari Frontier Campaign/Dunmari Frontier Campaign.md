The Dunmari Frontier Campaign tells the story of the adventures of [[Delwath]], [[Kenzo]], [[Seeker]], and [[Wellby]], along with their frequent companion [[Riswynn]], sometimes known as the [[Dunmar Fellowship]]. 

The events begin in the 191st year of the Nayan Dynasty in Dunmar, or DR 1748 as the Chardonians reckon, in the village of [[Karawa]] in [[Eastern Dunmar]]. Since their humble beginnings fighting gnolls, the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] has grown to a powerful force.

Dunmar Campaign cleanup / to do list

- [ ] Clean up main PC pages
- [ ] Clean up guest pages
- [ ] Clean up companion pages
- [x] Clean up follower pages and figure out how to organize (probably should be via the Dunmar Fellowship page, not this page)
- [x] Clean up Vindristjarna details and figure out how to organize (bastion rules, other mechanics, and in-world history as three separate notes is main idea)
