During the course of the evening, [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]] learn more about [[chalyte]] politics from [[Tiberius]], the Windcaller of the [[Auratan's Pride]], one of the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]]’ naval flagships.

[[Tiberius]] is not a politician, and clearly has some strong opinions about the use and misuse of [[chalyte]]. He explains the basics, though:  

- [[Chalyte]] is one of the regulated monopolies of [[Chardon]] – particular goods that can only be legally sold by registered agents. The sale of monopolies is one of the few powers still retained by the [[Curia of 42]] (which [[Tiberius]] describes as a kind of semi-elected council representing the 21 precincts of the city, although he seems not to pay too much attention details). 

- The bureaucrats at the [[Chamber of Stamps]] controlled all regulated monopolies, but there has been massive chaos there since the [[Eightfold Flame]] protests, with many of the bureaucrats walking out of the Chamber and seemingly vanishing. Though most people aren’t worrying about this right now, with the riots, the Magistros is worried about what this might mean. 

- In recent years, the [[Hetaeri Magica]] has made itself the only organization allowed to purchase processed [[chalyte]] from refineries: anyone who wants to acquire [[chalyte]] has to negotiate a purchase agreement with the [[Hetaeri Magica]], supposedly to prevent the sale to dangerous persons. The [[Windcallers]] have long chafed under this restriction and [[Tiberius]] seems very angry about it. Although he acts understanding about the Magistros’ reluctance to upset this arrangement, he is clearly annoyed. 

- There are four major oligarch families that control mines and refineries: the [[Auratan Family]] (aw-rah-TAHN; mostly third cousins of the Magistros); the [[Veldari Family]] (vel-DAR-ee); the [[Patelios Family]] (pah-TAY-lee-ohs); and the [[Caloren Family]] (kah-LOR-en). [[Tiberius]] doesn’t really know much about them, but does know that the Auratans are the largest and richest of the four, but still control less than 50% of the [[chalyte]] trade themselves. 

- The Magistros is not close to his Auratan cousins. His mother,[[ Domitia Auratan]], was always close to her sister, [[Seva Auratan]], but their branch of the family was focused on politics and did not have direct [[chalyte]] holdings. Domitia died young, soon after having Mitus, and Mitus was largely raised by Seva. Seva was close to her northern cousins when she was young, but after Domitia died and Seva became Magistros she rarely traveled. 

- Fundamentally, he keeps coming back to: [[chalyte]] is dangerous, and letting it be controlled by those who profit from its use is always going to be a recipe for disaster. The strong implication here is that the [[Windcallers]] can use it responsibly, and should not be second class citizens, forced to negotiate with the [[Hetaeri Magica]].
