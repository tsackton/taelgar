# The Ever Spinning Top

A small metal top, of Drankorian origin, that spins continuously while it is being observed. Radiates divination magic. Probably designed not just as a toy, but as a way to detect scrying. 

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
Originally found in [[Agata]]’s hut by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]]. Carried by [[Wellby]] until it was [[Session 44 (DuFr)|taken]] by [[Kadmos]] during a tense midnight parley. Eventually recovered by the party upon [[Session 79 (DuFr)|Kadmos' defeat]].
