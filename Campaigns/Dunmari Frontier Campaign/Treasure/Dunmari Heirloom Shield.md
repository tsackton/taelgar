An elaborate shield from the [[Great War]] era, Dunmari design, found in [[Agata]]'s hut. Subsequently reinforced by [[Jasu]], the smith in [[Karawa]], with adamantine found in the [[Dwarven Outpost (Raven's Hold)|dwarven outpost]] near [[Raven's Hold]]. Destroyed in order to recover the [[Adamantine]] to construct the phasing stone harness on [[Vindristjarna]].
