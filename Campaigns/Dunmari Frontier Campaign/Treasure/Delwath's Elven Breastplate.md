# Delwath's Elven Breastplate

[[Delwath]]'s old battle armor from his time as a quartermaster in the elven armies during the [[Great War]]. Originally worn by [[Delwath]] when he vanished into Cha'mutte's shadow realm, and was trapped. In the shadow realm, it was transformed, infused with the magic of the shadow plane, embedded in a fragment of [[Inkaye]], a strange metal that can absorb extraplanar energy. 

When [[Delwath]] was found, wandering in the desert by [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]], they removed his armor, billowing shadows, to tend to him. He later fled their house, unaware, leaving his armor behind. When [[Delwath]], now with the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], [[Session 20 (DuFr)|met Pava and Avaras again]], they returned the now-magical armor to him. 

[[Delwath]] wore his old armor for some time; later, Delwath [[Session 82 (DuFr)|leaves the amor]] with [[Umli]], who removes the [[Inkaye]] fragment and purifies it, so it can take a new enchantment, returning the now non-magical armor to [[Delwath]]. The [[Inkaye]] is later used by [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] to [[Session 87 (DuFr)|construct the planar prism]] at the [[Elemental Forge]].
