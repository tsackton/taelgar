![[wayfarer-bow.jpg|right|400]]This wooden bow is made of an unusual dark wood, much harder than any mundane wood but incredibly light and flexible. 

%%^Campaign:DuFr%%
This bow was part of the hoard of the black dragon [[Ra'ghemdros]], kept on display as part of her collection of rare and unusual items. It is now carried by [[Wellby]].
