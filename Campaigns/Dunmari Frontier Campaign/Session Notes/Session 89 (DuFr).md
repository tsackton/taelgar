## Narrative
We begin in [[Uzgukhar]], at the celebration of the victory in the [[Battle for Uzgukhar]], after the unveiling of the statue of the hero [[Riswynn]] in the Plaza of Freedom. The party, and especially [[Riswynn]], are hailed as heroes and saviors, and the mood of relief and hope is palpable, overlaid on the mourning for those lost. As the evening progresses, Loremaster [[Azogar]] stands and in his frail but strong voice, speaks [[Tale of the Cloak of Rainbows|the full story]] of the [[Cloak of Rainbows]]. 

For the next few days, the party rests in [[Uzgukhar]], giving time for [[Wellby]] to recover from his death, and taking a well-deserved breather after the battle. [[Kenzo]] marks the Dunmari new year, the 192nd year of the [[Nayan Dynasty]], on January 23rd, beginning to develop his own new traditions of meditation and worship. As they prepare to leave, to head west to reconnect with Pava and [[Avaras]] and perhaps recruit [[Amil]] to join their crew, two orc women approach, [[Nuzkar]] and [[Aygul]], asking to join the crew. That day, January 24th, is an uneventful day of travel over the [[Garamjala Desert]]. 

The next day, January 25th, the party receives another message from the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers|Philosopher's Guild]], concerning [[Jade Piece of Rai's Hand|Rai's hand]]. The [[Philosopher's Information Concerning Rai's Hand|message]] is strange. After discussing the message for a short time, the party finds themselves passing over the now-empty city of [[Gazetteer/Greater Dunmar/Hara Basin/Kharsan]], once Grash's base, and decides to investigate. [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] sees this as a perfect opportunity to be allowed to fly [[Vindristjarna]], but the party is not quite ready to allow this, it seems.

[[Gazetteer/Greater Dunmar/Hara Basin/Kharsan]] seems relatively quiet. The party explores the palace, which was once Grash's headquarters, but now seems abandoned. The stables and great hall are ruined and cleared out; further searching uncovers a few restless haunted spirits of the plague dead in the old kitchens, which are easily dispatched. The remains of Grash's looting operation are also in the palace, along with a few treasures missed or destroyed. The most informative find is what looks like a planning room, with a map table and slate to draw on. It has been smashed, but from the available pieces and clues it seems pretty clear that [[Grash]] was planning on attacking [[Dunmar]] had he succeeded in getting the [[Cloak of Rainbows]]. 

Exploring the rest of the city, the party casually slays a few more specters, and stumbles across the library, which is now a giant wasp nest, but the wasps are immediately destroyed by [[Delwath]]'s sickening radiance spell. Although most of the paper has been shredded and turned to giant wasp nesting material, something might be salvageable, and it is packed for transport to [[Vindristjarna]] where perhaps [[Nuzkar]] will see what she can decipher from it. The party also briefly explores the orc warren, which is empty, but the central building contains a series of gruesome murals depicting [[Grash]] is battle, slaughtering defenseless innocents as the avatar of [[Thark]].   

The next morning, on January 26th, the party briefly returns to [[Gazetteer/Greater Dunmar/Hara Basin/Kharsan]] with the orcs [[Nuzkar]] and [[Aygul]]. [[Nuzkar]] is deeply saddened by the orc warren, mourning the hundreds of orcs who must have been born and bound to [[Thark]] here, and asks the party to burn it all. [[Kenzo]] and [[Riswynn]], as the orc warren burns, cleanse the spirits of the place as well, and see not just the orcs, but many others, especially the Dunmari who died in the [[Great War]], trapped between the plague consuming [[Gazetteer/Greater Dunmar/Hara Basin/Kharsan]] and a wall of fire summoned to prevent them from reaching the safety of the [[Gazetteer/Greater Dunmar/Hara Basin/Monastery of Bhishma]] nearby. As the fire burns, [[Kenzo]] feels [[Bhishma]]'s hand freeing the trapped, lost souls still stuck here, and [[Wellby]] briefly sees again the [[Land of the Dead|river of souls]] where he spent an hour before being resurrected by [[Riswynn]]'s magic. 

That afternoon, before departing [[Gazetteer/Greater Dunmar/Hara Basin/Kharsan]], the party looks at the [[Broken Dunmari Sword Vision|broken Dunmari sword]] in [[Mirror of the Past]]. The next day the party travels west, and arrives at [[Pava and Avaras' House]] on January 28th. Here, they meet [[Kethra]], a dwarven smith and great-grandaughter of [[Nora Silverspark]], who has traveled far searching for [[Riswynn]], hoping she'll be her mentor. They also speak at length with [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]], who are very happy to see everyone looking so well. [[Pava]] wishs to record [[Delwath]]'s story, and is amazed at how [[Kenzo]] has started to reinterpret and expand the [[Bhishma]] traditions of storytelling in new ways, asking if [[Kenzo]] would take [[Amil]] with him as an apprentice. The party spends the next day just catching up and resting at [[Pava and Avaras' House]].

As they prepare to leave on January 30th, with [[Amil]] and [[Kethra]] joining the crew of [[Vindristjarna]], [[Pava]] updates them on the situation in [[Dunmar]], between [[Sura]] and [[Nayan Karnas]]. We end as the party considers intervening.
