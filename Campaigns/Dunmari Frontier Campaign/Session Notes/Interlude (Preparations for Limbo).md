Over several weeks in Tolin, they bartered knowledge and goods with the Philosopher's Guild and combed the Bastion’s stacks and the University at Tolin for ways to endure Limbo, mend a limbo wound, and cleanse the Material Plane. The strongest leads on bioremediation came from the Tolin Library, the Bastion Libraries, and the Seeker’s Brain; on wounds, they identified the dust of glimness as key. For living within Limbo, they secured a rare greatsword and arranged additional protections, including tattoos, as needed.

They prepared a Contact Other Plane rite from the Bastion to reach Rye, setting five questions around the monks’ survival, the nearness of the bugs, whether travel and rendezvous within Limbo were feasible, and whether any crucial ingredients must be carried in. Plotting their route from Tolin to Izige, they resolved to halt in Orinloss to bring word of Apollyon’s fall to the ancient elf who once fought him and to seek elven counsel and aid. The aim was a communal cleanup culminating in placing the heart root; the risk was simple: arrive unready, and Limbo could hold them as long as it pleased.

### Tolin research and Limbo plans

- The party spent several weeks in Tolin studying survival in Limbo, healing Limbo wounds, and cleansing the Material Plane using the Bastion archives and the University at Tolin.
- They traded information and items with the Philosopher's Guild and arranged to acquire protective tattoos and other needed gear in Tolin.
- They resolved to stop in Orinloss on the way to Izige to inform the ancient elf who fought Apollyon of his fall and to seek elven counsel for the cleanup.
- They envisioned a communal bioremediation effort to cleanse the blight and to set the heart root together with allies.
- They prepared a planar communion from the Bastion to reach Rye with five questions about the monks’ survival, nearby bugs, navigation in Limbo, and whether crucial ingredients were needed.
- They identified key sources and tools: bioremediation lore from Tolin Library, Bastion Libraries, and the Seeker’s Brain; remedies tied to the Dust of Glimness; and survival methods linked to a greatsword.
