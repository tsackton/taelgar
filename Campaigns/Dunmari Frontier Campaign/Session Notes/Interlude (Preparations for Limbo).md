## Philosopher's Guild Information

The party trades the Dust of Glibness from [[Ra'ghemdros' Hoard]] for information about how to heal extraplanar wounds, and the Frostbrand Greatsword, also from [[Ra'ghemdros' Hoard]], for information about how to travel safely in [[Limbo]]. They receive these letters:

[[Philosopher's Information Concerning Extraplanar Wounds]]
[[Philosopher's Information Concerning Limbo]]

## Knowledge from *Contact Other Plane*

The party asks a number of questions of extraplanar powers, include several for [[Rai]] himself, as well as follow up questions for the [[Tanshi]]. 
### Questions to Rai
*Are the monks of the Awakened Soul alive?* **Answer: in a sense**
*Are they near you?* **Answer: yes**
*Can you move?* **Answer: no**
*Do we need to bring anything in particular to Limbo to heal the wound?* **Answer: not that I know**

## Research in Tollen

The party searched in the [[University of Tollen]] and the various libraries and other sources of information on [[Vindristjarna]] for knowledge about [[Limbo]], about [[Isingue]], about extraplanar wounds and the nature of the multiverse, and a variety of other topics potentially relevant to the journey to [[Limbo]].
