## Narrative

Our session begins in [[Emberwine]] as the party follows [[Auntie Mulberry]]'s enchanting flute melody through [[Emberwine]]. [[Lady Eventide]], speaking through [[Seeker]]'s possessed form, reminisces about [[Lord Soven]] as they approach the massive pavilion bathed in golden light, and slip into the current of the dance after being greeted by a steward offering refreshments. 

![[emberwine-party-1.png|600]]

Drifting through the crowd, the party meets [[Lord Soven]] himself, a seven-foot-tall figure with antlered head, who invites [[Delwath]] to dance while they speak. When Delwath mentions Cloudspinner's imprisonment, Lord Soven falters noticeably, shocked: "None of us ever thought the [[Cloudspinner]] could return," he admits.

As the party splits up to gather information, [[Kenzo]] meditates at the periphery, connecting with the natural world. Unlike his typical experiences, he's overwhelmed by emotions pouring from every vine and fruit—pleasure and sweetness, but with troubling undertones of overripeness, as though the land strains to maintain this celebration.

[[People/PCs/Dunmar Fellowship/Wellby]], moving through the crowds looking for someone out of place, encounters [[Valeris]], a satyr cursed to speak only brutal truth after helping a fey woman escape an oath. Valeris reveals the deterioration of the Feywild following Cloudspinner's disappearance and mentions the [[Shrouded Archive]] where all secrets are kept, as well as [[Count Vashan]], a member of Cloudspinner's court now lost in drink in [[Emberwine]]. 

[[Riswynn]] befriends [[Ismara]] of [[Gleamwater]], a scholar of humanity eager to document the party's adventures. From [[Ismara]], the party hears about [[Amberglow]]: the [[Cloud Palace]] with its six towers, now crashed; [[Redsun Watch]] standing before a crystallized [[Sunset Gate|wall of sunset colors]]; [[Heartwood Grove]], now dark and rotting; and the northern outposts of Amberglow overtaken by the mysterious [[Lord Umbraeth|Gloomshaper]]. 

[[People/PCs/Dunmar Fellowship/Delwath]] meets [[Arendel]], a renowned but cheerful and friendly duelist who challenges him on the spot. Their duel draws a crowd, including drawing back other members of the party who had wandered off. [[Arendel]] ultimately wins but acknowledges Delwath's skill. As payment, [[Delwath]] must entertain [[Arendel]] with stories for two days.

After the duel, the goes to find [[Count Vashan]], who is now calling himself "the broken mask". He is slumped at the edge of festivities, clearly deep in drink. [[Delwath]] boldly declares that [[Cloudspinner]] is alive, and [[Lady Eventide]] recognizes Vashan as one of Cloudspinner's most trusted servants, but the Count does not deign to speak of the past. Suspecting the fey wine is clouding his memories, [[Kenzo]] channels his ki to temporarily suppress the magic afflicting Vashan's mind, jolting him to awareness of his past. 

The effect is immediate. [[Count Vashan]]'s eyes clear as the truth emerges: he betrayed [[Cloudspinner]], bringing [[Cha'mutte]] to the [[Cloud Palace]] during a moment of vulnerability, though whether intentionally or by accident, he can no longer remember. Though ashamed and angry, he offers crucial information: each of the keeps along the [[Sunset Gate]] contain hidden chambers allowing them to connect to the [[Prismwell]], once used as a means of communication, defense, and perhaps more--[[Count Vashan]] does not know. However, the connection to the [[Prismwell]] can only be activated by the light of pure sunset. 

After deliberation, the party decides to take the direct route, traveling west to the [[Sunset Gate]] and north to [[Redsun Watch]] (where they hope that [[Riswynn]]'s magic can activate the connection to the [[Prismwell]]), rather than seeking the [[Shrouded Archive]] and negotiating for access to the secrets kept within (which, one presumes, include the secret location of the [[Prismwell]]). They secure griffins from [[Lord Soven]], and prepare to set off. 

In preparation for departure, [[Wellby]] tames the wyvern trapped in the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], using food, wine, and his remarkable animal handling skills. Kenzo joins him atop the creature as they soar above [[Sunwine Hall]], much to the astonishment of the gathered fey.

[[Valeris]] and [[Ismara]] agree to join their expedition, though [[Ismara]] expresses hesitation about continuing northward into [[Amberglow]] and only promises to travel as far as the [[Sunset Gate]]. As the session ends, the seven travelers mount their griffins and wyvern, launching into the sky as they leave [[Sunwine Hall]] behind, setting course for the [[Sunset Gate]] and the ruins of [[Amberglow]] beyond.

## Wellby and Valeris - Extended Narrative

Wellby's eyes scanned the revelry, noting how the fey danced and laughed with abandon. Every face seemed caught in perpetual delight—which is why the pouting satyr caught his attention so immediately. Sitting apart from the merriment, the satyr cut a striking figure with his curling ram's horns wrapped in gold rings, his silk shirt half-buttoned, and a fiddle tucked under one arm.
Curious, Wellby approached and introduced himself with a friendly smile. "You're the first satyr I've met who isn't dancing. Why no celebration for you?"

The satyr looked up, his expression souring further. "Damn! Why do you have to ask that?" He sighed deeply, adjusting his position. "Well, I'm cursed. Everything I say has to be brutally and completely honest." His lips quirked into a sardonic smile. "You'd be surprised how often little white lies smooth over social graces. For example, I could say you look pretty out of place, but instead, all I can really say is, why did you come here, and why are you bothering me?"

Despite his harsh words, there was something oddly charming in his directness. Wellby, intrigued rather than offended, settled beside him.

"I've run into people with curses before and found ways to remove them," Wellby offered. "How did you come to be cursed? It doesn't look like any of these people would do that to you."

The satyr rolled his eyes. "It's a long story, and honestly, I'm pretty sick of telling it. But if you insist, I can't really say no so well." He glanced around before continuing. "I grew up here in Emberwine. It's a beautiful place, you can tell." He gestured broadly at the endless celebration. "Just looking around, you have to admit it's beautiful."

He explained how, at a revel much like this one, he encountered a woman named Yasara the Golden from Everlights Bloom. "She was beautiful, aloof, radiant," he recounted. "She walked through the world as if it was a story she was only half aware of."

When Yasara had sworn an oath of eternal love to her dance partner—an oath she clearly never intended to keep—the satyr had intervened. "I was arrogant," he admitted. "I wanted to prove that I could twist fate myself. Who wouldn't? A gambler who can change reality with stories... Come on! Isn't that the best thing you could tell of yourself?"

His eyes gleamed with remembered pride. "And I, to be brutally honest, I did it. I told a tale so compelling and strong that reality shifted around it, and her oath was undone." He paused, his momentary triumph fading. "And I could never lie again. Damn it, why did I waste my time with that stupid lady?"

"What are you looking forward to?" Wellby asked, changing the subject.

"The next cup of wine," the satyr responded flatly. "I don't know. Nothing really. Getting out of here." He explained that supposedly, one selfless act would end his curse. "But I tried that. Letting a mortal win at cards didn't work. Plus, it was tough anyway because everybody beats me at cards. Can't bluff, can't cheat, can't lie. Damn! I used to be such a good gambler."

The satyr continued, listing his failed attempts at selflessness—giving someone wine, trying to offer sincere compliments without following with criticism. "I don't want to leave because I'm afraid to wander around the Feywild in my current state. I don't really want to stay because everybody's sick of me telling the truth about them."

Wellby, recalling his mission, redirected the conversation. "I heard there's some refugee from Amberglow here."

"Oh, the broken mask!" The satyr perked up slightly. "He's a sad sack."
"Where is that dude?" Wellby pressed.

"He's always got his wherever the strongest wine is. That's where you'll find him." The satyr waved dismissively. "Don't bother talking to him. All he does is bemoan his fate."
"Is that not what you're doing this whole time?" Wellby countered with a knowing smile.
"It is what I'm doing, but—" The satyr began.
"If you had to be brutally honest?" Wellby's eyes twinkled.
"I can't even say I'm being interesting about it, because I know that I'm not. Damn it!" The satyr exclaimed, a reluctant laugh escaping him.
Changing tactics, Wellby asked, "What's gonna happen here when Harrow and Wend roll through?"
"We'll all die," came the blunt response.
"Why not prepare for that? Why not do something about that now?" Wellby challenged. "Why just let that happen?"
The satyr shook his head. "These are questions that I cannot answer, because what do I know of the doings of fey lords? The whole neighborhood went to hell when Cloud Spinner vanished."
"I mean—" Wellby began.
"If I'm being brutally honest, really, we just need her back," the satyr interrupted. "But that's never gonna happen."
Wellby noticed Kenzo subtly touching his necklace, where Cloud Spinner was imprisoned. "One of the things I want to do is go back through her old realm," Wellby said carefully. "Who here knows the ways around there? Who can guide me in and through?"
"You think that would count as a selfless act?" The satyr raised an eyebrow, interested for the first time.
"Worth a shot," Wellby affirmed. "Do you know the terrain there?"
"If I'm being brutally honest, I've never been to Amberglow specifically," the satyr admitted.
Their conversation turned to the Shrouded Archive, where all the Feywild's secrets were kept. "I bet I could find that," the satyr claimed.
"Really, if you're being brutally honest?" Wellby pressed.
"The trick is not so much finding it. It's figuring out how to pay the tax," the satyr explained.
"The tax?"
"I don't really know for sure. Everybody just says, you know, whines and complains about the toll I had to pay for X, Y, and Z." He frowned in concentration. "Nobody can ever say what they have to give up. It's like they can't tell what the payment was."
As their conversation continued, the satyr lamented his boring existence. "Most stories are only good because they're embellished," he explained with weary honesty. "Around here, not that many stories are good told straight. Most people don't actually lead very interesting lives since you mortals stopped coming through."
Seeing an opportunity, Wellby leaned forward. "Want to hear an interesting story that's all true?"
The satyr's eyes lit up with genuine interest. "I do."
And so Wellby began the tale of how they had stopped an emperor from becoming a god—a story remarkable enough that even without embellishment, it promised to captivate a truth-bound satyr starved for genuine entertainment.

%% LONG VERSION

## Narrative
Our session begins in Emberwine, as the party follows [[Auntie Mulberry]]'s enchanting flute melody toward Sunwine Hall. Lady Eventide, speaking through Seeker's possessed form, reminisces about Lord Sovin as they approached the massive open-air pavilion where golden afternoon light catches hanging vines heavy with fruit, and music echoed strangely through the surrounding grove.

Curious eyes turned their way as they joined the celebration, with an elegantly dressed man welcoming these unusual mortal visitors. Wellby, using his talent for adapting to unfamiliar social settings, led them through the flow of the festivities while Kenzo sensed an undercurrent beneath the revelry—these celebrations seemed partly intended to help people avoid thinking about troubling matters elsewhere.

Their presence eventually drew the attention of Lord Sovin himself, a seven-foot-tall figure with antlers adorned with vines and red ribbons, from whom a faint melody emanated, who invited Delwath to dance with him and speak. When Delwath mentioned Cloudspinner's imprisonment during their dance, Lord Sovin faltered, a discordant note breaking his melody. Learning they had actually found Cloudspinner visibly shocked him: "None of us ever thought the Cloud Spinner could return," he admitted. As the dance and conservation ends, the party splits up to mingle and seek information as best they can. 

Kenzo drifted away from his companions toward the periphery of the endless celebration, finding a quieter spot near one of the smaller musical ensembles that dotted the edges of Sunwine Hall. Settling into a meditative posture, he reached out with his spiritual awareness to commune with the natural world around him—something he had never attempted in the Feywild before. Instead of the familiar whispers of plants and animals he typically sensed in the material world, Kenzo was overwhelmed by a riot of emotion pouring from every vine and fruit. The vegetation itself seemed alive with pleasure and sweetness, their feelings shifting and responding to the moods of the revelers like a vast, silent orchestra. His senses filled with the phantom taste of ripe peach and sun-warmed fruit, while further out he detected notes of overripeness—not corrupt, but strained, as though the land itself was trying too hard to maintain this perpetual celebration. 

While Kenzo communed with the strange nature of Emberwine, Wellby wandered through the festivities with a keen eye for anyone who might not belong. His attention was drawn to a satyr sitting alone—lean and rakish with curling ram's horns wrapped in gold rings, a half-buttoned silk shirt, and a fiddle under his arm. The satyr's pouting expression stood out in stark contrast to the jubilant atmosphere, prompting Wellby to approach and introduce himself.

"Damn! Why do you have to ask that?" the satyr responded when questioned about his solitude. He explained his curse with bitter humor—condemned to speak only brutal, unfiltered truth. The curse had come after he had used his storytelling talents to help a fey woman named Yasara the Golden escape an oath she shouldn't have made, an act he admitted was driven by arrogance rather than altruism. "I told a tale so compelling and strong that reality shifted around it, and her oath was undone. And I could never lie again," he lamented. When Wellby inquired about the refugee from Amberglow, the satyr called him "the broken mask" and directed Wellby to wherever the strongest wine was served. Their conversation turned to deeper matters—the deterioration of the Feywild after Cloud Spinner's disappearance, the mysterious Shrouded Archive where all secrets were kept (accessible only by paying an unnamed "tax"), and the satyr's dreary existence, unable to participate in the normal social fabric of fey life. "Do you know how many stories are only good because they're embellished? Like, all of them," he said with weary honesty. His interest finally piqued when Wellby offered to share a true story about stopping an emperor from becoming a god—a tale that promised to be entertaining even without embellishment.

Delwath made his way through the endless celebration, his warrior's bearing drawing curious glances from the revelers. It wasn't long before he caught the attention of a boisterous fey man with a weathered, handsome face and a ruddy glow to his cheeks. The man wore a dented but polished breastplate, a cloak stained with wine, and carried a slender silver sword at his side. With the casual confidence of one accustomed to being the center of attention, the golden-haired warrior approached Delwath, throwing an arm around his shoulders.

"You've been telling stories," he declared, raising his glass. "A toast to your tales!" Taking another step, he added, "I guess you've been looking for me. A toast to new friends!" As they spoke, Delwath learned this was Arendel, a renowned duelist who prided himself on facing countless opponents at Lord Sovin's court. When their conversation turned to combat, Arendel's eyes lit up with enthusiasm. "The best duels are between friends," he insisted, drawing his shimmering blade and challenging Delwath on the spot. They quickly established terms—a duel to first blood with minimal magic allowed, the loser obligated to entertain the winner with stories for one day. With a dramatic flourish, Arendel banged his sword against his cup, announcing their contest to the gathering. "A duel, a duel! Arendel's gonna fight!" The excitement rippled through the party like a wave, revelers turning toward the unexpected entertainment with eager anticipation.

While her companions explored other aspects of the endless revel, Riswynn wandered through the celebration seeking travelers who might have useful information. Her attention was drawn to a tall woman standing slightly apart from the festivities—Ismara of Gleamwater, with her silvery hair and light brown skin, elegant in dress but notably carrying a satchel filled with ink pens, files, and books. Intrigued by this unusual sight, Riswynn approached her with a greeting. Ismara responded with immediate interest: "A novelty! A dwarf in Emberwine, unheard of!" She opened her book eagerly, fingers dancing across the pages as Riswynn spoke of their journey through the desert, the mystical tree portal, and their flying castle. Each revelation seemed to delight Ismara further as she recorded these details in her book. "Anyone with curiosity is a scholar in my book," she declared warmly when Riswynn mentioned her interest in learning about the Feywild.

Their conversation was interrupted by excited shouts—"A duel! Arendel is going to fight!"—drawing everyone's attention to the center of the gathering. As they made their way to watch, Valeris informed Wellby that Arendel "never loses, almost." The fey duelist and Delwath faced each other with formal ceremony, touching blades as Arendel reminded his opponent they could each use one spell. Delwath invoked divine guidance while Arendel employed Shield to deflect incoming strikes. The combat unfolded in a flurry of attacks—Arendel's blade finding its mark with precise strikes, Delwath responding with powerful blows that made the fey warrior stagger back. "A talented fighter," Arendel acknowledged as the duel progressed, clearly enjoying the challenge. Though Delwath fought valiantly, landing devastating hits that brought him close to victory, a string of unfortunate misses in the final exchanges sealed his fate. Arendel emerged victorious, but with visible respect for his opponent, raising his glass: "I have not been so close to defeat in many a day. Everybody give a round of applause to Delwath!" The crowd cheered as Arendel looked forward to the stories he'd won, offering a final toast "to travelers" and, with a touch of humor, "to annoying satyrs" like Valeris, who received a comforting squeeze on the shoulder from Wellby.

The crowd around Delwath and Arendel swelled with excitement following their duel, the fey revelers eager to hear tales from the mortal warrior who had matched their champion. "Now come, let us sit and let me hear your tales," Arendel declared, gesturing broadly to the gathered crowd. "I'm sure that many in the court would appreciate the stories of such a well-traveled mortal as yourself, who carries such a wonderful blade." Seizing the opportunity, Delwath began with the tale of how he acquired his ancient elven sword, moving on to recount the party's encounters with fearsome dragons. The fey listeners were particularly captivated by these dragon-slaying exploits, their eyes wide with wonder at descriptions of battles against creatures that were rare even in their magical realm.

After a time, Arendel excused himself to seek refreshment, promising to return soon for more tales of adventure. In his absence, the companions gathered together with Valeris the truth-cursed satyr and Ismara of Gleamwater still lingering nearby. Riswynn approached Ismara to inquire about Everlight's Bloom and the possibility of finding information about Amberglow. "The Shrouded Archive! Tricky place!" Ismara cautioned, her fingers dancing across the pages of her magical book. "Always a little cautious of places where nobody can ever tell you what they gave up to get information." With graceful gestures, she conjured shimmering images above her book's pages: first the magnificent Cloud Palace with its six towers rising from a massive cloud, then the glowing red castle of Red Sun Keep standing before the crystallized wall of swirling sunset colors, followed by visions of amber lights that carried Cloud Spinner's stories throughout the realm. She spoke of Heartwood Grove, now dark and rotting after its guardian was slain, and the northern outposts overtaken by the mysterious Gloom Shaper. When questioned about Redsun Watch's location, Ismara explained it could be found by following the Sunset Gate northward.

The companions gathered in a quiet corner of the endless revel, sorting through what they had learned and planning their next move. The party decided to recruit Ismara and Valeris as guides, if they could, and speak to the refugee from Amberglow, the Broken Mask, before departing. 

Ismara approached with evident fascination. "I am pleased to have heard some of your stories," she said, indicating her desire to remain while Delwath fulfilled his obligation to Arendel. Her fingers traced patterns over her book as she spoke of her passion for collecting tales of the mortal realm. "What a strange place it must be," she mused, "to have so little control over the world. Have it control you." When questioned about her own travels, Ismara revealed plans to journey as far as the Sunset Gate but no further, citing the dangers that had grown since Cloud Spinner's disappearance—the spreading Dusk Mire, the aggression of Harrow and Wend, and the difficulties of reaching Twilight's Grace. Meanwhile, Wellby sought out Valeris, formally inviting the truth-cursed satyr to join their quest. "Why don't you come with us to find the archive? You can find out what you have to give up to get in," he proposed. The satyr agreed to guide them but planned to remain outside the archive itself. "Maybe if I pay careful enough attention to how you are like before you go in and what you're like when you come out, I can figure out what's changed," he reasoned, hoping this act might finally qualify as the selfless deed needed to break his curse. With a mix of annoyed affection, he added, "I kind of find you annoying, but also charming," to which Wellby replied with a smile, "I find you at least one of those."

The companions found Count Vashen exactly where he'd been described—slumped against a column at the edge of the festivities, crushing grapes in his hand and flicking the remains into the gathering. Unlike the vibrant, distinctive fey all around them, Vashen was remarkably unremarkable, his features almost deliberately forgettable, as if designed to be overlooked. His once-elegant clothes were stained and neglected, a spilled wine glass at his side. When Delwath addressed him by name, he flicked a grape in their direction. "Go by the broken mask now," he muttered, his voice dull. "What do you want?"

The conversation shifted dramatically when Delwath boldly declared, "You've given up too soon. The Cloud Spinner's alive." Though Vashen initially scoffed, his interest visibly grew as they described the amber lights and their encounters at the Guardian of the Red Key. Lady Eventide, still possessing Seeker, pulled Wellby aside and whispered urgently—she recognized Vashen as one of Cloud Spinner's most trusted servants, the Warden of Cloud Palace, someone she had assumed perished long ago. When Kenzo observed how many fey at the revels seemed unable to recall their pasts, the party suspected the Fey wine might be clouding Vashen's memories. With a determined look, Kenzo reached out, channeling his ki to temporarily suppress the deep Fey magic afflicting Vashen's mind.

The effect was immediate—Vashen's eyes cleared, then filled with tears and anger. "What did you do?" he demanded, his entire demeanor changing. Through Delwath's detect thoughts spell, they glimpsed the truth: Vashen had betrayed Cloud Spinner, bringing Shamat to Cloud Palace during a moment of vulnerability. Paralyzed by fear, he had fled as the two powerful beings clashed, watching as Cloud Spinner fell and the palace began to crash. When Wellby revealed the imprisoned Cloud Spinner within his necklace, Vashen slumped in recognition. Though clearly ashamed, he offered what help he could—each of Cloud Spinner's keeps along the Sunset Gate contained a hidden connection to the Prism Well that could only be seen by sunset light. "If any of the keeps on the eastern border fell, they could use this to summon her power from the Prism Well itself," he explained, his voice growing fainter as Kenzo's cleansing touch began to fade. "There's always a price to pay," he warned as his memories slipped away once more, his face slowly regaining the vacant expression they had first encountered, lost again to the blissful forgetfulness of Emberwine

The companions huddled in a secluded corner of the endless revel, weighing their options with careful deliberation. Delwath outlined two possible paths: the direct route north to the Sunset Gate and its keeps, or the more mysterious journey to the Shrouded Archive where all secrets were kept—at an unknown price. "The Sunset Gate is practical," Wellby argued, voicing the growing consensus. Their planning grew more detailed as they considered logistics: Delwath would fulfill his storytelling debt to Arendel while requesting mounts from Lord Sovin, and Wellby excitedly proposed training the wyvern they had trapped in their mirror, much to Kenzo's amused interest. The final piece fell into place when Kenzo's soul sight revealed Ismara to be a genuine scholar rather than a spy, allowing them to confidently decide to invite both her and Valeris along, curious to see which fey would choose to accompany them on their quest to restore Cloud Spinner to her rightful place.

Over the next two days at the endless revel, the party learned that the memory-dulling effect of Fey wine required overindulgence over time rather than causing immediate forgetfulness. Their preparations for departure took shape as they secured traveling companions and mounts. Ismara of Gleamwater agreed to accompany them to the Sunset Gate, though she expressed hesitation about continuing northward: "I'm not likely to be of much use against the minions of Harrowin Wind." Meanwhile, Lord Sovin granted them beautiful, ornate griffins for their journey—not the traditional eagle-lion hybrids but magnificent creatures with peacock-like plumage in vibrant reds, golds, and greens, with spotted fur reminiscent of leopards or tigers. "I can provide mounts to carry you to the borders of my realms," he offered. "Whether they take you beyond is up to you to convince them."

The most spectacular preparation came when Wellby attempted to tame the Wyvern trapped in their mirror. In a secluded area outside the revels, the halfling bard coaxed the massive creature from its magical prison. Standing just 3.5 feet tall before the 15-foot dragon-like beast with its poisonous stinger tail and 20-foot wingspan, Wellby employed a careful strategy of food, wine, and his remarkable animal handling skills. Through patient work and animal telepathy, he gradually calmed the creature enough to approach. The gathered fey watched in astonishment as the tiny halfling mounted the massive beast, staying aboard despite its initial bucking and resistance. Kenzo, initially there merely to witness the spectacle, couldn't resist joining the adventure when Wellby called him up. "Wyvern Kenzo, Kenzo Wyvern," Wellby introduced them formally as the monk gracefully flipped onto the creature's back. When they took flight together, soaring above Sunwine Hall in what was likely the first tamed Wyvern flight ever seen in Emberwine, Kenzo asked with a laugh, "Why didn't you do this earlier?"

The Satyr Valeris agreed to join their expedition with wry enthusiasm: "Anything to get out of here. Just don't let me die, please." When questioned about the mortality rate of their companions, the party optimistically described it as "single-digit numbers," prompting Wellby to quip, "You think of death in such a binary way." As their departure day arrived, the seven travelers gathered outside Sunwine Hall—two fey allies accompanying five adventurers. Wellby and Kenzo mounted their partially-tamed Wyvern while Riswynn, Seeker, Delwath, Valeris, and Ismara each settled onto their brilliantly colored griffins. With a final story from Delwath about Wellby's Wyvern-taming exploits fresh in the minds of the revelers, the session ended as the unusual procession launched into the sky, leaving the perpetual celebration of Emberwine behind as they set course for the mysteries of the Sunset Gate and the ruins of Amber Glow beyond.
