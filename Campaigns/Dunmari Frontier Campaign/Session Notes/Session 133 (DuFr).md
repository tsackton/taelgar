## Narrative

Our session begins in the valley of the Heartroot, where the Dunmar Fellowship braces for imminent attack by the Empress of Chaos. Kenzo knelt to attune himself to the Heartroot's energy, binding his power to its power, while Wellby summoned the stone triceratops, Delwath prepared to launch blasts of eldritch force, and Seeker Wished a Forcecage into existence, surrounded and protecting both himself and the Heartroot. The Empress of Chaos came skimming across the treetops at speed, armor rippling like liquid metal, summoning three whirling chaos storms ahead of her as she approached. Wellby's Arrow of Seeking struck true, blinding her for a breath, but she never veered from her course to the Heartroot itself. 

The battle was fully joined as the Empress reached the Heartroot, taking Eldritch Blasts and a psychic assault on the way, then hung over the cage and flung bands of metal that pinned Wellby and Delwath in place. She dropped beside Seeker 5; Delwath threaded blasts through the cage’s slits, but her spear answered with a thunderous, lightning-laced strike that staggered the simulacrum. Kenzo, dodging, slid to the cage’s edge, and hammered her with staff and fist. Seeker 5 tried to transfigure her; she broke it by will alone, shedding plates of armor and briefly dulling her arcane surety.

The Empress of Chaos stared Seeker 5 down, guessing he was the source of the Forcecage protecting the Heartroot, and attacked. Her burning sword struck hard, and then the chaos spear brimming with lightning energy shattered Seeker 5 into melting ice. She then turned on Kenzo. He twisted, a green ward absorbing the shock as he deflected the blow and stood unscathed. Wellby’s shot found her; in riposte, the Empress drove her spear again, this time slipping through Kenzo’s guard. Even blunted by his training, the hit staggered him, but, with his connection to the Heartroot, he responded by calling a nearby tree to attack. The bonded tree unfurled a mandela of branches that scythed at the Empress, catching her as she failed to slip free.

Seeker loosed a catapult, sending a dense stone from afar to crack into the Empress of Chaos. Nearby, the Heroic Ladder and the Tricertops held the line against the chaos storms, even as the flailing aura of whipping rocks bit into them. Borrowing the Ladder’s burst of speed, Delwath closed through the edge of the aura and drove the Empress prone with heavy steel and radiant force, then let the divine storm around him flicker out to wreathe his blade in a smite for the next strike. His final swing missed. Her armor flared, catapulting her skyward without offering a blade’s opening; Wellby slipped clear on instinct as she rose ninety feet.

Kenzo surged up after her, and hammered home three clean strikes that left the Empress bloodied. Below, the metallic storms thickened with stone and fell upon the Triceratops, six wind-talons raking it until the beast staggered, badly hurt. The Empress answered with a surge of jagged metal; Wellby forced through it, but coils cinched around Kenzo midair, halting him in place until his next breath, hovering and bound.

The triceratops thundered into the nearest storm-beast, its horns smashing through the gale. Above, the Empress of Chaos drifted to ninety feet, baited a swing from Kenzo’s reaching weapon, then turned on him. Cold poured from her sword and a spear followed, divine power raking through him, much of it blunted by his stubborn resilience. Wellby’s lightning arrow cracked against her and he shattered one of the chaos storms into scree; he shook off a blinding curse and jabbed at Kenzo again in the gaps between their movements. Seeker’s healing word reached him, and a cutting mockery spoiled her next strike. Delwath bent space with Scatter, whistled into the air, and reached her at height; one smiting blow landed, the rest slid off. She answered with another chill cut. With her brief flurries spent, Kenzo struck twice with his staff; her armor shimmered oily under the blows. Then he disengaged and streaked for the cliffs, outpacing her by a breath. The Empress hung bloodied and furious over the force cage, storms dwindling.

The metallic storms tore into the Triceratops with raking wind-talons until the beast cracked and collapsed into a small stone figurine, dormant again for a time. Meanwhile, the Empress turned on Delwath; twin sword-cuts bit deep, fire and cold riding the steel, while a spear-thrust was turned aside by Yezali's protection. Wellby’s shot failed to blind her but she still staggered from the blow, her resiliance beginning to fail. Seeker mended Delwath with ringing words and hexed the Empress’s focus, and even the ladder slammed her once. Sensing the Heartroot within Kenzo, the Empress knifed through the air toward him.

Delwath streaked across the valley to shield Kenzo, summoning the Sanctuary of the Tanshi to protect him; Kenzo, continued to flee, Delwath in tow, hoping to draw the Empress away from the Heartroot. The Empress simply ran them down. Her first blade slid off the ward; the second punched through and felled Kenzo. Then she drove the Chaos Spear into his fallen form, forcing the blessing and spilling cold that ripped into Delwath, as the storms closed on Wellby and Kenzo began to bleed out.

Shredded by the metallic storms, Wellby steadied himself and loosed two shots, the first biting deep enough to draw fear to her eyes. Seeker, out of conventional reach, bent his Catapult through the distance, seizing a far-off stone and driving it in a long, tearing line through the trees to crash into her. She staggered on last legs. Nearby, the animated Ladder pushed into the slicing gale, weathered the cuts, and hammered at the storm menacing Wellby. Between heartbeats, she struck at Kenzo, and his life ebbed further. With no time for mercy, Delwath closed and landed a solid blow, lacing it with radiant force that seared her but did not drop her. 

Delwath’s final stroke felled the Empress of Chaos, and her armor burst apart, swelling into a twenty-foot whirlwind of formless metal. Limbo’s energies tore her to shreds as a screaming face fluttered and vanished within the storm. The Elemental Cataclysm heaved itself toward the Heartroot. Delwath shifted his mark to it, lanced it with force and steel, then spared a swift prayer to pull Kenzo back from the brink. Metallic Storms raked Wellby; he cut one down and drove arrows into the maelstrom until it bled metal, a spear beginning to form at its core. The cataclysm flared fire inside Seeker’s cage, breaking his focus and setting him ablaze.

Kenzo rose, uncorked a potion of Dragon’s Majesty, and exploded from the trees as a silver dragon veined with heartwood light. His paralyzing breath washed uselessly over the storm, but a rending claw tore loose a cascade of shards. He chased hard and tried to bind it; twice the chaos threw off the magic, though that defiance felt finite. The ladder smashed another Metallic Storm and moved to support. The cataclysm dashed for the Heartroot; Delwath tore space to bar its path and carved deep. The Heartroot answered, earthen loam smothering Seeker’s flames. Bloodied and spear-armed, the whirlwind bore down as they braced between it and the tree.

Kenzo the silver dragon pressed the assault against a swirling mass of metal bent on piercing the Heartroot. The thing shrugged off transmutation and cold, so Kenzo raked it apart with relentless claws while Delwath drove hard blows and Wellby’s arrows bit at seams. When it landed atop the Heartroot and began shaping a spear to bore through, Kenzo crashed down, tore the thing open, and settled over the Heartroot, wings mantled to shield it as ash and metal fell. A warm pulse from the Heartroot washed over them.

Our session ends as the party mounted on the back of the silver dragon -- Kenzo, still transformed -- and raced to the battlefield where the defenders of Aurbez still faced the hobgoblin horde. Kenzo’s freezing breath blew a hole through the hobgoblin line; rangers, lizardfolk, Aurbeze militias, the remaining hippos, and Vindristjarna with Faldrak and Hektor pressed the opening. Over the next half hour the enemy broke and fled. In the quiet that followed, Kenzo—silver scales threaded with moss and green—carried them on a victorious circuit before returning to stand watch over the Heartroot.
