After securing Aurbez, visions and communion revealed that a widening gash at Izengay is spilling Limbo into the Isteros and must be sealed from within, so the company prepared in Tolin to enter Limbo and, once the river is cleansed, return the Heartroot to its home.

## Session Info
### Summary
- Orbez is secured after victory at Heartroot Vale as hobgoblin lines break under the stoneborn counterstrike and Kenzo the silver dragon.
- The Mirror of the Past reveals the Heartroot’s birth along the Isteros, its reverent removal during Isengen’s fall, and its long confinement in the vale.
- Communion with the Heartroot confirms it can truly grow only at the center of the upper Isteros Valley once the river’s Limbo-taint is cleansed.
- Catalan Malra’s rite to Beryl grants a vision that the blight springs from a planar wound at Izengay, not a portal.
- The vision shows Rye and monks of the Awakened Soul attempting closure from this side, vanishing as threads snap and Rye’s hand shatters into five.
- The company resolves to seal the gash from within Limbo, then remediate the Isteros and bear the Heartroot back to its source.
- Weeks in Tolin secure guidance, protections, and trades with the Philosopher’s Guild—including Dust of Glibness and a Frostbrand greatsword—while Contact Other Plane confirms Rye and some monks still live.
## Narrative

After the Battle of the Heartroot Vale, the tide turned with Kenzo the silver dragon. Lizardfolk, hippopotamuses, rangers, and archers held; the hobgoblin lines broke, and the stoneborn army from the south delivered the final blow. Losses were real but lighter than feared; fugitives scattered, and Orbez was safe for now. Around the evening fires, thanks and food circulated. Delwath checked on the wounded; Seeker tended the heroic ladder; Wellby gathered Orbez’s stories—refugees from Isingue, ash storms and ash elementals in the War of the Ashen Horde, a ranger-forged alliance, and the Heartroot kept secret.

Night drew them to the Heartroot. The root-ball unfurled, blue-white filaments pulsing like a slow heartbeat, air smelling of yeast and rain; it strained against the wrong-shaped stream. They raised the Mirror of the Past and sought its home. A first-light rift birthed the Isteros; a vast symbiotic web spread along its banks; Isengen flourished—until siege, red mist, and a fragment lifted with reverence and carried here. Years blurred to Rye, jade-clad, in this valley, conferring of monks, Dimitar’s vigil, sealing a portal to Limbo opened by Cha'mutte’s death, and hobgoblin danger to the last Heartroot relic. The vision faded, leaving longing and a path.

Kenzo settled with the heartroot and listened. After the vision, the connection was unmistakable: the heartroot was, in some deep way, part of the river Istheros. It could endure here, but not grow—only at the center of the upper Istheros Valley, where it had been made. It ached to rejoin the river, yet the Istheros ran foul, tainted by ooze spilling from a rent to Limbo. Reconnection was simple in principle and impossible in practice until the breach was sealed and the waters cleansed.

The company took stock. They carried a wand that could slice between planes and another that could find portals, but closing Limbo was another craft. They chose to seek answers: consult the Philosopher’s Guild, search the Bastion’s resources, and petition Beryl through his clergy—perhaps the Priestess of Beryl, Catalan Malra. If needed, they would question the stoneborn metaphysicist Yandallo with Speak with Dead. Their course was set: locate and seal the Limbo portal, remediate the Istheros, then bear the heartroot to the valley’s center. Until then, the relic would only survive, and the valley would remain blighted.

They returned to camp and found Malra outside her tent, finishing a thanksgiving to the stars, to Beryl. The Ranger bowed and offered aid. At their request to learn of the Fox and the Hunter and the Green Man, she spoke of an old tale: the Green Man teleported to the veil, conferred at length with the Fox and the Hunter, and departed on a quest from which he never returned. She knelt, lit incense, and tapped her ring against stones until the rhythm and smoke drew them into a trance beneath the rising constellation.

Flashes came: the remembered parley, then a surge of grief and dread—failure, not a portal but a plane spilling over. They saw Rye on a dusty plain by the Isteros River with Isengay behind; monks of the awakened order of the Awakened Soul chanted power into him. He reached for unseen threads, pulled, something snapped; Rye and the monks vanished, and his hand shattered into five pieces that flew apart. A sense followed: Limbo had been pouring into the Plaguelands as a cracked barrier worsened, fed in recent months by fractures in Apollyon’s prison of Limbo. The wound dated to Cha'mutte’s death. Asked what would heal it, the answer was clear: not closing a portal, but going to Limbo and pulling it all back.

They surfaced from Beryl’s vision with a clear diagnosis: at Izengay, Cha'mutte’s death had torn a gash between the Material and Limbo, not a portal, and the waxing spillover had long explained tales like frozen sunlight from Sembaran lore. When Apollyon’s binding unraveled, that gathered power flooded the wound, widening the chaos around Izengay. Closing it from this side had failed for Rye and the monks; to heal it, they would have to enter Limbo and seal the tear there.

Urgency met caution. They had the means to reach Limbo—Plane Shift via the Chaos Medal and a wand—but chose to prepare in Tolin. They would mine their own libraries, hall, observatory, and archives, and bargain with the Philosopher’s Guild—offering a Dust of Glibness and a Frostbrand greatsword—for guidance on surviving Limbo and on sealing a limbo wound, with further study on cleansing the tainted lands after. Through Contact Other Plane, the Taunti confirmed that geometry in Limbo was uncertain, survival without special wards was possible, native peoples were unknown, and Rye and some monks still lived and remained sane. The plan set: stage in Tolin, then into Limbo to find the far side of the wound and force it shut before the chaos swamped the world.

## Detailed Summary

### Campfires and the Heartroot's Past

- Defenders of Orbez turned the battle at Heartroot Vale, aided by Kenzo and a silver dragon ally, and broke the hobgoblin lines as the stoneborn army sealed the victory from the south.
- Campfires filled the sheltered valley as the companions accepted thanks; Delwath checked in across the camps, Seeker tended his beard and heroic ladder, and Wellby gathered Orbez’s stories.
- The party approached the Heartroot at night and saw bioluminescent pulses and spreading roots that strained to grow but were constrained by the stream’s wrong shape.
- Kenzo raised the Mirror of the Past to ask the Heartroot about its home, and the vision showed its birth at the Reeving as the Isteros split the land and a mycorrhizal life spread along the river.
- The vision showed Isengen’s fertile ribbon flourishing before a hobgoblin siege and red mist, a fragment of the Heartroot being reverently uprooted and brought to this valley, and long years of confinement beneath a narrow sky.
- The mirror finally revealed the jade wizard Rai standing here speaking with Beryl about plague relics, Dimitar guarding a prison, and closing a Limbo portal opened by Cha'mutte’s death before hobgoblins found the last Heartroot relic.

### Heartroot's Return to Istheros

- Kenzo communed with the heartroot and learned it was part of the river Istheros and could grow only at the center of the upper Istheros Valley.
- The heartroot expressed eagerness to rejoin the river but revealed the waters were fouled by a portal to Limbo.
- The party set a plan to close the Limbo portal, cleanse the Istheros, and then return the heartroot to its home.
- They considered using a plane-slicing wand and a portal-finding wand to locate and seal the rift.
- They chose to seek guidance from the Philosopher's Guild and from Beryl's priesthood, including the Priestess Catalan Malra.
- They recalled Beryl had sacrificed himself to kill Cha'mutte.

### Vision of the Limbo Wound

- The party returned to camp and found Cuddle in Malra, Ranger devotee of the Fox and Hunter, in prayer to Beryl.
- Malra recalled that the Green Man once spoke with the Fox and the Hunter before the War of the Ashen Horde and vanished on a quest.
- Malra led an incense prayer to Beryl beneath the rising Fox and the Hunter, opening a shared vision.
- Beryl revealed the calamity was a planar wound rather than a portal, a vortex of Limbo spilling into Isengay.
- The vision showed Rye on the Isteros River before Isengay with monks of the Awakened Soul, attempting to close it and vanishing as his hand shattered into five.
- Beryl conveyed that cracks in Apollyon’s Limbo‑wrought prison had swelled the Plaguelands since Cha'mutte’s death, and that the remedy lay in traveling to Limbo to pull the plane back.

### Toward the Limbo Gash

- Beryl’s vision revealed the Izengay wound as a chaotic gash to Limbo born of Cha’mutte’s death and swelled by Apollyon’s unraveling.
- The party resolved to enter Limbo to close the gash from that side and later clean up the spillover in the material world.
- The Taunti answered that Limbo’s geometry was uncertain, survival there was possible without protection, natives were unknown, and Rye and some monks still lived and were sane.
- The company planned to seek the Philosopher’s Guild in Tolin, trading Dust of Glibness and a Frostbrand greatsword for guidance on healing the wound and surviving Limbo.
- Preparations included using their Bastion’s archives and observatory to research Limbo and Contact Other Plane to question Rye.
- The group confirmed they could Plane Shift to Limbo using the Chaos Medal as a focus.
