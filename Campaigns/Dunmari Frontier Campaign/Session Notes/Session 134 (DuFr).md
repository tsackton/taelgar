## Narrative

Our session begins as the party is victorious in the [[Battle of Heartroot Vale]]. Kenzo, transformed into a silver dragon, leads the charge against the hobgoblin lines; the combined forces of the lizardfolk, rangers, and Aurbeze militias push the attack, breaking the lines of the hobgoblin army. Even the hobgoblin's retreat is foiled, as the arriving stoneborn army crushed the few hobgoblins who escaped the dragon. While the Aurbeze defenders suffered real losses, they were less than feared, and with the remnants of the [[Iron Fang]] scattered and fleaing, the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] was safe. Around the evening fires, thanks and food circulated. [[Delwath]] checked on the wounded; [[Seeker]] tended the heroic ladder; [[Wellby]] gathered stories— of refugees from [[Isingue]], ash storms and ash elementals in the [[War of the Ashen Horde]], a ranger-forged alliance, and the [[Heartroot]] kept secret.

As night fell, [[Kenzo]] led the group to the [[Heartroot]] itself, drawn by its pull. The root-ball unfurled, blue-white filaments pulsing like a slow heartbeat, air smelling of yeast and rain; it strained against the wrong-shaped stream. They raised the Mirror of the Past and sought its home, seeing the [[Heartroot Vision]]. Kenzo settled with the [[Heartroot]] and listened. After the vision, the connection was unmistakable: the [[Heartroot]] was, in some deep way, part of the river [[Istaros]]. It could endure here, survive for a time, but not grow. Only at the center of the [[Istaros]] valley where it had first come into being could it thrive. It ached to rejoin the river, yet the [[Istaros]] ran foul, tainted by a titanic ooze and the chaos spilling from the wound to [[Limbo]]. Reconnection was simple in principle and impossible in practice until the breach was sealed and the waters cleansed.

The company took stock. They carried a wand that could slice between planes and another that could find portals, but closing the wound to Limbo was another craft. They chose to seek answers: consult the [[Ancient and Honorable Guild of Philosophers|Philosopher's Guild]], search [[Vindristjarna]]'s libraries and the loremasters of [[Tollen]], and speak to the [[Fox and Hunter]]. 

Returning to camp, the party sought [[Cateline Malras]] to aid in speaking with the [[Fox and Hunter]]. They found her outside her tent, finishing a thanksgiving prayers to the stars, to the [[Fox and Hunter]]. The [[The Rangers|Ranger]] bowed and offered aid. She told them of a story, a legend from a generation ago, when [[Rai|a wizard in the form of a statue of jade]] came to speak with [[Beryl|the stars in the Heartroot Vale]], then departed on a quest and never returned. She knelt, lit incense, and tapped her ring against stones until the rhythm and smoke drew them into a trance beneath the rising constellation.

Flashes and visions came. The remembered parley, searching for a way to close what was believed to be a portal to [[Limbo]], opened by [[Cha'mutte]]. A plan, aided by the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]], to cleanse the chaos energy from the [[Istaros]], to close the portal. Then, the stars watching and a  a surge of grief and dread: failure, for this was no simple portal but a wound, a gash in the [[Multiverse]] through which [[Limbo]] spilled.  [[Rai]], on a dusty plain by the [[Istaros]] near [[Isingue]]; monks of the [[Order of the Awakened Soul]] chanting power into him. He reached for unseen threads, pulled, something snapped; [[Rai]] and the monks vanished, and his hand shattered into five pieces that flew apart. Then, a warning and a plea. The tidal surges of Limbo had been growing worse these past months, fed by the untying of the knots that Cha'mutte had used to bind Apollyon's prison. To heal it, the vision said, would require not closing a portal, but going to Limbo and pulling it all back.

As the party returned to their camp to discuss, urgency met caution. They had the means to reach Limbo, for the [[Chaos Metal]] served as a planar connection point allowing spells to pull them across. But they wisely decided to prepare first, planning to travel to [[Tollen]] to learn what they could of [[Limbo]] before venturing there. Our session ends as the party takes a well-deserved rest, with plans to journey to [[Tollen]] in the morning.

## Detailed Summary

### Campfires and the Heartroot's Past

- Defenders of Orbez turned the battle at Heartroot Vale, aided by Kenzo and a silver dragon ally, and broke the hobgoblin lines as the stoneborn army sealed the victory from the south.
- Campfires filled the sheltered valley as the companions accepted thanks; Delwath checked in across the camps, Seeker tended his beard and heroic ladder, and Wellby gathered Orbez’s stories.
- The party approached the Heartroot at night and saw bioluminescent pulses and spreading roots that strained to grow but were constrained by the stream’s wrong shape.
- Kenzo raised the Mirror of the Past to ask the Heartroot about its home, and the vision showed its birth at the Reeving as the Isteros split the land and a mycorrhizal life spread along the river.
- The vision showed Isengen’s fertile ribbon flourishing before a hobgoblin siege and red mist, a fragment of the Heartroot being reverently uprooted and brought to this valley, and long years of confinement beneath a narrow sky.
- The mirror finally revealed the jade wizard Rai standing here speaking with Beryl about plague relics, Dimitar guarding a prison, and closing a Limbo portal opened by Cha'mutte’s death before hobgoblins found the last Heartroot relic.

### Heartroot's Return to Istheros

- Kenzo communed with the heartroot and learned it was part of the river Istheros and could grow only at the center of the upper Istheros Valley.
- The heartroot expressed eagerness to rejoin the river but revealed the waters were fouled by a portal to Limbo.
- The party set a plan to close the Limbo portal, cleanse the Istheros, and then return the heartroot to its home.
- They considered using a plane-slicing wand and a portal-finding wand to locate and seal the rift.
- They chose to seek guidance from the Philosopher's Guild and from Beryl's priesthood, including the Priestess Catalan Malra.
- They recalled Beryl had sacrificed himself to kill Cha'mutte.

### Vision of the Limbo Wound

- The party returned to camp and found Cuddle in Malra, Ranger devotee of the Fox and Hunter, in prayer to Beryl.
- Malra recalled that the Green Man once spoke with the Fox and the Hunter before the [[War of the Ashen Horde]] and vanished on a quest.
- Malra led an incense prayer to Beryl beneath the rising Fox and the Hunter, opening a shared vision.
- Beryl revealed the calamity was a planar wound rather than a portal, a vortex of Limbo spilling into Isengay.
- The vision showed Rye on the Isteros River before Isengay with monks of the Awakened Soul, attempting to close it and vanishing as his hand shattered into five.
- Beryl conveyed that cracks in Apollyon’s Limbo‑wrought prison had swelled the Plaguelands since Cha'mutte’s death, and that the remedy lay in traveling to Limbo to pull the plane back.

### Toward the Limbo Gash

- Beryl’s vision revealed the Izengay wound as a chaotic gash to Limbo born of Cha’mutte’s death and swelled by Apollyon’s unraveling.
- The party resolved to enter Limbo to close the gash from that side and later clean up the spillover in the material world.
- The Taunti answered that Limbo’s geometry was uncertain, survival there was possible without protection, natives were unknown, and Rye and some monks still lived and were sane.
- The company planned to seek the Philosopher’s Guild in Tolin, trading Dust of Glibness and a Frostbrand greatsword for guidance on healing the wound and surviving Limbo.
- Preparations included using their Bastion’s archives and observatory to research Limbo and Contact Other Plane to question Rye.
- The group confirmed they could Plane Shift to Limbo using the Chaos Medal as a focus.
