## Narrative 

Our session begins as the party soars over [[Emberwine]] on exotic griffins with peacock plumage—except for [[Wellby]], who proudly guides his newly trained wyvern. Their fey companions [[Valeris]] (a cursed satyr) and [[Ismara]] (a scholarly documentarian) travel alongside them as they journey east toward the [[Sunset Gate]].

During the journey, troubling news reaches [[Riswynn]] through the [[Crown of Purity]], which she continues to struggle to wrest from the taint of generations of control by members of [[The Cleansed]]. Chardon has fallen into chaos, with riots led by a group calling themselves the [[Eightfold Flame]] and preaching the evil of [[chalyte]], and a power vacuum left by the absent [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]], who is negotiating [[Nayan Karnas]]' surrender in [[Darba]]. 

Encouraged by [[Seeker]]'s questions, [[Ismara]] explains that unlike the mundane world (what she calls the [[Material Plane]]), the [[Feywild]] changes through the will of the archfey rather than natural processes and cataclysm. She speaks of [[Fate's Ruin]], a fey realm near of her home in [[Gleamwater]], transformed by the [[Rust Baron]] from artistic mountains into decay, and how [[Amberglow]] lost its color after the disappearance of the [[Cloudspinner]]. 

The party reaches the [[Sunset Gate]], a massive, shimmering wall capturing all the colors of sunset, stretching endlessly upward. Parts reflect light brilliantly while others appear as crystal or frozen oil paint, constantly shifting and warm to the touch. Although the party notes some cracks in the wall through which a person might attempt to pass, [[Valeris]] and [[Ismara]] warn that time flows differently through the gate: those who enter might emerge in seconds—or in years.

Turning north, the party follows the line of sunset towards [[Amberglow]], after saying farewell to [[Ismara]]. As they fly northward, the landscape becomes increasingly bleached and desaturated—signs of Amberglow's corruption. After some time, the party finally reaches Amberglow, departing [[Emberwine]]. As they cross the border, soaring on griffons and a wyvern, four enormous humanoids below yell up at them, demanding "one vial of blood each" as toll. The party circles higher and continues their journey after [[Valeris]] confirms nothing good comes from giving [[fey]] creatures blood. 

Later, they spot distant figures—three giant wolves carrying armed riders with dozens of smaller wolves running alongside them. When the wolf riders begin pursuing them, the party realizes they can't outrun these endurance hunters indefinitely and formulate a battle plan.

The battle unfolds dramatically: [[Wellby]] rains arrows from above, [[Delwath]] unleashes an ice storm from a distance, [[Kenzo]] leaps from his griffin to engage the enemies directly, and [[Seeker]] uses telekinesis to fling a rider from its mount. The tide turns when one wolf unleashes a terrifying psychic howl that blasts through the minds of [[Kenzo]], [[Delwath]], and [[Riswynn]]. [[Kenzo]] is temporarily knocked unconscious, but [[Riswynn]] summons a pillar of celestial light that obliterates smaller wolves and heals her allies, and eventually the enemies are defeated.

After the battle, [[Seeker]] identifies the fallen enemies as [[Duskhounds]]—lieutenants of [[Lord Umbraeth]], the Gloomshaper, whose realm of [[Duskmire]] has expanded into the edges of [[Amberglow]] since [[Cloudspinner]]'s disappearance. [[Seeker]] recalls that [[Lord Umbraeth]]'s servants had captured at least one [[Amberlight]], potentially allowing them to track the [[Cloudspinner]].

As they continue northward, they spot a strange, unnaturally white river surrounded by dead trees. Beyond it lies their ultimate destination: [[Redsun Watch]]. From a distance, all that can be seen among the river of darkness flowing from [[Hollowdark]] is the upper third of one tower, still catching sunlight while the rest of the keep has been swallowed by inky night, coming from massive tear in the [[Sunset Gate]]. Our session ends as the party halts to plan their approach.

%% LONG NARRATIVE



The companions soared over the rolling fields of Emberwine, their mounts striking contrasts against the eternal afternoon sky of the Feywild. While most rode griffins unlike any seen in the mortal world—their heads adorned with peacock and parrot plumage rather than eagle features—Wellby proudly guided the wyvern he had finally trained during their stay at Lord Sovin's court. Their two fae companions accompanied them: Valeris, a satyr cursed to brutal honesty who sought redemption through selfless acts, and Ismara, a scholarly fae from Gleamwater documenting the peculiarities of the mundane world.

They had departed from Sunwine Hall after what seemed like two days, though time flowed strangely at the revels of Lord Sovin. During their stay, Delwath had defeated the brash duelist Arendelle in single combat, earning popularity by telling stories for the next two days. They'd also encountered Count Vashen, known as The Broken Mask, a former courtier of the Cloud Spinner who had betrayed her and sought to forget his past—until Kenzo's cleansing touch momentarily pulled him from his self-imposed amnesia.
As they journeyed east toward the Sunset Gate before planning to turn north to Red Sun Watch, fragments of troubling news reached Riswynn through her crow messenger. Chardon had fallen into chaos—riots led by the Eightfold Flame, arson against Chelite industry, street fighting, and vigilante justice. The magistrates remained in Darba negotiating Karnas's surrender, leaving a power vacuum. Meanwhile, the general who had been marching against Sura had surrendered after the crown was taken from Fausto, while the navy had defeated Karnas outside Darba.
Riswynn continued her struggle with the crown, unable to fully bend it to her will after it had been used for mind control by the cleansed leaders for generations. Without guidance or powerful information, she could either reset it to factory conditions—sending it away until found again—or find some way to master it herself.
During their flight, Seeker engaged Ismara in philosophical exchanges about their worlds. The fae scholar explained that the Feywild didn't change through cataclysm as the mundane world did, but through the will of the Archfey. She told of Fate's Ruin, once filled with living statues and artistic mountains before the Rust Baron transformed it into a realm of decay. Similarly, Amberglow had been bleached of color since the Cloud Spinner's disappearance—a wrong they hoped to right.
Days passed in the strange timelessness of the Feywild, where hunger rarely struck and the sun never truly set, merely dimming as they traveled eastward. Ismara shared details of the realms she had passed through: Fortune's Rest governed by the Chance Weaver, Shimmer Song where Lord Egan turned crystals into fruits, and Everlight's Bloom with its eternal afternoon warmth and glass-like flowers.
Finally, they reached the Sunset Gate—a massive, shimmering wall stretching endlessly upward and to either horizon. Parts reflected light brilliantly, while others appeared as orange and red crystal, and some sections resembled oil paint frozen in mid-air. The wall constantly shifted and changed, warm to the touch but unbending and unbreakable. Valeris and Ismara warned that while distances in the Feywild were inconstant, time flowed normally through the gate—those who passed through might emerge years later.
Despite Seeker's natural curiosity about the barrier and what lay beyond it in the Nocturne Vale ruled by the Duke of Dreams, the party resisted the temptation to pass through. Instead, they resolved to continue northward along the gate toward Red Sun Watch, where they hoped to discover the secret to finding the Cloud Spinner's prison well—a quest that would require breaking darkness with true sunlight to illuminate their path.
The companions continue their flight along the Sunset Gate, watching its ever-shifting colors while moving through an increasingly desolate region of Emberwine. As they press northward, they notice the vibrant landscape gradually becoming bleached and desaturated—the first signs of Amberglow's corrupted terrain. Ismara, their fae scholar companion, grows uneasy as they reach the border where Nocturne Vale transitions to the more dangerous Hollow Dark. Unwilling to venture further without proper guidance, she bids them farewell, turning south to seek a Dreamwarden who might safely lead her across.
The party soon encounters their first challenge when, flying about 100 feet above a line of jagged hills, they spot four enormous humanoids—each standing 15-20 feet tall with twisted features and carrying primitive weapons. The giants demand "one vial of blood each" as toll for passage. After brief consideration and confirmation from Valeris the satyr that nothing good comes from giving fae creatures blood, they circle higher and continue their journey, ignoring the giants' curses. As they fly, the group discusses the nature of the Sunset Gate—not merely a barrier to keep creatures out but a division between realms of light and darkness that must extend as high as necessary to prevent sunlight from entering the dark realms.
Several hours later, Wellby spots distant figures in the plains below—two or three small riders with some kind of pack moving around them, heading toward the party's position. Curious about these approaching travelers, the companions wheel their mounts in that direction to investigate.
As the party wheels their mounts toward the distant figures, they identify three enormous wolves—each fifteen to twenty feet long—carrying riders armed with bows and swords. Dozens of smaller wolves run alongside them in what appears to be a hunting formation. When the wolf riders spot the party, they immediately change course and begin pursuing them across the bleak landscape.
The companions initially flee, realizing they can slightly outpace the wolves but may not be able to maintain their lead indefinitely. Their mounts, burdened with riders and supplies, will eventually tire. After a brief discussion, they decide that evasion is impractical—these appear to be endurance hunters that would simply track them across the open plains. Instead, they formulate a plan to engage on their own terms.
Delwath suggests slowing down to let the pursuers close to 600 feet—the maximum range of his Ice Storm spell when enhanced with metamagic. Wellby proposes flying the wyvern to a higher altitude to keep it safe from combat, as they're unsure of how it might react if wounded. From there, Wellby and Kenzo can descend to attack from above while Delwath offers to cast Fly on party members to increase their mobility. The party begins arranging themselves in a spread-out formation to avoid being caught in potential area attacks as they prepare to face the relentless wolf riders.
The party maneuvers into combat position as they prepare to engage the wolf riders. Wellby dramatically dives from the wyvern, activating his flight to position himself 300 feet above the battlefield, where he strikes one of the riders with a precise arrow shot. Delwath follows with a devastating Ice Storm, extending its range with metamagic to reach the enemies 600 feet away. The spell pounds the lead wolf and rider with ice and creates difficult terrain, slowing their advance.
Not content to fight from a distance, Kenzo boldly jumps from his griffin and uses Raven's Whistle to propel himself forward at incredible speed, covering nearly 450 feet to engage one of the wolf riders directly. The enormous wolf immediately attacks, its poisonous bite landing a glancing blow despite Kenzo's attempt to deflect it. The shadowy horned rider wielding a greatsword swings at Kenzo, missing but still causing damage with each near-miss of its massive blade.
Seeker cleverly uses telekinesis enhanced by three crystal charges to target one of the riders, succeeding in lifting it off its wolf and flinging it backward, temporarily restraining it. As the remaining wolf riders continue their approach, Delwath casts another Ice Storm, obliterating many of the smaller wolves and further damaging the larger threats. Through Soul Sight, Kenzo identifies these shadowy opponents as powerful CR 8 creatures with resistance to cold and necrotic damage, making them formidable adversaries for the party to overcome.
The battle against the wolf riders intensifies as Kenzo moves to attack the restrained shadow rider, taking advantage of Seeker's telekinetic hold. Despite deflecting a bite from the giant wolf as he moves, Kenzo is quickly surrounded by a pack of smaller wolves that tear into him. Before he can recover, the giant wolf and its shadowy rider launch a devastating series of attacks that leave him unconscious and bleeding on the ground.
Seeing their companion fall, Delwath and Riswynn coordinate a daring rescue. Delwath quickens a dimension door spell, teleporting both himself and Riswynn directly next to Kenzo. Riswynn immediately summons a pillar of celestial light that obliterates the smaller wolves, damages the larger threats, and restores Kenzo to consciousness. The tide begins to turn as Seeker uses his magical ladder construct to crush one of the riders, while Wellby continues raining arrows from above.
The battle's momentum shifts when one of the wolf riders unleashes a terrifying psychic howl that blasts through the minds of Kenzo, Delwath, and Riswynn. As the companions recover and press their attack, the shadow riders begin to falter—one teleporting away after Riswynn shatters its horn with her hammer. The remaining giant wolf attempts to flee but collapses as Delwath slashes its legs. In a final act of vengeance, the last shadow rider fires three arrows at Delwath, the third piercing his leg and temporarily pinning him in place as the battle draws to its conclusion.
As the battle nears its conclusion, a wounded wolf flies into a rage at seeing its rider slain, savagely attacking Seeker's ladder construct and nearly tearing it apart. Meanwhile, Riswynn continues to strategically position her pillar of celestial light, its radiance obliterating more wolf minions and bathing her companions in healing energy whenever they pass through it.
Wellby descends closer to the battlefield and launches a lightning arrow that strikes the restrained wolf with explosive force, killing it instantly while sending arcs of electricity toward nearby foes. Delwath, pinned by an enemy arrow, transforms into a swarm of butterflies to escape his restraint before flying through Riswynn's healing light and cursing one of the remaining shadow riders.
With renewed strength, Kenzo charges the last giant wolf and lands a perfectly placed strike that stuns the massive beast. Taking advantage of the wolf's vulnerability, he unleashes a barrage of staff strikes and punches, battering the creature mercilessly. Though the wolf's rider teleports behind Kenzo to attack, the monk's supernatural reflexes allow him to avoid most of the damage.
As Seeker directs his damaged ladder construct to continue the assault while using telekinesis to restrain another enemy, Riswynn moves her pillar of light once more, catching multiple foes in its radiance. The stunned wolf falls as it automatically fails to resist the celestial damage. Finally, Kenzo closes in on the last remaining shadow rider and, despite an initial miss, uses his inspiration to land a precise strike followed by a flurry of devastating blows that reduce the creature to dust, bringing the chaotic battle to an end.
After the battle, the party notices Wellby's wyvern has flown off in the heat of combat. Wellby pursues it using his magical armor and boots of speed, eventually catching up but struggling to fully regain control as the creature continues flying northward along the Sunset Gate.
While Seeker examines the fallen enemies, he recognizes them as duskhounds, lieutenants of Lord Umbriath, the Gloom Shaper who rules the northern realm beyond Amberglow. Valeris confirms this identification, adding that Lord Umbriath's territory has grown considerably since the Cloud Spinner's disappearance, expanding into lands that once belonged to Amberglow. Seeker also recalls that Lord Umbriath's servants had captured at least one amber light, potentially allowing them to track the Cloud Spinner.
The party takes a short rest to recover from the battle before continuing their journey. As they fly northward, they spot a strange river about 20 miles ahead—appearing unnaturally white and still, almost ice-like, surrounded by dead trees that grow up to the Sunset Gate. Beyond this river, approximately 60 miles distant, they see what appears to be a massive tear in the Sunset Gate itself—a wall of pure darkness spreading across the horizon.
Drawing closer, they observe that the darkness varies in density, with some areas appearing as impenetrable black fog while others allow feeble rays of light to penetrate through like mist. Rising above this sea of darkness stands their destination: Red Sun Watch, a partially visible tower with tarnished golden decorations, its upper third still catching sunlight while the rest of the structure has been swallowed by the encroaching darkness.
