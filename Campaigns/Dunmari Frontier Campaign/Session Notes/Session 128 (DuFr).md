## Narrative
[[chat]]
As dawn crested the barren flanks of the Chattan Mountains, the party gathered on the deck of Vindisharna, anchored a cautious distance from the Thunder Crown’s lightning-wreathed spires. After yesterday’s parlay with Bruner, the stone giant, the group had gleaned critical details: Skybreaker, the colossus ruling this valley, drove his power from chelite; his death ray, slung between the rift’s towers, disintegrated intruders before they could approach the mine below.

Their allies were ready. Octavia, a seasoned bodyguard of the magistrates, stood prepared to command legionnaires once the mine changed hands. Tristan Brighteyes, a young windcaller, waited to relay word of their progress. The group reviewed the tower’s defenses—bald sentries, magical lightning pillar, and imprisoned giants beneath. The plan: teleport directly into the tower, overcome the guards, disable the death ray, then face Skybreaker on ground of their choosing—ideally not within the heart of his lair.

Discussions of alternate tactics—stealth, drowning or trapping the giant, use of potent magic or artifacts—turned, in the end, to direct action. Characters distributed potions and magical inspiration; a scroll of Reverse Gravity, exotic figurines, and healing items were counted, but practicality won out.

With preparations settled, Seeker’s magic shifted the party through space. Their arrival was precise, thanks to Seeker’s practiced hand—spirits high, plans ready, each bracing for the desperate battle ahead.

The party arrived in a vast, thunder-racked chamber, materializing inside a ten-foot circle. The place shook constantly from a huge pillar of lightning that dominated the center of the room, its thunder deafening and disorienting. Along either side, stone barriers rose to the ceiling, separating the group from the rest of the chamber. They spotted two stone giants posted on opposite balconies, distracted and facing outward. Giant statues inlaid with glowing purple veins—possibly chelite—stood nearby. A ladder led to the roof, and stairs descended to a lower floor.

As the noise muddled speech, Seeker maintained a brief telepathic link. Seeing an opportunity, Kenzo rushed the northern giant, his staff and fists striking true several times, disrupting the creature’s focus. Seeker followed with a psychic assault, leaving the giant incapacitated and easy prey for the others’ spells and arrows. Welby gave covering fire, and Darwath’s blasts of force battered the guardian.

As the first giant toppled, the second sounded the alarm and retreated down the stairs; Kenzo and the others gave chase. Seeker summoned constructs to pursue, while Darwath and Welby cut down the second giant. The commotion drew the attention of a third, more imposing giant—clearly their superior—who seized a chunk of crackling lightning from the pillar and retreated behind cover. The party advanced, negotiating obstacles and summoning allies for support, preparing for a confrontation with this new foe.

Welby’s arrow found its mark, angering the stone-skinned spellcaster who clutched a burning crystal. In a tense moment, he pressed the crystal into the chest of a wall-mounted statue, animating a massive chalite giant, then tried to flee past the party. Golems and magic struck at him as he ran; Kenzo’s blows landed, and Seeker unleashed an Eldritch Blast, but the spellcaster pressed onward.

During the chaos, Delwath was seized by spreading chalite crystals growing from within, restraining him and then petrifying him completely despite his frantic efforts to break free. The chalite giant, now animate, stepped into battle, trading heavy blows with Seeker and summoned constructs. Seeker, thinking quickly, cast a spell to unravel the giant’s magic, causing it to revert to lifeless stone. Meanwhile, Kenzo engaged the fleeing spellcaster and managed to stun him, allowing the party to inflict heavy damage before Welby finished the job with well-placed arrows.

With the immediate foes defeated, the group gathered, thunder still echoing in the chamber. Delwath stood unmoving — stone to the core. Seeing no better option, Seeker evoked powerful Wish-magic, restoring Delwath to life and flesh. Amid the fading tumult, the adventurers caught their breath, warily eyeing the remains of their petrifying foe and considering their next steps.

The company found themselves within the storm-shrouded heights of Drukmar’s tower, the air dense with arcs of purple lightning. Seeker examined a crackling conduit of energy, avoiding the jolts that leapt outward whenever he drew near. Through his arcane goggles, he observed veins of purplish gemstone—Chelite—threading through the pillar and vanishing both above and below, the lightning visibly channeling through them. No apparent spell or ritual anchored the effect; instead, the structure itself seemed to perpetuate the magic. Dispel Magic was unlikely to have any effect.

Meanwhile, Welby and Kenzo descended the broad stairs, the crashes of thunder masking any chance of stealth but also ensuring their approach went unnoticed. The lower level proved to be living quarters, with giant-sized beds and a table holding several obsidian bird sculptures. One, a five-foot-tall obsidian hawk, was stowed away in their portable hole. The walls were covered in elaborate Giant runes, which Delwath translated. The mural detailed the legend of the Dowthlaptor—Death Lightning—and the installation of a great Chelite mirror at the tower’s base, which harnessed and projected the tower’s formidable power.

The group pressed down to the tower’s lowest level. There they witnessed a tapestry of red and purple lightning veiling a vast, reflective Chelite mirror—clearly the heart of the mechanism. Before the obsidian walls, a mighty giant, Drukmar, manipulated gold and purple runes to operate a magical viewing portal. Nearby stood a dreamy younger giant, while to the north, a third—chained in place and flanked by two inert Chelite statues—appeared imprisoned.

Silent amidst the storm, the party weighed their options: prepare a sudden assault, or attempt to free the captive giant and perhaps gain an unlikely ally. With a plan forming, they made ready, the tower still deafened by its relentless thunder.

Descending the stone stairs, the party confronted a dark chamber where a towering, chelite-crowned giant stood chained, flanked by inanimate stone statues and an apprentice sorcerer. The air hummed with crackling energy from an arcane lightning mirror at the room’s heart. Kenzo charged first, landing a stunning blow and dislodging one of the giant’s chelite crystals—each apparently tied to its legendary will. Others quickly focused their assaults to break through the creature’s defenses, burning through its reserves of magical resistance.

In response, the apprentice used a chelite stone to unleash a blinding flash, but most of the party resisted its effects. Constructs and an animated ladder, conjured and inspired by Seeker, advanced on the mirror, braving arcs of lethal lightning. Many fell, but the enchanted ladder managed to deliver a significant blow, cracking the glass.

Meanwhile, Wellby and Daowath coordinated disabling magic and ranged attacks, while Kenzo pressed the assault and weathered brutal counterstrikes. The apprentice pressed forward, clearly aiming to animate the stone statues. Delwath conjured a spectral beast to hamper the enemy and finished off the weakened sorcerer. With the apprentice slain and cracks widening in the arcane mirror, the team prepared for the next wave—determined to shatter the chamber’s defenses before more giants could be awakened.

Kenzo, battered but resolute, made the decision to brave the wall of crackling lightning encircling the room. He dashed across the chaotic chamber, enduring a severe jolt as magical energy seared through him. Ignoring the pain, he brought his staff down on the towering Chelite mirror, widening the cracks first split by their enchanted ladder and siege equipment. Striking again, the glass gave way; the mirror buckled, then burst apart in a spray of deadly shards. For a heartbeat, silence held—then deafening thunder erupted, joined by arcs of uncontrolled lightning engulfing everything nearby.

Kenzo, caught within the storm, barely clung to consciousness as the magical backlash ripped through the chamber. The heroic ladder was shattered. Far below, the stone giant prisoner remained chained—until Seeker dashed forward, sounded the Chime of Opening, and urged the others to save the captive from the imminent collapse.

As the last echoes faded, the group realized that, with the lightning vanquished, the enchanted tower was beginning to fall—150 feet above ground. Acting swiftly, Welby and Seeker used their magic to Dimension Door themselves and their allies, including the prisoner, to safety on the rim of the massive pit. Kenzo, mortally wounded, let his spirit slip into the Astral Plane, drifting apart from the chaos.

Moments later, as the ruined tower crashed into rubble, the defeated giants scattered and, from beneath the wreckage, a colossal being began to emerge. The party hastily healed, summoned magical constructs, and prepared new enchantments as the gigantic foe pulled himself free, his stone crown fused to his brow, ready for vengeance.

After making their preparations, the party faced Drigamga Bugger, an immense giant climbing from a deep pit, his body armored in chalite crystal. Welby summoned a magical triceratops to aid them, while Kenzo, fighting in astral form, launched a fierce assault of unarmed strikes, inflicting serious blows. Drigamga retaliated with crushing sweeps of an enormous crystal club, blinding Kenzo with radiant energy, but Kenzo managed to shake off the effects with trained focus.

Welby loosed enchanted arrows, using a seeking arrow to strike the giant in the head. Daleth invoked dark magic, landing a series of hexed strikes, while Seeker unleashed psychic and elemental powers, forcing Drigamga to expend his magical resistances. Throughout the clash, the giant’s chalite armor pulsed with bursts of harmful energy, bathing the battlefield in blinding radiance and hurling boulders that battered the party and healed Drigamga’s wounds.

Despite repeated attacks, Drigamga focused his fury on Kenzo, bringing him down after a relentless barrage. Just as hope waned, Welby and the triceratops pressed their assault, and Daleth struck powerful blows, causing the already-wounded giant to collapse in a titanic explosion of stone and lightning. Debris buried Kenzo, but Seeker rushed to revive him amid the rubble.

As the dust settled in the cold mountain air, the party found themselves on a devastated field, victorious but battered, while ogres and other foes scattered in confusion—the mountain quiet once more, at least for now.
