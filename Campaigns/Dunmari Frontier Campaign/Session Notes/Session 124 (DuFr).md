## Narrative

Our session begins as the party returns to [[Vindristjarna]], drifting over [[Pava and Avaras' House]] on the edge of the [[Garamjala Desert]], after weeks of adventuring in the strange light and twisted hours of the [[Feywild]]. The party spends the day at ease: for the first time in months, no shadow pressed the group, no urgent mission required immediate action. [[Wellby]] watched as [[Baxter]] raced after desert lizards; [[Kenzo]] mediated and reconnected with his teachers, [[Pava]] and [[Avaras]], and his student, [[Amil]]; [[Delwath]] relaxed and looked to provisions for an evening feast; [[Seeker]] disappeared below decks, eager to pore over his recovered tomes on the Plane of Fire and plot a path to find his lost brother. 

[[Riswynn]], newly whole, donned the once-troubled crown without strain; its discordant magic had quieted, allowing her fresh clarity. She spoke with [[Kethra]] and the orc sisters, [[Nuzkar]] and [[Aygul]], inviting discussion about their aims for liberating orcs from [[Thark]], the conversation marking the beginning of a broader campaign and the start of her quest to use the powers of the [[Crown of Purity]] for a noble purpose. 

Only news from [[Sura]], via the Sending Stone, broke the ease of the day. [[Sura]] reported on troubling events: following [[Marius Cusico|General Cusico]]’s abrupt surrender and withdrawal, many soldiers of the [[Chardonian Legion]] retreated, but bands of unruly looters -- deserters seeking booty -- descended on the region until [[Havdar's Warband]] scattered them. While shadow assassins had threatened [[Tokra]], [[Sura]] reported that the timely intervention of [[Stoneborn]] warriors led by [[Drikod]] stabilized matters there. Regarding the larger political situation, she reported that correspondence and diplomatic messages from [[Chardon]] had ceased, deepening her suspicion that something unusual was happening there.

With no immediate danger pressing, [[Delwath]] organized an evening feast, urging the party and their followers to enjoy a rare respite from the pressures of adventuring. As sunset approached, [[Kenzo]] took time for meditation. As he sat, his form began to shimmer, and before the eyes of his companions, he shifted, turning into a ghostly version of himself as he slipped partially into the [[Plane of Souls|Plane of Consciousness]]. [[Avaras]], an elder of [[Kenzo]]’s order, watched on with approval, recognizing the significance of this newfound spiritual mastery. The evening drifted into celebration, music, and shared stories, as followers and friends relaxed together. For the first time in memory, the threat of crisis did not loom overhead, and the group savored a rare moment of peace.

That night, under the influence of [[Delwath]]'s *Dream* spell, Kenzo reached out to his childhood friend, [[Xavier]], in [[Chardon]]. In their shared vision, the setting was an alley behind the old market—a place they once hid as children to eat pilfered sweets. [[Xavier]], battered from a recent brawl and bearing fresh scars, greeted [[Kenzo]] with a mixture of confusion and nostalgia.

[[Kenzo]] learned that unrest had swept across [[Chardon]]. A faction called the [[Eightfold Flame]] was stirring riots against the [[chalyte]] refineries. The riots had started when bureaucrats within the [[chalyte]] trade, under some mysterious compulsion, had exposed their own corruption, igniting public outrage. For a brief time, the [[Eightfold Flame]] and its followers took control of large parts of [[North Bank|north bank]]. But as order swiftly broke down and fires raged across the chalyte refineries in the [[Ragwater Basin|Basin]], the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] declared martial law and ordered legions into the city to blockade the [[River Bridge (Chardon)|bridge]]. Stranger, according to [[Xavier]], was the sudden disappearance of many of the leaders of the [[Eightfold Flame]] the previous day. Though [[Xavier]] claimed momentum remained with the [[chalyte]] workers still rioting, he admitted that he was not particularly well connected among the [[Eightfold Flame]] (serving mostly as muscle when asked), mentioning his friend [[Andros]] might know more. Before the dream ended, [[Kenzo]] urged [[Xavier]] to keep this contact secret, and made plans to meet at [[Xavier]]'s apartment near the [[Foundry Market]]. 

After several days provisioning supplies and making preparations, the party prepared to part ways. [[Riswynn]], supported by [[Kethra]], [[Nuzkar]], and [[Aygul]], teleported to [[Uzgukhar]], where she would begin her quest to save more [[orcs]] from [[Thark]]. The rest of the party gathered aboard [[Vindristjarna]], plotting a course for [[Chardon]] via a roundabout route, hoping to approach in secrecy. During the nearly two-week journey, which takes the ship across [[Dunmar]], the [[Chataan Mountains]], and [[Apporia]] before reaching the [[Gulf of Chardon]] and approaching [[Chardon]] from the west, the party made plans for their arrival in [[Chardon]], and began to release the prisoners trapped in the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], now freed from the magical binding of [[The Cleansed]] by [[Riswynn]]'s reorientation of the magic of the [[Crown of Purity]] to helping the [[orcs]]. 

The first person the party frees is [[Vola]]. She is disoriented, confused, and angry at her captivity, and distraught to be treated with suspicion and questioned, with no clear memories of her time under the control of [[Fausto]]. She tells the party of her last memory: receiving their letter from [[Arendum]], bringing it to her mentor [[Agon]] to discuss, and then being taken by [[Agon]] to [[Fausto's Tower]], after which she remembers nothing clearly. Over time, she became gradually convinced by [[Kenzo]] and the others that she had been manipulated, along with many others, by [[Fausto]] and his allies. Offered hospitality or a place to disembark, she remained uncertain of her future, opting to rest and consider her options on [[Vindristjarna]]. [[Kenzo]] supported her, inviting her to meditate beneath the elven tree at the heart of the ship, and offering space to recover from her ordeal.

Next, the party frees [[Valius]] (who was never magically controlled, but blackmailed by [[Fausto]]) and his twin brother [[Vargus]] (now freed from control). As they share a cell in the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], [[Vargus]] has had some ability to adjust, despite the strange time-altering effects of the mirror. Grateful, and eager to put all memory of [[Fausto]]'s plots behind them, they wish to be let off somewhere outside the [[Chardonian Empire]], seeking quieter lives. 

That afternoon, the party conferred about [[Hektor]], who had spent years as [[Fausto]]’s silent enforcer. Speaking to [[Marcella]] via *Dream* that evening, they learn he must have been controlled by [[Fausto]] for years, and even [[Marcella]] did not know him well before his transformation. But she did speak of his background as a sailor, and his beautiful singing voice. Without a better idea, the party devised a gentle approach to restoring [[Hektor]]: [[Wellby]] would sing old sailors’ songs and tell stories to him each morning, hopefully helping to anchor his identity before releasing him. 

The next day, as the party traveled over [[Tokra]], [[Vindristjarna]] made a brief stop to leave [[Valius]] and [[Vargus]], who liked the idea of a fresh start in [[Dunmar]]. Carrying some coin and a letter of introduction from the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], they departed. 

With these matters settled, the party continued on their careful course, steering [[Vindristjarna]] in a wide arc to approach [[Chardon]] from the [[Gulf of Chardon]] to the west. Our session ends as morning dawns over the ocean and the party prepares to teleport to [[Chardon]].
