## Narrative

After weeks wandering the strange light and twisted hours of the Feywild, the company at last returned to Vindisharna, their skyship anchored above Pava and Avras’s austere monastery in the Danmari Desert. The sand below was still and warm; above, the red stone house cast sharp shadows in the morning sun. The crew—Pava, Avras, Amol, Kethra, the orc sisters Nizkar and Igo, Yota the Denokai, and the Copperharp halflings—greeted the party quietly. Faldrak emerged from the depths of the ship, grease-stained and distracted, already mulling odd inventions.

Kenzo, sunk deep in comfort, broke bread with Pava, Avras, and Amol, trading news and idle argument, especially about the unrest in Chardon—his unease softened by familiar camaraderie. Wellby, reclad in battered leathers and Kenku-tooled armor, stretched out content, bantering with Kenzo nearby, while Baxter raced after desert lizards on the ground below.

Riswynn, newly whole, donned the once-troubled crown without strain; its discordant magic had quieted, allowing her fresh clarity. She spoke with Kethra and the orc sisters, inviting discussion about their aims for liberating orcs from Thark’s god, the conversation marking the beginning of a broader campaign. Meanwhile, Seeker disappeared below decks, eager to pore over his recovered tomes on the Plane of Fire and plot a path to find his lost brother. For the first time in months, no shadow pressed the group—only plans, farewells, and the hush of ordinary morning settling over Vindisharna.

After their return from the Feywild, the party gathered at Delwath’s well-provisioned stead, weighing next steps. Kenzo, seeking news from Chardon, reached out to Sarah in Dunmar using the sending stone. She reported on troubling events: following General Cusico’s abrupt surrender and withdrawal, the Chardonian legions had retreated, but left behind unruly looters who descended on the region until Havdar’s forces scattered them. Shadow assassins had also threatened Tokra, but the timely intervention of the Stoneborn stabilized matters. Though Chardonian demands and threats had continued, Sarah’s correspondence from Chardon had gone silent for weeks, deepening her suspicion that something unusual was happening there.

Kenzo considered contacting old friends in Chardon directly via dream magic, planning to wait until nightfall for a proper conversation. With no immediate danger pressing, Delwath organized a staff appreciation feast, urging the party and their followers to enjoy respite—something rare in recent weeks. As sunset approached, Kenzo took time for meditation. As he sat, his form began to shimmer, and before the eyes of his companions, he vanished, slipping partially into the astral realm. Welby experimented with touching Kenzo’s now insubstantial form, confirming that Kenzo existed in a liminal state, both present and not. Avras, an elder of Kenzo’s order, watched on with approval, recognizing the significance of this newfound spiritual mastery.

The evening drifted into celebration, music, and shared stories, as followers and friends relaxed together. For the first time in memory, the threat of crisis did not loom overhead, and the group savored a rare moment of peace.

That night, Delwath sat awake beneath a sky swept with stars, quietly sharing old stories of wars and recipes. Meanwhile, Kenzo took his rest and reached across dreams to his childhood friend, Xavier, in distant Chardon. In their shared vision, the setting was an alley behind the old market—a place they once hid as children to eat pilfered sweets. Xavier, battered from a recent brawl and bearing fresh scars, greeted Kenzo with a mixture of confusion and nostalgia.

Kenzo learned that unrest had swept the city. A faction called the Eightfold Flame was stirring riots against the chelite factories—those same places that had left physical and spiritual scars on so many. Bureaucrats within the chelite trade, under some mysterious compulsion, had exposed their own corruption, igniting public outrage. For a brief time, the Eightfold Flame and its followers took control of large parts of the north bank. But as order swiftly broke down, fires raged, the authorities cracked down, bridges were blockaded, and imperial troops returned to the city.

The Eightfold Flame’s leadership had apparently vanished the previous day, but momentum remained with the chelite workers, many of whom nursed scars like Xavier and his friend Andres—angry, ready for more change. Kenzo asked after safe houses and learned that some of his old neighborhoods remained untouched, though patrols grew more common. Before the dream ended, Kenzo warned Xavier of his possible return, urging him to keep silent about their contact. The city, tense and divided, awaited what would come next.

After several days gathering information, provisioning supplies, and making preparations, the party prepared to part ways. Riswynn, supported by Kethra, her sister, and Newsgar, rallied a small company of orcs eager to begin the next phase of their struggle for freedom. Their faith in Riswynn was unwavering, though their path remained uncertain. Uzgakar, with its king and resources, was chosen as the group’s next destination—both as a place to gather supplies and perhaps discover more about the mysterious crown in Riswynn’s possession.

With farewells exchanged among the party—some tinged with jesting about surviving without Riswynn’s magic, others more serious—plans were made to remain in contact through magical spells such as Sending or Dream. Riswynn assured the others of the ability to return quickly to allies in need, thanks to the sanctuary prepared in Uzgakar and the power of Word of Recall.

As Riswynn and her new companions vanished in golden light, teleporting away to begin their quest, the rest of the party gathered aboard the Vindrasharna. Debating routes and strategies, they agreed to keep the skyship hidden outside Chardon, wary of attracting the city’s powerful weather mages. Meanwhile, Seeker weighed options for higher magic and potential research, while the party set course through the skies, bound for Chardon and the uncertain politics waiting there.

As the sun dips behind the desert, the party convenes aboard Vindrasharna, debating how best to prepare the skyship for the journey ahead. They conclude that a demiplane—a secluded, extra-dimensional space resistant to scrying—would make an ideal meeting room, while a shipboard pub might both strengthen morale and help gather information. Some discussion follows over the magical beverage on offer, which can bolster courage by protecting against fear for a day after drinking.

Inventory of the ship’s other facilities is taken: an observatory, archive, meditation chamber, and training hall. Meanwhile, Aeris, Kenzo, and Seeker plan to use the ship’s archive to gather lore on the magistrates ruling Chardon, their destination, and to employ scrying magic to scout ahead.

The journey proceeds: after farewells to Pava, Riswynn, and Avaros, Vindrasharna soars across the red mesas above Karawa, then sweeps over the Tokra plains and on to Sungara as dawns pass below. During this transit, the party attempts to scry on Fausto’s old tower in Chardon, but the wards remain unbroken; only the exterior can be glimpsed. There is some conversation about claiming the tower for themselves, recognizing its value, particularly as an airship dock.

As the ship nears Chardon, new priorities form: gathering information, possibly annexing Fausto’s tower, and preparing for whatever awaits in the city ahead.

Aboard their aerial stronghold crossing the deserts of Dunmar, the party reviewed those still held captive within their enchanted mirror. Deciding it was time, they methodically questioned and released several prisoners freed from Fausto’s magical domination.

Vola, disoriented but herself once more, was released first. She expressed confusion and anger upon learning of her captivity, but became gradually convinced by Kenzo and the others that she had been manipulated, along with many others, by Fausto and his allies. Offered hospitality or a place to disembark, she remained uncertain of her future, opting to rest and consider her options. Kenzo supported her, inviting her to meditate beneath the elven tree at the heart of the ship, and offering space to recover from her ordeal.

Next, the twin brothers Belis (never magically controlled, but blackmailed) and Vargos (recently cleansed) were freed. Grateful and eager to put Fausto’s plots behind them, they requested to be let off before the party approached Chardon, seeking quieter lives far from city intrigue.

The party conferred about Hector, who had spent years as Fausto’s silent enforcer. Failing to find anyone who truly knew him before his possession (besides vague memories from Marcella), they devised a gentle approach: Wellby and others would spend days singing old sailors’ songs and telling stories, helping anchor Hector’s identity before releasing him.

With these matters settled, the party plotted a careful course: the castle would arc far over mountains and sea, to avoid notice near Chardon. Their journey would take about a week, using teleportation to approach Chardon discreetly at its end. Along the way, they planned to investigate magical artifacts, and offer Vola further solace, while the twins took their leave in Tokra. The session drew to a close as the flying castle sailed on, preparations underway for what Chardon might bring.
