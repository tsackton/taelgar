Across three days, the party battered the Iron Fang—tsunami, earthquake, infiltration—mauling the host as the Empress pushed relentlessly toward the Heartroot.
## Session Info

### Summary
- At first light, Kenzo communed with the Heartroot—touching a fertile, ancient mind safe yet exiled from the Istaros—after dreams of the Fox and Hunter.
- The party consulted Revaka, who counseled that hobgoblins follow only proven strength and the Empress must be shown unable to protect or lead.
- As eagles they struck with a Wish-cast tsunami on the moving column, killing the vanguard, forcing the Empress aloft, then teleported out; later scrying showed heavy losses and a sealed, ashless Scourge. 
- From a hidden blind they observed an ash-capped, “basketed” camp guarded by silver-metal hawks, ripped an earthquake along its edge, broadcast a noon challenge 500 feet from the host, and withdrew.
- Confirming the Empress inside the Scourge, they used Dimension Door to strike with sunburst, fireball, and sickening radiance before extracting under fire, then scryed chaos-sorcerers shoring morale among roughly 3,000 survivors as Vindristjarna neared and the host pushed toward the escarpment and Heartroot.

## Narrative

Our session begins at first light, after a [[The Fox and Hunter Defend Aurbez|night of dreams]] of the [[Fox and Hunter]]. At first light, as the rest of the party made preparations for the battle campaign of the day ahead, Kenzo walked north and reached for the [[Heartroot]]. Warm bread, rain, yeast; the spring of moss underfoot. He felt an ancient fecund mind, bent and constrained, straining toward home, safe but out of place in this land away from the [[Istaros]]. 

Back at camp in [[Three Wells]], the party spoke again with [[Revaka]], asking for council on their plan of attacks against the marching hobgoblin army of the [[Empress of Chaos]]. Revaka counseled that hobgoblins follow only proven strength, and that if they wanted to dislodge her from control of her army, they must show that she could not protect and lead. 

That morning, under [[Seeker]]'s shapeshift spell, the party crossed the [[Plaguelands]] as eagles, then waited on the arid flats a couple miles off from the hobgoblin's camp, watching a rough oval of billowing ash where the army lay. As dusk approached, metal booms rolled across the waste and the centipede-line began to creep forward. The party rose as well, and closed the distance to the now-moving army. From seven hundred feet, [[Seeker]] bent Wish to call a towering tsunami, placing the wall just ahead so its first surge already covered the vanguard.

Water slammed into ash, turning it to black slurry as the wave advanced in rolling panes. [[Wellby]] slipped ahead and shot the [[Empress of Chaos]] as her flying armor speared skyward; she answered by crossing the distance with terrifying speed, then broke off and hung back to watch. Below, the ash stopped falling where the water passed. Giant plates along the creature’s back clamped shut as hobgoblins dove for safety. The first hundred and fifty feet lay choked with many bodies, thinning sharply beyond. Daylight blossomed around the party, and Delwath’s amplified condemnation rang over the field; a handful of stragglers bolted away from the centipede. With their point made, Seeker took them out in a flash of Teleport, leaving the battlefield awash and eerily quiet. At sunset in [[Three Wells]], Delwath scried the battlefield they had just left. The centipede still crawled, its spines curled tight to seal the army within; ash no longer billowed, and the Empress rode at its head. The ground behind was littered with perhaps a thousand bodies. 

After a night's sleep in camp, during which Kenzo dreaming of heavy vines and sweet earth, the party flew again at dawn to harry the column. They found a new camp: a tight circle under a low ash cap, patrolled wide by silver‑metallic giant hawks with hobgoblin riders. From a hidden blind wrought by Hallucinatory Terrain, Seeker placed a clairvoyant eye inside the camp, seeing a wide, 150-foot circle, survivors packed beneath a lattice “basket” grown from the centipede’s spines, crude metal bunks stacked, many sleeping. The party advanced to a thousand feet, and again used Seeker's Wish to bring down an Earthquake along the camp’s edge. The desert heaved; soldiers pitched; fissures ripped open, one plunging a hundred feet. Over the tremor, Delwath’s projected voice set terms: the Empress to meet them at noon, five hundred feet from her host, or expect more strikes. Then they withdrew and teleported back to Three Wells. 

They waited, then cast scry again on the march. The woven basket of the centipede flowed off as the construct stretched to full length while hobgoblins mustered below. The [[Empress of Chaos]] hovered sixty to seventy feet up, giving a speech that promised a day-and-night advance under the protection of the magic and power of [[Limbo]], boasting that Chaos preceded any god. The ranks wavered—half inspired, half skeptical—but none defied her. After some discussion of the effects of their attacks and the next steps, the party slept for the night. 

The next morning, the party rose in the pre-dawn light to meet the centipede-engine at noon. Kenzo could still sense the Limbo-tainted aura of the [[Empress of Chaos]], moving with the host, night and day as promised, covering at least 60 miles since yesterday. As in previous days, the party shifted into eagles with Seeker's Animal Shapes spell, flying to meet the hobgoblin army. Using Seeker’s Clairvoyance spell, they confirmed the Empress of Chaos lurked within the centipede. The interior was a fifty‑foot‑tall tunnel of darkness and flickering blue, choked with angled shelves and thousands of hobgoblins—many sleeping at odd tilts, others armored amid a constant metallic hum. Suspecting the Empress would not emerge for the challenge, the party chose to strike‑and‑withdraw: Dimension Door in, unleash devastation, then extract.

They appeared among the spikes and catwalks. Seeker hurled Sunburst down‑tunnel; blinding radiance crushed ranks a hundred feet away. Wellby tore a bead from Kenzo’s necklace and loosed a Fireball into a dense knot of troops. Delwath quickened Sickening Radiance behind them, its sickly glow sealing the rear, then cut down nearby sleepers. Heat roared back—a hidden blast that scorched Seeker and Delwath—while hobgoblin units surged from both sides. Kenzo turned aside part of the assault, took a brutal hit, then answered with another Fireball and, mid‑melee, yanked hair from a hobgoblin for a future arcane link. A command rang out; wall‑spikes shot forth and pinned Delwath, and flaming arrows hissed through the dark. Over the chaos, Delwath denounced the Empress as a coward and urged surrender. At the top of the next heartbeat, Seeker Teleported them out.

Through scrying, they watched the living siege-thing still flowing forward, its interior reformed into ordered sections where hobgoblins tended the wounded. Disfigured chaos sorcerers patrolled the aisles, colors whirling about their heads, eyes flashing, thin streamers of fire trailing from their arms. They preached that suffering birthed power, chaos lay within, and pain would unlock it; flame demonstrations curled harmlessly past their own. Many straightened under the exhortations, yet doubt lingered—roughly a third resisted the creed.

Their strikes had bitten deep: the tsunami erased nearly a quarter of the host, the earthquake sowed further losses and confusion; perhaps three thousand remained. The assault, however, had hastened the hobgoblin's march. Our session ends the evening of August 10th as the party withdrew to camp. [[Vindristjarna]] was expected to arrive by morning, with the hobgoblin army reaching the escarpment by the following evening, and then the [[Heartroot]] less than a day later.

## Detailed Summary

### Heartroot and the Tsunami Challenge

- The Fox and Hunter heeded a night of prayers, quickened Martin Strongbow’s steed, and sustained the exiled Heartroot while watching Limbo-tainted hobgoblins camp beneath an ash shroud.
- The Alliance at Three Wells readied militias to guard the Hidden Valley thirty-five miles away, keeping the Heartroot’s location oath-bound and urgent.
- Kenzo walked north to commune with the Heartroot’s vast, ancient life, sensing rich growth and a strained, wrong-set presence longing to be returned to Isengay.
- The company mapped a guerrilla campaign against the iron centipede host, favoring a far-cast tsunami with druidic flight for approach and teleportation for escape.
- Rivaka counseled that hobgoblins followed proven strength, so the plan aimed to show the Empress of Chaos could not protect her army.
- The day’s strike resolved to arrive visibly, unleash the tsunami, proclaim a booming challenge to single combat before the host, and withdraw cleanly.

### Tsunami Strikes the Ash Centipede

- The company flew to the ash-shrouded centipede camp by mid-afternoon and waited at a distance until it began to move near dusk.
- Seeker conjured a towering tsunami before the advancing line, turning ash to sludge and forcing the great creature to a halt.
- The wave smashed through the vanguard as giant metal plates along the centipede’s back clanged shut, leaving bodies dense in the first stretch and thinning beyond.
- Welby advanced and shot the Empress of Chaos as she rose in her flying armor, drawing her swift approach before she pulled back to watch from range.
- Bathed in daylight, Delwath delivered a booming denunciation of the false god, and a handful of rear stragglers broke and ran.
- With the ash storm fallen silent and the Empress observing, the party withdrew by teleportation.

### Quake and Challenge at Basket Camp

- Delwath scryed from [[Three Wells]] and saw the sealed centipede still advancing with the Empress riding it and roughly a thousand dead hobgoblins strewn behind.
- The party scouted as eagles, spotted silver metallic hawks with hobgoblin riders patrolling a wide ring, and withdrew when the patrols refused to leave their perimeter.
- From a concealed hallucinatory blind, Seeker’s clairvoyant eye revealed the centipede turned on its side with spines woven into a lattice basket roofing a tightly packed camp of bunks.
- An earthquake shattered the ground along the camp’s edge, ripping open deep fissures through the crowded formation and throwing the hobgoblins into chaos.
- A blazing display carried Delwath’s booming challenge to the Empress to face them at noon away from her army or suffer continued strikes.
- The company teleported away to safety to observe the aftermath and prepare for the proposed duel.

### Empress of Chaos vowed nonstop march

- Scrying revealed the woven centipede construct flowing open as hobgoblins mustered beneath the Empress of Chaos delivering a fervent speech.
- The Empress vowed a day‑and‑night march safeguarded by Limbo and promised vengeance, while the host answered with uneven enthusiasm.
- The company resolved to attend the noon parley for single combat and to honor fair terms without surrounding her with allied shapeshifters.
- The party judged the construct sealed against outside magic and identified thunder, lightning, acid, and brute force as their best options, with Vindristjarna two days distant.
- A contingency formed to Clairvoyance the interior and send Kenzo on hit‑and‑run strikes inside the shell with escape routes prepared.
- At dawn on August 10, Kenzo’s senses found the host about thirty miles from the river, still marching toward a crossing and the heart route at three miles an hour.

### Sunburst inside the Centipede

- Seeker’s clairvoyance revealed a dark, spike-studded interior crammed with hobgoblins within the 600-foot centipede.
- The party dimension doored inside and Seeker unleashed a Sunburst ahead, blinding and felling masses of hobgoblins.
- Wellby and Kenzo hurled fireballs into nearby ranks as Delwath raised Sickening Radiance behind and cut down unarmored sleepers.
- The centipede’s defenders answered with a searing blast, wall spikes that impaled and held Delwath, and flaming arrow volleys.
- Kenzo tore hair from a hobgoblin for Delwath while fending off charging ranks at close quarters.
- Seeker teleported the group out as Delwath denounced the [[Empress of Chaos]] and urged the hobgoblins to overthrow her.

### Scrying the Chaos Host

- Scrying revealed the creature’s interior had reshaped into ordered sections with wounded being tended.
- Chaos-touched hobgoblin sorcerers with swirling colors and streaming fire walked the ranks preaching power through suffering.
- A sorcerer conjured harmless flame while exhorting a wounded soldier that primordial chaos within would soon unlock.
- Morale appeared fractured, with roughly a third of nearby hobgoblins skeptical despite the exhortations.
- Casualty estimates placed the host near 3,000 remaining, giving the valley’s muster a numerical edge.
- The company set an escarpment ambush for tomorrow using Erupting Earth, eagles dropping boulders, an ice turret, and [[Kenzo]]’s astral strike as Vindristjarna arrived.
