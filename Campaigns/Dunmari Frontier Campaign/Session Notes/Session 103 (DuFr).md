## Narrative

We begin on [[Vindristjarna]], hovering over the bustling orcish city of [[Uzgukhar]], with morning activities visible below, the slain body of the [[merfolk]] warlock [[Buruli]] wrapped in a cloak on the deck, and the rescued halfling crew of the [[Stormdancer]] adjusting to their situation. Faldrick, a dwarf with a silver cane, approached [[Seeker]] urgently, demanding a passcode to verify the party's identity, claiming to be wary of another doppelganger attack. After the party confirmed their identity and inspected the treasures on the [[Merfolk Quest Treasure#From Buruli's Body|dead merfolk's body]], [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] told his tale. Two days ago, the ship was attacked by Seeker's doppelganger, a fierce battle with Seeker's clone unleashing powerful spells, leading tot he deaths of [[Jotha]] and [[Aygul]]. The doppleganger was only driven off, as [[Faldrak Bronzehammer|Faldrak]] tells it, by the power of the icicle turrets he was firing. 

The party spends some time discussing the aftermath and implications of these events, and mourning the losses of the battle, while being grateful that their crew stopped the Seeker clone from capturing [[Vindristjarna]] in its entirety. During the conversation, [[Riswynn]] agrees to raise the dead, but needs time to prepare. The party, eager to be on the move, spends a few hours organizing supplies, and rounding up a wizard to help free the rest of the [[Stormdancer]] crew still trapped as half-sharks, before departing Uzgukhar for the south. [[Wellby]] manages to convince [[Milo Thistlefoot]] and crew to remain on board for some time, at least, with the promise of adventure. 

Just past noon, the party departs. With [[Vindristjarna]] underway, the party distributes magic items and thanks for aid in a small ceremony for the crew. The ceremony was interrupted by an urgent message using the [[Drankorian Message Stone]], from [[Sura]], reporting first that three Chardonian legions were mobilizing and on the march towards [[Songara]], and more importantly, that a doppelganger of Wellby was causing chaos in [[Illoria]] by sinking ships. Ultimately, the party decided they could not divert from their quest to deal with the pirate Wellby, but told  [[Sura]] they would think on it, and that evening had further conversations with [[Sura]] and with [[Abha]] about the situation via the Dream spell. 

The next morning, [[Riswynn]] resurrected [[Aygul]] and [[Jotha]] using Raise Dead. [[Aygul]], an [[Orcs|orc]], described a strange, dark prison with a growing light, relating her experience to [[Thark]]â€™s domain. [[Jotha]], a [[Deno'qai]], described being trapped in a stone-like encasement with other souls. In the course of this conversation, the party realized that the souls of people killed by the dopplegangers were, somehow, being trapped in the locks of [[Apollyon]]'s prison, and as these trapped souls broke free, it was weakening the lock. This was confirmed both by the [[Tanshi]], who reported to [[Delwath]] that some souls of their followers were missing, and [[Wellby]], who sensed a hole in the halfing ancestral memory. This then explained why the dopplegangers were causing so much chaos, and increased the urgency to do something about them. During this discussion, the party also used the [[Mirror of the Past]] to examine the dust from Seeker's doppleganger, seeing a [[Dust from Seeker's Doppleganger Vision|vision of its past]]. 

While discussing what to do next, [[Riswynn]] received an urgent message from her clan in [[Tharn Todor]], reporting that her doppleganger had recently appeared and was apparently -- and very successfuly -- recruiting warriors for a mission to the deep underdark, which seemed doomed to failure and death, likely in an effort to cause the deaths and harvest the souls of many dwarves. Unwilling to let the dwarves of [[Tharn Todor]] be led to their deaths, [[Riswynn]] used Word of Recall to teleport, with [[Kethra]], to help, while the rest of the party debated what to do about the pirate clone of Wellby. 

Using scrying, [[Delwath]] was able to find both the pirate Wellby, seeing him onboard a pirate ship called The Vengenance, and the Seeker doppleganger, apparently waiting or standing guard in [[Drankor]]. The party decided, then to use Seeker's magic to create a simulacrum of Kenzo, and send it to destroy the pirate Wellby clone. 

We end the session the following day, in the late afternoon, after Seeker spends all night casting simulacrum to make a clone of Kenzo, and then rests and teleports the Kenzo clone, using one of the two dice from the [[Prince of Luck]] to ensure the teleport is on target.
