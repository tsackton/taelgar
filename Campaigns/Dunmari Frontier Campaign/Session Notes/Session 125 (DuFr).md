## Narrative

Amid swirling fog on Vindristjarna, seventy miles from Chardon, the freed prisoners Valius, Vargas, Vola, and Hektor each lingered within the strange effects of recent magical captivity. Valius gradually recognized that his brother was close, even as muddled thoughts slowed all sense of time. In his own haze, Vargas clung to the familiarity of Valius’s presence, piecing together scattered memories and uncertain freedom. Vola awoke in anger and confusion, determined to seek answers and retribution for her betrayal. Hector, once bound by oppressive magic-songs, now recalled fragments of his true self—memories of the sea and the voices of companions.

With the prisoners either delivered safely to new lives or lost in their own reverie, the party—helped by Kenzo’s old friend Xavier—looked to the troubled city of Chardon. Seeker, ever resourceful, conjured a simulacrum and devised means to infiltrate the city unseen, discussing submersion beneath the waters with Faldrak’s magical ice shell or flying in as seagulls using powerful transformation magic.

As shapeshifted birds, the group flew over Chardon’s north bank. They surveyed the scorched Chelite Levels, collapsing refineries, and grim signs of recent unrest. Noting heightened guard presence and displaced residents, they debated their next steps: investigate the fallen Eightfold Flame resistance, clear their tarnished names, and seek out old allies like Xavier and the elusive Andros. With the city’s power fractured, the group resolved to move with both caution and resolve, slipping into the slums in disguise to gather information and determine how best to restore justice and stability.

Disguised as seagulls, the companions surveyed the burnt slums of Chardon, passing guarded walls and a battered market where famine and unrest lingered. They shed their avian forms in a narrow alley—Kenzo guiding them to the cramped apartment of his old associate, Xavier. Lacking the means for subtle illusions, the group concealed what obvious magic items they could, yet still stood out as adventurers in a city emptied by hardship.

Inside the single-room dwelling, the party was greeted by Xavier’s weary mother Francesca and his undernourished sister Adina. Xavier, a sturdy brawler, seemed taken aback by Kenzo’s return, remarking on the strangeness and fortune of his journey. The group offered warmth and food, Delwath conjuring a simple, aromatic meal from magical supplies. As they ate, conversation turned to the city’s decline: desperate famine, fires from recent weeks, and the collapse of organized resistance. Xavier recounted the fighting and futility that had set in among the Eightfold Flame, mentioning the elusive Andros and the Riverside barricades.

Amid shared stories and humble hospitality, Adina expressed curiosity for the wider world, and the group offered fleeting tales of distant lands and dragons slain. Afterward, Delwath discretely dispatched a magical lynx bearing a message to the city’s clergy, seeking an audience and offering aid regarding Faustus’s tower and recent events. Plans set for the evening, the party resolved to meet Andros at the Cackling Swan and await the clergy’s reply, ready to take their next step within the beleaguered city.

Kenzo, Delwath, and Welby, accompanied by Xavier, entered the Cackling Swan tavern as dusk settled over a burned and battered district of Chardon. Their presence drew immediate attention; the room fell silent as they made their way to a table where Andros, a well-known, broad-shouldered worker with a burn-scarred arm, met with two associates: Orsino, a rugged, scarred laborer who informally organized day laborers, and Red, a fiery-haired crane operator who spoke for the barricaded workers.

After brief introductions, Kenzo expressed their intent to support the resistance and asked about the local situation and needs. Red responded with urgency, proclaiming that with the visitors’ power, they could finally destroy the Chelite refineries—a proposal Orsino pushed back against, fearing for livelihoods tied to the refineries’ operation. Kenzo steered the conversation to long-term solutions, encouraging the group to consider not just rebellion, but the creation of structures—unions or guilds—that could shift power into workers’ hands for generations.

The conversation revealed fragmentation among the resistance: leaders were few, and while Red commanded trust among barricade workers, broader organization was lacking; priests led some anti-Chelite factions, but trust and structure were minimal. Kenzo and his companions counseled these leaders to begin organizing, identifying trusted figures from each sector in preparation for larger negotiations. As the evening closed, Andros quietly asked for guidance, fearing that unrestrained violence would follow if clear alternatives were not presented. Kenzo affirmed their support, promising help and urging them to plan not just for the uprising, but for the future afterward.

A silvery lynx strode into the busy tavern, halting conversation as it delivered a sealed letter. The party accepted the message, which invited them to meet aboard Arturian’s Pride—a flagship anchored in the harbor—to prove their intentions to Tiberius Windcaller. After some discussion, and a moment spent bolstering a local revolutionary guard, the group reached out discreetly to a general who had recently suffered under enchantment, offering guidance and emotional support from others who shared similar experiences.

Determined not to part with their weapons, the party avoided local ferrymen and instead assumed the shapes of seagulls, descending upon the warship from above before reverting to their true forms on the deck. There, they drew the immediate attention of the crew. A tall, commanding figure—Tiberius Windcaller—stood ready near the mast, gripping a staff topped with sapphire. The instant the party revealed themselves, Tiberius raised his staff, invoking a spell.

Anticipating aggression, one of the party attempted a countermeasure, but Tiberius’s will held firm and the spell persisted. Instantly, a twenty-foot shimmering cage of force enclosed the group. Despite the magical barrier, the party remained composed, seeking to negotiate with Tiberius and establish terms of trust. The scene closed, their fates uncertain within the confines of the arcane prison.

As dusk settled over Chardon, Delwath, Kenzo, and Welby found themselves encased within an invisible magical cage, facing the vigilant mage Tim. The air was uneasy, shaped by recent citywide turmoil and tales of shapeshifters and clones. Tim, authorized by his cautious master, greeted Delwath and pressed for answers about their true identities and their role in the chaos—most notably the unleashing of Pandemonium’s madness through a dangerous scroll, and the rash of clones and curses plaguing the city.

Recognizing the suspicion, Delwath and Kenzo explained their history with the clones, noting their inability to heal and the defeat of Fausto and Apollyon, whose influence had long corrupted Chardon. Yet, Tim demanded proof that they were not imposters, and especially that the villainous crown—the artifact enabling the creation of magical doubles—was no longer a threat. The group hesitated, choosing their words carefully; revealing too much risked fueling new hunts for the artifact.

Despite not providing the crown’s location, Kenzo assured that neither they nor the crown posed any danger now. Tim, unconvinced but cautious, suggested moving the ship outside city waters for increased safety, empowered by his magical command of wind. As the vessel sailed downriver, leaving distant burning slums and fortress chains behind, both sides sought a path toward trust, aware that proof would require ingenuity and time.

As the sky darkened and Chardon shrank on the horizon, the party found themselves enclosed in a shimmering barrier of force aboard the ship commanded by Tiberius, a Windcaller loyal to the Magistros. Concerns and suspicions were laid out clearly; Tiberius was anxious to ensure none among the group were servants or successors to Fausto, the traitor whose schemes had devastated the city's magical order.

After some discussion of escape and magic, the companions agreed to submit to Tiberius's precautions. They removed and deposited their magical items for inspection and assented to a psychic reading of their intentions and histories. Tiberius questioned each in turn about their connection to Fausto and the infamous Crown, searching for evidence of treachery or hidden allegiance. The party, with care and candor, made clear that Fausto had deceived them as he had deceived so many, and that they had acted in opposition to his designs—enduring betrayal themselves before ultimately assisting in his defeat.

Satisfied, Tiberius shared his perspective on the tangled politics of chalyte—the city’s dangerous magical resource. He described the factions vying for control: the Windcallers, the Heteria Magica, and the mining families, all powerful, all tainted in some way by greed or corruption. He warned the party to distance themselves from certain infamous associations when meeting the Magistros and offered them shelter on his ship for the evening.

As night settled, the group made preparations: some would sleep aboard, others would seek their own quarters, all resolved to organize Chardon’s workers and guilds in anticipation of fraught negotiations ahead. Tiberius promised to arrange a meeting with the Magistros, impressed by the party’s honesty, but advised caution and political subtlety in the days to come.
