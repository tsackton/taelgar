## Narrative

After a night apart, [[Delwath]], [[Kenzo]], and [[Wellby]] reunite for breakfast at [[The Barking Seal]] a quiet sailors' tavern. [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]], having slept aboard the [[Auratan's Pride]], spent time discussing [[Chalyte Rumors from Tiberius|chalyte politics and local power structures]] with [[Tiberius]], a notable Windcaller, trusted confidante of the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]], and critic of the [[Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon]], who he believes are dangerously motivated by profit over safety. While not unsympathetic to the working class, his concerns were primarily about competence. [[Wellby]], meanwhile, stayed at [[The Smiling Crab]], a nearby halfling inn. He brings word that the halfling community, though uneasy, is largely untouched by recent unrest, which remains concentrated [[North Bank|north of the river.]] Their breakfast is briefly interrupted by the simlacrum Seeker 3, who departs on an urgent task for [[Seeker]] ("Seeker Prime") and reminds them to seek magical fire protection for the eventual journey to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] to rescue [[Frankar]]. 

The conversation turns to the current state of affairs in [[Chardon]], and what to do next. It seems incoming shipments of [[chalyte]] have ceased, and bureaucrats who once regulated trade have vanished. [[Fausto]], it seems had targeted the key members of the [[Chamber of Stamps]] who controlled the [[Politics of Chalyte (Chardonian Empire)|chalyte monopoly]] (but not members of the [[Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon|oligarch families]]), and with these key bureaucrats now vanished the entire system was in danger of crumbling. Though no one is certain whether the rioting workers of the [[Eightfold Flame]] could outlast the [[Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon|oligarchs and refinery owners]]. To confirm key details, [[Delwath]] asked the [[tanshi]], learning that upriver trade was largely halted at the command of the merchants who did not want to send raw ore into chaos; the chalyte reserves in the city would last some time but eventually public works would begin to collapse without new supply; and that none of the bureaucrats once controlled by [[Fausto]] both wanted and were able to return to their duties. As their late breakfast concluded, the party decided to split their efforts: [[Wellby]] would pursue word among the docks for insight into the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]], while [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]] would seek information about the chalyte bureaucrats of the [[Chamber of Stamps]]. 

[[Delwath]] began by scrying names from [[Kenzo]]'s list of officials controlled by [[Fausto]], made when [[Kenzo]] briefly possessed the [[Crown of Purity]]. The first target, [[Amelia]], is a mid-level official: she is rocking back and forth muttering a Dwarven prayer under her breath in an attic, and seems to be in bad shape. A flash of foresight from [[Elmerca]] reveals the next target, the most senior member of the chalyte board, would defeat the scry. [[Gaspar]], the last target and another member of the chalyte board, is seen in his estate, tended by a serving woman, clearly not in full control of his faculties. 

Deciding to see what they can learn by speaking to [[Gaspar]], [[Delwath]] and [[Kenzo]] head to his estate on the slopes of [[Mount Nera]], part of the [[Nera Domains]], after a few hours gathering information to find out where he lives. They convince the wary butler they bring aid, and inside they find [[Gaspar]] frail and withdrawn, his mind clouded and hands trembling. [[Kenzo]] discreetly examined his aura, sensing a frightened inner consciousness shielded by layers of confusion and denial. [[Delwath]] began a cautious conversation and requested permission to examine [[Gaspar]]’s thoughts. Sensing their goodwill, [[Gaspar]] did not resist, but [[Delwath]] quickly realized that any intrusive probing caused [[Gaspar]]’s fear to intensify. With [[Kenzo]] focused on calming the scared fragment of [[Gaspar]]’s mind, [[Gaspar]] seemed to indicate he wanted to try to write something, attempting in fits and starts to communicate. Although he scrawled only gibberish at first, eventually—spurred by gentle encouragement and the mention of [[Fausto]]’s fall—he managed to write a single word: “Veldari,” underlined with trembling effort. [[Delwath]], reading his surface thoughts, gleaned that [[Fausto]]’s power had extended not just through mind control but also through bribery, implicating [[Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon|Chardon’s oligarchic families]], and perhaps particularly the [[Veldari Family]]. Spent and emotional, [[Gaspar]] finally slumped, as his servant urged the visitors to let him rest.

[[Wellby]] spent the bulk of the afternoon combing the bustling docks and taverns of [[Chardon]], intent on gathering sailors' views of the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] as well as any useful rumors about the city’s governance. He spoke with navy crew, merchants, and dockworkers, moving easily among them. The naval personnel, in particular, revered the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] as a hero—citing his daring feats at sea, including reputed early adventures against piracy and monstrous threats near the [[Apporia|Apporian Peninsula]]. Their admiration seemed genuine, rooted in stories of his time as a young sailor and later as an admiral who led them to decisive victories. This reputation had cemented his authority among the [[Windcallers]] and much of the populace. Among merchants, [[Wellby]] heard more mixed sentiments. While some grumbled over taxes and tariffs, most acknowledged the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]]’s efforts to improve the city’s welfare, even if some suspected some desire for fame and glory behind his actions. The consensus, even among cynics, was that his policies, though often costly, had curbed piracy and improved public health.

Returning from the [[Nera Domains]] via the [[Chalyte Levels]], [[Kenzo]] gathered information from the city’s working-class populace, learning that the [[Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon|four great oligarch families]] were widely resented, though none stood out as especially better or worse. The [[Patelios Family]] had a reputation for unsafe refineries, while the [[Auratan Family]] and the [[Caloren Family]] were simply seen as detached and indifferent. In recent years, chalyte-powered improvements brought clean water and magical conveniences to poorer districts inside the city walls, fostering a sense of pride—but those living outside the walls, on land largely owned by the oligarchs, saw little benefit and were far more hostile. As dusk fell, the party reconvened at [[The Barking Seal]]. Each received a magical summons from [[Tiberius]], instructing them to present themselves at the [[Imperial Palace]] the next morning. They dined and discussed plans, prepared to face the city’s complex politics in the day ahead.

The next morning, the party gathered at the gates of the [[Imperial Palace]] in [[Chardon]], surrendering their weapons and magical implements to the cautious palace guards. Inside, they passed through opulent halls before entering the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]]’s private chamber—a stark, sunlit room with simple furnishings and a solitary, youthful man awaiting them. After brief courtesies, the group explained their involvement in the recent troubles besetting the city. They described [[Fausto]]’s use of powerful magic to corrupt the [[chalyte]] trade and create magical copies of their likenesses, using these dopplergangers to commit crimes for which they had initially been blamed. [[Kenzo]], a native of [[Chardon]], spoke with particular emotion about their efforts to clear their names and bring [[Fausto]], [[The Cleansed]], and [[Apollyon]] to justice, receiving grateful thanks from the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]], who admitted the city, too, had been deceived.

The [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] updated them on the ongoing devastation: a spreading outbreak of lycanthropy and the difficult healing of those whose minds had been controlled by [[Fausto]], including the general [[Marius Cusico]], who [[Delwath]] had contacted. The [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] thankd the party for their concern and aid, and the party shared a list of the victims they said they had recovered from [[Fausto]]’s possessions (and actually had gained when [[Kenzo]] briefly controlled the [[Crown of Purity]]), offering it as a resource to aid the city’s priests in their work. The party agreed to meet with the city’s healers before departing, offering their knowledge and assistance in the ongoing recovery.

The conversation turned to broader concerns—the recent defeat of [[Apollyon]] and ancient histories tied to [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]] and [[the Cleansed]]. The party recounted what they knew, observing the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]]’s genuine horror at the beliefs of [[The Cleansed]], and sadness at the fate of [[Drankorian Empire|Drankor]], tinged by nostalgia for a lost golden age rather than sympathy for its darker ambitions in its later years under [[Apollyon]]'s ruled. 

With mutual trust and grudging respect established, the conversation turned to the crisis surrounding the [[chalyte]] trade. [[Kenzo]], who grew up in the [[Chalyte Levels]] slums on the [[North Bank]], questioned the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]]’ stance on the trade, its impact on the people, and the growing unrest among workers. The [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] admitted the complexity: [[chalyte]], essential to the city’s survival, was monopolized by [[Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon|four powerful families]], whose influence prevented reform without risking civil war or the lost of chalyte and the collapse of the city which depended on its magic. The [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] spoke of the [[Curia of 42]], an elective council with limited power but that still controlled the sale of the chartered monopolies, including [[chalyte]], and his suspicion of ongoing corruption and bribery keeping the oligarchs in control of the monopoly. 

Willing to contemplate radical solutions to break the status quo, the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] spoke of two potential paths forward to reduce, or eliminate, the influence of the oligarchs: procure incontrovertible evidence of bribery against one family, forcing that family to take the fall and using the scandal to impose conditions on the chalyte monopoly, but leaving the others in charge, or discover a new, independent chalyte source allowing the Magistros to directly control the flow of chalyte personally. As the party leaned towards the more radical solution, he described an abandoned prospect in the [[Chataan Mountains]], which had proved too difficult to claim a generation ago due to giants wielding chalyte magic, as a possible new chalyte source. , where tales spoke of giants wielding chelite magic. In response to [[Kenzo]]'s insistence on a better life for the workers of the [[North Bank]], the Magistros offered to gift [[Kenzo]] all the land expropriated from the oligarchs should the party secure a safe and lasting new chalyte supply for the Empire. 

We end as the party departs the[[ Imperial Palace]], with orders to keep their journey secret, and a promise that the Magistros would deliver information to aid on their quest shortly.
