## Narrative

After a night apart, the companions reunite for breakfast at the Barking Seal, a quiet sailors' tavern. Kenzo and Delwath, having slept aboard the Oratin’s Pride, spent time discussing Chelite politics and local power structures with Tiberius, a notable Windcaller and captain trusted by the city’s magistrate. Tiberius, critical of that city’s handling of Chelite—a volatile, magical mineral—favored stricter, expert oversight, believing most current rulers are dangerously motivated by profit over safety. While not unsympathetic to the working class, his concerns were primarily about competence and the city’s fraught bureaucracies.

Welby, meanwhile, stayed at a halfling inn and brings word that the halfling community, though uneasy, is largely untouched by recent unrest, which remains concentrated north of the river. Their breakfast is briefly interrupted by Seeker 3, who departs on an urgent task for Seeker Prime and reminds them to seek magical fire protection for looming dangers.

Conversation turns to the disrupted flow of Chelite: upriver supplies have ceased, bureaucrats who once regulated trade have vanished, and the monopoly once held by four powerful families falters. The party discusses what knowledge they gained—much of Chardon’s chaos traces back to recent manipulations by the mind-controlling Crown, which targeted key officials but left the mining families largely intact. As they share information, questions arise about current Chelite supplies, the fate of the missing bureaucrats, and whether the strike can outlast the oligarchs, all while considering where best to exert their influence next.

As the city of Chardon simmered beneath the weight of unrest, the companions gathered to strategize before their coming audience with the magistrates. Lacking their usual magical communication, they focused on gathering critical intelligence. Delwath opened with divinations, confirming that the chelite trade was largely halted at the command of the merchant families, while the city’s processed chelite reserves would last perhaps half a year before vital public works collapsed. Notably, none of the key bureaucrats ousted from the Chelaite Control Board both wanted and were able to return to their duties, their wills fractured by Fausto’s sorcery.

With these answers, the group split their efforts: Wellby would pursue word among the navy for insight into the magistrate’s ambitions; Kenzo provided Delwath with names for magical scrying on lost officials; and Darwest turned his attention to tracking one such bureaucrat. The divination revealed Tronia, a junior clerk, wretched and malnourished in an attic, murmuring dwarven prayers, and Gaspar, an elder statesman, withdrawn and broken in a comfortable estate, unable to form coherent thoughts, attended only by a concerned servant.

The party debated the implications: the refineries’ shutdown bled into every aspect of Chardon’s welfare, and their own sizable treasure could sustain strikers for months—should the city’s rulers allow supplies to reach them. But the magistrate, for now, appeared calm, his allies’ reserves and the city’s grain dole forestalling immediate crisis. The companions resolved to pursue their leads and gather what truths they could before entering negotiations, wary of the deep wounds left in the wake of Fausto’s manipulations.

Delwath and Kenzo made their way to Gaspar’s estate on the slopes of Mount Nera, the obsidian bulk of the volcano looming to the west. After several hours spent gathering information, they approached the manor and convinced the wary butler of their intent to help, referencing both their ties to Chardon’s authority and recent knowledge of the mysterious illness spreading among the city’s elite.

Inside, they found Gaspar frail and withdrawn, his mind clouded and hands trembling. Kenzo discreetly examined his aura, sensing a frightened inner consciousness shielded by layers of confusion and denial. Delwath began a cautious conversation and requested permission to examine Gaspar’s thoughts. Sensing their goodwill, Gaspar did not resist, but Delwath quickly realized that any intrusive probing caused Gaspar’s fear to intensify.

Kenzo focused on calming the scared fragment of Gaspar’s mind, radiating gentle reassurances. Delwath, meanwhile, asked for writing materials. Gaspar attempted, in fits and starts, to communicate, scrawling only gibberish at first but eventually—spurred by gentle encouragement and the mention of Fausto’s fall—he managed to write a single word: “Veldari,” underlined with trembling effort.

Through subtle questioning, Delwath and Kenzo learned that Fausto’s power had extended not just through mind control but also through bribery, implicating Chardon’s oligarchic families. Spent and emotional, Gaspar finally slumped, as his servant urged the visitors to let him rest, the interview ending with new leads and a sense of frail hope.

Welby spent the bulk of the afternoon combing the bustling docks and taverns of Chardon, intent on gathering sailors' views of the magistrate as well as any useful rumors about the city’s governance. He spoke with navy crew, merchants, and dockworkers, moving easily among them. The naval personnel, in particular, revered the magistrate as a hero—citing his daring feats at sea, including reputed early adventures against piracy and monstrous threats near the Aporian Peninsula. Their admiration seemed genuine, rooted in stories of his time as a young midshipman and later as an admiral who led them to decisive victories. This reputation had cemented his authority among the Windcallers and much of the populace.

Among merchants and common folk, Wellby heard more mixed sentiments. While some grumbled over taxes and tariffs—especially those affected by reductions in grain prices—most acknowledged the magistrate’s efforts to improve the city’s welfare, even if some suspected personal ambition behind his actions. The consensus, even among cynics, was that his policies, though costly, had curbed piracy and improved public health.

Later, Kenzo canvassed the city’s working-class neighborhoods, learning that the four great oligarch families were widely resented, though none stood out as especially better or worse. The Patelians had a reputation for unsafe factories, while the Oraten and Kellorian lines were simply seen as detached and indifferent. In recent years, chalyte-powered improvements brought clean water and magical conveniences to poorer districts inside the city walls, fostering a sense of pride—but those living outside the walls, under the oligarchs’ control, saw little benefit and were far more hostile.

As dusk fell, the party reconvened at the Barking Seal. Each received a magical summons from Tiberius, instructing them to present themselves at the Imperial Palace the next morning. They dined and discussed plans, prepared to face the city’s complex politics in the day ahead.

The morning after their rest, the party gathered at the gates of the Imperial Palace in Chardon, surrendering their weapons and magical implements to the cautious palace guards. Inside, they passed through opulent halls before entering the Magistrate’s private chamber—a stark, sunlit room with simple furnishings and a solitary, youthful Magistrate awaiting them.

After brief courtesies, the group explained their involvement in the recent troubles besetting the city. They described Fausto’s use of powerful magic to corrupt the Chelite trade and create magical copies of their likenesses, crimes for which they had initially been blamed. Kenzo, a native of Chardon, spoke with particular emotion about their efforts to clear their names and bring Fausto to justice, receiving acknowledgment from the Magistrate, who admitted the city, too, had been deceived.

The Magistrate updated them on the ongoing devastation: a spreading outbreak of lycanthropy and the difficult healing of those whose minds had been controlled by Fausto. The party shared a list of the victims they had recovered from Fausto’s possessions, offering it as a resource to aid the city’s priests in their work.

The conversation turned to broader concerns—the recent defeat of Apollyon and ancient histories tied to Drankor and the Cleansed. The party recounted what they knew, observing the Magistrate’s genuine horror and sadness at the fate of Drankor, tinged more by nostalgia for a lost golden age than sympathy for its darker ambitions.

The meeting established a wary trust, with both sides withholding some secrets and watching for hints of deeper intent. The party agreed to meet with the city’s healers before departing, offering their knowledge and assistance in the ongoing recovery.

Kenzo and his companions met with the Emperor to discuss the crisis surrounding the chelite trade. Kenzo, once a resident of the North Side, questioned the Emperor’s stance on the trade, its impact on the people, and the growing unrest among workers. The Emperor admitted the complexity: chelite, essential to the city’s survival, was monopolized by four powerful families, whose influence prevented reform without risking civil war or famine.

The party explored the political landscape, learning that the Curia—an elective council heavily influenced by bribery—maintained the families’ control. The Emperor revealed two potential paths to break the monopoly: procure incontrovertible evidence of bribery against one family, or discover a new, independent chelite source. He described an abandoned prospect in the Chattan Mountains, where tales spoke of giants wielding chelite magic. Kenzo offered that, should the party succeed in securing a new chelite supply, local workers should lead its future, ensuring fair treatment and agency for the North Side.

The Emperor agreed, promising the party both land and political support if they delivered a new source of chelite. The group debated the risks of infiltration versus challenging the giants directly, ultimately resolving to embark for the mountains, equip themselves, and pursue a lasting change for Chardin. They vowed utmost secrecy as they prepared for their journey, understanding the stakes for both the Empire and its people.
