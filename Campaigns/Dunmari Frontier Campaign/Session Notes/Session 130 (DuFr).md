At [[Three Wells]], the Fellowship exposes the [[Empress of Chaos]]’ plan to corrupt the Heartroot, learns its secret from [[Cateline Malras]], receives a favorable omen, and commits the Alliance to defend the hidden valley while harrying the [[Iron Fang]] and hunting the Empress.
## Session Info
### Summary
- [[Szoltar|Szoltár]]’s boasts and seized thoughts reveal the Empress’s design to pierce the land’s heart, marching with a 4,200‑strong army of [[Iron Fang]] [[hobgoblins]] borne by the magical warbeast known as the Iron Scourge.
- The party returns [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] to the Mirror, floats a containment-treaty idea with [[Revaka]] if the Empress falls, then flies to [[Three Wells]] and joins a heated Alliance war council.
- At the war council, [[Cateline Malras]] discloses the guarded secret: the Heartroot, last pure remnant of [[Isingue]]’s soil-magic, hidden on the [[Aurbez Plateau]]—too frail to move safely and the Empress’s true target.
- Strategy crystallizes: forts and [[Aursenbourg]]’s walls won’t stop the Scourge’s climbing; [[Stoneborn]] aid is ~7 days out while the [[Iron Fang]] arrives in ~6; a favorable divination prompts the Alliance to mass at the Heartroot within five days.
- Interrogation and scrying refine the plan: the army halts 6–10 hours midday; the Scourge serves as transport and food; the Fellowship will harry and sabotage the column, isolate and kill the Empress, and coordinate [[Vindristjarna]]’s aerial strikes.

### Timeline
- (DR:: 1749-08-07): Interrogate [[Szoltar|Szoltár]], travel to [[Three Wells]], learn of the Heartroot and [[Isingue]]'s secret, and plan the defense of the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] from the [[Iron Fang]] armies. 

## Narrative

Our session begins in the morning sun on a hillock in the marshes of the upper [[Aursen|Aursen River]], where [[Szoltar|Szoltár]], a hobgoblin warrior captured by the [[Dunmar Fellowship]] and beguiled by [[Delwath]]'s magic, boasts that the [[Empress of Chaos]]' decades-long plan is now finally coming to fruition. The Empress will pierce “the heart of the land” with the Chaos Spear, seize the Vertex of [[Limbo]], and thereby command the titanic ooze beneath [[Isingue]]. With that power, the [[Iron Fang]] host will ride to conquer the good farmlands north and west of the [[Plaguelands]].

Pressed for specifics, [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] boasts of the great numbers and power of the [[Iron Fang]]. The [[Iron Fang]] army is 4,200 strong -- only the weak and old remain behind -- and their warbeast, the Iron Scourge, will lead the assault. The Scourge is a centipede-like engine of living chaos metal, not truly alive: glowing plates crawl over its body, vast dorsal cavities boom open to vomit ash, then slam shut again. [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] claims the attack will fall in six days, at whatever hour the Empress deems advantageous.

Amid the tension, a cluster of local children edges near. A [[lizardfolk]] boy, [[Leizar]], blurts a nervous question—“Is it dangerous?”—and [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] immediately tries to posture for blood. [[Delwath]] steps between blade and child, and [[Seeker]] quietly turns the moment into wonder: he charms a scrap of moss to life, “Mossy,” which toddles about for an hour to the boy’s delight before an [[Itxal|older lizardfolk woman]] arrives to herd the children away and offer the travelers what little hospitality the huts can spare.

With questions exhausted, the party returns [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] to the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]]. While it is out, they call [[Revaka]]. Though she has little relevant information about the current situation, and has never heard of “chaos metal,” she seems intrigued by [[Delwath]]'s bold offer: if the Empress’s leadership fractures, would [[Revaka]] step in and make a treaty to keep the [[Iron Fang]] contained in the [[Plaguelands]]? She asks for solid intelligence on the [[Iron Fang]], and signs of a true power vacuum, but appears open to the idea. Interrogations done, the party shifts into birds and flies upriver to [[Three Wells]], where [[Marcella]] had spoken of an upcoming war council. 

Winging northwest as eagles, the party leaves the marsh huts and hidden refugee camps in the [[Aursen Marshes]]. A few hours later, the party arrives at [[Three Wells]], to a scene of intense activity: hundreds of people gathered, cookfires, tents, banners snapping, arguments everywhere. Whispers ripple as five eagles glide in, not something [[Three Wells]] sees every day. As the party transforms back into themslves, [[Marcella]] meets them, hustling towards the officer's tent, pressing green ribbons into their hands to tie around their weapons, a peace sign used among the people of the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]]. 

Inside, the war council is in the middle of an argument, standing around a map sprawled across a central table. A [[Eztain|lizardfolk archer]] urges skirmishing in the swamps until [[Stoneborn]] aid arrives; a [[Marguerite la Rousse|red-haired militia captain]] counters that lives can’t be squandered off the plateau; a [[Guilhem du Pont|portly older man]] demands the walls of [[Aursenbourg]] be held to protect the refugees already crowding the city. [[Martin Strongbow]], a [[The Rangers|Ranger]] captain, calls the room to order and asks the party from news, while [[Cateline Malras]], an older dark-skinned woman wearing a [[beryl]] stone at her throat, pours water and passes a bowl to drink from, murmuring “Water before words.” The party drinks, introduce themsevles (Seeker and his simulacrum drawing murmurs), and report the news of the [[Empress of Chaos]]' plan to pierce the heart of the land and bind [[Isingue]]'s magic. 

[[Cateline Malras]] stiffens at the mention of the land’s heart, clutching her beryl. She glances to the Stoneborn messenger [[Zimkala]], then asks for oaths: this next secret must not leave the tent. [[Zimkala]] swears by [[Entamba]]; [[Delwath]] by old and adopted gods; [[Seeker]] by the honor of his people (awkwardly mirrored by Seeker IV); [[Wellby]] by the songs of his people; [[Kenzo]] by his gods and the stories of the living and the dead. Satisfied, [[Cateline Malras]] names the hidden heart of the land: the Heart Root—“the last surviving relic of [[Isingue]]’s magic.”

Leaning on her staff, [[Cateline Malras]] addressed the council and the party with the tale of what they guarded. Long ago, the city of [[Isingue]] was knit together by a living blessing in the soil, a rootlike magic that spread unseen through earth and water, turning vineyards, fields, and families prodigiously fruitful. When [[Cha'mutte]] shattered the land during the [[Great War]], that blessing was wounded and partly corrupted. At [[Beryl]]’s command, the [[The Rangers]] cut free an untainted fragment and fled into the mountains, protecting this fragment of the living soil in a narrow hidden valley on the [[Aurbez Plateau]]. Through the [[Three Kin's War]], through the decades of hobgoblin raids and other dangers, through the years of peace and plenty, the [[The Rangers]] have guarded this valley, where this fragment of living soiling, called the Heartroot, now lives. The Heartroot, however, lives thinly; it no longer spreads as it once did. The [[The Rangers]] charge now is to guard it until it can be restored to [[Isingue]]: if the [[Empress of Chaos]] finds and corrupts it, [[Cateline Malras]] warns, the last pure remnant of Isengae’s magic will be lost. In its current weakened state, moving it might kill it, though in a desperate hour, transporting it could be considered. 

Before the room could sink into despair, [[Marguerite la Rousse]], the red-haired militia captain, argued for resistance: muster was already underway at the plateau stairs and watch-forts. They had survived the [[War of the Ashen Horde]] thirty years prior, when deadly ash-spawn ravaged the land; they could stand again. 

Maps were unrolled and debate began. Given the Iron Scourge’s climbing ability, the walls of [[Aursenbourg]] and the fortifications on the plateau stairs would be irrelevant. The enemy would strike straight for the Heartroot. [[Zimkala]] of the [[Stoneborn]] reported their main force was a week away, likely too late to provide aid unless the [[Iron Fang]] could be delayed or the Stoneborn army sped up. [[Daisy Lightfoot]], a halfling [[The Rangers|Ranger]] and scout master, ran the distances, and calculated the [[Iron Fang]] would reach the plateau in six days time, at least 24 hours before the Stoneborn could arrive. 

The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] joined the debate, and argued for concentrating defenses at the Heartroot, while they worked to isolate the [[Empress of Chaos]] and end the fight by her death. [[Perrin du Bois]], the straw-hatted delegate, a beekeeper and speaker for the scattered homesteads on the plateau, broke the hush with a hard truth: banking everything on the Empress’s death scattering the[[ Iron Fang]] might doom the civilians if it didn’t. The party answered that, scatter or not, the Empress had to fall; the real problem was separating her from the host.

[[Marguerite la Rousse]], the red-haired militia captain, shifted the room’s focus to the greater terror: the Iron Scourge. If they could slow or disable the centipede-engine, the militias and [[The Rangers]], with the [[Stoneborn]] coming soon, could fight a mortal battle instead of a supernatural rout. [[Eztain]], the younger lizardfolk leader, bared her teeth in agreement: she, too, feared the machine more than the hobgoblins.

A flurry of plans followed. The party proposed guerrilla harassment and sabotage at range, to draw the Empress off the column or at least slow the army down, then a decisive strike against her—ideally on ground of their choosing. With [[Vindristjarna]] due in roughly four days, they could add an aerial bombardment, and even contemplate using Seeker's magic to transform hundreds of soldiers into an army of beasts. 

Seeing secrecy had likely already failed to protect the fragments of [[Isingue]], [[Cateline Malras]] sought guidance. Calling on the [[Fox and Hunter]], she cast a divination: _Should the Alliance commit to defending the Heartroot in force?_ The omen returned favorable, and orders quickly followed.  [[Martin Strongbow]], [[Marguerite la Rousse]], and [[Eztain]] moved to order their forces and converge on the hidden valley protecting the Heartroot within five days; [[Zimkala]] pledged the Stoneborn as soon as they could come, likely about a week. [[Delwath]] offered his lynx messengers to carry summons at speed; beacons and ravens would handle the rest.

The civilians remained nervous at the plan, weighing the peril of leaving the approaches undefended. [[Guilhem du Pont]], of [[Aursenbourg]], feared his walled city, swollen with refugees, would be helpless if the enemy veered; though [[Perrin du Bois]] argued the risk was acceptable if the Heartroot was truly the target. The [[Dunmar Fellowship]] committed interrogate their hobgoblin prisoner privately to glean what could be learned about timing and movement of the [[Iron Fang]] army. [[Cateline Malras]] closed with a brief prayer and a final cup of water from the wells as the council broke to draft messages and hurry to mobilize. 

The [[Dunmar Fellowship]], meanwhile, withdrew to interrogate [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] in private. Delwath, cast *Detect Thoughts*, and [[Kenzo]] intimidated and questioned the prisoner. While [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] tried to stonewall, his mind yielded what his mouth would not. He revealed that the [[Iron Fang]] army halts for 6-10 hours in the middle of each day; travels as a disciplined army of five battalions each 800 strong and supplemented by battle mages; the Iron Scourge is primarily a transport device and a source of meat that grows from its body and is hacked off to feed the troops; the army is trained to dismount in lines for battle. [[Delwath]] also read a fragment of the [[Empress of Chaos]]' speech from [[Szoltar|Szoltár]]'s mind: reach the secret heart of the land, corrupt it with her spear, let the darkness and chaos flow, and then take the cities and homesteads of [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]] at leisure and divide the plunder. 

With the spell fading, the party shoved the hobgoblin back into the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], merging his cell with [[Revaka]]'s so she could work him for deeper intelligence. Then they briefed [[Perrin du Bois]] and [[Guilhem du Pont]]: all signs point to the Empress prioritizing the Heartroot over sack and plunder, buying the Alliance clarity on where to mass their defense and where the heroes will focus their strikes.

After a short rest amid the chaos and bustle of the war camp leaping into action, [[Delwath]] scried the [[Empress of Chaos]]. He found the column sheltering beneath a roiling lid of ash while most hobgoblins slept; the Empress paced the perimeter, armor flowing like liquid metal. She sensed the sensor, flicked a glob of metal that sealed its “eye,” and, through the blindfold’s afterimages, Delwath glimpsed unsettling flashes—a stone becoming cloud, then liquid, then ice in a swirl of prismatic mist—before the magic faded.

That evening, the party shared a quiet bench with [[Marcella]], who spoke of her gratitude for their return, and eagerly sought news from [[Chardon]], excited to hear that [[Hektor]] was arriving with [[Vindristjarna]]. She also spoke of her own steadier life among then[[The Rangers]], and the life she had found in the [[Refounded Alliance of Aurbez]]. She offered back the boots of false tracks [[Wellby]] had [[Session 44 (DuFr)|given her long ago]] to aid in her escape from [[Kadmos]]; Wellby told her to keep them. Our session ends as they toasted once, then broke for sleep—plans set, nerves steady—ready to start the harassment campaign of the [[Iron Fang]] at first light.

## Detailed Summary

### Chaos Plans in the Marsh

- Seeker teleported the company to a pine-crowned hillock in the upper Arson River marshes to evade the Empress of Chaos’s search.
- [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] the hobgoblin boasted that the Empress would pierce the heart of the land with the Chaos Spear to seize the Vertex of Limbo and command the Isengay ooze.
- He proclaimed the Iron Fang fielded 4,200 warriors and that the Iron Scourge warbeast could scale the plateau, with the assault due in six days.
- The party secured [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] inside the mirror and consulted [[Revaka]], who agreed to vie for control of the Iron Fang if given information and a fractured leadership.
- Seeker delighted the lizardfolk child Lazar with living moss as an elder gathered the children away, and the group set out for the Three Wells war council as birds.

### Oaths at Three Wells Council

- The companions arrived as five eagles at Three Wells, surveyed the tent camp and watchtower, and saw three stone wells with a central water bowl and ladle.
- Marcella greeted them and led them to the council tent, where green ribbons marked peace and Catalan bade them drink from the well before speaking.
- They introduced themselves and warned of roughly four thousand hobgoblins led by the Empress of Chaos, bearing a colossal ash‑belching metal centipede able to climb cliffs.
- Seeker cast an image of the centipede upon the map as Martin Strongbow, Guillaume DuPont, lizardfolk, a halfling, and the stoneborn Simcala argued over defenses for Orsenburg and the plateau.
- Talk of Isengae, an Ooze Titan, and the Vortex of Limbo stirred Hadolyn and Catalan, who spoke of a guarded secret called the Heart Root and demanded secrecy.
- Seeker and Seeker IV, Delwath, Wellby, and Kenzo swore binding oaths alongside Simcala, agreeing not to reveal what would be said next.

### Council to Defend Heart Root

- An elder recounted the blessing of Isengae and the rescue of its living soil to a hidden valley.
- The council identified this fortress as guarding the Heart Root and judged the hobgoblin centipede to be heading for it.
- Marguerite pledged thousands from the Plateau militias and urged concentrating defenses around the Heart Root over stairs or city walls.
- Dimkala warned the stoneborn would arrive in a week, while estimates placed the hobgoblin host about six days out if marching without rest.
- The council weighed moving the Heart Root aboard Vindristjarna as a desperate decoy but feared the living soil would not survive another transplant.
- The companions proposed isolating and slaying the Empress of Chaos to break the army and considered interrogating their prisoner to refine the timeline.

### Council Commits to Heartroot Defense

- Cataline renounced secrecy, invoked Fox and Hunter, and judged that mustering to defend Heartroot was the right course.
- The council adopted a plan to harry the centipede-borne hobgoblin host with raids, traps, Vindristjarna’s bombardments, and armies of transformed beasts.
- Etsin pledged 600 lizardfolk volunteers for the transformed-beast warbands, and Zimcala promised Stoneborn aid upon their arrival.
- Delwath offered lynx messengers to carry orders swiftly, and the commanders departed to draft and dispatch calls to arms across the plateau.
- Guillaume and Perrin accepted the risk, sought protection and evacuation for Arsenberg and the road villages, and agreed the prisoner would be questioned privately.
- The council affirmed that their guests would scout the host’s true aim, then adjourned as Daisy stayed by the maps for further planning.

### Secrets from the Hobgoblin's Mind

- They pulled the hobgoblin from the mirror, subdued him, and scoured his thoughts with Detect Thoughts.
- His mind revealed the army halted in the heat for 6–10 hours midway through each day.
- He envisioned battalions of about 800 with archers and 3–5 battle mages opening with fireballs, followed by volleys and an infantry charge.
- He showed the Iron Scourge served as transport and grew flesh the hobgoblins harvested for meat at camp.
- He recalled the Empress of Chaos vowing to corrupt the land at the Secret Heart so darkness would taint the waters before cities were plundered.
- They returned him to the mirror and merged his cell with Revka’s so she could work on him.

### Harassment Plans at Three Wells

- Council delegates and militias were rallied in Three Wells, with Delwath’s lynxes and ravens carrying orders across the plateau.
- Scrying on the Empress revealed an ash‑shrouded day camp where most hobgoblins slept while she patrolled the perimeter.
- The Empress detected the scrying and smothered the eye with living metal, leaving only strange, fleeting visions before the spell ended.
- The company resolved to launch daily long‑range harassment, aiming to disrupt the giant centipede and strike during the hottest‑hours camps.
- A fear‑sowing message plan was set, with speaking lynxes warning soldiers to abandon the Empress as elemental calamities befell them.
- Marcella shared news from Chardon—Fausto slain, Cadmos and Cassian dead, Hector en route, Vola bound for Aporia—and kept the Boots of False Tracks with Wellby’s blessing.
