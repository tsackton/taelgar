After reshaping [[Chardon]]'s [[chalyte]] order, the party receives a desperate plea for aid from [[Marcella]], teleports to the [[Aurbez Plateau]], scouts an ash‑shrouded hobgoblin host, and learns of the [[Empress of Chaos]]'s plan to spear the plateau's secret heart.

## Session Info
### Summary
- News of [[Dhrukmir]]’s death and the opening of a new [[chalyte]] source triggered  sweeping reforms in [[Chardon]]: the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] chartered the [[Imperial Chalyte Mining Company]], seized refineries, and created the [[Chalyte Refining Corporation]].
- [[Kenzo]] and [[Delwath]] engaged in tense negotiations to ensure rights for [[chalyte]] workers and fair positions in the leadership of the [[Chalyte Refining Corporation]], while [[Seeker]] researched information about the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] and [[Wellby]] got back in touch with his halfling roots.
- Weeks later, [[Sura]]’s urgent message drew the party east; they teleported to the [[Aursen Marshes|marshes]] of the upper [[Aursen]] to aid [[Marcella]].
- Night recon as great eagles led to an ash cloud masking a 400‑foot-long, shifting‑metal centipede behemoth venting ash and carrying thousands of [[hobgoblins]]; a [[Empress of Chaos|silver‑clad commander]] radiated a reality‑warping aura.
- An invisible ambush at the column’s tail dropped two riders; the party seized one with telekinesis and escaped via teleport before the commander could pinpoint them.
- Magical interrogation of the captured hobgoblin, [[Worldbuilding/Staging/Dunmar Frontier/Szoltar|Szoltár]], revealed the [[Empress of Chaos]]'s design: a Chaos Spear to pierce the plateau’s secret heart, harness [[Isingue]]’s magic and control the ooze titan, and then break the [[March of Andonne]] and consume the lands to the north and west.

## Narrative

Our session begins among the shattered remains of [[Dhrukmir]]'s lair, the dead body of the massive titan and his discarded, [[chalyte]]-studded club scattered across ruined buildings, as ogres flee and chaos reigns. In a circle of calm around the [[Dunmar Fellowship]], [[Brunnar]] of the stone giants speaks for those now free of [[Dhrukmir]]'s rule: his people would disperse, some heading east across the [[Myraeni Gap]] and others finding into solitary holds in [[Ulgrathar]]. They only asked only to be left alone. [[Seeker]] gathered [[chalyte]] shards, and the party retreated to [[Vindristjarna]], where [[Octavia Antussus]] was preparing to depart for [[Argento]] to bring the [[Chardonian Legion]] to secure the chalyte mines, while [[Tristan Brighteyes]] prepared to travel across the mountains and make contact with the Chardonian Navy in [[Darba]]. 

That evening, [[Kenzo]] spoke to the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] by dream-message, seeking guarantees that the power of the [[Chalyte Oligarchs of Chardon]] would be broken and their land turned over to him, as promised. The [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] answered with his gambit against the [[Curia of 42]], claiming the monopoly rights over [[chalyte]] refining for the new [[Chalyte Refining Corporation]], to be jointly controlled by the chalyte worker's guilds and the [[Windcallers]]. It would take time, he said, for plans to be settled, but he was eager to begin. The next morning, the party set off for [[Chardon]] in [[Vindristjarna]], to lend their weight to the work. 

[[Vindristjarna]] arrived in [[Chardon]] a few days later to find a city in flux. The [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] had already proclaimed the formation of the [[Imperial Chalyte Mining Company]] with monopoly rights in the [[Chataan Mountains]]. Soon after, the [[Patelios Family|Patelios]] and [[Veldari Family|Veldari]] families were convicted of bribery, all their properties seized, while the scions of the families fled north to [[Voltara]]. The [[Auratan Family|Auratan]] and [[Caloren Family|Caloren]] refineries were confiscated as punishment for allowing [[Fausto]] to gain control of the [[chalyte]] market. The [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]], now holding significant fractions of the land in the [[Ragwater Basin|Basin]] and some land in the [[Riverside Quarter]], concluded his deal with [[Kenzo]], leaving [[Kenzo]] the owner of a large swath of mostly-ruined land in the [[Ragwater Basin]], and several large blocks of falling-down slums along the [[Chasa|Chasa River]] in the [[Riverside Quarter]]. 

Weeks of work followed. [[Kenzo]] shuttled between [[Windcallers]], guild workers, and the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]], insisting the workers gain real footing. The settlement set equal seats for [[Windcallers]] and the new [[Guild of Chalyte Workers|worker's guilds]] on the corporation’s board, with the [[Mitus Verina Auratan|Magistros]] appointing members following [[Kenzo]]'s advice, and holding the tie-breaking vote, but agreeing to abstain from any decisions concerning profit-sharing. The [[Chalyte Refining Corporation]] took control of three of the safest and highest quality [[chalyte]] refineries, to continue [[chalyte]] production in the city, with the board controlling how profits would be reinvested. [[Kenzo]], now owner and landlord of vast swaths of ruined territory, began planning how to reinvigorate the community of his youth, while also helping establish and cement the power of the [[Guild of Chalyte Workers]]. 

Elsewhere, [[Delwath]] lent a silver tongue to talks and quietly chased rumors of the vanished [[elves]]. [[Seeker]] studied refinery craft and the [[Elemental Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]]. [[Wellby]] mapped dangers of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire|Plane of Fire]] and set the Saga of Apollyon to verse with halfling storytellers. In late July, news came of the settlement of a peace treaty with [[Dunmar]]: [[Darba]] ceded as a free port, with the [[Chardonian Empire]] paying a transfer fee to aid in reconstruction; the realm itself split in two between [[Sura]] and [[Nayan Karnas|Karnas]]. Also in late July, the [[Chataan Mountains]], the [[Imperial Chalyte Mining Company]] readied its first exploratory expeditions, [[Dhrukmir]]'s ogres having been quelled by the legions. By early August, [[Chardon]] steadied, though negotiations continued apace, a sense of normalcy returned to the city after months of turmoil and chaos. 

On [[Vindristjarna]], [[Hektor]], recovered enough to emerge from the [[Mirror of Soul Trapping]], found himself work on [[Vindristjarna]], joining the crew. [[Vola]], still troubled by being betrayed into magical bondage, left the city for [[Apporia]] to try to gain a new perspective and clear her mind. 

In early August, in the midst of tying up these loose ends, [[Wellby]]'s sending stone stirred with [[Sura]]'s voice. [[Marcella]], who had settled on the [[Aurbez Plateau]] after being freed by the party from [[Kadmos]], begged for help. Scouts in the Refounded Alliance of Arbez had seen a hobgoblin host moving out of the [[Plaguelands]] beneath a drifting shroud of ash. Numbers were unclear; more scouts had not returned. Militias were mustering, riders calling aid to every neighbor. The message was already eight days old.

Leaping immediately into action, the party returned to [[Vindristjarna]] and set out east, for the [[Aurbez Plateau]]. That evening, [[Delwath]] entered [[Marcella]]'s dreams. After a brief, urgent conversation, the party decided that speed was of the essence, and, using [[Marcella]]'s description of the [[Aursen Marshes]], trusted to [[Seeker]]'s unfailing ability to teleport anywhere to bring them to her immediately. Meanwhile, the crew kept [[Vindristjarna]] flying east.

[[Seeker]]'s spell brought them to a high plateau on a moonless night, through which a meandering river flowed around marshes and peat in a boggy basin. A few small houses clustered on dry ground, in a willow grove; a moment later, [[Marcella]] emerged from the houses and led the party away, up a stream to a small hillock, away from the children sleeping in the houses. She told them what she knew: the rapid approach of the [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]] army, the few paths that led up to the plateau, worry over the walled town of [[Aursenbourg]] guarding the crossing of the [[Aursen]], the stream of refugees already making their way to what safety they could find. 

The party immediately set off to scout, taking the shapes of great eagles to reach the ash cloud by dawn, and promising [[Marcella]] to find her the next day at the council meeting upriver at [[Three Wells]]. They flew as eagles through the night, following the river past a walled town and then over abandoned farmsteads. By dawn they were over the [[Plaguelands]], the land turned ashen and broken: torn hills, gray pools ringed with thorn-trees, and a limping seven‑legged beast that paid them no mind. Ahead lay an undulating ash cloud, wide and long, moving with arrhythmic booms like metal crushing stone.

They set down five miles ahead and hid among the rocks. [[Kenzo]] and [[Wellby]] scouted. The air stung with grit; ash spilled from the top of something, leaving a trail on the stone. [[Wellby]] sent his senses into a bat and guided it into the ash cloud. Inside, the ash broke to reveal massive centipede-like behemoth, at least 400 feet long, made of some strange shifting metallic flesh, its back split by gaping vents that breathed ash, seeming to glide across the ground and even up steep cliffs, passing over all obstacles in its way. Along its flanks, ringed platforms bore ranks of hobgoblins, numbering in the thousands. On the head of the creature a captain stood, armored in the same strange metal. A rider spotted the bat, killed it, and ate it. [[Kenzo]] felt only hobgoblin souls; the engine itself was empty. The ground beneath the thing seemed unstable, reality thinned.

The party let the column pass, hoping to seize a prisoner, or at least a corpse for questioning, from the end of the column. Hidden by a low blind of stacked rocks, [[Delwath]] breathed Sleep across the rear ranks. Two riders slipped and tumbled into the grit. [[Seeker]]’s unseen force hooked one and dragged him toward the blind while Delwath rewrapped allies and prisoner alike in invisibility.

The silver-clad commander lifted from the centipede’s prow, metal streaming and reknitting over her skin as she circled in flight. Finding one fallen hobgoblin, she landed to rouse him, and then began to spiral outward, searching carefully for his companion. Meanwhile, still hidden in their rock blind, the party examined their captive. He was tall, muscular hobgoblin, armored in mismatched but well-maintained armor, bearing a sigil: three jagged shards of a shattered crown, with three curling blades dripping beneath. 

With the search drawing close, Delwath woke the prisoner and whispered a bent desire: come with us, step through. As the commander banked toward their cover, Seeker quickly unleashed his Teleport spell before they were spotted, the rocks and ash vanishing from around them as they reappeared on the hillock, now in the morning sun, from which they set flight hours ago. As the party prepared to interrogate their prisoner, Delwath laid careful magic upon him, making enthusiastic storytelling his favorite activity. 

The prisoner named himself [[Szoltar|Szoltár]]. He strutted, boastful, but admitted he merely followed the [[Iron Fang]] clan, under the [[Empress of Chaos]]. He spoke of a chaos spear carried by the Empress, meant to pierce a place he called the secret heart. Doing so, the [[Empress of Chaos]] boasted, would corrupt the land and give her control over the magic of [[Isingue]], and the ooze titan that now dwelt there. The armies of the [[Iron Fang]] would ride forth with the leashed ooze creature, sweeping across all who stood in their path, and claiming all the land to the north and west for themselves. 

[[Szoltar|Szoltár]] boasted of a newly found chaos metal, discovered recently. The party concluded that somehow the unraveling of Apollyon’s prison caused strange chaos power to surge through the [[Plaguelands]].  With it, the Empress would take control of [[Isingue]], command the ooze, and take her revenge for past slights: the slaughter of [[Cha'mutte]], the betrayal of the [[Shattered Ice Clan]], and their long isolation in the [[Plaguelands]] at the hands of the humans. Our session ends as [[Szoltar|Szoltár]] sang the praises of the [[Empress of Chaos]] and the long-awaited salvation of the [[Iron Fang]] clan, while the party contemplated what, if anything, they could still learn from this creature. 

## Transcript of the Interrogation of Szoltár of the Iron Fang

_The hobgoblin stirs under enchantment, groggy, then sits upright. His eyes dart around the plateau before fixing on his captors. Standing, he draws his sword with a flourish, and begins to speak in Goblin._

**Szoltár:** A proper story must intimidate its listeners. Yes. Yes. I am Szoltár the Warrior. I have led armies… though I must speak the truth. I follow in armies. Yet we will win! The Empress of Chaos leads us, and she will bring victory. _(He drives his sword into the ground with force.)_ The Chaos Spear will pierce this fine earth, and our power will spread! _(He points his blade at Wellby, who cowers theatrically.)_ Yes, that’s right - cower. All of you are not scared enough by what is going to happen.

**Kenzo:** What’s going to happen?

**Szoltár:** The Empress of Chaos has been planning this, telling us stories of this moment for a decade. When she would breach the strongholds, corrupt the heart of the land, and take control of the magic of Isingue. How we could ride a monster to sweep across the lands! Then the March of Andonne, whatever they call it, those stupid castles to the north, would fall, and we could claim all the good farmland that should have been ours. All we need do is ride to victory atop the plateau. The Empress tells us she knows where the Secret Heart is! 

**Wellby:** Huh.

**Szoltár:** She will fly there, take her spear— _(he gestures, switching his sword to grip it like a spear)_ —and stab it through! And chaos will spread. Since she discovered the chaos metal just… months ago, everything has fallen into place. And now our plan is unstoppable! The puny humans, elves, dwarves, halflings—the pathetic creatures who live on this plateau—

**Delwath:** What about the tall Stoneborn, who are not puny?

**Szoltár:** They too shall be consumed by the chaos metal of the Empress. None will survive. 

**Kenzo (*aside*):** Nobody tell Seeker about this Chaos metal.

**Wellby:** Do all of our problems go back to emperors?

**Szoltár:** Empresses are not the cause of problems—they are the solution! We have dwelt in the scraplands east of the Istros for generations. But soon—when we control the ooze—we will not be living in the scraplands anymore!

**Kenzo:** What’s the—

**Szoltár:** You dare ask questions of the great Szoltár?

**Kenzo:** Oh, I do not dare, I do not dare, I do not dare. I only wish to learn about the ooze and the chaos metal—and is there a connection between the ooze and the chaos?

**Wellby:** I do not dare, I do not dare. And if we found out, we’d be even more intimidated than we already are.

**Kenzo:** So intimidated by these stories.

**Wellby:** The truthfulness intimidates us—as do the many fine details that explain the sequence of events that led to the present moment. That’s the most intimidating part of all.

**Szoltár:** You’re intimidated by history? What weaklings! Our history is grand! We have lived for many years, since the sad death of the great [[Cha'mutte]], in hiding. Those foolish humans thought they could kill us. Those foolish Shattered Ice hobgoblins thought they could drive us out. No! Even when we helped them, they betrayed us—left us to rot in the Plaguelands. And now… we finally have our chance! The Iron Fang will rule under the banner of the Empress of Chaos, and it’s all thanks to the magic that surged through our land just… three months ago. Two months ago. Some number of months ago.

**Wellby:** Huh.

**Kenzo:** What happened, then?

**Delwath**: That was a few days after Apollyon died, when his prison unraveled. 

**Kenzo:** I think we’d be really scared to learn more about that ooze. It sounds terrifying.

**Delwath:** We do need to know… where?

**Szoltár:** Near [[Isingue]], fools! But once the Empress of Chaos takes control of the magic, all will fall to her dominion. She will control everything. We are but her humble servants—and soon, so will you be.

## Detailed Summary

### Death Ray Destroyed, Politics Ignite

- Tristan Bright Eyes reports rapid approach to the Chataan Mountains; scouts spot a floating lightning tower; Captain Faldrak drops the team then retreats 30 miles; teleport assault planned.
- At noon, a message arrives: "Giant killed. Chalyte death ray destroyed. Chalyte is yours."
- Magistros Mitus Auratan acts immediately: denounces the four chalyte families for breach, shifts refining to Windcaller licensing, and declares exile for unlicensed holders; runners spread edicts citywide.
- At the crater, Bruner leads surviving stone giants away requesting to be left alone; ogres scatter; Dhrukmir’s chalyte-studded club and crushed gems lie abandoned; Seeker collects samples; Octavia and Tessis move to bring a legion from Argento; Tristan heads to contact the navy at Darba.
- Via Dream, Kenzo demands guarantees; the Magistros details his challenge to the Curia of 42 and a plan for a Chalyte Refining Corporation jointly run by Windcallers and a workers’ guild.
- With a legion en route and a one-week estimate, the party agrees to return to Chardon to assist politically and with worker outreach, prepared to teleport back if needed.

### Chardon Reshapes Chalyte and City

- Party returns July 9; Magistress charters Imperial Chalyte Mining Company (exclusive Chataan mining) and seizes Patelios/Valdari refineries for bribery.
- Magistrate’s deal: preserve 2–3 safe refineries for a new corporation, demolish the rest; grant the party equivalent slum land along the Chasa for redevelopment.
- Chalyte Refining Corporation set as sole legal refiner; board split between Windcallers and workers’ guild; Emperor appoints and holds final vote but will abstain on profit‑sharing to force consensus; chalyte use proposed as license‑only.
- Negotiations yield worker‑empowerment and reinvestment plan (use land proceeds to rebuild housing); Chardon stabilizes; first refining begins; imperial mining expedition departs for Chataan (ogres unresolved); two oligarch families decamp to Volterra; others penalized; public works expand.

### Marcella's Plea and Teleport to Arbez

- Sura contacts Wellby via Sending Stone with Marcella’s urgent letter: a hobgoblin army from the Plaguelands threatens the Refounded Alliance of Arbez; the message is already 8 days old.
- Messenger rode from Arbez to Tokra across mountain passes and monsoon plains (laming two horses); directs them to seek news at Arsenberg and escarpment watchtowers.
- Chardon-to-Arbez is ~1,170 miles due east; their airship would take ~4.5–5 days over the Elderwoods and the Sentinels—possibly too slow.
- They verify via Dream: Marcella reports an ash storm masking the army (500–5,000 uncertain), missing scouts, militias mustering, and aid requests sent to Stoneborn, Dunmari, Massau, Sambara, elves, and Orenbos.
- They choose to Teleport immediately using Marcella’s description (Arsene Marshes on the plateau near the Aursen River waterfall and walled Arsenberg); crew keeps the airship moving separately (e.g., Baldrick aboard).
- Buffs and resources set (sanctum temp HP, Aid +20 HP, Seeker 4 via Wish for extra slots); first Teleport roll is a mishap but rerolled with heroic inspiration to arrive successfully.

### Night Arrival and Eagle Recon Plan

- The party materializes on a moonless plateau near a meandering river and four small houses; Marcella spots them and leads them away to talk.
- Marcella briefs: hobgoblin army 4-7 days out (150-200 miles away), moving 25-30 miles/day; limited ascent routes (Austin's Crossing road with switchbacks and a watchtower, southern passes, scattered mule tracks); refugees and militias mobilizing.
- Plaguelands cited as likely origin; prior minor incursions like Sorrowsworn have occurred, but never a full army.
- Plan: depart immediately (2 AM) via Animal Shapes as eagles to scout the ash cloud; Teleport back using a linked object taken within six months (Seeker grabs fresh dirt; Seeker 4 can cast Animal Shapes).
- Marcella will attend a Ranger Council at Three Wells tomorrow afternoon (15 miles upriver); party intends to report back; rangers to watch for skyship Vintoshana in 4-5 days.
- Isengay discussion: holy to the cult of Beryl; city now slime-ruined with a 400-ft ooze that attacked them; speculate hobgoblins may be fleeing it.

### Invisible Recon of Hobgoblin War-Engine

- Overnight eagle flight: walled town with guards, abandoned farmsteads; by dawn ~120 miles, by 8 a.m. ~170 miles into ashen, warped terrain.
- Spot a vast ash cloud column ~20 miles ahead; land ~5 miles in front, go invisible; Kenzo senses 3–4k hobgoblins and reality instability beneath it.
- Advance to ~1 mile; acrid particulate ash coats air; Beast Sense bat enters cloud and finds a ~400‑ft shimmering centipede venting ash.
- Thousands of hobgoblins ride on side platforms/rings; a metallic‑sheathed leader with spear stands on a head platform.
- A hobgoblin grabs and eats the bat; the centipede has no soul (magical construct unknown); party plans to let it pass, then snipe/abduct a rear rider for interrogation and be ready to escape.

### Hobgoblin Heist Beneath the Centipede

- Party builds a rock blind under invisibility to ambush the mecha centipede convoy.
- Delwath casts Sleep on rear riders; two hobgoblins fall off; Seeker drags one toward the blind with Telekinesis.
- Delwath re-ups Invisibility via Distant Spell to include the captive, leaving one teammate to rely on hiding.
- Alarm screech sounds; a silver metal-clad hobgoblin commander flies back, revives the visible fallen, and begins a spiral search.
- Kenzo’s SoulSight reads the commander as CR ~26 with living metal armor, high Int/Cha, and a reality-warping aura.
- They wake the invisible captive; Delwath whispers a Subtle Suggestion to love teleporting; Seeker wins initiative and Teleports the party and prisoner back to the marsh at 9 a.m.

### Hobgoblin Reveals Empress of Chaos Plot

- Party opts for a quick interrogation; Delwath casts Glibness and Suggestion, skipping Detect Thoughts due to concentration; Sense the Truth is available.
- Suggestion succeeds; Sultar the hobgoblin becomes eager to truthfully share details.
- He serves the Empress of Chaos: plan is to pierce the plateau’s Secret Heart with a Chaos Spear, corrupt the land, seize Isengai’s magic, and ride a monster to conquer north (March of Adon).
- Recent discovery of Chaos metal enables the plan; Empress aims to control the ooze; Iron Fang army expects to rule; all peoples, including stoneborn, will be consumed.
- Timeline anchor: a magic surge followed Apollyon’s death and the unraveling of his prison; Sultar recounts Iron Fang history—betrayed by humans and Shattered Knife/Shattered Ice, exiled to Plaguelands and scraplands east of the Istros.
- Interrogation is paused for next week; players joke about not telling Seeker about the Chaos metal.
