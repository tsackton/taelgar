# The Heartroot Vision

The mirror goes dark, and the image flickers, eventually settling on starlight. You’re looking up at a starlit landscape that seems to undulate like a wave—but it looks like land. Then there’s a flash of light of some kind, but it registers in your eyes as almost the absence of darkness, rather than bright light itself. It’s something like you’ve never experienced before. The light begins to shoot upward from the center of the image you’re seeing, and the land pulls apart, then slowly begins to settle into form. As it does, you can tell that, while you’re looking from very far away, you can also somehow see clearly.

The land splits apart, and you see a line of light shooting upward. Even though you are far away, you’re also somehow close, and you see, growing out of the middle of this split in the land, the same bioluminescent, filamentous, white, multicolored strands crawling upward from within. Wellby—after you stare at this for a moment—you realize something. The line being pulled apart, the light shooting upward, the reshaping of the land itself—you recognize it. From maps you’ve studied, you realize it’s the exact pattern of the Istaros.

As you watch, riotous colors wash across the landscape, followed by a strange sense of separation—like layers of bubbles pulling apart, films of color peeling away from the world below, some expanding and growing while others burst and pop in flashes of indescribable color. Meanwhile, the only thing still illuminated is the light shining upward through the formation of the [[Istaros]]. You see those filamentous, glowing lines spreading outward along its length. 

After this moment of creation, the image shifts, blurring rapidly through years upon years. The perspective never changes. The only constant—always at the center, where the greatest density of the filaments once were—is green and alive. Winters pass, droughts come and go, the land shifts, but that heart remains.

**David Kong:** Like, that very first moment, where it’s, like, the thing cracks open or whatever… how old is that? Is that, like, does that feel like some beginning-of-time shit? Or, like, what is that?  
**Tim Sackton:** Yeah, yeah.  
**David Kong:** So, so this is like…  
**Tim Sackton:** That’s like when the planes were created. When the multiverse was made.  
**Eric Rosenbaum:** I was wondering if that’s what that was. Whoa.  
**David Kong:** The crown? When was the crown made?  
**Tim Sackton:** Same moment.  
**Mike Sackton:** Or, no, same time, yeah.  
**David Kong:** Very interesting. Very interesting.  
**Tim Sackton:** Well, that was, like, the mythology of Taelgar, right? There was, like, before the multiverse existed, all the gods just walked around the Earth. And then there was the Reeving, where all the magic got segregated out into the other planes so the Material Plane could exist as a real place. But there are all these little fragments of that moment. Like, the footprint of the gods that Kenzo went to in your solo adventure, that was also a relic of that same event, tied to the elemental planes.  
**Eric Rosenbaum:** I’m just looking at the river Istaros. We’ve been there before, haven’t we? Isn’t that the city… the rainbow orcs on their river?  
**Tim Sackton:** It flows right past. It’s also the same river that runs by Drankor.  
**Eric Rosenbaum:** Oh, I didn’t look that far south. That’s the same river.  
**Tim Sackton:** And if anybody looks at a map of the Feywild, it’s also exactly the path of the Sunset Gate.  
**Mike Sackton:** Does anybody have a map of the Feywild?  
**Tim Sackton:** Actually, probably nobody has the map they want.  
**David Schwartz:** Not, you know… I’ll try to guess it out.  
**Tim Sackton:** It just doesn’t match one-to-one. Like, fifty miles could be one mile or two hundred miles, but it’s close. There are features that overlap.  
**David Kong:** But is it still, like, the pinky bone’s connected to the hand bone kind of thing?  
**Tim Sackton:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It’s distorted, but it overlaps.  
**Eric Rosenbaum:** Is the Heartroot… symbiotic? Like, is the creature making up the roots itself distinct from whatever’s flowing through those glowing pulses? Like, is it a mycorrhizal situation?  
**Tim Sackton:** Well, right now you’re still watching the vision in the mirror. But, yeah. It’s a mycorrhizal thing. It’s, like, a massive symbiotic organism that makes everything it touches grow stronger and better. And it was created as a byproduct of the creation of the planes.  
**Eric Rosenbaum:** I’m just wondering if we should think of it as two entities together, as opposed to one.

You keep watching in the mirror, and you see again this passing of years and seasons — long stretches of time, the land growing and shrinking, always changing. But always, there’s this fertile ribbon along the upper Istaros, where Isingue is, or was, still standing, though it is now in ruins.

The image begins to drift down, closer and closer to the river itself. As your perspective zooms in, you can see it everywhere — in the soil, in the dirt — this richness, this pulse of life. What was once tightly contained — maybe in a ten-foot cube — is now free, stretching out along dozens of miles of the river, spreading up from the banks. The mirror shows that vibrancy, that living pulse.

Then the image shifts again. You see hobgoblins. You see the city of Isingue — not a big city, more like a large town — settled in rich agricultural valleys: small villages, vineyards, orchards, golden fields of wheat — everything lush and abundant. And then: hobgoblin armies marching. Converging on the city. Fighting. The city under siege. The scene plays like a sped-up animation — and then red mist begins to spread along the river. People dying by the hundreds, the thousands, tens of thousands. Fleeing in all directions.

You catch one stuttering image — something being shaken, twisted, then grabbed. Carefully, with reverence, but still yanked from its home. The mirror’s image spins around a dozen times, disorienting you, until finally you’re looking up at the sky.

Now the world feels smaller — the vast, open visions from before are gone. Instead of looking down on a wide, living world, you’re in a confined space of earth, looking up at a narrow patch of sky. There’s no sense of expansion anymore, no growth or vitality. Time passes strangely — seasons flicker by, days and nights wheel past — but there’s no real sense of how long.

Then the image stops. You see a jade figure standing in the valley — a wizard — looking up at the sky, speaking softly to it. He’s talking about the monks he’s met, how they’ve also seen the dangers of the remnants of [[Cha'mutte's plague]]. He thinks they’ll help. He’s worried about reaching Isingue alone, but with their support, it can be done. “The prison is stable,” he says. “Dimitar is watching it. We have a moment.” A voice answers from above, though you can’t see lips or hear words. You can tell it’s worried: that the hobgoblins might learn too much too soon. That if they uncover the secrets of isingue, they might discover the last relic of the Heartroot. Then comes planning — talk of an expedition, of closing a portal to Limbo that was opened by Cha’mutte’s death. Maybe sealing that breach would help.

And then, the image fades. The vision ends.
