# The Heartroot Vision
>[!info]+ Information

 And the vision begins to shift. And it… The image flickers. And eventually settles on… just, starlit, like, you're looking above at a starlit landscape that seems to be almost undulating like a wave, but it looks like land. And then there's this… flash of light of some kind, but it's… it registers in your eyes as almost the absence of darkness instead of bright light itself. It's… it's something like you've never experienced before. And… light begins to… shoot up, shoot up from the center of the… of the image that you're looking at, and the land pulls apart, and then… begins to settle slowly into form. And you can see… as it does, that, while you are clearly looking at something from very far away, you can also see…
 
 The land splits apart, and you see this line of light shooting up. And even though you are… far away, you are also somehow close, and you see growing out of this… the sort of middle of this line that's split apart in the land, like, the same little bioluminescent, filamentous, white, multicolored land, sort of almost crawling up out of this. And Wellby, after you stare at this a minute, you actually… I mean, this line that's being pulled apart, that's light shooting up a bit, that's somehow being formed by… reshaping of the actual physical Earth. You recognize it. From maps that you've looked at, it's…
 
 exactly the pattern of the Isteros.

 So, and as you, as you watch, you can see, suddenly, this sort of riotous colors, like, washing across the landscape, and then almost a sense of… of, like, you know, multiple layers of bubbles, like, separating, right? Like, there's, you know, like, if you have two soap bubbles, right, and they pull apart like that, and many of them begin to pop. Like, it's almost you see this sort of pulling off, these, like, films of color, like, pulling off of the world that you're looking at below. Meanwhile, well… you still see this… the only thing that's lit up is this… is the light shining up through the… formation of the Isteros. Meanwhile, you still see this, like, filamentous, sort of illuminated lines begin to crawl out along… the Isteros. And after this moment of creation… the image shifts, and it rapidly… blurs through years and years and years and years. The only… still in the same perspective, the only… constant, always in the middle, always at the center point where the greatest density of these filaments were, is green, and alive. And there's, you know, winters come through, and droughts, and the land shifts, yep.
 
David Kong: Like, that very first moment, where it's, like, the thing, like, cracks open, whatever, like… How old is that? Is that, like… does that feel like some beginning of time shit? Or, like, what is that?
Tim Sackton: Yeah, yeah.
David Kong: So, so this is like…
Tim Sackton: Like, that's like when the planes were… when the multiverse was created.
Eric Rosenbaum: I was wondering if that's what that was. Whoa.
David Kong: The crown? When was the crown made?
Tim Sackton: Same moment.
Mike Sackton: Or no, same time, yeah.
David Kong: Very interesting. Very interesting.
Tim Sackton: Well, that was, like, the mythology of Taelgar, is that there was… pre… like… before the multiverse existed, all… everybody, like, all the gods just walked around the Earth. And then there was the Reeving, where all the magic was segregated out into the extra… other planes, so that the material plane could exist as a real place. But there's all sorts of, like, little fragments of that moment. That's, like, the footprint of the gods that Kenzo went to in your solo adventure was also a relic of that same moment that was, like, tied to the elemental planes.
Eric Rosenbaum: I'm just looking at the river Isteros. We've… we've been there before. Haven't we? Isn't… is the city… The rainbow orcs on their river.
Tim Sackton: It flows right past. It also is the same river that flows past Drankor.
Eric Rosenbaum: Oh, I didn't look down that far south. That's the same river.
Tim Sackton: And, if anybody looks at a map of the Feywild, it is also exactly the path of the Sunset Gate.
Eric Rosenbaum: We have maps of the Feywild.
Mike Sackton: I think.
Eric Rosenbaum: Whoa.
Mike Sackton: Does anybody have a map of the Feywild?
Tim Sackton: Actually, probably nobody has a map of what they want.
Mike Sackton: I mean, I know what you're talking about, because I have that map of the Feywild, but I don't think it's in.
David Kong: Well, it's like, don't make sense, because it's not, like…
David Schwartz: Not, you know… I'll try to guess it out.
Tim Sackton: This just doesn't match one-to-one. So, 50 miles could be 1 mile or 200 miles, but it's close, right? There's features that overlap.
David Kong: But is it still, like, the pinky bone's connected to the hand bone type of thing?
Tim Sackton: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
David Kong: Like…
Eric Rosenbaum: If…
Tim Sackton: It's distorted, but it overlaps.
Eric Rosenbaum: Is the heartroot… symbiotic? In other words, like, is the creature making up the roots themselves distinct from whatever is flowing through the glowing pulses? Like, is it a mycorrhizome situation?
Tim Sackton: Well, right now, you're still watching the vision in the mirror. But, but yes, it is a mycorrhizal… thing, situation. It's a… it's like a massive symbiotic organism that… you know, makes everything it touches grow stronger and better… and was created when… as a byproduct of the creation of the planes.
Eric Rosenbaum: I'm just wondering if we should try to understand it as two entities together, as opposed to one.


So you keep watching in the mirror as Seeker wonders. And you see, again, this sort of… passing of the years and the seasons. Long time passing, and again, always, you know, growing and shrinking, right? But always this sort of fertile ribbon along the upper Isteros, where Isengen is, or was, still is, in ruins. And the… the image begins to drift down. Closer and closer to the river itself. And you can see, as you, as you sort of drift down, as your perspective kind of zooms in, just these, these sort of… everywhere you look, right? Everywhere you look along the soil and in the dirt, there's just this richness, right? This… this thing that is now tightly constrained to, you know, really a… you know, one valley, but even less than that, right? Like, a 10-foot by 10-foot cube, and now that it's, you know, free a little bit, it's stretching out a bit. It's spreading along dozens of miles of the river and growing up from the riverbanks, and you can… you can see in the mirror the sort of vibrancy. Until… the image shifts again. You see hobgoblins; you see the city of Isengen, which is not a big city, it's… it's really mostly a town. Richly settled. Agricultural valleys, you know, at best. You know, think, you know, this is like, this is like, you know, Provence, or somewhere, like, fertile, I don't know what the most fertile… agricultural region of France is, but, like, that's the vibe, right? It's, like, very small… small villages, but lots of them, and… vineyards and orchards and fields of wheat, just everything rich and lush. And hobgoblins marching, large hobgoblin armies converging on the city. Fighting. The city under siege. This is like a sort of sped-up animation, and then red mist beginning to spread… along the river. People dying, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of people dying. Fleeing in all directions. And one… stuttering image of being shaken and twisted and then grabbed… carefully, and with great reverence, but still yanked out of your home. The mirror… the image in the mirror spins around, like, a dozen times, like, disorienting you. And then, you just are looking up at the sky. And you see… in the mirror, like, this sense of, like, the world shrinking around… shrinking, like, wherever… before, the visions were, like, expansive and… long and wide, right, like… seen from this great perspective, looking down on the earth, now you're… in the sort of constrained part of the earth, looking up at a narrow patch of sky. But the exact opposite; no sense of, like, this sort of expansive growth. And no sense of, like, movement or vitality or anything. As time passes again, vision speeds up and slows down. You can see the seasons passing, you can see the sun, the days passing. But you have no real sense of… of… length. Until… you see this image stops. And you see a jade figure standing in this valley, a wizard. Looking up at the sky. And he seems to be talking… to the night sky. 

Talking on and on, like, you know. Rye is saying about how these, you know, he's met these monks who have also seen the… dangers of… the plague… relics; like… he thinks they'll help. Worried about trying to reach Isengen by himself, but… with their support, can be done. You know, the prison is stable, Dimitar is watching it. We have a moment. And the voice from the sky is saying something, but there's no lips to read, so you can't hear it, but you can infer from the other half of the conversation. Worry that… the hobgoblins… might learn… too much too soon. And we better… do something, because if they uncover the secrets of Isengen, they might learn about the last… relic of the heartroot. And then… planning… for an expedition. Close the portal. A lot of discussion about a portal to Limbo. Opened by Cha'mutte's death. And if there was a way to close the portal, that might help. And then the image fades. And the vision ends.
