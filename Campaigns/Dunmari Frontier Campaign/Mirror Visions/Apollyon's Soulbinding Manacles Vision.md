# Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles Vision

For a moment, the room goes dark, and you see [[Apollyon]] standing with his back turned, viewed from the perspective of the manacles. He is standing by the forge, wearing the [[Crown of Purity|crown]] that you have previously seen [[People/Chardonians/Fausto]] possess, along with the [[Cloak of Rainbows|Cloak of Rainbows]]. [[Apollyon]] is hammering something on the forge, working some kind of metal, periodically turning to inspect a partially forged dagger. The [[Apollyon's Phylactery|dagger]] appears very plain, with an unadorned iron hilt, but the blade seems to be made of layers upon layers of metal that has been beaten, worked, and sharpened. And there's writing on the blade, which seems to be part of some incantation or spell. The forging continues, and then stops again. [[Apollyon]] he takes like this sheet of this strange-looking metal--[[Seeker]] recognizes it as adamantium, the same metal that holds the [[Phasing Stones|phasing stone]] in place on [[Vindristjarna]]. Letters appear on this thin sheet of this metal, by magic, and [[Apollyon]] puts the dagger down and  wraps the metal around it. And he starts beating it again. This goes on fo a while. It seems like he's just doing layer after layer. He's putting some spells on it and then beating something into the dagger. 

Then the scene shifts, and it seems some time later. And there is—like, you can't quite see what it is. But there's clearly a person chained in the [[Apollyon's Soulbinding Manacles|manacles]]. But your perspective is looking towards the manacles. So you  just see wrists. And then the wrists go limp. And you can see slashes, the dagger slashing the wrists, the blood runs down into the floor, running down the arms. But there's some spark that runs into the dagger from the manacles. And this happens again and again. And the floor now, you can see this well in the middle. It's filling up with blood of people, many people, eventually darkening and thickening as it dries. 

The mirror shifts again. You can see now [[Apollyon]] standing, the manacles empty, and he is kneeling on the floor. The blood all dried except for in this very well in the center, which now looks black. And he draws a clear vial,  a potion vial, out from his robes. [[Apollyon]] draws a clear potion vial from his robes, and shadowy energy flows from the gems in his crown into the blood. It begins to swirl. And this sort of dark black viscous liquid floats up and pours itself into the vial, which he then seal, and the vision ends.

[[Seeker]] recalls that the lore of liches states that to become a lich, one must create a phylactery and then brew a potion, using the souls of those who fed the phylactery. Upon drinking this potion, the transformation into a lich is complete. The dagger is clearly [[Apollyon]]'s phylactery—plain and unadorned, yet forged of adamantium, the key to his dark ritual.
